Stock market today: Indian equity benchmark indices, Nifty50 and BSE Sensex , made a strong recovery on Wednesday, ending an eight-session decline. The Sensex rose by 715 points, driven by strategic purchases in banking and financial sectors after the RBI maintained interest rates and increased growth projections to 6.8 per cent for the current fiscal year.Positive global market sentiment and reduced crude oil prices encouraged local investors to engage in value buying across sectors, according to market participants.The BSE Sensex increased by 715.69 points or 0.89 per cent, closing at 80,983.31.

What is TrumpRx? Donald Trump announces new website to offer discounted drug prices; savings expected to reach 50%,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/what-is-trumprx-donald-trump-announces-new-website-to-offer-discounted-drug-prices-savings-expected-to-reach-50/articleshow/124246331.cms,"AP file photo





US president Donald Trump on Tuesday announced the launch of a new federal website, TrumpRx.gov, as part of a deal with Pfizer to offer prescription drugs directly to consumers at discounted prices. The initiative, aimed at cutting healthcare costs, is expected to grow with more deals from other drugmakers in the coming months.The new website is part of a broader push to align US drug prices with those in other developed nations, a strategy known as “most-favored-nation” pricing. Under the deal, Pfizer agreed to offer the same prices for new drugs in both the US and other advanced markets.“The United States is done subsidizing the health care of the rest of the world,” Trump said in a press conference. ""They put all of that on us, and yet they were the beneficiaries too. So it's been changed.""A senior administration official said Tuesday that the TrumpRx site, set to launch in early 2026, will not directly sell or distribute medications. Instead, consumers will be able to search for their prescriptions and be redirected to drugmakers’ direct-to-consumer platforms, as cited by CNN.Pfizer said most of its primary care drugs will be offered through TrumpRx, though it did not specify which ones.The company also announced plans to invest an additional $70 billion (£52 billion) in US manufacturing, research, and development.""We now have the certainty and stability we need on two critical fronts, tariffs and pricing,” Pfizer’s chief executive, Albert Bourla, said, as reported by the BBC.According to a company press release, direct-to-consumer prices for Pfizer drugs on TrumpRx.gov will average 50 percent lower. However, key details on how those discounts were determined were not provided. “Specific terms of the agreement remain confidential,” the release stateThe administration on Tuesday clarified that “Most Favored Nation” pricing is based on a drug’s net price, including discounts and rebates, compared with the lowest price in other wealthy countries such as Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK, Switzerland, and Denmark. This lowest international price then serves as the benchmark for US pricing.Pfizer, the first drugmaker to fully meet the demands outlined in Trump’s July letter to industry CEOs, plans to offer Medicaid “Most Favored Nation” pricing starting in early 2026, with the president indicating other companies may follow.Trump has often highlighted that Americans pay significantly more for prescription drugs than people in other developed nations, especially in Europe, where governments frequently set prices. A Health and Human Services report last year found US drug prices to be nearly three times higher than in comparable countries. During his first term, Trump unsuccessfully pushed for a “Most Favored Nation” pricing policy to address the gap.","Donald Trump on Tuesday announced the launch of a new federal website, TrumpRx.gov, as part of a deal with Pfizer to offer prescription drugs directly to consumers at discounted prices.

Gold price prediction today: Will stellar gold rally run continue in the near term?

(AI image)

Gold Price Outlook:

Weekly View: Volatile week ahead for precious metals

(Disclaimer: Recommendations and views on the stock market and other asset classes given by experts are their own. These opinions do not represent the views of The Times of India)





Gold price prediction today: Gold and silver prices are poised for a long-term bull run, though there may be short term volatility due to global factors, says Maneesh Sharma, AVP - Commodities & Currencies, Anand Rathi Shares and Stock Brokers. He shares his views and recommendations for gold and silver investors:Gold continued to shine bright at the start of the current week, climbing past $3,800 per oz for the first time ever in Spot markets. The Yellow metal printed yet another all-time high near $3,871 in Spot on Tuesday after spending much of last week consolidating just below the previous all-time high near $3,791. This was due to positive momentum which returned following the release of the US Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) inflation report. While the data came in broadly as expected, bets remain elevated that the US Fed might continue easing its rates in the upcoming meeting in October favoring sentiments in Gold & Silver.Meanwhile in the current week the US faces the risk of a government shutdown effective 1st October unless Congress agrees on new funding legislation. Republican leaders in the House pushed a stopgap bill to extend funding through November 21, but Senate Democrats have refused to back it without policy concessions.The dollar had suffered from rising risk of a US government shutdown and falling oil prices since the weekend, with safe haven currencies like yen emerging as the top performer. President Trump had already stated that a shutdown is now likely after little progress on congressional negotiations. In case of a shutdown, a lower Yen may well remain the favourite trade as history shows it lost 1.5% during the 2018-19 shutdown.Finally, focus also remains on US data due later in the week, with the closely monitored JOLTS report due on Tuesday followed by Payrolls on Friday. An upside surprise in US payrolls may bring in volatility in prices, but data might also be delayed due to the risk of shutdown. An extended shutdown may also result in profit booking moves in global equities leading to risk of a near term correction in prices especially in Silver complex.Brace for high volatility in bullion prices especially in silver, on a weekly basis as markets witness a data heavy week along with US shutdown risk to persist in the current week. The department of labor had said that the release of economic data, including Non farm payrolls would be suspended if a US shutdown takes place, which could again bring back safe haven appeal in gold on medium term basis.Any major corrective move in global equities in case of US shutdown in near term, needs to be watched out which could limit upside especially in silver prices. This is due the fact that silver had already witnessed a run up of up to 50 % in prices since 21st of April, the day where Gold hit an all time peak, while gold prices are up only 12 – 13 % since then.Again Gold/Silver ratio which has declined to almost 80 levels on Friday (in International Spot markets) from a high of 107 hit on 21st April is now poised to bounce back in near term to 84 – 85 levels indicating Silver may witness more downside moves as compared to Gold in near term.However from a medium to long term perspective, Gold is still poised to continue its bull run as it may test a level $ 3,950 – 4,000 per oz in spot markets by the end of 2025 or by the start of next year. Long term bias in Silver prices also remains positive as a breach of all-time highs in International markets (hit in Apr 2011 around $ 49.60) could be witnessed by the start of next year.","Gold and silver prices are poised for a long-term bull run, says Maneesh Sharma, AVP - Commodities & Currencies, Anand Rathi Shares and Stock Brokers.

Limits On Loans Against Shares Hiked 5x To ₹1cr

Measures complement govt’s reforms: Guv

Consumer optimum up





MUMBAI: Reserve Bank of India unveiled on Wednesday its most comprehensive reforms in over a decade, aimed at countering US-driven headwinds and expanding credit to companies, while deepening capital market activity. Banks can now finance mergers and acquisitions, and IPOs more freely, while limits on loans against shares and listed debt securities have been raised.Central to the measures is the easing of borrowing rules for companies with bank loans above Rs 10,000 crore, removing the previous cap and extra capital requirements that made lending costly.Credit concentration will continue to be monitored at individual banks, with system-wide safeguards deployed only if necessary, allowing for cheaper, more accessible corporate credit, improved bank capital efficiency, and broader participation in capital markets.Loans against shares have been increased from Rs 20 lakh to Rs 1 crore per individual, and IPO financing limits have raised from Rs 10 lakh to Rs 25 lakh per person. RBI has also proposed removing the ceiling on lending against listed debt securities, giving banks greater flexibility to support investors. Effective Oct 2025, these changes are expected to expand credit access, improve liquidity, and encourage wider participation in equity markets.Indian banks were hitherto barred from directly funding acquisitions through leveraged buyouts, or promoter stake purchases due to RBI curbs on share-based lending, forcing corporates to tap NBFCs, alternate investment funds, bonds, or foreign lenders, with rare exceptions under insolvency law. They could finance projects, capex, or working capital, but not equity takeovers, nor use target shares as collateral. Now, RBI has lifted this prohibition, creating a formal risk-managed framework that lets banks fund mergers, acquisitions, and corporate takeovers.According to Katalyst Advisors’ partner Binoy Parikh, allowing banks to participate in acquisition financing would be a structural shift for India’s credit markets. “For decades, Indian acquirers have been forced to rely on expensive private credit, NBFCs, or offshore lenders to fund takeovers, while domestic banks watched from the sidelines. Allowing banks into this space not only lowers the cost of capital for Indian businesses but also plugs a strategic gap where our banking sector has lagged global peers,” Parikh said. Leveraged buyouts, which involve using bank loans to finance M&As while offering the target company’s assets as collateral — have been widely used in the West but have been restricted in India.A report by SBI said that in 2024, M&A deals were valued at over $120 billion (around Rs 10 lakh crore). Assuming a debt component of 40% of M&A and 30% of this could be financed by banks, this translates into a potential credit growth of Rs 1.2 lakh crore.Announcing the measures, RBI governor Sanjay Malhotra said the measures complemented govt’s reform of GST and formed part of a coordinated effort across fiscal, monetary, regulatory, and other public policies to support the economy and advance the goal of a developed nation.Banks will phase in the expected credit loss framework for provisioning, replacing the incurred loss model with a glide path to minimise disruption. Draft Basel III credit risk guidelines and revised rules on forms of bank business and investments will align banks with global standards while providing operational flexibility. External commercial borrowing norms have been relaxed, broadening the eligible borrower and lender base, easing end-use restrictions, and simplifying reporting. Risk weights for NBFC infrastructure lending and housing finance have been lowered to reflect the lower risk of operational projects, and licensing for new urban cooperative banks will resume after a two-decade pause.Lending limits for REITs, InvITs, and listed debt securities have been expanded, accompanied by a principle-based framework for capital market intermediaries. Over 250 regulatory instructions have been consolidated into master directions to reduce compliance costs. Transaction account restrictions have been eased. Exporters will get extended timelines for repatriation from IFSC accounts, merchanting trade transactions will allow a six-month forex outlay, and special rupee vostro accounts can invest in corporate bonds and commercial papers. The Integrated Ombudsman Scheme will now cover state and district cooperative banks.","Banks can now finance mergers and acquisitions, and IPOs more freely, while limits on loans against shares and listed debt securities have been raised.

NEW DELHI: As companies from the EFTA Bloc — Switzerland, Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein — promised investment into India as part of the $100 billion commitment under the trade deal, Swiss state secretary for economic affairs Helene Budliger Artieda called for the need for a bilateral investment treaty(BIT), while Liechtenstein sought a double taxation avoidance agreement.At an event to mark the implementation of the Trade and Economic Partnership Agreement (TEPA), pharma giant Roche Holding committed to invest $1.8 billion into its core business over the next five years. There were at least 18 other companies that committed to invest in India over the next three-five years.While a trade deal was finalised around 18 months ago, BIT has been held up as the finance ministry has so far not agreed to make changes to the model treaty, which is not acceptable to most countries.But that has not stopped companies in the four EFTA countries from seeking to invest more in return for India offering lower or zero duty import of most items from the trading bloc, including Swiss chocolates and watches.While TEPA includes a commitment from the bloc for investments of $100 billion in India over 15 years, commerce minister Piyush Goyal said he had received assurances of another $150 billion in investments, but after the finalisation of data exclusivity in India’s IP laws.“Given robust intellectual property laws and enforcement in India… we are hoping to attract much more than that,” he said.He argued that it is the first trade agreement to incorporate a firm investment commitment, helping balance the interests and ensuring fairness between partners.The minister described the pact as a “trusted partnership between friends” at a time of global trade turbulence. “It signifies a solid vote of confidence between the four-nation EFTA and India, between the businesses of our five countries. It signals new beginnings, happy tidings and huge opportunity for businesses on both sides,” he said.As part of the agreement, India is offering duty concessions on 82.7% products, covering 95.3% of EFTA exports. Sectors such as dairy, soya, coal and sensitive agricultural products are, however, excluded from tariff reduction commitments.",Swiss state secretary for economic affairs Helene Budliger Artieda called for the need for a bilateral investment treaty.

NEW DELHI: Manufacturing activity moderated in Sept compared to the previous month, but remained robust, as new orders slowed and job creation slipped to a one-year low while selling prices hit a 12-year high, a survey showed on Wednesday.At 57.7 in Sept, down from 59.3 in Aug, the HSBC India Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index pointed to the weakest improvement in the health of the sector since May. The 50-point mark separates expansion from contraction in the survey compiled from responses to a questionnaire sent to 400 manufacturing companies.Amid reports of demand buoyancy, new business volumes rose further in Sept. The rate of expansion was sharp but eased to a four-month low. Growth was curbed by competitive conditions, anecdotal evidence showed. Production levels increased at a substantial pace that was the weakest since May, according to the survey results. It showed that there was a pick-up in the growth of global orders at the end of the second fiscal quarter, as manufacturers welcomed improvements in demand from Asia, Europe, the Americas, and West Asia. “New export orders increased at a faster rate in Sept, indicating demand outside of the US might be offsetting any decline in demand from the US as a result of tariffs,” said Pranjul Bhandari, chief India economist at HSBC.","HSBC India Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index was 57.7 in Sept, down from 59.3 in Aug.

MUMBAI: RBI has taken a series of steps to bolster consumer protection in the financial sector, starting with a move that makes access to digital banking a basic entitlement for holders of Jan Dhan and other no-frills accounts.RBI said it will review the framework for basic accounts, which are offered without minimum balance requirements, to ensure they keep pace with changing customer needs. This is aimed at making such accounts — key for financial inclusion — more affordable and digitally enabled.In a parallel step to safeguard depositors, the central bank announced that the Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation (DICGC) will shift to a risk-based premium framework. This will encourage stronger banks to adopt sounder practices, while reinforcing the safety net for depositors in case of bank failures. For grievance redressal, RBI proposed significant strengthening of the internal ombudsman (IO) mechanism within regulated entities. IOs will be empowered to award compensation and directly interact with complainants.","RBI said it will review the framework for basic accounts to ensure they keep pace with changing customer needs.

Going full throttle





NEW DELHI: Significant price cuts post GST reduction saw retail of cars and SUVs hit record numbers in Sept with the festive fervour adding to the excitement. Companies say that the strong momentum is likely to continue till Diwali later this month even though there could be challenges in catering to the rush. Maruti , which benefitted particularly from the GST cut on small cars, is likely to retail a record 2-lakh units during Sept 22 (the first day of Navratri) and Oct 2 (Dussehra).Partho Banerjee, senior executive officer (marketing & sales) at Maruti Suzuki , said demand continues to remain strong with new-launch Victoris already stocked out.

2nd straight pause





MUMBAI: RBI’s monetary policy committee on Wednesday unanimously voted to keep the repo rate unchanged at 5.5% with a neutral stance, while hiking FY26 growth forecast to 6.8% from 6.5%.“Since we last met in June, inflation has come down by about 1%. It is now at 2.6–2.7% compared with our earlier forecast. That’s the reason we now see more space opening up,” governor Sanjay Malhotra said. On growth, he added, “Growth has surprised us on the upside in Q1.In Q3, Q4, and even for next year there has been a slight downward revision, mainly because of the 50% tariff that has come into play, though it is partly offset by GST ... The revision is largely due to these trade-related developments, where negotiations are still ongoing.” RBI projects FY26 GDP growth at 6.8% (6.5% earlier) and inflation at 2.6% (3.1% earlier).Malhotra said India’s outlook remains resilient, supported by a good monsoon, rural demand, buoyant services, rising capacity use and GST rationalisation, though exports face tariff headwinds. Inflation has eased sharply on lower food prices and GST cuts, with prospects of staying contained given good sowing, grain stocks & benign supply.Since Feb 2025, RBI has cut rates by 100bps (1 percentage point) to support growth, with the impact still transmitting. The MPC noted easing inflation but flagged risks, while growth is evolving in line with projections.Malhotra said: “The current macroeconomic conditions and outlook have opened up policy space for further supporting growth, but it is prudent to wait for the impact of past actions and fiscal measures to play out. We remain watchful of global uncertainties and their spillovers.”","Since Feb 2025, RBI has cut rates by 100bps (1 percentage point) to support growth.

Collections from imports surge





NEW DELHI: GST collections rose 9.1%, the fastest pace of expansion in four months, to Rs 1,89,017 crore in Sept, indicating that the impact of the announcement of a rate reduction did not significantly dent sales.Domestic collections in Sept — for transactions in Aug — were up 6.8% to Rs 1,36,525 crore as consumers deferred big ticket purchases, such as automobiles and white goods. In contrast, there was a 15.6% increase in the kitty from imports to Rs 52,492 crore.“The increase in gross GST collections indicates that there has not been any significant slowdown in economic activity in anticipation of the GST rate cuts during the month of Aug 2025 as this data relates to transactions in Aug 2025,” said MS Mani, partner at Deloitte India.On Aug 15, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the Centre’s push to reduce rates ahead of Diwali . GST Council decided on the reduction on Sept 3 with the new rates kicking in from Sept 22.Weak sales of products such as automobiles were visible on cess as collections fell 2.4% to Rs 11,652 crore. Cess on imports almost halved to Rs 462 crore, while it was 1.8% higher on domestic sales at Rs 11,190 crore.On a net basis, overall GST collections were 5% higher at Rs 1.6 lakh crore, as refunds soared 40% to Rs 28,657 crore.“Growth of about 7% in domestic GST revenues over Sept 2024 is encouraging, particularly because of a slowdown in demand in the second half of Aug, in anticipation of rate cuts. A 40% increase in refunds also means that businesses are realising cash faster, both in case of inverted duty cases and exports. Govt will be closely monitoring the collections for next couple of months now to see the impact due to massive rate cuts under GST 2.0 and the extent to which it enhances the consumption,” said Pratik Jain, partner at consulting firm Price Waterhouse & Co.Meghalaya, Sikkim and Madhya Pradesh notched up over 20% growth in collections, while Telangana, Himachal Pradesh, Delhi and Manipur were laggards, registering a fall in collections.","GST collections rose 9.1%, the fastest pace of expansion in four months, to Rs 1,89,017 crore in Sept.

The US private sector lost 32,000 jobs in September, according to payroll processor ADP, defying analysts’ expectations of employment growth. The biggest losses came in leisure and hospitality, professional services, and financial activities, AFP reported.Hiring also contracted in trade, transportation and utilities, along with manufacturing, the report showed.“Despite the strong economic growth we saw in the second quarter, this month's release further validates what we've been seeing in the labor market, that US employers have been cautious with hiring,” said ADP chief economist Nela Richardson in a statement.Salaries rose 4.5 percent year-on-year, a rate that ADP said was “little changed.” Pay gains for job-switchers slowed to 6.6 percent in September from 7.1 percent in August.ADP noted that the monthly reduction reflected an annual preliminary adjustment of its figures based on 2024 results from the quarterly census of employment and wages. After this benchmarking, September’s job losses came to 43,000.The report comes as US policymakers watch the labour market closely. The Federal Reserve cut interest rates for the first time this year in September amid employment concerns.

Economic fallout and market jitters



Services disrupted and federal spending at risk



What happened during the last shutdown?



(With inputs from agencies)





The United States plunged into a government shutdown on Wednesday after President Donald Trump and Congress failed to pass a funding bill, leaving hundreds of thousands of federal workers furloughed and numerous services suspended. Roughly 750,000 federal employees will be taking unpaid leave each day, with a total daily cost estimated at $400 million (£297 million), according to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO).Trump, speaking at the White House before the deadline, acknowledged the looming closure. “We don't want it to shut down,” he said, but private talks with congressional leaders yielded no compromise to avert a shutdown. This marks the third federal funding lapse overseen by Trump, highlighting a deeply polarised political climate in Washington that rewards hardline positions over traditional compromise.“This is more than a political tussle shutdowns inflict economic cost, fear and confusion across the country,” said Rachel Snyderman, former White House budget official and managing director of economic policy at the Bipartisan Policy Centre.US futures fell following the shutdown, with the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average down 0.6%, while the Nasdaq ticked slightly higher. Global markets reacted cautiously: Germany’s DAX and France’s CAC 40 slipped, while Britain’s FTSE rose modestly.The government’s monthly jobs report, due on Friday, may also be delayed, further increasing economic uncertainty. Previous shutdowns have disrupted data collection and federal reporting, affecting decision-making by businesses and investors. Airline operations, while considered “essential,” may face delays as air traffic controllers and TSA staff often call in sick during extended closures, as seen in the 2018–19 shutdown.During that 35-day shutdown the longest in US history the economy lost an estimated $3 billion in GDP. Approximately 300,000 federal workers were furloughed, with delayed payments for those deemed essential. Disruptions affected air travel, law enforcement, Coast Guard families, and food safety inspections, demonstrating the far-reaching consequences of a prolonged funding lapse.Some programmes, such as Medicare, Medicaid, and the Pentagon, continue to operate, though staffing shortages may cause delays. Trump has indicated that services favoured by Democrats could be cut as part of the administration’s broader effort to reduce federal employment. Smithsonian museums are staying open temporarily, while national parks face potential closure amid safety concerns.Federal law enforcement and border protection personnel continue working, often without pay. TSA officers and air traffic controllers remain on duty, though previous shutdowns revealed that understaffing and fatigue can compromise efficiency and safety. Government websites and agencies have also faced operational risks; security certificates for more than 80 official websites, including the Department of Justice and NASA, have expired during previous funding gaps.Members of Congress continue to receive their salaries, as required by the U.S. Constitution. Military personnel are required to work but will only be paid retroactively. The CBO notes that daily costs will fluctuate depending on the number of furloughed employees, but even a short shutdown can delay billions in federal spending, suspend purchases of goods and services, and disrupt critical programmes.Unlike past funding lapses, the Trump administration appears willing to sustain a prolonged shutdown, using it as a tool to identify “non-essential” employees for permanent removal. “We'll be laying off a lot of people,” Trump said before the deadline. This aggressive approach contrasts with earlier shutdowns, which were typically seen as politically risky and economically disruptive enough to prompt rapid resolution.The 2018–19 shutdown, caused by a standoff over border wall funding, illustrated the human and economic toll: Coast Guard families relied on food pantries, the FBI faced strained resources, and the FDA suspended most inspections, raising public safety concerns. Once resolved, federal operations largely returned to normal, but this time, the administration’s ongoing efforts to cut spending and reduce personnel may extend the disruption and magnify its costs.The standoff also has political ramifications. Democrats are pushing for health care subsidies under the Affordable Care Act, while Republicans and the White House resist linking negotiations on spending to ongoing government operations. Failure to reach a compromise threatens both domestic services and broader economic stability, with investors, employees, and businesses left in uncertainty.","The United States plunged into a government shutdown on Wednesday after President Donald Trump and Congress failed to pass a funding bill.

What is China’s K Visa?

So who qualifies for China's K visa?

International graduates holding bachelor's or higher degrees in STEM disciplines from prestigious universities or research centres globally or within the country (additional information about qualifying institutions forthcoming);

Young foreign professionals currently working in education and research roles within STEM-related domains.

And what are the benefits of K visa?

Length of residency: Offers enhanced flexibility regarding entry frequency and validity duration compared to standard visa categories currently available.

Permitted activities: Includes participation in educational, scientific, technological, cultural, entrepreneurial and commercial collaborative endeavours.

Entry criteria: Eliminates requirement for local company sponsorship, focusing instead on applicant's age, academic qualifications, or professional experience as determining factors.

Is China’s K visa the counter to Trump’s H-1B visa crackdown?

China K visa : The challenges

China’s K visa programme implementation faces several obstacles. The Chinese authorities have specified unclear requirements relating to ""age, educational background and work experience"".

The policy lacks transparency regarding monetary benefits, job placement support, long-term residency options and provisions for bringing family members.

China rarely grants citizenship to foreign nationals, unlike US immigration policies.

The predominant use of Mandarin in Chinese technology companies creates significant obstacles for professionals who don't speak the language.





China’s newly introduced K visa category, which is effective from October 1, 2025, is widely being seen as a counter (though not official!) to the Donald Trump administration’s crackdown on the H-1B visa programme. At a time when the US is imposing stricter immigration policies, China is clearly signalling an intent to ‘welcome’ global talent.The newly introduced K visa, announced in August, aims to attract young international STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) graduates by offering entry, residency and work authorization without requiring any prior work offer.Although China has abundant local engineering expertise, the K visa initiative forms part of Beijing's strategy to present itself as welcoming to international investment and skilled professionals, especially as US trade restrictions create uncertainty in China's economic landscape.The Trump administration recently hiked the H-1B visa application fee to $100,000, a move that sent shockwaves globally, and especially in the Indian IT sector which is a big beneficiary of this particular visa programme. The US is also looking to do away with the current H-1B visa lottery system, replacing it with a weighted system for visa allotment.In this backdrop, China’s K visa could potentially strengthen its position against the US in their geopolitical competition. What is China’s K visa, what are its application criteria, benefits, and challenges? We take a look:According to a KPMG analysis, China established the R visa for highly skilled professionals in 2013, but the introduction of the K visa specifically aims to attract foreign youth talent in science and technology fields.K visa holders will benefit from increased flexibility in managing their activities within China, facilitating broader scientific and technological cultural exchange programmes, says KPMG.China’s K visa could present an attractive option for overseas professionals seeking alternatives to US employment opportunities. Several countries, including South Korea, Germany and New Zealand, are implementing more accessible visa regulations to draw skilled migrants.Beijing has implemented various policies to encourage foreign investment and travel, including expanding access for international investors across multiple sectors and removing visa requirements for nationals from most European nations, Japan, South Korea and others.""The symbolism is powerful: while the US raises barriers, China is lowering them,"" notes Iowa-based immigration attorney Matt Mauntel-Medici according to a Reuters report.The Trump administration's recent announcement of a $100,000 annual fee requirement for H-1B worker visas, commonly utilised by technology firms for skilled foreign recruitment, has created new opportunities. ""The US has definitely shot itself in the foot on H-1Bs, and the timing is exquisite for China's K visa,"" noted Michael Feller, chief strategist at Geopolitical Strategy.Immigration specialists highlight that the K visa's primary advantage lies in eliminating the need for employer sponsorship, traditionally a significant obstacle for H-1B applicants.The H-1B programme's current structure requires company sponsorship and operates through a lottery system limited to 85,000 positions annually, with the newly proposed fee potentially discouraging first-time applicants.""It's an appealing alternative for Indian STEM professionals seeking flexible, streamlined visa options,"" Bikash Kali Das, an Indian student at Sichuan University told Reuters. Indians represented the largest group of H-1B recipients last year, comprising 71% of successful applicants.The diplomatic friction between India and China might restrict the intake of Indian professionals under the K visa programme, experts told Reuters.""China will need to ensure Indian citizens feel welcome and can do meaningful work without Mandarin,"" said Feller.China has historically concentrated its talent acquisition efforts on scientists of Chinese origin residing overseas and individuals of Chinese descent abroad.Substantial incentives, including housing allowances and welcome bonuses reaching 5 million yuan ($702,200), have successfully attracted Chinese STEM professionals from the United States, particularly as Washington intensifies its scrutiny of China-linked activities.""The recruitment effort targeting Indian tech talent in China is growing but remains moderate compared to the more intensive, well-established, and well-funded initiatives aimed at repatriating Chinese STEM talent,"" said Sichuan University's Das.A Chinese STEM graduate, who recently received employment offers from Silicon Valley, expressed doubts about the K visa programme's effectiveness.""Asian countries like China don't rely on immigration and local Chinese governments have many ways to attract domestic talent,"" he told Reuters.The United States hosts 51 million immigrants, comprising 15% of its population, whilst China accommodates merely 1 million foreigners, representing less than 1% of its residents.Whilst China is not expected to implement substantial changes to its immigration policies to accommodate millions of foreign workers, experts suggest the K visa could enhance Beijing's position in its technological competition with the US.""If China can attract even a sliver of global tech talent, it will be more competitive in cutting-edge technology,"" Feller said.","The newly introduced K visa, announced in August, aims to attract young international STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) graduates.

US economy tracker: Consumer confidence falls in September; inflation and weak job market weigh,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-economy-tracker-consumer-confidence-falls-in-september-inflation-and-weak-job-market-weigh/articleshow/124238464.cms,"



US consumer confidence fell sharply in September as Americans’ concerns over inflation and a weakening job market deepened, according to the Conference Board’s latest survey. The consumer confidence index dropped 3.6 points to 94.2, down from August’s 97.8, marking the lowest reading since April, when President Donald Trump implemented sweeping tariff policies.The index measuring Americans’ short-term expectations for income, business conditions, and employment fell to 73.4, well below the 80 threshold that often signals recession risks, AP reported. Meanwhile, consumers’ evaluation of current economic conditions declined by 7 points to 125.4. Survey respondents cited prices and inflation as their top concern about the economy, regaining the leading position, while mentions of tariffs declined slightly but remained elevated.Government data earlier this month showed inflation rising in August, driven by higher costs for gasoline, groceries, and airfares. Consumer prices increased 2.9% year-on-year, up from 2.7% in July, marking the largest rise since January.Core inflation, excluding food and energy, remained steady at 3.1%.Although unemployment and layoffs remain historically low, the labour market has shown signs of strain this year. The US added just 22,000 nonfarm jobs in August, following a disappointing 79,000 gain in July. Revisions to May and June trimmed a combined 258,000 jobs from prior estimates. The unemployment rate stands at 4.3%, the highest since October 2021.Job openings in August held steady at 7.2 million, according to the Labor Department. Economists note that the slowdown reflects not only the lingering effects of 11 Fed interest rate hikes in 2022 and 2023 but also the impact of Trump-era policies, including tariffs on imports, stricter immigration rules, and federal workforce reductions.Companies remain cautious in hiring, often adopting a “no hire, no fire” approach until the effects of tariffs become clearer. Analysts are now turning attention to Friday’s release of September jobs data, which is expected to show a modest 50,000 job gain.","The Conference Board's consumer confidence index dropped 3.6 points to 94.2, down from August’s 97.8.

US equities edged cautiously on Tuesday as Wall Street approached the end of another strong month, with investors balancing optimism over corporate earnings against economic uncertainty and the potential for a government shutdown.The S&P 500 slipped 0.2% in early trading, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 27 points, or 0.1%. The Nasdaq composite was down 0.2%, yet all three indexes remain positioned for a fifth consecutive monthly gain after last week’s record highs, AP reported.Energy stocks led declines as crude prices remained under pressure. Halliburton shares fell 2%, adding to the week’s losses in the oil sector. Technology gains provided some counterweight, with CoreWeave climbing 15.6% after confirming a $14.2 billion contract with Meta Platforms for cloud computing services under an existing agreement, highlighting continued strong demand for digital infrastructure.Investors are closely monitoring two key reports due later in the day. The first will provide a snapshot of US consumer confidence amid a slower job market and persistent inflation. The second, detailing job openings at the end of August, is expected to provide clues on labour market strength and its impact on the Federal Reserve’s policy trajectory. Analysts are hoping for balanced data—neither too strong to restrain rate cuts nor too weak to raise recession fears.The Fed delivered its first rate reduction of the year earlier this month and signalled more cuts may follow before year-end 2026. Policymakers aim to support the job market after months of steady rates, yet stronger-than-expected labour data could limit the central bank’s flexibility, while weaker readings could exacerbate recession concerns. Markets, already stretched by record valuations since April lows, remain sensitive to such developments.Adding to investor caution is the looming possibility of a US government shutdown. Political deadlock in Washington could halt funding at the end of the day, potentially delaying the release of key economic data, including Friday’s monthly jobs report. The Department of Labor has warned that the Bureau of Labor Statistics would cease operations entirely during a shutdown, raising concerns over data disruptions for market participants.On the corporate front, Vail Resorts slipped 4.6% after posting a larger quarterly loss than expected and signalling limited ski pass sales growth for the upcoming season. Lamb Weston, a major supplier of frozen potato products, jumped 6.3% after reporting better-than-expected quarterly profits, reflecting robust demand.Global markets were mixed, with European and Asian indices moving modestly as investors digested economic signals and geopolitical developments. In the bond market, the 10-year US Treasury yield eased to 4.12% from 4.15% late Monday, reflecting cautious sentiment amid ongoing uncertainty.","The S&P 500 slipped 0.2% in early trading, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 27 points, or 0.1%.

AGOA's impact on African economies



US-Africa trade relations



New partnerships, new opportunities for Africa







The trade agreement between the United States and sub-Saharan African nations, known as AGOA (African Growth and Opportunity Act), is set to expire on September 30.Though some are still hopeful for a last-ditch effort to clinch a follow-up agreement, dozens of African countries are preparing to see the end of 25 years of duty-free access to the US market, at least for now.""Studies show that AGOA has had positive effects. Exports to the US have increased, for example, in the textile industry,"" says Zoryana Olekseyuk, who researches the transformation of economic and social systems at the German Institute of Development and Sustainability (IDOS).""For example, Lesotho could lose almost 6% of total exports, Madagascar over 3%, Botswana and Chad around 2%,"" Olekseyuk told DW.She stressed, however, that all things considered, the success rate of AGOA is a bit of a mixed bag, highlighting that ""the overall effect for the region is limited and the impact varies from country to country and from sector to sector.""Launched in 2000 under US President Bill Clinton, the AGOA trade partnership was intended to bring Africa closer to the world's strongest economy.However, Donald Trump 's return to the White House in 2025, which brought renewed protectionist policies, saw tariffs go up once more, effectively undoing the deal.A total of 35 African countries were part of the agreement, which alleviated access to the American market. Almost 7,000 products could be transported across the Atlantic duty-free under the deal.The trade deal helped entire sectors to develop and flourish, textiles, agriculture and raw materials are some of the top industries that have benefited from the agreement over the years.This in turn resulted in massive job creation, particularly in Madagascar, Lesotho and South Africa.But now, a quarter century of achievements and growth might be lost overnight.Malick Sane, a specialist in international trade at Cheikh Anta Diop University in Dakar, told DW that African companies ""will have great difficulty in continuing to penetrate the American market with competitive products,"" leading to a decline in production output, and therefore jobs.South Africa, the largest African exporter to the United States, faces a projected loss of more than 35,000 jobs in the citrus fruit sector alone, while Madagascar will have to pay a 47% tax on vanilla and textile exports in the future.The US government, meanwhile threatened Lesotho, which relies heavily on the production of jeans materials, with a record tariff of 50%, which was reduced to 15% in July.Mauritius is to pay 40% on its industrial products. Some of these raw materials are essential for the American industry.US tariffs will also be levied on exports of platinum, gold, diamonds and rare earths, important sources of income for numerous countries such as South Africa, Ghana, Lesotho, Namibia and Madagascar.Africa's trade with the US had already been on the decline in recent years, emphasises economist Olekseyuk. ""In 2017, only 8.5% of exports from AGOA countries went to the US. That is significantly less than to Europe or China,"" she stressed, lending hope for a soft landing once the trade agreement expires.Furthermore, she adds that only a few African exporters have actually benefited from AGOA advantages, highlighting that profit margins ""are simply not big enough.""She adds that for the countries that were part of AGOA, the bureaucracy involved in trading with the US often was barely worth the efforts to begin with.In view of these ongoing economic developments, some countries may therefore not even wish to continue with AGOA, while others might seek their own direct deals with the US.Zimbabwe, for instance, decided to lift its own customs barriers to calm the situation, while South Africa and Madagascar continue to seek targeted exemptions from the US.Malian economist Etienne Fakaba Sissoko regards the end of AGOA as an opportunity for a new beginning, as other trading partners continue to gain importance across the continent.""The [Arican] countries should use this historic opportunity to free themselves from their dependency. For 25 years, AGOA has been presented as a gift. In reality, it has mainly served the geographical interests of the United States,"" he told DW.Fakaba Sissoko adds that the end of AGOA ""must be taken as an opportunity to move from a logic of aid to a logic of autonomy for our states.""""We need to build an African economic sovereignty that is no longer dependent on the whims of Washington or any other country.""Olekseyuk agrees, stressing that ""AGOA was important, but has lost its appeal.""""Its demise shows once again that Africa urgently needs to diversify its trade structures.""The African Union (AU) has long been pushing to advance the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA), which has been in force since 2021, to strengthen the continent's economic independence.The free trade area, which comprises 54 African countries with a population of around 1.5 billion people, could now become more attractive for companies across the continent than AGOA ever was, according to the trade expert Sane.However, another trend is emerging at the same time: African trade partnerships with other regions are also redefining the way that Africa's trade of tomorrow might look.China, which recently abolished its tariffs for 33 African countries, is particularly making a name for itself as a substitute partner.In 2024, African exports to the US under AGOA reached a value of $8 billion (€7.6 billion), nearly half of which was South African trade; the same year, trade between China and Africa grew by 4.8% to $295 billion, according to figures published by Chinese customs.Alongside China, the European Union will also remain an important partner for African economies via the Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA).Other countries such as India, Turkey, Brazil and Russia are also trying to strengthen their presence on the continent.For Mamady Kamara, a consultant for governance, development policy and entrepreneurship based in Washington DC, there is no question that Africa must further diversify its partnerships.However, Kamara also warns against replacing old dependencies with new ones: ""The challenge for Africa is to negotiate balanced agreements that actually promote local value creation,"" he told DW.","The AGOA trade agreement between the United States and sub-Saharan African nations is set to expire on September 30. Dozens of African countries are preparing to see the end of 25 years of duty-free access to the US market, at least for now.

US President Donald Trump continued his series of tariffs on Monday (local time), with the latest move impacting lumber and home renovation products from October 14.The White House said a 10% global tariff will be applied to softwood lumber imports.At the same time, upholstered furniture will face a 25% global tariff, rising to 30% on January 1, while kitchen cabinets and vanities will be hit hardest, with a 25% tariff climbing to 50% from the same time.Certain countries, including the United Kingdom, the European Union and Japan, will benefit from more favourable rates, reflecting the terms of their trade agreements with the US.The new tariffs have sparked criticism both inside and outside the United States, drawing complaints from small business owners and members of Congress.Legal challenges are ongoing, with the US Supreme Court set to hear arguments over the tariffs’ legality on November 5.In a fact sheet released alongside the announcement, the administration defended the measures as necessary for national security. It said, “Lumber plays a vital role in civilian construction and military infrastructure.”“Foreign supply chains and major exporters increasingly fill US demand, creating vulnerabilities to disruptions,” it further added, as cited by AFP.The fact sheet added that countries negotiating with the US “may be able to secure an alternative to the pending tariff increases.”","US President Donald Trump continued his series of tariffs on Monday.

The IMF on Tuesday began formal discussions with Pakistan’s economic officials to review the implementation of a $7 billion loan and a $1.1 billion Resilience and Sustainability Facility (RSF).The review comes as Pakistan’s performance under the programme up to June 2025 has been uneven, Dawn reported according to news agency PTI.Although the power sector targets for the end of June 2025 were achieved, revenue collection lagged by around Rs 1.2 trillion, nearly 1% of GDP, in the last fiscal year, with the first two months of the current year showing similar shortfalls.The IMF (International Monetary Fund) mission held its opening meeting on Monday with finance minister Muhammad Aurangzeb and a delegation that included the state bank governor, finance secretary, and federal board of revenue chairman.The delegation will be staying in Pakistan for nearly two weeks, during which they will review the progress of the $7 billion Extended Financing Facility (EFF) and the $1.1 billion RSF. Officials from both sides are expected to discuss corrective measures to meet the upcoming biannual targets, ending in December 2025.Pakistan is also seeking IMF support to accelerate the long-delayed brownfield petroleum refinery policy.The stalled upgrades have held back around $6 billion in fresh investment for upgrading refineries.Officials argue that the move is in line with the RSF’s goals, as the upgrades would allow production of petroleum products that meet European standards with lower carbon and sulphur emissions.The IMF mission will also hold forward-looking talks with authorities to push for faster implementation of the remaining targets, the report added.","IMF to review implementation of a $7 billion loan and a $1.1 billion Resilience and Sustainability Facility.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground.Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change, too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume.

Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain and boost vendor partnerships ahead of a stock market debut planned for 2025.The Series E round was done via a combination of fresh equity and conversion of debt, the Bangalore-based company said in a statement Thursday. The round was led by M&G Plc and existing investors including Lightspeed Venture Partners and DST Global participated.The round “fully funds our business plan,” Vaibhav Gupta, Udaan co-founder and chief executive officer, said in the statement. “It enables our continued journey of growth and profitability, positioning us well to be public-market ready in the next 12-18 months.”Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, runs an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business, though a very small part of India’s overall retail market, is expected to swell to $150 billion in sales in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co.The startup targets an initial public offering in 2025, though it’s yet to decide whether it will do so in India or overseas, Gupta told Bloomberg News last month.Udaan was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran the company until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021.

Seven trillion USD economy size by 2030 is possible if India maintains its present growth trajectory, and in that journey startup entrepreneurs are going to play an important role,"" he is quoted as having said in the release.He was of the view that the active participation of startups in India in developing business models on the foundation of expanding physical and digital infrastructure will continue to generate efficiency, revenue and economic returns for the country.""The last decade has seen an exceptional transformation in the startup landscape in India, which has emerged as the third largest ecosystem globally, with over 1.12 lakh startups presently recognised by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) across 763 districts.""Among them, more than 110 are unicorns with a total valuation of around USD 350 billion,"" he said.The CEA further said that the country ranks second in innovation quality.He said that innovation in India was not just limited to certain sectors as startups were solving problems in 56 industrial sectors, with 13 per cent of them from IT services, nine per cent from health and life sciences, seven per cent from education, five per cent from agriculture and five per cent from food and beverages.Nageswaran also said it was significant that 49 per cent of the startups were from tier-2 and 3 cities which have turned to be game-changers as the business advantages in these locations enable entrepreneurs to operate at lower costs as compared to tier-1 cities.""Apart from improved infrastructure and the government's pro-active policies, the availability of a technically skilled talent pool is a huge advantage for startups to set up and flourish in tier-2 and tier-3 cities,"" he said.He said that historically there was a perception that small towns were difficult places to conduct business.""...but with improved internet penetration, vastly better physical infrastructure, road, rail and air connectivity and supportive government policies, this is no longer true,"" he said.He also noted Kerala's startup journey has been an inspiring one.The CEA said that KSUM has served as the catalyst since its establishment in 2006 to promote change that propelled the state into the forefront of the global startup arena.KSUM is the Kerala government's nodal agency established in 2006 for entrepreneurship development and incubation activities in the state.Nageswaran said that with over 4,000 registered tech startups, 63 incubators and 10 lakh square feet of incubation space, KSUM has not only met its goal of promoting technology-based entrepreneurship but has also earned the distinguished position of being among the world's top business incubators.The November 16-18 fifth edition of Huddle Global, India's biggest beachside startup conclave, was organised by KSUM at Adimalathura beach, near Vizhinjam, here.Attended by around 1,500 delegates, the event displayed sophisticated products from emerging sectors such as robotics, Artificial Intelligence , Machine Learning, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, life sciences, space tech, blockchain, IoT, e-governance, fintech, healthtech, agritech, edutech and SaaS from across the country.","Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran said tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country.

E-Commerce startup Udaan to trim costs ahead of 2025 IPO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/e-commerce-startup-udaan-to-trim-costs-ahead-of-2025-ipo/articleshow/105001132.cms,"E-commerce startup Udaan is working to curb costs and forge new partnerships with consumer brands in India as it prepares to go public in 2025.Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta said in an interview. That’s set to happen around the same time as its initial public offering, he said.The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said. “Second, strategically we want to ensure that we are top of mind with shopkeepers, with big manufacturers, and we maintain our relative market share.”Lightspeed Venture Partners-backed Udaan is among startups trying to tap the rapid growth of India’s economy and consumer market, while meeting investor demands for profitability. Udaan, which at its peak employed thousands, joined fellow Indian startups in slashing jobs last year and tightening internal controls and compliance. It now has about 1,800 staff, and Gupta didn’t specify if further job cuts are needed.Corporate governance lapses at Indian online tutoring firm Byju’s, once the country’s top startup with a valuation of $22 billion, shone a light at unique challenges faced by founders in the South Asian nation and drove companies to be more diligent.“We continue to move towards more professionalized management, professionalized board and also institutionalized shareholders as we go towards public markets,” Gupta said.Udaan is yet to decide whether it will list in India or overseas. It was valued at more than $3 billion in a 2021 funding round, and was in talks to raise $400 million, Business Standard reported in September. Lightspeed owns about 35% of Udaan, while Tencent Holdings Ltd. holds 6%.The company was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran Udaan until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021. The other two founders — Amod Malviya and Sujeet Kumar — are board members.Udaan built an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business still accounts for a very small part of India’s overall retail market but can balloon to $150 billion in sales and yield a 100% return on capital invested in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co. estimates published in the Mint newspaper.Bengaluru-based Udaan has also ventured into financing through its fintech unit which helps shopkeepers get working capital loans to buy inventory. That business is profitable before taxes and is growing 70% annually, Gupta said.“That’s a second business in the overall umbrella of Udaan trying to organize trade in the country,” Gupta said. “In addition to commerce, financing becomes an important market opportunity.”","Udaan will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta says.

SAR imagery provides much higher resolution than other forms of remote sensing technology such as hyperspectral and multispectral. SAR is a critical technology for strategic reconnaissance and planning as well as for disaster management.According to Misra, winning the challenge in just over a year of floating the company is a major booster.He said L and P band SAR have an advantage over other frequencies (like X band) when it comes to penetration capabilities through rain, clouds, foliage and vegetation in a tropical country like India, and underground penetration capabilities in dry terrain.Continuing further, he said the L band SAR will provide 1 metre resolution, spotlight resolution in Stripmap mode. The current industry standard is 5-10 metre in L band. Misra said both the L and P band will operate simultaneously from a satellite borne SAR.

How India's GDP has been growing

What SBI report said on savings and investment

Incremental capital output ratio

NEW DELHI: India's gross domestic product (GDP) data for the third quarter (October-December 2022) received a word of caution from the former Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Raghuram Rajan In an interview with news agency PTI, Rajan that India is ""dangerously close"" to the Hindu rate of growth in view of subdued private sector investment, high interest rates and slowing global growth.India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%.Rajan termed this sequential slowdown in growth as ""worrying"".However, a report released by the State Bank of India (SBI) economists on Tuesday dismissed arguments that India is dangerously close to Hindu rate of growth saying such statements are ""ill-conceived, biased and premature"".The term 'Hindu growth rate' was coined by late economist Raj Krishna in 1978 to describe the slow growth in the country.It basically refers to the low pace of economic growth rates during 1950s to 1980s. During this period, the Indian economy averaged 3.5%.A former lecturer at the Delhi School of Economics (DSE), Krishna noted that only if the rate of growth is persistently slow and accompanied by low per-capita GDP, then it will be known as Hindu rate of growth but it has to factor in population growth as well.Before economic reforms of 1991, India's economic growth remained stagnant and low, while per capita income averaged around 1.3%.Krishna termed this low growth situation to be a result of socialist policies of state control and import substitution.However, the economic situation changed when liberalisation, privatisation and globalisation (LPG) reforms came into effect in the year 1991, at a time when India faced balance of payment crisis.Over the years, many economists have strongly opposed the idea of 'Hindu growth rate' and the term never had universal acceptance.The Indian economy plunged into its very first technical recession in FY21 due to the impact of Covid-19 pandemic and the related nationwide lockdowns. GDP shrunk by an unprecedented 23.8% in the first quarter of the financial year 2020-21. However, due to spurt in economic activities in the subsequent quarters, the GDP decline started to narrow.However, if we look at the period before Covid-19 as well, India's growth curve shows a declining trend.From 8.26% in FY17, GDP growth plunged to 3.74% in FY20. Shutdown of economic activities in FY21 in wake of Covid-19 only made matters worse.As lockdowns started to ease and business activities resumed, India's GDP also started rising. In Q1 of FY22, growth jumped to 20.1% mainly on account of low base effect. By the fourth quarter of FY22, growth came down to 4.10%.Similarly, the new financial year 2022-23 brought fresh economic challenges in the form of Russia-Ukraine war that impacted almost all major economies of the world, slowed the pace of growth, pushed inflation to record highs.As a result, the central banks of all advanced economies spurred into action and opted for monetary policy tightening to curb the soaring inflation.With persistently rising interest rates, India's economy grew by 4.4% in Q3 of FY23, as the Centre revised upwards GDP growth for previous year to 9.10% from 8.7% earlier.The report weighed recent GDP numbers against the available data on savings and investments for the past decade and highlighted some interesting points.""Quarterly growth numbers are noisy and should be best avoided for any serious interpretation (on an average, India's GDP growth has witnessed Rs 2 lakh crore upward revision for the 3 year ended FY23),"" the report said.Gross capital formation (GCF) by the government touched a high of 11.8% in 2021-22, up from 10.7% in 2020-21.""This also had a domino effect on private sector investment that jumped from 10 per cent to 10.8% over the same period,"" it said.In fact, Ecowrap added that the trends in GCF to gross output ratio or the plough back of funds for creation of fresh capacity shows that for public administration the ratio attained fresh peak in 2021-22 owing to the emphasis on capital expenditure in recent budgets.At the aggregate level, gross capital formation is supposed to have crossed 32% in 2022-23, the highest level since 2018-19.According to the report, in 2021-22, gross savings have risen to 30% from 29% in 2020-21.""The ratio is supposed to have crossed 31 per cent in 2022-23, the highest since 2018-19. The household savings increased sharply during the pandemic period on account of sharp accretion in financial savings such as deposits,"" said the report by SBI's Economic Research Department.While household financial savings have since then moderated from 15.4% in 2020-21 to 11.1% in 2022-23, savings in physical assets have grown sharply to 11.8% in 2021-22 from 10.7% in 2020-21.The report further analysed Incremental Capital Output ratio (ICOR) -- which measures additional units of capital (investment) needed to produce additional units of output. It said that the ratio has been improving.""ICOR which was 7.5 in FY 12 is now only 3.5 in FY22. Clearly, only half of capital is now needed for next unit of output,"" the report noted.Such reducing ICOR in the current years reflects a relatively increasing efficiency of capital and shows that the economy is on a sound footing, the report said.""From that point of view, future GDP growth rates even at 7% could still mean a decent number by any standards!,"" it added.","India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%.

An employee is entitled for a 50 per cent amount of the last drawn salary as pension.OPS was discontinued by the NDA government in 2003 with effect from April 1, 2004.Under the new pension scheme (NPS), employees contribute 10 per cent of their basic salary towards pension while the government contributes 14 per cent.Governments of Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand have informed the central government/ Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA about their decision to restart OPS for their employees.The government of Punjab on November 18, 2022, issued a notification regarding implementation of OPS for the state government employees who are being covered under NPS. Jharkhand too has decided to revert to OPS.",Former RBI governor Raghuram Rajan has expressed his concern over the decision of some states to restart the old pension scheme.

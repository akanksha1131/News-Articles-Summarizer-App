Stock market recommendations:Nifty after a strong rally of 1900 points in just 15 sessions has entered a phase of sideways consolidation over the last 3 sessions, amid being in an overbought zone. The index tested the resistance level around 23,800 on Tuesday’s session, where it faced resistance, coinciding with the high from February 2025.Going ahead, we expect the index to consolidate in the range of 23,800-23,200 thus working off the overbought condition developed in the daily stochastic after the recent sharp rally. We believe consolidation should be considered as healthy retracement making a higher base, which will eventually pave way for further upside towards 24,100-24,200 levels in the coming weeks being the confluence of high of January 2025 and 50% retracement of the entire decline (26277-21965).On the downside, 23,200-23,000 would act as strong support being the confluence of the recent breakout area and 50 days EMA. Investors should focus on accumulating quality stocks with a medium-term perspective.Structurally, the current pullback of 1,900 points is the largest since the all-time high of September 2024, suggesting that rallies are becoming more extended. In the process the Nifty witnessed a faster pace of up-move where it regained previous 18 days of fall (23,807-21,965) in just 14 trading sessions, indicating structural turnaround backed by improvement in breadth as well as sentiment indicator. Any pullback from here should be capitalized as a buying opportunity, wherein volatility will prevail, amid upcoming result season and tariff related clarity from Trump.Bank Nifty in the last 3 sessions is seen consolidating in a range after a a rally of 4200 points (47,800-52,000) in just 9 sessions.Going ahead, we expect the index to consolidate in the range of 52,000-50,500 thus forming a base for the next leg of up move and in the process work off the overbought condition developed in the daily stochastic.We believe the current breather should be used to accumulate quality banking stocks as we expect the index to sustain above the recent 10 weeks range breakout area (50,500-48,000) and gradually head towards 53,000 levels in coming weeks being the measuring implication of the last 10 weeks range breakout.","According to Bajaj Broking Research, Larsen and Toubro and Indian Energy Exchange are the top stock picks for today.

Macquarie has initiated its coverage of Trent with an ‘outperform’ rating and a target price of Rs 7,000. Analysts said that company was India's leading fashion retailer in the value to mid-premium space. Trent also leads Asian peers on growth, return profile and inventory turns. They see this sustaining as an integrated back-end allowing quicker fashion-forward style drops and part new stores. The company has best retailing metrics among Asian peers and it’s a play on India's rising discretionary spend in fashion.HSBC has a ‘buy’ call on Adani Ports & SEZ with a target price of Rs 1,600. Analysts said Adani Ports reiterated its EBITDA guidance of Rs 18,800-18,900 crore for FY25. The company emphasised its ambition to become an integrated end-to-end logistics services provider. They view the company as a long-term proxy for India’s trade and infrastructure growth.CLSA has an ‘outperform’ call on L&T with a target price of Rs 4,151. Analysts said that company won its biggest ever EPC contract recently, valued at over $4 billion for an offshore gas project from Qatarenergy LNG. This adds to its over backlog by 6.6%. This contract clearly takes L&T into the big leagues of global EPC, capable of handling multi-billion dollar contracts.JPMorgan has an ‘overweight’ call on HAL with a target price of Rs 4,958. Analysts said GE Aerospace has started delivery of F404-IN20 engines for LCA MK1A fighter aircrafts to HAL. This delayed delivery of engines has been an overhang on HAL. So now with the delivery starting, overhang has been lifted. The company continues to have a large opportunity set and enjoys almost a monopoly status.Goldman Sachs has raised the end-2025 gold price forecast to $3,300-per ounce from $3,100 earlier.

Customs duty reduction an ongoing exercise: FM,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/customs-duty-reduction-an-ongoing-exercise-fm/articleshow/119614192.cms,"NEW DELHI: Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Thursday dismissed charges that govt was reducing customs duty under pressure from the Trump administration, arguing that it was in line with the Centre’s policy.“This is a consistent thing. I heard quite a few members saying that in response to the tariff war announced by president Trump we are doing this. No, we have been doing it since 2023. Steadily, every year more items are being brought in, keeping in mind Atma Nirbhar Bharat (commitment) at the same time Viksit Bharat ’s requirements as much as simplifying customs duty and compliance… It has nothing to do with today’s global situation but a process that will continue in future,” FM said, while replying to the discussion on the Finance Bill in Rajya Sabha.Several opposition MPs, including former FM P Chidambaram had alleged that govt had made tax changes under pressure from the US. In the budget, govt had lowered levies on high end bikes and batteries and their inputs, among several things, while also rationalising the number of customs slabs.After a voice vote, the Upper House returned the Finance Bill 2025 to the Lok Sabha, along with 35 amendments and thereby completing the 2025-26 budgetary exercise. The House also returned the Appropriation Bill (3) with a voice vote.On concerns related to the Validation of the Central Civil Services (Pension) Rules and Principles for Expenditure on Pension Liabilities, FM said that they do not in any way alter the existing pensions of existing civil pensioners from the present stage. Defence pensioners are also not affected in any way as they are covered by separate rules.While reiterating govt’s commitment to adhering to the fiscal glide path, Sitharaman said that instead of being cautious about revenue, the govt reduced the income tax and tariffs, which will go a long way in making India a manufacturing hub. “Tendency of the finance ministry is to exercise caution and not let go of revenues but, here we wanted to use this opportunity to show our respect for the Indian taxpayer,” Sitharaman said.","Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman dismissed charges that govt was reducing customs duty under pressure from the Trump administration.

In 7 charts: How India's GDP has doubled from $2.1 trillion to $4.2 trillion in just 10 years,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/in-7-charts-how-indias-gdp-has-doubled-from-2-1-trillion-to-4-2-trillion-in-just-10-years/articleshow/119545395.cms,"<p>India’s economic growth has come despite a major economic setback in the form of the Covid pandemic a few years ago. (AI image)<br></p>

As India looks set to become the world’s fourth largest economy next year, and the third largest in the later part of this decade, we take a look at 7 charts that show the incredible growth story of India and ask experts about what led to the 100% rise in GDP:

India’s Rise in numbers

India’s nominal GDP in 2015 was $2,103.6 billion. Come 2025, the IMF projects that it will reach $4,271.9 billion. That's over 100% growth in just 10 years!

Among the top 10 largest world economies, India has exhibited the highest growth in GDP. Three out of the present top 4 world economies have seen a decent GDP growth in 10 years; 65.8% for the US, 75.8% for China and 43.7% for Germany. Japan’s economy has contracted 1.3% in the last 10 years, as per IMF’s October 2024 World Economic Outlook.

Back in 2014, India was the world’s 10th largest economy in terms of nominal GDP. From there, it has risen through the ranks to become the world’s 5th largest economy - a feat it achieved in 2021.

A recent SBI Research report notes that with the government's efforts to ensure quality of life for all citizens and stopped leakage of benefits through Direct Benefit Transfer, the per capita GDP at current prices stood at Rs 2.35 lakh in FY25, with decadal CAGR growth of 9.1%. “In constant prices too, per capita GDP has increased to Rs 1.33 lakh in FY25. In the last two fiscals, the per capita GDP jumped by more than Rs 40,000 at current prices,” says the SBI Research report.

When will India become the world's 3rd largest economy?

India’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) has doubled in the last 10 years - a huge feat for an economy that is also set to become the world’s third largest in a few years. India’s economic growth has come despite a major economic setback in the form of the Covid pandemic a few years ago.According to latest International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) data, India’s GDP under the Narendra Modi government has seen 103.1% growth in GDP at current prices or nominal GDP. It has also gone from being the world’s 10th largest economy to the fifth largest.How has India managed to double its GDP in just ten years? What factors have worked to propel the economy, which at one time had been infamously ranked among the ‘Fragile Five’?Suggesting strong economic fundamentals, India will continue to be the fastest growing major economy in the coming years as well, says IMF. It has projected that India’s GDP will grow at 6.5% in both FY 2025 and FY 2026.All other top 10 world economies will grow at much lower rates - with China projected to see the second highest GDP growth rate of 4.5%.With a healthy GDP growth rate, the Indian economy is expected to surpass Japan in 2026 as the world’s 4th largest economy. It is likely to become the third largest economy in the world in nominal GDP terms by 2028, according to IMF projections.India’s GDP is expected to rise to $5723.3 billion by 2028 and $6307.2 billion by 2029. In 2029, the world’s largest economy, the US, is projected to have a GDP of $35458 billion - which is 5.62 times India’s GDP!In the interactive chart above, we take a look at India's rise from 2015 to 2029 (projected). The GDP data for US and China is not highlighted since they will continue to the top two world economies through these years.Economists credit the government policies and reforms with focus on manufacturing sector, exports, digitalization, GST and capital expenditure push for the infrastructure sector as major reasons for the astounding rise in nominal GDP numbers.Madan Sabnavis, chief economist at Bank of Baroda says a number of factors have come together to enable this rather remarkable growth in the Indian economy:Agriculture has been very resilient in this decade notwithstanding erratic climatic conditions. This is something which has kept output ticking as well as rural incomes stable.India Inc has delivered quite well over the years in terms of expansion of business, investment, employment and diversification. This has created a very strong industrial sector. Several industries are a part of global supply chains.The government has provided a very facilitative framework for business through a plethora of policies like Make in India, PLI, tax regime, MSME loans etc, he tells TOI.a. At the same time the upliftment for the lower segments through direct measures has elevated standard of living as comes out from the consumption survey data.b. The widespread use of technology though the digitization process has cut down on cost and ensured transparency in dealings.c. GST has been a major breakthrough which has improved transparency.d. The fiscal deficit has been brought under control with the focus being on prudence which has allowed the government to spend more on capex.Also Read | Trump tariffs impact: Is a US recession likely and does India need to worry about it? The services sector has been a major driver of the economy.a. The service export component has been a major driver of growth.b. The logistics and retail segments have seen exponential growth with demand being robust.The RBI has brought about a sea change in different areas.a. Made the banking system resilient and robust by leaning up balance sheets of banks.b. Brought in pro-active regulation to ensure stability of the system.c. Monetary policy streamlined on global standards with MPC to fight inflation.The large flow of FDI has supplemented domestic capital and enhanced investment in the country.The capital market has enabled raising of both equity and debt which is required for financing investment in the country. Here the regulator SEBI has been proactive all through to ensure there are no mis-steps.“Therefore, the story is one of pragmatic polices, prudent regulation, successful business entrepreneurship which has moulded well in the process of globalization,” he tells TOI.Also Read | Why Jim Walker, man who foresaw 2008 market crash, wants investors to ‘absolutely double down’ on Indian equities According to Dharmakirti Joshi, Chief Economist at Crisil, “The government's emphasis on infrastructure development has contributed to higher-than-expected GDP growth following the pandemic. The introduction of GST enhanced tax compliance and increased government revenues, enabling greater budgetary spending on infrastructure.”DK Joshi also believes that the rapid advancements in digital infrastructure have facilitated efficient payment systems, quicker credit delivery, and fostered innovation. “The healthy balance sheets of banks have also supported faster credit growth,” he tells TOI.Radhika Rao, Senior Economist at DBS Bank notes that in the past decade, there has been a strong focus towards higher capital expenditure from the government as well as households, with the latter reflected in rising contribution to real estate and construction.She credits the successive budgets that have seen a sharp increase in capex outlays, which has positive multipliers for the economy while the stickier revenue expenditure has been gradually rationalised.“Concurrently, the composition of external trade has also undergone a change with rising share of manufactured goods in exports and strong gains in services, led by the contribution of global capability centres. These have not only helped make the net export balance less negative but have also helped to improve the health of the current account balance,” she tells TOI.Also Read | Donald Trump's tariffs: India may be among least vulnerable Asian economies in trade war with US - but there's a catch! India’s real GDP growth rate was 9.2% for 2023-24 - which is the highest in the previous 12 years except FY22 growth (9.7%, which is highest since independence). The economy has recovered well from the GDP growth slowdown of Q2 FY2025, with a 6.2% growth in the third quarter.India looks set to rank among the top three economies in the coming years. But in a world of increasing economic uncertainties, and the threat of US tariffs looming, it will have to proactively manage its fiscal and monetary policies to stay on the high growth path.","India’s GDP under the Narendra Modi government has seen 103.1% growth in GDP at current prices or nominal GDP.

India has decided to discontinue parts of its gold monetisation scheme, which had encouraged households and institutions to deposit idle gold in exchange for interest payments.

Adding to this, a close below its previous day’s low was also seen yesterday confirming price pressure at higher levels leading to a pause in momentum. Charts suggest a move towards 24000+ wherein it could retest its 200 DMA on the upside, a strong shakeout in the derivative data suggests a wild 400-500 pt swing in the next 2-4 trading sessions.

Intermediate targets have been met at 51650 while overall target continues to show bias towards the 52500 zone. A case of retesting its 200 DMA remains open wherein the index could initially take support at sub 51000 levels before inching higher as Bank Nifty looks more stretched compared to Nifty. However, outperformance of the same is likely to continue against Nifty.A 3 month trendline breakout has been seen on charts of AFFLE, this is in sync with a breakout from its 200 DMA resistance near 1540.

The US economy expanded at a healthy annual rate of 2.4% in the final quarter of 2024, according to a slight upgrade in the government’s growth estimate released on Thursday.The growth was driven by a strong year-end surge in consumer spending , despite challenges posed by a slowdown in business investment and declining inventories.The increase in Gross Domestic Product (GDP) was down from a 3.1% pace in the third quarter, signalling a deceleration in growth. The overall 2024 economy grew by 2.8%, slightly down from 2.9% in 2023, news agency AP reported.Consumer spending was a key driver, growing at a 4% pace in the fourth quarter, up from 3.7% in the third quarter. However, business investment fell, with a notable 8.7% drop in investment in equipment. A decline in business inventories contributed to a 0.84 percentage point reduction in GDP growth for the quarter.A key measure of the economy's underlying strength, which excludes volatile components such as exports, inventories, and government spending, showed a healthy 2.9% annual growth rate in Q4, slightly revised down from the previous estimate of 3.2%. This was also lower than the 3.4% pace recorded in Q3.While consumer spending provided a boost, inflationary pressures continued to rise toward the end of 2024. The Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation gauge, the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, rose at an annual rate of 2.4%, up from 1.5% in the third quarter and exceeding the Fed's 2% target. Core PCE inflation , which excludes volatile food and energy prices, registered 2.6%, up from 2.2% in the prior quarter.Despite the strong finish to 2024, the outlook for 2025 remains uncertain, particularly with the trade policies of President Donald Trump . His decision to impose new tariffs — including a 25% tax on imported cars — could lead to higher inflation and disrupt business investment, threatening future growth.The fourth-quarter GDP data reflects the economy before the surge in policy uncertainty and trade tensions escalated, particularly under Trump’s administration. As Ryan Sweet, Chief US Economist at Oxford Economics, noted, ""The combination of policy uncertainty, tariffs, and tightening financial market conditions are weighing on growth early this year.""In addition to trade concerns, US consumer confidence has dropped sharply, driven by fears of inflation and the impact of tariffs. Major retailers have adjusted their expectations for 2025, with some warning that consumers are already curbing their spending. As the year progresses, the economic landscape could face additional challenges from both domestic and international pressures.","US economy expanded at a healthy annual rate of 2.4% in the final quarter of 2024.

US stock market experienced mixed movements on Thursday as President Donald Trump 's latest tariff announcement on imported cars weighed down automakers, while positive economic data provided some support for the market.The S&P 500 showed little movement in the morning, recovering from an earlier dip. As of 10 a.m. Eastern time, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down by 33 points, or 0.1%, and the Nasdaq Composite was also lower by 0.1%, according to news agency AP.General Motors led the losses, plunging 5.9% after Trump revealed a 25% tariff on imported vehicles. Ford Motor followed suit, dropping 2.1%. Even US automakers felt the impact of the tariffs due to their extensive supply chains across North America. President Trump has emphasized the desire for auto production to take place within the US to reduce dependency on imports.“There are still many unknowns, but if these tariffs stay in place, the companies will certainly face challenges,” said Joseph Spak, an analyst at UBS.Complicating matters, the US government faces the challenge of determining how to apply tariffs to parts made under the North American free trade agreement but not in the US Tracking such parts could prove difficult, Spak noted.Automakers outside the US were also hit. Honda Motor fell 2.5% in Tokyo, while Toyota Motor dropped 2%, and Hyundai Motor in Seoul fell 4.3%.Electric vehicle makers, such as Tesla and Rivian, performed better. Both companies, with more production in the US, are less affected by the new tariffs. Tesla rose 2.7%, and Rivian gained 3.1%.There is growing uncertainty about the impact of Trump’s upcoming “Liberation Day” tariffs, set for April 2, when he plans to introduce reciprocal tariffs on the US’s trading partners, matching the trade burdens they impose on the US Many are hopeful that Trump might opt for more targeted or less severe tariffs, which could lessen the global economic pain. However, the constant talk of tariffs has already raised concerns, making both US consumers and businesses more cautious.Despite the tariff concerns, recent economic reports have been more encouraging. A new report revealed that fewer workers applied for unemployment benefits than expected, signalling a strong job market. Additionally, a second report indicated that US economic growth in the final quarter of 2024 was stronger than initially thought.These positive economic reports helped keep Treasury yields steady, with the yield on the 10-year Treasury bond edging up to 4.36% from 4.35% the previous day.Among individual stocks, Petco Health & Wellness saw a major gain of 33.4%, after reporting better-than-expected results for its most recent quarter.Overseas, European stock indexes fell, following the declines in automakers' shares. Japan's Nikkei 225 dropped 0.6%, while Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba called for tariff exemptions on Japan. In contrast, stocks in China rose slightly, with Shanghai up by 0.1% and Hong Kong gaining 0.4%.Chinese automakers have been expanding internationally, but have not yet made significant inroads into the US market, so the tariffs' impact on them would be indirect.","The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down by 33 points, or 0.1%, as of 10 a.m. Eastern time.

China's Richest Reshuffle

About Zhang Yiming

TikTok owner ByteDance Ltd. 's founder Zhang Yiming has emerged as the wealthiest individual in China, marking his first ascent to this position. On Wednesday, Zhang claimed the top spot by overtaking Zhong Shanshan, known for his bottled water enterprise, and Tencent Holdings' co-founder Ma Huateng, with his wealth valued at $57.5 billion, according to a Bloomberg report.This achievement is particularly noteworthy for the 41-year-old, considering the recent challenges, including potential US restrictions on TikTok, ByteDance's popular application, and a temporary withdrawal of music content from the platform by the world's largest record label.Following a decline in Nongfu Spring Co.'s earnings that affected Zhong's wealth, Zhang secured the premier position. In the Asian wealth hierarchy, he now stands third, following Indian industrialists Mukesh Ambani and Gautam Adani, as per the Bloomberg Billionaires Index .Zhang's net worth increased by over $10 billion after Bloomberg's analysis of valuations from institutional investors BlackRock Inc., Fidelity Investments and T. Rowe Price Group Inc., alongside ByteDance's intention to repurchase employee shares at a $312 billion valuation. The four valuations averaged $365 billion.Also Read | Mukesh Ambani drops out of world’s top 10 richest persons list, retains Asia’s wealthiest person tag - check list The status of TikTok's operations in the United States remains uncertain. US President Donald Trump extended the deadline by 75 days - until April 5 - for ByteDance to secure a purchaser for its US operations or risk prohibition.According to Bloomberg News, Oracle Corp. is considering a proposal to acquire TikTok's US operations that would involve providing security guarantees and acquiring a minor stake in a new US entity, whilst potentially allowing the application's crucial algorithm to remain under Chinese control.On Wednesday, Trump indicated his willingness to consider reducing tariffs on China to obtain Beijing's backing for the sale of TikTok's US operations to an American organisation. He expressed confidence in securing at least a preliminary agreement for TikTok by the following week but stated that if a deal remained incomplete, he would pursue a deadline extension.ByteDance maintains a prominent position in China's artificial intelligence sector.

Trump LIVE: ‘You Hang On There…’: US President Gets Upset During Big Announcement | Watch

Why it matters

Tesla manufactures all of the vehicles it sells in the US domestically — primarily at its Fremont, California, and Austin, Texas, plants. That gives the company a major advantage over rivals like GM, Ford, and international brands such as Hyundai, Toyota, and Volkswagen, which rely heavily on imports or cross-border supply chains.

But while Tesla’s final assembly happens on US soil, many parts used in its vehicles come from overseas. That includes everything from electric motors to lithium-ion battery cells and raw materials that are essential for EV production. Those components will now be taxed, raising Tesla’s production costs and, potentially, sticker prices.

The tariffs arrive at a time when Tesla is already grappling with declining market share and rising competition. Musk has warned investors that the company’s growth rate may slow this year. Higher production costs due to tariffs could make it harder to compete on price in an increasingly crowded EV market.

Zoom in

Tesla’s Model Y and Model 3 were the top-selling EVs in the US in 2024.

Competitors like GM’s Chevrolet Equinox EV and Ford’s Mustang Mach-E — both built in Mexico — are now facing much steeper cost increases.

Analysts estimate that tariffs could add as much as $6,000 to the price of a vehicle made in Mexico or Canada, and up to $12,000 for some EVs, depending on component sourcing.

Tesla’s stock dipped about 1.3% following Trump’s announcement — less than other automakers, a sign investors see it as relatively insulated.

Despite that insulation, Musk is pushing back against any idea that Tesla will benefit unilaterally. The company’s complex global supply chain, like those of other automakers, remains vulnerable.

The big picture

Between the lines

Trump insists the tariffs will bring jobs and factories back to the US. But even auto executives warn the sudden change could disrupt a finely tuned supply network built over decades. Industry analysts expect a sharp production drop of up to 30% across North America — translating to as many as 20,000 fewer vehicles produced per day.

Jonathan Smoke, chief economist at Cox Automotive, forecast ""virtually all North American vehicle production"" would be disrupted by mid-April. That includes vehicles assembled in the US using imported parts now subject to tariffs. “Lower production, tighter supply, and higher prices are around the corner,” Smoke told the NYT.

Tesla might avoid some of the worst disruption thanks to its US-based final assembly. But Musk’s comments reflect the reality that even Tesla’s vertically integrated model isn’t immune to global pricing pressures.

Raw materials like lithium, cobalt, and nickel — critical to EV battery production — are still largely sourced and processed overseas. In recent years, Tesla has tried to localize more of its supply chain, but shifting mining and refining operations to the US is a long, capital-intensive process.

What they’re saying

As per a Bloomberg report, here is a summary of all important reactions.

President Donald Trump: “What we’re going to be doing is a 25% tariff on all cars that are not made in the United States. We’re going to charge countries for doing business in our country and taking our jobs, taking our wealth, taking a lot of things that they’ve been taking over the years.”

We’re going to charge countries for doing business in our country and taking our jobs, taking our wealth, taking a lot of things that they’ve been taking over the years.” Trump again, on the broader goal: “That’s the real Liberation Day of America, and that’s going to be in April 2, and I look forward to it.”

“That’s the real Liberation Day of America, and that’s going to be in April 2, and I look forward to it.” Jennifer Safavian, president of Autos Drive America: “The tariffs imposed today will make it more expensive to produce and sell cars in the United States, ultimately leading to higher prices, fewer options for consumers and fewer manufacturing jobs in the US.”

“The tariffs imposed today will make it more expensive to produce and sell cars in the United States, ultimately leading to higher prices, fewer options for consumers and fewer manufacturing jobs in the US.” United Auto Workers President Shawn Fain: “Ending the race to the bottom in the auto industry starts with fixing our broken trade deals, and the Trump administration has made history with today’s actions.”

“We’re going to make sure that we inflict as much pain as possible to the American people without inflicting pain on the Canadian population.” European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen: “We will now assess this announcement, together with other measures the US is envisaging in the next days. The EU will continue to seek negotiated solutions, while safeguarding its economic interests.”

“We will now assess this announcement, together with other measures the US is envisaging in the next days. The EU will continue to seek negotiated solutions, while safeguarding its economic interests.” Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney: “The US tariffs are a direct attack on people who work in the auto industry and violate the US-Mexico-Canada trade agreement.”

What’s next

The bottom line

US President Donald Trump on Wednesday signed a sweeping proclamation imposing a 25% tariff on all imported cars, trucks, and key auto parts — a move that could redraw the global auto landscape. While Tesla may be better positioned than many rivals, CEO Elon Musk made it clear his company won’t emerge unscathed.“Important to note that Tesla is NOT unscathed here. The tariff impact on Tesla is still significant,” Musk wrote in a post on X.The new tariffs, which go into effect April 2, will hit not only fully assembled vehicles but also engines, transmissions, electrical systems, and other crucial components sourced from abroad — including from US allies like Mexico and Canada. The Trump administration has signaled the levies are permanent and will not be subject to negotiation.Also read: Donald Trump announces new auto tariffs ahead of April 2 deadline The auto tariffs are part of Trump’s broader trade agenda, aimed at reshaping US manufacturing and reducing reliance on foreign imports. They come on the heels of a similar move targeting imports from Canada and Mexico, which were initially delayed but are now scheduled for full implementation.“What we’re going to be doing is a 25% tariff on all cars that are not made in the United States,” Trump said Wednesday. “We’re going to charge countries for doing business in our country and taking our jobs.”While the White House says cars produced under the USMCA agreement can avoid full tariffs if they meet strict US content thresholds, the process to certify parts and vehicles remains undefined. In the meantime, many vehicles — including those from Detroit’s Big Three — face an immediate financial squeeze.GM, for example, imports key models like the Chevy Trax and Equinox from South Korea and Mexico. Ford builds the entry-level Maverick and Bronco Sport in Mexico. Stellantis (maker of Jeep, Chrysler, Dodge, and Ram) brings in vehicles from Mexico, Canada, and even Italy.Foreign brands face even steeper challenges. Hyundai and Kia imported over a million vehicles to the US last year. Volkswagen, Toyota, Honda, and BMW also rely heavily on international supply chains. Analysts expect new-car prices to rise significantly — in some cases by thousands of dollars — across the board.“There are very few winners,” Sam Fiorani, vice president at AutoForecast Solutions, told Bloomberg. “Consumers will be losers because they will have reduced choice and higher prices.”The US government is expected to begin enforcing tariffs on imported vehicles and components starting April 2. Duties on specific auto parts are scheduled to begin by May 3. A process to assess and certify US content in vehicles assembled in North America under USMCA is still being developed.Trump has hinted at further moves — including a tax deduction for interest on car loans, but only for American-made vehicles. That could further tilt the playing field in Tesla’s favor, especially as it pushes to lower prices and expand EV adoption.“If you borrow money to buy a car, you’re allowed to deduct interest payments... but only if the car is made in America,” Trump said.Tesla may emerge as one of the least affected players in the wake of Trump’s tariffs, but it’s not a free pass. Costs are rising, parts of its supply chain are under threat, and the entire industry is entering a period of volatility and uncertainty.Musk’s warning underscores the reality: even domestic automakers are caught in the storm. Still, with rivals facing steeper cost hikes and supply disruptions, Tesla’s relative advantage could become more pronounced — if it can navigate the new terrain without losing its footing.(With inputs from agencies)","Tesla manufactures all of the vehicles it sells in the US domestically.

US stocks showed mixed movement on Wednesday as Wall Street saw more subdued trading following recent swings in both directions. While most stocks were on the rise, several key tech stocks, including Nvidia and Tesla , faced continued challenges, dragging the Nasdaq toward a 1.2% drop.The S&P 500 slipped 0.4% in morning trading, possibly heading for a second quiet day in a row. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 201 points, or 0.5%, as of 10:45 a.m. Eastern Time. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq composite struggled due to further declines in Nvidia and Tesla, which weighed heavily on the index, according to news agency AP reports.Big Tech stocks, which had been central to the US stock market ’s recent sell-off, are facing increased volatility.Earlier this month, the S&P 500 dropped 10% from its all-time high, marking its first “correction” since 2023. Big Tech’s meteoric rise, particularly in the wake of the AI boom, led to concerns that their valuations had outpaced profits, contributing to the recent downturn.Nvidia took a 4.7% hit, bringing its loss for the year to 14.4%, making it the biggest drag on the S&P 500. Tesla, also facing headwinds, fell 4.1%, extending its loss for 2025 to 31.6%. The electric-vehicle maker is grappling with both internal issues and external challenges, including political backlash against CEO Elon Musk.Despite the setbacks, the US stock market has steadied somewhat after its correction. The S&P 500 is now within 6.5% of its record high, but Wall Street strategists caution that volatility may persist, especially with a set of US tariffs set to take effect next month. Even if the tariffs don't significantly harm the global economy, the uncertainty surrounding them has already dampened consumer and business confidence.While the US economy and job market have shown resilience, economists are watching closely for signs that the hit to confidence is affecting broader economic activity. A report released Wednesday morning showed unexpected growth in orders for machinery, airplanes, and other durable goods last month, defying expectations of a contraction. However, a key subset of the data, which excludes aircraft and defence products, shifted from growth to contraction, signalling that businesses may be holding back on investments amid tariff concerns.In the bond market, Treasury yields fluctuated following the data, with the 10-year Treasury yield rising slightly to 4.34%, up from 4.31% on Tuesday.There were some bright spots on Wall Street, including GameStop, which surged 13.1% after reporting better-than-expected quarterly results. The video game retailer also announced plans to invest part of its treasury in bitcoin. Dollar Tree also saw a 7.6% increase after announcing it would sell Family Dollar to two private equity firms for $1 billion, following a decade of struggling to integrate the bargain chain. Additionally, Dollar Tree posted stronger-than-expected profits for the latest quarter.Cintas rose 8.1% after the work uniform supplier reported better-than-expected profits.Overseas, stock markets in Europe and Asia were mixed.

BlackRock-led Panama port deal: Why it is a setback for Xi Jinping and China,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/panama-port-deal-ck-hutchison-holdings-ltd-li-ka-shing-blackrock-trump-and-xi-jinping/articleshow/119542990.cms,"AI image for representation only.

On the face of it, it’s a straightforward transaction. CK Hutchison Holdings Ltd plans to sell two of its ports near the Panama Canal as part of a broader $19 billion divestment. But in geopolitics, nothing is just what it seems. With President Donald Trump hailing the sale as a reclamation of American influence over the Panama Canal and China condemning it as a betrayal, what might have been a quietly lucrative exit has become an international flashpoint.

Driving the news

CK Hutchison Holdings Ltd, the flagship conglomerate of Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-shing , is pressing forward with a high-stakes deal to sell two ports on the Panama Canal to a consortium led by BlackRock Inc — despite growing backlash from Beijing.

The deal will hand over control of 43 ports in 23 countries, including the strategic Balboa and Cristobal terminals in Panama.

Li’s firm has kept ports in mainland China and Hong Kong off the table — a decision that has done little to defuse Beijing’s anger.

Why it matters

The port sale, once hailed as a savvy business move, has escalated into a geopolitical firestorm. It pits one of Asia’s most iconic tycoons against the full weight of Chinese state media, regulators and political sentiment — with US President Trump cheering from the sidelines.

“It is not an exaggeration to say that the transaction will cause endless troubles to China’s economy and national interests,” Beijing-backed newspaper Ta Kung Pao warned in a recent commentary, another Bloomberg report said.

China does not run the canal, but Li’s presence—through a Cayman Islands-registered firm with strategic assets—offered Beijing a foothold in the region. With the proposed sale, that leverage is seen to be slipping.

The blowback against Li Ka-shing underscores how China under President Xi Jinping expects political loyalty from high-profile business figures, particularly those based in Hong Kong, which Beijing now treats as a tightly controlled extension of its system post-2019 protests.

Trump, meanwhile, is reveling in the symbolism: He hailed the deal as evidence of the US regaining leverage in Latin America. Trump's inaugural promise to ""take back the Panama Canal"" has now been echoed in headlines—even if the deal was brokered not by Washington, but by Goldman Sachs bankers.

The big picture: Strategic asset, symbolic battleground

After enjoying cordial relations with previous Chinese leaders, Li’s ties to the mainland appear to have weakened since Xi took the top job in 2013. He’s earned a new moniker too: dubbed ‘Cockroach King’ for what critics called his closet support of Hong Kong’s pro-democracy movement. An Bloomberg report titled 'Why Billionaire Li Ka-shing's Panama Ports Deal Infuriates China'

What they’re saying

Ta Kung Pao, a pro-Beijing newspaper, has slammed CK Hutchison’s “spineless groveling” and “betrayal of all Chinese.” “This is a concrete manifestation of US attempts to put pressure on China’s supply chain by controlling key ports,” Ta Kung Pao argued, warning that the sale “will cause endless troubles to China’s economy and national interests.”

“Those who emphasize freedom of contract are too naive and confused,” Ta Kung Pao wrote.

Chinese regulators, including the state administration of market regulation, are reportedly probing the deal for national security and antitrust issues.

Beijing’s Hong Kong office has reposted harsh critiques, amplifying the signal that this isn’t just a media outburst — it reflects central government displeasure.

Cancelling the deal would be risky, George Chen, managing director for Hong Kong at The Asia Group, told AP. “Strictly speaking, you just let Trump take credit for it, then you later say ‘Sorry, I’m canceling the deal.’ You can imagine what Trump’s reaction would be,” he said, adding that would also affect how the outside world views Hong Kong businesses.

CK Hutchison and BlackRock? Radio silence: Neither company has responded publicly.

BlackRock’s spokesperson declined comment, and Li Ka-shing has not made a public appearance since the backlash began, the Bloomberg report said.

Zoom in: Who is Li Ka-shing?

As per an AP report, nicknamed “Superman” for his rags-to-riches story and business prowess, Li is one of Asia’s most influential tycoons. Born in mainland China in 1928 and raised in Hong Kong, he built an empire that spans ports, real estate, telecom, retail, and energy.

At 96, he’s largely stepped back from public roles — his son Victor Li now chairs CK Hutchison — but his shadow still looms large over Hong Kong’s business and political scene.

His fortune, estimated at over $30 billion, includes stakes in CK Asset, CK Hutchison, Zoom, and Cenovus Energy. But despite decades of balancing between East and West, this may be his toughest political test yet.

Beijing once saw Li as a stabilizing pillar of Hong Kong’s capitalist system. Now, he's derided in Chinese media as the “Cockroach King.”

Between the lines

CK Hutchison has been quietly reducing its exposure to China for years. Its latest earnings show just 12% of revenue comes from Greater China. The bulk now flows from Europe, Australia, and Canada.

The port sale helps CKH shed volatile assets and gain liquidity — but it’s being framed as a snub to Beijing at a sensitive time.

China’s top brass, according to media reports, had hoped to use the Panama port assets as leverage in negotiations with Washington. Li’s surprise deal, allegedly struck without notifying Beijing, disrupted that calculus.

The exclusivity clause in CK Hutchison’s negotiations effectively blocks any last-minute bids from Chinese state-owned enterprises — another point of friction.

What’s next

The deadline to sign is April 2, and there’s little indication the deal will be delayed — barring a sudden political U-turn.

Analysts say Beijing has limited legal recourse since the assets lie outside Chinese jurisdiction. But retaliation through regulatory pressure in Hong Kong or the mainland remains a real risk.

Hong Kong chief executive John Lee has tried to walk a tightrope, saying the deal would be evaluated “in accordance with the law” while echoing Beijing’s broader concerns about foreign coercion.

Panama’s government must still approve the sale. If Beijing applies pressure there — diplomatically or economically — it could pose the biggest risk to the transaction.

As per a Bloomberg report, people familiar with the matter say the agreement, part of a broader $19 billion global port sale, remains on track for signing by April 2. Final due diligence, tax and accounting terms are being finalized.The Panama Canal carries nearly 3% of global shipping trade. Though operated by the Panamanian government, the ports at either end—Balboa and Cristobal—have become strategic flashpoints in the broader US-China contest for influence in Latin America.CK Hutchison first entered Panama in 1998 under a 25-year concession, quietly anchoring Li’s global ports network. That arrangement had attracted little attention until recently, when Trump began framing the canal as a metaphor for American decline—and China’s rise.In the current global climate, ports are not just ports. They are nodes of influence, supply chain leverage points, and potential tools of coercion. And the sale of those ports to a US-led consortium has prompted Beijing to treat what was once a business matter as a national affront.Victor Li, Li Ka-shing’s son and CK Hutchison’s current chairman, made no mention of the deal in the company’s latest earnings statement. But he did caution about a “volatile and unpredictable” global business environment—likely an understatement given the firestorm that has followed.(With inputs from agencies)","CK Hutchison Holdings Ltd plans to sell two of its ports near the Panama Canal as part of a broader $19 billion divestment.

Are Trump's policies pushing US economy towards a recession?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/are-trumps-policies-pushing-us-economy-towards-a-recession/articleshow/119507566.cms,"Donald Trump

Actions versus feelings?

How determined is Trump?

Is there a cushion?

Is the US economy headed for a recession? Stocks have plunged. So have measures of consumer and business confidence. Forecasters expect slower growth, higher unemployment and faster inflation than they did just a few months ago - and Wednesday, policymakers at the Federal Reserve said they agreed.The administration has announced and then delayed tariffs; it has ended and then restored programmes. Even some experts who are sympathetic to President Donald Trump's aims worry that businesses will pull back on hiring and investing in the face of so much uncertainty - a word that the Fed chair used repeatedly in a news conference on Wednesday.Most forecasters still don't expect a recession. But they say the chances of one have risen sharply - a turnabout from when Trump took office. How likely is a downturn? Here are three big questions about the Trump economy.The evidence of a slowdown comes mostly from ""soft"" indicators. These are surveys showing that businesses are more reluctant to hire and invest, and that workers are more worried about losing their jobs.""Hard"" indicators - measures of actual activity - haven't shown the same weakness. Job growth was solid in Feb, for example. Retail sales slumped in Jan but rebounded last month, although less than forecasters had expected.Attitudes almost always change before actual behaviour does. A company that loses a contract today probably won't lay off its staff tomorrow; an employee who hears a rumour of job cuts might not immediately cancel a long-planned vacation. And even when behaviour does shift, it takes time to show up clearly in the economic data.But it is also possible that falling confidence won't ever translate into real-world decisions. Consumer confidence was low through much of the Biden administration, for example, but actual spending never faltered. And evidence suggests that sentiment measures have become less reliable in an era of extreme partisanship.Trump made tariffs a centerpiece of his campaign last year. But many people on Wall Street didn't believe he would follow through - in part because if he did, stocks would fall and Trump would reverse course. So far, that has been a losing bet. In his first term, Trump worried when markets fell and bragged when they rose. But when stocks fell after tariff announcements this month, he disregarded the selloff and refused to back down. ""Markets are going to go up and they're going to go down,"" he told reporters last week. He and members of his administration now suggest that a period of economic pain is necessary to balance the economy. (Hardly any economists agree.) Still, Trump could change tactics if the slump worsened.Coming into this year, most forecasters expected economic output to grow about 2%, adjusted for inflation. That's slower than the 2.5% it grew last year, but it's a long way from a recession. Yet even before Trump took office, some forecasters warned that the economy was not as strong as well-known indicators like the unemployment rate suggested. Hiring was slowing; the housing market was frozen in place; consumers were saving less to maintain their spending.""All of these things were pretty obvious even in Dec,"" said Neil Dutta of Renaissance Macro Research, a financial firm. He argues that a slowdown in growth was inevitable this year, regardless of who won the election - which would mean that Trump is operating with less of an economic buffer than most people believe.The economy has repeatedly proved doubters wrong in recent years, and it may do so again. But it doesn't take a recession to cause real hardship. Even a mere slowdown in growth could leave hundreds of thousands out of work - and, if history is any guide, send Trump's approval ratings through the floor. That's the kind of outcome presidents usually do everything in their power to avoid.","Most forecasters still don't expect a recession.

The Australian government has unveiled its 2025-26 federal budget, focusing on cost-of-living relief , tax cuts, and support for households, students and businesses.With a general election approaching, Australia’s treasurer Jim Chalmers introduced several measures aimed at easing financial pressure on Australians while addressing key economic challenges, including housing affordability and slowing economic growth, reported Bloomberg.One of the most significant highlights is the extension of tax cuts, which will reduce the tax rate for those earning between A$18,201 and A$45,000 to 14% by July 2027.According to Bloomberg, these cuts will result in an average tax saving of A$2,548 by the 2027-28 financial year.Households and small businesses will also receive automatic energy bill relief, with A$150 deducted from their power bills in quarterly instalments starting in July.This initiative is part of a broader A$1.8 billion package to help Australians cope with rising electricity costs, reported The Sydney Morning Herald.The government has pledged an A$8.5 billion investment in Medicare, expanding bulk-billed health services to reduce out-of-pocket expenses for patients.Additionally, A$689 million has been allocated to lower the cost of medicines under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, with the maximum cost of many medications dropping from A$31.60 to A$25.Student debt relief is another major policy announcement, with the government planning to wipe out 20% of student debt, benefiting over three million Australians.The move, combined with revised repayment thresholds, will cut an average of A$5,400 per student from outstanding loans, amounting to A$19 billion in total debt relief, according to The Sydney Morning Herald.Housing affordability remains a critical issue, yet the budget offers only limited solutions. The government announced an A$54 million investment in modular and prefabricated home construction to speed up development.The Help to Buy shared equity scheme has also been expanded from A$5.5 billion to A$6.3 billion, allowing more Australians to enter the housing market with lower deposits.For infrastructure, major investments include A$7.2 billion for Queensland’s Bruce Highway, A$1 billion for Sydney’s Southwest Rail Link and A$2 billion for Melbourne’s airport rail station upgrades.Despite these initiatives, the budget is projected to return to an A$27.6 billion deficit in 2024-25, deepening to A$42.1 billion in 2025-26. While economic growth is expected to improve slightly, inflation remains a key concern, with the Reserve Bank of Australia carefully monitoring public spending.Defence spending has also drawn attention, with no major new commitments beyond a slow increase to 2.3% of GDP by the early 2030s.This falls short of the 3% defence spending target encouraged by US President Donald Trump, potentially straining Australia’s relations with the United States, as per Bloomberg.With the upcoming election, the Albanese government is balancing economic relief measures with long-term financial sustainability.While tax cuts, student debt relief, and healthcare funding are welcomed, concerns over housing, fiscal discipline and defence spending may shape voter sentiment in the months ahead.","The Australian government has unveiled its 2025-26 federal budget.

Tesla's sales drop nearly half in Europe as backlash against Musk intensifies,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/teslas-sales-drop-nearly-half-in-europe-as-backlash-against-musk-intensifies/articleshow/119472948.cms,"(Pic courtesy: X/ Tesla)

(With input from agencies)

Tesla sales in the European Union dropped sharply in the first two months of the year, as Elon Musk's politics and outdated models may be driving consumers away.According to the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association (ACEA), Tesla's new registrations declined by 49 percent to 19,046 units in the first two months compared to the previous year's same period.This decline occurred despite the EU's overall electric vehicle sales increasing by 28.4 percent to 255,489 units during the same period, achieving a 15.2 percent market share.Tesla faces increased competition from newer Chinese and European electric vehicles, whilst operating with older models.The company's European reputation has suffered due to Musk's support for a German far-right party and his involvement with President Donald Trump's administration, which has had strained relations with the EU.Recent weeks have seen vandalism at various Tesla dealerships across the United States, alongside a substantial decrease in the company's stock value over the past month.In Germany, Europe's largest automotive market, there have been multiple incidents targeting Tesla vehicles, with eight cars being set on fire since 2024 began.These events followed Musk's controversial public support for the Alternative for Germany (AfD) party during the recent general election. German Tesla sales decreased by 76 percent in February, following January's 60 percent decline, according to official statistics.While German electric vehicle sales generally decreased after government subsidy cancellation, Tesla's decline contrasts with the sector's overall recovery.Despite upgrades to the popular Model 3 and Model Y, the vehicles maintain their original appearance. European consumers may have been deterred by reliability issues and the Cybertruck recall, despite the vehicle not being available in Europe.ACEA data shows Tesla's market share at 1.1 percent for January and February 2025, with February registrations dropping 47 percent to 11,743 units.Despite a slight market share improvement to 1.4 percent in the following month, Tesla remained behind Chinese manufacturer SAIC's MG brand of electric and hybrid vehicles.The electric car market expanded in Germany, Belgium, and the Netherlands, while gaining momentum in Spain and Italy, the ACEA added.","Tesla sales in the European Union dropped sharply in the first two months of the year.

The 150th anniversary of the Metre Convention in 2025 celebrates international collaboration in metrology . The Bureau International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM) has adoptedas the theme, highlighting metrology's role in driving progress and innovation.Over the past century and a half, metrology has evolved, incorporating changes to make it more stable and reliable. A notable example is the 2019 revision of the SI (Systeme Internationale) Units , redefining the kilogram, Ampere, Kelvin, and mole. The field of metrology is almost ancient, though, and not just a twenty first century phenomenon. In ancient Egypt, the standard unit of measurement of length was a cubit, which was equal to the length of the Pharaoh’s forearm, added to the width of his palm. Metrology has traversed a long and interesting journey starting from the age of first principles, then the golden period of the mechanical marvels, leading to the advent of electronics, and later digital, and now we are poised to experience contactless metrology.Let us take the example of the automotive industry, and the regular car you drive. The dimensional accuracy of brake discs is critical to prevent brake failures. Industrial metrology techniques, such as surface measurement and contour measurement, are used to measure the dimensions and surface finish of brake discs, ensuring the safety of drivers and passengers on the road. This is just one example of how industrial metrology impacts our everyday lives.This is but one example of how metrology is not an arcane subject for laboratories but affects us every day. Simply put, metrology is the scientific study of measurement. More pertinently, it is the application of such study to improve our lives.Metrology is not just for academics; it's closely tied to everyday life. Recent advancements include data-driven metrology for real-time analysis and quality predictions, non-contact measurement techniques like confocal microscopy and optical interferometry enable high-speed, high-precision inspections.As metrology integrates with Industry 4.0, smart measuring instruments and IoT devices enable continuous monitoring and adaptive adjustments, ensuring robust quality control with minimal human intervention. Fully automated metrology systems will drive efficiency and cost savings in the future.Leading this push towards the future in India is Mahr Metrology India Pvt Ltd , a 100% owned subsidiary of Mahr GmBH. They offer a wide range of dimensional metrology solutions, including simple callipers, form and surface measuring machines, and non contact measuring systems, to name just a few making them a significant player in the Indian Metrology Industry.Starting as a small family business in the Swabian town of Esslingen, Mahr GmBH has exemplified innovative metrology, and set quality and assurance benchmarks for over 160 years. Not many people know that Carl Mahr, founder of Carl Mahr Holding GmbH in 1862, made one of the very first calipers in 1868. Back then, it was called a caliber.But let’s get back to the future. The future of dimensional metrology is expected to be driven by advancements in automation, data analytics and precision engineering. As industries demand increasingly accurate measurements, Mahr is evolving and pivoting to integrate SMARTt technologies that enhance speed, accuracy, and efficiency.From traditional precision engineering sectors like ICE (Internal Combustion Engines) and power transmission to new-age domains like semiconductors, electronics, mobile telephony, medical implants, Optics, and even aerospace and defence, Mahr offers state-of-the-art cutting-edge solutions like MahrSurf 3D, OptoSurf and Mahr Engineered Solutions. For India to become a global manufacturing powerhouse, investments in quality assurance is key.

Hyundai announces record $20 billion investment in US,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/hyundai-announces-record-20-billion-investment-in-us/articleshow/119452125.cms,"Trump: 'Tariffs very strongly work'

'More investments, more jobs, and more money'

South Korea’s Hyundai has unveiled a massive $20 billion investment in US manufacturing , including a $5 billion steel plant in Louisiana, marking the company’s first steel production facility in the country. The announcement was made on Monday at the White House, alongside US President Donald Trump, Hyundai chairman Euisun Chung, and Louisiana governor Jeff Landry.The $5.8 billion Louisiana plant, which will produce over 2.7 million metric tonnes of steel annually, is expected to create more than 1,400 jobs and supply steel to Hyundai’s auto plants in Alabama and Georgia.Chairman Chung called it the auto giant’s largest US investment ever.Hyundai's announcement comes as more global firms ramp up US investments amid tariff concerns. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, Japan’s SoftBank, and Apple have all announced major expansion plans in the country. Apple recently pledged $500 billion to boost manufacturing and infrastructure across the US.Speaking at the White House, Trump linked the investment to his trade policies, saying, ""This investment is a clear demonstration that tariffs very strongly work."" His administration had previously introduced 25% tariffs on steel and aluminium imports and planned new levies on Asian and European car imports, set to take effect next month.Hyundai’s Euisun Chung acknowledged Trump’s role in the company’s decision, revealing that discussions about the US steel plant began in 2019 during a meeting in Seoul. He added that the announcement coinciding with Trump's second term made the moment ""even more special,"" CNN reported.White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt praised the development on social media, writing, ""More investments, more jobs, and more money in the pockets of hardworking Americans – all thanks to President Trump’s economic policies.""While such investment pledges are common during new presidential terms, their success varies. Trump’s 2017 announcement of a $10 billion Foxconn factory in Wisconsin, expected to create 13,000 jobs, ultimately resulted in a scaled-down investment of $672 million, producing fewer than 1,500 jobs.Despite Trump's push to ""save"" the US auto industry, American factories already produce the majority of North American auto production. In 2023, US assembly plants built 10.2 million vehicles, compared to 4 million in Mexico and 1.3 million in Canada.With Trump’s next wave of tariffs set for 2 April, more companies are expected to shift production to the US to avoid trade penalties.","The $5.8 billion plant will produce over 2.7 million metric tonnes of steel annually.

Trump to impose high tariffs on countries buying Venezuelan oil. Will it impact India?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/trump-to-impose-high-tariffs-on-countries-buying-venezuelan-oil-will-it-impact-india/articleshow/119450907.cms,"25% tariffs on Venezuelan oil



Will it impact India?



Failure to uphold agreement



The 'dirty 15' countries



US President Donald Trump on Monday announced high tariffs on imports from countries buying Venezuelan oil and gas—a move that could impact India, China, and others while fueling global trade tensions.""Venezuela has been very hostile to the United States and the Freedoms which we espouse. Therefore, any Country that purchases Oil and/or Gas from Venezuela will be forced to pay a Tariff of 25% to the United States on any Trade they do with our Country,"" Trump posted on Truth Social.Trump further accused Venezuela of ""purposefully and deceitfully"" sending criminals to the United States, including violent offenders and members of organisations such as Tren de Aragua.Trump has aggressively imposed tariffs on both allies and rivals, using them as a tool to exert economic and diplomatic pressure, since his return to the White House in January.The newly proposed 25% tariffs on Venezuelan oil, affecting both direct and indirect purchasers, could be implemented from April 2, as per Trump's signed directive.The implementation decision rests with the secretary of state, who will consult with other US agencies before determining whether to enforce these levies.These tariffs scheduled for April 2, coincides with Trump's planned announcement of reciprocal tariffs on other nations—a day he calls ""liberation day.""In addition to reciprocal tariffs, he has vowed to impose broad sector-specific duties on imported automobiles, pharmaceuticals, and semiconductors.The tariffs could impact India and China, as both nations import Venezuelan oil, along with the United States and Spain. Trump confirmed the 25% tariff would be additional to existing rates.The order stipulates that the 25% tariff will cease one year after a country's last Venezuelan oil import, or earlier at Washington's discretion.In 2024, India imported 22 million barrels of oil from Venezuela, which made up 1.5% of India's total crude oil purchases.In January 2024: The nation's imports increased to above 254,000 barrels per day, representing approximately half of Venezuela's aggregate oil exports, which totalled nearly 557,000 barrels per day during this period.In December 2023: India's crude oil imports stood at roughly 191,600 barrels per day. The distribution amongst companies showed Reliance Industries securing 127,000 barrels per day.Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) obtained 37,000 barrels per day, and the HPCL-Mittal Energy received 28,000 barrels per day.Last year in February, Venezuela exported approximately 500,000 barrels of oil daily to China and 240,000 barrels to the United States, according to AFP.Trump's announcement follows last month's suspension of the deportation pipeline between the US and Venezuela, citing Caracas' failure to uphold an agreement to take back migrants quickly. Following this, Venezuela withdrew from accepting these flights.Earlier on Saturday, Caracas announced reaching a new agreement with Washington to resume deportations, resulting in nearly 200 Venezuelan nationals being deported from the US through Honduras.Separately, the Trump administration extended the operational deadline for US petroleum corporation Chevron in Venezuela until May 27. The firm had been functioning under a sanctions exemption.Earlier, during an interview with Maria Bartiromo on Fox Business, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent indicated that Washington would approach trading partners to discuss tariff levels and non-tariff barriers.Bessent explained that countries could potentially avoid these levies by discontinuing their current practices.During the same discussion, Bessent mentioned that the tariffs would target approximately 15 percent of nations having trade imbalances with the US, referring to them as a ""dirty 15.""","US President Donald Trump on Monday announced high tariffs on imports from countries buying Venezuelan oil and gas.

Stocks rose in morning trading (US local time) as Wall Street attempts to navigate uncertainty amid an ongoing trade war . The S&P 500 jumped 1.1%, coming off its first winning week after a four-week losing streak. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.7%, while the Nasdaq composite gained 1.5%.Wall Street remains focused on how tariffs could impact inflation, consumer spending, and overall economic growth.Stocks have been subject to volatility as tariffs are announced, then either implemented or retracted. Meanwhile, genetics testing company 23andMe plunged after announcing it had initiated voluntary bankruptcy proceedings over the weekend.According to AP, Wall Street was sharply higher before the opening bell on Monday, as the momentum from last week carried over into the new trading week. Futures for the S&P 500 surged 1.1%, while Dow Jones Industrial Average futures rose 0.9%, and Nasdaq futures climbed 1.4%.Investors focused on corporate news while awaiting updates on US President Donald Trump ’s tariffs, which have caused significant market fluctuations in recent weeks. Genetics testing company 23andMe saw its shares drop nearly 42% in premarket trading after revealing it had initiated voluntary bankruptcy proceedings. The company had laid off nearly half of its staff last fall and was winding down clinical trials while assessing ""strategic alternatives"" for certain assets.Meanwhile, shares in The AZEK Co. surged 20% before the bell on Monday after the building materials company announced it would be acquired by Australia's James Hardie Industries in a cash-and-stock deal valued around $8.75 billion. This marked the second large deal in the sector within a week, following QXO Inc.'s announcement on Thursday that it was purchasing Beacon Roofing Supply Inc. for around $11 billion, including debt.Regarding tariffs, reports suggest President Trump may narrow his broad approach focusing specifically on countries with significant trade surpluses with the US, particularly in Asia. Markets have faced turbulence this year, reacting to each new tariff announcement.The ongoing trade war between the US and its key trading partners poses a threat to inflation and could negatively impact both consumers and businesses. Trump has set an April 2 deadline for implementing additional tariffs on trading partners, following previous deadlines that were often postponed or canceled at the last minute.Chinese Premier Li Qiang struck a conciliatory tone in a meeting with business leaders and US Senator Steve Daines, the first US congressman to visit Beijing since Trump took office in January. Li emphasized the importance of dialogue over confrontation, calling for win-win cooperation over zero-sum competition. The meeting also included leaders from major US businesses such as FedEx Corp., Boeing Co., Qualcomm, and Pfizer.AP’s report also highlighted that recent statements from Trump administration officials suggest that the list of affected countries may not be as broad as initially expected, and existing tariffs, such as those on steel, may not be cumulative. This has sparked optimism in the markets that Trump’s tariff plans may ultimately be less impactful than previously feared.In international markets, Hong Kong's Hang Seng gained 0.4% to 23,787.71, and the Shanghai Composite Index rose 0.2% to 3,370.03. In Tokyo, the Nikkei 225 slipped 0.2% to 37,608.49 following a preliminary report showing the fastest pace of manufacturing output decline in a year, accompanied by a sharp drop in new orders.

For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of carbon use per year.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

Startups will play important role in helping India become 3rd largest economy: CEA Nageswaran,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/startups-will-play-important-role-in-helping-india-become-3rd-largest-economy-cea-nageswaran/articleshow/105332523.cms,"Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Startups will play an important role in helping India become the third largest economy in the world, Chief Economic Advisor ( CEA ) to the Union government V Anantha Nageswaran has said.Nageswaran said that tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country due to improvements in infrastructure and supportive policies of the government, according to a KSUM release.The CEA, during his Leadership Talk on the concluding day of the Huddle Global 2023 organised by the Kerala Startup Mission (KSUM), said that India was the fifth largest economy on course to become the third largest in a few years.""In fact, I will say 7-in-7 is the buzz slogan, that is 7 trillion USD economy in seven years. Seven trillion USD economy size by 2030 is possible if India maintains its present growth trajectory, and in that journey startup entrepreneurs are going to play an important role,"" he is quoted as having said in the release.He was of the view that the active participation of startups in India in developing business models on the foundation of expanding physical and digital infrastructure will continue to generate efficiency, revenue and economic returns for the country.""The last decade has seen an exceptional transformation in the startup landscape in India, which has emerged as the third largest ecosystem globally, with over 1.12 lakh startups presently recognised by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) across 763 districts.""Among them, more than 110 are unicorns with a total valuation of around USD 350 billion,"" he said.The CEA further said that the country ranks second in innovation quality.He said that innovation in India was not just limited to certain sectors as startups were solving problems in 56 industrial sectors, with 13 per cent of them from IT services, nine per cent from health and life sciences, seven per cent from education, five per cent from agriculture and five per cent from food and beverages.Nageswaran also said it was significant that 49 per cent of the startups were from tier-2 and 3 cities which have turned to be game-changers as the business advantages in these locations enable entrepreneurs to operate at lower costs as compared to tier-1 cities.""Apart from improved infrastructure and the government's pro-active policies, the availability of a technically skilled talent pool is a huge advantage for startups to set up and flourish in tier-2 and tier-3 cities,"" he said.He said that historically there was a perception that small towns were difficult places to conduct business.""...but with improved internet penetration, vastly better physical infrastructure, road, rail and air connectivity and supportive government policies, this is no longer true,"" he said.He also noted Kerala's startup journey has been an inspiring one.The CEA said that KSUM has served as the catalyst since its establishment in 2006 to promote change that propelled the state into the forefront of the global startup arena.KSUM is the Kerala government's nodal agency established in 2006 for entrepreneurship development and incubation activities in the state.Nageswaran said that with over 4,000 registered tech startups, 63 incubators and 10 lakh square feet of incubation space, KSUM has not only met its goal of promoting technology-based entrepreneurship but has also earned the distinguished position of being among the world's top business incubators.The November 16-18 fifth edition of Huddle Global, India's biggest beachside startup conclave, was organised by KSUM at Adimalathura beach, near Vizhinjam, here.Attended by around 1,500 delegates, the event displayed sophisticated products from emerging sectors such as robotics, Artificial Intelligence , Machine Learning, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, life sciences, space tech, blockchain, IoT, e-governance, fintech, healthtech, agritech, edutech and SaaS from across the country.","Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran said tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country.

(AI image)

Gold price surpassed $4,450 in the current week after falling almost 4 % in the last week with the precious metal extending its upside today amid a renewed surge in geopolitical risk. This came with the United States (US) capture of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro.

This action came without the approval of Congress which had also prompted global outcry. Trump added that the US will be running Venezuela until it can do a safe, proper, and judicious transition. A combination of market expectations of lower interest rates in the US and growing geopolitical frictions has underpinned support from precious metals over the last few sessions.

President Donald Trump warned of another strike if Caracas resists US efforts to open up its oil industry and stop drug trafficking, and suggested possible action against Colombia and Mexico over illicit drug flows

Russia announced the revision of its stance at the peace talks with Ukraine, after an alleged drone attack in one of President Vladimir Putin’s residences, while US President Trump has elevated his tone against Iran since last week.

Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis President Neel Kashkari said on Monday that interest rates may be close to a neutral level for the US economy, leaving it to the incoming data to guide the central bank’s actions

Bullion hit an all-time high of $4,549.92 on Dec. 26. with leading banks forecast further gains this year, especially with the Fed expected to deliver additional rate reductions and Trump reshaping the US central bank’s leadership

Silver rose as much as 4% since the start of the week. In China, LONGi Green Energy Technology Co. said it would begin substituting base metals for silver in its solar cells in the latest move by the industry to mitigate the surging cost of the white metal.

Traders are turning their attention to a slew of US economic data due this week, headlined by the December jobs report on Friday.

Gold & Silver Price Outlook

Gold: Weekly view – Cautious upside with Consolidative bias

Silver: Weekly View - Volatile

In the near term, there’s concern that a broad rebalancing of commodity indexes might put pressure on prices. The record-breaking rallies in gold and silver could push passive tracking funds to sell some contracts to match new weightings, beginning Thursday this week.

Also Major commodity indices are set to sell a portion of their gold holdings based on the end-2025 price and their 2026 weight targets, potentially creating some turbulence in the short term

Silver stands at risk of highly volatile moves in the medium term as exchanges may raise margin money again in case prices continue to trend upwards in the near term as CDE (Chicago Derivative Exchange) raised margin money twice for silver by 25% in the last month.

Meanwhile another move toward new record highs in gold would likely be triggered if geopolitical tensions broaden further or if incoming US data reinforces expectations that the Fed will have to ease more aggressively than currently priced.

Bank Holidays January 2026: The new year 2026 has just begun and if your to-do list contains a bank visit, it’s a good idea to check when banks will be closed in January. A missed holiday can easily turn a routine bank visit into a wasted trip, especially in the first few days of the year when people are settling back into work and finances.Banks in India observe a mix of national and regional holidays, which means closure dates can differ from one state to another.Banks will remained closed in Mizoram, Tamil Nadu, Sikkim, Manipur, Arunachal Pradesh, West Bengal, Nagaland and Meghalaya on the occasion of New Year's Day and Gaan-Ngai.Banks will remain closed in Mizoram, Tamil Nadu in observance of New Year Celebrations and Mannam Jayanthi.Banks will remain closed in Uttar Pradesh for birthday of Hazrat Ali.Banks in West Bengal will remain closed in observance of birth day of Swami Vivekananda.Banks in Gujarat, Odisha, Assam and Arunachal Pradesh will be shut in on the occasion of Makar Sankranti and Magh Bihu.The states of Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Sikkim, Telangana and Andhra Pradesh will remain closed for Uttarayana Punyakala, Pongal, Maghe Sankranti and Makara Sankranti.Banks in Tamil Nadu will be shut in observance of Thiruvalluvar Day.Banks in Tamil Nadu will remain closed due to Uzhavar Thirunal.Banks in Tripura, Odisha, West Bengal, will remain shut in observance of the birthday of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose, Saraswati Puja (Shree Panchami), Vir Surendrasai Jayanti and Basanta Panchami.Banks will remain closed nationwide on the occasion of Republic day.Apart from these holidays, banks also remain closed on every second and fourth Saturday of the month.Knowing bank holidays in advance can help customers plan essential financial transactions and avoid last-minute delays. However, bank closure does not means that customers can not process their financial transactions during holidays. Even when branches are shut, online banking services, ATMs, mobile banking apps and UPI for fund transfers, bill payments and other routine transactions are available for customers.However, services that require a physical visit, such as large cash deposits, cheque clearances and issuing demand drafts, will not be available. To avoid inconvenience, account holders are advised to plan these activities in advance and make the most of digital banking options during closures.","Banks will remained closed in Mizoram, Tamil Nadu, Sikkim, Manipur, Arunachal Pradesh, West Bengal, Nagaland and Meghalaya on the occasion of New Year's Day and Gaan-Ngai.

500% tariffs ahead for India & China? Trump clears Russia sanctions bill; what it means,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/500-tariffs-ahead-for-india-china-trump-clears-russia-sanctions-bill-what-it-means/articleshow/126405011.cms,"Donald Trump Says PM Modi 'Not Happy With Me' Over Higher Russian Oil Tariffs

Also read:

US President Donald Trump has approved a new bill that allows massive duties on countries that import Russian petroleum products. The bill, 'Sanctioning Russia Act of 2025' threatens at least 500% tariffs on countries that ""knowingly engage in the exchange. "" US senator Lindsey Graham said that the bill, which is now headed for bipartisan approval aims to punish nations “who buy cheap Russian oil,” a move that could directly impact India’s energy imports and further strain its trade ties with Washington.The proposed legislation sets out sweeping punitive measures that would be triggered if the US President finds that Russian government or a person acting at Russia's direction refuses to negotiate a peace agreement with Ukraine. The measures will also be revoked in case a negotiated peace agreement is violated, another invasion of Ukraine or involved with overthrowing is initiated, dismantling, or seeking to subvert the Ukrainian government.The bill states that Trump ""must increase the rate of duty on all goods and services imported into the United States from countries that knowingly engage in the exchange of Russian-origin uranium and petroleum products to at least 500% relative to the value of such goods and services.""In his post on X, Graham said, ""After a very productive meeting today with President Trump on a variety of issues, he greenlit the bipartisan Russia sanctions bill that I have been working on for months with Senator Blumenthal and many others."" Explaining the crucial timing of the bill, the executive further added, ""Ukraine is making concessions for peace and Putin is all talk, continuing to kill the innocent.""""This bill will allow President Trump to punish those countries who buy cheap Russian oil fueling Putin’s war machine. This bill would give President Trump tremendous leverage against countries like China, India and Brazil to incentivize them to stop buying the cheap Russian oil that provides the financing for Putin’s bloodbath against Ukraine.""Earlier this week, Graham said that India was urging Washington to roll back steep tariffs imposed in August 2025, over the same issue. Graham claimed that India’s ambassador to the US, Vinay Mohan Kwatra, met him last month to highlight New Delhi’s reduced purchases of Russian oil and to seek relief from the additional 25% duties.Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One alongside Trump, the senator said, “I was at the Indian Ambassador's house a month ago, and all he wanted to talk about was how India is buying less Russian oil. And he asked me to tell the President to relieve the 25% tariff.” The tariffs were imposed in August, with the US arguing that India’s energy trade with Russia was indirectly supporting Moscow’s war effort in Ukraine. With the extra levy, total duties on certain Indian goods rose to 50%.Trump has openly acknowledged that the tariffs have strained ties with Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Addressing the House GOP Member Retreat, he said PM Modi was unhappy with the trade measures but pointed to a reduction in oil imports from Russia. “He’s not that happy with me because, you know, they’re paying a lot of tariffs now because they’re not doing the oil, but they are — they’ve now reduced it very substantially, as you know, from Russia,” Trump said.The US President has repeatedly warned India that tariffs could be increased further if it does not “help on the Russian oil issue,” directly linking trade pressure to the Russia–Ukraine conflict. He has argued that India’s purchases of discounted Russian crude fuel Moscow's war machine in Ukraine.India, however, has maintained a firm stance, rejecting Trump’s earlier claim that PM Modi had assured him New Delhi would stop buying Russian oil, clarifying that no such conversation took place. As Washington moves closer to advancing the sanctions bill, the proposed legislation could raise fresh uncertainty for India.At the same time, Trump has positioned himself as a potential broker in the Russia–Ukraine war, holding talks with both Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, though without any concrete breakthrough so far.","US President Donald Trump has approved a new bill that allows massive duties on countries that import Russian petroleum products.

Taxing the employee’s own PF savings

The bigger picture: When rules punish good behaviour

Tax on employer contributions beyond ₹7.5 lakh

Tax on the growth of such contributions

Tax on interest from their own PF contributions beyond ₹2.5 lakh

Tax on NPS pension at retirement

Tax again if early withdrawal triggers PF conditions

Why reform is required

For a country that prides itself on a thriving middle class, India’s tax treatment of retirement savings has begun to feel oddly out of step with economic reality. Over the past few years, a series of amendments—presented as “rationalisations”—have quietly created a minefield for salaried employees who believed they were doing the right thing by saving for their future.Three provisions stand out for the burden they impose: taxation of employer contributions to provident and superannuation funds beyond ₹7.5 lakh; yearly taxation of accretions on such excess contributions; and taxation of interest earned on the employee’s own PF contributions above ₹2.5 lakh. In isolation each may appear technical. Together, they are reshaping retirement planning in ways that leave employees with little clarity, greater financial anxiety, and a rising tax bill on income they do not even receive today.The first shock for employees came with the Finance Act, 2020, which capped employer contributions to recognised PF, approved superannuation funds and NPS at ₹7.5 lakh per year. Anything above that—common for senior professionals, mid-level employees in high-cost cities, and those in organisations with generous retirement policies—became taxable as a perquisite.But what stings more is that annual accretion—interest, dividend or similar growth—on this “excess contribution” is also taxed. This is a tax on notional income, long before the employee sees a rupee of it.Many describe this as an upfront penalty on saving. Unlike bonuses or cash payments, retirement contributions are locked in for the long term. Yet tax is now collected today on money that may only be received decades later. That mismatch betweenandhas become a major pain point.When exemption isn’t really exemptionThe hardship intensifies when the National Pension System comes into play. While the government justified taxing excess employer contributions by calling PF, superannuation and NPS an “EEE regime”, the law doesn’t fully support that claim.Under Section 10(12A), up to 60% of the NPS corpus can be withdrawn tax-free upon closure of the account or opting out of NPS. The remaining 40% must be used to purchase an annuity plan from a life insurance company, and the pension received from this annuity is fully taxable. Employees therefore argue that the premise of an entirely exempt regime is not accurate.The Finance Act, 2021 introduced another hit: PF interest earned on the employee’s own contribution beyond ₹2.5 lakh per year is taxable.For many mid-career employees, PF is the only disciplined savings instrument they rely on. A high PF contribution isn’t a luxury; it is a way to secure the future in the absence of universal social security.Yet the law now characterises high contributions—even when mandatory or part of salary structure—as an attempt to “enjoy full exemption”. The sting is sharper for those whose basic salary is high enough that the statutory 12% PF contribution itself may cross the ₹2.5 lakh threshold, triggering tax on interest even when the employee never intended to “over-contribute”. This change is seen as especially harsh in a country where inflation erodes purchasing power and pension adequacy is already a concern.“Also, these changes all appear to be part of the ultimate aim of the government to do away with all deductions and exemptions and make the ‘new tax regime’ the only regime available for all taxpayers,” says Ameet Patel, partner, Manohar Chowdhry & Associates.Across these provisions, a consistent theme emerges:India now taxes retirement savings more aggressively. Employees who save diligently, especially mid- to senior-level workers, face:The result is that long-term savings face multiple tax points.There is growing consensus across industry bodies that these provisions need urgent review. The argument is not about giving employees a windfall—it is about ensuring fairness and a safety net. With an ageing population, lack of a universal social security system applicable to all citizens, and rising cost of living, the existing provisions are detrimental . India’s salaried class feels squeezed—not because they don’t want to pay taxes, but because the system increasingly treats retirement savings as a luxury rather than a necessity. What was once a predictable, trusted savings pathway is now layered with caps, tax triggers, and compliance complications.“And this compounds the problems that the ageing population faces when insurance companies either refuse to issue new health policies to senior citizens or charge such high premia on the policies that having a Mediclaim policy becomes extremely expensive for such retired persons. As and when such a person needs large amounts to be paid to hospitals for medical treatments, the depleted savings are often inadequate and the entire family is put under huge financial stress,” concludes Patel.","India’s tax treatment of retirement savings has begun to feel oddly out of step with economic reality. A high PF contribution isn’t a luxury; it is a way to secure the future in the absence of universal social security.

"Despite US tariffs, GDP pegged to grow at 7.4%",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/at-7-mfg-expected-to-stay-robust/articleshow/126402081.cms,"Representative Image

At 7%, manufacturing expected to stay robust

India’s economy is estimated to grow by 7.4% in 2025-26, led by robust expansion in services and manufacturing, shrugging off the impact of trade tensions and global challenges. Data released by the National Statistics Office Wednesday showed the economy, Asia’s third largest, was estimated to grow at a two-year high and above the 6.5% logged last year, beating expectations of sluggish growth due to the impact of steep tariffs imposed by the US on imports from India and geopolitical tensions.The latest GDP number will help India retain the fastest growing major economy tag and comes as a major boost for policymakers grappling with trade headwinds and a tough global economic environment. Government has taken several steps, including GST cuts, and unleashed reforms to shield the economy from headwinds.The first advance estimates, used for preparing the budget, will undergo revisions after more data comes in and changes to the base year that the statistics office will undertake as part of its revamp of several key economic indices. NSO will release the second advance estimates on February 27.The services sector, which accounts for nearly 60% of the economy, is expected to power the expansion with an estimated rise of 9.1% in 2025-26, compared with 7.2% last year.The manufacturing sector remained robust and is estimated to grow by 7% in 2025-26 as opposed to 4.5% last fiscal while construction continued to be healthy at a growth rate of 7%, compared with an increase of 9.4% in 2024-25. Nominal GDP, which accounts for inflation, is estimated to grow by 8% in 2025-26.The crucial farm sector is estimated to grow by 3.1% in 2025-26, slower than the 4.6% registered last year but still robust. The mining sector is seen contracting by 0.7% in 2025-26 compared with a growth of 2.7% last year.“The first advance estimates of the GDP in general show a flat aggregate demand in FY26. The heads that have positively contributed include govt consumption with a growth of 5.2% in real terms. Exports have also held the forte with positive growth of 6.4%. Private consumption growth was tad lower at 7.0%, possibly due to slowdown in the agriculture sector. Per capita consumption registered a growth of 6.1%,” said Soumya Kanti Ghosh, group chief economic adviser at State Bank of India.“Uptick in govt consumption, traction in services has held up the demand in FY26, cushioning the impact of external headwinds,” Ghosh said in a note.","India's economy is estimated to grow by 7.4% in 2025-26, shrugging off the impact of trade tensions and global challenges.

Getting real with AI by tracking audited metrics is the need of the hour for IT firms. While companies highlighted aggressive AI adoption by giving out the percentages of new code generated by AI and workforce skilling metrics, audited financial data that presents the real productivity impact is yet to fully show up. A comparison of productivity metrics since 2020 shows that the much-touted AI push did not deliver a step-change in per-employee economics across global and Indian IT services firms. This is despite revenue growth being supported by M&A-led expansion and a sharply depreciating rupee, raising questions around the pace of underlying organic growth.Overall, the top 10 Indian IT services firms spent about $4.3 billion on acquisitions over the same period, underscoring the sector’s reliance on M&A to bolster growth. Infosys HCL Tech, and Wipro spent about $1 billion to acquire 7 companies in the first 9 months of the current fiscal. In 2024, Cognizant made two major acquisitions, including its second largest ever—the $1.3 billion purchase of US engineering R&D firm Belcan—along with the $430 million acquisition of ServiceNow partner Thirdera. More recently, it acquired 3Cloud to strengthen its Azure capabilities. Further, companies also became aggressive with large deals, promising ever-higher productivity gains and driving revenue growth by booking licence sales of software products such as Salesforce and Workday in their books to boost the revenue line.The data, compiled from a LinkedIn post by Ramkumar Ramamoorthy, partner at growth advisory firm Catalincs, compares pre- and post-pandemic productivity metrics, particularly after the launch of ChatGPT in November 2022. Accenture’s revenue per employee rose only marginally from $86,191 in August 2020 to $89,408 in August 2025, despite averaging more than a dozen acquisitions annually. EBIT per employee increased by just 3.6% over the same period. Notably, Accenture—one of the first firms to explicitly disclose AI revenue—said it will no longer report AI revenues separately, citing the deep embedding of AI across its core offerings rather than standalone projects.Among Indian peers, Infosys shows the strongest structural improvement, with revenue per employee rising from $53,591 in September 2020 to $59,297 in September 2025, though EBIT and net profit per employee remain largely flat. TCS recovered from its post-pandemic dip, lifting revenue per employee from $47,434 to $50,380, but EBIT per employee is only marginally above 2020 levels. In contrast, TCS recently called out AI revenue for the first time, with CEO K Krithivasan saying AI services reached $1.5 billion in annualised revenue, growing 16.3% quarter-on-quarter. Cognizant’s revenue productivity remained largely flat over 5 years, even as EBIT per employee improved through cost control, while Wipro continues to lag, with both revenue and EBIT per employee in 2025 still trailing or barely matching 2020 levels. “Despite massive forces such as large acquisitions, extreme offshoring driven by the pandemic and recent immigration changes, and a sharp depreciation of the rupee, metrics like revenue per employee, EBIT per employee and net profit per employee remained largely flat for large IT services companies,” Ramamoorthy said. While the picture may appear sobering, he added that firms are still in the early stages of building AI-ready talent and scalable use cases. “Only when enterprise-grade deployments happen at scale, these metrics move meaningfully. The next 12–24 months will be pivotal in translating AI’s promise into measurable business impact,” he added.",A comparison of productivity metrics since 2020 shows that the much-touted AI push did not deliver a step-change in per-employee economics across global and Indian IT services firms.

BENGALURU: TCS has put on hold the final anniversary appraisals for some employees due to work-from-office (WFO) non-compliance in previous quarters. TCS’s final anniversary appraisal process follows an annual cycle after the completion of an employee’s work anniversary. An anniversary (one-year completion) email is sent to eligible freshers, and the update is also reflected on the company’s intranet portal, Ultimatix. TCS, however, discontinued final anniversary appraisals for lateral hires in 2022.“Please note your anniversary appraisal process is completed but not processed further by corporate since you are WFO non-compliant till Q2 FY26 (July 2025 to September 2025). If your anniversary is not committed in January 2025 due to WFO non-compliance in Q3, as a consequence, you will be excluded from the FY26 banding cycle and no performance band will be released,” an email reviewed by TOI said. An email sent to TCS did not elicit a response until the time of going to press.The final anniversary appraisal process begins with the formal initiation of the appraisal, after which the supervisor creates the goal sheet for the employee.The employee then submits the goal sheet and discusses the expectations with the appraiser. Performance is evaluated based on parameters met throughout the year, and based on the final evaluation, the banding results are released.TCS employees are expected to work from the office five days a week. The company is the first among India’s major IT firms to act against employees who do not comply with this requirement. Other firms typically require office presence for two or three days a week. TCS has also linked variable compensation to attendance compliance to ensure adherence.TCS has updated its work-from-office (WFO) policy regarding exception requests last year. TOI had reported that TCS's note to Indian employees specifies that personal emergencies can be cited for up to six days per quarter, without the option to transfer unused days to the following quarter. The company’s communication also addressed space constraints by allowing staff to submit up to 30 exceptions in a single entry. Network-related issues can be cited for five entries simultaneously. TCS has prohibited bulk uploads or backend entries for seeking exceptions to the office attendance requirement.",TCS has put on hold the final anniversary appraisals for some employees due to work-from-office (WFO) non-compliance in previous quarters.

NEW DELHI: India will soon join a select group of nations that have a final assembly line (FAL) for commercial fixed-wing aircraft. The Adani Group has tied up with Brazil's Embraer to make in India the latter's popular regional jets, which are operated on short- to medium-haul routes with seating capacity ranging from 70 to 146 passengers.Last month, Adani Aerospace signed an MoU with Embraer in Brazil for the FAL, in the biggest boost for PM Modi's make-in-India programme in the aviation space. The two groups did not comment on the story.Details such as the site and investment for the proposed FAL and when it will get operational are not yet known. A formal announcement is expected later this month at the Hyderabad air show.Being the world’s fastest growing aviation market with over 1,800 planes on order from airlines, including Air India group, IndiGo and Akasa, govt has been keen that global aerospace majors set up final assembly lines (FALs) for commercial aircraft in India.With Embraer taking the lead, govt is looking at ways to incentivise customers who order from India’s first major commercial aircraft FAL. Its success and the presence of an ecosystem for assembling commercial planes, govt feels, will nudge the big two — Airbus and Boeing — to follow suit instead of just focussing on increasing their sourcing from the country.“Several things are under consideration, including fiscal incentives for those ordering from this FAL.Like any new programme, the idea is to give incentives on a reducing basis as the orders grow, say, after every 50 orders placed,” said an official.Embraer has a footprint with nearly 50 aircraft of 11 types in India, covering commercial, defence, and business aviation.At present, in the commercial airline space, Star Air uses Embraer and is likely to order more of these regional jets. With no Airbus and Boeing single-aisle aircraft available for delivery till almost the middle of next decade for fresh orders placed now, some startups in India are planning to launch operations with Embraer.“There is a vast market for our capacity aircraft that ranges from 80 to 146 seaters. We believe India will require 500 such aircraft in the next 20 years,” Raul Villaron, Embraer senior VP, had said.Gautam Sahni, MD of Subha Aviation and leading Indian charter operator for two decades, has sought govt nod for operator’s permit. Sahni is said to be in talks with Embraer.“I am awaiting clearance from govt and can’t comment any further. But it’s a fact that the Indian regional aviation market is gearing up for massive growth thanks to new airports opening in tier II and III cities and the focus on the subsidised Udan scheme. Delhi and Mumbai getting secondary airports each will boost regional flights connectivity from these two mega urban centres,” said Sahni, who plans to have his base in the upcoming Noida Airport.Last June, Embraer had told TOI it would increase sourcing and could even set up an FAL based on getting sizeable orders from India. It already has a fully owned Indian subsidiary to scout for business opportunities across defence, commercial aviation, business aviation, services & support space here.",The Adani Group has tied up with Brazil's Embraer to make in India the latter's popular regional jets. Details such as the site and investment for the proposed FAL and when it will get operational are not yet known.

GDP data shows govt set to meet fiscal deficit target,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/gdp-data-shows-govt-set-to-meet-fiscal-deficit-target/articleshow/126402072.cms,"Sticking To Receipts, Spending Projections Seen Holding Key

NEW DELHI: The latest GDP numbers at current prices will provide cheer to the Centre’s budget team as it works out the final set of numbers for the current fiscal year.Although the nominal GDP growth was estimated at 8%, slower than the 10.1% assumed at the time of presenting the budget, the latest data released by the National Statistics Office on Wednesday estimated full year GDP at Rs 3,57,13,886 crore, marginally higher than the Centre’s projection of Rs 3,56,97,923 crore.The Centre had budgeted for a fiscal deficit of Rs 5,23,846 crore, or 4.4% of GDP. Based on the NSO’s first advance estimate, it will be marginally lower, provided govt is able to stick to its receipts and expenditure projections.While the tax revenue growth has been weak, there is support from higher dividend transfer by RBI to govt. Moreover, in the fiscal year so far, govt has gone slow on revenue expenditure, while strongly pushing capital expenditure.What complicates matters is the slower growth in nominal GDP due to low inflation that will have a bearing on taxes.“While the tax revenue growth has been weak, there is support from higher dividend transfer by RBI to govt. Moreover, in the fiscal year so far, govt has gone slow on revenue expenditure, even while strongly pushing the capital expenditure,” added Rajni Sinha, chief economist at CareEdge.In the last budget, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman had announced direct tax cuts and yet budgeted to stick to the deficit reduction plan.But the move to reduce GST rates on 375 items is expected to impact collections, both for the Centre and the states.Sitharaman has, however, stuck to her deficit targets in the post-Covid period, giving analysts hope that this year’s revised estimates will be no different.“Nominal growth, on the other hand, will be softer at 8% this fiscal compared with 9.8% in fiscal 2025. The gap between real and nominal GDP growth estimates, at 0.6 percentage point, is at its lowest level in the 2011-12 series. The lower nominal GDP growth puts some pressure on deficit targets as these are measured as a percentage of nominal GDP,” ratings agency Crisil said in a note.","Latest data released by the National Statistics Office on Wednesday estimated full year GDP at Rs 3,57,13,886 crore.

But, is investment in SCSS sufficient for retirees? How do other investment options like bank fixed deposits, small savings schemes, mutual funds compare on a return and taxation basis? We break it down for you:

Senior Citizens Savings Schemes (SCSS): Eligibility, Investment Limits, Taxation - Top Points

The Senior Citizens Savings Scheme is open to resident Indians - any individual who is 60 years and above at the time of opening the account.

In special cases, individuals aged 55 years or above but below 60 years may also open an SCSS account if they have retired on superannuation or otherwise. However, this can be done when the SCSS account is opened within three months of receiving their retirement benefits.

Retired members of the defence services, excluding civilian defence staff, are also permitted to open an account on attaining the age of 50 years, subject to compliance with the prescribed conditions.

Also, the spouse of a government employee who attained the age of 50 years and died in harness may open an account under this scheme.

A joint SCSS can also be opened but in this case the entire deposit is treated as belonging solely to the first account holder.

For an SCSS account, the minimum account opening balance is Rs 1,000. The total investment account across all accounts cannot exceed Rs 30 lakh. Both spouses can open individual accounts or joint accounts with one another, subject to a maximum deposit of Rs 30 lakh per account, provided that they both meet the eligibility criteria independently.

SCSS accounts lock in the money for a period of 5 years and can be prematurely closed subject to certain conditions.

Senior Citizens Savings Scheme Scheme - Top Points

In case any amount above the maximum limit is deposited, it is refunded and the interest on such an excess amount is payable only at the Post Office Savings Account rate for the period from the date of excess deposit until the date of refund.

Investments made under the Senior Citizens Savings Scheme are eligible for deduction under Section 80C of the Income Tax Act, 1961 - which means that individuals filing their tax return under the old tax regime can avail this tax benefit.

Tax is deducted at source (TDS) if the total interest earned across all accounts, including SCSS, exceeds the prescribed threshold during a financial year, unless Form 15G or Form 15H is submitted, as applicable.

An account holder may extend the SCSS account for additional blocks of three years, any number of times. The extension must be requested within one year from the date of maturity or from the end of each three-year extension period, using the prescribed form at the concerned post office.

The extended account earns interest at the rate applicable on the date of original maturity or the date of extended maturity, as the case may be. If the account is closed before one year from the date of extension, a deduction of 1 percent of the deposit is made.

The extension is considered effective from the original maturity date, regardless of when the application is submitted.

Senior Citizens Savings Scheme (SCSS): Is it a good investment bet?

How does SCSS compare to bank FDs for senior citizens?

SCSS offers a fixed 8.2% annual interest rate as compared to bank FDs which are currently offering interest rates in the range of 6 to 7.25 % depending on the bank. Both have fully taxable interest but SCSS principal of up to Rs 1.5 lakh qualifies for Section 80C deduction, unlike most FDs (only 5-year tax-saver FDs qualify). SCSS proves to be better on a post tax basis because of its higher interest rate.

SCSS vs other investment options & the right portfolio mix

Post office monthly Savings Scheme: Provides fixed monthly interest income at 7.4% per year with a fixed 5 year tenure. There is no tax benefit for this scheme Bank FDs : Generally, banks and NBFCs offer an additional interest rate of 0.50% over the normal fixed deposit rates. The tenure is flexible as investment can be done from 7 days to 10 years duration. Mutual funds: For senior citizens, who focus on capital safety, low-equity options such as Debt Funds and Conservative Hybrid Funds are generally more suitable.

How SCSS compares to other options

Is SCSS sufficient for retirement needs?

Senior Citizens Savings Scheme or SCSS is a popular Post Office investment and savings scheme for senior citizens and retired individuals. The government-backed scheme is seen as a guaranteed cushion for regular interest income flow, especially for individuals who are looking for high interest rates but low risk options.SCSS accounts help earn interest payments on a quarterly basis and with the investment limit doubled to Rs 30 lakh from Rs 15 lakh a few years ago, Senior Citizens Savings Scheme continues to attract substantial flows.The interest on your SCSS account is calculated and paid on a quarterly basis from the date of deposit, for the quarters ending on 31 March, 30 June, 30 September, and 31 December.According to the rules, the interest amount is credited to the SCSS depositor’s savings account on 1 April, 1 July, 1 October, and 1 January, respectively.Account holders may opt for automatic credit of interest to their savings account or through the ECS facility.Any interest not claimed in a quarter does not earn further interest.At the current interest rate of 8.2%, if a senior citizen were to invest the maximum limit of Rs 30 lakh, the quarterly interest earnings would stand at Rs 61,500, which is Rs 2.46 lakh in a year.Over a period of 5 years, the total interest earnings on the Rs 30 lakh investment will stand at Rs 12,30,000/-Experts are of the view that the guaranteed returns and an interest rate higher than most investment products makes SCSS an essential part of a senior citizen’s investment portfolio.Mohit Gang, Co-founder and CEO of Moneyfront explains that SCSS being a government-backed scheme works in its favour. “The scheme is currently offering 8.2% interest, which is higher than fixed deposit interest rates from all the banks,” he notes.“SCSS offers a regular income to senior citizens in the form of quarterly interest payouts on deposits up to Rs 30 lakh for a 5-year lock-in which is extendable by another 3 years. The deposit amount can also be claimed as a deduction under Section 80C,” he tells TOI listing the advantages of the scheme.Rohit Shah, Certified Financial Planner & Founder of Getting You Rich points out that the interest rate for SCSS is among the highest in government-backed small savings. It also typically beats senior-citizen bank fixed deposits on safety‑adjusted return, he says.“The appeal is clear: sovereign guarantee, quarterly interest for regular income, capital protection, and Section 80C benefit on investment up to Rs 1.5 lakh. For risk‑averse retirees who want predictable cash flows, it is a strong core product,” Rohit Shah tells TOI.When SCSS is compared with bank fixed deposits on a post-tax basis, the picture becomes interesting. While both instruments generate interest income that is fully taxable as per the investor's income tax slab, SCSS has a clear edge with its 8.2% rate compared to typical bank FD rates of around 7-7.5% for seniors.“More importantly, SCSS offers rate certainty. So once you lock in the 8.2%, it stays fixed for the entire 5-year tenure, regardless of future rate movements,” says Dev Ashish, SEBI Registered Investment Advisor and founder of StableInvestor.com.Mohit Gang of Moneyfront also notes that SCSS proves to be better than bank fixed deposits on a post-tax, inflation-adjusted return basis for senior citizens in India, primarily due to its higher interest rate and tax deduction benefits.Senior‑citizen bank FDs generally offer around 6.5–7%. Some NBFC and corporate FDs may match or exceed SCSS’s 8.2%, but they come with higher credit and liquidity risk, which many retirees should avoid, says Rohit Shah.“Thanks to its rate advantage of roughly 100 bps over most bank FDs, SCSS will typically deliver superior post‑tax income for the same risk level. However, adjusted for inflation, both SCSS and FDs still struggle to fully keep pace with real‑life inflation, especially in healthcare and services,” he adds.According to Dev Ashish, there is one practical reality that often gets overlooked. Most retirees don't have substantial income sources beyond their investments.Consider a senior citizen couple parking Rs 60 lakh in SCSS (Rs 30 lakh each). At 8.2%, this generates Rs 4.92 lakh in annual interest income.Even if we add another Rs 3-4 lakh from other sources, their total income typically stays well below Rs 8-9 lakh annually.Under the new income tax regime with its Rs 12 lakh tax-free threshold (via enhanced standard deduction and Section 87A rebate for income up to Rs 12 lakh), many retired couples will end up paying zero income tax on their investment income. This dramatically improves the post-tax returns from SCSS, he says.“So while we discuss taxation of interest income, the ground reality is that for a large section of middle-class retirees without pension or rental income, the effective tax impact on SCSS returns is often negligible. This makes the 8.2% rate even more attractive - you're essentially getting the full gross return as your net return. This is a significant advantage that shouldn't be underestimated when comparing SCSS with other investment options where capital gains are taxed irrespective of the quantum of gains,” he adds.So, what are the alternatives to SCSS, how do they compare on a post-tax basis and what should be the right portfolio mix for senior citizens? Experts are of the view that SCSS is a very good investment option, others can be made use of for portfolio diversification.Mohit Gang elaborates:Rohit Shah lists some of the alternatives worth considering:•⁠ ⁠Government of India/RBI floating‑rate savings bonds (7‑year, floating coupon).•⁠ ⁠NSC (National Savings Certificates), with attractive compounded rates but lower liquidity.•⁠ ⁠Post Office Monthly Income Scheme (POMIS), which offers monthly payouts at slightly lower yields.“NSC can marginally outperform SCSS on returns but locks in money for longer and does not provide quarterly income. POMIS is useful for steady income but generally yields less than SCSS,” he says.According to Dev Ashish, the real question isn't just whether SCSS is good in isolation, but rather it's about understanding where it fits in a senior citizen's overall retirement portfolio, which not only needs to cater to their income needs but also keep an eye on moderate growth to ensure portfolio longevity in line with retirees’ life expectancy.He says that for someone worried about longevity risk and running out of money, parking a portfolio in annuities can also provide peace of mind, even if rates aren't the highest.“While SCSS, in my view, is an excellent debt option - safe, high-yielding, and tax-efficient, it is still advisable not to treat it as the entire portfolio and rather a core part of the fixed-income (debt) side of the portfolio. It's best to combine it with liquidity buffers and modest equity exposure for sustainable retirement, beat long-term inflation and preserve purchasing power,” Dev Ashish tells TOI.The approach he advocates is a bucketing strategy:The first bucket (typically 60-70% of the retirement corpus) should comprise debt instruments like SCSS, POMIS, PPF, debt funds, and annuities. This bucket generates regular income for day-to-day expenses. SCSS fits perfectly here as a core holding.But the second bucket is equally critical. This is the growth bucket where equity allocation (20-30% for most retirees) should be invested in well-diversified equity funds. Why? Because without equity exposure, your portfolio will struggle to beat inflation over a 20-30 year retirement period. The goal isn't to chase returns but to ensure you don't run out of money before running out of years.Mohit Gang is of the view that SCSS can serve as a core part of retirement but not as a standalone component in the portfolio because of limitations such as Rs 30 lakh individual limit, fully taxable interest and no equity-linked growth.He recommends an asset mix of 30% in SCSS + 30% in debt mutual funds + 20% in hybrid mutual funds + 20% Equity Funds.Rohit Shah also says that SCSS should be a core component, not the only one. “A sensible 60+ retirement portfolio should blend SCSS with other fixed‑income options (quality FDs, bonds, annuities) and a calibrated exposure to growth assets such as equity or conservative hybrid funds,” he tells TOI.The exact allocation must depend on each retiree’s risk profile, health, other income sources and legacy goals. The key is simple: use SCSS for stability and income, and complement it with carefully chosen products that offer liquidity and long‑term inflation protection, he advises.Bottom line - SCSS is a great investment product for senior citizens, but it is by no means sufficient and must be supplemented with other avenues.","The Senior Citizens Savings Scheme is open to resident Indians.

Cigarette tax hike: Experts warn of surge in illicit trade; fear major revenue losses for government,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/cigarette-tax-hike-experts-warn-of-surge-in-illicit-trade-fear-major-revenue-losses-for-government/articleshow/126334324.cms,"Representative image

A sharp increase in taxes on cigarettes, along with a new excise duty structure on tobacco products, could trigger a surge in illicit trade and lead to significant revenue losses for the government, experts have warned.Earlier this week, the finance ministry notified amendments to the Central Excise Act, introducing a fresh excise duty ranging from Rs 2,050 to Rs 8,500 per 1,000 cigarette sticks, depending on their length.The new excise duty, which comes into effect from February 1, will be levied in addition to the existing 40 per cent Goods and Services Tax ( GST ).This change implies an overall tax hike of around 60–70 per cent, varying by cigarette length, compared with the current overall tax incidence of about 50–55 per cent.The move marks a transition from the GST compensation cess to an excise-based regime for demerit goods.The unexpected nature of the tax increase has raised concerns about higher smuggling and illegal trade in tobacco products.According to news agency PTI, Ranganath Tannir, secretary general of Think Change Forum, said the steep rise could prove counterproductive. “Public finance theory is clear that excessive taxation of inelastic goods fuels illicit trade, not compliance,” he said, adding that cigarettes in India are already among the least affordable globally based on World Health Organization affordability indicators.Making them more expensive is unlikely to curb demand, but could push consumers towards illegal and smuggled products, undermining tax collections, he noted.Brokerage reports have echoed similar concerns. According to JPMorgan’s Asia Pacific Equity Research, a higher tax rate for the King Size Filter Tip (KSFT) segment increases the risk of consumers downtrading to cheaper options and may also lead to higher consumption of illicit cigarettes.Illicit tobacco already accounts for about 26 per cent of India’s total tobacco market, making the country the fourth-largest market globally for smuggled tobacco, PTI reported.Nomura, in its research note, said that while higher taxes are aimed at reducing consumption, they often have unintended consequences. “High taxes on cigarettes… fuel the growth of illicit cigarettes and push consumers towards cheaper, non-tax paid smuggled cigarettes,” the brokerage said.Jefferies, citing a report by the Tobacco Institute of India (TII), said the industry body has urged the government to review the proposed excise structure.A wider gap between legal and illegal prices could benefit non-duty-paid cigarettes and result in higher tax leakage, the report noted.Experts also pointed to international experience to underline the risks. Australia’s repeated tobacco tax hikes between 2012 and 2020 led to a sharp rise in cigarette prices and were followed by a jump in illicit tobacco consumption from under 2 per cent to around 14 per cent of the market.Calling the proposed excise levies “unprecedented”, an analyst said there is still time to reassess the decision before it comes into force.“Since they take effect from February 1, 2026, the government has an opportunity to revisit and rectify them before they spawn a much larger problem of uncontrollable illicit networks,” the analyst warned, as per PTI.","The finance ministry notified amendments to the Central Excise Act, introducing a fresh excise duty ranging from Rs 2,050 to Rs 8,500 per 1,000 cigarette sticks.

"California loses $160M for delaying revocation of 17,000 commercial driver's licenses for immigrants",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/california-loses-160m-for-delaying-revocation-of-17000-commercial-drivers-licenses-for-immigrants/articleshow/126405376.cms,"AP image

California will lose $160 million for delaying the revocations of 17,000 commercial driver's licenses for immigrants, federal transportation officials announced Wednesday.Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy already withheld $40 million in federal funding because he said California isn't enforcing English proficiency requirements for truckers.The state notified these drivers in the fall that they would lose their licenses after a federal audit found problems that included licenses for truckers and bus drivers that remained valid long after an immigrant's visa expired. Some licenses were also given to citizens of Mexico and Canada who don't qualify. More than one-quarter of the small sample of California licenses that investigators reviewed were unlawful.But then last week California said it would delay those revocations until March after immigrant groups sued the state because of concerns that some groups were being unfairly targeted. Duffy said the state was supposed to revoke those licenses by Monday.Duffy is pressuring California and other states to make sure immigrants who are in the country illegally aren't granted the licenses.""Our demands were simple: follow the rules, revoke the unlawfully-issued licenses to dangerous foreign drivers, and fix the system so this never happens again,"" Duffy said in a written statement. ""(Gov.) Gavin Newsom has failed to do so - putting the needs of illegal immigrants over the safety of the American people.""Newsom's office did not immediately respond after the action was announced Wednesday afternoon.Enforcement ramped up after fatal crashes The federal government began cracking down during the summer. The issue became prominent after a truck driver who was not authorized to be in the U.S. made an illegal U-turn and caused a crash in Florida that killed three people in August.Duffy previously threatened to withhold millions of dollars in federal funding from California, Pennsylvania, Minnesota, New York, Texas, South Dakota, Colorado, and Washington after audits found significant problems under the existing rules, including commercial licenses being valid long after an immigrant truck driver's work permit expired. He had dropped the threat to withhold nearly $160 million from California after the state said it would revoke the licenses.Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration Administrator Derek Barrs said California failed to live up to the promise it made in November to revoke all the flawed licenses by Jan. 5. The agency said the state also unilaterally decide to delay until March the cancellations of roughly 4,700 additional unlawful licenses that were discovered after the initial ones were found.""We will not accept a corrective plan that knowingly leaves thousands of drivers holding noncompliant licenses behind the wheel of 80,000-pound trucks in open defiance of federal safety regulations,"" Barrs said.Industry praises the enforcement Trucking trade groups have praised the effort to get unqualified drivers who shouldn't have licenses or can't speak English off the road. They also applauded the Transportation Department's moves to go after questionable commercial driver's license schools.""For too long, loopholes in this program have allowed unqualified drivers onto our highways, putting professional truckers and the motoring public at risk,"" said Todd Spencer, president of the Owner Operator Independent Drivers Association.The spotlight has been on Sikh truckers because the driver in the Florida crash and the driver in another fatal crash in California in October are both Sikhs. So the Sikh Coalition, a national group defending the civil rights of Sikhs, and the San Francisco-based Asian Law Caucus filed a class-action lawsuit on behalf of the California drivers. They said immigrant truck drivers were being unfairly targeted.Immigrants account for about 20% of all truck drivers, but these non-domiciled licenses immigrants can receive only represent about 5% of all commercial driver's licenses or about 200,000 drivers. The Transportation Department also proposed new restrictions that would severely limit which noncitizens could get a license, but a court put the new rules on hold.",Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy already withheld $40 million in federal funding. Duffy is pressuring California and other states to make sure immigrants who are in the country illegally aren't granted the licenses. The issue became prominent after a truck driver who was not authorized to be in the U.S. made an illegal U-turn.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126405407,imgsize-1140502,width-400,resizemode-4/.jpg"

The good news is that the US has announced that once there’s a deal, there will be a 0% tariff on natural diamonds. People do expect tariffs to end,” Cook said here.London-based De Beers Group which owns the Forevermark diamond brand supplies rough diamonds to several Indian partners who then cut and polish them here and export to the US. “The US put 50% tariffs on India and that’s challenging for the diamond industry because if you have got 90% of the world’s diamonds cut and polished in India and 50% of the world’s diamonds bought in America, that’s a huge market,” said Cook who met commerce minister Piyush Goyal.In 2024, total diamond exports from India stood at about $13 billion of which about 50% was shipped to the US, Cook said.A growing economy, expanding middle class which is willing to spen d more helped by higher disposable incomes, a new crop of high earning consumers and India’s love for jewellery will allow the country to retain its place as the second largest market for natural diamond consumption after the US, said Cook as the company launched its largest global flagship Forevermark store in Mumbai this week.Demand for natural diamonds grew 11% in India last year which overtook China where a declining rate of marriages—down by about 50% over the last decade has crippled sales of (diamond) engagement rings, said Cook. “In the short-term, we see stronger growth in India. It is just one of the most important countries on the earth right now and certainly, one of the most important countries in the diamond industry,” said Cook under whose watch, the company is localising offerings for Indian shoppers. More women are now buying diamond jewellery for themselves and taking to everyday pieces, a trend Forevermark is betting on with a target to close 2026 with 25 stores.","Export of diamonds from India to the US has nearly halved after President Trump slapped a 50% tariff on the country.

It was the reward for working hard, and doing the right thing, but now, because of the Record High Inflation caused by Joe Biden and the Democrats in Congress, that American Dream is increasingly out of reach for far too many people, especially younger Americans,” Trump posted.Trump and some conservative supporters argue that large investors buying homes for rent have reduced availability for ordinary buyers and pushed up prices and rents. This has frustrated potential homebuyers, particularly younger Americans trying to enter the market.Large institutional investors include private equity firms, real estate investment trusts, and major asset managers such as Blackstone and Cerberus that purchase residential properties to lease. Trump’s announcement targets these large players.The market reacted quickly to this update, with shares in companies heavily involved in single‑family rentals, including Blackstone, Invitation Homes, and American Homes 4 Rent, falling sharply after the announcement.Details on how the ban would be enforced have not yet been clarified.Despite the focus on institutional investors, data suggests they own a relatively small portion of the market. Blackstone has reported that such investors currently own about 0.5 percent of all single‑family homes in the US.According to a 2022 report from the US Government Accountability Office, investors owning 1,000 or more properties accounted for only 2–3 per cent of single‑family rental homes. Most investor-owned properties are held by smaller landlords who own between one and five homes, representing around 85 per cent of investor-owned homes.According to data provided by Newswire and Housingwire, Investor activity varies across the country and over time. Reports indicate that investors purchased nearly one-third of all single-family residential properties sold in mid‑2025, influenced by high mortgage rates and affordability challenges for traditional buyers. Out-of-state investors also remain active, accounting for around 5.56 per cent of single-family home purchases in 2025.The GOP leader said the ban is intended to make housing more affordable and protect the idea that “people live in homes, not corporations.""",US President Donald Trump announced on Truth Social that he is taking steps to ban large institutional investors from buying single‑family homes in US.

Industry Wary Of Chinese Cos Bringing Electrics Through Europe At A Lower Duty

Goyal seeks investment from Liechtenstein



NEW DELHI: As Indian and European negotiators enter what is seen to be the final rounds of talks for a free trade agreement (FTA), the local auto companies are wary of Chinese electric vehicles using European Union as a gateway to enter the domestic market at lower duty.As a result, auto players have demanded that govt negotiate the agreement in such as way that if needed, only high-end EVs are allowed into the country — with a high price threshold and in limited numbers — while also insisting on a high level of value addition, which could be 50% or more, people familiar with the deliberations told TOI.In the trade deal with the UK, which was signed last year, govt had protected EVs but the auto industry also realises that there are trade-offs to be made for a successful outcome.The worry, however, is bigger in the case of the European Union, given that some of the Chinese companies could use member nations of the trading bloc to locate assembly units and ship goods to India, taking advantage of the duty benefit. Some of the Chinese companies that have been hovering around have not been able to set up shop in the country due to checks on FDI and have been relying on imports to sell in the Indian market.“We are seeing Indian companies work hard on EVs and also move up the value chain. It is important to protect them at this time so that we have a strong eco-system for green vehicles before it is opened up to competition,” said an industry executive.Several global majors, including the likes of Tesla, Mercedes and BMW, are expected to use their European facilities to export EVs to India, a large and growing market where govt is also keen on a transition to green fuel. While Tesla is currently importing its vehicles from its Chinese facilities, lower tariffs are expected to result in shipments from the company’s German plant.The Centre’s scheme to allow lower duty import of electric cars for a limited period in return for investment in three years saw no response as some of the auto makers are waiting for the trade deals to be finalised before taking a call on their plans.Commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal on Wednesday invited companies from Liechtenstein to invest in India and leverage the India-EFTA trade pact to expand their presence. India and the four-nation European bloc EFTA implemented a free trade agreement last year.

While hiring remained weak, layoffs also declined, indicating that employers are holding on to existing workers even as they hesitate to expand their workforce, AP reported.The data points to a continued “low-hire, low-fire” labour market, where workers enjoy a degree of job security but unemployed people face difficulty finding new roles. This trend contrasts with broader economic indicators showing solid momentum, with US growth exceeding 4 per cent at an annual rate in the July–September quarter of last year. Economists expect growth to have slowed in the final months of 2025, but to have remained resilient.The November figure marked the lowest number of job openings since September 2024 and, excluding that month, the weakest reading in nearly five years.A key question for 2026 is whether hiring will accelerate to align with healthy economic growth, or whether persistent weakness in job creation could eventually weigh on the economy. Another possibility is that increased automation and the use of artificial intelligence could allow output to grow without a corresponding rise in employment.Further clarity is expected on Friday, when the government releases its monthly jobs report for December.The data was published as part of the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS), which offers insight into hiring, layoffs and worker turnover, and comes after last autumn’s US government shutdown delayed the release of several labour market and inflation indicators.","Businesses and government agencies reported 7.1 million open jobs at the end of November, down from 7.4 million in October.

Warner Bros. Discovery has once again turned down a takeover offer from Paramount, telling shareholders that the rival bid does not serve their interests and reiterating its recommendation to support a proposed $72 billion transaction with Netflix.In a statement on Wednesday, the company said its board had reviewed Paramount’s latest proposal and concluded that it “is not in the best interests of the company or its shareholders”, urging investors to stick with the Netflix agreement, AP reported.“Paramount’s offer continues to provide insufficient value, including terms such as an extraordinary amount of debt financing that create risks to close and lack of protections for our shareholders if a transaction is not completed,” Warner Bros. Discovery chair Samuel Di Piazza Jr. said. “Our binding agreement with Netflix will offer superior value at greater levels of certainty, without the significant risks and costs Paramount’s offer would impose on our shareholders. ”Paramount, controlled by Skydance, has taken its approach directly to shareholders after Warner’s leadership repeatedly rebuffed its overtures. The media group has sweetened its hostile bid to about $77.9 billion for the entire Warner Bros.Discovery company, compared with Netflix’s proposal, which covers only Warner’s studio and streaming assets.Late last month, Paramount announced an “irrevocable personal guarantee” from Oracle founder Larry Ellison to back $40.4 billion in equity financing for its offer. It also raised the promised payout to Warner shareholders to $5.8 billion if regulators block the deal, matching the break fee proposed by Netflix.In a letter to shareholders, Warner Bros. Discovery flagged concerns that Paramount’s proposal effectively resembles a leveraged buyout, involving heavy debt and a longer closing timeline of 12 to 18 months, increasing execution risk.The competing offers also differ sharply in scope. Netflix is seeking Warner’s studio and streaming operations, including legacy film and television production units and platforms such as HBO Max. Paramount, by contrast, is bidding for the entire company, which also includes cable and news networks such as CNN and Discovery.If the Netflix transaction goes through, Warner’s news and cable businesses would be spun off into a separate company under a previously announced plan.Any deal involving Warner Bros. Discovery is expected to face intense antitrust scrutiny in the US and overseas, given the size of the companies involved and the potential impact on competition in the global media and streaming industry.","Paramount, controlled by Skydance, has taken its approach directly to shareholders after Warner’s leadership repeatedly rebuffed its overtures.

Weak global cues spill over



Technicals point to consolidation, volatility risk



(Disclaimer: Recommendations and views on the stock market, other asset classes or personal finance management tips given by experts are their own. These opinions do not represent the views of The Times of India)

Equity indices extended their decline on Wednesday, with the Sensex and the Nifty ending lower for a third consecutive session as sustained selling in heavyweight stocks, rising geopolitical unease and weak global cues dented investor confidence.The BSE Sensex has shed over 1,144 points in the past three sessions, sliding from a close of 85,762.01 on January 2 to an intraday low of 84,617.49 on Wednesday. The NSE Nifty 50 has declined nearly 1 per cent over the same period, pushing benchmarks firmly into the red for the week.By the close, the Sensex had pared some losses to end 102 points, or 0.12 per cent, lower at 84,961.14, while the Nifty slipped 38 points, or 0.14 per cent, to settle at 26,140.75.Selling pressure in index heavyweights continued to exert disproportionate pressure on the benchmarks. HDFC Bank shares fell 1.7 per cent on Wednesday, while Reliance Industries declined 0.4 per cent. Trent dropped 1.4 per cent, extending weakness after plunging 8.6 per cent in the previous session amid concerns over intensifying competition in the retail segment.The drag from large-cap stocks was also evident earlier in the week, when HDFC Bank and Reliance Industries — the two heaviest constituents on the indices — fell 1.5 per cent and 4.3 per cent, respectively, amplifying benchmark losses.Dr V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Investments, said recent market movements lacked clear direction, with a few mega stocks disproportionately influencing overall trends. “For instance, yesterday despite positive institutional buying Nifty drifted down by 71 points, mainly due to sharp declines in two stocks — Reliance and HDFC Bank. The large volumes in these two stocks in the derivative and cash markets indicate activity associated with the settlement day. In other words, the sharp dips in these stocks have nothing to do with their fundamentals; it is more technical in nature,” he said, as quoted ET.Global risk appetite was further shaken by political turmoil in Venezuela and uncertainty surrounding its petroleum reserves. Market sentiment turned cautious after a controversial US military operation on January 3 led to the capture of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, and their transfer to the United States to face criminal charges. Maduro remains in custody in New York.The developments have heightened broader geopolitical and policy-related anxieties. “Going forward, there is scope for high volatility caused by events and news,” Vijayakumar said, adding that “Trump tweets and actions can always influence the market. Another important event that investors should closely watch is a possible Supreme Court verdict on Trump tariffs very soon. If the verdict goes against the reciprocal tariffs, it will create huge volatility in stock markets. ”Indian equities also tracked declines across Asian markets, where shares retreated as investors assessed the fallout from the Venezuela crisis and uncertainty over global energy supplies. Japanese equities weighed on regional sentiment after China announced a ban on exports of dual-use items to Japan that can be used for military purposes, following remarks by Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi on Taiwan.The cautious tone across global markets spilled over into domestic trading, reinforcing the downward bias in Indian equities despite some support in commodity-linked stocks after an overnight rally in industrial metals.Technical indicators suggest the recent decline reflects a broader corrective or consolidation phase rather than a breakdown in the longer-term trend, though near-term volatility remains elevated.Jaykrishna Gandhi, Head–Business Development–Institutional Equities at Emkay Global, noted that since 1991 the Nifty 50 has seen seven major bullish cycles, typically followed by corrective phases. He said that post-2009, corrections have largely shifted from sharp price declines to time-wise consolidations, reflecting improved structural strength.According to Gandhi, the index has “recently completed a ~1–1.5-year time correction, which historically has been followed by the resumption of a bullish trend,” with upside potential seen “up to 28,500, with positional support band at 25,500–25,300.”On the sectoral front, he highlighted strength in pharmaceuticals, saying “Nifty Pharma has confirmed a breakout from an ‘inverted head and shoulder’ pattern, indicating bullish continuation with upside potential toward 24,000–24,500,” while adding that the bullish bias remains intact “above 23,500.”However, near-term signals point to choppiness. Anand James, Chief Market Strategist at Geojit Investments, said, “A strong close on Friday near the upper bollinger band suggests continuation of upside momentum. Oscillators are accommodative as well.” At the same time, he cautioned that “VIX being near record indicates potential for rise in volatility,” underscoring the risk of sharp swings despite a broadly constructive technical backdrop.","The BSE Sensex has shed over 1,144 points in the past three sessions.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground.Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change, too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

That’s set to happen around the same time as its initial public offering, he said.The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said. “Second, strategically we want to ensure that we are top of mind with shopkeepers, with big manufacturers, and we maintain our relative market share.”Lightspeed Venture Partners-backed Udaan is among startups trying to tap the rapid growth of India’s economy and consumer market, while meeting investor demands for profitability. Udaan, which at its peak employed thousands, joined fellow Indian startups in slashing jobs last year and tightening internal controls and compliance. It now has about 1,800 staff, and Gupta didn’t specify if further job cuts are needed.Corporate governance lapses at Indian online tutoring firm Byju’s, once the country’s top startup with a valuation of $22 billion, shone a light at unique challenges faced by founders in the South Asian nation and drove companies to be more diligent.“We continue to move towards more professionalized management, professionalized board and also institutionalized shareholders as we go towards public markets,” Gupta said.Udaan is yet to decide whether it will list in India or overseas. It was valued at more than $3 billion in a 2021 funding round, and was in talks to raise $400 million, Business Standard reported in September.

Space sector start-up Sisir Radar to develop SAR on L/P band SAR,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/space-sector-start-up-sisir-radar-to-develop-sar-on-l/p-band-sar/articleshow/104558111.cms,"CHENNAI: Space sector startup, Sisir Radar Private Ltd has hit success at the prestigious iDEX DefSpace Challenge with its projects for development of “L/P band Continuous Wave SAR (synthetic aperture radar) payload for LEO Small Satellites” and “Unfurlable, Electronically Steering Antenna for L/P band SAR payload” for Indian Air Force (IAF), said a top company official.The company is promoted by former Director at the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) Tapan Misra and the brains behind the Indian space agency’s RISAT series of SAR satellites as well as the Dual Frequency SAR on the Chandrayaan 2 orbiter that is currently circling the moon.""A grant of Rs 3 crore is also there for development of the products,"" Misra told IANS.Synthetic Aperture Radar or SAR is a special kind of imaging radar technology that can provide extremely accurate high resolution imagery of the terrain through clouds, smoke and dust even in pitch dark conditions. SAR imagery provides much higher resolution than other forms of remote sensing technology such as hyperspectral and multispectral. SAR is a critical technology for strategic reconnaissance and planning as well as for disaster management.According to Misra, winning the challenge in just over a year of floating the company is a major booster.He said L and P band SAR have an advantage over other frequencies (like X band) when it comes to penetration capabilities through rain, clouds, foliage and vegetation in a tropical country like India, and underground penetration capabilities in dry terrain.Continuing further, he said the L band SAR will provide 1 metre resolution, spotlight resolution in Stripmap mode. The current industry standard is 5-10 metre in L band. Misra said both the L and P band will operate simultaneously from a satellite borne SAR. Recently, Sisir Radar successfully developed and tested the world’s highest resolution L-Band SAR fitted on a drone. With 0.2 metre resolution, this is by far the highest L band SAR in the world, he said.","Space sector startup, Sisir Radar Private Ltd has hit success at the prestigious iDEX DefSpace Challenge.

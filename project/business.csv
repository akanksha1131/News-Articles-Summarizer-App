Top stock market recommendations:Nifty has hit its initial target of 25050 – 25250 from the point it reversed after closing above 24600. With index closing near to its 4 week highs, tailwind momentum is likely to push it to the next target of 25250 on the upside while dips below 24985 are set to get bought into with support seen at 24850.After dropping over 5% from its recent highs, Bank Nifty has shown some short covering since the start of this week after the gap up opening on Monday. Any closing above 55800 is likely to set the toner for further bullishness on the index while a retest of 55500 – 55550 is likely to act as buy on dip for the index for a 3-4% rally unfolding from current levels.The stock of Godawari Power and Ispat Limited had been trading in a range since last few months and has given a highest close in calendar year 2025 yesterday with very strong volumes.

(Disclaimer: Recommendations and views on the stock market and other asset classes given by experts are their own. These opinions do not represent the views of The Times of India)

Gold price prediction today:Gold prices on MCX are currently trading around ₹99,300, showing signs of stabilization after recent declines. The short-term structure on the charts suggests that a Buy on Dips strategy may be favored, especially near the ₹99,000 pivot support zone, with a stop-loss placed at ₹98,600.Technical Setup Overview:1. Pivot Points & Support Zone:• Daily Pivot stands at ₹99,074, with immediate support near ₹99,000.• Stronger support lies at ₹98,743 (S1) and ₹98,182 (S2).• On the higher side, resistance levels are visible at ₹99,970 (R2) and ₹1,00,531 (R3).2. Bollinger Bands – Price Stabilization:Gold recently tested the lower Bollinger band and has now started consolidating near the mid-band. This reflects fading downside pressure, with scope for a bounce if momentum sustains above the pivot levels.3. Momentum Indicators – RSI & MACD:• RSI is currently near 48, recovering from oversold territory, indicating renewed buying strength.• MACD is turning positive with a crossover near the signal line, suggesting improving bullish momentum in the intraday timeframe.4. ADX – Trend Strength:The ADX reading near 24 reflects that the recent downtrend is losing steam, while directional indicators (DI+) are catching up. This hints at the possibility of a near-term trend reversal towards the upside.5. Volume Action:Recent green volume bars indicate accumulation at lower levels, supporting the case for a buy-on-dips approach.Intraday Trade View:• Strategy: Buy on Dips• Entry Zone: ₹99,000 – ₹99,050• Stop-Loss: ₹98,600• Upside Targets:• First Target: ₹99,750 (R2 resistance)• Second Target: ₹1,00,300 – ₹1,00,530 (R3 resistance)• Bias: Bullish above ₹99,000; weakness resumes only if price closes below ₹98,600.Conclusion:With RSI recovering, MACD turning positive, and prices holding above the key pivot support of ₹99,000, the technical setup favors a buy on dips strategy for intraday traders. If gold sustains above ₹99,750, it could open the path towards ₹1,00,500+ in the short term.","Gold rates have been stabilizing and analysts are eyeing a buy on dips strategy.

Stock market today: Nifty50 and BSE Sensex , the Indian equity benchmark indices, tanked in trade on Friday. While Nifty50 went below 24,900, BSE Sensex ended almost 700 points down. Nifty50 closed the day at 24,870.10, down 214 points or 0.85%. BSE Sensex ended at 81,306.85, down 694 points or 0.85%.The stock market ended its six-day positive streak, as investors exhibited caution before Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's speech at the Jackson Hole symposium and anticipated new US tariffs on Indian products, alongside other factors affecting market sentiment.Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Investments Limited says, “The Indian equity market closed in the red today, ending a six-session winning streak and erasing gains accumulated over the past three days. Investor sentiment turned cautious ahead of the US Fed Chair’s speech at the Jackson Hole symposium, which is expected to provide critical insights into the global liquidity outlook and future interest rate trajectory. The US using trade tariffs on India as a strategic tool in its stance against Russia has raised near-term concerns among institutional investors. However, strong domestic indicators offer support: the PMI has hit a record high and recently proposed indirect tax reliefs are expected to boost consumption, underscoring India’s economic resilience.""Investors remained reserved before US Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's address at the Fed's annual Jackson Hole conference. Market participants seek information about whether the US central bank will reduce rates by 25 basis points in September as anticipated. Expectations for a rate reduction have decreased following the Fed's July meeting minutes, which revealed disagreements among policymakers.Reduced US interest rates generally increase the attractiveness of emerging markets like India, but current uncertainty has affected market confidence.IT stocks, which had increased by 3% over the past three sessions, declined by 0.6% Friday.The additional 25% tariff on Indian exports announced by US President Donald Trump is set to take effect August 27. These duties could increase the total levies on certain exports to 50%, representing some of the highest rates imposed on any US trade partner.""The headwinds for the market from Trump tariffs will weigh on markets constraining the rally of the last six days,"" said VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Investments. Vijayakumar cautioned that the implemented tariffs could impact India's growth beyond the currently projected 20-30 basis points.Following six consecutive days of gains, the markets witnessed profit-booking, particularly affecting financial and IT sectors, leading to declines across major sector indices, according to an ET report.During the preceding six-day positive streak, the Nifty and Sensex recorded gains of 2.4% and 2.2% respectively, supported by positive sentiment from GST revisions and an improved S&P sovereign rating.The session saw prominent banks including HDFC Bank and ICICI Bank decline by more than 1%. Among sectors, pharmaceutical and consumer durables segments showed resilience, maintaining positive territory whilst others declined.International institutional investors continued to reduce their positions, selling Rs 31,889 crore across eight sectors in early August, with financial and IT sectors seeing significant outflows. Their total equity sales reached Rs 20,976 crore during this period, following July's exit trend and raising 2023's net outflows to approximately Rs 1.2 lakh crore.On August 13, Jefferies reported that foreign portfolio investment levels in India have reached their lowest point in a decade. Despite domestic investments providing some protection against market decline, the firm advised that any upward movements might be short-lived.The Nifty's upward movement stalled near 25,153, reaching Geojit's short-term targets. Anand James, Chief Market Strategist at the firm, indicated that current technical indicators lack the force needed for further advances, although a significant decline appears unlikely.At Kotak Securities, Head of Equity Research Shrikant Chouhan observed market uncertainty following a higher opening. He identified key support levels at 25,000/81,700 and 24,950/81,500, with resistance at 25,150/82,300 and 25,250/82,500. He warned that movement below 24,850/81,200 could trigger negative sentiment.Regarding the Bank Nifty, Chouhan noted an ""inside body"" formation, suggesting potential upward movement to 56,200–56,500 if it crosses 56,000, while a decline below 55,500 could lead to levels of 55,350–55,000.","Nifty50 closed the day at 24,870.10, down 214 points or 0.85%.

US-India trade: Tariffs to hit leather sector; Kolkata exporters pondering ‘Made in Europe’ question,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/us-india-trade-tariffs-to-hit-leather-sector-kolkata-exporters-pondering-made-in-europe-question/articleshow/123475736.cms,"India’s leather industry, a vital labour-intensive sector with exports worth $4.1 billion, has been hit hard by US President Donald Trump’s decision to impose a 25% tariff on imports from India. The move, coupled with an additional 25% tariff on Russian oil purchases from 27 August 2025, is expected to deepen the crisis exporters are facing.Government data shows India exported nearly $4.1 billion worth of leather and leather products between April 2024 and February 2025, with the US accounting for $870 million. The American market makes up around 20% of India’s overall leather exports.Kolkata, one of the country’s key hubs for leather goods, faces the sharpest impact as West Bengal alone contributes 50% of India’s exports in this sector. Out of 2,020 tanneries nationwide, 538 operate in the state, which also houses 230 leather footwear units and 436 leather goods units, according to an ET report.According to experts, the sudden spike in duties has left them paralysed.Ramesh Juneja, vice chairman of the Council for Leather Exports, explained the uncertainty saying, “The industry is in a wait-and-watch mode. We are unable to offer any discounts to buyers either.Right now, we are just waiting for some clarity to emerge. Last year, the leather industry did Rs 50,000 crore business in leather and leather product exports and footwear. The US market is a significant geography for us. ”Industry leaders further warned that the tariff structure will make Indian products far less competitive. “If it sticks to where it is now, we will have about an 8.5% MFN tax; 25% would be the reciprocal tax, and then the 25% extra tariff for the oil trade with Russia. This is going to have an impact on the price and cost at which the American importer imports the product from this country,” Arjun Mukund Kulkarni, president of the Indian Leather Products Association (ILPA) told ET.He also added that the shock will ripple into European markets as well, as Kolkata made products are sold to the Europe which then sells them to America.“So, it is going to be a challenge, and we will have to figure out ways and means around this situation,"" Kulkarni noted.Exporters are already considering workarounds, such as partial production in Europe, ET reported.“A lot of people are thinking on these lines, and it could then be labelled as a ‘Made in Europe’ product, or from any other country where the final production takes place before being sold to the US. So, people are looking at such ideas where the final product can have a ‘Made in Europe’ stamp,” Kulkarni said.The footwear category is expected to suffer the most, given that it represents 40% of leather products worldwide.Kanishk Maheshwari, co-founder and managing director of Primus Partners India, highlighted the scale of the problem saying, “In 2024-25, leather footwear exports to the US were close to $500 million, which had been growing steadily over the last four years. With this new tariff, a pair of shoes that landed at $100 in US retail will now face almost 10 times more duty (from 5-8% to 50% now) and add an extra $50 to the price, while Vietnamese or Indonesian footwear competes at a duty of just 19-20%. This cost gap alone explains why US buyers are already pivoting orders away from the Agra and Kanpur clusters.”Although Vietnam, Indonesia and China also face tariffs, theirs remain significantly lower, Vietnam at 20%, China at 30%, and Bangladesh at 35%.“Only India and Brazil are subject to a 50% US tariff. This has instantly wiped the competitiveness that India had worked to build through various schemes like rebates under RoDTEP and various export incentives.

Kulkarni calls for urgent intervention, “The government needs to come up with some revolutionary ideas, subsidising or supporting the industry. The Brazilian government, for instance, has reached out and is giving subsidies. The Indian government will also have to think about something to keep the exporters afloat amid such high tariffs. ”","India exported nearly $4.1 billion worth of leather and leather products between April 2024 and February 2025.

Misleading advertisements: CCPA slaps Rs 3 lakh fine on VLCC; consumers cautioned on instant weight-loss claims,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/misleading-advertisements-ccpa-slaps-rs-3-lakh-fine-on-vlcc-consumers-cautioned-on-instant-weight-loss-claims/articleshow/123469618.cms,"Image source/Agencies

NEW DELHI: The Central Consumer Protection Authority (CCPA) has imposed a penalty of Rs 3 lakh on VLCC Limited for publishing misleading advertisements related to slimming treatments using the US-FDA approved CoolSculpting procedure.The Department of Consumer Affairs on Saturday said that the action was taken after it was found that VLCC’s advertisements made exaggerated claims of drastic weight loss and slimming treatments, as reported by news agency PTI.In a press release issued by CCPA, it was stated that VLCC had promoted CoolSculpting and similar procedures as a permanent weight-loss solution. Some of its advertisements carried claims such as “Lose up to 600g and 7 cm in 1 session,” “Drop 1 Size in 1 session permanently” and “Drop one size in one hour.”""On examination, it was found that VLCC was making exaggerated claims of drastic weight loss and inch reduction within a single session, which went far beyond the actual approval granted to the CoolSculpting machine, thereby misleading consumers,"" the statement read.The regulator clarified that CoolSculpting is approved only for localized fat reduction in specific body areas such as the upper arm, thigh, abdomen, flank, back fat, banana roll and submental area.The procedure, developed by Zeltiq Aesthetics, is meant only for individuals with a Body Mass Index (BMI) of 30 or less. Therefore, it is not a weight-loss treatment.The CCPA also noted that clinical trials submitted to the US-FDA included only Caucasian, Hispanic and African American participants, with no Indian or Asian representation. Further, the US-FDA has not given any endorsement for the use of CoolSculpting in India.""By omitting these critical details, VLCC misled consumers in violation of the Consumer Protection Act, 2019,"" CCPA observed while imposing penalty.Along with the monetary penalty, CCPA has directed VLCC to follow strict guidelines in future advertisements. These include prominently disclosing the body areas where the procedure works, clarifying that it is not a weight-loss treatment, informing consumers about its limited testing and removing contract clauses that seek to escape legal liability.The regulator also warned all beauty clinics, wellness centres, and service providers using CoolSculpting machines in India to comply with these directions or face strict action, including penalties and legal proceedings.Earlier, CCPA had imposed a similar fine of Rs 3 lakh on Kaya Limited for misleading advertisements on CoolSculpting treatments. The company has since complied with the order.The authority said the latest order underscores its commitment to protecting consumers from exaggerated and false claims in the health, wellness and beauty industry. Consumers were also advised to exercise caution and not fall for advertisements promising instant or permanent weight loss through CoolSculpting.","The Central Consumer Protection Authority (CCPA) has imposed a penalty of Rs 3 lakh on VLCC Limited.

The Menendez brothers are set to appear for parole board hearings this week after spending nearly 30 years in prison for killing their parents.Erik and Lyle Menendez were convicted of first-degree murder and were sentenced to life in prison in 1996 for fatally shooting their father, Jose Menendez, and mother, Kitty Menendez, in their Beverly Hills mansion in 1989.The brothers, now 57 and 54, were sentenced to life without the possibility of parole. Lyle and Erik Menendez were the sons of Jose Menendez, who was a Cuban-American business executive who once held a senior position at RCA Record.In May, their sentences were reduced by a Los Angeles judge to 50 years to life, making them eligible for parole under California's youth offender law because they were under the age of 26 when they committed their crimes.While defense attorneys argued the brothers acted out of self-defense after years of sexual abuse by their father, prosecutors said the brothers sought a multimillion-dollar inheritance.A panel of parole hearing officers will evaluate the brothers individually. Erik Menendez will have his hearing on Thursday morning, followed by Lyle Menendez on Friday. They will appear over videoconference from prison in San Diego.The board will determine if the brothers present an “unreasonable risk of danger to society” upon release, taking into account their criminal record, motive for the crime, expressions of remorse, conduct in prison, and future plans, the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation said.The Menendez brothers' appellate attorney, Mark Geragos, has said their parole hearings should be about redemption and not about relitigating the facts of the case.Several family members came forward to express forgiveness and advocate for their freedom from prison. These relatives indicated they had moved past the trauma of the murders and believed the brothers deserved a second chance after nearly 30 years of incarceration.","Erik and Lyle Menendez were convicted of first-degree murder in 1996.

'Sovereign Brazil’



Exporters get BNDES support







Brazil’s state development bank, BNDES, on Friday announced a 10 billion reais ($1.85 billion) credit line to help companies affected by steep US tariffs. The facility is divided into funding for general operating expenses and exploring new export markets, complementing a 30 billion reais package unveiled earlier this month by the Brazilian government.According to BNDES, companies of all sizes with products subject to any level of US levies can access the credit line, reported Reuters.The move follows the government’s broader 30 billion reais ($5.5 billion) support plan, aimed at exporters impacted by the 50% tariffs imposed by US president Donald Trump on several Brazilian goods.Other measures in the government’s plan, dubbed “Sovereign Brazil,” include postponing tax charges, providing 5 billion reais ($930,000) in tax credits to small and medium-sized enterprises through 2026, and expanding insurance coverage for cancelled orders. The program also encourages public procurement of goods that cannot be exported to the US, providing an alternative market for affected companies.Brazilian president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva emphasised the need for calm and innovation during economic crises. “We cannot be scared, nervous and anxious when there is a crisis. A crisis is for us to create new things,” he said. “In this case, what is unpleasant is that the reasons given to impose sanctions against Brazil do not exist.”The US tariffs have been linked by Trump to the judicial situation of former president Jair Bolsonaro, who is currently under house arrest, adding a political dimension to the trade dispute.The combined credit lines from BNDES and the federal government aim to provide Brazilian companies with liquidity, flexibility, and opportunities to explore alternative markets, helping them offset the impact of US tariffs.","Brazil's state development bank, BNDES, announces 10 billion reais ($1.85 billion) credit line to help companies affected by steep US tariffs.

Powell warns of uncertainties due to Trump's tariffs

Trump a strong critic of Powell

US Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell indicated on Friday that a potential rate reduction could occur during September's central bank meeting. However, he maintained a balanced stance, refraining from making definitive commitments about interest rate cuts. His comments acknowledged mounting concerns about employment conditions whilst emphasising that inflation risks continue to persist.Delivering a speech at the Jackson Hole Economic Policy Symposium, Powell said, “Risks to inflation are tilted to the upside and risks to employment to the downside, a challenging situation when our goals, our intention like this, our framework calls for us to balance both sides of our dual mandate. Our policy rate is now 100 basis points closer to neutral than it was a year ago, and the stability of the unemployment rate and other labor market measures allows us to proceed carefully as we consider changes to our policy stance. ”“Nonetheless, with policy and restrictive territory, the baseline outlook and the shifting balance of risks may warrant adjusting our policy stance. Policy is not on a preset course. FOMC members will make these decisions based solely on their assessment of the data and its implications for the economic outlook and the balance of risks, we will never deviate from that approach,” he said.“While the labor market appears to be in balance, it is a curious kind of balance that results from a marked slowing in both the supply of and demand for workers. This unusual situation suggests that downside risks to employment are rising, and if those risks materialize, they can do so quickly in the form of sharply higher layoffs and rising unemployment,” Powell said.“At the same time, GDP growth has slowed, notably in the first half of this year, to a pace of 1.2%, roughly half the 2.5% pace in 2024. The decline in growth has largely reflected a slowdown in consumer spending, as with the labor market. Some of the slowing in GDP likely reflects slower growth of supply or potential output.""We continue to believe that monetary policy must be forward looking and consider the lags its effects on the economy. For this reason, our policy actions depend on the economic outlook and the balance of risks to that outlook,"" he said.“This year, the economy has faced new challenges, significantly higher tariffs across our trading partners are remaking the global trading system. Tighter immigration policy has led to an abrupt slowdown in labor force growth over the longer run, changes in tax, spending and regulatory policies may also have important implications for economic growth and productivity. There is significant uncertainty about where all of these policies will eventually settle and what their lasting effects on the economy will be,” Powell cautioned.“Changes in trade and immigration policies are affecting both demand and supply in this environment. Distinguishing cyclical developments from trend or structural developments is difficult. This distinction is critical, because monetary policy can work to stabilize cyclical fluctuations, but can do little to alter structural changes,” he said.“When I appeared at this podium one year ago. The economy was at an inflection point. Our policy rate had stood at five and a quarter to five and a half percent for more than a year. That restrictive policy stance was appropriate to help bring down inflation and to foster a sustainable balance between aggregate demand and supply, inflation had moved much closer to our objective, and the labor market had cooled from its formerly overheated state upside. Risks to inflation had diminished, but the unemployment rate had increased by almost a full percentage point, a development that historically has not occurred outside of recessions,” Powell said at the start of his speech.“Over the subsequent three Federal Open Market Committee meetings, we recalibrated our policy stance, setting the stage for the labor market to remain in balance near maximum employment over the past year,” he said.This is Powell’s last Jackson Hole speech as the US Federal Reserve chairperson. His tenure concludes in May 2026.The Federal Reserve, scheduled to convene its next policy meeting in mid-September, has maintained interest rates between 4.25 percent and 4.50 percent since their last decrease in December.The decision to keep rates steady was influenced by the strong labour market performance, as officials assessed the impact of Trump's comprehensive tariffs on America's economy.According to analysts, increased import tariffs could lead to price increases. The Federal Reserve generally maintains elevated interest rates as a strategy to control inflation effectively.The Federal Reserve chairperson's keynote address at last year's Jackson Hole Economic Policy Symposium suggested potential interest rate reductions, but experts caution the situation is less clear at present.""The Fed is in a tough position as inflation remains above target and downside risks to the labor market are intensifying,"" said Ryan Sweet, chief US economist at Oxford Economics according to an AFP report.US President Donald Trump has openly expressed his criticism of Powell, consistently stating that the Federal Reserve chairman has been ""too late"" in reducing interest rates whilst labelling him a ""numbskull"" and ""moron.""Trump criticised Powell regarding the Federal Reserve's headquarters refurbishment in Washington, suggesting that excessive expenses could warrant the central banker's dismissal.Trump later abandoned this stance but recently demanded Fed governor Lisa Cook's resignation, citing allegations of mortgage fraud.In response, Cook issued a statement declaring that she had ""no intention of being bullied to step down"" whilst noting her commitment to addressing questions about her financial records.","US Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell indicated on Friday that a potential rate reduction could occur during September's central bank meeting.

He said the current balance in the labour market allows policymakers to “proceed carefully” on rate changes.

Nvidia chief executive Jensen Huang said the company is holding talks with the Trump administration over a potential new semiconductor for China, even as Washington maintains tight curbs on advanced chip sales citing national security.During a visit to Taiwan to meet Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp (TSMC), Nvidia’s key manufacturing partner, Huang was asked about reports of a new “B30A” graphics processing unit (GPU) aimed at Chinese artificial intelligence data centres, AP reported. TSMC is the world’s largest chip maker.“I'm offering a new product to China for ... AI data centres, the follow-on to H20,” Huang said. “But that’s not our decision to make. It’s up to, of course, the United States government. And we're in dialogue with them, but it's too soon to know.”The B30A would be based on Nvidia’s Blackwell technology and is said to run at about half the speed of the company’s flagship B300 chips. Top-end Nvidia processors remain barred from China under US restrictions that seek to limit Beijing’s access to advanced computing power for military and AI applications.Huang praised the Trump administration for recently clearing the sale of Nvidia’s H20 chips to China, which had been halted in April. Approval was granted with a condition that Nvidia pay a 15% tax to the US government on such sales. Rival Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) was asked to pay the same levy on exports of its MI380 chips to China.The approval was part of wider trade talks in which Washington and Beijing agreed to scale back some non-tariff measures. China granted additional permits for exports of rare earth magnets to the US, while Washington removed restrictions on chip design software and jet engines. Following Huang’s lobbying efforts, Nvidia was also allowed to resume H20 sales to Chinese customers.Asked about the tax condition, Huang declined to comment directly but said Nvidia valued the chance to sell H20 chips to China. He also rejected suggestions that such sales carried security risks for the US.“We have made very clear and put to rest that H20 has no security backdoors. There are no such things. There never has. And so hopefully the response that we've given to the Chinese government will be sufficient,” Huang said. He added that Nvidia was also in talks with Beijing to assure regulators about the product’s integrity.China’s Cyberspace Administration had recently posted a notice online raising what it called “serious security issues” in Nvidia’s chips. Citing US AI experts, it alleged the processors included “mature tracking and location and remote shutdown technologies.” Nvidia was asked to clarify these claims and provide documentation.Huang said the company was surprised by the accusations. “As you know, they requested and urged us to secure licenses for the H20s for some time. And I’ve worked quite hard to help them secure the licenses. And so hopefully this will be resolved,” he said.Reports in Chinese media have suggested authorities were also angered by comments from US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, who argued that Washington’s policy was to limit China’s access to cutting-edge chips.“We don't sell them our best stuff,” Lutnick told CNBC. “Not our second-best stuff. Not even our third best, but I think fourth best is where we've come out that we're cool.”China’s ruling Communist Party has prioritised self-reliance in advanced technology but continues to rely heavily on foreign semiconductor know-how.",Nvidia chief executive Jensen Huang said the company is holding talks with the Trump administration over a potential new semiconductor for China.

"The US and EU release a bare-bones account of their trade deal, but it's a work in progress",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/the-us-and-eu-release-a-bare-bones-account-of-their-trade-deal-but-its-a-work-in-progress/articleshow/123443135.cms,"BRUSSELS: American and European Union officials released a bare-bones account Thursday of their trade deal that imposes a 15% import tax on 70% of European goods exported to the United States, but they left blank key areas such as wine and spirits as well as steel and indicated that talks would continue on those and a slew of other important sectors.The two sides said the document was only ""a first step in a process that can be further expanded to cover additional areas."" They are dealing with the vast range of goods traded between the two economies in what is the largest bilateral trading relationship in the world, involving $2 trillion in annual trans-Atlantic business.The 3 1/2-page text represents a political commitment and is not legally binding. It contrasts with the typical format for trade agreements, which can be hundreds of pages long and carry legal force.The key provisions are the 15% tariff on most EU goods, a zero rate on U.S. cars and other industrial goods exported to the 27-member EU, and a range of exceptions to the 15% rate for aircraft and aircraft parts, generic pharmaceuticals and pharmaceutical ingredients, with other sectors to be added for goods crucial to each other's economies. Those goods would face lower tariffs from before President Donald Trump's tariff onslaught.""The EU has agreed to open its $20 Trillion market,"" Trump's commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick, said on X. ""The second largest in the world behind the great USA.""He said the deal was ""a major win for American workers, US industries, and our national security. Tariffs should be one of America's favorite words.""European officials have had to defend the deal against dismay from businesses and member governments at the higher tariffs and criticism that the EU gave away too much. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen sold the deal as granting quick relief from the even higher U.S. tariff on EU cars of 27.5% and as opening the way for further negotiations that could exclude more goods from the 15% tariffs. The deal provides that the lower tariff on cars would apply retroactively from Aug. 1 if the EU can introduce legislation to implement its part of the deal by then, which EU officials say they will do.""Faced with a challenging situation, we have delivered for our member states and industry and restored clarity and coherence to transatlantic trade,"" von der Leyen said. ""This is not the end of the process.""The chief EU trade negotiator, Maros Sefcovic, echoed those sentiments. ""The alternative was a trade war with sky high tariffs ... it builds confidence. It brings stability,"" he said.Economists say higher tariffs slow economic growth and will be reflected in higher consumer prices.One category of goods not excluded from tariffs on EU goods was wine and spirits, which had enjoyed zero tariffs on both ends since a 1997 trade deal. Sefcovic, said EU officials had not won an exemption ""yet"" but hoped to in future talks and that ""doors are not closed forever"" on that issue.That means American distillers face zero tariffs in Europe the short term, but also the possibility of EU retaliation down the line, said Chris Swonger, president and CEO of the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States. ""Without a permanent return to zero-for-zero tariffs on spirits, American distillers do not have the certainty to plan for future export and job growth without the fear of retaliatory tariffs returning,"" Swonger said in a statement.The EU has suspended retaliatory tariffs on US goods including wine and spirits until Feb. 5, 2026.Proposals to exempt a certain amount of EU steel imports, known as a tariff rate quota, have been left unresolved pending more talks.The 15% tariff is much higher than tariff levels on both sides from before Trump began imposing his tariffs, when they averaged in the low single digits. The tariffs are paid on the U.S. end, either absorbed by American businesses importing the goods, lowering their profits, or passed on to U.S. consumers in the form of higher prices at the cash register.The deal also includes nonbinding EU commitments to purchase $750 billion in U.S. energy and for EU companies to invest $600 billion in the U.S. In both cases, the money would come from private companies and is based on assessment by the European Commission on what companies were planning to spend.",The deal imposes a 15% import tax on 70% of European goods exported to the United States.

Tariffs aren't keeping Walmart from attracting shoppers and outpacing Target,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/tariffs-arent-keeping-walmart-from-attracting-shoppers-and-outpacing-target/articleshow/123437135.cms,"FILE - Shoppers walk from the Walmart store, Aug. 14, 2025, in Manchester, N.H. (AP Photo/Charles Krupa, file)

NEW YORK: Walmart Inc. powered through an uncertain economic environment and tariff concerns to deliver solid second-quarter financial results Thursday, showing it keeps pulling in shoppers and outpacing peers like Target.The nation's largest retailer reported a 4.6% quarterly increase in comparable sales - those coming from established stores and online channels. Company executives said Walmart was attracting customers, particularly higher-income shoppers who may have avoided its stores in the past, with fast deliveries, grocery discounts and trendier clothes.The company, based in Bentonville, Arkansas, also raised its annual profit and sales outlook.Walmart's results differed notably from those of rival Target, which on Wednesday reported another quarter of comparable sales declines. The Minneapolis-based company has struggled to find its footing as customers defect to Walmart and other stores where they think they will find greater bargains and increasingly, the same or better merchandise.Target's board of directors named a 20-year company veteran on Wednesday to succeed CEO Brian Cornell when he steps down after 11 years in early 2026.Walmart said its profitable e-commerce operations, advertising revenue and selection of products with high profit margins have given it flexibility to absorb extra costs from the range of tariffs President Donald Trump has put on foreign products.Walmart CEO Doug McMillon told investors Thursday that the impact of tariffs also has been gradual enough to mute changes in consumer spending behavior. When the discounter raised prices on certain items, it's observed lower- and middle-income customers trading down to lower-priced options or foregoing purchases, he said.The company will continue to see its costs increase as it replenishes inventory at post-tariff price levels, McMillion said.""We're doing what we said we would do,"" he said. ""We're keeping our prices as low as we can for as long as we can. Our merchants have been creative and acted with urgency to avoid what would have been additional pressure for our customers and members.""A growing list of companies, including Procter & Gamble, E.lf. Cosmetics, Black & Decker and Ralph Lauren, told investors in recent weeks that they planned to or already had raised prices because of tariffs, though modestly.None of that has derailed consumer spending. Shoppers spent at a healthy pace in July, particularly at the nation's auto dealerships, as signs emerged that President Donald Trump's trade policies were taking a toll on jobs.Some of that spending may have been shoppers buying furniture and other imported items to get ahead of expected price increases, analysts said.On Tuesday, Home Depot, the nation's largest home improvement retailer, reported improved sales during its latest quarter as consumers remained focused on smaller projects. Like Walmart, Home Depot's performance missed Wall Street's expectations.The Atlanta-based company also said shoppers should expect modest price increases in some categories as a result of additional costs from tariffs, which are taxes on imports. Home Depot reported comparable sales increase of 1.4% in line with what home improvement rival Lowe's reported on Wednesday.But it's Walmart that serves as a barometer of spending given its outsized power in American retailing. The company maintains that 90% of US households rely on Walmart for a range of products, and more than 150 million customers shop on its website or in its stores every week.Walmart said in May that prices had started to increase in late April and got higher in May. But it said Thursday that it had introduced 7,400 price rollbacks, or temporary discounts, across the aisles in the latest quarter.The company said it earned $7.03 billion, or 88 cents per share, for the three-month period that ended July 31. That compares with $4.50 billion, or 56 cents per share, a year ago.Sales rose nearly 5% to $177.4 billion. Walmart's 4.6% growth in US comparable sales during the second quarter was slightly higher than its first-quarter gain of 4.5%. Groceries and health and wellness items fueled the growth, the company said.Global e-commerce sales rose 25%, above the 22% growth in the first quarter.The retailer said roughly one-third of deliveries from its US stores in recent weeks were orders requesting delivery in three hours or less, and 20% of those orders made it to customers in a half-hour or under.Despite Walmart's solid quarter, its stock price was down close to 5% late Thursday morning as its earnings per share came in below what analysts had expected. Analysts were expecting 73 cents per share on sales of $175.93 billion for the quarter, according to FactSet.Per share results, excluding effects of charges related to certain legal matters and from business restructuring, was 68 cents, Walmart said.One $450 million expense was tied to settlements over worker and shopper injury claims, Walmart said. A company spokesperson said the cost per claim was increasing but not the total number.For the year, Walmart raised its per-share estimates to a range of $2.52 to $2.62, up from a previous estimate of $2.50 to $2.60. It said 2025 sales are anticipated to increase 3.75% to 4.75%, more than it projected in May.","The nation's largest retailer reported a 4.6% quarterly increase in comparable sales - those coming from established stores and online channels.

In contrast, Target reported continued comparable sales declines, prompting a leadership change earlier this year.Walmart’s strong e-commerce operations, profitable product mix, and advertising revenue have helped it absorb rising costs from tariffs.

US comparable sales growth of 4.6% was slightly higher than the 4.5% gain in Q1, with groceries and health and wellness items driving momentum. Global e-commerce sales rose 25%, surpassing the 22% growth in the previous quarter.About one-third of US store deliveries were fulfilled within three hours, and 20% within 30 minutes, reflecting Walmart’s operational efficiency. The company’s stock, however, fell nearly 5% late Thursday morning after earnings per share came in slightly below analyst expectations of 73 cents, largely due to $450 million in settlement costs related to worker and shopper injury claims.Walmart forecast current-quarter earnings per share between 58 cents and 60 cents, slightly above analyst expectations of 57 cents.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume.

Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain and boost vendor partnerships ahead of a stock market debut planned for 2025.The Series E round was done via a combination of fresh equity and conversion of debt, the Bangalore-based company said in a statement Thursday. The round was led by M&G Plc and existing investors including Lightspeed Venture Partners and DST Global participated.The round “fully funds our business plan,” Vaibhav Gupta, Udaan co-founder and chief executive officer, said in the statement. “It enables our continued journey of growth and profitability, positioning us well to be public-market ready in the next 12-18 months.”Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, runs an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business, though a very small part of India’s overall retail market, is expected to swell to $150 billion in sales in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co.The startup targets an initial public offering in 2025, though it’s yet to decide whether it will do so in India or overseas, Gupta told Bloomberg News last month.Udaan was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran the company until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021. The other two founders — Amod Malviya and Sujeet Kumar — are board members.","Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain.

The startup has a total of 18 employees and is just opening an office in the city.""What we are showing is that you can build large language models with limited resources,” Raghavan said in a phone interview. ""We are building at a smaller scale and demonstrating that these can be extremely cost and energy efficient so they can be accessed by everyone.""Large language models, like OpenAI’s GPT-4 and Meta Platforms Inc.’s Llama, are powerful AI systems that understand by learning from vast amounts of diverse data from the internet and elsewhere to summarize, translate, and create text, audio and video for a wide range of applications.

Startups will play important role in helping India become 3rd largest economy: CEA Nageswaran,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/startups-will-play-important-role-in-helping-india-become-3rd-largest-economy-cea-nageswaran/articleshow/105332523.cms,"Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Startups will play an important role in helping India become the third largest economy in the world, Chief Economic Advisor ( CEA ) to the Union government V Anantha Nageswaran has said.Nageswaran said that tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country due to improvements in infrastructure and supportive policies of the government, according to a KSUM release.The CEA, during his Leadership Talk on the concluding day of the Huddle Global 2023 organised by the Kerala Startup Mission (KSUM), said that India was the fifth largest economy on course to become the third largest in a few years.""In fact, I will say 7-in-7 is the buzz slogan, that is 7 trillion USD economy in seven years. Seven trillion USD economy size by 2030 is possible if India maintains its present growth trajectory, and in that journey startup entrepreneurs are going to play an important role,"" he is quoted as having said in the release.He was of the view that the active participation of startups in India in developing business models on the foundation of expanding physical and digital infrastructure will continue to generate efficiency, revenue and economic returns for the country.""The last decade has seen an exceptional transformation in the startup landscape in India, which has emerged as the third largest ecosystem globally, with over 1.12 lakh startups presently recognised by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) across 763 districts.""Among them, more than 110 are unicorns with a total valuation of around USD 350 billion,"" he said.The CEA further said that the country ranks second in innovation quality.He said that innovation in India was not just limited to certain sectors as startups were solving problems in 56 industrial sectors, with 13 per cent of them from IT services, nine per cent from health and life sciences, seven per cent from education, five per cent from agriculture and five per cent from food and beverages.Nageswaran also said it was significant that 49 per cent of the startups were from tier-2 and 3 cities which have turned to be game-changers as the business advantages in these locations enable entrepreneurs to operate at lower costs as compared to tier-1 cities.""Apart from improved infrastructure and the government's pro-active policies, the availability of a technically skilled talent pool is a huge advantage for startups to set up and flourish in tier-2 and tier-3 cities,"" he said.He said that historically there was a perception that small towns were difficult places to conduct business.""...but with improved internet penetration, vastly better physical infrastructure, road, rail and air connectivity and supportive government policies, this is no longer true,"" he said.He also noted Kerala's startup journey has been an inspiring one.The CEA said that KSUM has served as the catalyst since its establishment in 2006 to promote change that propelled the state into the forefront of the global startup arena.KSUM is the Kerala government's nodal agency established in 2006 for entrepreneurship development and incubation activities in the state.Nageswaran said that with over 4,000 registered tech startups, 63 incubators and 10 lakh square feet of incubation space, KSUM has not only met its goal of promoting technology-based entrepreneurship but has also earned the distinguished position of being among the world's top business incubators.The November 16-18 fifth edition of Huddle Global, India's biggest beachside startup conclave, was organised by KSUM at Adimalathura beach, near Vizhinjam, here.Attended by around 1,500 delegates, the event displayed sophisticated products from emerging sectors such as robotics, Artificial Intelligence , Machine Learning, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, life sciences, space tech, blockchain, IoT, e-governance, fintech, healthtech, agritech, edutech and SaaS from across the country.","Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran said tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country.

That’s set to happen around the same time as its initial public offering, he said.The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said. “Second, strategically we want to ensure that we are top of mind with shopkeepers, with big manufacturers, and we maintain our relative market share.”Lightspeed Venture Partners-backed Udaan is among startups trying to tap the rapid growth of India’s economy and consumer market, while meeting investor demands for profitability. Udaan, which at its peak employed thousands, joined fellow Indian startups in slashing jobs last year and tightening internal controls and compliance. It now has about 1,800 staff, and Gupta didn’t specify if further job cuts are needed.Corporate governance lapses at Indian online tutoring firm Byju’s, once the country’s top startup with a valuation of $22 billion, shone a light at unique challenges faced by founders in the South Asian nation and drove companies to be more diligent.“We continue to move towards more professionalized management, professionalized board and also institutionalized shareholders as we go towards public markets,” Gupta said.Udaan is yet to decide whether it will list in India or overseas.

How India's GDP has been growing

What SBI report said on savings and investment

Incremental capital output ratio

NEW DELHI: India's gross domestic product (GDP) data for the third quarter (October-December 2022) received a word of caution from the former Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Raghuram Rajan In an interview with news agency PTI, Rajan that India is ""dangerously close"" to the Hindu rate of growth in view of subdued private sector investment, high interest rates and slowing global growth.India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%.Rajan termed this sequential slowdown in growth as ""worrying"".However, a report released by the State Bank of India (SBI) economists on Tuesday dismissed arguments that India is dangerously close to Hindu rate of growth saying such statements are ""ill-conceived, biased and premature"".The term 'Hindu growth rate' was coined by late economist Raj Krishna in 1978 to describe the slow growth in the country.It basically refers to the low pace of economic growth rates during 1950s to 1980s. During this period, the Indian economy averaged 3.5%.A former lecturer at the Delhi School of Economics (DSE), Krishna noted that only if the rate of growth is persistently slow and accompanied by low per-capita GDP, then it will be known as Hindu rate of growth but it has to factor in population growth as well.Before economic reforms of 1991, India's economic growth remained stagnant and low, while per capita income averaged around 1.3%. Krishna termed this low growth situation to be a result of socialist policies of state control and import substitution.However, the economic situation changed when liberalisation, privatisation and globalisation (LPG) reforms came into effect in the year 1991, at a time when India faced balance of payment crisis.Over the years, many economists have strongly opposed the idea of 'Hindu growth rate' and the term never had universal acceptance.The Indian economy plunged into its very first technical recession in FY21 due to the impact of Covid-19 pandemic and the related nationwide lockdowns. GDP shrunk by an unprecedented 23.8% in the first quarter of the financial year 2020-21. However, due to spurt in economic activities in the subsequent quarters, the GDP decline started to narrow.However, if we look at the period before Covid-19 as well, India's growth curve shows a declining trend.From 8.26% in FY17, GDP growth plunged to 3.74% in FY20. Shutdown of economic activities in FY21 in wake of Covid-19 only made matters worse.As lockdowns started to ease and business activities resumed, India's GDP also started rising. In Q1 of FY22, growth jumped to 20.1% mainly on account of low base effect. By the fourth quarter of FY22, growth came down to 4.10%.Similarly, the new financial year 2022-23 brought fresh economic challenges in the form of Russia-Ukraine war that impacted almost all major economies of the world, slowed the pace of growth, pushed inflation to record highs.As a result, the central banks of all advanced economies spurred into action and opted for monetary policy tightening to curb the soaring inflation.With persistently rising interest rates, India's economy grew by 4.4% in Q3 of FY23, as the Centre revised upwards GDP growth for previous year to 9.10% from 8.7% earlier.The report weighed recent GDP numbers against the available data on savings and investments for the past decade and highlighted some interesting points.""Quarterly growth numbers are noisy and should be best avoided for any serious interpretation (on an average, India's GDP growth has witnessed Rs 2 lakh crore upward revision for the 3 year ended FY23),"" the report said.Gross capital formation (GCF) by the government touched a high of 11.8% in 2021-22, up from 10.7% in 2020-21.""This also had a domino effect on private sector investment that jumped from 10 per cent to 10.8% over the same period,"" it said.In fact, Ecowrap added that the trends in GCF to gross output ratio or the plough back of funds for creation of fresh capacity shows that for public administration the ratio attained fresh peak in 2021-22 owing to the emphasis on capital expenditure in recent budgets.At the aggregate level, gross capital formation is supposed to have crossed 32% in 2022-23, the highest level since 2018-19.According to the report, in 2021-22, gross savings have risen to 30% from 29% in 2020-21.""The ratio is supposed to have crossed 31 per cent in 2022-23, the highest since 2018-19. The household savings increased sharply during the pandemic period on account of sharp accretion in financial savings such as deposits,"" said the report by SBI's Economic Research Department.While household financial savings have since then moderated from 15.4% in 2020-21 to 11.1% in 2022-23, savings in physical assets have grown sharply to 11.8% in 2021-22 from 10.7% in 2020-21.The report further analysed Incremental Capital Output ratio (ICOR) -- which measures additional units of capital (investment) needed to produce additional units of output. It said that the ratio has been improving.""ICOR which was 7.5 in FY 12 is now only 3.5 in FY22. Clearly, only half of capital is now needed for next unit of output,"" the report noted.Such reducing ICOR in the current years reflects a relatively increasing efficiency of capital and shows that the economy is on a sound footing, the report said.""From that point of view, future GDP growth rates even at 7% could still mean a decent number by any standards!,"" it added.","India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%.

An employee is entitled for a 50 per cent amount of the last drawn salary as pension.OPS was discontinued by the NDA government in 2003 with effect from April 1, 2004.Under the new pension scheme (NPS), employees contribute 10 per cent of their basic salary towards pension while the government contributes 14 per cent.Governments of Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand have informed the central government/ Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA about their decision to restart OPS for their employees.The government of Punjab on November 18, 2022, issued a notification regarding implementation of OPS for the state government employees who are being covered under NPS. Jharkhand too has decided to revert to OPS.",Former RBI governor Raghuram Rajan has expressed his concern over the decision of some states to restart the old pension scheme.

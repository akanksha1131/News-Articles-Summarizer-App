IndiGo cancellations: On-time performance crashes to 8.5%! Chaos unfolds at airports with over 400 flights cancelled,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/indigo-cancellations-on-time-performance-crashes-to-8-5-chaos-unfolds-at-airports-with-over-400-flights-cancelled/articleshow/125783423.cms,"Massive Outrage Over IndiGo Chaos, Over 600 Flights Cancelled In India's Biggest Aviation Crisis

IndiGo’s operational crisis deepened on Friday as its on-time performance at six major metro airports collapsed to just 8.5%, according to data published on the Civil Aviation Ministry website. The sharp fall became the latest flashpoint in a continuing disruption that has now stretched into its fourth straight day.The airline cancelled all departing flights from Chennai airport until 6pm, according to sources cited by PTI. Alongside, it also suspended all departures from Delhi Airport until midnight, adding to the turmoil for passengers already facing widespread delays and cancellations across the country.This comes barely 24 hours after IndiGo scrapped more than 550 domestic and international flights, far above its usual levels of disruption. Airports remain overwhelmed as passengers report being stranded for days without proper assistance. Scenes of frustration have been visible across terminals, with travellers complaining of no food, no water, vacant counters and missing luggage. Some flights were delayed by more than 12 hours, adding to the congestion at airports such as Pune, Bengaluru, Mumbai, Delhi, Hyderabad and Goa.According to PTI, Friday’s cancellations alone crossed 400. The city-wise breakdown included 118 cancellations in Mumbai, 100 in Bengaluru, 75 in Hyderabad, 35 in Kolkata, 26 in Chennai and 11 in Goa, with several other airports also reporting disruptions. Queues have grown longer by the hour as flyers struggle to rebook tickets or retrieve their baggage, while many complain of having no clarity on when they will be able to travel.With IndiGo accounting for roughly 65% of India’s domestic market, the impact has begun spilling over to other carriers.The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) has now stepped in, requiring IndiGo to submit a detailed roadmap covering pilot hiring, training timelines, roster restructuring and safety assessments. The regulator has also made it mandatory for the airline to file a progress report every 15 days. IndiGo has assured the DGCA that “normalized and stable operations will be fully restored by 10 February 2026.”IndiGo currently operates more than 400 aircraft, runs over 2,300 flights daily, connects over 90 domestic and 45 international destinations, and flew 118 million passengers in FY25. The airline was recently named “Best Airline in India and South Asia” at the 2025 Skytrax Awards.Data submitted to the regulator shows that IndiGo has 2,357 captains and 2,194 first officers available for December. However, its crew requirement has risen sharply since the second phase of the Flight Duty Time Limitations (FDTL) rules came into effect. In November alone, it required 2,422 captains and 2,153 first officers, higher than the October requirement of 2,186 captains and 1,948 first officers. With the updated FDTL norms also limiting the number of night landings per pilot, night operations have faced the hardest hit.On the top of that, the airline also increased its domestic flight count by 6%, from 14,158 in the summer schedule to 15,014 in the winter schedule beginning 26 October. The mismatch between flight capacity and available pilots has resulted in the current crunch, leaving passengers to deal with both mass cancellations and soaring fares.",IndiGo's on-time performance at six major metro airports collapsed to just 8.5%. The airline cancelled all departing flights from Chennai airport until 6pm. It also suspended all departures from Delhi Airport until midnight. This comes barely 24 hours after IndiGo scrapped more than 550 domestic and international flights.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125783765,imgsize-43372,width-400,resizemode-4/indigo.jpg"

Gold price prediction today: Gold prices are exhibiting weakness, says Jateen Trivedi, VP Research Analyst - Commodity and Currency, LKP Securities. Here recommends a sell on rise strategy for investors:Gold futures on MCX traded near ₹1,30,000, showing signs of weakness after failing to sustain above the immediate resistance zone. Price action suggests that momentum is tilting in favor of sellers as the short-term averages flatten and oscillators indicate a lack of bullish conviction. The technical setup supports a sell-on-rise strategy near ₹1,30,400, with a stop-loss at ₹1,31,500 and potential downside targets around ₹1,29,000.Moving Averages (EMA 8 & EMA 21): The 8 EMA has flattened and is trending close to the 21 EMA, signaling loss of momentum and indecision in the short term. A failure to reclaim the ₹1,30,750–₹1,31,000 region will likely keep the bias negative for the session.Gold prices have slipped below the mid-bollinger band, confirming a shift to mild bearishness. The lower Bollinger band near ₹1,29,200 could act as the next support if selling pressure intensifies.•⁠ ⁠Resistance Levels: ₹1,30,750 – ₹1,31,130 – ₹1,31,500•⁠ ⁠Support Levels: ₹1,29,800 – ₹1,29,300 – ₹1,29,000Repeated rejection near the upper pivots suggests a short-term top formation, strengthening the case for a downside move.The RSI is currently at 50.3, showing neutral momentum but with no signs of strength, implying limited upside potential and scope for corrective pressure.The MACD remains below the signal line, reflecting continued bearish sentiment. The histogram shows weak buying pressure, indicating that any bounce may remain short-lived.•⁠ ⁠Strategy: Sell on rise•⁠ ⁠Entry Zone: ₹1,30,400 – ₹1,30,450•⁠ ⁠Stop-Loss: ₹1,31,500•⁠ ⁠Targets: ₹1,29,300 and ₹1,29,000•⁠ ⁠Bias: Bearish below ₹1,30,750; sustained trade below ₹1,29,800 could accelerate downside momentum.Gold’s intraday structure remains weak with flattening EMAs, a neutral RSI, and a bearish MACD crossover. The repeated rejection near upper resistance reinforces a short-term bearish bias. Traders are advised to adopt a sell-on-rise strategy near ₹1,30,400, keeping a strict stop-loss at ₹1,31,500 and targeting ₹1,29,000. Sustained weakness below ₹1,29,800 could open further downside potential toward ₹1,28,800.","Gold prices are exhibiting weakness, says Jateen Trivedi, VP Research Analyst - Commodity and Currency, LKP Securities.

Russia Backs India’s Energy Needs As Putin Defies Trump And Promises Steady Fuel Supplies To Delhi

India’s Crude Oil Imports From Russia Set To Drop

India’s Russian Crude Imports Set To Fall In January

What’s next? Will India completely stop Russian crude imports?

Russia Quickly Became India’s Biggest Crude Supplier

Donald Trump’s sanctions on Russian crude majors may have the effect of India’s oil imports from Russia dropping to a four year low in January 2026. The Trump administration has been piling pressure on India to stop procuring crude oil from India. Of the 50% tariffs that the US has imposed on India, 25% are for its crude oil imports from Russia which the Trump government claims indirectly helps fund the war against Ukraine.While the 50% tariffs don’t seem to have impacted India’s imports of Russian crude, the sanctions on Rosneft and Lukoil announced in October have forced Indian refiners to look for alternative sources, though the option to purchase non-sanctioned Russian oil remains open.While the crude oil imports are set to drop, the important question is - for how long will this be the case? According to a Bloomberg report Russia is cranking up its own charm offensive, and alternative channels of procurement may emerge.Deliveries of Russian oil to India are projected to decrease to around 600,000 barrels per day next month, individuals involved in the transactions told Bloomberg. They may reach the lowest point since early 2022, when the Russia-Ukraine war began.Nevertheless, these oil import projections still remain higher than pre-conflict levels.In the past, India has benefitted substantially from global restrictions on Russian crude sales, emerging as the main purchaser of Russian seaborne crude amidst price reductions due to sanctions. Indian imports peaked at approximately 2.1 million barrels daily in June, making up about 45% of total crude imports.Refiners and traders suggest volumes could go up as non-sanctioned suppliers enter the market and new trading intermediaries emerge. Additionally, Russian President Vladimir Putin visited Delhi this week to discuss trade relations, offering assurances of ""uninterrupted shipments of fuel.""India's negotiations for a US trade agreement have progressed slowly, reducing the pressure to align with Washington's positions, the Bloomberg report said. US President Donald Trump recently indicated a potential reduction in punitive tariffs on India.Elisabeth Braw, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, told Bloomberg whilst US sanctions create obstacles, they cannot completely halt the trade. She noted that purchasing decisions are based on product suitability and pricing, rather than ideological alignment with Russia, and hence would likely continue.Restrictions on India's Russian oil imports have intensified since July, beginning with European Union sanctions on Nayara Energy Ltd., which has Rosneft backing. This marked the EU's first such measure. The Trump administration subsequently shifted from its previous acceptance of purchases under a Group of Seven price cap, openly criticising the trade and implementing a 50% tariff to enhance its exports and apply pressure on Putin.The implementation of the levy and subsequent sanctions on Rosneft and Lukoil have not completely halted oil flows, despite significantly impacting trade. Concerns about potential future disruptions led to increased November imports of 1.8 million barrels daily, as transactions were expedited.Also Read | Message for Trump? Putin says Russia ready to continue ‘uninterrupted shipments of fuel’ to India; pitches reliable supply of oil According to Sumit Ritolia, lead analyst for refining and modeling at Kpler, December volumes are expected to range between 1 to 1.2 million barrels per day, reflecting the surge in bookings by refiners prior to the sanctions' implementation.Although the government has not provided official directives regarding Russian crude, state refiners have adopted a cautious approach towards sanctions. Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals Ltd, and HPCL-Mittal Energy have stopped purchases entirely, whilst Indian Oil Corp and Bharat Petroleum Corp are accepting only restricted, non-sanctioned quantities, the report said.The extended timeline for Trump to finalise the agreement creates additional opportunities to evaluate the economic and political implications of reducing discounted oil purchases.""If the deal drags on, then more and more people will find ways or more pathways will be made to enable such non-sanctioned barrels to still be bought legitimately by the Indian purchasers,"" said June Goh, senior oil market analyst at Sparta Commodities.Indian refiners have shifted to costlier Middle Eastern crude oil varieties to compensate for Russian supplies. They've increased their US oil purchases, whilst checking sources in Guyana and Brazil to offset the shortfall. The sudden change led to higher shipping costs and vessel scarcity. Meanwhile, Russia faces financial pressure, with their crude selling at merely $40-$45 per barrel after discounts, industry sources report.A decline is expected in January, raising concerns about whether China, the other significant purchaser, can absorb the excess supply. Future trends will be influenced by various factors, including Trump's flexibility on tariffs, alongside the swift development of alternative arrangements as supply networks are restructured and price reductions become more substantial.Over the past few weeks, several new entities have emerged in port documentation as suppliers of Russian crude to Vadinar, including Eastimplex Stream FZE, Grewale Hub FZE and Tyndale Solutions FZE.""Indian refiners may also gradually find ways to shift towards non-sanctioned Russian entities, use of shadow carriers, adopt ship to ship transfers, etc in the future to balance geopolitical and economic considerations,"" analyst Bineet Banka at Nomura wrote in a note this week.The final amount will depend significantly on Reliance Industries, which until recently stood as the main purchaser of Russian crude exports. Whilst the company has stopped Russian oil purchases for its export-oriented facility and pledged to adhere to applicable sanctions, its existing agreement with Rosneft could potentially contribute up to 350,000 barrels daily in January.As Sumit Ritolia points out, “While India’s oil imports from Russia are likely to decrease, the decline is most likely to be temporary, allowing the supply chain to reorganise itself. Unless more expansive secondary sanctions are introduced, India will continue to buy from a non-sanctioned supplier of Russian oil. The reasons are multiple: the geopolitical and economic dimensions are both essential. Political leaders will not want to be seen as bending down to US sanctions. At the same time, Russian barrels remain highly cost-competitive, and workarounds to maintain flows are likely to emerge. In particular, buyers may increasingly pivot to non-sanctioned Russian entities and opaque trading channels.”","Deliveries of Russian oil to India are projected to decrease to around 600,000 barrels per day next month. They may reach the lowest point since early 2022, when the Russia-Ukraine war began.

Indian Railways deploys special trains

10 key directives issued by the Centre



The government directed that IndiGo must complete all pending passenger refunds for cancelled or disrupted flights by 8pm on Sunday, December 7. Airlines, including IndiGo, have also been instructed not to levy any rescheduling fees for passengers affected by cancellations or major delays. IndiGo must ensure that all baggage separated from passengers during cancellation or delays is traced and delivered to the passenger’s residential or chosen address within the next 48 hours. Airlines have been told to maintain clear communication with passengers regarding tracking and delivery timelines, and to provide compensation where required under existing passenger rights regulations. ` To stop surge pricing during the nationwide crisis, the government has imposed fare caps across affected routes. These must be followed strictly. The airfare caps will remain in place until operations return to normal. Any violations will attract regulatory action. The DGCA's Flight Duty Time Limitations (FDTL) norms have been placed in abeyance to help airlines deploy more cockpit crew without compromising safety. The ministry of civil aviation expects schedules to begin normalising within 24 hours and fully stabilising within the next three days. The ministry said that if a flight is cancelled, airlines must issue full refunds automatically, no passenger requests required. Airlines must offer hotel accommodation, refreshments and essential services for passengers stranded due to long delays. Special support, including lounge access, faster processing and dedicated help, must be provided to vulnerable travellers. To ensure real-time monitoring, the government has opened a 24×7 control room (011-24610843, 011-24693963, 096503-91859) to coordinate swift action.

Industry bodies welcome government action



FDTL norms at the root of the crisis

NEW DELHI: IndiGo ’s nationwide operational crisis entered its fifth day on Satuday, with the airline cancelling over 800 flights, even as the government tightened oversight, imposed fare caps, ordered immediate refunds and warned of regulatory action for any non-compliance.While the disruptions continued to affect thousands of passengers across the country, the airline, in a statement, said that it had restored more than 95% of its network connectivity and was gradually stabilizing operations.Meanwhile, DGCA has issued a show-cause notice to IndiGo CEO Pieter Elbers over the mass flight disruptions that have stranded thousands of passengers since December 2.In its latest statement, IndiGo said it deliberately scaled down operations to reboot rosters and systems and was seeing early signs of recovery.“With regards to destinations, over 95% of network connectivity has already been re-established as we are able to operate to 135 out of the existing 138 destinations in operations,” an IndiGo spokesperson in a statement said.In its statement, the airlines added that it expected to operate over 1,500 flights by the end of Sunday.The carrier said that the teams were focused on stabilizing schedules, reducing delays and supporting customers.It added that the refund issues were being handled on a priority basis.The airline thanked government agencies, airport partners, staff and customers for their support and patience and apologized again for the disruption.In another press statement, the airline said that it is working to bring its operations back on track across the network. It added that teams are focused on stabilising schedules, reducing delays and supporting passengers. The number of cancellations has dropped below 850 flights and is expected to decrease further in the coming days.According to the show-cause notice issued, DGCA has sought a response within 24 hours, asking why enforcement action should not be taken against him for alleged operational lapses that led to widespread cancellations and delays.As per the notice, IndiGo’s disruptions were primarily caused by the airline’s failure to make “adequate arrangements” to handle revised roster rules under the new FDTL (flight duty time limitations) scheme. The regulator said this reflected “significant lapses in planning, oversight and resource management” and amounted to prima facie non-compliance with Aircraft Rules and Civil Aviation Requirements.After cancelling over 1,000 flights on Friday, IndiGo grounded more than 800 flights on Saturday. The airline’s on-time performance at six major metro airports plunged to 3.7% on Friday, according to civil aviation ministry data, highlighting the scale of operational breakdown.IndiGo, which normally operates over 2,200 flights per day, was forced to sharply cut services as crew shortages and scheduling issues persisted under the new regulatory framework.In response to mounting passenger distress, the civil aviation ministry directed IndiGo to complete all refunds for cancelled and disrupted flights by 8 pm on Sunday. Airlines were also instructed not to levy any rescheduling charges for passengers affected by cancellations or long delays.The ministry further ordered the airline to trace and deliver all baggage separated from travellers within the next 48 hours and to maintain constant communication with passengers on delivery timelines.IndiGo has also been directed to operate dedicated passenger support and refund facilitation cells to proactively reach out to impacted travellers. The ministry said the automatic refund system must remain active until operations fully stabilize.The government warned that regulatory action would be initiated for any violation of these directions. A 24×7 control room has also been activated to monitor the situation and coordinate rapid responses.To curb steep fare surges triggered by seat shortages, the government imposed temporary fare caps across all domestic routes:These caps exclude User Development Fee, Passenger Service Fee and applicable taxes and are not applicable to Business Class or UDAN flights.The ministry said the caps would remain in force until the situation stabilises and directed airlines to avoid any unusual upward fare revisions on affected routes. It also clarified that the caps would apply across all ticketing platforms, including airline websites and online travel agents.The intervention followed reports of extreme fare spikes, with fares for some routes shooting up to as high as Rs 90,000, triggering widespread outrage.In response to rising passenger demand following widespread flight cancellations, Indian Railways has begun operating special train services across multiple zones.A total of 89 special trains, covering over 100 trips, have been scheduled over the next three days to ensure smooth travel and maintain connectivity during the winter seasonThe Central government ordered IndiGo to clear all pending passenger refunds without delay. The ministry of civil aviation said the intervention was essential to safeguard passengers grappling with uncertainty, soaring ticket prices and prolonged delays.Tourism and travel industry bodies backed the move. Indian Association of Tour Operators President Ravi Gosain said unpredictable fare spikes damage consumer confidence and disrupt tour planning.FAITH board member Anil Kalsi said the fare cap was essential to protect passenger rights and called for a permanent policy mechanism to prevent such shocks in the future.The current crisis was triggered by the implementation of the revised Flight Duty Time Limitation (FDTL) norms, which mandated longer weekly rest periods, extended night hours and fewer permitted night landings. These changes required airlines to deploy significantly more crew.IndiGo had opposed the norms when they were first notified in January 2024, arguing that airlines needed more time to build adequate crew strength. Other domestic carriers, including Air India, had also expressed initial reservations.To help restore services, the DGCA provided temporary relief to IndiGo by rolling back the night-duty definition to 12 am–5 am from 12 am–6 am and allowing pilots more night landings, among other relaxations.The move is intended to enable a faster deployment of cockpit crew and speed up recovery. The Airlines’ Pilots Association (ALPA) India, however, has strongly objected to what it called “selective and unsafe” relief, warning that any dilution of fatigue-mitigation standards could endanger safety and contravene court directions.","Government orders refunds, baggage return and passenger support.

How To Track IndiGo Refund Status ?

Airfares capped

IndiGo flight cancellations latest news: IndiGo has said that it expects to operate more than 1500 flights by day's end on Saturday, having restored over 95% of network connectivity by serving 135 out of 138 operational destinations. IndiGo typically operates 2300 flights daily. IndiGo has said that its personnel are working to normalise operations, minimise flight delays and assist passengers during this challenging period.IndiGo operated merely 700 flights on Friday, indicating 1,600 flight cancellations. IndiGo's CEO Pieter Elbers acknowledged the extensive cancellations, confirming ""over 1,000 flights"" were cancelled on Friday.The airline recorded the largest number of flight cancellations by an Indian carrier in the nation's aviation history. Additionally, IndiGo's on-time-performance plummeted to 3.7 per cent on Friday due to operational disruptions caused by the implementation of new pilot duty and rest period regulations, according to the Civil Aviation Ministry website.Starting November 1, the second phase of these regulations redefined night hours from 12am-6am, altered from the previous 12am-5am, and reduced permitted night landings from six to two.These changes affect all domestic airlines in India.The Gurugram-based carrier IndiGo, partly owned by Rahul Bhatia, has obtained temporary relief from DGCA, allowing them to revert to the previous night duty definition of 12am to 5am and permitting pilots to perform six night landings.“Addressing the recent disruptions in our network, we had cancelled a significant number of flights and operated little above 700 flights yesterday connecting 113 destinations. The main objective was to reboot the network, systems, and rosters so that we could start afresh today with a higher number of flights, improved stability, and there are some early signs of improvement.

As many as 87% of IndiGo passengers surveyed want the airline’s service deficiencies to be examined under the Class Action provisions of the Consumer Protection Act (CP Act), 2019, following widespread flight cancellations and delays, according to a survey cited by PTI.The survey, conducted by LocalCircles, comes in the wake of IndiGo cancelling hundreds of flights over the last four days, leaving thousands of passengers stranded across airports and triggering sharp criticism over handling of refunds, compensation and customer support, PTI reported.The Class Action provision under the CP Act allows a group of consumers with a common grievance to collectively seek legal remedy against a company for issues such as deficiency of service, mismanagement or unfair practices.Beyond cancellations and delays, many passengers raised concerns over refund integrity, including deductions and delays, failed “zero-cancellation” or insurance assurances, itinerary changes without consent and the lack of adequate support or compensation when connections were missed, as per the survey findings.The survey posed the question: “Should the Central Consumer Protection Authority (CCPA) take up service deficiency of IndiGo under Class Action provision of the Consumer Protection Act 2019?” Out of 32,547 respondents, 87% said “yes, absolutely”, 3% said it was not required, while 10% gave no clear response, PTI said.“To sum up, 87% of airline passengers surveyed want CCPA to take up service deficiency of IndiGo under Class Action provision of the Consumer Protection Act 2019,” the statement said.LocalCircles also noted complaints from passengers who either accepted cancellations or cancelled bookings themselves, claiming that refunds credited were significantly lower than fares paid, despite assurances of “100% refunds”.The survey received responses from more than 30,000 consumers across 303 districts in India, the statement added.","87% of IndiGo passengers surveyed want the airline’s service deficiencies to be examined under the Class Action provisions of the Consumer Protection Act, 2019.

"Clean energy surge: India adds record 31.25 GW non-fossil capacity this year, says Pralhad Joshi",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/clean-energy-surge-india-adds-record-31-25-gw-non-fossil-capacity-this-year-says-pralhad-joshi/articleshow/125806971.cms,"India has recorded its highest-ever annual addition of clean energy capacity, with 31.25 GW of non-fossil power added in the current financial year so far, Union minister for new and renewable energy Pralhad Joshi said on Friday, highlighting the country’s accelerating energy transition. Of the total addition, solar capacity alone accounted for 24.28 GW, underscoring the central role of solar power in India’s renewable push.Speaking at the Global Energy Leaders’ Summit 2025 in Puri, Odisha, Joshi said India has emerged as a key driver of the global surge in renewable energy, noting that while it took the world nearly 70 years to reach 1 terawatt (TW) of renewable capacity by 2022, the second TW was added in just two years, by 2024, ANI reported. He said India’s contribution has been significant, with the country adding 46 GW of solar capacity between 2022 and 2024 to become the world’s third-largest contributor to global solar installations. The minister’s remarks were reported by ANI.Joshi said India’s solar capacity has expanded from just 2.8 GW a decade ago to around 130 GW now, a growth of more than 4,500 per cent over the last 11 years. He noted that while India holds the world’s fifth-largest coal reserves and remains the second-largest coal consumer, it is increasingly balancing fossil fuels with renewable energy as the transition gathers pace, making clean energy strategically critical amid evolving global trade and industrial competitiveness pressures.Announcing new clean energy initiatives for Odisha, the minister said the Centre has approved a consumer-owned Utility-Led Aggregation (ULA) model under the PM Surya Ghar scheme to install 1.5 lakh rooftop solar systems of 1 kW each in the State. The programme is expected to benefit nearly 7–8 lakh people, particularly from economically weaker households. He added that Odisha already has over 3.1 GW of installed renewable capacity, with clean energy accounting for more than 34% of the State’s total installed power capacity.Under the PM Surya Ghar Yojana, around 1.6 lakh households in Odisha have applied for rooftop solar installations, with over 23,000 installations completed so far. More than 19,200 families have received subsidies exceeding Rs 147 crore directly into their bank accounts, Joshi said. He attributed India’s renewable energy expansion to an enabling ecosystem created through policy reforms, ease of doing business, investor confidence, demand-driven schemes and strong Centre–State cooperation, expressing confidence that Odisha would play a leading role in the next phase of green growth.","Of the total addition, solar capacity alone accounted for 24.28 GW, underscoring the central role of solar power in India’s renewable push.

We are poised to become world leaders. We are in a position where we can show the world that power is a tradable commodity and we can be global leaders in this,” Srivastava said.The conference brought together solution providers and power distribution companies with the aim of enabling collaboration and innovation.Shashank Mishra, Joint Secretary in the Ministry of Power, said the initiative was designed to create a common platform for developing new solutions.“Today we are bringing together solution providers and distribution companies on a single platform where they can interact and develop new solutions and ideas. We are also presenting several innovative concepts in the form of solutions, and the best among them will be awarded by the Minister of Power,” Mishra told ANI.He added that the government expects the initiative to be “a transformative” step for the sector.Highlighting ongoing reforms, Srivastava said the Ministry of Power has been driving changes under the Revamped Distribution Sector Scheme (RDSS), with smart metering forming a core pillar of the programme. He stressed that the benefits of smart meters can be fully realised only with the use of advanced analytics.“To understand the advantages of smart metering, it is essential to leverage the power of artificial intelligence and machine learning,” he said, adding that such tools can aid anti-theft measures, load forecasting and system rationalisation.According to Srivastava, the conference seeks to demonstrate how AI- and machine learning-based tools can improve consumer services, assist electricity regulators and help discoms function more efficiently.India’s energy sector has strengthened significantly in recent years, balancing rising demand with sustainability goals. Citing International Energy Agency projections, speakers noted that emerging and developing economies will account for about 85 per cent of the growth in global electricity demand over the next three years, with India playing a central role.As of June 2025, India’s total installed power capacity stood at 476 GW, while power shortages have declined sharply from 4.2 per cent in 2013-14 to 0.1 per cent in 2024-25, according to official data.",India’s data centre and artificial intelligence ecosystem could position the country as a global leader in power trade.

The latest commitment compares with €165 billion earmarked for 2025–2029 and €180 billion for 2024–2028, with 2024 marking the peak year for spending.Since that peak, the group — which houses brands such as Porsche and Audi — has been squeezed by higher costs and weaker margins, hit by US tariffs on imported vehicles and intensifying competition in China. The strain has been felt most acutely at Porsche, which derives nearly half of its sales from the US and China combined.Porsche recently unveiled a significant rollback of its electric vehicle strategy as profits came under pressure. Speaking to Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung, Blume said the focus of the latest investment plan was firmly “on Germany and Europe,” particularly in products, technology and infrastructure.Blume added that discussions on an extended savings programme at Porsche are expected to continue into 2026. He also said he does not expect Porsche to grow in China, though localising production across the wider Volkswagen group remains an option. A China-specific Porsche model could make sense at some point, he said.On Audi, Blume noted that any decision on building a manufacturing plant in the United States would depend on whether Washington offers substantial financial support.Blume, who will step down as Porsche CEO in January to concentrate fully on running Volkswagen Group, said his recent contract extension as Volkswagen chief executive until 2030 signalled continued backing from the Porsche and Piëch families as well as the German state of Lower Saxony, the company’s largest shareholders.“But it is true, of course, that shareholders have suffered losses since Porsche went public three years ago.

The Commerce Department said on Friday that prices rose 0.3% in September from August, matching the previous month’s increase, in a report delayed five weeks by the government shutdown.Core prices — excluding food and energy — rose 0.2%, also the same as August. On an annual basis, overall prices increased 2.8%, slightly above 2.7% in August, while core inflation eased marginally to 2.8% from 2.9%, According to AP report.Economists said the data point to muted core inflation and bolster the case for a rate cut, even though headline inflation remains above the Fed’s 2% target. They noted that President Donald Trump’s tariffs continue to put upward pressure on prices, though Fed officials argue that slow hiring, modest economic growth and subdued wage gains are likely to cool inflation in coming months.Omair Sharif, chief economist at Inflation Insights, said Friday’s report would likely reassure policymakers that core inflation remains contained.But he flagged one area of concern: a measure of services inflation that remains stubbornly high.“It hasn’t really shown any sign of slowing down,” Sharif said. “That has to be concerning for them.”The Fed faces a difficult policy choice next week. Under typical conditions, it would keep rates elevated to curb inflation. But with hiring weakening and unemployment slowly rising, it hopes that cutting rates will spur borrowing and support the economy.Consumer spending, meanwhile, rose 0.3% in September, down from 0.5% in August, signalling softer household demand.

"Trust fund babies – but there's a twist! What are ‘Trump Accounts’? Here's how to claim your $1,000",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/trust-fund-babies-but-theres-a-twist-what-are-trump-accounts-heres-how-to-claim-your-1000/articleshow/125778800.cms,"So, what exactly is the Trump Account?



Who qualifies for the $1,000?



They must be US citizens and have a Social Security number. The programme is limited only to the babies born during Trump administration, i.e., born between January 1, 2025 and December 31, 2028. A parent can open the account regardless of their own immigration status.

Nothing for older children?



Enrolling for Trump Accounts



Why supporters say the programme matters



Concerns from critics



The journey into adulthood has looked different for everyone, depending on the family they are born into. In affluent homes, young people often leave with a trust fund to soften the landing, while for the less privileged, turning 18 can mean stepping into financial responsibility almost overnight. This, however, might change with the less famous provision of US President Donald Trump's tax legislation, which aims to give $1,000 to every new born.Say hello to the Trump Account that promises to help narrow that divide by ensuring every child enters adulthood with something to build on.Inside this provision, every newborn gets $1,000, provided their parents open an investment account under the new programme. The bill, which became law earlier this year, allows private firms to invest the funds in the stock market, and the child gains access only when they turn 18. Parents of older children can also participate by opening an account, although those children won’t receive the $1,000 incentive.However, a significant boost arrived earlier this week when philanthropists Michael and Susan Dell pledged funding that will allow some children aged 10 and below to receive $250 if their parents open an account.The Dell donation applies to children living in ZIP codes where the median family income is $150,000 or less, and who would not otherwise qualify for the Treasury-funded $1,000.A Trump Account functions as a long-term savings vehicle tied directly to the stock market. Money is held until the child turns 18 and can only be used for specific milestones, including paying for higher education, starting a business or making a down payment on a house.When an account is created for an eligible newborn, the US Treasury contributes $1,000. Private banks and brokerages manage the investments, and the rules require that funds be placed in US equity index funds with annual fees capped at 0.10%.Parents may also add up to the funds, contributing up to $2,500 per year in pretax income, much like a retirement account. Employers, friends, relatives, local governments and charitable groups can also contribute. There is a $5,000 yearly contribution cap, not considering government and charitable donations.The $1,000 seed deposit is available to babies who tick all these boxes:Though children born before 2025 will not receive the $1,000 Treasury incentive, an account can still be opened for any child younger than 18.These accounts allow up to $2,500 per year in pretax contributions from parents. Some may also qualify for the Dells’ $250 donation if they are aged 10 or under and live in eligible ZIP codes.While contributions cannot be made until July 2026, families can begin the enrolment process by submitting Form 4547 to the Internal Revenue Service.Parents who sign up early will receive instructions in May to complete the setup process. The White House says an online portal for account registration will go live in July.Another thing to keep in mind is that the money cannot be used before the child turns 18 except in exceptional cases, and withdrawals will be taxed, meaning the programme is not designed to assist with immediate household needs.Those backing the idea argue that the initiative expands access to stock market investing and offers even children born into poverty the opportunity to gain from long-term financial growth. They say that providing every newborn with $1,000 could counter the rising appeal of socialism by giving more Americans a direct path to wealth creation. The US Securities and Exchange Commission reports that 58% of American households owned stocks or bonds in 2022, but the richest 1% held almost half of the total value.Before Trump Accounts, there were ""baby bonds,"" introduced by states like California, Connecticut and the district of Columbia, that targeted children raised in poverty, foster care or those who lost a parent to COVID-19. Several other states, including Maryland, are weighing similar schemes.However, unlike Trump Accounts, those state-led programmes exclude wealthier children and are funded and managed by governments instead of private investment firms.Opponents argue that the programme offers no support to children during their early years, the stage when families are most financially vulnerable. They also note that the accounts do not compensate for cuts made elsewhere. The Trump administration and congressional Republicans reduced funding for programmes including Medicaid and food assistance in the same tax bill that introduced the accounts.They further warned that the policy could deepen economic inequality. Families capable of making the maximum yearly pretax contribution will see the greatest financial gains, whereas those unable to save will benefit the least. Using a projected annual return of 7%, the $1,000 Treasury contribution would grow to roughly $3,570 by the time a child reaches 18.","The Trump Account is a provision of US President Donald Trump's tax legislation. Every newborn born between January 1, 2025 and December 31, 2028 gets $1,000, provided their parents open an investment account. Private firms can invest the funds in the stock market, and the child gains access only when they turn 18.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125787990,imgsize-115258,width-400,resizemode-4/this-is-an-ai-generated-image-used-only-for-representative-purpose.jpg"

Netflix was born out of the resentments of the video cassette age. Anyone who lived through the 1990s remembers the ritual: rushing to the local rental store on a Friday evening, discovering the last VHS copy was already gone and then returning the tape late on Monday morning, only to be punished with a fee that cost more than the film. Netflix emerged as a small Californian rebellion against this experience. Instead of fluorescent aisles and impatient clerks, it offered DVDs in red envelopes mailed directly to your home. Instead of rewinding tapes, you simply logged into a website and waited for the postman to arrive. It was a simple idea designed for people who wanted to escape the tyranny of Blockbuster.Two and a half decades later, that humble mail-order start-up is preparing to buy the studio that helped build modern Hollywood itself. Netflix’s planned acquisition of Warner Bros – the century-old home of Casablanca, Harry Potter, DC superheroes, The Lord of the Rings (via New Line), HBO and control of classics like The Wizard of Oz – for an enterprise value of roughly 82.7 billion dollars marks a transformative moment in entertainment history. For the first time, a company that began its life shipping DVDs is about to take ownership of a film and television library that has shaped global culture for a hundred years.This is not just a corporate transaction. It is the moment streaming becomes the centre of the entertainment universe.Netflix’s early success came from identifying a simple human truth: people hated late fees. The company replaced penalties with subscriptions and replaced return dates with unlimited rentals. But the real leap arrived in 2007, when Netflix began streaming films directly over the internet. At the time, internet video was grainy, unreliable and better suited for cat clips than cinema. Yet Netflix bet that broadband infrastructure would catch up.That bet proved correct. Streaming transformed Netflix from a quirky DVD service into the largest entertainment platform on the planet. The company expanded around the world, built an unmatched recommendation system and eventually began producing its own shows. House of Cards and Orange Is the New New Black showed that Netflix could make premium television. Stranger Things, Money Heist, Squid Game and Bridgerton made it a cultural force.Yet Netflix still faced one structural weakness. It had hits, but it did not have heritage. Unlike Disney or Warner Bros, it did not own a deep catalogue of films and shows that could be reimagined for generations, sold across formats or spun into franchises. Its library was powerful but relatively young. For a subscription business, long-lasting intellectual property becomes the anchor that holds audiences in place.If Netflix represents the story of technological disruption, Warner Bros represents the foundation of Hollywood itself. Founded in 1923, the studio introduced sound to cinema with The Jazz Singer. It gave the world Casablanca, defined the golden age of musicals with titles it now controls such as The Wizard of Oz, shaped modern rebellion with Rebel Without a Cause, reinvented horror with The Exorcist and expanded the boundaries of action cinema with The Matrix. Its New Line division shepherded The Lord of the Rings trilogy to global acclaim.Its television arm is equally influential. HBO transformed scripted entertainment by proving that cinematic storytelling could thrive on the small screen. The Sopranos, The Wire, Game of Thrones and Succession reshaped what television could be. Meanwhile, Warner’s mainstream sitcoms – Friends, The Big Bang Theory, ER and dozens more – became the comfort food of global syndication.But Warner Bros also endured repeated mergers, debt burdens and strategic upheavals. As cable television declined, the economics that once funded HBO came under strain. HBO Max, though expanding into new regions and still growing, lagged Netflix in global scale. The company found itself navigating the impossible balance between legacy networks, theatrical releases and streaming ambitions.This is the legacy Netflix is buying.But Netflix’s expansion is not being greeted with universal enthusiasm. A group of prominent filmmakers has already sent an anonymous letter to members of the US Congress warning that the acquisition could “hold a noose around the theatrical marketplace,” arguing that a Netflix-controlled Warner Bros would have the power to shrink theatrical release windows and destabilise the ecosystem that sustains thousands of industry jobs. Their note, referenced in the Variety report, describes fears that Netflix’s dominance as both a buyer and distributor could give it unprecedented leverage over exhibition chains, post-theatrical licensing and the financial health of feature filmmaking itself. The appeal urges lawmakers to subject the deal to the highest level of antitrust scrutiny, framing the merger not merely as a business story but a cultural and institutional inflection point for Hollywood.The financials make clear how monumental this transaction is. Netflix will acquire the Warner Bros studio, HBO, HBO Max and the entire film and television catalogue for an enterprise value of roughly 82.7 billion dollars and equity value of around 72 billion dollars. Shareholders will receive a mix of cash and Netflix stock valued at about 27.75 dollars per share. Netflix expects annual cost savings of two to three billion dollars by year three and forecasts that the deal will increase earnings per share by year two.Before the acquisition closes, Warner Bros Discovery will spin off its linear networks – CNN, Discovery, TLC and various factual and lifestyle channels – into a separate company. Netflix is purchasing the creative and streaming heart of the Warner empire, not the legacy cable infrastructure.This deal rivals Disney’s acquisition of 21st Century Fox in scale and easily surpasses most modern entertainment mergers. Yet the dynamic is entirely different: a digital-born platform is absorbing a traditional studio, not the other way around.The acquisition solves three long-standing problems for Netflix in one move.The first is the library gap. By acquiring Warner’s vault, Netflix finally gains a catalogue with true generational weight. DC superheroes, Harry Potter, Game of Thrones, The Matrix, Looney Tunes, HBO’s golden-age dramas and thousands of films and TV episodes become permanent Netflix assets. These are not simply shows and movies; they are narrative worlds that can be extended, rebooted and monetised for decades.The second change is theatrical power. Warner Bros owns soundstages, production facilities and distribution relationships that span the globe. Netflix’s relationship with cinemas has always been experimental and occasionally uneasy. By inheriting Warner’s infrastructure and release commitments, Netflix gains the credibility and machinery of a long-standing theatrical studio. It no longer needs to choose between being a streaming platform or a film studio. It becomes both.The third transformation concerns control. Netflix no longer depends on external studios for high-value franchises. It controls windows, renewals, merchandising and long-term franchise strategy. It can blend its vast viewer data with Warner’s storytelling and production expertise to decide which universes to expand and how to release them.In effect, Netflix stops being primarily a distributor and becomes a full-spectrum entertainment conglomerate.For years, Disney has been the only company with true franchise supremacy. Marvel, Star Wars, Pixar and Disney Animation feed into a global ecosystem of films, streaming, merchandise, parks and cruises. It has been the only studio able to dominate theatre schedules and streaming algorithms simultaneously.Netflix acquiring Warner Bros challenges that supremacy for the first time in a meaningful way. Disney and Netflix will now sit on comparable piles of narrative universes. Where Disney has Marvel, Netflix will have DC. Where Disney has Star Wars, Netflix will hold the worlds of Game of Thrones and Harry Potter. Where Disney has a robust theatrical pipeline, Netflix will now have one too.Disney remains a powerhouse, but it now competes with an entity that has both greater digital reach and an equally recognisable roster of franchises. Its task becomes maintaining cultural momentum in an environment where Netflix’s catalogue will suddenly look far deeper and far more emotionally familiar to audiences across the world.For smaller studios, the landscape becomes far more challenging. Paramount, which had aggressively pursued Warner as a way to bulk up, now finds itself exposed. Its franchises – Mission: Impossible, Top Gun, Star Trek, Nickelodeon – are valuable but not enough to compete with the consolidated libraries of Netflix–Warner or Disney. A merger or sale appears increasingly likely simply to remain viable.NBCUniversal’s Peacock also misses the chance to absorb HBO content. Sony, lacking a major streaming platform of its own, must choose whether to remain a licensing powerhouse or seek deeper alliances. In an environment dominated by scale, mid-sized players face enormous pressure either to specialise or to consolidate.From an analytical standpoint, the streaming landscape is now evolving into a three-pole system: Netflix–Warner, Disney and Amazon–MGM. Other services may continue to exist, but most will orbit these core ecosystems rather than challenge them directly.For a decade, streaming was framed as the insurgent force attacking Hollywood’s old order. Netflix was the outsider; studios were the establishment. Cable bundles, release windows and theatrical exclusivity were the system Netflix sought to disrupt.This deal erases that divide completely. When the world’s largest streaming service acquires a studio that defined Hollywood’s golden age, the categories collapse. Streaming is no longer the challenger; streaming becomes the industry’s organising principle. Theatrical releases become one element of a multi-platform strategy anchored in global subscriptions and long-term intellectual property.Hollywood’s centre shifts from geography to architecture: whoever controls the universes – and the pipeline that delivers them – controls the culture.For audiences, the benefits will appear slowly but unmistakably. More iconic films and series will live under a single subscription. HBO’s prestige slate, Warner’s classics, DC’s superheroes, Harry Potter, Game of Thrones and Netflix originals will eventually coexist on one platform. Convenience will increase, even as questions about pricing and competition intensify.For creators, the merger brings both opportunity and uncertainty. Netflix–Warner will become the world’s most powerful buyer of scripted content, capable of financing ambitious projects at scale. Yet consolidation also means fewer independent bidders for talent and a need to reconcile HBO’s creator-driven culture with Netflix’s data-driven commissioning.And for Hollywood, this is a turning point. A company built to eliminate late fees will now own the archives that define a century of storytelling. Technological disruption has merged with cinematic legacy, and the result is an entertainment ecosystem unlike anything the industry has seen.Netflix was once the outsider. With this acquisition, it becomes the custodian of one of the most important film and television libraries ever assembled. The future of entertainment will no longer be determined by who makes the most compelling story, but by who controls the universes that audiences return to year after year.Netflix wanted to escape the tyranny of the video store. It now finds itself in charge of Hollywood’s memory – and its future.","Netflix's planned acquisition of Warner Bros marks a transformative moment in entertainment history.

The streaming giant is now in exclusive negotiations to purchase Warner Bros Discovery’s film and television studios, as well as its streaming businesses, after putting forward an offer priced at $28 per share, according to a source with direct knowledge of the discussions.Warner Bros Discovery, the owner of HBO, has spent months weighing strategic options. A second round of bids arrived this week following initial proposals from Netflix, Paramount Skydance and Comcast. Reuters previously reported that Netflix submitted a mostly cash offer and ultimately surfaced as the frontrunner.At $28 per share, Netflix’s bid exceeds Warner Bros Discovery’s closing price of $24.54 on Thursday, and also tops a nearly $24 proposal made by Paramount that covered the company’s entire portfolio, including its cable channels such as CNN, TNT and TBS.The move marks another bold shift in Netflix’s strategy as it pushes beyond its core subscription business to tap additional revenue sources. Securing Warner Bros, home to franchises including Harry Potter, Game of Thrones and DC Comics, would place Netflix in control of some of the world’s most valuable entertainment properties and move it towards becoming a vertically integrated powerhouse that produces, distributes and monetises major IP on its own platforms.The company has also been extending its reach into gaming, live content and consumer experiences.Bloomberg News reported that Netflix is willing to pay a breakup fee of $5 billion if regulators block the transaction, and that the two companies could unveil a formal agreement within days, according Reuters.The possibility of the takeover has triggered industry pushback. Variety reported that a consortium of prominent film figures has called on the US Congress to intervene should Netflix’s attempt succeed, warning of a “looming economic and institutional crisis” across Hollywood.Meanwhile, CNBC said on Thursday that Paramount has accused Warner Bros of conducting a sale process that unfairly benefits Netflix over other bidders. The network cited a letter sent by the newly merged media company.""We strongly urge you to empower such a special committee comprised of directors with no potential appearance of bias or beholdenness to others whose interests may differ from those of the stockholders,"" Paramount's legal team wrote in the letter, cited by Reuters.The latest bidding follows a failed attempt earlier this year: in October, Warner Bros declined an estimated $60 billion takeover offer from Paramount for the entire business before launching a more structured sales process for its assets.","Netflix is in exclusive negotiations to purchase Warner Bros Discovery's film and television studios, as well as its streaming businesses.

Vetting and screening of non-citizens will be increased: USCIS

The Trump administration has once again introduced new changes, making its immigration policy more restrictive.On Thursday, US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) updated its Policy Manual to sharply limit the length of Employment Authorization Documents (EADs) for several categories of immigrants, including refugees, asylum seekers, and applicants awaiting adjustment of status.Under the new policy, the maximum duration for initial and renewal work permits will drop from five years to 18 months for refugees, people granted asylum, those with withholding of removal, and applicants with pending cases for asylum, adjustment of status or other humanitarian relief, as per press release.The change applies to employment authorization applications filed or pending on or after December 5, 2025.USCIS said the shift is intended to increase the frequency of vetting and screening for noncitizens seeking authorization to work in the United States as part of a broader immigration enforcement push.“Reducing the maximum validity period for employment authorization will ensure that those seeking to work in the United States do not threaten public safety or promote harmful anti-American ideologies,"" Director Joseph Edlow said.He also pointed out the recent attack on National Guard and said that such incidents made vetting necessary so that the government can stop ""aliens.""After the attack on National Guard service members in our nation’s capital by an alien who was admitted into this country by the previous administration, it’s even more clear that USCIS must conduct frequent vetting of aliens,"" Edlow added.Separately, recent requirements in the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” signed into law July 4, 2025, will cap work authorization at one year — or the end of an individual’s parole or Temporary Protected Status (TPS) period, whichever is shorter — for immigrants paroled as refugees, those granted or applying for TPS, other parolees, and spouses of entrepreneur parole recipients. Those limits apply to any work permit applications filed or pending on or after July 22, 2025, when USCIS published a notice in the Federal Register outlining implementation.","US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) updated its Policy Manual to sharply limit the length of Employment Authorization Documents (EADs) for several categories of immigrants.

'Do Not UNDERESTIMATE Russia': Jeffrey Sachs Big Message To 'DELUSIONAL' U.S. & Trump

The United States has temporarily lifted some restrictions on Lukoil-branded fuel stations operating outside Russia, allowing them to continue running despite sanctions placed on the parent company.The treasury department confirmed on Thursday that these stations — including those in the US — can keep serving customers without enabling revenue to move back to Russia, which remains under extensive American and European sanctions over its actions in Ukraine.The exemption will stay in force until 29 April 2026, reported Reuters.The relaxation marks a partial suspension of measures introduced by US President Donald Trump in October.The announcement comes in the same week US officials met Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow as part of efforts to advance a Washington-backed plan to end the conflict.Lukoil’s footprint outside Russia is substantial. The company operates around 200 stations across New Jersey, Pennsylvania and New York.Its Finnish subsidiary Teboil, which runs roughly 430 fuel stations, has already begun winding down operations as supplies diminish, with expectations that Lukoil will eventually sell the chain.Beyond this, the firm remains a dominant retail player in Moldova and Bulgaria and manages about 600 outlets in Turkey and over 300 in Romania.The decision to soften restrictions comes against the backdrop of wider sanctions imposed by Washington.The US placed its first major penalties on Lukoil and Rosneft, freezing all American-based assets and banning US firms from engaging with them.The companies, which together contribute around 55% of Russia’s petroleum output, were added to the Specially Designated Nationals (SDN) list.Businesses were given until 21 November to cut ties or risk secondary sanctions that could limit access to US banking, shipping and insurance services.India’s energy sector is also feeling the impact. New US sanctions on Rosneft and Lukoil have turned their crude into a “sanctioned molecule,” analysts said, as per PTI.Although India imported an average of 1.7 million barrels per day of Russian crude this year — with November expected to touch 1.8–1.9 million bpd — inflows are forecast to drop sharply to about 4,00,000 bpd in December and January.Several refiners, including Reliance Industries and HPCL-Mittal Energy, have paused purchases, with only Rosneft-backed Nayara Energy continuing supplies due to its dependence on Russian barrels.Experts say the restrictions apply specifically to designated companies, not to all Russian crude.This allows Indian buyers to legally source barrels from non-sanctioned producers such as Gazprom Neft or Surgutneftegaz, provided no blacklisted entity is involved in shipping, banking or trading.Reliance, which operates one of the world’s largest refining complexes, has already stopped using Russian crude in its export-oriented SEZ refinery to comply with upcoming EU rules.","The exemption will stay in force until 29 April 2026.

CNN reported that the acquisition follows an agreement reached in April, under which Prada committed to purchasing Versace for about $1.51 billion, a deal that materialised after Capri Holdings’ planned sale to Tapestry fell apart because of an antitrust challenge.Lorenzo Bertelli, the son of Prada founders Miuccia Prada and Patrizio Bertelli, is set to assume the role of executive chairman at Versace. Speaking about the extended discussions that paved the way for the deal, he said, ""There had already been contacts during the Covid period, and there were talks even before Capri's sale to Tapestry. When that deal fell through over antitrust issues, we came back and tried to speed things up. It was something that had been in the works for a long time.”With the acquisition now finalised, Versace — established in 1978 by Gianni Versace in Milan — becomes part of the group that owns both Prada and Miu Miu. Bertelli, who pushed for the acquisition, said the brand met two important criteria: it carried manageable financial risk and held strong global value.The transition comes shortly after Donatella Versace stepped aside as creative chief following 30 years in the position. She was succeeded by Dario Vitale, previously the design director at Miu Miu.","Lorenzo Bertelli, the son of Prada founders, is set to assume the role of executive chairman at Versace.

Dollar General surged 6.4% after posting stronger-than-expected quarterly profit as more shoppers visited its stores, while Five Below rose 0.8% after beating earnings forecasts and issuing upbeat guidance for the holiday season.Salesforce also inched up 0.7%, delivering a profit that topped expectations although its revenue fell slightly short.As per news agency AP, CEO Marc Benioff said the company was “uniquely positioned for this new era” of AI.Kroger, meanwhile, slipped 3.8% after its quarterly revenue fell below estimates. Snowflake plunged 8.6% despite beating profit and revenue forecasts, with UBS analysts noting the pressure that followed its previous blockbuster quarter, according to AP.Growth in its key product revenue segment also slowed.Market sentiment has been shaped heavily by expectations of a Federal Reserve rate cut next week — which would be the third this year — as policymakers look to support a cooling job market.Investors favour lower rates because they tend to lift asset prices, though easing too soon could reignite inflation.Fresh US labour market data released on Thursday offered mixed signals.Jobless claims fell to their lowest level in more than three years, and layoff announcements dropped sharply from October’s surge, according to figures cited by AP.The encouraging data nudged the 10-year Treasury yield up to 4.08% from 4.06%.Global markets were mixed, with European shares rising modestly and Asia showing a split trend. Japan’s Nikkei 225 jumped 2.3%, while South Korea’s Kospi slipped 0.2%.","The S&P 500 was up 0.1% in early trade and is just 0.5% shy of its all-time high.

"Turbulent times: Airbus struggles with setbacks across fleet; Boeing stages comeback, exposes industry contrast",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/turbulent-times-airbus-struggles-with-setbacks-across-fleet-boeing-stages-comeback-exposes-industry-contrast/articleshow/125764526.cms,"ANI file photo

IndiGo Crisis: Inside Pilot Shortage, Rule Change and Winter Delays Behind Over 200 Cancellations

Airbus has been grappling with a fresh wave of setbacks, highlighting the mounting strain on its sprawling but fragile supply chain.The past week offered a stark reminder that the planemaker is not immune to the production troubles affecting the wider aviation industry, where supply shortages and labour gaps persist even years after the pandemic ended.Early Wednesday, the planemaker was forced to cut its long-standing aircraft delivery target for the year after discovering that a lesser-known Spanish supplier had provided out-of-specification aircraft panels, a blow that highlighted how vulnerable the €155-billion ($181-billion) manufacturer remains to disruptions among smaller vendors.Last Friday, Airbus issued an urgent directive for a software update across approximately 6,000 A320 aircraft, its flagship fleet, after identifying a potential fault in the interface between onboard computers and the flight-control system.Three days later, Airbus revealed a quality issue involving metal panels used in the fuselage of the same jet, triggering the need for detailed inspections of more than 600 aircraft already in service or at various stages of production.“The pressures of quarterly results, sometimes the pressures of competition, probably the quality drops a little bit,” Tony Fernandes, founder of AirAsia, was quoted as saying by Bloomberg.“It’s a good warning for everybody.”The one-two setback this week rattled investors, leading to Airbus’s worst trading day since April.The contrast was especially stark as Boeing, buoyed by a renewed optimism over its financial recovery, posted its strongest stock gains in months.On Tuesday, Boeing offered a series of upbeat forecasts, from increased deliveries of its 737 and 787 jets next year to a long-awaited return to positive cash flow after years of heavy outflows. Investors welcomed the outlook, sending the US plane maker's shares up by as much as 10 per cent, as cited by Bloomberg.Boeing has been slowly pulling itself out of a years-long crisis that began in late 2018 with the first of two fatal crashes, deepened during the Covid-19 pandemic, and worsened again in early 2024 when lapses in workmanship led to another near-disaster mid-flight.The situation was compounded further late last year, when a debilitating strike brought production to a standstill for weeks and drained the company’s resources.Since then, however, the storied US manufacturer has staged a steady comeback under new CEO Kelly Ortberg, who has overhauled management and set a sharper operational direction. Boeing has also benefited from strong backing from the White House, with the US president frequently leveraging aircraft orders in global negotiations and trade discussions.Airbus’ recent setbacks are still unlikely to reach the scale of Boeing’s turmoil last year. The company has already resolved the software issue over the weekend, minimising operational disruptions, and says most of the fuselage panels under inspection are expected to be compliant.However, the revised delivery timeline will leave some airlines waiting even longer for their aircraft, even as carriers rush to upgrade their fleets to keep pace with surging global travel demand.With China’s bid to challenge the long-standing duopoly still in its early stages, the fortunes of Airbus and Boeing remain tightly intertwined.Now, as Airbus targets a monthly production rate of 75 A320-family aircraft by 2027 and Boeing boosts output of its bestselling 737, both manufacturers face the same pressure: scaling up while preserving quality and ensuring that a fragile global supply chain can support their ambitions.","Airbus has been grappling with a fresh wave of setbacks, highlighting the mounting strain on its sprawling but fragile supply chain.

1.14 lakh startups generate more than 12 lakh jobs in India: Finance ministry,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/trend-tracking/1-14-lakh-startups-generate-more-than-12-lakh-jobs-in-india-finance-ministry/articleshow/107262154.cms,"Finance Ministry

NEW DELHI: More than 1.14 lakh startups in India have created over 12 lakh jobs so far, the finance ministry said in its latest review of the Indian economy.In the report titled, ‘The Indian Economy: A Review January 2024’, the Department of Economic Affairs said that the 1.14 lakh startups recognised by the government under the 'Startup India initiative’ created more than 12 lakh jobs (as of October 2023).The state-owned e-commerce platform Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC) clocked more than 63 lakh transactions till November 2023, the document read.Despite facing global challenges in 2023 like valuation issues, few IPOs, regulatory changes and macroeconomic and geopolitical trends, India remains the third largest tech start-up ecosystem globally, with over 950 tech startups founded last year.The cumulative funding for more than 31,000 tech start ups has exceeded $70 billion (from 2019 to 2023), according to a recent report by Nasscom in collaboration with Zinnov.“In 2023, despite facing global economic and regulatory challenges, Indian tech startups have prioritised the imperative of enhancing their business fundamentals, driving profitability and growth,” said Debjani Ghosh, President, Nasscom.“The proliferation of tech startups in tier 2 and 3 cities marks the ecosystem's resilience,” she added.Navigating 2024, tech startup founders expect to continue the revenue growth path with measured steps focusing on optimising expenditure and maximising profitability for B2B tech startups.Investments in deeptech will continue an upward trend in 2024. With generative AI (GenAI) acceleration, 70 per cent of start-up founders are embedding artificial intelligence (AI) in their solutions.As funding becomes scarce for the Indian startup ecosystem in general, the explosion of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has given a new lease of life to entrepreneurs and founders in the country, as the Centre extends support to the sector.","The state-owned e-commerce platform Open Network for Digital Commerce clocked more than 63 lakh transactions till November 2023.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground.Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change, too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

E-Commerce startup Udaan to trim costs ahead of 2025 IPO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/e-commerce-startup-udaan-to-trim-costs-ahead-of-2025-ipo/articleshow/105001132.cms,"E-commerce startup Udaan is working to curb costs and forge new partnerships with consumer brands in India as it prepares to go public in 2025.Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta said in an interview. That’s set to happen around the same time as its initial public offering, he said.The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said. “Second, strategically we want to ensure that we are top of mind with shopkeepers, with big manufacturers, and we maintain our relative market share.”Lightspeed Venture Partners-backed Udaan is among startups trying to tap the rapid growth of India’s economy and consumer market, while meeting investor demands for profitability. Udaan, which at its peak employed thousands, joined fellow Indian startups in slashing jobs last year and tightening internal controls and compliance. It now has about 1,800 staff, and Gupta didn’t specify if further job cuts are needed.Corporate governance lapses at Indian online tutoring firm Byju’s, once the country’s top startup with a valuation of $22 billion, shone a light at unique challenges faced by founders in the South Asian nation and drove companies to be more diligent.“We continue to move towards more professionalized management, professionalized board and also institutionalized shareholders as we go towards public markets,” Gupta said.Udaan is yet to decide whether it will list in India or overseas. It was valued at more than $3 billion in a 2021 funding round, and was in talks to raise $400 million, Business Standard reported in September. Lightspeed owns about 35% of Udaan, while Tencent Holdings Ltd. holds 6%.The company was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart.

That business is profitable before taxes and is growing 70% annually, Gupta said.“That’s a second business in the overall umbrella of Udaan trying to organize trade in the country,” Gupta said. “In addition to commerce, financing becomes an important market opportunity.”","Udaan will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta says. Udaan competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods. The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-105001128,imgsize-151312,width-400,resizemode-4/105001128.jpg"

Space sector start-up Sisir Radar to develop SAR on L/P band SAR,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/space-sector-start-up-sisir-radar-to-develop-sar-on-l/p-band-sar/articleshow/104558111.cms,"CHENNAI: Space sector startup, Sisir Radar Private Ltd has hit success at the prestigious iDEX DefSpace Challenge with its projects for development of “L/P band Continuous Wave SAR (synthetic aperture radar) payload for LEO Small Satellites” and “Unfurlable, Electronically Steering Antenna for L/P band SAR payload” for Indian Air Force (IAF), said a top company official.The company is promoted by former Director at the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) Tapan Misra and the brains behind the Indian space agency’s RISAT series of SAR satellites as well as the Dual Frequency SAR on the Chandrayaan 2 orbiter that is currently circling the moon.""A grant of Rs 3 crore is also there for development of the products,"" Misra told IANS.Synthetic Aperture Radar or SAR is a special kind of imaging radar technology that can provide extremely accurate high resolution imagery of the terrain through clouds, smoke and dust even in pitch dark conditions. SAR imagery provides much higher resolution than other forms of remote sensing technology such as hyperspectral and multispectral. SAR is a critical technology for strategic reconnaissance and planning as well as for disaster management.According to Misra, winning the challenge in just over a year of floating the company is a major booster.He said L and P band SAR have an advantage over other frequencies (like X band) when it comes to penetration capabilities through rain, clouds, foliage and vegetation in a tropical country like India, and underground penetration capabilities in dry terrain.Continuing further, he said the L band SAR will provide 1 metre resolution, spotlight resolution in Stripmap mode. The current industry standard is 5-10 metre in L band. Misra said both the L and P band will operate simultaneously from a satellite borne SAR. Recently, Sisir Radar successfully developed and tested the world’s highest resolution L-Band SAR fitted on a drone. With 0.2 metre resolution, this is by far the highest L band SAR in the world, he said.","Space sector startup, Sisir Radar Private Ltd has hit success at the prestigious iDEX DefSpace Challenge.

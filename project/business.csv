Gold Price Outlook

Gold price prediction today: Upside in gold rates is expected to be limited with the US-China 90-day trade truce extended and other developments on the Trump trade war front.Gold prices turned volatile as a surge seen on Friday on COMEX on news of possible tariffs on imports of one-kilogram gold bars in Switzerland, threatened more turmoil in the global bullion market. But prices retreated quickly from those record highs in the current week following the White House’s announcement to address “misinformation” surrounding potential import tariffs on gold bars. The move came amid confusion in the precious metals industry and fears that a key segment of global bullion trade could be disrupted.Additionally US & China confirmed a 90-day extension of their trade truce this week, after several rounds of “productive” negotiation. Developments in US-China trade negotiations generally trended in a positive direction in recent weeks. But recent history proved trade developments can remain prolonged this year. Moving ahead trade developments in US - India remains to be watched out while on the macro front Inflationary numbers (PPI) from India & US due remain crucial to be watched to gauge trajectory of interest rate cuts in coming months.Gold seemed to lack bullish conviction during the start of the week as traders also opted to wait for the release of the US consumer inflation figures.This crucial data earlier had played a key role in influencing expectations about the Federal Reserve's (Fed) rate-cut path. Heading into the key data risk ahead, the growing acceptance that the US central bank will lower borrowing costs in September kept the USD bulls on the defensive during the start of the week. Meanwhile traders continue to price in more than 90% possibility of a 25 bps rate cut in September.Overall the latest optimism over an extension of the US-China trade truce and the US-Russia summit aimed at ending the war in Ukraine could cap the safe-haven pair major upside warranting some caution as Spot Gold could continue to find resistance in the zone of $ 3,385 – 3,410 per oz (CMP USD 3,350/oz) on the higher side.After the release of US CPI report which remains lighter than expected not enough to provide clarity on impact of higher tariffs despite slight rise in Core CPI numbers, attention could now also shift towards Producer Price Index (PPI) report (more closely followed by US Fed) due on Thursday, along with Retail Sales & the preliminary August reading of the Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index. These figures would be closely watched further while gold prices could witness increased volatility towards the end of the week.","Spot Gold could continue to find resistance in the zone of $ 3,385 – 3,410 per oz (CMP USD 3,350/oz) on the higher side.

More mop-up, bigger base

NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi 's announcement of a GST revamp is set to push states, especially those ruled by Opposition parties, to agree to the Centre's rate rationalisation plan, with the finance ministry's calculations suggesting that the exercise will result in a short-term impact on revenue, which will be more than made up in the coming months on the back of higher consumption.During ministerial meetings panel on rate rationalisation, led by Bihar deputy chief minister Samrat Chaudhary, states such as Kerala, West Bengal and Karnataka had opposed reducing the slabs or effecting major changes, fearing revenue loss, and had suggested that high-end shoes and clothing be taxed at higher rates.The Centre has, however, gone for a mammoth overhaul, seeking to simplify the regime and make it more predictable. ""The changes will provide a massive boost to consumption and support growth in collections as well as economic activity. If we introduce the tax changes around Oct , then we will make up for the hit by end of the year. We expect the typical Laffer curve impact, which will see more people coming in, and higher consumption,"" said a finance ministry official.Economist Arthur Laffer's theory suggests that excessively high and low tax rates result in low revenues and tax cuts can potentially enhance collection.While the overhaul road map has been circulated to the GoM, the Centre is hoping that based on the discussions in the panel, a meeting of the GST Council is held in Sept-Oct for the new rates to kick in ahead of Diwali. Separately, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman is expected to hold talks with the states to push for the Centre's proposal.","PM Narendra Modi's announcement of a GST revamp is set to push states, especially those ruled by Opposition parties, to agree to the Centre's rate rationalisation plan.

MUMBAI: CareEdge Ratings is positioning itself as a global player in sovereign and cross-border corporate ratings through its Gift City-based subsidiary, CareEdge Global IFSC, and is engaging with global debt issuers and institutional investors like sovereign wealth funds.""We are already among the top 10 global rating agencies when it comes to sovereign ratings by number of countries rated,"" said MD & CEO Mehul Pandya. The agency has rated 39 sovereigns and about $3 billion of debt, largely for Indian companies raising money overseas.""A country poised to become the world's third-largest economy should have its own global audit and rating firms,"" Pandya added. Domestically, the surge in bond issuance following the cut in interest rates has improved prospects for the agency.""The bond market in Q1 has grown significantly.""We had a 66% jump from Q1 last year to Q1 this year in terms of the value of debt raised in the bond market,"" said Revati Kasture, executive director CareEdge and CEO CareEdge Global.According to Kasture, IFSC, the international arm is already the fifth largest by coverage and aims to challenge conventional methodologies.

Investors see growth in single-specialty hospitals,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/investors-see-growth-in-single-specialty-hospitals/articleshow/123328226.cms,"Representative image

Next growth frontier

NEW DELHI: With traditional multi-specialty hospital chains nearing deal saturation, investors are increasingly shifting their focus on single-specialty hospitals (SSHs), which are fast emerging as the next growth frontier in India's healthcare landscape.Offering focused care, operational efficiency and faster scalability, SSHs have become particularly attractive to private equity (PE) firms, analysts told TOI. This shift is reflected in deal activity: SSHs now account for over half of all hospital transactions by volume, supported by $2.3 billion in PE investments over the past three years, according to data from Grant Thornton Bharat.Over the past decade, deal volumes in India's single-specialty hospital segment remained steady, peaking in 2023. The year 2023 saw the highest deal value of $1.2 billion, largely driven by landmark transactions such as BPEA EQT's investment in Indira IVF and Quadria's strategic investments in Maxivision and NephroPlus.Sunil Thakur, partner at Quadria Capital, says, ""Projected to more than double to $9 billion by 2028, organised single-specialty networks offer compelling economics, (>20% earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation, 20-25% return on capital employed) powered by deep specialisation and rapid access expansion.The momentum is evident from the fact that over $3.5 billion of PE capital has flowed into the segment in recent years. ""The segment is growing at a robust 24% annually - outpacing the 15-17% growth seen in multi-specialty counterparts -indicating strong investor confidence. Key specialties driving this growth include, in vitro fertilisation (IVF), women's and child care, eye care, nephrology, and oncology - each witnessing substantial deal activity.""Investor interest in the segment has remained consistent, though we are yet to see a large-value deal in 2025. Strong fundamentals, including healthy margins, better unit economics, scalability, asset-light models, and quicker break-even cycles, continue to attract both strategic and financial investors. As healthcare delivery expands beyond metro cities, single-specialty formats are increasingly seen as effective platforms for regional growth,"" says Bhanu Prakash Kalmath SJ, Partner and Healthcare Leader, Grant Thornton Bharat.Valued at approximately $15 billion, the SSH market includes an organised segment worth around $4 billion, which continues to gain scale through consolidation and network expansion. The focus on single-specialty hospitals is a global phenomenon, reflecting a broader shift towards specialised, efficient healthcare delivery, experts say.Vishal Bali, executive chairman Asia Healthcare Holdings, a platform focused on single-specialty hospitals, backed by TPG and Singapore-based GIC, says: ""We strongly believe that one of the key prescriptions to bridge India's demand-supply gap in healthcare delivery sits with SSH enterprises.""","Single-specialty hospitals (SSHs) are fast emerging as the next growth frontier in India's healthcare landscape.

IPO frenzy

BENGALURU: A five-year analysis of 25 venture capital and private equity-backed new-age companies that listed in India between May 2020 and June 2025 showed that sustained market outperformance has been rare. A whitepaper by wealth management firm Client Associates found that only 36% of IPO investors, roughly one in three, generated positive alpha over the BSE 500. The success rate was 32% for post-IPO investors, while 43% of pre-IPO investors outperformed the benchmark.While these companies often saw heavy oversubscription, with average subscription of 48.5 times, and 68% delivering first-day listing gains that averaged 24.1%, many failed to maintain those gains over time. Companies such as Zomato, Nazara Technologies and Ixigo consistently outperformed, while others saw sharp declines in value post-listing.Pre-IPO investors achieved the best risk-adjusted returns when exiting at the six-month lock-in expiry, with 52% of companies delivering positive alpha at that stage, compared to 38% for those who stayed invested longer. A group of 10 IPOs that had high retail demand in the unlisted market performed worse than the rest.For pre-IPO investors, average returns at the six-month lock-in expiry were -5%, compared with +45% for other listings. IPO investors in this subset saw -6% alpha, while post-IPO investors faced -25% alpha.The study found no consistent pattern between IPO performance and the proportion of shares sold via offer for sale (OFS) versus primary issuance. High-OFS listings such as Ixigo performed strongly, while some primary-heavy IPOs, including Ola Electric and Mobikwik, were among the weakest.According to Client Associates, the exuberance of the 2020-2021 phase, marked by abundant liquidity and growth-focused narratives, has given way to a more disciplined market in 2024-2025, where profitability, cash flow generation and capital efficiency are key investor benchmarks. The report advised selective exposure to high-quality listed new-age companies, tactical IPO participation for listing gains, avoiding retail-driven unlisted market hype and using professional fund managers for private market allocations.""India's startup IPO boom was driven more by narrative than numbers. Our analysis shows that while listing gains rewarded early risk-takers, sustained outperformance was reserved for companies built on solid fundamentals, not hype. Capital efficient growth, profitability, and business discipline are what drive long-term value,"" Nitin Aggarwal, director, Investment Research and Advisory, Client Associates, said.","A whitepaper by wealth management firm Client Associates found that only 36% of IPO investors generated positive alpha over the BSE 500.

GST 2.0

NEW DELHI: Eight years after the launch of goods and services tax, the Centre has circulated the blueprint for GST 2.0, with two main slabs of 5% for common use items and 18% for other goods as it seeks to make life simpler and less taxing for citizens and businesses. The comprehensive revamp plan - which will be discussed by a group of state finance ministers on Thursday - proposes to bring the curtains down on the 12% and 28% slabs, while ending compensation cess ahead of the March deadline, and tax sin goods at 40%.Food, medicines and medical devices, stationary and educational products and everyday essentials, such as hair oil and toothbrush, will be in the nil or 5% slabs, officials said. Items used by the middle class, such as ACs, TV sets and refrigerators will move into the 18% slab, although there was no clarity on how govt intended to tax automobiles and cement, which currently attract a 28% levy.Besides, there will be a major cut in GST on health and term insurance, which has been on the table for several months.Apart from insurance, automobiles, health, handicrafts, farm goods, textiles, fertilisers and renewable energy have been flagged among sectors with special emphasis.Reduction in slabs will end classification disputes over namkeens, parathas, buns and cakes and several other products due to varying rates on ingredients. Special rates of 0.25% on diamonds and precious stones and 3% on jewellery will be retained to promote specific industries, govt sources said while unveiling the plan.""We have suggested a very simple, well reformed, next generation GST... Broadly, tax incidence will come down because rates on bulk of the items in 12% and 28% slabs will come down,"" a senior govt official said. The plan is to move 99% of the mass-use items in 12% slab to 5% bracket, with a small set moving to 18%. The proposed changes, which need to be endorsed by the GST Council, will end the patchwork that has been going on since 2017 , with every meeting of ministers resorting to small tweaks. As a result, the weighted average tax rate, which had come down to 11.6%, will drop further.Officials explained, apart from the common man, special emphasis has been given to equipment used by farmers.","The Centre has circulated the blueprint for GST 2.0, with two main slabs of 5% for common use items and 18% for other goods.

MUMBAI: There are growing concerns about a slowdown in SUV sales following geopolitical issues, US tariffs, and IT layoffs. However, Mahindra & Mahindra, the country's largest SUV maker, remains unfazed and says that off-roaders still have a long way to go, and thus there will be no let-up in sales.Rajesh Jejurikar, CEO of Mahindra's auto and farm sectors, says SUVs will continue to power domestic car sales, possibly helping offset any chances of a major slowdown in the industry.As the company charts out an expansion plan for export markets, with unveiling of four new concept SUVs (called Vision.S, Vision.T, Vision.SXT and Vision.X), that will hit the roads from 2027, it remains confident of its strong SUV showing in India, where it has emerged as the second-best seller, behind Maruti Suzuki.""We are very optimistic because we believe that vehicles are bought as a symbol of status. Customers want vehicles which have a certain seating height and a commanding view on the road. And, in many cases, good space to take a joint family out. These are the reasons behind the rapid growth in SUV sales. We don't see any of that changing,"" Jejurikar told TOI.""A lot of the growth has come through core SUVs, which is where we have a strong presence.And we believe that is a strength which is still leverageable.""While refusing to make direct comments on US tariffs issue, Jejurikar said India's plans to sign FTAs will be beneficial for companies looking to go big on exports. ""I think FTAs are going to be a positive enabler which will allow us to leverage India's product development capability as well as the manufacturing prowess. FTAs will give us access to more markets. With that, we have to build brand and sales channels in those countries. ""On new SUVs that were showcased for export markets, he said they will be launched in a phased manner from 2027 onwards. The cars have the capability to have both electric and internal-combustion (ICE) powertrains. ""The strategy of going global is a phased, calibrated strategy. It's not like we are going to do a sudden switch one day. I want to reinforce our approach and philosophy, create products which are capable of competing with the best in the world. Then you decide at what stage you want to go global with them. And that's exactly what our approach has been on the electric origin SUVs.""In Phase 1 of export plans, the company will go to markets where it already has a brand, network and presence. These include South Africa, Australia, New Zealand, Chile, North Africa, Indonesia, and Morocco.""The second phase will be right-hand drive markets where we will start with electric vehicles. Those will be markets like the UK. The third phase will be markets, which are primarily led by our global lifestyle pickups.

Asian stocks mostly gained on Tuesday, with Japan’s Nikkei 225 (.N225) hitting a fresh all-time record high after US President Donald Trump extended a tariff truce with China for another 90 days, a move that eased trade tensions between the world’s two largest economies and steadied oil prices.The Nikkei jumped as much as 2.8 per cent, or 1,162.86 points, to 42,983.34 in the afternoon before easing back slightly, surpassing its previous record of 42,426.77 set in July last year. Heavyweight shares led the charge — SoftBank Group surged 7.07 per cent, Advantest climbed 7.34 per cent, Toyota gained 3.14 per cent, and Fast Retailing advanced 4.67 per cent. Analysts at IwaiCosmo Securities cited easing tensions over US-China trade talks and speculation over imminent US interest rate cuts as key drivers of the rally.The extension, announced Monday, staves off triple-digit duties on Chinese goods and removes one immediate risk for global markets. Trump signed an executive order delaying the planned tariff hike to allow more time for negotiations, with Beijing issuing a similar statement. Without the extension, tariffs on Chinese imports could have risen from an already steep 30 per cent.According to news agency Reuters, the truce had been largely expected by investors, who have also been buoyed in recent weeks by resilient US corporate earnings and prospects of interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve.Japan’s Nikkei was last up around 2 per cent as markets reopened after a long weekend, lifted by tech shares and tracking global gains.Australia’s benchmark index (.AXJO) also hit a record high ahead of a central bank policy meeting widely expected to deliver a 25-basis-point rate cut, with another possible by November.MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan (.MIAPJ0000PUS) was slightly higher, while China’s blue-chip CSI300 (.CSI300) was flat and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng (.HSI) dipped 0.1 per cent in early trade.“The US-China tariff truce extension preserves the status quo for now, so no immediate implications for investment markets,” Shane Oliver, chief economist and head of investment strategy at AMP in Sydney, was quoted as saying by Reuters.Oil prices also edged up as the trade extension eased concerns that escalating tariffs would weaken global economic growth and crimp fuel demand. Brent crude futures rose 26 cents, or 0.39 per cent, to $66.89 a barrel, while US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) gained 22 cents, or 0.34 per cent, to $64.18, according to Reuters.Investors are also watching the August 15 meeting between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska, aimed at negotiating an end to the war in Ukraine. “Any peace deal between Russia and Ukraine would end the risk of disruption to Russian oil that has been hovering over the market,” ANZ senior commodity strategist Daniel Hynes wrote in a note, cited by Reuters.Attention in financial markets will now shift to US consumer price inflation data due later Tuesday. Economists polled by Reuters expect July’s core CPI to rise 0.3 per cent month-on-month, faster than June’s 0.2 per cent pace. “CPI will be a key test for market tone. Softer data could give small-caps a lift, but for now, mega-caps remain firmly in control,” said Marc Velan, head of investments at Lucerne Investment Management.Money markets, according to Bloomberg, are pricing in more than two Fed rate cuts by December, with about a 90 per cent probability of a quarter-point reduction next month.However, an upside surprise in inflation could temper those expectations.","Japan’s Nikkei 225 (.N225) hit a fresh all-time record high after US President Donald Trump extended a tariff truce with China for another 90 days.

India Should Put Out That It Wont Be Intimidated by Trump's 50% Tariff, Says South Asia Expert

Why SBI has stopped Nayara transactions

Russia-backed Indian refinery Nayara Energy is faced with a fresh challenge. India’s largest public sector lender State Bank of India ( SBI ) has stopped processing international trade and forex transactions for Nayara Energy following recent US tariff hikes. The bank's decision aims to avoid any potential sanctions from the US or the European Union, a source told ET. US President Donald Trump has announced a 25% additional tariff on India for its crude oil trade with Russia.Nayara Energy was formed after the Rosneft-led purchase of Essar Oil's Vadinar refinery (20 mtpa) in August 2017. The organisation sources crude oil internationally and holds approximately 8% of India's refining capacity, which exceeds 256 MMTPA, ranking second in Asia.The company maintains a nationwide network of more than 6,500 fuel retail outlets.Also Read | Symbol of India-Russia ties takes a hard hit!

Lenders are exploring ways to ease the financial pressure on small and medium enterprises (SMEs) hit hardest by the United States’ 50% duty on imports from India.According to ET, lenders are considering scrapping certain administrative charges such as processing fees, foreign exchange hedging costs and collection charges after being nudged by the government.A government official cited by ET said that industry groups and export-oriented MSMEs had raised concerns, which were passed on to banks. “Banks have said they will provide options through these immediate relief measures,” the official said.While broad cuts in interest rates are unlikely without a government-backed subvention scheme, bankers indicated they may stop charging penal interest for missed repayment deadlines to prevent accounts from turning into bad assets.“Unless there is some sort of relief package announced, banks have limited scope to drastically bring down rates or offer systemic support,” an executive director of a state-run bank was quoted as saying by ET.The government, meanwhile, is working on a broader support plan under its proposed Export Promotion Mission. Measures being considered include customised schemes for affected sectors, redirecting exports to alternative markets, and pushing products with weak export demand into the domestic market.Exporters are also being urged to build strong Indian brands to withstand the tariff shock.Industry representatives have asked that penal interest on loans be applied only once accounts become non-performing, and that collateral requirements be aligned with the level of risk.One industry official noted that banks often refuse textile machinery as collateral, hampering loan access for textile exporters. Discussions are also underway on sector-specific credit lines with relaxed collateral rules and cheaper export factoring services.Currently, factoring services in Singapore are 10–11% cheaper than those in India, prompting many exporters to use them. MSMEs, which contribute heavily to India’s exports and employ millions, are seen as the most vulnerable to the tariff impact, particularly in sectors such as textiles.Another banker cited by ET said that they are advising clients to use the Credit Guarantee Fund Trust for Micro and Small Enterprises (CGTSME), which covers loans of up to Rs 10 crore per borrower. “We are actively pursuing this and, in some cases, handholding firms to get the Udyam registration to be eligible under the guarantee scheme,” the banker said.","Lenders are exploring ways to ease the financial pressure on small and medium enterprises (SMEs) hit hardest by the United States’ 50% duty on imports from India.

Donald Trump tariffs: Indian electronics pivot as levies push diversification; new markets eyed,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/donald-trump-tariffs-indian-electronics-pivot-as-levies-push-diversification-new-markets-eyed/articleshow/123251478.cms,"AI image

With the US set to impose steep new tariffs that industry executives say resemble the protectionist levies of the Great Depression era, Indian electronics exporters are scouting alternative markets in Europe, the Middle East and Africa.The move comes as the US, still the largest buyer of India’s electronics goods, becomes a tougher market, weighed down by tariff hikes and shifting content-origin rules. “I have been reaching out to my customers proactively. They are still issuing orders, but there are concerns about how this will pan out,” Sanjay Agarwal, managing director of Globe Capacitors, which exports about Rs 100 crore worth of materials annually to the US, was quoted as saying by ET.“I have already controlled my purchases, especially for the materials I buy only for US customers. As far as looking at alternative markets is considered, that is always on the horizon”, he added.While most electronics exports, including smartphones, currently remain exempt from both the 25% tariffs imposed by US President Donald Trump and the additional 25% set to take effect from August 26, these exemptions are under review.They hinge on a US commerce department section 232 investigation mandated under the Trade Expansion Act, 1962, with findings expected in the coming weeks, according to ET.Rajoo Goel, secretary general of the Electronic Industries Association of India (ELCINA), said about 75–80% of India’s electronics exports are shielded from the new 50% tariff regime, but the remainder, including PCB assemblies, telecom gear, consumer products and power electronics, will feel the pinch. “For these products, our value addition is higher and would impact several domestic companies, including MSMEs,” Goel said, as per ET.US-bound electronics exports from India jumped 43.5% to $15.89 billion in FY25. Smartphones led the surge, accounting for $10.56 billion, up 89% from the previous year and made up 66% of all electronics exports to the US. “We are monitoring the situation closely and are looking at other markets for our products. For mobile phones, the Middle East and Africa are coming up as important destinations and for lighting, Europe is a market we are evaluating,” said an executive at an electronic manufacturing services (EMS) firm.Assembled photovoltaic cells (PVC) modules, the second-largest category, fell 32.7% to $1.81 billion in FY25 due to tighter curbs on imported units. Other exports included electronic instruments ($1.4 billion), computer hardware such as laptops ($154 million), and consumer electronics like cameras ($115 million).For the roughly $2 billion worth of electronics exports to the US beyond smartphones and PVC modules, there are ample alternative markets, according to Amrit Manwani, chairman of EMS major Sahasra Group. “Exporters should explore Europe, Australia, South East Asia, and given the geopolitical realignment, even Russia.Many firms may have to adapt and establish partial or full manufacturing in the US given its predominance as a market, if things don’t ease,” Manwani said. Another EMS executive was quoted as saying by ET that companies need to focus on “demand resilience” in addition to supply chain resilience.“Companies will have to look at other markets like the Middle East, Europe, Latin America and Africa. It is an opportunity for Indian companies to go beyond the US and deepen their presence in other countries as well,” the executive said.","US-bound electronics exports from India jumped 43.5% to $15.89 billion in FY25.

Trump-Putin 'long overdue' meet



Tariffs on India over Russian oil prompted talks?

US President Donald Trump said he may consider imposing tariffs on countries purchasing Russian oil “in two or three weeks,” though not immediately, following his meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska.""When you talked before coming here about the consequences for Vladimir Putin being severe, I found that interesting.Severe would be defined by me- India doesn't buy your oil, The European Union won't buy it. And why in the back of my head was I thinking, wait a minute, Donald Trump just delayed a possible increase in tariffs on China. Why do I think that probably President Trump was thinking ahead, that maybe if you had to, that would have been part of the consequences?"" Trump was asked by Fox News' Sean Hannity.“Well, because of what happened today, I think I don’t have to think about that,” Trump said in response during the interview after the talks. “Now, I may have to think about it in two weeks or three weeks or something, but we don’t have to think about that right now. I think, you know, the meeting went very well,"" he added.Also read: Donald Trump’s blunt message to Volodymyr Zelenskyy after meeting Vladimir Putin; shifts 'onus' on Ukraine US president Donald Trump and Russian president Vladimir Putin held a three-hour closed-door meeting in Alaska, their first high-level encounter since Trump took office.While no agreements were signed and the joint press conference lasted only a few minutes, both leaders projected cautious optimism about the future of US–Russia ties and the conflict in Ukraine.Putin, speaking first, called the talks “long overdue” and said relations had “fallen to the lowest point since the Cold War.” He stressed the need to shift from confrontation to dialogue and highlighted Ukraine as a central topic, expressing hope that “the Ukrainians and Europeans choose to not throw a wrench in” the peace process.Trump described the discussions as “very productive,” saying progress had been made on several issues but acknowledging that major sticking points remain. He reiterated his familiar stance that “there’s no deal until there’s a deal,” and said he would consult NATO leaders and Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy before any next steps.The summit ended without breakthroughs or any peace deal with regards to Ukraine. Putin made a remark about a next meet (if any) saying, “Next time in Moscow.""Before the talks, Trump claimed that the tariffs imposed on India for its oil purchases from Russia have played a significant role in prompting Moscow to seek the meeting with Washington.According to Trump, Russia is concerned about losing its ""second largest customer"" for oil, which influenced its decision to engage in dialogue with the US. China remains the largest buyer of Russian oil.The comments came just ahead of a highly anticipated meeting between Trump and Putin. In an interview with Fox News on Thursday, Trump had said, ""I think everything has an impact,"" suggesting that the tariffs have effectively deterred India from buying oil from Russia.""When you lose your second largest customer, and you're probably going to lose your first largest customer, I think that probably has a role,"" the US President further said.However, despite Trump's claims, India has maintained that it has not halted its oil purchases from Russia. Indian officials have emphasized that their oil buying decisions are based solely on economic considerations. Last week, Trump announced an additional 25 percent tariff on US imports from India, raising the overall duty to 50 percent, to take effect on August 27; adding a further penalty which has not been defined as of now.In response to the US tariffs, ministry of external affairs has described the targeting of India as unjustified and unreasonable. The ministry emphasized that India, like any major economy, will take all necessary measures to safeguard its national interests and economic security.Trump has been criticising India's purchasing of Russian oil, claiming it is ""fuelling"" Russia's war machine.","US President Donald Trump and Russian president Vladimir Putin held a three-hour closed-door meeting in Alaska.

Another tariff hit: Donald Trump signals levies on chips and steel; semiconductor duties may hit 300%,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/another-tariff-hit-donald-trump-signals-levies-on-chips-and-steel-semiconductor-duties-may-hit-300/articleshow/123323616.cms,"US President Donald Trump is loading another tariff bullet, this time aimed at semiconductor chips and steel.The move, expected to be announced in the coming weaks, could shake the already rattled global trade.“I’ll be setting tariffs next week and the week after on steel and on, I would say, chips,” Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One on Friday, as he travelled to Alaska for a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin.He said the rates would start lower to give companies time to ramp up manufacturing in the US, before rising steeply, similar to his approach on pharmaceuticals.“I'm going to have a rate that is going to be lower at the beginning - that gives them a chance to come in and build - and very high after a certain period of time,” Reuters cited the US President.Trump further expressed confidence that firms would choose to manufacture domestically rather than face hefty duties. Earlier in February, Trump increased tariffs on steel and aluminium to 25%, then doubled them to 50% in May to support US manufacturers. It remains unclear if his latest comments signal another increase for the metals.Last week, Trump said he would impose a 100% tariff on semiconductors, with exemptions for companies committed to building in the US.The US president hinted the rate on imported chips could be even higher. “I’m going to have a rate that is going to be 200%, 300%?” he said, as quoted by Bloomberg.The White House has yet to explain how such exemptions would work, though Trump suggested Apple, which has pledged a $600 billion domestic manufacturing initiative, could benefit. Manufacturers and AI firms have been pressing for clarity, as chips are integral to a vast range of consumer products.Both semiconductors and pharmaceuticals have been under US commerce department investigation since April, a required step before tariffs can be imposed on national security grounds, a process that can drag on for months, Bloomberg reported.Trump also signalled that trade could be on the agenda with Putin. “I noticed he’s bringing a lot of business people from Russia, and that’s good I like that because they want to do business,” Trump said. “But they’re not doing business until we get the war settled,” he said.In recent weeks, Trump has threatened new tariffs on Russian energy buyers, including a 50% levy on goods from India, and warned that Moscow could face higher economic costs if his meeting with Putin does not go well.","US President Donald Trump says he will set tariffs on semiconductor chips and steel.

Affordability vs returns

When Oakland resident Terrence Dwyer got a flyer advertising a solar system small enough to fit on his deck — and that plugs into a regular wall socket — he didn’t hesitate. “Absolutely, let’s do this right away,” he said.Such “plug-in” or “balcony” solar kits, long popular in Europe for their affordability and easy installation, are now gaining traction in the US, AP reported. The momentum is expected to build as President Donald Trump’s budget package ends residential rooftop solar tax credits, potentially shifting interest to cheaper, smaller alternatives.Dwyer’s $2,000 setup — two 400-watt panels, an inverter, smart meter and circuit breaker — saves him about $35 a month on power bills. “We like the environmental benefits of solar and wanted to engage with solar in some fashion,” he said. A comparable rooftop system would have cost him $20,000 plus $30,000 in roof upgrades.US adoption has been slower than Europe’s due to patchy utility rules, low awareness and limited availability. Some utilities require the same interconnection paperwork as rooftop systems, despite plug-in models being designed to prevent power flowing back into the grid.In March, Utah became the first state to pass a law exempting small plug-in systems from interconnection agreements while mandating safety certification. Republican state Rep. Raymond Ward, who sponsored the bill, said: “Europe has these things. You can go buy them and they work… there is no reason why we shouldn’t have them here.”California-based nonprofit Bright Saver, which sold Dwyer his kit, also offers a $399 model that sold out in six days. “The interest and demand have been overwhelming,” said co-founder Cora Stryker. Bright Saver and others are lobbying more states for supportive legislation.Experts say savings vary widely. UC Berkeley’s Severin Borenstein estimates a $2,000 US kit costs roughly $0.20/kWh over 25 years — viable mainly in areas with high utility rates. In Europe, where kits cost around $600, the equivalent rate is $0.05–$0.06/kWh.Baltimore engineer Craig Keenan installed a $399 Bright Saver kit on his balcony in July. “I’m interested in renewable energy because the amount of carbon emissions we produce is unsustainable,” he said. It will save him about $40 annually and took just 15 minutes to set up.Texas-based Craftstrom has sold about 2,000 kits since 2021, mostly in California, Texas and Florida. China’s EcoFlow plans to enter Utah before expanding to other states. “This is an example of technology being ahead of regulators,” said EcoFlow’s Ryan Oliver.Analysts expect demand to accelerate as rooftop solar credits expire. “Utilities prefer everyone being a predictable and generous consumer,” said UCLA’s Robert Cudd. “Plug-in solar changes that.”","'plug-in' or 'balcony' solar kits are now gaining traction in the US. momentum is expected to build as President Donald Trump’s budget package ends residential rooftop solar tax credits.

Shoppers in the US kept up a healthy pace of spending in July, particularly at auto dealerships, even as President Donald Trump's tariffs began taking a toll on jobs and pushed some prices higher.Retail sales rose 0.5% last month, slowing from a revised 0.9% in June, according to the Commerce Department’s report released Friday. The July pace matched economists’ estimates. June’s figure had been revised upward, AP reported.The gains came after two straight months of declines — a 0.1% dip in April and a 0.9% fall in May. Excluding auto sales, which have been volatile since Trump imposed tariffs on many foreign-made cars, sales rose 0.3%. Auto sales jumped 1.6%, returning to more normal spending levels after a March-April surge, when buyers rushed to beat Trump’s 25% duty on imported cars and parts, followed by a slump. Samuel Tombs, chief US economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the pattern reflected that early rush and subsequent slowdown.The report showed broad-based spending gains. Clothing store sales climbed 0.7%, online retailers gained 0.8%, and home furnishings and furniture stores rose 1.4%.Electronics store sales fell 0.6%, while restaurants — the lone services component in the Census Bureau report and a key discretionary spending gauge — slipped 0.4% as more shoppers opted to eat at home to cut costs.Spending resilience comes even as Trump’s tariffs slow hiring and raise prices. Earlier this month, the Labor Department reported US employers added just 73,000 jobs in July, far below the 115,000 expected, as trade policies rattled businesses and dented economic outlook.A separate government report Tuesday showed inflation was unchanged in July, with rising prices for some imports offset by cheaper gas and groceries. Consumer prices rose 2.7% from a year earlier, matching June’s pace and up from a post-pandemic low of 2.3% in April. Core prices, excluding food and energy, rose 3.1%, up from 2.9% in June — both above the Federal Reserve’s 2% target.On a monthly basis, prices rose 0.2% in July, down from 0.3% in June, while core prices ticked up 0.3% from 0.2%. Slower rent increases and lower fuel prices appear to be offsetting some tariff effects. Many companies are still absorbing much of the added costs from Trump’s 10% universal tariff imposed in April and higher duties on countries including China and Canada.That could soon change. The Labor Department said Thursday its producer price index — measuring inflation before it reaches consumers — jumped 0.9% from June, the biggest monthly gain in over three years. Wholesale prices were up 3.3% from a year earlier, both figures exceeding forecasts.The data come as major retailers such as Walmart and Target prepare to release fiscal second-quarter earnings next week. Analysts will look for signs of how much of the tariff costs are being passed on to consumers and assess consumer sentiment ahead of the fall and winter shopping seasons.In May, Walmart warned that banana prices from Costa Rica had risen from 50 cents to 54 cents a pound and that more significant price impacts would emerge in June and July. Chief financial officer John David Rainey told The Associated Press he expected car seats from China priced at $350 could cost customers an extra $100.Several other companies, including Procter & Gamble, e.l.f. Cosmetics, Black & Decker, and Ralph Lauren, have told investors they have raised or plan to raise prices. Eyewear retailer Warby Parker is taking a selective approach, lifting prices only on premium products to offset tariff costs.Warby Parker has been reducing its reliance on China, targeting a year-end goal of keeping the share of goods sourced there under 15%. Still, the company faces higher tariffs from other countries.Executives said they plan to keep the $95 option but will increase prices for certain lens types, focusing more on older customers who need progressive lenses. Progressives, trifocals, and bifocals account for about 40% of prescription sales industrywide, but only 23% of Warby Parker’s business. These lenses are the company’s most expensive offerings and carry the highest margins.“We were able to quickly roll out select strategic price increases that have benefited our growth,” said Neil Blumenthal, co-chairman, co-founder, and co-CEO of Warby Parker.","Retail sales rose 0.5% last month, slowing from a revised 0.9% in June.

Asian stock markets showed a mixed performance on Friday, with strong Japanese growth figures offset by weaker Chinese data, while oil prices slipped ahead of a high-stakes US-Russia summit on Ukraine.As per news agency AFP, Japan’s economy expanded by 0.3% in the April-June quarter, surpassing forecasts, while the previous quarter’s output was revised upwards, helping the world’s fourth-largest economy avoid a technical recession.The growth came despite tariffs imposed by US President Donald Trump on Japanese imports, including cars, an industry that provides around 8% of Japan’s jobs. The Nikkei 225 rose nearly 1% in morning trade, while markets in Shanghai, Seoul, and Sydney also edged higher.However, Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index dropped for a second straight session after China’s July retail sales and industrial production grew at a slower pace than expected.Reuters noted that the CSI 300 index erased early gains, reflecting ongoing concerns about China’s prolonged real estate slump, high youth unemployment, and weak consumer sentiment, pressures worsened by the US-China trade war.On Wall Street, stocks ended largely flat on Thursday after strong US producer price inflation dampened hopes of a larger interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve next month.“What it did was to get rid of all the chat about a 50 basis point cut,” said Mike Houlahan of Electus Financial, as quoted by Reuters.Markets are now pricing in a 92% chance of a quarter-point cut, with no expectations of a half-point move.Oil prices eased in Asian trade, reversing Thursday’s gains. According to AFP, traders are cautious ahead of Friday’s Alaska summit between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin. Stephen Schork of the Schork Group warned that a failed meeting could lead to “stronger sanctions on Russian oil, making it much more difficult for this oil to get to the market.”Key regional indices at 0230 GMT showed Tokyo’s Nikkei 225 up 0.9% at 43,036.46, Shanghai Composite up 0.3% at 3,675.05, Hang Seng down 1.1% at 25,236.62, and Brent crude slipping 0.1% to $66.76 per barrel.","Japan's economy expanded by 0.3% in the April-June quarter, surpassing forecasts.

Japan recorded modest economic growth in the April–June quarter, overcoming the pressure of steep US tariffs, official figures showed on Friday.Preliminary data from the Cabinet Office indicated that gross domestic product (GDP) grew 0.3% from the previous quarter, outpacing market expectations of 0.1%. The January–March reading was also revised up to 0.1% growth from a previous estimate of contraction, avoiding what could have been a technical recession.On an annualised basis, the economy expanded 1%, higher than forecasts of 0.4% and following 0.6% growth in the prior quarter, reported news agency AFP.Economists polled by Reuters had anticipated a weaker performance, but robust exports, which contributed 0.3 percentage points to GDP after a sharp drop in Q1, helped support the uptick, according to CNBC. Japan’s trade deficit also narrowed in the second quarter.The improvement offers some relief to Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, whose political future has been under strain after his coalition lost its majority in the upper house in July.“This is a welcome sign, but the economy still faces many downside risks,” said Yoshiki Shinke of Dai-ichi Life Research Institute, as quoted by AFP, cautioning that export volumes could come under pressure if automakers adjust pricing to offset tariffs.Japan’s auto sector, a key employer and export driver, has been hit by US duties of up to 27.5%. A recent trade agreement reduced the rate on cars to 15%, but the change has not yet taken effect. Toyota has warned of a $9.5 billion tariff impact this year, while Honda and Sony have scaled back their earlier loss projections.The Bank of Japan recently upgraded its 2025 fiscal growth forecast to 0.6% but warned that global trade tensions and weakening overseas economies could weigh on corporate profits.Analysts, including Marcel Thieliant of Capital Economics, expect growth to slow in the coming quarters, with inflation pressures likely prompting the BoJ to resume tightening in October.","Japan recorded modest economic growth in the April–June quarter.

The long-term rate declined from 6.63% last week, while a year ago it averaged 6.49%, AP reported.Borrowing costs on 15-year fixed-rate mortgages, favoured by homeowners refinancing loans, also eased to 5.71% from 5.75% last week, compared with 5.66% in the June 2024 quarter, Freddie Mac said.Economists attributed the decline to a combination of market expectations and recent economic data. “Homebuyers who have been relegated to the sidelines by high financing costs got some encouragement in the past two weeks, but it remains to be seen if it’s enough to get more of them back in the game,” said Joel Berner, senior economist at Realtor.com.Mortgage applications jumped 10.9% last week, largely driven by refinancing activity, which accounted for nearly 47% of all submissions and caused a 23% surge in total refi applications compared to the prior week—the strongest since April. Adjustable-rate mortgage applications rose 25% to their highest level since 2022, the Mortgage Bankers Association reported.The latest decline marks the fourth consecutive week of easing rates, bringing the average 30-year mortgage to its lowest level since October 24, when it averaged 6.54%.Mortgage pricing is influenced by the 10-year Treasury yield, which was at 4.29% midday Thursday, slightly up from 4.24% late Wednesday.The recent trend follows weaker-than-expected July US job data, which fuelled speculation that the Federal Reserve may cut its short-term interest rate next month. Analysts noted that a rate cut could stimulate the job market and broader economy but may also push inflation higher, a concern compounded by tariffs under President Trump’s policies.Economists generally expect 30-year mortgage rates to remain above 6% this year, though forecasts from Realtor.com and Fannie Mae suggest an easing to around 6.4% by year-end.The Mortgage Bankers Association reported a 10.9 per cent rise in mortgage applications last week. Most of the increase came from refinancing, which made up 47 per cent of all applications and surged 23 per cent from the previous week, marking the strongest refi week since April.

"PPI spike: US producer prices inflation hit 3-year high in July, tariffs add pressure on businesses",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/ppi-spike-us-producer-prices-inflation-hit-3-year-high-in-july-tariffs-add-pressure-on-businesses/articleshow/123307757.cms,"Trump’s Worst Nightmare? India & China Join Forces To Crush American Hegemony Amid Tariff War

US producer price inflation surged in July to its highest level since 2022, with fresh signs that President Donald Trump’s tariffs are driving up business costs, official data showed Thursday.The producer price index (PPI) jumped 0.9% month-on-month after being flat in June, according to the Department of Labor, AFP reported. The figure far exceeded the 0.2% rise forecast by Briefing.com analysts, pushing the annual PPI to 3.3%.Much of the increase came from services, which rose 1.1%—the biggest jump since March 2022—while goods costs climbed 0.7%. “The advance was broad-based in July, but more than three-quarters can be traced to services,” the Labor Department said, noting that trade services, a volatile category linked to wholesaler and retailer margins, drove much of the gain.Economists said the headline increase may be overstated by volatile components, but underlying price pressures are evident, particularly in goods exposed to tariffs. Trump’s 10% levy on most trading partners, along with steeper duties on sectors like steel and aluminium, has been squeezing margins.“Input costs for producers jumped in July as price pressures for businesses build from compounding tariff impacts,” said Ben Ayers, senior economist at Nationwide.“While businesses have assumed the majority of tariff costs increases so far, margins are being increasingly squeezed by higher costs for imported goods.”Ayers noted sharp recent price gains in steel and aluminium—both targeted with 50% levies—and in food products, which accounted for 40% of the goods price increase in July.Matthew Martin, senior US economist at Oxford Economics, warned that “tariff-exposed goods are rising at a rapid clip, indicating that the willingness and ability of businesses to absorb tariff costs may be beginning to wane.”For now, the effects on consumer inflation remain limited, with the consumer price index steady at 2.7% in July. But weaker-than-estimated hiring data has raised expectations of a September interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve.Martin said the PPI figures “provide a counter-balance” to the softer employment numbers and underscore the Fed’s policy challenge. “The big picture remains that inflation is further away from the Fed’s target than the unemployment rate and is likely to climb further over the coming months. The path forward will have to traverse a tight rope between the next employment and price reports,” he added.","US producer price inflation surged in July to its highest level since 2022.

Wall Street retreated from record levels on Thursday after US government data showed wholesale inflation rose more than expected last month, dimming hopes for imminent interest rate cuts.The S&P 500 slipped 0.2% from its all-time high set on Wednesday, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 104 points, or 0.2%, and the Nasdaq composite eased 0.1% from its record in early trading, AP reported.The US Labor Department reported that prices at the wholesale level jumped 3.3% year-on-year in July, sharply higher than economists’ forecast of 2.5%. Analysts warned the increase could signal higher consumer prices ahead as costs filter through the economy.The hotter-than-expected data prompted traders to reassess expectations for a September interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve. CME Group data showed a 5% probability the Fed could keep rates unchanged next month, compared to near-certainty of a cut a day earlier.“This doesn’t slam the door on a September rate cut,” said Chris Larkin, managing director, trading and investing, at E-Trade from Morgan Stanley. “But it may raise a bit of doubt.”The inflation reading came after a more encouraging consumer price update earlier in the week. Separately, weekly jobless claims fell, signalling layoffs remain low despite tighter job openings. A resilient labour market could also give the Fed less incentive to cut rates in the short term.Treasury yields rose after the data, with the 10-year yield climbing to 4.26% from 4.20%.On the corporate front, Tapestry slumped 16.9% after the Coach and Kate Spade parent warned tariffs and duties could shave $160 million off annual profit. The company’s profit outlook missed estimates, even as revenue guidance exceeded expectations.

In response, US President Donald Trump fired Bureau of Labour Statistics (BLS) chief Erika McEntarfer, accusing her without evidence of manipulating the data.He has since nominated E.J. Antoni, chief economist at the conservative Heritage Foundation, to lead the agency. The BLS does not produce the weekly jobless claims report, AP reported.Beyond the political shake-up, the numbers suggest a more challenging job market. Job openings fell to 7.4 million in June from 7.7 million in May, and the quits rate a gauge of worker confidence, dropped to its lowest since December.Major employers including Microsoft, Google, Meta, Starbucks, CNN, Intel, and Disney have all announced job cuts this year.Economists say the slowdown is being fueled partly by uncertainty over Trump’s trade policies, as his staggered tariffs on US trading partners have weighed on business expansion plans.Adding to the pressure, the new government data released on Thursday showed that US wholesale inflation jumped unexpectedly last month, signaling that the import taxes are driving costs higher.","Jobless claims for the week ending August 9 fell by 3,000 to 224,000.

Bitcoin surged to a fresh all-time high in early Asian trade on Thursday, crossing $124,000 for the first time, supported by upbeat US market sentiment and policy changes favouring the cryptocurrency sector.According to AFP, the world’s largest digital asset briefly touched $124,500 before easing back, breaking its previous record set in July. The rally came on the heels of Wall Street gains, with the S&P 500 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq both hitting new highs this week.Analysts say recent US regulatory shifts under President Donald Trump have played a central role in Bitcoin’s rise. Samer Hasn, senior market analyst at XS.com, was quoted as saying by AFP that “the crypto market is enjoying a period of highly favourable fundamentals” as Trump has rolled back restrictions that had previously discouraged banks from working with crypto firms.He added that Trump could move to “accelerate the integration of cryptocurrencies into the national financial system”, given his and his family’s growing involvement in the sector.Large institutional buyers, often called “whales”, have added further momentum, with companies like Trump’s media group and Elon Musk’s Tesla purchasing significant amounts of Bitcoin.On Wednesday evening in New York, it rose past $123,500, surpassing the July 14 peak of $123,205.12.The rally has been supported by expectations of a US interest rate cut in September after inflation data met forecasts, encouraging investors to shift capital from blue-chip stocks into riskier digital assets.Ben Kurland, CEO at DYOR, was quoted by Bloomberg as saying that moderating inflation, anticipated rate cuts and “unprecedented institutional participation through ETFs” have created a strong tailwind.He noted that, unlike previous surges, this one is being driven by structural buying from asset managers, corporates and even sovereign entities, rather than just retail speculation.","The world’s largest digital asset briefly touched $124,500 before easing back, breaking its previous record set in July.

Asian shares moved in a tight range on Thursday, pausing after three days of gains fuelled by growing expectations that the US Federal Reserve will cut interest rates next month.Japanese stocks pulled back from record levels, while South Korea and Australia advanced.Japan’s Nikkei 225 fell 0.31% and the broader Topix dropped 0.64%, reversing from Wednesday’s all-time high close. South Korea’s Kospi gained 0.39% while the small-cap Kosdaq was flat.In Australia, the S&P/ASX 200 rose 0.49% after official data showed the country’s unemployment rate eased to 4.2% in July, in line with economists’ forecasts, down from 4.3% in June.Employment rose by 24,500 last month, slightly below expectations of a 25,000 increase, as per news agency Reuters. The Australian dollar climbed to its highest level since late July on the news.Chinese equities were also in focus after a US-listed gauge of mainland stocks rose for a second session, supported by Tencent’s latest earnings, Bloomberg reported. In the US, stocks closed at record highs overnight, led by Apple and Amazon, while Bitcoin hit a fresh all-time peak.Market sentiment is being underpinned by bets that the Fed will deliver a quarter-point cut in September, with CME FedWatch data putting the probability at nearly 100%.Bloomberg quoted Ulrike Hoffmann-Burchardi of UBS Global Wealth Management as saying, “As the labour market continues to weaken, we think the US central bank will resume interest rate cuts next month, with 25-basis-point cuts at each meeting through January 2026 for a total of 100 basis points. ”US treasury secretary Scott Bessent has gone further, suggesting a 50 basis-point reduction could be on the table, and arguing the Fed’s benchmark rate should be at least 1.5 percentage points lower. “We could go into a series of rate cuts here, starting with a 50 basis-point rate cut in September,” he said on Bloomberg Television.Meanwhile, oil prices edged higher, recovering from a sharp drop the previous day. Brent crude rose 28 cents, or 0.43%, to $65.91 a barrel, while US West Texas Intermediate added 23 cents, or 0.37%, to $62.89, according to Reuters.Prices were supported by expectations of lower US interest rates, which could boost energy demand, and geopolitical risks surrounding an upcoming meeting between US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin on August 15.Trump has warned of “very severe consequences” if Putin fails to agree to a ceasefire in Ukraine during talks in Alaska on Friday. As per Reuters, analysts at Rystad Energy noted in a client report that “the uncertainty of US-Russia peace talks continues to add a bullish risk premium given Russian oil buyers could face more economic pressure.”However, gains in crude were capped by bearish signals from supply data and forecasts. US crude inventories unexpectedly rose by 3 million barrels last week, against expectations of a small draw, according to the US Energy Information Administration.In addition, the International Energy Agency forecast that global oil supply growth in 2025 and 2026 will outpace earlier projections as OPEC+ and other producers ramp up output.","Japanese stocks pulled back from record levels, while South Korea and Australia advanced.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain and boost vendor partnerships ahead of a stock market debut planned for 2025.The Series E round was done via a combination of fresh equity and conversion of debt, the Bangalore-based company said in a statement Thursday. The round was led by M&G Plc and existing investors including Lightspeed Venture Partners and DST Global participated.The round “fully funds our business plan,” Vaibhav Gupta, Udaan co-founder and chief executive officer, said in the statement. “It enables our continued journey of growth and profitability, positioning us well to be public-market ready in the next 12-18 months.”Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, runs an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business, though a very small part of India’s overall retail market, is expected to swell to $150 billion in sales in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co.The startup targets an initial public offering in 2025, though it’s yet to decide whether it will do so in India or overseas, Gupta told Bloomberg News last month.Udaan was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran the company until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021.

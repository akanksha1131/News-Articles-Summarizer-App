UPS vs NPS: Only 1 lakh of 23L govt employees switch to Unified Pension Scheme; request deadline extension,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/ups-vs-nps-only-1-lakh-of-23l-govt-employees-switch-to-unified-pension-scheme-request-deadline-extension/articleshow/124228780.cms,"Why are workers struggling to choose?

Eventually…





The government is considering whether to extend the September 30 deadline to switch to the UPS as barely 1 lakh out of 23 lakh government employees have opted.Several employees’ associations have written to the cabinet secretary, seeking a two-month extension to allow more staff to switch from the National Pension Scheme (NPS) to the UPS or the Unified Pension Scheme Earlier on Monday, representatives from associations met ministry officials to present their case, as per an ET report.Senior officials from the finance, pension, and other departments held late-night discussions on Monday to consider the request, following the previous extension granted on June 30.The UPS, launched in March, is the government’s flagship pension reform, aiming to balance the market-linked NPS with the old pension system that placed it under a heavy burden, according to ET.However, uptake has been low due to concerns over financial security, a 25-year service requirement for full benefits, and a strict definition of eligible family members.To ease these concerns, the government introduced the Central Civil Services (Implementation of the Unified Pension Scheme under the National Pension System) Rules, 2025, with several incentives.Full pension benefits are now available after 20 years of service, instead of 25, a move that particularly benefits paramilitary personnel who often retire early.The scheme also offers better financial protection for employees’ families in case of disability or death.Despite these changes, many employees are struggling to understand the new rules, especially those in remote areas. As of last week, only around one lakh staff had opted for the UPS, despite the government’s outreach across departments, the financial daily reported.In a September 25 letter, the National Council of the Joint Consultative Machinery highlighted the communication gaps and procedural delays.A substantial number of eligible employees may end up missing the UPS option, which closes on September 30, the Council wrote, requesting at least a two-month extension so staff have sufficient time to make their choice.","Only 1 lakh out of 23 lakh government employees have opted for the UPS.

MUMBAI: India Inc’s credit profile improved in the first half of FY26,with rating upgrades continuing to outpace downgrades across agencies. The improvement in credit profile was driven by resilient domestic demand and govt-driven infrastructure spending, offsetting the drag from escalating US tariffs.Credit rating agencies—CareEdge, ICRA, Crisil, and India Ratings (Ind-Ra)—said credit quality remained robust, aided by strong balance sheets, cautious capital allocation, and supportive local conditions.CareEdge’s credit ratio (ratio of upgrades to downgrades) improved to 2.6 times in H1, from 2.4 times in H2 of FY25. ICRA reported a sharper rise, with a 2.9 ratio, while Crisil stood at 2.2. Ind-Ra’s downgrade-to-upgrade ratio stayed rangebound at 0.3. Reaffirmations were broadly steady, with CareEdge and Crisil noting stable shares of portfolios unchanged. “Corporate India’s strong economic moat, developed since the pandemic, continues to safeguard credit profiles against relentless geopolitical and economic uncertainties,” said Arvind Rao, senior director at Ind-Ra.The pattern of upgrades and downgrades pointed to a two-speed economy. Infrastructure dominated the upgrades, reflecting Govt-led capex and policy support.","The improvement in credit profile was driven by resilient domestic demand and govt-driven infrastructure spending, offsetting the drag from escalating US tariffs.

NEW DELHI: A new era in online gaming begins from Wednesday with new law — that prohibits money games — coming into play. The Promotion and Regulation of Online Gaming Act 2025, which was passed by the Parliament in Aug, will become effective from Oct 1.The gaming industry, which earned nearly all its revenue from money play before the new law banned it, has pivoted to various new areas in line with the legislation that was brought in to control the spate of suicides across many states by players who lost money. Also, govt felt that online money platforms were being used for illegal practices such as money laundering and terror financing.IT minister Ashwini Vaishnaw has said that while money games are moving out, the industry still has high potential with govt’s focus on promoting eSports and social games.The minister had earlier said that online money gaming had become a serious social and public health issue, with proven significant negative impact on society, as he emphasised that eSports and social gaming will help India emerge as a global game development hub.“We have observed instances of money laundering as well as terror support. And that’s why we have kept it.... This was clearly visible to the industry also. Had they taken good and effective steps to prevent the harm, obviously things would have been different,” the minister had told TOI. Top gaming companies such as Dream11 , Games24x7, MPL, and WinZO have since discontinued money games and have moved into new areas for audience connect.","The gaming industry, which earned nearly all its revenue from money play before the new law banned it, has pivoted to various new areas in line with the legislation.

Govt notifies new payments board

RBI’s liquidity norms revised





MUMBAI: Public sector banks must build forward-looking capital buffers aligned to their risk profile and growth ambitions rather than simply meeting regulatory minimums, Reserve Bank of India deputy governor Swaminathan J told public sector bankers. The deputy governor said that that there is a need for PSBs to protect their resilience at the time when the economy is facing global headwinds.“Asset quality must also be managed with a preventive mindset, using early warning systems and predictive analytics to identify stress before it becomes a crisis,” he said.Speaking at PSB Manthan 2025 in New Delhi on Sept 12, Swaminathan underlined the need for strong banks at a time of global uncertainty. “We meet today at a time when the global environment remains marked by uncertainty. Geopolitical tensions, shifting trade alignments, climate transitions, and rapid technological disruptions are reshaping the contours of growth and finance worldwide. Yet, amidst these headwinds, the Indian economy continues to demonstrate resilience and stability,” he said.He cautioned against complacency. “Periods of comfort, however, can create the risk of complacency and mistakes are typically made in good times.Therefore, the challenge before PSBs today is not only to stay clear of the earlier shortcomings but to build on the gains of the past decade and transform themselves further,” he warned, adding that banks must remain “strong, adaptable, and future-ready” to contribute meaningfully to the vision of a Viksit Bharat by 2047.Govt has notified the constitution of a Payments Regulatory Board to replace the RBI’s internal payments board. This follows amendments to payment laws in May. Chaired by the RBI governor, the board includes the deputy governor and executive director in charge of payments, the financial services and MeitY secretarties; and Aruna Sundararajan as an external member. The RBI’s principal legal adviser will attend as a permanent invitee.Reserve Bank of India has revised its liquidity framework to keep short-term interest rates more predictable and ensure that rate decisions are quickly transmitted. While the overnight weighted average call rate will remain the operating target, changes include replacing 14-day variable rate repo and reverse repo operations with predominantly seven-day tenors and providing at least one day’s advance notice for liquidity operations.",Public sector banks must build forward-looking capital buffers aligned to their risk profile and growth ambitions.

Exception or extension





MUMBAI: As the Reserve Bank of India-mandated listing deadline for Tata Sons expired, all eyes are on the regulator’s stance concerning the holding company of India’s largest conglomerate, the Tata Group Although Tata Sons had applied to RBI to surrender its core investment company (CIC) registration to avoid the listing mandate, the banking regulator has not yet come out with a decision on its application.In response to an RTI query, RBI had said that Tata Sons’ application was under consideration.Sources indicate that Tata Sons has been awaiting RBI’s decision on its application submitted in March 2024, and since no word from the regulator came before the Sept-end listing deadline, the deadline naturally expired.According to lawyers, there are two possibilities: either RBI accepts Tata Sons’ application with or without conditions or gives the company some more time to comply with its listing mandate.The central bank’s FAQs, however, highlight the structural challenge. While a CIC must keep 90% of its investments within the group, current norms cap group exposures for upper-layer NBFCs at 25-40% of capital. This makes a clean shift from NBFC-CIC difficult without breaching net owned funds, capital adequacy or concentration rules, since most of the business is tied up in subsidiaries.RBI says exemptions may be considered case by case if full details are furnished. Tata Sons is learned to be assuring RBI that once it surrenders its CIC licence, it will not engage in financial services that resemble banking or involve public funds. Such an undertaking could clear the way for de-registration and negate the need to list.",The Reserve Bank of India-mandated listing deadline for Tata Sons expired.

(AI image)

‘Not An Annual Fee’: White House Issues Clarification Amid Confusion Over H-1B Visa Fee Order

What is China’s K Visa?

So who qualifies for China's K visa?

International graduates holding bachelor's or higher degrees in STEM disciplines from prestigious universities or research centres globally or within the country (additional information about qualifying institutions forthcoming);

Young foreign professionals currently working in education and research roles within STEM-related domains.

And what are the benefits of K visa?

Length of residency: Offers enhanced flexibility regarding entry frequency and validity duration compared to standard visa categories currently available.

Permitted activities: Includes participation in educational, scientific, technological, cultural, entrepreneurial and commercial collaborative endeavours.

Entry criteria: Eliminates requirement for local company sponsorship, focusing instead on applicant's age, academic qualifications, or professional experience as determining factors.

Is China’s K visa the counter to Trump’s H-1B visa crackdown?

China K visa : The challenges

China’s K visa programme implementation faces several obstacles. The Chinese authorities have specified unclear requirements relating to ""age, educational background and work experience"".

The policy lacks transparency regarding monetary benefits, job placement support, long-term residency options and provisions for bringing family members.

China rarely grants citizenship to foreign nationals, unlike US immigration policies.

The predominant use of Mandarin in Chinese technology companies creates significant obstacles for professionals who don't speak the language.





China’s newly introduced K visa category, which is effective from October 1, 2025, is widely being seen as a counter (though not official!) to the Donald Trump administration’s crackdown on the H-1B visa programme. At a time when the US is imposing stricter immigration policies, China is clearly signalling an intent to ‘welcome’ global talent.The newly introduced K visa, announced in August, aims to attract young international STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) graduates by offering entry, residency and work authorization without requiring any prior work offer.Although China has abundant local engineering expertise, the K visa initiative forms part of Beijing's strategy to present itself as welcoming to international investment and skilled professionals, especially as US trade restrictions create uncertainty in China's economic landscape.The Trump administration recently hiked the H-1B visa application fee to $100,000, a move that sent shockwaves globally, and especially in the Indian IT sector which is a big beneficiary of this particular visa programme. The US is also looking to do away with the current H-1B visa lottery system, replacing it with a weighted system for visa allotment.In this backdrop, China’s K visa could potentially strengthen its position against the US in their geopolitical competition. What is China’s K visa, what are its application criteria, benefits, and challenges? We take a look:According to a KPMG analysis, China established the R visa for highly skilled professionals in 2013, but the introduction of the K visa specifically aims to attract foreign youth talent in science and technology fields.K visa holders will benefit from increased flexibility in managing their activities within China, facilitating broader scientific and technological cultural exchange programmes, says KPMG.China’s K visa could present an attractive option for overseas professionals seeking alternatives to US employment opportunities. Several countries, including South Korea, Germany and New Zealand, are implementing more accessible visa regulations to draw skilled migrants.Beijing has implemented various policies to encourage foreign investment and travel, including expanding access for international investors across multiple sectors and removing visa requirements for nationals from most European nations, Japan, South Korea and others.""The symbolism is powerful: while the US raises barriers, China is lowering them,"" notes Iowa-based immigration attorney Matt Mauntel-Medici according to a Reuters report.The Trump administration's recent announcement of a $100,000 annual fee requirement for H-1B worker visas, commonly utilised by technology firms for skilled foreign recruitment, has created new opportunities. ""The US has definitely shot itself in the foot on H-1Bs, and the timing is exquisite for China's K visa,"" noted Michael Feller, chief strategist at Geopolitical Strategy.Immigration specialists highlight that the K visa's primary advantage lies in eliminating the need for employer sponsorship, traditionally a significant obstacle for H-1B applicants.The H-1B programme's current structure requires company sponsorship and operates through a lottery system limited to 85,000 positions annually, with the newly proposed fee potentially discouraging first-time applicants.""It's an appealing alternative for Indian STEM professionals seeking flexible, streamlined visa options,"" Bikash Kali Das, an Indian student at Sichuan University told Reuters. Indians represented the largest group of H-1B recipients last year, comprising 71% of successful applicants.The diplomatic friction between India and China might restrict the intake of Indian professionals under the K visa programme, experts told Reuters.""China will need to ensure Indian citizens feel welcome and can do meaningful work without Mandarin,"" said Feller.China has historically concentrated its talent acquisition efforts on scientists of Chinese origin residing overseas and individuals of Chinese descent abroad.Substantial incentives, including housing allowances and welcome bonuses reaching 5 million yuan ($702,200), have successfully attracted Chinese STEM professionals from the United States, particularly as Washington intensifies its scrutiny of China-linked activities.""The recruitment effort targeting Indian tech talent in China is growing but remains moderate compared to the more intensive, well-established, and well-funded initiatives aimed at repatriating Chinese STEM talent,"" said Sichuan University's Das.A Chinese STEM graduate, who recently received employment offers from Silicon Valley, expressed doubts about the K visa programme's effectiveness.""Asian countries like China don't rely on immigration and local Chinese governments have many ways to attract domestic talent,"" he told Reuters.The United States hosts 51 million immigrants, comprising 15% of its population, whilst China accommodates merely 1 million foreigners, representing less than 1% of its residents.Whilst China is not expected to implement substantial changes to its immigration policies to accommodate millions of foreign workers, experts suggest the K visa could enhance Beijing's position in its technological competition with the US.""If China can attract even a sliver of global tech talent, it will be more competitive in cutting-edge technology,"" Feller said.","The newly introduced K visa, announced in August, aims to attract young international STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) graduates. It is widely being seen as a counter (though not official!) to the Donald Trump administration’s crackdown on the H-1B visa programme. The Chinese authorities have specified unclear requirements relating to ""age, educational background and work experience""","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124239728,imgsize-42242,width-400,resizemode-4/china-k-visa.jpg"
US economy tracker: Consumer confidence falls in September; inflation and weak job market weigh,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-economy-tracker-consumer-confidence-falls-in-september-inflation-and-weak-job-market-weigh/articleshow/124238464.cms,"



US consumer confidence fell sharply in September as Americans’ concerns over inflation and a weakening job market deepened, according to the Conference Board’s latest survey. The consumer confidence index dropped 3.6 points to 94.2, down from August’s 97.8, marking the lowest reading since April, when President Donald Trump implemented sweeping tariff policies.The index measuring Americans’ short-term expectations for income, business conditions, and employment fell to 73.4, well below the 80 threshold that often signals recession risks, AP reported. Meanwhile, consumers’ evaluation of current economic conditions declined by 7 points to 125.4. Survey respondents cited prices and inflation as their top concern about the economy, regaining the leading position, while mentions of tariffs declined slightly but remained elevated.Government data earlier this month showed inflation rising in August, driven by higher costs for gasoline, groceries, and airfares. Consumer prices increased 2.9% year-on-year, up from 2.7% in July, marking the largest rise since January.Core inflation, excluding food and energy, remained steady at 3.1%.Although unemployment and layoffs remain historically low, the labour market has shown signs of strain this year. The US added just 22,000 nonfarm jobs in August, following a disappointing 79,000 gain in July. Revisions to May and June trimmed a combined 258,000 jobs from prior estimates. The unemployment rate stands at 4.3%, the highest since October 2021.Job openings in August held steady at 7.2 million, according to the Labor Department. Economists note that the slowdown reflects not only the lingering effects of 11 Fed interest rate hikes in 2022 and 2023 but also the impact of Trump-era policies, including tariffs on imports, stricter immigration rules, and federal workforce reductions.Companies remain cautious in hiring, often adopting a “no hire, no fire” approach until the effects of tariffs become clearer. Analysts are now turning attention to Friday’s release of September jobs data, which is expected to show a modest 50,000 job gain.","The Conference Board's consumer confidence index dropped 3.6 points to 94.2, down from August’s 97.8.

US equities edged cautiously on Tuesday as Wall Street approached the end of another strong month, with investors balancing optimism over corporate earnings against economic uncertainty and the potential for a government shutdown.The S&P 500 slipped 0.2% in early trading, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 27 points, or 0.1%. The Nasdaq composite was down 0.2%, yet all three indexes remain positioned for a fifth consecutive monthly gain after last week’s record highs, AP reported.Energy stocks led declines as crude prices remained under pressure. Halliburton shares fell 2%, adding to the week’s losses in the oil sector. Technology gains provided some counterweight, with CoreWeave climbing 15.6% after confirming a $14.2 billion contract with Meta Platforms for cloud computing services under an existing agreement, highlighting continued strong demand for digital infrastructure.Investors are closely monitoring two key reports due later in the day. The first will provide a snapshot of US consumer confidence amid a slower job market and persistent inflation. The second, detailing job openings at the end of August, is expected to provide clues on labour market strength and its impact on the Federal Reserve’s policy trajectory. Analysts are hoping for balanced data—neither too strong to restrain rate cuts nor too weak to raise recession fears.The Fed delivered its first rate reduction of the year earlier this month and signalled more cuts may follow before year-end 2026. Policymakers aim to support the job market after months of steady rates, yet stronger-than-expected labour data could limit the central bank’s flexibility, while weaker readings could exacerbate recession concerns. Markets, already stretched by record valuations since April lows, remain sensitive to such developments.Adding to investor caution is the looming possibility of a US government shutdown. Political deadlock in Washington could halt funding at the end of the day, potentially delaying the release of key economic data, including Friday’s monthly jobs report. The Department of Labor has warned that the Bureau of Labor Statistics would cease operations entirely during a shutdown, raising concerns over data disruptions for market participants.On the corporate front, Vail Resorts slipped 4.6% after posting a larger quarterly loss than expected and signalling limited ski pass sales growth for the upcoming season. Lamb Weston, a major supplier of frozen potato products, jumped 6.3% after reporting better-than-expected quarterly profits, reflecting robust demand.Global markets were mixed, with European and Asian indices moving modestly as investors digested economic signals and geopolitical developments. In the bond market, the 10-year US Treasury yield eased to 4.12% from 4.15% late Monday, reflecting cautious sentiment amid ongoing uncertainty.","The S&P 500 slipped 0.2% in early trading, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 27 points, or 0.1%.

AGOA's impact on African economies



US-Africa trade relations



New partnerships, new opportunities for Africa







The trade agreement between the United States and sub-Saharan African nations, known as AGOA (African Growth and Opportunity Act), is set to expire on September 30.Though some are still hopeful for a last-ditch effort to clinch a follow-up agreement, dozens of African countries are preparing to see the end of 25 years of duty-free access to the US market, at least for now.""Studies show that AGOA has had positive effects. Exports to the US have increased, for example, in the textile industry,"" says Zoryana Olekseyuk, who researches the transformation of economic and social systems at the German Institute of Development and Sustainability (IDOS).""For example, Lesotho could lose almost 6% of total exports, Madagascar over 3%, Botswana and Chad around 2%,"" Olekseyuk told DW.She stressed, however, that all things considered, the success rate of AGOA is a bit of a mixed bag, highlighting that ""the overall effect for the region is limited and the impact varies from country to country and from sector to sector.""Launched in 2000 under US President Bill Clinton, the AGOA trade partnership was intended to bring Africa closer to the world's strongest economy.However, Donald Trump 's return to the White House in 2025, which brought renewed protectionist policies, saw tariffs go up once more, effectively undoing the deal.A total of 35 African countries were part of the agreement, which alleviated access to the American market. Almost 7,000 products could be transported across the Atlantic duty-free under the deal.The trade deal helped entire sectors to develop and flourish, textiles, agriculture and raw materials are some of the top industries that have benefited from the agreement over the years.This in turn resulted in massive job creation, particularly in Madagascar, Lesotho and South Africa.But now, a quarter century of achievements and growth might be lost overnight.Malick Sane, a specialist in international trade at Cheikh Anta Diop University in Dakar, told DW that African companies ""will have great difficulty in continuing to penetrate the American market with competitive products,"" leading to a decline in production output, and therefore jobs.South Africa, the largest African exporter to the United States, faces a projected loss of more than 35,000 jobs in the citrus fruit sector alone, while Madagascar will have to pay a 47% tax on vanilla and textile exports in the future.The US government, meanwhile threatened Lesotho, which relies heavily on the production of jeans materials, with a record tariff of 50%, which was reduced to 15% in July.Mauritius is to pay 40% on its industrial products. Some of these raw materials are essential for the American industry.US tariffs will also be levied on exports of platinum, gold, diamonds and rare earths, important sources of income for numerous countries such as South Africa, Ghana, Lesotho, Namibia and Madagascar.Africa's trade with the US had already been on the decline in recent years, emphasises economist Olekseyuk. ""In 2017, only 8.5% of exports from AGOA countries went to the US. That is significantly less than to Europe or China,"" she stressed, lending hope for a soft landing once the trade agreement expires.Furthermore, she adds that only a few African exporters have actually benefited from AGOA advantages, highlighting that profit margins ""are simply not big enough.""She adds that for the countries that were part of AGOA, the bureaucracy involved in trading with the US often was barely worth the efforts to begin with.In view of these ongoing economic developments, some countries may therefore not even wish to continue with AGOA, while others might seek their own direct deals with the US.Zimbabwe, for instance, decided to lift its own customs barriers to calm the situation, while South Africa and Madagascar continue to seek targeted exemptions from the US.Malian economist Etienne Fakaba Sissoko regards the end of AGOA as an opportunity for a new beginning, as other trading partners continue to gain importance across the continent.""The [Arican] countries should use this historic opportunity to free themselves from their dependency. For 25 years, AGOA has been presented as a gift. In reality, it has mainly served the geographical interests of the United States,"" he told DW.Fakaba Sissoko adds that the end of AGOA ""must be taken as an opportunity to move from a logic of aid to a logic of autonomy for our states.""""We need to build an African economic sovereignty that is no longer dependent on the whims of Washington or any other country.""Olekseyuk agrees, stressing that ""AGOA was important, but has lost its appeal.""""Its demise shows once again that Africa urgently needs to diversify its trade structures.""The African Union (AU) has long been pushing to advance the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA), which has been in force since 2021, to strengthen the continent's economic independence.The free trade area, which comprises 54 African countries with a population of around 1.5 billion people, could now become more attractive for companies across the continent than AGOA ever was, according to the trade expert Sane.However, another trend is emerging at the same time: African trade partnerships with other regions are also redefining the way that Africa's trade of tomorrow might look.China, which recently abolished its tariffs for 33 African countries, is particularly making a name for itself as a substitute partner.In 2024, African exports to the US under AGOA reached a value of $8 billion (€7.6 billion), nearly half of which was South African trade; the same year, trade between China and Africa grew by 4.8% to $295 billion, according to figures published by Chinese customs.Alongside China, the European Union will also remain an important partner for African economies via the Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA).Other countries such as India, Turkey, Brazil and Russia are also trying to strengthen their presence on the continent.For Mamady Kamara, a consultant for governance, development policy and entrepreneurship based in Washington DC, there is no question that Africa must further diversify its partnerships.However, Kamara also warns against replacing old dependencies with new ones: ""The challenge for Africa is to negotiate balanced agreements that actually promote local value creation,"" he told DW.","The AGOA trade agreement between the United States and sub-Saharan African nations is set to expire on September 30. Dozens of African countries are preparing to see the end of 25 years of duty-free access to the US market, at least for now.

US President Donald Trump continued his series of tariffs on Monday (local time), with the latest move impacting lumber and home renovation products from October 14.The White House said a 10% global tariff will be applied to softwood lumber imports.At the same time, upholstered furniture will face a 25% global tariff, rising to 30% on January 1, while kitchen cabinets and vanities will be hit hardest, with a 25% tariff climbing to 50% from the same time.Certain countries, including the United Kingdom, the European Union and Japan, will benefit from more favourable rates, reflecting the terms of their trade agreements with the US.The new tariffs have sparked criticism both inside and outside the United States, drawing complaints from small business owners and members of Congress.Legal challenges are ongoing, with the US Supreme Court set to hear arguments over the tariffs’ legality on November 5.In a fact sheet released alongside the announcement, the administration defended the measures as necessary for national security. It said, “Lumber plays a vital role in civilian construction and military infrastructure.”“Foreign supply chains and major exporters increasingly fill US demand, creating vulnerabilities to disruptions,” it further added, as cited by AFP.The fact sheet added that countries negotiating with the US “may be able to secure an alternative to the pending tariff increases.”","US President Donald Trump continued his series of tariffs on Monday.

The IMF on Tuesday began formal discussions with Pakistan’s economic officials to review the implementation of a $7 billion loan and a $1.1 billion Resilience and Sustainability Facility (RSF).The review comes as Pakistan’s performance under the programme up to June 2025 has been uneven, Dawn reported according to news agency PTI.Although the power sector targets for the end of June 2025 were achieved, revenue collection lagged by around Rs 1.2 trillion, nearly 1% of GDP, in the last fiscal year, with the first two months of the current year showing similar shortfalls.The IMF (International Monetary Fund) mission held its opening meeting on Monday with finance minister Muhammad Aurangzeb and a delegation that included the state bank governor, finance secretary, and federal board of revenue chairman.The delegation will be staying in Pakistan for nearly two weeks, during which they will review the progress of the $7 billion Extended Financing Facility (EFF) and the $1.1 billion RSF. Officials from both sides are expected to discuss corrective measures to meet the upcoming biannual targets, ending in December 2025.Pakistan is also seeking IMF support to accelerate the long-delayed brownfield petroleum refinery policy.The stalled upgrades have held back around $6 billion in fresh investment for upgrading refineries.Officials argue that the move is in line with the RSF’s goals, as the upgrades would allow production of petroleum products that meet European standards with lower carbon and sulphur emissions.The IMF mission will also hold forward-looking talks with authorities to push for faster implementation of the remaining targets, the report added.","IMF to review implementation of a $7 billion loan and a $1.1 billion Resilience and Sustainability Facility.

GSK leadership shuffle: Luke Miels named CEO after Emma Walmsley exits; US tariffs test British pharma sector,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/gsk-leadership-shuffle-luke-miels-named-ceo-after-emma-walmsley-exits-us-tariffs-test-british-pharma-sector/articleshow/124232077.cms,"Emma Walmsley (Photo credit- AP)





British drugmaker GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) on Monday (British time) announced that Emma Walmsley will step down as chief executive in January after nearly nine years at the helm, making way for chief commercial officer Luke Miels to take charge.The leadership transition comes at a critical juncture for the pharma giant, which is grappling with uncertainty over US President Donald Trump’s 100 per cent tariff on branded pharmaceutical imports. The tariff move, set to take effect this week, targets companies not investing in US-based manufacturing, AFP reported.Walmsley, 56, who steered GSK through the Covid-19 pandemic and spun off its consumer health division into Haleon in 2022, described 2026 as “a pivotal year for GSK to define its path for the decade ahead” and said she believed this was the right moment for new leadership. “Today, GSK is a biopharma innovator, with far stronger momentum and prospects than nine years ago,” she added.Miels, 50, who joined GSK after a senior stint at AstraZeneca, said he was “privileged to take on this responsibility, with humility and ambition,” and highlighted the company’s “outstanding prospects” as it navigates shifting global trade conditions.Shares in GSK gained 2.4 per cent in London morning trade following the announcement.Analysts said the rally reflected confidence in a smooth handover and expectations of stronger performance under Miels.Earlier this month, GSK unveiled plans to invest $30 billion in the United States over five years, including a biologics facility in Pennsylvania for cancer and respiratory drugs and artificial intelligence initiatives across its five American manufacturing sites.The investment was announced during Trump’s state visit to the UK and came before the White House unveiled sweeping tariffs on pharma imports. GSK and its British rival AstraZeneca are now hoping for exemptions, similar to those the EU expects to secure under its trade deal with Washington.Walmsley’s tenure was marked by intense scrutiny from activist investors, litigation costs—including a $2.3 billion payout to settle Zantac lawsuits without admission of liability—and pressure over Covid-19 vaccine delays. However, she also led a major turnaround, positioning GSK as a focused biopharma player.Her successor Miels will earn a base salary of £1.375 million ($1.85 million), below Walmsley’s level, but could receive additional bonuses, the company said.Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, noted that Walmsley had been “patiently leading a turnaround of the pharmaceutical giant almost ever since she took over in 2017,” pointing to progress on spin-offs and new drug pipelines despite setbacks in vaccines and legal overhangs.With Trump’s tariff threat looming, GSK’s change at the top signals not just a new era of leadership but also a crucial test for its global growth plans.",Emma Walmsley to step down as chief executive of GlaxoSmithKline in January.

US Gold Reserves





Gold prices have been reaching new lifetime highs and the value of gold reserves with countries is surging as well! The US Treasury's gold reserves have crossed $1 trillion in value, marking a significant milestone as gold prices hit new record highs above $3,824.50 per ounce on Monday, representing a 45% increase this year.The United States holds the world's largest gold reserves, which have seen remarkable appreciation amid various global factors.Gold’s record-breaking performance is driven by investors seeking safe-haven assets due to trade wars, geopolitical tensions, and concerns about potential US government funding issues.Additional factors contributing to gold's rally include increased investment in exchange-traded funds and the Federal Reserve's decision to resume interest rate cuts.According to a Bloomberg report, the value of $1 trillion is over 90 times higher than the government's official balance sheet figure of $11 billion. The official value remains fixed at the 1973 Congressional price of $42.22 per ounce, despite the substantial market price increase.Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent's casual remark earlier this year about marking the government's gold reserves to market value sparked discussions about a potential $990 billion windfall, though the idea was later dismissed and Bloomberg reported it wasn't under serious consideration.The United States maintains a unique system where gold is held directly by the government rather than the central bank. The Federal Reserve holds gold certificates matching the Treasury's holdings value and provides dollar credits to the government in return.A potential revaluation of gold reserves at current market prices would inject approximately $990 billion into the Treasury's accounts.This amount would address nearly half of the nation's budget deficit. ""That would cover about half of the $1.973 trillion total US budget gap for the fiscal year through August, a deficit level that was only surpassed in 2020 and 2021,"" a senior Treasury official stated when releasing the figures this month.While adjusting gold reserve valuations might seem appealing given debt-ceiling limitations, such a move would significantly impact the financial system by increasing liquidity and extending the Federal Reserve's balance-sheet reduction process.Several other nations have previously implemented similar gold revaluation measures. According to an August note from a Federal Reserve economist, Germany, Italy, and South Africa have all revalued their reserves in recent decades.",The value of $1 trillion is over 90 times higher than the government's official balance sheet figure of $11 billion. A potential revaluation of gold reserves at current market prices would inject approximately $990 billion into the Treasury's accounts.

India's GCCs: From back office to brain trust



Visa curbs, higher costs, shifting strategies



The risk of ‘extreme offshoring’



India's 'gold rush' moment







US President Donald Trump , with a business approach, raised H-1B application fees to an eye-watering $100,000 to protect Americans' jobs — but did it backfire?According to a report from Reuters, industry insiders warn that Trump's move may boomerang as many US companies are pushing to shift high-value work to India, where global capability centres (GCCs) are already booming.According to the Reuters report, India is a host to over 1,700 GCCs, more than half the global total. India is famous for its booming tech industry, but now it is also a centre for designing luxury car dashboards, power drug discovery, and driving financial innovation. Economists suggest that Trump's visa crackdown could turbocharge this trend.""GCCs are uniquely positioned for this moment,"" Rohan Lobo, Deloitte India's GCC industry leader, told Reuters. ""Plans are already underway"" as US firms rethink workforce needs, particularly those tied to sensitive federal contracts, he added.The economics now favour India after Trump's hike in H-1B visa costs — from $2,000–$5,000 to $100,000. Also, the renewed Senate moves to tighten visa rules have also sent shockwaves through US employers.""If these curbs hold, we'll see a flood of high-end work in AI, cybersecurity, and product development move into India's GCCs,"" said Lalit Ahuja, founder of ANSR, which has helped firms like FedEx, Target, Lowe's and Bristol-Myers Squibb build out their Indian hubs.""There is a sense of urgency.""According to Reuters, some experts predict ""extreme offshoring"" as firms accelerate what the COVID-19 pandemic already proved possible — running complex tech functions remotely. Among the top H-1B sponsors are major tech companies such as Amazon, Microsoft, Apple, and Google, as well as financial giants like JPMorgan Chase and retailers like Walmart. They all have sprawling Indian operations, though few are willing to comment due to the political sensitivity.As the projections remain bullish, India is expected to host more than 2,200 GCCs by 2030, with a market size nearing $100 billion. Trump's visa curbs, far from shielding US jobs, could end up fuelling India's rise as the world's nerve centre for corporate innovation.""This whole gold rush,"" Ahuja said, ""will only get accelerated.""","US President Donald Trump raised H-1B application fees to an eye-watering $100,000.

NEW DELHI: Days after the Trump administration imposed an exorbitant fee on H-1B visa , US commerce secretary Howard Lutnick said that there will be “a significant number of changes” in the H-1B visa process before February 2026, when the new fee of $100,000 goes into effect.Lutnick described the current visa process as a ""wrong idea"" which leads to “inexpensive” tech consultants coming into the country and bringing their families.“This procedure and process goes into effect in February of 2026, so my guess is going to be, there are going to be a significant number of changes between now and 2026,” Lutnick said in an interview with NewsNation.Lutnick said that with the USD 100,000 fee on applications, ""at least it shouldn't be overrun with these people. But I think you're going to see a real thoughtful change going forward. And that's what I expect will happen.""""There's going to be a variety of changes; they're talking about changes - how to get the lottery, should it still be a lottery? But that will all be resolved by February,” he said.He said that “but as of right now”, there's going to be a one-time fee of USD 100,000 to get in.“The idea of having tech consultants and trainees who are inexpensive should be eliminated.I have a strong opinion that way. I think the President's right with me on those same topics... I am completely on the view that this idea that inexpensive tech consultants should be coming into this country and bringing their families, I find it just wrong, and so it sits wrong with me,” Lutnick added.This comes after Trump issued a new presidential proclamation titled ""Restriction on Entry of Certain Nonimmigrant Workers"" that introduces a major overhaul to the H-1B visa programme, imposing a steep $100,000 fee on H-1B visa applications, raising fresh questions about whether this is a much-needed correction or a potentially crippling blow to America's tech talent pipeline.The fee increase represents a massive jump from the current $2,000–5,000 range, sparking concerns over its impact on startups, small businesses, and Indian IT professionals.Earlier, the government expressed serious concern over a raise in the H-1B visa fee, calling it a potential disruption for skilled Indian professionals and their families in the United States.In an official statement, the spokesperson said the full implications are being studied, noting that Indian industry has already put out an initial analysis clarifying some perceptions related to the H-1B program.“Industry in both India and the US has a stake in innovation and creativity and can be expected to consult on the best path forward,” the statement said.“Policymakers will therefore assess recent steps taking into account mutual benefits, which include strong people-to-people ties between the two countries,” the spokesperson added.","Lutnick described the current visa process as a ""wrong idea"" which leads to “inexpensive” tech consultants coming into the country and bringing their families. Lutnick said that with the USD 100,000 fee on applications, ""at least it shouldn't be overrun with these people. But I think you're going to see a real thoughtful change going forward""","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124230728,imgsize-1136603,width-400,resizemode-4/.jpg"
US government shutdown: Aviation sector to be hit! Airline workers may have to work without pay,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-government-shutdown-aviation-sector-to-be-hit-airline-workers-may-have-to-work-without-pay/articleshow/124224846.cms,"



The US aviation sector would be hit by the federal government's partial shutdown as key airline staff would be forced to work without pay while other functions would also come to a halt.Airlines for America, which represents major carriers including United, Delta, American and Southwest, said that a lapse in funding would impact travelers as ""the system may need to slow down, reducing efficiency.""“When federal employees who manage air traffic, inspect aircraft and secure our nation’s aviation system are furloughed or working without pay, the entire industry and millions of Americans feel the strain,” the group told Reuters.If the shutdown goes ahead, air traffic controllers and around 50,000 Transportation Security Administration (TSA) staff , like air traffic controllers and security officers, would have to continue working, but would receive no salaries.In 2019, a 35-day shutdown led to staff absences, long queues at airport checkpoints, and slowed flights in New York, forcing Congress to act quickly.Industry groups, unions, manufacturers and airports warned that a shutdown could force the FAA to halt hiring and training of air traffic controllers, postpone maintenance and safety checks, delay aircraft inspections, suspend pilot evaluations, and slow down modernisation programmes.A prolonged shutdown could also affect the FAA’s certification of Boeing’s 737 MAX 7 and stall a $12.5 billion air traffic control upgrade.The FAA’s shutdown plan from March stated that controller hiring and field training would be paused. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said on Friday he was concerned the shutdown could disrupt air traffic training and modernisation work.The National Air Traffic Controllers Association said hundreds of trainees at the FAA Academy in Oklahoma City could be furloughed, “causing significant delays in the training pipeline and worsen the ongoing air traffic controller staffing crisis. A government shutdown of any length could cause significant setbacks.”The FAA is currently around 3,800 controllers short of its target, with many staff working mandatory overtime and six-day weeks, contributing to flight delays and pressure on the system, Reuters reported.A government funding deal has yet to be reached. Congressional Democrats left a meeting with President Donald Trump on Monday without an agreement, raising the risk of a shutdown starting Wednesday.","US aviation sector would be hit by the federal government's partial shutdown.

Next gen Boeing planes! Airplane maker working on new designs; plans to replace 737 MAX,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/next-gen-boeing-planes-airplane-maker-working-on-new-designs-plans-to-replace-737-max/articleshow/124225461.cms,"



Aviation giant Boeing is reportedly in the early stages of designing a new single aisle jet that would eventually replace its 737 MAX.According to a report by the Wall Street Journal, sources familiar with the matter said that the company has been exploring engine options for the aircraft.Earlier this year, CEO Kelly Ortberg met with officials from Rolls-Royce Holdings (RR.L) in the UK to discuss a potential new engine. Boeing is also working on the flight deck design, though the project is still in its planning phase and no final decisions have been made.A spokesperson told the WSJ that Boeing’s recovery plan is progressing, focusing on delivering around 6,000 backlogged commercial aircraft and certifying previously announced models.The 737 MAX, which entered service in 2017, was grounded worldwide in 2019 after two crashes killed 346 people. The tragedies caused financial losses, legal challenges, and a criminal investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice. The FAA lifted the grounding order in 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic.Last Friday, the FAA authorised Boeing to issue airworthiness certificates for some 737 MAX jets, a power it lost in 2019 following the fatal crash in Ethiopia.Boeing continues to face strict regulatory oversight.Earlier this year, the FAA capped 737 MAX production at 38 planes per month after a mid-air cabin panel blew off an Alaska Airlines (ALK.N) jet, later found missing four bolts, according to Reuters.The incident prompted the US justice department to investigate and declared Boeing had failed to comply with a 2021 deferred prosecution agreement, originally imposed after the company misled regulators during the MAX’s certification process.","Boeing is reportedly in the early stages of designing a new single aisle jet that would eventually replace its 737 MAX.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground.Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change, too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain and boost vendor partnerships ahead of a stock market debut planned for 2025.The Series E round was done via a combination of fresh equity and conversion of debt, the Bangalore-based company said in a statement Thursday. The round was led by M&G Plc and existing investors including Lightspeed Venture Partners and DST Global participated.The round “fully funds our business plan,” Vaibhav Gupta, Udaan co-founder and chief executive officer, said in the statement. “It enables our continued journey of growth and profitability, positioning us well to be public-market ready in the next 12-18 months.”Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, runs an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business, though a very small part of India’s overall retail market, is expected to swell to $150 billion in sales in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co.The startup targets an initial public offering in 2025, though it’s yet to decide whether it will do so in India or overseas, Gupta told Bloomberg News last month.Udaan was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran the company until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021.

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Startups will play an important role in helping India become the third largest economy in the world, Chief Economic Advisor ( CEA ) to the Union government V Anantha Nageswaran has said.Nageswaran said that tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country due to improvements in infrastructure and supportive policies of the government, according to a KSUM release.The CEA, during his Leadership Talk on the concluding day of the Huddle Global 2023 organised by the Kerala Startup Mission (KSUM), said that India was the fifth largest economy on course to become the third largest in a few years.""In fact, I will say 7-in-7 is the buzz slogan, that is 7 trillion USD economy in seven years. Seven trillion USD economy size by 2030 is possible if India maintains its present growth trajectory, and in that journey startup entrepreneurs are going to play an important role,"" he is quoted as having said in the release.He was of the view that the active participation of startups in India in developing business models on the foundation of expanding physical and digital infrastructure will continue to generate efficiency, revenue and economic returns for the country.""The last decade has seen an exceptional transformation in the startup landscape in India, which has emerged as the third largest ecosystem globally, with over 1.12 lakh startups presently recognised by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) across 763 districts.""Among them, more than 110 are unicorns with a total valuation of around USD 350 billion,"" he said.The CEA further said that the country ranks second in innovation quality.He said that innovation in India was not just limited to certain sectors as startups were solving problems in 56 industrial sectors, with 13 per cent of them from IT services, nine per cent from health and life sciences, seven per cent from education, five per cent from agriculture and five per cent from food and beverages.Nageswaran also said it was significant that 49 per cent of the startups were from tier-2 and 3 cities which have turned to be game-changers as the business advantages in these locations enable entrepreneurs to operate at lower costs as compared to tier-1 cities.""Apart from improved infrastructure and the government's pro-active policies, the availability of a technically skilled talent pool is a huge advantage for startups to set up and flourish in tier-2 and tier-3 cities,"" he said.He said that historically there was a perception that small towns were difficult places to conduct business.""...but with improved internet penetration, vastly better physical infrastructure, road, rail and air connectivity and supportive government policies, this is no longer true,"" he said.He also noted Kerala's startup journey has been an inspiring one.The CEA said that KSUM has served as the catalyst since its establishment in 2006 to promote change that propelled the state into the forefront of the global startup arena.KSUM is the Kerala government's nodal agency established in 2006 for entrepreneurship development and incubation activities in the state.Nageswaran said that with over 4,000 registered tech startups, 63 incubators and 10 lakh square feet of incubation space, KSUM has not only met its goal of promoting technology-based entrepreneurship but has also earned the distinguished position of being among the world's top business incubators.The November 16-18 fifth edition of Huddle Global, India's biggest beachside startup conclave, was organised by KSUM at Adimalathura beach, near Vizhinjam, here.Attended by around 1,500 delegates, the event displayed sophisticated products from emerging sectors such as robotics, Artificial Intelligence , Machine Learning, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, life sciences, space tech, blockchain, IoT, e-governance, fintech, healthtech, agritech, edutech and SaaS from across the country.","Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran said tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country. CEA said that India was the fifth largest economy on course to become the third largest in a few years.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-105332515,imgsize-39018,width-400,resizemode-4/105332515.jpg"
E-Commerce startup Udaan to trim costs ahead of 2025 IPO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/e-commerce-startup-udaan-to-trim-costs-ahead-of-2025-ipo/articleshow/105001132.cms,"E-commerce startup Udaan is working to curb costs and forge new partnerships with consumer brands in India as it prepares to go public in 2025.Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta said in an interview. That’s set to happen around the same time as its initial public offering, he said.The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said. “Second, strategically we want to ensure that we are top of mind with shopkeepers, with big manufacturers, and we maintain our relative market share.”Lightspeed Venture Partners-backed Udaan is among startups trying to tap the rapid growth of India’s economy and consumer market, while meeting investor demands for profitability. Udaan, which at its peak employed thousands, joined fellow Indian startups in slashing jobs last year and tightening internal controls and compliance. It now has about 1,800 staff, and Gupta didn’t specify if further job cuts are needed.Corporate governance lapses at Indian online tutoring firm Byju’s, once the country’s top startup with a valuation of $22 billion, shone a light at unique challenges faced by founders in the South Asian nation and drove companies to be more diligent.“We continue to move towards more professionalized management, professionalized board and also institutionalized shareholders as we go towards public markets,” Gupta said.Udaan is yet to decide whether it will list in India or overseas. It was valued at more than $3 billion in a 2021 funding round, and was in talks to raise $400 million, Business Standard reported in September. Lightspeed owns about 35% of Udaan, while Tencent Holdings Ltd. holds 6%.The company was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran Udaan until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021. The other two founders — Amod Malviya and Sujeet Kumar — are board members.Udaan built an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business still accounts for a very small part of India’s overall retail market but can balloon to $150 billion in sales and yield a 100% return on capital invested in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co. estimates published in the Mint newspaper.Bengaluru-based Udaan has also ventured into financing through its fintech unit which helps shopkeepers get working capital loans to buy inventory. That business is profitable before taxes and is growing 70% annually, Gupta said.“That’s a second business in the overall umbrella of Udaan trying to organize trade in the country,” Gupta said. “In addition to commerce, financing becomes an important market opportunity.”","Udaan will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta says.

How India's GDP has been growing

What SBI report said on savings and investment

Incremental capital output ratio

NEW DELHI: India's gross domestic product (GDP) data for the third quarter (October-December 2022) received a word of caution from the former Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Raghuram Rajan In an interview with news agency PTI, Rajan that India is ""dangerously close"" to the Hindu rate of growth in view of subdued private sector investment, high interest rates and slowing global growth.India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%.Rajan termed this sequential slowdown in growth as ""worrying"".However, a report released by the State Bank of India (SBI) economists on Tuesday dismissed arguments that India is dangerously close to Hindu rate of growth saying such statements are ""ill-conceived, biased and premature"".The term 'Hindu growth rate' was coined by late economist Raj Krishna in 1978 to describe the slow growth in the country.It basically refers to the low pace of economic growth rates during 1950s to 1980s. During this period, the Indian economy averaged 3.5%.A former lecturer at the Delhi School of Economics (DSE), Krishna noted that only if the rate of growth is persistently slow and accompanied by low per-capita GDP, then it will be known as Hindu rate of growth but it has to factor in population growth as well.Before economic reforms of 1991, India's economic growth remained stagnant and low, while per capita income averaged around 1.3%. Krishna termed this low growth situation to be a result of socialist policies of state control and import substitution.However, the economic situation changed when liberalisation, privatisation and globalisation (LPG) reforms came into effect in the year 1991, at a time when India faced balance of payment crisis.Over the years, many economists have strongly opposed the idea of 'Hindu growth rate' and the term never had universal acceptance.The Indian economy plunged into its very first technical recession in FY21 due to the impact of Covid-19 pandemic and the related nationwide lockdowns. GDP shrunk by an unprecedented 23.8% in the first quarter of the financial year 2020-21. However, due to spurt in economic activities in the subsequent quarters, the GDP decline started to narrow.However, if we look at the period before Covid-19 as well, India's growth curve shows a declining trend.From 8.26% in FY17, GDP growth plunged to 3.74% in FY20. Shutdown of economic activities in FY21 in wake of Covid-19 only made matters worse.As lockdowns started to ease and business activities resumed, India's GDP also started rising. In Q1 of FY22, growth jumped to 20.1% mainly on account of low base effect. By the fourth quarter of FY22, growth came down to 4.10%.Similarly, the new financial year 2022-23 brought fresh economic challenges in the form of Russia-Ukraine war that impacted almost all major economies of the world, slowed the pace of growth, pushed inflation to record highs.As a result, the central banks of all advanced economies spurred into action and opted for monetary policy tightening to curb the soaring inflation.With persistently rising interest rates, India's economy grew by 4.4% in Q3 of FY23, as the Centre revised upwards GDP growth for previous year to 9.10% from 8.7% earlier.The report weighed recent GDP numbers against the available data on savings and investments for the past decade and highlighted some interesting points.""Quarterly growth numbers are noisy and should be best avoided for any serious interpretation (on an average, India's GDP growth has witnessed Rs 2 lakh crore upward revision for the 3 year ended FY23),"" the report said.Gross capital formation (GCF) by the government touched a high of 11.8% in 2021-22, up from 10.7% in 2020-21.""This also had a domino effect on private sector investment that jumped from 10 per cent to 10.8% over the same period,"" it said.In fact, Ecowrap added that the trends in GCF to gross output ratio or the plough back of funds for creation of fresh capacity shows that for public administration the ratio attained fresh peak in 2021-22 owing to the emphasis on capital expenditure in recent budgets.At the aggregate level, gross capital formation is supposed to have crossed 32% in 2022-23, the highest level since 2018-19.According to the report, in 2021-22, gross savings have risen to 30% from 29% in 2020-21.""The ratio is supposed to have crossed 31 per cent in 2022-23, the highest since 2018-19. The household savings increased sharply during the pandemic period on account of sharp accretion in financial savings such as deposits,"" said the report by SBI's Economic Research Department.While household financial savings have since then moderated from 15.4% in 2020-21 to 11.1% in 2022-23, savings in physical assets have grown sharply to 11.8% in 2021-22 from 10.7% in 2020-21.The report further analysed Incremental Capital Output ratio (ICOR) -- which measures additional units of capital (investment) needed to produce additional units of output. It said that the ratio has been improving.""ICOR which was 7.5 in FY 12 is now only 3.5 in FY22. Clearly, only half of capital is now needed for next unit of output,"" the report noted.Such reducing ICOR in the current years reflects a relatively increasing efficiency of capital and shows that the economy is on a sound footing, the report said.""From that point of view, future GDP growth rates even at 7% could still mean a decent number by any standards!,"" it added.","India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%.

An employee is entitled for a 50 per cent amount of the last drawn salary as pension.OPS was discontinued by the NDA government in 2003 with effect from April 1, 2004.Under the new pension scheme (NPS), employees contribute 10 per cent of their basic salary towards pension while the government contributes 14 per cent.Governments of Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand have informed the central government/ Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA about their decision to restart OPS for their employees.The government of Punjab on November 18, 2022, issued a notification regarding implementation of OPS for the state government employees who are being covered under NPS. Jharkhand too has decided to revert to OPS.",Former RBI governor Raghuram Rajan has expressed his concern over the decision of some states to restart the old pension scheme.

The meeting was chaired by Food Secretary Sanjeev Chopra.Out of the total wheat procurement target for the 2022-23 marketing year (April-March), Punjab will aim to procure 2.5 million tonnes wheat, Haryana 1.5 million tonnes and Madhya Pradrsh 2 million tonnes, the food ministry said in a statement.Wheat procurement had declined last year due to a fall in domestic production and higher exports.However, the government has projected a record wheat production at 112.18 million tonnes in the 2023-24 crop year (July-June) as per the second estimate of the agriculture ministry.Besides wheat, the government has also fixed rabi (winter) rice procurement target at 10.6 million tonnes in the 2022-23 marketing year.States have been advised to enhance rice milling capacity so that milling of one season gets completed before the commencement of next season and recycling of rice may be avoided.Whereas procurement of millets and coarse grains is estimated to be 7,50,000 tonnes this year, higher than 6,30,000 tonnes in 2021-22.

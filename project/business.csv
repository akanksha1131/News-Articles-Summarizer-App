India’s growth fundamentals ‘very strong’! RBI governor Sanjay Malhotra dismisses worries on Trump tariffs; ‘not a matter of huge concern’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/indias-growth-fundamentals-very-strong-rbi-governor-sanjay-malhotra-dismisses-worries-on-trump-tariffs-not-a-matter-of-huge-concern/articleshow/124582940.cms,"Malhotra affirmed on Wednesday that Indian markets possess significant depth, whilst highlighting the country's robust macroeconomic fundamentals.

India’s economic story is strong, and with a largely domestically driven economy, the impact of US tariffs is not a matter of huge concern, believes RBI governor Sanjay Malhotra. The Donald Trump administration has imposed 50% tariffs on India, 25% of which are for the latter’s crude oil trade with Russia.During the IMF annual meetings, the central bank governor noted that India's economy remains primarily domestically oriented, and whilst tariffs have an impact, they do not present substantial concerns.Malhotra affirmed on Wednesday that Indian markets possess significant depth, whilst highlighting the country's robust macroeconomic fundamentals.He said that positive indicators point towards ""capacity utilisation is increasing.""Regarding global uncertainties, Malhotra said, ""We are living in times of unprecedented uncertainties on account of various reasons, including policy uncertainties."" He highlighted the challenges these conditions pose for emerging market growth, adding, ""It is a risk that all EM economies must take into account.""Addressing inflation and global disruptions, the RBI governor observed that despite elevated levels, inflation has shown considerable reduction from 2022 peaks.Regarding price levels and GDP growth, the RBI chief discussed India's resilience against international disruptions, stating, ""India bounced back from Covid, the implications of Russia-Ukraine war; we have managed our inflation very well—from 8% to now 1.5%—the lowest in 8 years."" He acknowledged that food prices dominate India's CPI basket, creating specific challenges for the fiscal committee.The governor emphasised India's robust economic performance, noting growth forecasts exceeding 8 percent throughout the previous year. The fiscal deficit remains controllable at 4.4 percent of GDP for the Centre, whilst total debt stays amongst the world's lowest. He attributed these achievements to effective collaboration between the government and fiscal committee.""On an average in the last four years, we have got an eight plus percent growth rate. The first quarter was 7.8%. So I would say, a coordinated effort with the fiscal authorities identifying pressure points, both on the demand side and supply side, and this coordinated action really helped us.""Addressing currency dynamics, he indicated that despite the dollar's 10 percent decline, the Indian rupee showed limited appreciation compared to other currencies, attributing this to increased tariffs and capital outflows. He stressed the importance of maintaining stable rupee movements.The governor observed that worldwide economic growth remains weak, with nations adopting increasingly protectionist stances. Various elements, including export prospects and tariff structures, will determine currency and domestic economic outcomes. He noted that both households and enterprises currently exhibit hesitancy in spending and investment decisions, indicating wariness during uncertain times.","RBI governor Sanjay Malhotra affirmed on Wednesday that Indian markets possess significant depth, whilst highlighting the country's robust macroeconomic fundamentals.

Top stock market recommendations:After 2 days in red, Nifty is back in green covering up losses of the past 2 days – closing at 4 week highs. Current leg opens for a short term upside to 25450 with a buy on dip near 25250 now getting opened.

Target opening to near the 800 mark soon.Voltas has been forming an inverted head and shoulder pattern on weekly charts from February 2025. While on hourly and daily charts the stock has just broken out from a bullish flag formation citing early signs of interlocking breakout, potential crossing higher than the IH&S neckline. Adding to this, sustaining above its 200DMA is also allowing short covering to be developed on the counter.For Torrent Power stock, a 6 month sloping trendline breakout is seen as a follow up move after the original corrective trendline was taken out last month which was holding its place since October 2024. Reversal from its previous support of March 2025 lows and this double trendline breakout confirms that the forward short term trend has now shifted on the upside to retest its 200 DMA near the 1380 / 1390 mark.","According to Aakash K Hindocha, Deputy Vice President - WM Research, Nuvama Professional Clients Group, the top buy calls for today are: Bikaji, Voltas, and Torrent Power.

Galeries Lafayette sets foot in India with Mumbai store,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/galeries-lafayette-sets-foot-in-india-with-mumbai-store/articleshow/124592804.cms,"



MUMBAI: Parisian luxury department store Galeries Lafayette is tapping India for growth, a market it said lacks luxury retail avenues for high spending consumers who shop for a spate of labels across pricey fashion houses and shopping stores abroad.The retailer’s flagship store in Paris’s Boulevard Haussmann is the second most-visited tourist spot in the French capital after Eiffel Tower and attracts 35 million visitors a year, half of which are foreigners.Galeries Lafayette, which is launching in India through partnership with the Aditya Birla Group, will open its first store in Mumbai early next month, after eight years of studying the local market and consumer nuances.“India is a key and strategic country. It also has great opportunities in terms of growth. Indian consumers are already very interested in buying luxury brands and products. They consume them not only in India but also abroad — Dubai, Singapore, the UK, Paris and especially in Galeries Lafayette. Clearly, there is a lack of offer inside India...there are no (luxury) department stores here,” Galeries Lafayette CEO Arthur Lemoine, told TOI in an interview here.The India foray, announced three years back, comes at a time when US tariff turmoil has clouded global growth prospects, nudging companies to review strategies.Of the 67 Galeries Lafayette stores globally, 58 are in home market France with the rest of the nine outlets spread across Asia including China, Indonesia and Dubai.The luxury brand has stitched a 20-year licensing agreement with the Aditya Birla Group. “Beyond the year which are written in the contract, we are here to build the future together,” said Lemoine. The four-storey department store in south Mumbai will house a broad range of global products — from bags to beauty, apparel and accessories. From a Rs 25-lakh bag to a Rs 3,000 lipstick, the idea is to cater to the luxury consumers but also tapping into the premium cohort who are willing to upgrade to high-end brands.“Luxury in our country today stands at the threshold of transformation,” said Aditya Birla Group chairman Kumar Mangalam Birla, adding that “In the span of less than a decade, the market is set to grow over four-fold from $20 billion to almost $90 billion by 2030.”The brand play will be omni-channel to give access to a wider set of affluent consumers, many of whom are sitting in non-metros. “In India, we have pockets of consumption all across the country,” said R Sathyajit, CEO, international brands at Aditya Birla Fashion & Retail adding that the company’s own website will be launched in a couple of months.Delhi will house the next Galeries Lafayette store. Currently, the assortment at the store is global with a tilt towards French and Parisian brands. “Over a period of time, we would also like to be a platform for emerging designers in India as well. The beauty of a department store is that it evolves with time, reflecting changing generations, tastes,” Sathyajit said.",Galeries Lafayette is launching in India through partnership with the Aditya Birla Group.

‘Old’ is gold this wedding season,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/old-is-gold-this-wedding-season/articleshow/124592778.cms,".





MUMBAI: With gold prices hitting through the roof, Indians are making more with less this big, fat wedding season. For one, many consumers are exchanging old gold, which somewhat helps ease the burden of steep prices of the yellow metal, synonymous with desi shaadis. “Many consumers are exchanging old gold to offset higher prices, while others are planning purchases in stages to manage costs effectively,” said Joy Alukkas, chairman & managing director at Joyalukkas Group. The extent to which consumers can save up on costs through exchange programme depends on a host of factors such as purity, weight and the current value of their old gold. Many wedding shoppers are choosing to bring in their old pieces and exchange them for new, upgraded designs with enhanced purity, said Joita Sen, director, head of marketing and designs at Senco Gold & Diamonds, which is currently offering 100% value on old gold exchange.Investors are flocking to safe haven gold amid geopolitical tensions, taking its prices close to Rs 1.3 lakh mark/10 grams level in the local spot market earlier this week. Tata’s Tanishq has seen a great response to its exchange initiative. “We have been giving a sweetener saying no matter what karatage, we will not make any deductions,” said Ajoy Chawla, CEO, jewellery division at Titan. Wedding spends in India stand at an estimated $130 billion annually and jewellery makes up for the largest share of the spends—at $35-$40 billion, a report by Jefferies last year had showed.“There is also a growing interest in designs that offer a heavier look through intricate craftsmanship and volumetric detailing but with lower grammage,” said Ramesh Kalyanaraman, executive director at Kalyan Jewellers. In fact, many brides today are ditching traditional gold and diamond pieces for more contemporary designs; this trend is partly also driven by high prices.The second half of the wedding season in India begins in November and stretches through Feb.","With gold prices hitting through the roof, Indians are making more with less this big, fat wedding season.

Gold and silver price prediction today:MCX Gold prices are currently trading around the ₹1,27,000 mark, reflecting strong bullish momentum. On the international front, COMEX gold is comfortably holding above the $4,000 level, further reinforcing the positive trend. This price behaviour indicates that gold is consistently forming higher lows, which is a classic sign of strength in technical analysis. The ability to protect previous support levels suggests that buyers are active at lower levels, absorbing selling pressure and preparing for potential upside moves.From a short-term trading perspective, gold prices have the potential to move towards the ₹1,30,000 level if the current momentum continues. Traders can consider accumulating positions near the ₹1,26,000 support zone, where buying interest has previously emerged. A strong support base is seen at ₹1,23,500, and any dip toward this level may offer a good risk-reward entry for bullish positions.Given the ongoing geopolitical tensions, inflationary concerns, and a weak global economic outlook, gold remains a preferred safe-haven asset.These factors are likely to keep demand strong and prices buoyant in the near term. As long as prices sustain above the key support levels, the outlook for gold remains optimistic with further upside potential.MCX Silver has shown significant strength and has outperformed MCX Gold in recent sessions, currently trading around ₹1,60,000 levels. This rally reflects robust bullish sentiment driven by a combination of industrial demand, investment interest, and a positive technical setup. Silver's strong price action suggests that market participants are confident in its upside potential, especially as it continues to make higher highs and higher lows, a clear sign of an ongoing uptrend.Compared to gold, silver tends to exhibit more volatility, which can offer attractive trading opportunities. Any corrective move or dip toward the ₹1,57,000 level can be seen as a buying opportunity, supported by strong demand and momentum. On the upside, prices have the potential to move toward ₹1,63,000 in the near term. Traders should maintain a stop-loss at ₹1,54,000 to manage risk effectively in case of unexpected price reversals.Silver's dual role as both a precious and industrial metal makes it a favored asset in times of economic uncertainty, as well as during periods of industrial recovery. With favorable fundamentals and technical strength, silver remains well-positioned for further gains, and buying on dips strategy could prove rewarding in the current market environment.","Both gold and silver prices are exhibiting strong bullish momentum.

Sanctions hit ‘shadow fleet,’ oil terminals, and Indian refiner



EU sanctions



Focus on Rosneft, Lukoil — the Kremlin’s biggest earners







The United Kingdom on Wednesday announced 90 new sanctions targeting Russia's oil sector and Indian petroleum firm Nayara Energy Limited, in a fresh bid to cut off Moscow's wartime revenue streams.The UK's foreign, commonwealth and development office (FCDO) said the coordinated action, taken jointly with the Treasury, was designed to “strike at the heart” of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s war funding machine.“Today’s action demonstrates the government’s determination to cut off Putin’s revenue streams – targeting Russian companies and their global enablers,” the FCDO said in a statement.The sanctions package targets four oil terminals in China, 44 tankers in what the UK described as a “shadow fleet” used to transport Russian crude, and Nayara Energy Limited, which the FCDO claimed had imported 100 million barrels of Russian oil worth over USD 5 billion in 2024 alone.London said the move is intended to “take Russian oil off the market” and choke off the flow of energy revenues feeding Putin’s “war chest” amid the ongoing conflict with Ukraine.Nayara Energy earlier had been hit by European Union (EU) sanctions.“Nayara Energy operates in full compliance with the laws and regulations of India. As an Indian company, we are deeply committed to supporting the nation’s energy security and fostering economic growth,” Nayara Energy had said.“Recently, Nayara Energy has come under international scrutiny, facing political pressures and the imposition of sanctions by the European Union which have no legal basis. We categorically state that this unilateral move by the European Union is founded on baseless assertions, representing an undue extension of authority that ignores both international law and the sovereignty of India,” it added.The UK said the new measures also directly target Russia’s energy behemoths Rosneft and Lukoil — two of the world’s largest oil exporters, together shipping about 3.1 million barrels a day.Rosneft alone, the FCDO noted, accounts for nearly half of Russia’s oil production and roughly six per cent of global supply.",UK announces 90 new sanctions targeting Russia's oil sector and Indian petroleum firm Nayara Energy Limited.

New Delhi: India’s exports to the US fell nearly 12% to $5.5 billion in Sept, the first full month since 50% tariffs were imposed by US President Donald Trump on all shipments from Aug 27.But overall exports held steady, rising 6.7% to $36.4 billion in Sept, while imports jumped 16.7% to a record $68.53 billion — a shade higher than Aug 2024 level of $68.51 billion. As a result, trade deficit ballooned to $32.1 billion, a 13-month high.Imports rose as fertilizer shipments surged three times to $21 billion, while gold and silver more than doubled on soaring international prices. Gold imports rose to $9.6 billion in Sept from $4.6 billion in same month last year, while silver jumped to $1.3 billion.Commerce secretary Rajesh Agrawal told reporters that Indian goods and services exports were doing well, despite the global turbulence as the domestic industry remained resilient. “They are maintaining their supply chains and business relations,” he told reporters here.Asked about the impact of US tariffs on India’s exports, Agrawal, who is also the chief negotiator for the proposed trade deal — said the department was looking at commodity-wise data to assess the impact, while maintaining that 45% of India’s exports to the US remained outside the ambit of high tariffs, which included sectors such as pharma and electronics.Electronics exports picked up further during Sept, rising over 50% to $3.1 billion. Petroleum products too fared well, growing 15% to just under $5 billion, while engineering exports went up 2.9% to $10.1 billion. The bad news was that services exports fell 5.5% to $30.8 billion in Sept, while imports were down 7.3% to $15.3 billion. “With well-targeted export promotion strategies and market diversification efforts, India can deepen its global footprint and reduce over-dependence on a few markets,” Fieo’s S C Ralhan said.","India’s exports to the US fell nearly 12% to $5.5 billion in Sept. It was the first full month since 50% tariffs were imposed by US President Donald Trump on all shipments from Aug 27. But overall exports held steady at $36.4 billion, while imports jumped 16.7% to a record $68.53 billion.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124592683,imgsize-19644,width-400,resizemode-4/screenshot-2025-10-16-052538.jpg"

What are your plans for the Indian market, especially as competition is becoming stiffer here as companies transition towards EVs and sustainable vehicles?

What are the factors in India that make it such a promising market for carmakers?

As SUVs are the dominant body style now, will you still focus on small cars here? They once used to rule the market.

How do you see competition from Maruti, Mahindra and Tata Motors?

Chinese carmakers have been growing across the world. How do you see the threats here?

You have announced plans to launch your Genesis luxury brand in India.

Can you give details?

You have a 20-40% dividend payout plan even while looking at massive capex. How do you do this?





Jose Munoz, who became the first non-Korean to be appointed as the global CEO and president of Hyundai in Jan 2025, has his eyes firmly fixed on India — a market that he sees not just as high potential for the company’s global operations but also as a territory he believes will make the company globally competitive. A native of Spain and a US citizen, Munoz (60) is upfront on India’s importance. Excerpts from a Q&A:We have strong plans for India, which includes investing Rs 45,000 crore by fiscal 2030, launching 26 new cars that will include seven new nameplates, eight hybrids and five EVs. We are targeting a 1.5X growth in our revenues which we expect to cross Rs 1 lakh crore by FY30 with sustained double-digit ebitda (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation) margins and a dividend payout guidance of 20-40%. We expect the Indian market to have total industry volumes of 5.6 million vehicles by 2030, and intend to make the country a hub for exports, including for electrics. I think India is not just important for Hyundai’s global strategy, but India is Hyundai’s global strategy.Get the message loud and clear. But we also realise that while plans are very important, they are just 1% of the strategy. Most important part is execution which is 99%.When we look at India, we feel immense potential in the large number of people who use motorcycles and 3-wheelers. They all have aspirations of owning a car. I see two Indias — one which is like global markets with SUVs and off-roaders. The other has a massive market potential where current usage is of 3-wheelers and motorcycles which will move to passenger cars. The market is becoming more and more important for us… Given the population and the expected motorisation, it will be like a rocket. By FY30-end, we see India emerge as our biggest region for volumes after North America.We are not going to abandon the (small car) market which makes us more competitive and allows us to be popular. Small cars help our customers with an easy transition from entry cars to our bigger ones.We see a very huge evolution here. The local brands have great design and have improved in quality and reliability. I am impressed by the latest SUVs and road capabilities of the brands. We welcome competition. We are better when we are challenged. While our plan is complete and very challenging with a lot of ingredients, we need to be very serious about strong contenders in India. We not only see this as a market, but as a way for us to become globally competitive.The Indian market is itself becoming extremely competitive. If we are able to succeed here, we will be in a better position to compete against the Chinese.Genesis will enter India in 2027. We plan to locally manufacture the models in the country. We see good potential for the luxury brand here.That’s part of the plan. We are not a short-term oriented company. It’s a mid- to long-term plan. You need to be well balanced — to invest and also provide a dividend.","Jose Munoz, who became the first non-Korean to be appointed as the global CEO and president of Hyundai in Jan 2025, has his eyes firmly fixed on India.

MUMBAI: Two academics on the RBI’s monetary policy committee — Nagesh Kumar and Ram Singh — called for shifting the policy stance to accommodative, citing subdued inflation and the need to support growth but governor Sanjay Malhotra said such a move would amount to giving “definitive forward guidance” on the next step, which he felt was inappropriate given global uncertainty.The minutes of the Sept 29–Oct 1 MPC meeting released by RBI on Wednesday showed that most members felt that a rate cut at this point would be a “waste of ammunition”. “Growth remains below our aspirations,” Malhotra said. “The benign outlook for headline and core inflation as a result of the downward revision of projections opens up policy space to further support growth. Even though there is policy space to further cut the policy rate, I feel this is not the opportune time for the same as it will not have the desirable impact,” Malhotra added.The MPC unanimously voted to keep the repo rate unchanged at 5.5% and retained its neutral stance. Kumar said the “external context has changed dramatically” since the Aug meeting. “Before we could absorb the 25+25% reciprocal and penal tariffs on goods that became effective from the end of Aug, a hefty $100,000 fee was imposed on H1B visas,” he said. High penal tariffs imposed by the US on India have the prospect of affecting MSMEs and jobs in a significant manner, he said.While inflation at 2.6% has created “policy space for monetary action”, Kumar said it was better to wait until Dec before deciding on a rate cut. “Nevertheless, we may like to signal readiness by changing the stance from ‘neutral’ to ‘accommodative’,” he added.",Two academics on the RBI’s monetary policy committee — Nagesh Kumar and Ram Singh — called for shifting the policy stance to accommodative.

Residents in several parts of the UAE are being advised to brace for rainy weather, lower temperatures, and dusty winds between Friday, October 10, and Tuesday, October 14, as a shifting weather system moves through the region, primarily affecting the northern and eastern areas.The National Centre of Meteorology (NCM) has forecast a period of unstable weather conditions starting Friday, October 10, through Tuesday, October 14, due to the influence of an extended surface low-pressure system from the south and an upper-level low carrying relatively cold and humid air. These upper-level low-pressure systems tend to intensify with altitude and are typically linked with cloud development and rainfall.During this five-day stretch, weather models indicate that areas most likely to experience rain include Ras Al Khaimah, Fujairah, and Al Ain, while major coastal cities like Dubai and Abu Dhabi are expected to remain largely dry. The Windy app projects the rain will begin on Sunday. Forecasts describe the expected rainfall as light to moderate overall, with some areas experiencing heavy rain intermittently. This weather activity is expected to affect primarily the northern and eastern regions, with the potential to extend inland and toward some western areas.There is also a limited chance of hailstones forming in certain locations.In addition to rain, a noticeable drop in temperatures is expected across several affected regions. Windy conditions may intensify at times, potentially kicking up dust and sand. These conditions may reduce visibility in some areas and could affect outdoor plans, especially during the weekend. Sea conditions are also likely to be impacted, with wave activity in both the Arabian Gulf and the Oman Sea ranging from slight to moderate, occasionally becoming rough.September and October are typically among the most humid months of the year in the UAE, with humidity sometimes reaching 100 percent. However, this year has seen relatively drier conditions leading up to this weather shift. With forecasts predicting a cooler, wetter period, residents and travelers are advised to monitor updates and plan accordingly.","From October 10-14, Ras Al Khaimah, Fujairah, and Al Ain are expected to experience light to moderate rain and dust.

Sfeer Loyalty Program: A community-centric approach

Hafawa Lounge: Riyadh Air’s first premium ground experience

Strategic significance: Vision 2030 and the aviation push









Saudi Arabia’s newest national airline, Riyadh Air, is preparing for a strategic soft launch of its first international route — daily flights between Riyadh and London Heathrow — beginning October 26, 2025. While tickets won’t be publicly available yet, this tightly managed rollout marks a crucial proving phase as the airline gears up for full-scale commercial operations in 2026.Backed by the Public Investment Fund (PIF), Riyadh Air is positioning itself as a future global aviation leader, with this initial route serving not only as a testbed for systems, aircraft, and service procedures, but also as a key milestone in the Kingdom’s broader Vision 2030 strategy.Riyadh Air’s first operational route will connect King Khalid International Airport in Riyadh with London Heathrow Airport, one of the world’s busiest and most tightly controlled hubs. But these initial flights won’t be open for general ticket sales. Instead, the seats will be available exclusively to Riyadh Air employees, staff at the airline’s owner — Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund (PIF) — and their families.The reason for this controlled opening is strategic. While the airline secured a pair of coveted Heathrow slots back in June for the Northern Hemisphere winter season, it does not yet have its own aircraft. Riyadh Air’s order with Boeing for 72 Dreamliners — 39 firm orders for the 787-9 model and 33 options — originally targeted first deliveries by December 2024. That schedule has now been pushed back due to production delays, with the first jets now expected in late 2025.To avoid losing the Heathrow slots under the airport’s strict “use it or lose it” rules, Riyadh Air is launching the route using a leased Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner from Oman Air. The aircraft, named Jamila and registered as HZ-RXX, is currently being used for pilot training, certification flights, and operational trials.Passengers on these early flights will be considered “Launch Members” and will be invited to share detailed feedback on every part of the journey — from booking and boarding to in-flight experience and ground handling. Tickets for these flights will only be available through the airline’s newly unveiled loyalty platform, Sfeer.Speaking at the official announcement, Riyadh Air CEO Tony Douglas made it clear that this staged approach is a deliberate choice, not a compromise.“If you go big bang on day one and assume everything will work perfectly on the first day, well, the reality is it won’t,” he said. “So we will use that short period to trial everything and make sure the feedback gives us the opportunity to polish every last little detail before I actually sell a ticket to you.”The new Riyadh–London route spans 3,070 miles with a flight time of approximately 7 hours, making Riyadh Air the fourth airline to operate on this corridor.While Saudia currently maintains a strong presence on the route, it is gradually withdrawing from Riyadh-based services to make way for Riyadh Air, which will become the Kingdom's flagship international airline.Though Riyadh Air is just beginning operations, its long-term ambitions are substantial. The airline was officially announced in March 2023 by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and is a cornerstone of the Kingdom’s Vision 2030, an economic diversification plan that seeks to position Riyadh as a global business and tourism hub.Riyadh Air plans to serve over 100 destinations worldwide by 2030, supported by a modern, fuel-efficient fleet and a focus on premium service across every touchpoint. The scale of its ambition is reflected in its extensive aircraft order book:Riyadh Air’s expansion plans are backed by a massive and diversified aircraft order portfolio:This strategic mix aims to equip the airline with a modern, fuel-efficient fleet for both regional and long-haul destinations.Following the launch of its first route to London, Riyadh Air’s next confirmed destination will be Dubai International Airport. The Riyadh–Dubai corridor is among the busiest in the region, with more than 30 daily flights at peak times, operated by a mix of low-cost and full-service carriers. This route will also mark Riyadh Air’s first direct competition with Emirates, which currently operates three daily Boeing 777-300ER services on the same sector.In parallel, Riyadh Air has been forming strategic partnerships to expand its global reach, including a memorandum of understanding with Delta Air Lines to explore potential codesharing and loyalty program alignment.Alongside the launch announcement, Riyadh Air introduced Sfeer, a digital-first loyalty program designed to reflect modern user behavior and local cultural values. The name — which means “ambassador” in Arabic and echoes the English word “sphere” — captures the program’s vision of building a connected and collaborative member community.Unlike traditional airline programs that reward individual travel spend, Sfeer promotes engagement, inclusivity, and shared progress. Members can share level points with family and friends, advancing together toward higher tiers — a model the airline says reflects Saudi values of generosity and togetherness.In its early access phase, Sfeer is open to Riyadh Air’s internal community, but it will be expanded in phases. Early registrants, dubbed “Founders,” will gain priority access to ticket sales on upcoming flights and invitations to exclusive events. When fully launched in 2026, the program will include gamified challenges, member leaderboards, and a no-expiry points policy. Additional benefits will include complimentary onboard Wi-Fi and special partner offers.Douglas positioned Sfeer as a loyalty program that goes beyond points.“We’re emphasizing inclusivity and engagement, rather than the individual transactional models of traditional airline loyalty programs,” he said. “We want this to be community-driven and digitally immersive — not just another points system.”Riyadh Air has also unveiled its first premium lounge, the ‘Hafawa Lounge’ — located between Terminals 1 and 2 at King Khalid International Airport.The lounge is positioned as an extension of Riyadh Air’s commitment to providing a luxury experience and serves as part of its overall operational trial period. As the airline ramps up toward full public service, every touchpoint, from lounge to inflight, is being tested and refined.Riyadh Air was established in March 2023 by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman as a central pillar of Saudi Arabia’s Vision 2030 — the national strategy aimed at diversifying the economy and reducing reliance on oil. The airline’s objectives are closely aligned with the broader ambitions of its owner, the Public Investment Fund (PIF), which include transforming Riyadh into a global aviation hub, attracting 330 million passengers annually by 2030, and enhancing international connectivity through strategic partnerships.One such partnership includes a memorandum of understanding with Delta Air Lines to explore future code-sharing agreements and potential loyalty program integration. Riyadh Air forms just one part of the PIF’s expansive investments in the aviation ecosystem, which also span airports, logistics, and supporting infrastructure across the Kingdom.","Riyadh Air will launch its first London flights on October 26 using a leased Boeing 787-9 for staff only.

China files plaint against India at WTO over EV sops,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/china-files-plaint-against-india-at-wto-over-ev-sops/articleshow/124592623.cms,".





China has filed a complaint against India at WTO over New Delhi’s subsidies for electric vehicles and batteries. The Chinese commerce ministry has alleged that the measures by India violate several WTO obligations, including the principle of national treatment, and constitute import substitution subsidies.These measures unfairly benefit India’s domestic industries and undermine China’s legitimate interests, the ministry’s statement claimed. China’s complaint about India’s reported EV subsidies comes as Beijing seeks to boost exports of its EVs to India. This follows the two countries’ initiative to normalise relations after a five-year freeze in ties due to the Eastern Ladakh military standoff.Considering the size and scope of India’s auto market, Chinese EV automakers see it as a major source to expand sales. According to reports, facing overcapacity with large production of EVs and declining domestic sales and profits amid price wars, Chinese hybrid car makers like BYD are looking for overseas markets, especially in the EU and Asia.",China has filed a complaint against India at WTO over New Delhi’s subsidies for electric vehicles and batteries.

A consortium led by global asset manager BlackRock, along with chipmaker Nvidia and tech giant Microsoft, is set to acquire Aligned Data Centers from Australian financial services major Macquarie in a deal valued at around $40 billion.The acquisition underscores the tech sector’s escalating race to build artificial intelligence infrastructure — from chips and servers to large-scale data centers that power AI computing and storage needs.According to AFP, Aligned, founded in 2013, operates more than 50 data centers across the United States, Mexico, Brazil, Chile, and Colombia, with a projected total capacity of over 5 gigawatts. Macquarie first invested in the Texas-based company in 2018 through its asset management arm and expanded its stake in 2020.The consortium — comprising BlackRock, Emirati sovereign tech fund MGX, and the Artificial Intelligence Infrastructure Partnership (AIP) — plans to use a mix of $30 billion in direct investments and leveraged debt to reach an overall investment capacity of $100 billion. AIP was set up in 2024 by BlackRock in partnership with MGX, Nvidia, and Microsoft.“The acquisition allows our clients to participate directly in the growth of AI,” BlackRock CEO and AIP Chairman Larry Fink said in a statement.

: Salesforce chief executive Marc Benioff described India as a “model market” for how multinational technology firms can build at scale while integrating philanthropy and local leadership.At a media interaction during Dreamforce 2025, Benioff said India and the surrounding region, including Nepal, Bhutan and Southeast Asia, “have a huge place in my heart” and remain critical to how the company thinks about global growth and innovation.“Even other companies, I won’t go through the names, come to us and ask how we built a great company in India.

China on Wednesday termed Donald Trump 's 100% tariff threat as the ""wrong approach"" to deal with Beijing, as it went on to defend its export control measures on rare earths and related items.

Wall Street advanced on Wednesday as robust earnings from major technology and banking firms overshadowed lingering US-China trade concerns. The S&P 500 gained 0.9%, recovering from a volatile session, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 320 points, or 0.7%, and the Nasdaq composite climbed 1.1% by 10 a.m. Eastern time, driven largely by strength in semiconductor and tech stocks, AP reported.Tech sector gains were led by ASML, the Dutch semiconductor equipment supplier, which expects 2025 revenue to be 15% higher than last year, with next year projected to match or exceed current levels. “On the market side, we have seen continued positive momentum around investments in AI, and have also seen this extending to more customers,” CEO Christophe Fouquet said. Nvidia added 1.2% and Broadcom rose 3%, helping lift the S&P 500.Bank earnings also supported the rally. Bank of America climbed 3.9% after posting stronger-than-expected profits across all business lines, while Morgan Stanley jumped 6.9%. PNC Financial fell 3.9% despite beating profit estimates, following a cautious earnings forecast. Abbott Laboratories dropped 2.8% after narrowly missing revenue expectations.Investors remain focused on corporate profits as key indicators of the US economic outlook amid a delayed government shutdown, which has postponed critical economic reports, including inflation data. The Federal Reserve, which cut its main interest rate last month and signaled potential further reductions, faces uncertainty in balancing inflationary pressures and job market support.Geopolitical tensions between the US and China also continue to weigh on markets, particularly concerns over China’s export restrictions on rare earths, vital for electronics and aerospace industries.

It's ""China versus the world,"" asserted US treasury secretary Scott Bessent on Wednesday slamming Beijing’s rare earth export curbs, further vowing that Washington and its allies would ""neither be commanded nor controlled. """"If some in the Chinese government want to slow down the global economy through disappointing actions and through economic coercion, the Chinese economy will be hurt the most — and make no mistake: this is China vs. the world,"" Bessent told reporters at a press conference, during the IMF and World Bank fall meetings in Washington.""This should be a clear sign to our allies that we must work together, and we will.... We do not want to decouple. We should work together to de-risk and diversify our supply chains away from China as quickly as possible,"" Bessent added.His remarks came days after Beijing imposed fresh controls on exporting rare earth technologies and materials, prompting the US to threaten an additional 100% tariff on Chinese goods, raising total duties to 130% starting November.Referring to internal political dynamics in China, Bessent said it was unclear whether the curbs represented a split within Beijing’s trade team but dismissed the notion that China intended to be an ""agent of chaos.""He recounted earlier threats from a lower-level Chinese trade official stating that, ""There was a lower-level trade person who was slightly unhinged here in August … saying that China would unleash chaos on the global system if the US went ahead with our docking fees for Chinese ships.""""I don’t believe China wants to be an agent of chaos,"" Bessent asserted.Trade tensions between the two powers have escalated during President Trump ’s second term, with tit-for-tat duties reaching triple-digit levels before a temporary truce.Trump last week responded by threatening to hike tariffs on Chinese goods to triple-digit levels, rattling financial markets and straining US-China relations.This came after Beijing's latest rules, announced on October 9 that require both Chinese and foreign firms to seek government approval before exporting any product containing more than 0.1% rare earth elements by value. The curbs also extend to additional minerals and ban exports for foreign military use.China currently controls about 70% of global rare earth mining and nearly 90% of processing, giving it huge leverage over industries critical to global manufacturing, including electric vehicles, semiconductors, and defense.Bessent, however said that Washington might consider extending the pause on higher tariffs if China delays implementing its rare earth export curbs.In an effort to avoid further escalation, Bessent confirmed that President Trump is ready to meet Chinese President Xi Jinping in South Korea later this month, with officials from both sides in daily contact to arrange the meeting.It was due to trust between Trump and Xi that the trade conflict between the two countries has not escalated further, he told CNBC, highlighting that the countries were close to a return to an all-out trade war after China announced the expanded controls last week.Earlier, speaking to Fox Business on Monday, Bessent had even earlier called Beijing's move a direct challenge to the global economy, saying, ""This is China versus the rest of the world.""He stressed that the US would not allow China to weaponise its rare earth dominance, critical for defense, electric vehicles, and electronics. ""They have pointed a bazooka at the supply chains and the industrial base of the entire free world. And, you know, we're not going to have it. China is a command and control economy. They are neither going to command [nor] control us,"" he said.""We are going to assert our sovereignty in various ways. We have already been in touch with the allies. We will be meeting with them this week and, you know, I expect that we will get substantial global support from the Europeans, from the Indians, from the democracies in Asia,"" he added.The situation underscores ongoing tensions over global supply chains and rare earth materials, a sector critical to technology, defense, and manufacturing worldwide.","US treasury secretary Scott Bessent slammed Beijing’s rare earth export curbs, vowing that Washington and its allies would ""neither be commanded nor controlled"" China imposed fresh controls on exporting rare earth technologies and materials, prompting the US to threaten an additional 100% tariff on Chinese goods.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124583073,imgsize-50222,width-400,resizemode-4/.jpg"

Trump Aide Angers China, Shoots 'Tit-For-Tat' Warning As Tariff War Snowballs | 'Brute-force If...'





China hit back at the US on Wednesday, warning that trade conflicts create ""no winners"" after President Donald Trump raised the possibility of halting cooking oil imports from China.When asked about Trump’s threat, China’s foreign ministry said trade disagreements were “not in the interests of any party.” The product in question is used in biofuels, including biodiesel and sustainable aviation fuel.“The two sides should resolve relevant issues through consultation on the basis of equality, respect and mutual benefit,” spokesman Lin Jian said during a press conference. “China's position on China-US economic and trade issues is consistent and clear,” he added, noting that Chinese leaders had “made clear their position” on recent policies. Lin also justified the controls as necessary “to better safeguard world peace and regional stability and fulfill international obligations such as non-proliferation. ”Trump issued his warning following Beijing’s suspension of US soybean purchases, which he labelled an “economically hostile act.” “We are considering terminating business with China having to do with Cooking Oil, and other elements of Trade, as retribution,” he said via Truth Social.Despite easing tensions compared with earlier this year, a long-term agreement between Washington and Beijing remains uncertain.Last week, China implemented restrictions on rare earth technology exports and other items, prompting Trump to signal a potential 100 percent tariff on Chinese goods starting November 1. Last year, the US was China’s largest buyer of used cooking oil, purchasing 1.27 million tonnes—over a 50 percent increase from 2023—accounting for more than 40 percent of China’s exports of the product, according to the US Department of Agriculture.Beijing defended its rare earth export limits as necessary for global security after EU trade commissioner Maros Sefcovic deemed them unjustified. China dominates global production of these minerals, which are critical for manufacturing magnets used in automotive, electronics, and defence industries.","China warns that trade conflicts create ""no winners"" after President Donald Trump raised possibility of halting cooking oil imports from China.

Asian stocks today: Markets open on the higher end; Fed cut hopes outweigh trade war fears,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/asian-stocks-today-markets-open-on-the-higher-end-fed-cut-hopes-outweigh-trade-war-fears/articleshow/124566741.cms,"Representative AI image





Asian stocks jumped on Wednesday as trade war fears were overshadowed by comments from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, who suggested the bank could cut interest rates again this month.Asian markets opened on the higher end (moderately), following Wall Street’s lead. Tokyo’s Nikkei 225 rose 1.3 percent to 47,463.31, Hong Kong’s Hang Seng gained 1.5 percent to 25,826.42, and Shanghai’s Composite added 0.4 percent to 3,881.03. Taipei, Seoul, Sydney, Singapore, and Wellington also advanced, reflecting renewed investor optimism. Shanghai rose despite data showing Chinese consumer prices fell in September, indicating weak consumer sentiment.After a volatile couple of days marked by fresh flare-ups in US-China tensions, investors returned to markets, resuming a months-long, tech-fuelled rally. Powell has spent most of the year balancing efforts to cap inflation with supporting the labor market, even as President Donald Trump criticised him for not lowering borrowing costs quickly enough.Although price gains continue to exceed the Fed's target, weak economic readings have forced Powell to shift focus toward jobs.The central bank announced its first rate cut since December last month, and on Tuesday, Powell indicated more could follow. ""In this less dynamic and somewhat softer labour market, the downside risks to employment appear to have risen,"" he said, adding that longer-term inflation expectations remain aligned with the Fed's two-percent goal.Powell also hinted that the Fed could pause reductions in its bond holdings acquired during the pandemic to keep borrowing rates low and support the economy. No official jobs data has been released for September due to the US government shutdown, but private sector figures point to a marked slowdown in hiring.US markets ended mostly lower on Tuesdays but well off morning lows, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average up 0.4 percent at 46,270.46, and London’s FTSE 100 climbing 0.1 percent to 9,452.77.Powell’s remarks helped investors turn attention away from the latest trade salvos between Washington and Beijing. Last week, Trump had threatened 100-percent tariffs on Chinese rare earths, but he softened his tone on Sunday. China, however, imposed sanctions on five American subsidiaries of South Korean shipbuilder Hanwha Ocean, accusing them of supporting Washington’s shipping industry probe.Trump said, ""We have a fair relationship with China, and I think it'll be fine. And if it's not, that's OK too. We have a lot of punches being thrown, and we've been very successful."" Meanwhile, US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer described Monday’s discussions on the rare earth dispute as broadly positive, saying, ""We’ve been pretty successful in finding a path forward with them in the past so we think we'll be able to work through it. ""Currency and commodities also saw small movements. The euro rose to $1.1621, the pound strengthened to $1.3348, and the dollar slipped to 151.17 yen.

AI exuberance like dot-com boom: IMF,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/ai-exuberance-like-dot-com-boom-imf/articleshow/124565287.cms,".





New Delhi: The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has cautioned that the surging investment in artificial intelligence echoes the dot-com boom of the late 1990s and it could pose risks. IMF chief economist Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas said in a blog after the release of the World Economic Outlook update that optimism is fuelling tech investment, lifting stock valuations, and boosting consumption via capital gains.“This could push the real neutral interest rate upwards. Continued exuberance may require tighter monetary policy just as in the late 1990s,” said Gourinchas. “But there is also a flip side. Markets could reprice sharply, especially if AI fails to justify lofty profit expectations. That would dent wealth and curb consumption, with adverse effects potentially reverberating through the financial system,” the IMF chief economist cautioned in his blog under the sub-title “The AI surge, promise or peril?”WEO also said an abrupt repricing of tech stocks could be triggered by disappointing results on earnings and productivity gains related to artificial intelligence (AI), marking an end to the AI investment boom and the associated exuberance of financial markets, with the possibility of broader implications for macro-financial stability.It said that much of the year’s equity market gains have come from a rally in artificial intelligence (AI) stocks. “The stretched valuations and calm relative to the challenges raise the risk of market volatility and asset price correction should uncertainty start biting and economic indicators, including productivity gains from generative AI investments, start to disappoint.“The decline in aggregate investment could be rather sharp, given that investment in data centers and AI was a significant contributor to investment growth recently,” according to the WEO. The report also said that artificial intelligence is reigniting productivity growth. “Faster AI adoption could help unleash strong productivity gains as firms increase uptake of the various AI-based tools being developed and deployed at high speed,” said the report.","The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has cautioned that the surging investment in artificial intelligence echoes the dot-com boom of the late 1990s.

US jobs concern: Jerome Powell sees rising unemployment risks; Federal Reserve may cut rates twice more this year,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-jobs-concern-jerome-powell-sees-rising-unemployment-risks-federal-reserve-may-cut-rates-twice-more-this-year/articleshow/124558006.cms,"



Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell warned on Tuesday that the sharp slowdown in US hiring poses increasing risks to the economy, suggesting the central bank may reduce its key interest rate two more times before the year ends.In written remarks ahead of a meeting of the National Association of Business Economics in Philadelphia, Powell noted that despite the federal government shutdown cutting off official economic data, “the outlook for employment and inflation does not appear to have changed much since our September meeting,” when the Fed reduced its key rate for the first time this year, AP reported.At that September meeting, Fed officials forecast two additional rate cuts in 2025 and one in 2026. Lower rates could ease borrowing costs for mortgages, car loans, and business loans.Powell reiterated that the Fed is slightly more concerned about the job market than its other mandate of keeping prices stable. While tariffs have lifted the Fed's preferred measure of inflation to 2.9%, he said, there are no “broader inflationary pressures” that would keep prices elevated.“Rising downside risks to employment have shifted our assessment of the balance of risks,” Powell said.The Fed chair also indicated that the central bank may soon stop shrinking its roughly $6.6 trillion balance sheet. The Fed has been allowing about $40 billion of Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities to mature each month without replacing them, a policy that could influence longer-term Treasury yields.Powell spent much of his speech defending the Fed’s earlier purchases of longer-term Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities during 2020 and 2021, measures intended to lower longer-term rates and support the economy during the pandemic.Those purchases have been criticised by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and some potential Trump administration nominees to replace Powell next May. Critics argue the bond purchases exacerbated inequality by boosting the stock market without materially benefiting the economy and that the Fed continued purchases too long even as inflation surged in late 2021.“With the clarity of hindsight, we could have—and perhaps should have—stopped asset purchases sooner,” Powell said. “Our real-time decisions were intended to serve as insurance against downside risk.”He added that the purchases were also aimed at preventing a breakdown in the Treasury securities market, which could have sent interest rates significantly higher.","Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell warned on Tuesday that the sharp slowdown in US hiring poses increasing risks to the economy.

From chips to ships: China just weaponised the sea,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-china-trade-war-xi-jinping-donald-trump-china-escalates-us-trade-fight-with-curbs-on-shipping/articleshow/124555923.cms,"TL;DR: Driving the news

China sanctioned the US units of South Korea’s Hanwha Ocean and warned of more retaliatory steps across shipping - a fresh front in the escalating China-US trade war just as both countries roll out tit-for-tat port fees.

The move “helped fuel a slump in global equities” and signaled a broader fight over maritime dominance, Bloomberg reported. “This is a broadening and expansion of the ongoing trade conflict,” Deborah Elms of the Hinrich Foundation told Bloomberg. “It’s no longer just about tariffs and export controls, but which firms have the ability to operate in which markets. If this continues, a lot more economic activities are at risk.”

At the same time, the US began charging fees on Chinese ships docking at American ports - penalties aimed at countering China’s shipbuilding supremacy and nudging orders away from Chinese yards.

“Anything we can do to chip away at the disparity in shipbuilding that exists between the United States and China is to our benefit,” Mihir Torsekar of the Coalition for a Prosperous America told the NYT.

Why it matters

Ships move over 80% of global trade, so port levies and sanctions can ripple through everything from crude and LNG to toys and sofas, raising shipping costs and delivery times across supply chains.

Allies are in the crosshairs. By sanctioning Hanwha’s US units, Beijing is warning third-country firms that help Washington they could lose China access - a pressure test for South Korea and others balancing security ties with US market exposure.

Capacity reshuffle = higher costs. Carriers are already reassigning ships to dodge fees on Chinese-built vessels calling at US ports; analysts say 11% of container ships and 13% of crude tankers could be affected, a meaningful slice that can snarl routes and lift rates.

China’s scale advantage is stubborn. With 60% of global large-vessel output in 2024 and faster, cheaper builds, China’s yards remain hard to dislodge - meaning US fees may re-route traffic more than they rebuild domestic capacity in the near term.

Floating tariffs, sinking certainty

A broader economic risk

The standoff is playing out just as the IMF nudged up its forecast for US economic growth to 2% in 2025, citing resilient consumer demand and investment in AI infrastructure. Yet even the IMF acknowledged the gains might be short-lived if tariffs escalate. “The tariff shock is here,” said chief economist Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas, “and it is further dimming already weak growth prospects.”

The agency noted that importers and retailers in the US-not foreign producers-are bearing the brunt of the new duties. And over time, those costs are likely to bleed into consumer prices.

On Friday, US President Donald Trump threatened to slap 100% tariffs on all Chinese goods by November 1 if Beijing doesn’t relent on rare earth restrictions. Within hours, markets dropped, and Chinese state media accused Washington of ""economic coercion.""

threatened to slap 100% tariffs on all Chinese goods by November 1 if Beijing doesn’t relent on rare earth restrictions. Within hours, markets dropped, and Chinese state media accused Washington of ""economic coercion."" Trump took to Truth Social to cool the rhetoric, posting: “Don’t worry about China. It will all be fine!” But behind the scenes, talks between Vice finance minister Liao Min and US Treasury officials are ongoing in Washington.

“China’s door remains open,” the commerce ministry said. “But if the US chooses confrontation, China will see it through to the end.”

Don’t worry about China, it will all be fine! Highly respected President Xi just had a bad moment. He doesn’t want Depression for his country, and neither do I. The U.S.A. wants to help China, not hurt it!!! President DJT Donald Trump on Truth Social

Bottom line





Beijing has fired its latest salvo in the simmering US-China trade war-not through semiconductors or soybeans, but through ships. China imposed sanctions on the US subsidiaries of South Korean shipbuilding giant Hanwha Ocean Co, citing the company’s support of an American trade probe as grounds for economic punishment.At the heart of the dispute is control over the ocean highways of global commerce. China, over the past decade, has quietly built a commanding lead in shipbuilding, outpacing South Korea and Japan to control 60% of large vessel production by 2024. The US, by contrast, made just one such ship that year.Trump’s administration, frustrated by years of imbalance, has tried to reverse course. On Tuesday, it began imposing new port fees on Chinese ships-part of a broader effort to resuscitate a withered US shipbuilding industry. In return, China hit American ships with fees of its own. The fees target any vessel owned, operated, built, or flagged by the opposing country, turning each nation’s ports into tollbooths in a maritime standoff.Both sides have carved out technical exemptions-China, for example, said Chinese-built ships are exempt from its new port levies-but the message is unmistakable.Trade is no longer safe in open waters.“This tit-for-tat symmetry locks both economies into a spiral of maritime taxation,risking distortions in global freight flows,” Athens-based Xclusiv Shipbrokers told Reuters.At the same time, Trump has widened his tariff campaign at home. New duties-ranging from 10% on raw wood to 50% on kitchen cabinets-also took effect Tuesday, targeting everything from timber to upholstered furniture. Trump defended the move under the rarely-invoked Section 232 of the 1962 Trade Expansion Act, which allows tariffs on national security grounds. His logic? Furniture and wood are essential to military infrastructure.As per a NYT report, critics call it a stretch. “If war broke out tomorrow,” wrote Scott Lincicome of the Cato Institute, “there would be zero concern about American ‘dependence’ on foreign lumber.” He called the idea that tariffs would protect national security “absurd.”Retailers and builders are already feeling the pinch. “Getting manufacturing started in the US isn’t easy,” Ethan Allen CEO Farooq Kathwari, who noted his company has factories in Vermont and North Carolina. “We have all these hurdles,” Kathwari told the NYT.Beijing is matching - and expanding - the fight beyond tariff lines to the docks and drydocks, signaling it will penalize firms that abet US probes while leveraging its shipbuilding heft. Washington is betting vessel fees plus fresh tariffs will tilt orders, revive US yards and pry supply chains from China’s orbit. For now, the world’s freight lanes are the battlefield - and the bill for consumers and companies is mounting.(With inputs from agencies)","China sanctioned the US units of South Korea’s Hanwha Ocean and warned of more retaliatory steps across shipping.

Wall Street stocks slipped in early trading on Tuesday as trade tensions with China resurfaced, putting pressure on major indices.

Analysts said the swings reflected shifting sentiment over US-China trade relations.The latest downturn came after China’s Commerce Ministry barred Chinese companies from dealing with five subsidiaries of South Korean shipbuilder Hanwha Ocean, a move seen as countering President Donald Trump’s efforts to rebuild US shipbuilding. European markets were also lower, while Asian markets fell.The ongoing US-China trade conflict continues to weigh on investors, with both nations imposing new port fees on each other’s vessels that took effect on Tuesday. Experts say the dispute is particularly significant given the two countries’ positions as the world’s largest economies.So far, the US economy has avoided major fallout from shifting tariff policies, but analysts warn that a cycle of retaliatory tariffs could lead companies to pass higher costs to consumers.The ongoing US government shutdown has also paused regular economic updates on inflation, spending, and employment, leaving investors focused on corporate earnings for guidance.Among stocks, JPMorgan Chase slipped 3.8 per cent despite beating profit forecasts for its latest quarter, while Wells Fargo rose 3.5 per cent after exceeding analysts’ expectations. Health care giant Johnson & Johnson fell 1.8 per cent after announcing plans to spin off its orthopedics business into a standalone company.Treasury yields remained relatively stable, with the 10-year yield easing slightly to 4.04 per cent from 4.05 per cent on Friday.

It’s a historic low for the US passport! For the first time since Henley Passport Index started releasing passport rankings almost 20 years ago, the US passport has dropped out of the top 10 most powerful or strongest passports in the world rankings!On the other hand, the top 10 list is dominated by Asian countries - with Singapore leading the ranks. A Singapore passport ensures that you have visa-free access to as many as 193 out of 227 destinations tracked by Henley Passport Index. South Korea (190) and Japan (189) follow closely.According to the latest Henley Passport Index data, the US passport has dropped to 12th position, sharing the spot with Malaysia, allowing entry to 180 of 227 destinations.Several factors contributed to the American passport's decline, including Brazil's withdrawal of visa-free entry in April, exclusion from China's expanding visa-free programme, and modifications by Papua New Guinea and Myanmar. Additional changes by Somalia's eVisa system and Vietnam's new visa-free list further affected its standing, according to Henley Passport index.Christian H. Kaelin, Chairman of Henley & Partners, said: ""The declining strength of the US passport over the past decade is more than just a reshuffle in rankings — it signals a fundamental shift in global mobility and soft power dynamics. Nations that embrace openness and cooperation are surging ahead, while those resting on past privilege are being left behind.""The British passport has also experienced a decline, moving from 6th to 8th position since July, despite having led the index in 2015.American passport holders enjoy visa-free access to 180 destinations, whilst the United States permits only 46 nationalities to enter without visas. This positions the US at 77th place on the Henley Openness Index, a measure of national receptiveness to international visitors.The United States demonstrates one of the world's largest disparities between its outbound visa-free privileges and inbound visa requirements, ranking near Australia and marginally ahead of Canada, New Zealand, and Japan, the statement said.Annie Pforzheimer, Senior Associate at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said, ""Even before a second Trump presidency, US policy had turned inward. That isolationist mindset is now being reflected in America's loss of passport power.""Meanwhile, China has achieved notable progress. Its global ranking has improved from 94th in 2015 to 64th in 2025, gaining access to 37 additional visa-free destinations. China's position on the Henley Openness Index reached 65th after providing visa-free entry to 76 nations, surpassing the US by 30 countries.China's diplomatic achievements include recent visa-free arrangements with Russia, Gulf states, South American nations, and European partners, demonstrating its commitment to international engagement.As per the latest rankings, India stands at 85th position with visa-free access to 57 countries.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground.Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change, too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

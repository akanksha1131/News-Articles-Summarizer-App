Stock market recommendations:Nifty during last week on expected lines consolidated in the range of 23,000-23,800 after a 8.5% rally in the preceding 15 sessions. Index in the process worked off the overbought condition developed after the recent sharp rally.Key observation in the daily chart of Nifty is that it has already taken 7 sessions to retrace just 50% of its preceding 6 sessions up move (22,353-23,869). A shallow retracement signals overall positive price structure and a higher base formation above the 50 days EMA. Nifty during the current consolidation phase has absorbed the entire volatility related to US tariff highlighting strength. Hence, we believe the current breather should be used as a buying opportunity in quality stocks in a staggered manner.Going ahead, in the coming week we expect the index to resume up move after the recent breather and gradually head higher towards 23,869 (last week high) and then towards 24,200 levels in the coming weeks being the high of January 2025 and 50% retracement of the entire 5 months decline (26,277-21965)On the downside, 23,000-22,700 would act as strong support being the confluence of the recent breakout area and 50% and 61.8% retracement area of the recent up move from 21965-23869.The recent sharp decline of US 10-year yields below 4.2%, Dollar index below 104 and Brent crude staying below $ 75 is positive sign for India’s economy and Equity market.","According to Bajaj Broking Research, NHPC and Symphony are the top stock picks for today.

Income Tax Changes FY 2025-26: April 1, 2025, signals the start of the fresh fiscal year. As the new financial year begins, several new income tax regulations come into effect, including a more rationalised new income tax regime, higher basic exemption limit and tax rates. Additionally, several changes in TDS, TCS rules also take effect.Understanding these new income tax rules is crucial, as they influence tax deductions from various income sources, including salary and interest earnings. Additionally, these changes will determine your tax liability for income earned in FY 2025-26.The revised new tax regime introduces new income tax slabs and rates. Under the new income tax regime income above Rs 24 lakh will now attract a 30% tax rate as against Rs 15 lakh earlier. Also, the basic exemption limit has been raised from Rs 3 lakh to Rs 4 lakh.With changes in the new income tax regime, individuals earning a taxable income up to Rs 12 lakh will now have to pay ZERO tax! This provision applies exclusively to individuals who select the new tax regime in FY 2025-26. However, this does not exempt one from filing an income tax return (ITR). The zero tax benefit is available through a tax rebate under Section 87A of the Income Tax Act, 1961.To access the tax rebate under Section 87A, individuals must submit their ITR. For salaried individuals earning up to Rs 12.75 lakh, there will be no tax with a Rs 75,000 standard deduction.Also Read | How to calculate income tax with latest tax slabs: Have taxable income above Rs 12 lakh? Know how it will be taxed under new income tax regime The Budget 2025 has introduced modifications to the taxation structure of specific ULIPs. The revised regulations specify that ULIP proceeds not qualifying for exemption under Section 10 (10D) shall be classified as capital assets and will be incorporated within the equity-oriented funds category, according to an ET report.Consequently, proceeds from ULIPs that do not qualify for Section 10 (10D) exemption will face capital gains taxation. A 20% tax rate applies to short-term gains, whilst long-term gains attract a 12.5% tax without the benefit of indexation.Tax exemption under Section 10 (10D) continues to apply to ULIP proceeds where the annual premium remains below Rs 2.5 lakh.Tax experts note that previously, there existed no definitive taxation guidelines for ULIPs with premiums exceeding Rs 2.5 lakh. This ambiguity arose because ULIPs, unlike conventional policies, direct a substantial portion of premiums towards stock market investments, making traditional policy taxation frameworks unsuitable. These taxation revisions take effect from FY 2025-26.The Budget 2025 has introduced modifications to TDS provisions, encompassing adjustments to rates and elevating thresholds for implementing these provisions.Key TDS amendments include:a) Section 194LBC TDS rate adjustment: This applies to income distributed by securitisation trust to resident investors. Currently, until March 31, 2025, individuals or Hindu Undivided families face 25% TDS, whilst others face 30%. Starting April 1, 2025, a uniform 10% TDS rate shall apply.b) Threshold adjustments: Effective April 1, 2025, elevated thresholds will apply to sections 193, 194A, 194, 194K, 194B, 194BB, 194D, 194G, 194H, 194-I, 194J and 194LA, enabling taxpayers to retain more disposable income.The government has eliminated provisions requiring increased TDS and TCS rates for ITR non-filers. This revision takes effect from April 1, 2025, removing higher TDS and TCS obligations for those who haven't submitted ITRs in specified periods.The Budget 2025 memorandum states: ""Section 206AB of the Act, requires deduction of tax at higher rate when the deductee specified therein is a non-filer of income-tax return. Section 206CCA of the Act, requires for collection of tax at higher rate when the collectee specified therein is a non-filer of income-tax return. This is subject to other conditions specified in the two sections. Representations were received from various stakeholders that it is difficult for the deductor/collector, at the time of deduction/collection, to verify whether returns have been filed by the deductee/collectee, resulting in application of higher rates of deduction/collection, blocking of capital and increased compliance burden. Accordingly, to address this issue and reduce compliance burden for the deductor/collector, it is proposed to omit section 206AB of the Act and section 206CCA of the Act.""Also Read | Latest income tax slabs FY 2025-26: What are the new income tax slabs, rates after Budget 2025 announcements? Check new vs old tax regime comparison - FAQs answered The recent Budget 2025 has incorporated NPS Vatsalya contributions within Section 80CCD framework. Individuals can now avail deductions for their NPS Vatsalya contributions under this section. This benefit remains exclusive to taxpayers who continue with the old tax regime.Starting April 1, 2025, the Budget has revised the tax-free perquisite thresholds for employed individuals. The updated regulations permit tax exemption on employer-funded international medical treatment expenses, covering both employees and their family members.Starting April 1, 2025, the authorities have granted immunity from legal proceedings for delayed Tax Collected at Source (TCS) payments under specific circumstances. The revised regulations specify that no legal action shall commence against individuals who remit TCS to the Central Government before the prescribed deadline for submitting quarterly statements.Also Read | Budget 2025 Income Tax calculator explained: Save up to Rs 1.1 lakh! How income tax slab changes will benefit taxpayers at different salary levels under new regime The timeframe for submitting updated returns has been lengthened. Under the revised regulations effective April 1, 2025, individuals now have 48 months from the assessment year's conclusion to submit their updated returns. Previously, taxpayers were allowed 24 months post-assessment year to file these returns. The new provision doubles the available time period.The tax authorities have streamlined the process of calculating annual house value for taxation purposes. This revision enables straightforward income tax filing by allowing nil value declaration for any two properties.The authorities have modified the annual value definition for self-occupied properties, providing clarity to homeowners whilst maintaining the existing two-property restriction.Beginning April 1, 2025, tax officials will conduct comparative analyses between current and previous Income Tax Returns (ITRs) to identify inconsistencies. This provision takes effect from April 1, 2025. Whilst the implementation date is confirmed, the tax authority has not yet detailed which specific discrepancies they will examine across both ITRs.Also Read | How much tax do individuals earning slightly above Rs 12 lakh have to pay? Marginal relief calculations explained","New income tax laws come into effect today, that is April 1, 2025. Under the new income tax regime income above Rs 24 lakh will now attract a 30% tax rate.

Rupee's recovery to 85/$ adds to exporters' woes,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/rupees-recovery-to-85/-adds-to-exporters-woes/articleshow/119995502.cms,"MUMBAI: The rupee briefly regained 84 levels to touch a 2025 high of 84.97 against the dollar on Friday as the greenback weakened globally before closing at 85.24, up 19 paise from Thursday's close of 85.43. The strengthening of the rupee is expected to hurt exporters. The dollar index, which tracks the greenback's movement against six major currencies, was down 0.4% at 101.64. According to analysts, the rupee found support from weaker crude prices, though a firm dollar index limited further gains.Meanwhile, forex reserves rose by $6.6 billion to $665.4 billion in the week ended March 28, marking the fourth straight weekly rise. The increase follows recent declines caused by revaluation and RBI interventions to manage rupee volatility. Foreign currency assets, the largest component of the reserves, rose by $6.2 billion to $565 billion.""The rupee is currently less vulnerable, except in scenarios involving competitive currency devaluation, particularly by the Chinese yuan,"" said Jitendra Gohil of Kotak Alternate Asset managers. He added that while net interest margins may face pressure if the RBI cuts rates, this could be offset by faster credit growth.""The dollar index's positive rally capped further appreciation in the rupee,"" said Jateen Trivedi of LKP Securities. He added that with non-farm payroll (NFP) data & unemployment data scheduled for release in the evening, markets are expected to remain cautious, and the rupee may react sharply depending on the outcome.The dollar recorded its steepest single-day drop since late 2022 following the announcement of broad tariffs, even as stock markets fell. Investors moved away from the dollar, raising concerns over its weakening safe-haven status. Analysts attributed the shift to protectionist policies, rising debt, and growing doubts over the economic leadership of the issuing country.

"Trump's tariffs: Exporters seek restoration of benefits, bilateral deal push",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/trumps-tariffs-exporters-seek-restoration-of-benefits-bilateral-deal-push/articleshow/119995365.cms,"NEW DELHI: Staring at a steep dent, exporters have asked govt to restore several benefits that have been stopped, such as the interest equalisation scheme and Remission of Duties and Taxes on Exported Products (RODTEP) for SEZ and export oriented units, while prioritising sectors that will be more adversely hit by Trump's tariffs during the first tranche of the trade agreement with the US.While life is looking challenging for all sectors, given the steep 26% levy imposed on all Indian exports to the US, marine products, dairy, medical equipment, machinery and carpets are among sectors that are seen to be the hardest hit. Given that these are also labour intensive sectors, govt may be inclined to push them more aggressively.Sources, however, indicated that there is no clarity on how the Trump administration will lower tariffs even if govt were to offer immediate concessions, which would be permanent in nature.A day after the tariff hike was announced, govt departments actually got down to gauge the impact. Several exporters, who were drawing from India's tariffs being lower than some of its rivals were also more measured in their response, having assessed the possible extent of damage.A section of businesses has petitioned that govt should seek a deferment of reciprocal tariffs with the US authorities, given that India is already negotiating a bilateral trade deal. Officials, however, see little chance of Trump agreeing to accept the demand.Sources in govt, however, appeared more amenable to accepting some of the demands of exporters, particularly enabling them to beat some of the handicap by allowing for interest subsidy, especially for labour intensive sectors, such as textiles, leather and handicrafts.The scheme was discontinued in Jan and despite repeated suggestions from the commerce department, the finance ministry has refused to restart it. Similarly, RODTEP stopped in Feb for a section of exporters while the entire scheme is due to end in Sept with no guarantee of extension. ""It will provide much-needed certainty,"" said an industry executive.The commerce department is working on some other steps, which are expected to be expedited now.Some exporters have suggested that govt provide some assistance in helping them diversify their markets at a time when every country is seeking to reduce their exposure to the US and derisk their exports. Besides, the proposal is meant to ensure some of the edge that will accrue to countries like Turkiye in, say, textiles can be blunted with the support.","Exporters have asked govt to restore several benefits that have been stopped.

Window opens for fuel price cut as US-China tariff war trips oil prices,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/window-opens-for-fuel-price-cut-as-us-china-tariff-war-trips-oil-prices/articleshow/119991718.cms,"Donald Trump announced tariffs on exporters to the US, including 20% on the European Union and 24% on Japan.

NEW DELHI: Oil prices on Friday hit their lowest since the middle of 2021 as China’s return fire against US president Donald Trump’s reciprocal tariff rippled across markets, giving the Centre an an opportunity to partly cushion the impact by letting state-run fuel retailers reduce pump rates.Benchmark Brent slipped $5.55 a barrel, or nearly 7.9%, to $64.59 after hitting $64.15 intraday. US WTI crude lost $5.87, or 8.8%, to $61 after touching $60.81 a barrel, Reuters reported.Thursday’s decision by OPEC+ grouping to hasten plans to pump up volumes, even as clouds of a trade war and recession started gathering after Trump’s April 2 tariff move, exacerbated oil’s woes. Goldman Sachs became the latest investment bank to lower forecast for Brent this year by 5.5% to $69 a barrel citing those fears.The projection gives a window to cut fuel prices, which will help reduce the inflationary impact of US tariffs on India. Oil minister Hardeep Puri last week agreed expectations of a fuel price cut were “reasonable”. “I can tell you seriously if the audience asks when will fuel prices come down further, I would say if this trend (low oil prices) continues, there is reasonable expectation (of a fuel price cut),” Puri told the Times Now Summit 2025.Cheaper fuel will lower energy costs for the economy and allow household budgets some breather. Since India meets 85% of its oil requirement through imports, subdued prices will bring down the import bill and current account deficit. This will lend support to the Rupee and headroom for social spending to continue.Oil prices have been declining after April last year, except for brief rallies in June and September 2024. But fuel prices have remained frozen since they were last cut by Rs 2 per litre on March 14, 2024, just ahead of the Lok Sabha elections.Before that, prices had remained frozen since May 22, 2022 when the Centre reduced excise duty for the second time after November 4, 2021. The two reductions together had brought down the excise duty on petrol and diesel by a total of Rs 13 and Rs 16 per litre, respectively.","Oil prices on Friday hit their lowest since the middle of 2021.

Why is the market falling today?

The following factors contributed to the stock market crash today:

1) Trade War Concerns Following Trump's Tariff Announcement

Poll What do you think is the primary reason for the Indian stock market crash today? Global Recession Fears Trade War Concerns

2) Global Markets Tumble Amid Recession Concerns

3) Indian Pharmaceutical Industry Faces Tariff Pressures

4) Heavyweight stocks drag indices

Stock market crash: Indian stock market indices, BSE Sensex and Nifty50, crashed on Friday amid global market turmoil triggered by growing recession concerns and new tariff declarations from US President Donald Trump. BSE Sensex and Nifty50 plunged over 1%. BSE Sensex closed the day at 75,364.69, down 931 points or 1.22%. Nifty50 ended at 22,904.45, down 346 points or 1.49%.Widespread selling pressure affected all sector-specific indices negatively, with metal, pharmaceutical and information technology shares experiencing substantial declines.The BSE Sensex experienced a significant decline resulting in investors losing Rs 10 lakh crore. This widespread sell-off was influenced by weak performance in global markets and increasing concerns about global trade conflicts. Analysts noted that substantial selling of shares in major companies like Reliance Industries, Larsen & Toubro and Infosys, coupled with a significant decrease in global crude prices signalling recession concerns, contributed to the market downturn.The overall market value of BSE-listed companies decreased by Rs 9,98,379.46 crore, bringing the total market capitalisation to Rs 4,03,34,886.46 crore (USD 4.73 trillion), reflecting the negative sentiment in equity markets.Donald Trump intensified international trade tensions by implementing a universal 10% baseline tariff on U.S. imports. Nations with substantial trade surpluses face elevated tariffs: India (26%), China (34%), EU (20%), South Korea (25%), Vietnam (46%), Taiwan (32%) and Japan (24%).""Markets are going through heightened uncertainty which is likely to last some time. A trade war has been triggered by Trump and retaliatory tariffs from China, EU and others are on the cards. This will only extend the period of uncertainty and confusion in the market,"" said V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Financial Services.

In Asia, Japan's Nikkei 225 experienced a consecutive decline, falling 2.8% during the overnight session. The market atmosphere turned increasingly cautious, evidenced by investors seeking refuge in U.S. Treasury bonds and gold, highlighting heightened concerns about market stability.The pharmaceutical sector in India experienced significant losses after Trump indicated new sector-specific tariffs. Notable companies including Aurobindo Pharma, Laurus Labs, IPCA Laboratories, and Lupin saw declines of up to 7%.During his Air Force One press interaction, Trump announced: ""The pharma is going to be starting to come in at, I think, a level that you haven't really seen before,"" suggesting imminent trade actions.He elaborated on the targeted approach: ""We are looking at pharma as a separate category.

Market meltdown, global fallout

The S&P 500 lost 6%, translating to a staggering $5 trillion in market capitalisation wiped in just two days.

Dow Jones dropped 2,231 points (5.5%) while the Nasdaq tumbled 5.8%, dragging it into bear market territory—over 20% below its record high.

Oil prices sank to their lowest since 2021; copper and other commodities also slumped on recession fears.

Trump unfazed: 'ONLY THE WEAK WILL FAIL'

GE Healthcare, which earns 12% of revenue from China, fell 16%.

DuPont slid 12.7% amid an anti-trust probe by Chinese regulators.

Nintendo delayed preorders for the Switch 2 due to “evolving” trade conditions.

Automakers like Stellantis halted production at North American plants.

Fed Chair warns

A brutal week on Wall Street ended with $5 trillion wiped off the US stock market , as investors recoiled from President Donald Trump’s aggressive tariff hikes. The S&P 500 plummeted 6%, marking its worst weekly performance since March 2020 when the pandemic wreaked havoc on the global economy. Fears of a looming global recession have now intensified as Trump reignited a full-blown trade war.Despite a stronger-than-expected jobs report, confidence was shattered after Trump slapped steep new import duties on dozens of countries, prompting swift retaliation—most notably from China. Investors hoping for relief from the Federal Reserve were left disappointed as Chair Jerome Powell took a cautious “wait and see” stance on rate cuts.China hit back with a 34% tariff on all US imports, effective April 10, matching Trump’s latest move. The response accelerated global market losses and sent shockwaves through trade-heavy industries.Major US trading partners such as Japan, the EU, and Canada began preparing countermeasures. Canada imposed retaliatory tariffs, the EU floated a digital tax on US tech firms, and Tokyo urged calm as it faced 24% tariffs on exports.From his Mar-a-Lago resort, Trump remained defiant, calling the economic chaos a necessary “operation” to fix the trade imbalance. “ONLY THE WEAK WILL FAIL!” he posted on Truth Social. He dismissed market declines as an opportunity: “This is a great time to get rich.”Trump’s tariffs also included a blanket 25% on all foreign-made cars, prompting swift reactions. Nissan reconsidered cuts to US production, while Volvo (owned by China’s Geely) pledged to ramp up manufacturing in America.Fed Chair Powell warned that tariffs could fuel “higher inflation and lower growth” and resisted calls to cut interest rates, citing the risk of unanchored inflation expectations. “Our obligation is to make certain that a one-time increase in price level does not become an ongoing inflation problem,” he said.Trump, in his usual combative style, pushed back: “CUT INTEREST RATES, JEROME, AND STOP PLAYING POLITICS!”The tariffs drew rare bipartisan criticism. Democratic Senator Amy Klobuchar said Trump was “messing around with people’s lives… while he’s out golfing,” and even Republican Senator Ted Cruz warned the policy could “hurt jobs and hurt America.”","The S&P 500 lost 6%, translating to a staggering $5 trillion in market capitalisation wiped in just two days.

Deloitte has been hit hardest by the Trump administration’s consulting cuts , with at least 124 of its federal contracts eliminated or modified since January, Fortune reported.The cuts, led by Elon Musk ’s department of government efficiency ( DOGE ), aim to reduce government spending and have resulted in an estimated $371.8 million in taxpayer savings .According to Fortune, DOGE has cut or modified at least 124 Deloitte contracts since the start of Trump’s second term. These contracts were worth a total of over $1.16 billion, with terminations done worth over $371.8 million. The largest cancelled contract, valued at $51 million, was for IT services for the department of health and human services. Deloitte has faced more contract eliminations than any other consultancy, with Booz Allen Hamilton and Accenture trailing behind.DOGE claims to have saved $140 billion overall, but Bank of America has raised concerns over exaggerated savings, as some listed contract terminations predate Trump’s tenure or ended naturally, reported The New York Times.The cuts have impacted the private sector, as federal contracts are a major source of revenue for consulting firms. Accenture’s CEO Julie Sweet acknowledged in an earnings call that the reductions have hurt the firm’s revenue, with its Federal Services division losing $240.2 million in contracts. Following her remarks, Accenture’s stock dropped by more than 7%.The General Services Administration (GSA) has asked consultancies to submit detailed reports identifying cost-cutting opportunities. “This Administration is firmly of the view that America’s private industry is our backbone… but that’s not inconsistent with right-sizing spending,” said GSA’s Josh Gruenbaum, according to Fortune.While DOGE’s actions have largely spared the defense sector, companies like Booz Allen Hamilton, which rely heavily on Pentagon contracts, remain at risk.

NEW DELHI: Apple does not intend to make any immediate changes to the retail prices of its products such as the flagship iPhone, including in India, following the Trump administration’s imposition of reciprocal tariffs as the company had sent “unusually high” number of shipments from factories in India and China to build up stocks in America despite this being a “relatively lean period”, top sources have told TOI.Apple’s warehouses in the US remain “sufficiently stocked up for the next few months” with products shipped from key manufacturing locations at a “frenetic pace” to beat the start of the higher tax regime, that begins with a baseline 10% tariff from April 5 and thereafter with the addition of respective reciprocal tariffs (different for each country) from April 9.“Factories in India and China and other key locations had been shipping products to the US in anticipation of the higher tariffs coming into play.

Such a step can only be taken once the company makes a full assessment of the supply chain and manufacturing locations, the stipulated tariffs for those countries, and how to balance the production from various regions to provide a cushion to shipments into the high-tax US market,” the source said.Trump’s tariff announcements may end up giving India a larger share in global smartphone production from Apple, though a confirmed word will be out only once America concludes its negotiations with various countries to fix the final rates.Apple, which nearly dominates India’s smartphone export shipments of roughly $9 billion to the US, will find expansion in India more attractive, considering that tariff on New Delhi currently stands at 26%, compared to the peak duty of 54% on China (it primarily makes iPhones in India and China).","Apple does not intend to make any immediate changes to the retail prices of its products such as the flagship iPhone, including in India.

Did Fox News remove its ticker when the stock market collapsed?



President Donald Trump Thursday said he didn't check his 401K account (retirement savings plan) when he was asked about the market crash as a result of his tariffs on about 60 countries. ""I think it's going very well. It was an operation. Like when a patient gets operated on and it's a big thing. I said this would exactly be the way it is,"" the president said a day after Liberation Day.While his reaction was called tone-deaf on social media, personal finance expert Michelle Singletary in her column on Washington Post advised the same: don't look at your 401(k).""Like many of you, I’ve gone without some things I wanted — for decades — so that I could put money in a 401(k). I understand how worrisome this is when you’re the first generation in your family to have money in the stock market. And like you, I have contemplated what should I do on a day like today,"" she wrote.""Except for yelling, I don’t plan to change my investing strategy right now. In fact, I haven’t looked at my 401(k) since the markets began to skid in reaction to Trump’s tariffs.""Some things are better left unseen, the adviser wrote. ""If you have a good long-term investment plan and you’re years away from having to tap your retirement funds, don’t keep checking on how the daily stock swings are affecting your retirement account.""Fox News' Jeanine Pirro urged the audience Thursday to ignore the pain for the ""sake of patriotic dedication to the president"". “I don't really care about my 401k today. You know why?... I believe in this man,” Pirro said. “Who’s complaining? Wall Street. Too bad, he’s helping the middle class. I think it’s gonna be over this summer.”Social media users flagged that Fox apparently removed the stock market ticker for the first time in 28 years. Fox dismissed the claim and said Fox never deploys the stock ticker full-time. “These claims on social media that this is the first time in 28 years the ticker has come down are not accurate.

Recession fears mount as US China tariffs fuel trade war havoc across global markets,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/recession-fears-mount-as-us-china-tariffs-fuel-trade-war-havoc-across-global-markets/articleshow/119988092.cms,"AI generated image

Tech stock hit hard for second day

Recession fears

Uncertainty looms

Stock markets worldwide continued their decline on Friday after China retaliated against President Donald Trump ’s latest round of tariffs, increasing concerns that the escalating trade war could push both the US and global economies into a recession The Dow Jones Industrial Average plummeted more than 1,600 points, or 4%, following a steep 1,679-point drop the previous day. The S&P 500 also slid by 5%, now down more than 15% from its recent peak. The Nasdaq Composite, home to many tech companies with significant business in China, fell by 4%, marking a near bear market as it hovered 21% below its December record close, according to AP.The sell-off on Wall Street intensified Friday after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell cautioned that the Trump administration's tariffs are likely to drive up inflation and hamper economic growth.On Friday, China’s Ministry of Commerce confirmed it would impose a 34% tariff on all US imports starting on April 10, directly matching the US move to raise tariffs on Chinese goods. This retaliation has exacerbated fears of a prolonged trade war between the world’s two largest economies, shaking confidence in global markets.The technology sector was hit especially hard, with Apple, Nvidia, and Tesla among the largest losers. Apple’s stock dropped over 4%, contributing to a 10% loss for the week. Nvidia saw a 7% pullback, while Tesla fell by 9%. These companies, which have substantial manufacturing and sales operations in China, are particularly vulnerable to Beijing’s retaliatory measures.JPMorgan now estimates a 60% chance of a recession in 2025, up from 40% before the tariffs were imposed, as reported CNBC. Bruce Kasman, head of global economic research at JPMorgan, warned, ""If sustained, these policies would likely push the US and possibly the global economy into recession this year.""However, these projections are still evolving, with details about both the US tariff strategy and China’s response yet to fully emerge. Kasman’s note was published before China’s retaliation was officially announced. Despite a better-than-expected US jobs report, which showed accelerated hiring in March, markets remained on edge due to the long-term risks posed by the trade conflict.“The world has changed, and the economic conditions have changed,” said Rick Rieder, Chief Investment Officer of Global Fixed Income at BlackRock.Many investors are now wondering whether this trade war will lead to a global recession. If that happens, stock prices could continue their downward trajectory. The S&P 500 has already lost about 16% from its all-time high in February, and many analysts predict more declines in the near future. Much of the uncertainty revolves around how long the tariffs will last and how other countries will react. Some Wall Street experts are hopeful that Trump might eventually negotiate down the tariffs after securing trade concessions from other nations, while others fear the trade war could drag on for months—or even years—with severe consequences for the global economy.President Trump has acknowledged that US consumers might face ""some pain"" due to the tariffs but argued that the long-term benefits—such as bringing more manufacturing jobs back to the US—would justify the short-term costs. He likened the economic situation to a medical operation, suggesting that, while painful, the US economy, like a patient, would ultimately benefit from the procedure.“For investors looking at their portfolios, it could have felt like an operation performed without anesthesia,” said Brian Jacobsen, Chief Economist at Annex Wealth Management.The former CEO of Goldman Sachs, Lloyd Blankfein, proposed that President Trump allow countries to negotiate the tariffs in a more flexible manner as reported CNBC. Blankfein suggested keeping the 10% baseline tariff but delaying the implementation of the ""reciprocal"" tariffs for six months, giving countries the opportunity to negotiate and avoid further escalation.Meanwhile, the global market turmoil deepened as European stocks also faced steep losses. Major European indexes dropped about 5%, reflecting investor fears over the impact of the trade war. Crude oil prices tumbled to their lowest level since 2021, and copper, an important indicator of global economic health, saw significant declines, signalling growing concerns about a worldwide economic slowdown.The markets showed brief signs of recovery earlier in the day after the US reported stronger-than-expected job growth, with employers adding more jobs than anticipated in March. However, this positive data quickly lost steam as investors turned their focus back to the longer-term economic risks posed by the trade conflict.","The Dow Jones Industrial Average plummeted more than 1,600 points, or 4%, following a steep 1,679-point drop the previous day.

Wall Street plunge pushes ‘fear gauge’ to 8-month high after Trump's tariff sparks trade war with China,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/wall-street-plunge-pushes-fear-gauge-to-8-month-high-after-trumps-tariff-sparks-trade-war-with-china/articleshow/119984617.cms,"Image used for representative purposes

Wall Street's top 'fear gauge' soared to an eight-month high on Friday as US stocks tumbled sharply after China imposed sweeping new tariffs on all US goods. This latest escalation in the trade war between the world's two largest economies rattled global markets, deepening investor anxiety and fueling fears of an impending recession.The Cboe Volatility Index (.VIX), an options-based measure of stock investors' anxiety, spiked as much as 15.54 points to 45.56, its highest level since August. It later settled at 38.27, still up 8.25 points on the day. Historically, a VIX reading above 40 signals heightened fear and market stress, often indicative of systemic risks spreading across asset classes, as reported by Reuters.""A VIX at 40 is a sign of fear for sure,"" said Joe Tigay, portfolio manager for Rational Equity Armor Fund. ""Usually, you see a 40 when there's something more than the usual sell-off ... some sort of credit risk, margin risk, something that could cause a contagion that could spill over and across to other asset classes.""Not just US, markets worldwide were rattled by China’s swift retaliation to President Donald Trump's latest tariffs. Beijing announced a 34% tariff on all US imports, effective April 10, directly responding to Washington's decision to impose similar duties on Chinese goods. The move accelerated losses across global stock markets, with European indices suffering some of the day’s worst declines. Germany’s DAX plunged 4.6%, France’s CAC 40 dropped 4.1%, and Japan’s Nikkei 225 fell 2.8%.The S&P 500 fell 3.5% in morning trading, deepening its year-to-date decline to about 15% and marking its worst day since the Covid-induced market crash of 2020. The Dow Jones Industrial Average plummeted 1,226 points, or 3%, while the Nasdaq Composite slid 3.4%. Stocks of companies with significant exposure to China were among the hardest hit. DuPont, facing a new Chinese antitrust investigation, plunged 14.5%. GE Healthcare, which derives 12% of its revenue from China, tumbled 13.3%. United Airlines, heavily reliant on trans-Pacific travel, dropped 11.7%.The trade war’s impact was also felt in the commodity and bond markets. Crude oil prices fell to their lowest level since 2021, while copper and other industrial metals declined on concerns about slowing global growth. Meanwhile, the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury bond slid to 3.92% from 4.06% the previous day, reflecting growing expectations that the Federal Reserve may cut interest rates to mitigate economic damage. However, with inflation concerns mounting due to tariffs, the Fed’s ability to act remains constrained.Despite a better-than-expected US jobs report showing strong hiring in March, the markets largely shrugged off the news, focusing instead on the broader economic uncertainties. ""The world has changed, and the economic conditions have changed,"" said Rick Rieder, chief investment officer of global fixed income at BlackRock.Trump, for his part, dismissed China’s actions as a miscalculation. Posting on his Truth Social platform in all-caps, he wrote, ""CHINA PLAYED IT WRONG, THEY PANICKED - THE ONE THING THEY CANNOT AFFORD TO DO!""The US president has maintained that the tariffs, though painful in the short term, are necessary to bring manufacturing jobs back to the United States.Looking ahead, much depends on whether the tariffs remain in place and how long the trade standoff lasts. Some analysts hold out hope that Trump will negotiate lower tariffs after securing key concessions. ""The speed of recovery will depend on how, and how quickly, officials negotiate,"" said Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management.Meanwhile, international players like Vietnam and the European Union have signaled their intent to negotiate with the US to avoid further economic disruption. Israel has already eliminated customs duties on all US imports, expanding the free trade agreement and potentially reducing living costs.As the markets go through the turmoil, investors are bracing for more volatility as the markets grapple with uncertainty over trade policy, interest rates, and global economic growth.","The Cboe Volatility Index, an options-based measure of stock investors' anxiety, spiked as much as 15.54 points to 45.56, its highest level since August.

What critical mineral exports is China limiting amid tariff war with US?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/what-critical-mineral-exports-is-china-limiting-amid-tariff-war-with-us/articleshow/119985315.cms,"Representative image (AP)

Rare Earths and permanent magnets



Earlier curbs on five strategic metals



Battery and gallium processing



Outright ban on antimony, gallium, and germanium to US



Rare Earth magnet technology also off-limits



Global response likely to accelerate



Control over producing and refining



As a countermeasure to US tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump , China has expanded its sweeping export restrictions on strategic minerals critical to defence, clean energy, and high-tech industries.The latest development brings out Beijing's growing willingness to weaponize its dominace over global mineral supply chains.On Friday, China placed seven categories of medium and heavy rare earth elements under export control, including samarium, gadolinium, terbium, dysprosium, lutetium, scandium, and yttrium-related items.According to the Reuters, these minerals are essential for producing high-performance permanent magnets used in defence systems, electric vehicles, and clean energy technologies.Also read: China escalates trade war, imposes 34% duty on US imports after Trump's tariffs; files lawsuit with WTO “Full-blown export restrictions on high-performance rare earth magnets containing dysprosium and/or terbium will hit foreign industries and defence sectors hard,” said Ryan Castilloux, founder of Adamas Intelligence. “Importers are holding their breath—no one knows where the cannons are aimed.”China produces about 90% of the world’s refined rare earths, and the US is heavily reliant on Chinese imports.In February, shortly after the US imposed its first 10% tariff on Chinese goods, Beijing introduced export licensing requirements for tungsten, tellurium, bismuth, indium, and molybdenum. These metals are vital for electronics, clean energy, and defence technologies .The restrictions stop short of outright bans but are narrowly targeted. Some products, such as molybdenum, remain exportable under specific conditions.In January, China proposed restrictions on the export of advanced battery and mineral processing technologies, including those used to refine lithium and gallium. These proposals, still pending final approval, signal China’s intent to curb foreign access to critical know-how.One Chinese company reportedly ceased exports of affected products soon after the proposal surfaced.In December, China banned exports of antimony, gallium, and germanium to the US, in response to Washington’s tightening restrictions on China’s semiconductor sector. Though officially limited to the US, the move has disrupted global markets.Despite export license regimes introduced earlier, shipments to major buyers like Japan, India, and South Korea were slow to resume. China mines or refines between 50% and 90% of global supply of these critical materials.Also in December 2023, China expanded its technology export ban to cover the production of rare earth magnets, building on previous restrictions on separation and refining technologies.The decision impacts all countries, further specifies China’s leverage over the critical minerals sector.Friday’s announcement—part of a broader retaliation against the US raising tariffs on most Chinese goods to 54%—is expected to galvanise efforts in the West to diversify supply chains.“This will cause European companies and governments to also think: what’s the risk of export controls hitting us next?” said Jacob Gunter of the Mercator Institute for China Studies.According to Canada-based Mining.com, heavy rare earth elements (HREEs) are of particular concern. “There is currently only one HREE-focused operation outside of China, Myanmar, and Laos,” mentioned David Merriman of Project Blue. Even that mine, Serra Verde in Brazil, currently ships its output to China for processing.China controls the mining, refining, and export quotas for many strategic minerals. While rare earths are abundant in the earth’s crust, the refining process is complex and environmentally hazardous—an area where China has secured dominance.Beijing’s ability to throttle supply via licensing, rather than outright bans, allows it to flex its muscle without completely cutting off trade—a tactic that keeps global markets in suspense.","China has expanded its sweeping export restrictions on strategic minerals critical to defence, clean energy, and high-tech industries.

reciprocal tariffs

?

What’s going to cost more? (Spoiler: everything)

Phones, laptops, batteries

Food

Clothing

Cars and meds

Why is Trump doing this now (again)?

Reshoring jobs: Make America Manufacture Again.

Paying for tax cuts: Because nothing says fiscal responsibility like burning down global supply chains.

Punishing “unfair” countries: For crimes ranging from currency manipulation to being generally annoying.

How are the markets taking it?

Dow futures dropped 2.2% faster than a billionaire fleeing a tax audit.

Wait, can he even do this?

What does this mean for you, the humble avocado-eating consumer?

Picture this: you’re at the grocery store, reaching for your usual $3 avocado, only to find it now costs $4.50. You look around for answers — inflation? Greedy grocers? Nope. It’s a global trade war . Welcome to Trump’s America, Round Two: Tariffs Edition.On Wednesday, President Donald Trump stood in the Rose Garden, squinting into the sun and declaring a “Declaration of Economic Independence.” Translation: a massive tax on nearly everything Americans buy, cleverly disguised as patriotic defiance. The headliner? A 10 percent tariff on all imports, plus extra tariffs — up to a spicy 50 percent — for countries he doesn’t particularly like this week.If you’re confused, broke, or both, don’t worry. We’ve got answers.In theory, a reciprocal tariff is simple: You tax our jeans, we tax your cheese. Eye for an eye, Levi’s for Camembert. But Trump’s version doesn’t just reciprocate — it escalates.Some countries now face import taxes so high, they’ll need therapy. China gets hit with a combined 54 percent. Vietnam? 46 percent. Lesotho — which, fun fact, makes your favorite T-shirts — now faces a 50 percent tariff, possibly because Trump once claimed no one’s heard of it.And yes, even uninhabited territories like Heard Island and McDonald Islands now face tariffs. Just in case their penguins try anything funny.If it crosses a border and ends up in your house, it’s probably more expensive now.— a 10 percent tariff means your next tech upgrade just became a luxury purchase.— the US doesn’t grow avocados, coffee, or bananas in any meaningful quantity. But sure, let’s tax those too.— 98 percent of shoes and a huge chunk of apparel are imported. Hope you like flip-flops from 2007.— already targeted in earlier rounds, now due for an encore.Even remote islands full of puffins and volcanic rock are getting caught in the crossfire. No product is too small, no nation too obscure. It’s tariffs for all — and all for tariffs.The official reasons are patriotic and vaguely math-adjacent:But let’s be honest — it’s 2025, Trump’s back in campaign mode, and nothing plays better to the base than sticking it to foreigners while waving a flag.Plus, tariffs are like reality TV for economists. There’s drama, unintended consequences, and absolutely no one is in control.About as well as you’d expect when someone announces they’re lighting money on fire.S&P and Nasdaq fell harder than your uncle at Thanksgiving after his third bourbon. Asian markets panicked, because unlike us, they’ve read history books. Economists warn that tariffs now cover more than 10 percent of US GDP, compared to just 1.8 percent under Trump’s first round of trade shenanigans. Goldman Sachs now puts the chance of a recession at 35 percent, which is roughly the same odds as Trump appointing a Cabinet member who hasn’t been subpoenaed.Yes. Sort of. Technically. Trump invoked a dusty old 1977 law that gives the president sweeping trade powers during a national emergency — and he’s declared that America’s trade deficit is one. (Yes, really.) Courts have historically waved this stuff through like TSA agents with five minutes left on their shift, so don’t expect judicial intervention anytime soon.Prepare to be the financial cannon fodder in Trump’s tariff crusade.Prices will rise, slowly but surely.Your retirement fund may wobble, depending on how bad the markets get spooked.Your boss may “reevaluate staffing” if your company relies on imports or exports.Domestic alternatives may not exist — unless you’re fine with eating Idaho-grown bananas.So what can you do? Not much — except maybe buy in bulk, diversify your investments, and brush up on how to make your own shoes. Just in case.Trump says this is economic independence. Economists say it’s economic indigestion. But one thing’s for sure:Tariffs are back. Bigger. Bolder. And dumber than ever. Hope you packed lunch. Just don’t expect avocados.","President Donald Trump announced a 10 percent tariff on all imports, plus extra tariffs — up to a spicy 50 percent — for countries he doesn’t particularly like.

Global markets shaken up

The combined wealth of the world's 500 wealthiest individuals decreased by $208 billion on Thursday following US President Donald Trump's announcement of broad tariffs, causing global markets to decline sharply.This represents the fourth-largest single-day reduction in the Bloomberg Billionaires Index since its inception 13 years ago, surpassed only by declines during the peak of the Covid-19 crisis.The wealth index showed that over 50 per cent of tracked billionaires experienced financial losses , with an average decrease of 3.3%. American billionaires were particularly affected, with Meta Platforms Inc.'s Mark Zuckerberg and Amazon Inc.'s Jeff Bezos experiencing significant losses.Carlos Slim of Mexico was amongst the few non-US billionaires who remained unaffected by the tariffs. Meanwhile, the Mexican Bolsa increased by 0.5% after Mexico's exclusion from reciprocal tariff targets, increasing Slim's net worth by approximately 4% to $85.5 billion. The Middle East remained the sole region where Bloomberg-tracked billionaires recorded positive gains.Global stock markets plunged as investors reacted to US President Donald Trump’s latest tariffs and China’s retaliatory measures. Wall Street faced heavy losses, with S&P 500 futures down 3.6%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average falling 3.4% below 40,000, and Nasdaq futures tumbling 4%. Thursday had already seen the worst U.S. market decline in five years, with losses between 4% and 6%.European markets fared even worse—Germany’s DAX dropped 5%, France’s CAC 40 fell 4.2%, and Britain’s FTSE 100 lost 3.8%. Asian markets were hit as well, with Japan’s Nikkei 225 down 2.8% and South Korea’s Kospi falling 0.9%.Major companies exposed to China’s tariffs suffered sharp premarket declines, including Boeing (-6%) and Deere & Co. (-4.7%). Tech stocks were also hit hard, with Apple down 4.7%. Energy stocks slumped as oil prices plummeted 8%, bringing U.S. crude to its lowest level since 2021. Exxon Mobil and Chevron both lost around 4%.China’s response included a 34% tariff on U.S. imports and tighter export controls on rare earths. This escalation has fueled concerns of a global slowdown, with economists warning of a potential 2% hit to US economic growth and inflation nearing 5%.

‘There Will Be Blood’.

Is the world staring at a recession? Economic forecasts have darkened on Wall Street following Donald Trump 's broad tariff announcements, with major financial institutions signalling recession concerns. Bloomberg reports that JPMorgan's Chief Economist Bruce Kasman has elevated global recession probability to 60% for 2025, increasing from 40%. ""The effect of this tax hike is likely to be magnified—through retaliation, a slide in US business sentiment, and supply chain disruptions,"" Kasman wrote in a note titledGoldman Sachs has also increased the recession likelihood to 35% from 20% for the upcoming year. It has reduced its 2025 GDP prediction to 1% and anticipates unemployment reaching 4.5%.

According to Rosenblatt Securities' calculations, if Apple transfers the additional costs to buyers, a premium iPhone model could be priced at approximately $2,300!US tariffs have reached levels that are transforming the global economic outlook , significantly raising US recession risks and constraining the Federal Reserve’s ability to lower interest rates further, Fitch Ratings has said.“Tariff hikes will result in higher consumer prices and lower corporate profits in the US. Higher prices will squeeze real wages, weighing on consumer spending, while lower profits and policy uncertainty will act as a drag on business investment. Upward pressure on goods prices from tariffs – in the context of a recent large jump in US households’ medium-term inflation expectations – means the Fed is likely to become more cautious about further rate cuts in the near term. We expect these effects will likely outweigh the benefits US companies might gain from increased protection against foreign competition,” Fitch has said.Also Read | Wall Street’s $2.4 trillion shock: How Trump’s tariffs rattled global markets- 10 big numbers The University of Michigan's sentiment survey indicates unprecedented levels of Americans expecting rising unemployment since the Great Recession.

Trump defends tariffs, says “markets will boom”



Wall Street suffered its worst day since the 2020 Covid crash as US stocks plummeted on Thursday, shedding more than $2 trillion in market value following President Donald Trump’s sweeping tariffs on foreign imports. The S&P 500 tumbled 4.8%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost over 1,600 points (4%), and the Nasdaq plunged 6%, rattling investor confidence and fueling recession concerns.Economists warned of prolonged economic uncertainty as businesses brace for higher costs and potential retaliatory measures. Retailers, tech firms, banks, and airlines bore the brunt of the selloff, with major companies seeing double-digit declines. “This is a game changer, not only for the US economy but for the global economy,” said Olu Sonola of Fitch Ratings, predicting a high risk of recession.Despite the turmoil, Trump defended his tariffs, claiming they would ultimately strengthen the economy. “The markets are going to boom, the stock is going to boom, the country is going to boom,” he insisted. As investors reeled, Trump attended a LIV Golf event and traveled to Mar-a-Lago, while White House officials scrambled to justify the policy.The selloff impacted nearly every sector. Retailers, tech firms, airlines, and banks were among the worst performers as concerns grew that consumers would cut spending and reduce demand.“Obviously, the tariffs are higher and worse than people expected,” said Tom Cahill of Ventura Wealth Management. “It’s going to take some time to sort out exactly what the effects are going to be, not only on the economy, but also on company earnings.”Consumer spending, which makes up 70% of US economic activity, is expected to slow if companies pass on tariff costs. “If consumers pull back their spending because of higher prices, businesses will produce fewer goods and economic growth could stall or contract,” AP reported.Airlines projected strong profits earlier in the year, but rising costs could deter consumer travel:Most US apparel brands rely on overseas manufacturing:Heavy importers suffered major hits:Global supply chains expose tech firms to tariffs:Concerns about lower borrowing and spending:Reduced discretionary spending hits food chains:Relatively insulated from the tariffs—though still impacted:Meanwhile, as global markets reeled from his sweeping tariffs, US President Donald Trump on Thursday defended the move, claiming it would ultimately strengthen the economy.“I think it’s going very well. It was an operation like what a patient gets operated on, and it’s a big thing,” Trump told reporters. “We have six or seven trillion dollars coming into our country… The markets are going to boom, the stock is going to boom, the country is going to boom.”Despite US stocks suffering their worst day since 2020, Trump remained defiant. On Truth Social, he posted: “ The operation is over! The patient lived and is healing… The patient will be far stronger, bigger, better, and more resilient than ever before. Make America greatagain!""On Wednesday, Donald Trump announced sweeping “Liberation Day” tariffs, including a 10% base duty on most countries, 20% on the EU, 25% on South Korea, and 24% on Japan.Analysts warned of a looming recession and inflation risks. “Here you have a tremendous amount of uncertainty... that’s why the market is heading for a bear market,” said Adam Sarhan of 50 Park Investments.As markets tumbled, Trump attended a LIV Golf tournament before heading to Mar-a-Lago, while White House officials defended the tariffs on news networks.","Wall Street suffered its worst day since the 2020 Covid crash as US stocks plummeted on Thursday, shedding more than $2 trillion in market value.

Technology stocks plunged on Thursday after President Donald Trump’s new tariff policies triggered widespread market panic.Apple led the sharp decline among the ""Magnificent Seven"" tech stocks, dropping nearly 9%. The iPhone maker, which manufactures many of its devices in China and other Asian countries, is on track for its biggest drop since 2020, according to CNBC.The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite fell more than 5%, heading towards its worst performance in over five years. The index has dropped 14% year-to-date.Other major tech companies also felt the impact. Meta Platforms and Amazon both dropped more than 7%, while Nvidia and Tesla slumped over 5%. Nvidia, which builds its chips in Taiwan and assembles artificial intelligence systems in Mexico, was especially hard-hit. Microsoft and Alphabet each fell around 2%.Semiconductor stocks suffered as well, with Marvell Technology, Arm Holdings, and Micron Technology falling over 8%. Broadcom and Lam Research dropped 6%, while Advanced Micro Devices fell more than 4%. Personal computer makers Dell and HP saw significant losses, with both stocks falling over 16%.The sell-off in tech stocks was part of a broader market downturn triggered by fears of a global trade war after Trump unveiled a blanket 10% tariff on all imported goods, along with higher duties targeting specific countries. The new tariffs were described by Trump as a “declaration of economic independence” for the U.S.The tariff measures include a 34% tax on China, in addition to a previous 20% levy, a 46% duty on imports from Vietnam, and a 20% tariff on goods from the European Union. In response, China’s Ministry of Commerce called for the immediate cancellation of the tariffs and warned of “resolute counter-measures.”The tariffs came at a difficult time for the tech-heavy Nasdaq, which had already experienced a tough quarter, with concerns about a weakening U.S. economy weighing on stocks. Trump, however, applauded some of the biggest tech companies for investing in the U.S., highlighting Apple’s plan to spend $500 billion over the next four years.","The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite fell more than 5%, heading towards its worst performance in over five years.

The US stock market plunged sharply on Thursday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropping 1,400 points, or 3.3%, amid widespread concerns triggered by President Donald Trump ’s latest set of severe tariffs.According to news agency AP, the S&P 500 fell 4%, while the Nasdaq Composite dropped 5.1%, reflecting a broader global market sell-off. At one point in the morning, the S&P 500 was on track for its worst day since the COVID-19 pandemic began in 2020.The announcement of new tariffs on imports, including a 10% baseline tax on a range of products, caused significant alarm among investors, fuelling fears of rising inflation and slowing economic growth. The impact was felt globally, with major stock indexes in Europe and Asia also suffering sharp losses.The tariffs have rattled markets, with commodities like crude oil, tech stocks, and even gold—all traditionally seen as safe havens—declining in value. The Russell 2000 index of smaller US companies dropped 5.9%, dipping more than 20% below its record.Trump’s new tariffs include heightened taxes on imports from countries like China and those in the European Union . Economists warn that the tariffs could lower US economic growth by as much as 2 percentage points this year and push inflation close to 5%, potentially dragging the economy into a recession ""Markets may actually be underreacting, especially if these rates turn out to be final, given the potential knock-on effects to global consumption and trade,"" said Sean Sun, portfolio manager at Thornburg Investment Management.The Federal Reserve faces a challenging dilemma. While it may consider cutting interest rates to stimulate the economy, such moves could further fuel inflation. The yield on the 10-year US Treasury note dropped to 4.04% from 4.20% late Wednesday, reflecting growing concerns about the economy’s future.Despite the ongoing economic growth, data released Thursday showed signs of strain. Unemployment claims remained lower than expected, suggesting a stable labour market, but weaker-than-anticipated growth in US service industries highlighted the broader effects of the tariffs. Businesses reported supply chain disruptions, higher costs for materials like aluminium, and delays in deliveries.Corporate stocks took a major hit, with retailers and airlines among the worst affected. Best Buy dropped 15.2%, United Airlines lost 12.3%, and Target fell 10.3%, as investors grew worried about the impact of the tariffs on consumer spending and business activity.Internationally, European and Asian markets followed suit. France's CAC 40 dropped 3.3%, Germany's DAX lost 3%, Japan’s Nikkei 225 fell 2.8%, and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng dropped 1.5%. South Korea's Kospi also lost 0.8%.","US stock market plunged sharply on Thursday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropping 1,400 points, or 3.3%.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume.

Seven trillion USD economy size by 2030 is possible if India maintains its present growth trajectory, and in that journey startup entrepreneurs are going to play an important role,"" he is quoted as having said in the release.He was of the view that the active participation of startups in India in developing business models on the foundation of expanding physical and digital infrastructure will continue to generate efficiency, revenue and economic returns for the country.""The last decade has seen an exceptional transformation in the startup landscape in India, which has emerged as the third largest ecosystem globally, with over 1.12 lakh startups presently recognised by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) across 763 districts.""Among them, more than 110 are unicorns with a total valuation of around USD 350 billion,"" he said.The CEA further said that the country ranks second in innovation quality.He said that innovation in India was not just limited to certain sectors as startups were solving problems in 56 industrial sectors, with 13 per cent of them from IT services, nine per cent from health and life sciences, seven per cent from education, five per cent from agriculture and five per cent from food and beverages.Nageswaran also said it was significant that 49 per cent of the startups were from tier-2 and 3 cities which have turned to be game-changers as the business advantages in these locations enable entrepreneurs to operate at lower costs as compared to tier-1 cities.""Apart from improved infrastructure and the government's pro-active policies, the availability of a technically skilled talent pool is a huge advantage for startups to set up and flourish in tier-2 and tier-3 cities,"" he said.He said that historically there was a perception that small towns were difficult places to conduct business.""...but with improved internet penetration, vastly better physical infrastructure, road, rail and air connectivity and supportive government policies, this is no longer true,"" he said.He also noted Kerala's startup journey has been an inspiring one.The CEA said that KSUM has served as the catalyst since its establishment in 2006 to promote change that propelled the state into the forefront of the global startup arena.KSUM is the Kerala government's nodal agency established in 2006 for entrepreneurship development and incubation activities in the state.Nageswaran said that with over 4,000 registered tech startups, 63 incubators and 10 lakh square feet of incubation space, KSUM has not only met its goal of promoting technology-based entrepreneurship but has also earned the distinguished position of being among the world's top business incubators.The November 16-18 fifth edition of Huddle Global, India's biggest beachside startup conclave, was organised by KSUM at Adimalathura beach, near Vizhinjam, here.Attended by around 1,500 delegates, the event displayed sophisticated products from emerging sectors such as robotics, Artificial Intelligence , Machine Learning, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, life sciences, space tech, blockchain, IoT, e-governance, fintech, healthtech, agritech, edutech and SaaS from across the country.","Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran said tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country.

E-Commerce startup Udaan to trim costs ahead of 2025 IPO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/e-commerce-startup-udaan-to-trim-costs-ahead-of-2025-ipo/articleshow/105001132.cms,"E-commerce startup Udaan is working to curb costs and forge new partnerships with consumer brands in India as it prepares to go public in 2025.Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta said in an interview. That’s set to happen around the same time as its initial public offering, he said.The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said. “Second, strategically we want to ensure that we are top of mind with shopkeepers, with big manufacturers, and we maintain our relative market share.”Lightspeed Venture Partners-backed Udaan is among startups trying to tap the rapid growth of India’s economy and consumer market, while meeting investor demands for profitability. Udaan, which at its peak employed thousands, joined fellow Indian startups in slashing jobs last year and tightening internal controls and compliance. It now has about 1,800 staff, and Gupta didn’t specify if further job cuts are needed.Corporate governance lapses at Indian online tutoring firm Byju’s, once the country’s top startup with a valuation of $22 billion, shone a light at unique challenges faced by founders in the South Asian nation and drove companies to be more diligent.“We continue to move towards more professionalized management, professionalized board and also institutionalized shareholders as we go towards public markets,” Gupta said.Udaan is yet to decide whether it will list in India or overseas. It was valued at more than $3 billion in a 2021 funding round, and was in talks to raise $400 million, Business Standard reported in September. Lightspeed owns about 35% of Udaan, while Tencent Holdings Ltd. holds 6%.The company was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran Udaan until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021. The other two founders — Amod Malviya and Sujeet Kumar — are board members.Udaan built an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business still accounts for a very small part of India’s overall retail market but can balloon to $150 billion in sales and yield a 100% return on capital invested in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co. estimates published in the Mint newspaper.Bengaluru-based Udaan has also ventured into financing through its fintech unit which helps shopkeepers get working capital loans to buy inventory. That business is profitable before taxes and is growing 70% annually, Gupta said.“That’s a second business in the overall umbrella of Udaan trying to organize trade in the country,” Gupta said. “In addition to commerce, financing becomes an important market opportunity.”","Udaan will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta says.

Space sector start-up Sisir Radar to develop SAR on L/P band SAR,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/space-sector-start-up-sisir-radar-to-develop-sar-on-l/p-band-sar/articleshow/104558111.cms,"CHENNAI: Space sector startup, Sisir Radar Private Ltd has hit success at the prestigious iDEX DefSpace Challenge with its projects for development of “L/P band Continuous Wave SAR (synthetic aperture radar) payload for LEO Small Satellites” and “Unfurlable, Electronically Steering Antenna for L/P band SAR payload” for Indian Air Force (IAF), said a top company official.The company is promoted by former Director at the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) Tapan Misra and the brains behind the Indian space agency’s RISAT series of SAR satellites as well as the Dual Frequency SAR on the Chandrayaan 2 orbiter that is currently circling the moon.""A grant of Rs 3 crore is also there for development of the products,"" Misra told IANS.Synthetic Aperture Radar or SAR is a special kind of imaging radar technology that can provide extremely accurate high resolution imagery of the terrain through clouds, smoke and dust even in pitch dark conditions. SAR imagery provides much higher resolution than other forms of remote sensing technology such as hyperspectral and multispectral. SAR is a critical technology for strategic reconnaissance and planning as well as for disaster management.According to Misra, winning the challenge in just over a year of floating the company is a major booster.He said L and P band SAR have an advantage over other frequencies (like X band) when it comes to penetration capabilities through rain, clouds, foliage and vegetation in a tropical country like India, and underground penetration capabilities in dry terrain.Continuing further, he said the L band SAR will provide 1 metre resolution, spotlight resolution in Stripmap mode. The current industry standard is 5-10 metre in L band. Misra said both the L and P band will operate simultaneously from a satellite borne SAR. Recently, Sisir Radar successfully developed and tested the world’s highest resolution L-Band SAR fitted on a drone. With 0.2 metre resolution, this is by far the highest L band SAR in the world, he said.","Space sector startup, Sisir Radar Private Ltd has hit success at the prestigious iDEX DefSpace Challenge.

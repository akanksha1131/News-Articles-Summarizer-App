India Offered to Scrap All Tariffs on US Goods, Claims Trump | Warns Apple Not to Make in India

The US rejecting mango consignments from India has led to exporters destroying the fruits resulting in big losses , and Indian authorities have alleged that America did not follow the standard procedure. After Indian authorities faced rejection of 15 mango consignments by the US due to procedural issues, they have said that US inspectors failed to adhere to the established protocol.Various mango varieties, such as Alphonso, Kesar, Banganapalli and Himayat, have gained access to the US market. Additionally, northern Indian varieties including Raspuri, Langra, Chausa, and Dasheri are successfully undergoing irradiation treatment for export purposes.The value of Indian mango exports to the United States has shown significant growth, increasing by 130% to $10 million in FY24, compared to $4.36 million in 2022-23.aharashtra State Agricultural Marketing Board (MSAMB), a government organisation operating an irradiation facility in Mumbai, issued a statement on Tuesday stating: ""Instead of discussing the matter with relevant agencies or notifying the facility beforehand, they (the inspectors) directly reported the alleged issues to their senior offices in the US, resulting in the rejection of the 15 consignments.""Also Read | Forced to destroy!

First quarterly loss for IndusInd Bank in 19 years,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/first-quarterly-loss-for-indusind-bank-in-19-years/articleshow/121324539.cms,"MUMBAI: IndusInd Bank reported a quarterly loss of Rs 2,236 crore for the three months ending March 2025, reversing a net profit of Rs 2,346 crore in the same period a year earlier. It was the bank's first quarterly loss since March 2006.This disclosure follows the abrupt exits of its chief executive and his deputy last month after the bank unearthed widespread irregularities in its foreign exchange derivatives and microfinance portfolio. The bank managed to record a profit of Rs 2,642 crore for FY25, which was 70% lower than Rs 8,950 crore in the previous year.In filings to the stock exchange, the bank said internal and external reviews uncovered a fresh fraud where Rs 172.6 crore was wrongly booked as fee income in its microfinance arm. Broader discrepancies spanned derivative trades, income recognition, and the classification of assets and liabilities. The board now suspects fraud involving senior employees and has said it will file complaints with enforcement agencies.Sunil Mehta, the bank's chairman, told analysts that the accounting of internal derivatives was discontinued from April 2024, following confirmation of irregularities by external reviewers.Additional audits found income was misclassified, loans wrongly categorized-leading to an under-provisioning of Rs 1,885 crore-and balances in ""other assets"" and ""other liabilities"" lacked substantiation. The bank also misbooked Rs 760 crore of interest income that should have been recorded elsewhere.Mehta said that the board will ""do whatever needs to be done and follow the due process of law without fear or favour to ensure accountability"". He said that all issues were duly identified, duly addressed, and declared with stakeholders, and the new CEO would be starting with a fresh slate.The statutory audit for FY25, conducted by MSK & Associates and Chokshi & Chokshi, reveals a damning litany of past lapses. Among the more serious findings was a write-off of Rs 1,960 crore in ""accumulated notional profits"" since FY2016 arising from internal trades, termed by the auditors a ""prior period item."" They also flagged the reversal of cumulative interest and fee income worth Rs 846.4 crore recorded during the year.Auditors highlighted manual entries dating back several years that were netted off in the current year, amounting to Rs 595 crore. More seriously, they pointed out glaring lapses by former key management personnel.","IndusInd Bank reported a quarterly loss of Rs 2,236 crore for the three months ending March 2025.

"CCPA notice to Uber over ‘advance tip’ feature for faster service, more under scanner",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/ccpa-notice-to-uber-over-advance-tip-feature-for-faster-service-more-under-scanner/articleshow/121323913.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Central Consumer Protection Authority has issued notice to ride hailing platform Uber over its ‘advance tip’ feature in its app for availing faster service, calling it an unethical and unfair trade practice . The authority is also looking into similar practices by other platforms such as Rapido and Ola, sources said.Announcing the authority’s action following complaints from users, consumer affairs minister Pralhad Joshi on Wednesday said on X, “The practice of ‘advance tip’ is deeply concerning. Forcing or nudging users to pay a tip in advance for faster service is unethical and exploitative. Such actions fall under unfair trade practices. Tip is given as a token of appreciation not as a matter of right, after the service.” The CCPA has asked Uber to respond to the notice within 15 days.Consumer affairs secretary and CCPA chief commissioner Nidhi Khare told TOI that such practice leads to “exploiting consumer choice”. She added, “This is unfair trade practice and manipulating customer choice. We are keeping an eye on other platforms in this sector that have such features.”Joshi said tips should be a voluntary gesture of appreciation given after delivery of service, not something paid upfront.“Fairness, transparency and accountability must be upheld in all customer interactions,” the minister said.Though Uber had announced the new feature of “upfront tipping” in its app in Nov 2024 to allow riders to “add a tip before a trip, encouraging faster matches and boosting driver earnings, especially during peak hours”, it was introduced a month back. The ride hailing app claims that “a driver may be more likely to accept this ride, if you add a tip. Your driver receives 100% of the tip. If you add a tip now, you can’t change it later”.There was no response from Uber on the CCPA action.Industry sources said the practice has become an industry norm and “upfront tipping” is offered in different ways. One of the ride-hailing platforms introduced this in 2023 and another bike and taxi aggregator has been doing this for over a year.","The Central Consumer Protection Authority has issued notice to ride hailing platform Uber over its ‘advance tip’ feature in its app for availing faster service.

Always consult with a qualified investment advisor or financial planner before making any investment decisions.

BNP Paribas India has retained its outperform rating on Dixon Technologies with the target price at 17,910. Analysts said the company delivered a remarkable FY25 with revenues more than doubling while maintaining balance-sheet strength, high fixed-asset turnover, high return on equity and strong operating cash flow generation. While Dixon continues to inch towards capturing a large part of the domestic mobile-phone total addressable market and the bigger export opportunity, it is evaluating partnerships for non-semiconductor components, apart from display manufacturing They expect such forays to ensure customer stickiness and boost the company’s margin profile, offsetting the impact of the discontinuation of the mobile PLI scheme by the govt.Elara Securities India has an accumulate rating on Bharat Electronics with the price at Rs 400. Analysts said the company surprised on the positive in FY25, reaching the highest margins in its history. Its products also demonstrated proven capabilities during the recent India-Pakistan conflict, resulting in export inquiries. Analysts raised the target price due to battle-proven product portfolio, strong order visibility that was further bolstered by export opportunities, along with potential for surprise on margin on the upside.Emkay Global Financial Services has upgraded Hindalco to reduce from sell, and raised the target price to Rs 650 from Rs 600 earlier. Analysts said with major concerns largely priced in and a structurally positive outlook on LME aluminium, a sell rating was no longer warranted. The company posted a strong Q4 with business EBITDA of Rs 9,770 crore, which was above estimates. It was driven by robust aluminium upstream performance on lower input costs and better realization. Hindalco’s strong Jan-March numbers and improved cost outlook, supported by captive coal and lower alumina costs, reinforced its upstream EBITDA-per-tonne growth potential. ICICI Securities has an add rating on ICICI Securities with the target price at Rs 5,450. Analysts said Pfizer’s Jan-March outperformance was driven by a strong beat in EBITDA margins. They said its revenue growth for the quarter was likely driven by key brands such as Prevenar-13, Becosules, Minipress-XL and Mucaine. In Feb’25, Pfizer had out-licensed key CNS brands Ativan and Pacitane for five years to Mylan, which may also have helped Pfizer trim its overhead cost during the quarter. Besides, sale of its Thane land to Zoetis Pharma is expected to further improve its cash balance.Motilal Oswal Financial Services has a neutral rating on Siemens with the target price at Rs 3,200. The company in its analyst meeting highlighted its continued focus on improving margins as volumes improve across segments. Analysts said the company’s smart infrastructure is benefiting from improved demand and the digital industries segment seems to be bottoming out in terms of demand weakness. Its mobility segment volumes will improve as locomotive delivery commences after a few quarters. The company intends to increase the share of exports in both smart infrastructure and mobility.","BNP Paribas India has retained its outperform rating on Dixon Technologies with the target price at 17,910.

New Income tax bill: Get one-time set off of long-term capital loss against short-term capital gains from tax year 2026–27,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/taxation/new-income-tax-bill-get-one-time-set-off-of-long-term-capital-loss-against-short-term-capital-gains-from-tax-year-202627/articleshow/121322440.cms,"What's changing?

Why it matters

Why is this only a one-time relief?

A one-time tax relief proposed under the new Income Tax Bill, 2025 could significantly reduce capital gains tax liabilities for many individual taxpayers. The new Income Tax bill allows long-term capital losses (LTCL) incurred up to March 31, 2026, to be set off against any short-term capital gains (STCG) from tax year 2026–27 onwards. This marks a key departure from the current provisions under the Income Tax Act, 1961, which only allow LTCL to be set off against long-term capital gains (LTCG).The proposed change, found in Clause 536(n) of the new bill, enables broader capital gains tax planning and faster loss absorption.“Under clause 536(n) of the new tax bill, 2025 any capital loss, whether long-term or short-term, computed under the old Income Tax Act, 1961 and brought forward as on 31 March 2026, may be set off and carried forward against ‘income under the head Capital gains’ under the new tax bill 2025. Notably, this provision does not draw a distinction between long-term and short-term capital gains for the purpose of set-off,” said Chartered Accountant Dr Suresh Surana, according to an ET report.Currently, under Section 74 of the Income Tax Act, 1961, long-term capital losses can only be set off against LTCG. This restriction limited the flexibility for taxpayers to manage losses.“Currently, the Income Tax Act, 1961 allows the set-off of brought forward LTCL only against LTCG, limiting taxpayers' flexibility to offset LTCL with STCG,” said Aseem Mowar, Tax Partner at EY India.However, as per the transitional provision in the new Income Tax Bill, this restriction is being eased — but only temporarily — for losses incurred up to March 31, 2026.“The proposed new Income Tax Bill, 2025 continues this restriction for LTCL incurred after April 1, 2026, but the ‘Repeal and Saving’ clause in Section 536 (specifically 536(2)(n)) permits the set-off of LTCL incurred until March 31, 2026, against any capital gains under ITB 2025 for tax years starting on or after April 1, 2026, for up to eight financial years immediately succeeding the financial year in which such loss was first computed under the current Income Tax Act, 1961,” Mowar explained.This one-time relief can significantly reduce tax outgo for individuals who have accumulated LTCL over the years and have struggled to match it with sufficient LTCG.“The transitional provision under Section 536(n)... carries significant implications for taxpayers holding accumulated capital losses, particularly long-term capital losses (LTCL), as on 31 March 2026,” Surana said.“By permitting the set-off of such brought forward losses, whether long-term or short-term, against any form of capital gains... the legislation offers a temporary but meaningful departure from the restrictive loss-set-off rules under the current Income-tax Act, 1961.”It also opens the door for tax planning strategies ahead of FY 2026–27.“Taxpayers can sell investments likely to incur long-term losses before April 1, 2026, allowing them to offset these losses against future short-term capital gains,” Mowar added. “This dispensation, albeit temporary, allows taxpayers to leverage their losses more effectively, reducing overall tax liabilities.”Since the relief falls under the ‘Repeal and Saving’ clause of the new bill, it is designed to offer transitional assistance as the old Income Tax Act, 1961 is replaced.“It is important to note that ‘Repeal and Saving’ clauses are typically included when old legislation is replaced with new one, ensuring that certain rights or obligations under the old law are preserved,” said Mowar.“The majority may argue that this appears to be a well-thought-out dispensation... others may view it as an oversight, as it contradicts established provisions. Thus, it remains to be seen how the provision is ultimately enacted.” he added.","A one-time tax relief proposed under the new Income Tax Bill, 2025 could significantly reduce capital gains tax liabilities for many individual taxpayers.

Germany’s economic outlook dampened by tariffs; growth stalled for 2025: Advisory panel,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/germanys-economic-outlook-dampened-by-tariffs-growth-stalled-for-2025-advisory-panel/articleshow/121320974.cms,"Germany’s economy is expected to stagnate in 2025, according to the country’s panel of independent economic advisers, as global trade tensions and tariffs introduced by US President Donald Trump continue to pose serious headwinds for Europe’s largest economy.In their first forecast since Chancellor Friedrich Merz assumed office on May 6, the panel projected zero growth for the current year, with only 1 per cent growth anticipated in 2026. This marks a downward revision from the earlier prediction of 0.4 per cent growth, made in November under the previous administration.Germany's economy has now shrunk for two consecutive years, and hasn't posted notable growth in five years, AP reported.“Trump's tariff policy is increasing uncertainty and endangering economic growth worldwide,” said Monika Schnitzer, chair of the advisory panel. She noted, however, that a major investment package unveiled by Merz’s coalition government “offers opportunities for a modernization of infrastructure in Germany and a return to a higher path of growth.”Chancellor Merz has vowed to cut red tape, boost digitization, introduce corporate tax incentives, and promote expanded European trade agreements to stimulate economic revival.Germany, once a global export powerhouse in industrial machinery and luxury vehicles, has seen its competitive edge eroded by rising Chinese competition and weakening global demand. The recent tariff impositions by the US have only exacerbated the challenges for German exporters.In a notable shift, the US became Germany’s largest trading partner in 2024, overtaking China for the first time since 2015, as exports to China declined significantly.","Germany's economy has shrunk for two consecutive years, and hasn't posted notable growth in five years.

"IEA warns of growing global dependence on few nations for critical minerals, highlights China’s dominance",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/iea-warns-of-growing-global-dependence-on-few-nations-for-critical-minerals-highlights-chinas-dominance/articleshow/121319416.cms,"The global supply of critical minerals essential for clean energy technologies is becoming increasingly concentrated in a handful of countries, particularly China, posing a significant risk to global economic stability, according to a report released Wednesday by the International Energy Agency ( IEA ).The Paris-based agency’s “Global Critical Minerals Outlook” highlights the strategic vulnerabilities stemming from the limited diversification of key mineral sources—such as copper, lithium, cobalt, graphite, and rare earth elements—which are crucial for manufacturing electric vehicles, batteries, wind turbines, and other clean energy infrastructure.The report found that the market share held by the top three producing countries for these minerals rose to 86 per cent in 2024, up from 82 per cent in 2020. China, in particular, has solidified its position as the world’s leading refiner for 19 of the 20 most critical minerals, with an average global refining share of around 75 per cent. Indonesia has also emerged as a key player in nickel production, driven by its expanding role in stainless steel and battery component manufacturing.“Critical mineral supply chains can be highly vulnerable to supply shocks, be they from extreme weather, a technical failure, or trade disruptions,” said IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol.“The impact of a supply shock can be far-reaching, bringing higher prices for consumers and reducing industrial competitiveness.”Birol pointed to the energy crisis in Europe following Russia’s gas supply cuts and the global chip shortage during the pandemic as recent examples of the devastating effects of supply chain disruptions.“The golden rule of energy security is diversification,” Birol told The Associated Press. “And it goes beyond energy security — it is also economic security.”While markets play an important role in driving investment and innovation, Birol emphasized that government intervention through strategic policies and financing will be necessary to ensure resilience and meet rising global demand.The IEA’s findings arrive amid rising global tensions around trade and resource control. China’s tightened export restrictions on several strategic minerals have escalated concerns among Western nations about supply vulnerability, especially as clean energy goals ramp up.Former US President Donald Trump, now back in office, has prioritized reducing America’s dependence on foreign mineral supplies. His administration recently finalized a controversial deal with Ukraine to access its vast mineral reserves and is actively exploring deep-sea mining, despite environmental opposition.Trump has also issued executive orders to fast-track domestic copper mining, reviewed a minerals agreement with the Democratic Republic of Congo, and attempted to secure mineral supplies from Greenland. These actions are part of his broader agenda to reinforce national security and economic resilience by diversifying supply chains and boosting domestic production.The IEA noted that global critical mineral markets are currently well-supplied, and prices have generally declined. However, it issued a stark warning that planned global copper production is falling behind projected demand, forecasting a 30 per cent supply shortfall by 2030. Copper is vital for electrical grids, renewable energy systems, and infrastructure electrification.The agency stressed the importance of accelerating investment in new mining projects, refining capabilities, and recycling technologies, while also establishing robust trade partnerships and reducing overreliance on any single nation.As the global economy shifts toward clean energy, the need for secure, transparent, and sustainable mineral supply chains will only intensify, the IEA concluded.","The top three producing countries for these minerals rose to 86% in 2024, up from 82% in 2020.

UK inflation hits 3.5% in April amid soaring household bills and tax pressures,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/uk-inflation-hits-3-5-in-april-amid-soaring-household-bills-and-tax-pressures/articleshow/121316034.cms,"Inflation in the UK surged to its highest level since January 2024 in April, driven by sharp increases in domestic bills such as energy and water, official data revealed on Wednesday.The Office for National Statistics reported that the consumer prices index rose to 3.5 per cent in the 12 months to April, up from 2.6 per cent in March — surpassing economists’ expectations of a rise to 3.3 per cent, news agency AP reported.This marks the steepest monthly inflation jump since October 2022, during the height of the global energy crisis following Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.Economists had anticipated a notable rise in April due to substantial annual increases in utility costs, higher business taxes, and a significant boost to the minimum wage.With inflation expected to remain above 3 per cent for the rest of 2025, prospects for additional interest rate cuts by the Bank of England may diminish. The central bank, which targets a 2 per cent inflation rate, has been gradually reducing rates since last August from a 16-year high of 5.25 per cent. Earlier this month, it lowered the main rate to 4.25 per cent.Bank of England chief economist Huw Pill, speaking on Tuesday, expressed concern that borrowing rates may have been cut too swiftly, highlighting persistent underlying inflation pressures.Rob Wood, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said that further rate cuts following a “precise quarterly schedule” are now “far from certain.”Although inflation is set to stay above target this year, economists expect it to ease in 2026, partly due to the recent UK-U.S. trade deal that scrapped several planned tariffs introduced during the Trump administration.The sudden jump in inflation presents a political challenge for the Labour government, which returned to power last July after 14 years. The party has recently emphasized signs of economic progress, including stronger-than-expected Q1 growth and a series of trade deals — not only with the US, but also with India and the European Union.“I am disappointed with these figures, because I know cost of living pressures are still weighing down on working people,"" said Treasury chief Rachel Reeves.The Conservative Party, now in opposition, blamed the inflation spike on Labour’s fiscal policies.“Families are paying the price for the Labour Chancellor’s choices,"" said Mel Stride, the Tories' economy spokesman.","Consumer prices index rose to 3.5% in the 12 months to April, up from 2.6% in March.

How India’s boycott of Turkish products & services may aggravate Turkey’s dire economic state,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/how-indias-boycott-of-turkish-products-services-may-aggravate-turkeys-dire-economic-state/articleshow/121314302.cms,"The widespread boycott call by Indian citizens and businesses on Turkish products and services, which was caused by Turkey's blatant support of Pakistan in the conflict that erupted after Operation Sindoor is expected to aggravate further the dire economic problems faced by ordinary Turks due mainly to rampant inflation and the devaluation of the Turkish Lira.Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who has always supported Pakistan's claims in Kashmir, rportedly supplied more than 350 drones and some military operatives to Pakistan during the conflict.In a message to Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, Erdogan reiterated his support for Pakistan saying, ""As in the past, we will continue to stand by you in good times and bad in the future.""This uncalled-for intervention in a conflict far away from Turkey's borders in which Ankara has absolutely no reason to get involved as well as its attempt to change its outcome, by helping to coordinate Pakistani drone strikes on India, has greatly angered the Indian people and businessmen who decided to stop importing goods and services from Turkey and sever business relations with Turkish traders and manufacturers.Already, major tourist platforms reported a 60 per cent reduction in bookings by Indians in holidays in Turkey and a more than 250 per cent increase in cancellations. As in 2024 this number stood at 3,30,100 visitors, the cancellations could mean dozens of millions in lost revenue.According to Indian Brand Equity Foundation, India's imports from Turkey stood at USD 3.78 billion in 2023-24. Furthermore, the Indian government has cancelled a USD 2.3 billion shipbuilding deal.Also, Turkish Firms like Celebi Aviation that operate ground handling at key airports would be replaced by local or international partners from other countries, while Turkish contractors will be gradually phased out from public works in India.It should be mentioned that according to the United Nations COMTRADE database on international trade in 2024, Turkish exports to Pakistan amounted to USD 918.22 million, and cannot compensate for the loss of exports to India.Undoubtedly, the boycott will deprive Turkey of desperately needed foreign exchange and trade with one of the world's biggest economies and strain its diplomatic ties with India, but it will also affect other important sectors such partnerships between Turkish and Indian universities, like the Jawaharlal Nehru University, Jamia Millia Islamia University and Kota University.There is no doubt that the Turkish economy is facing one of the most serious economic crises in Turkey's recent history, with extremely high inflation, while the Turkish Lira has sunk to unprecedented lows. Ordinary people find it very hard to buy food and pay the skyrocketing rents prevailing in major towns and are becoming increasingly desperate.According to the latest real estate rent index calculated by the OECD based on March results, rental fee inflation in Turkey recorded the highest rate among OECD members reaching 96.25 per cent in the first quarter of this year compared to the previous quarter.Erdogan's misguided economic policies, such as his insistence on keeping interest rates unrealistically low, his public spending spree and his penchant for constructing mega projects- which he always awards to his cronies - as well as his government's disastrous intervention in markets, have depleted the country's foreign exchange reserves and state coffers.The Turkish lira has fallen to a new record low of 38.7 per USD as investors worry about the country's political and economic outlook, while Turkey's Central Bank continues to intervene in the foreign exchange market to stabilize the currency. The sharp depreciation of the Turkish Lira, instead of boosting exports as Erdogan hoped, has only contributed to a loss of real wages and a declining standard of living for the Turkish people.It is noted that last March the Lira fell to a record low of 40 to 1 USD following the arrest on trumped-up charges of Istanbul's popular Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu, President Erdogan's main political rival, who continues to be in jail. The incident triggered the largest protests in Turkey in a decade and raised worries about deepening political instability.Major credit agencies such as Moody's, Fitch and S&P have downgraded Turkey's sovereign debt rating to near junk status, warning of heightened risks of default.As Erdogan's follows unorthodox economic and monetary policies, foreign direct investment (FDI), which used to be a strong pillar of the Turkish economy, has plummeted and foreign firms which in the past considered Turkey as an attractive market are now quite reluctant to invest.According to official figures released by the Turkish Statistical Institute (TUIK) annual consumer price inflation slowed to 38.01 per cent in March 2025, down from a peak of around 75 per cent in May of the previous year. However, independent institutes as well as many citizens believe that in reality, inflation is much higher than that.For the majority of ordinary Turks, as a result of high inflation and the devaluation of the currency, which makes imported goods much more expensive, necessities such as food, fuel and housing have become increasingly unaffordable.Erdogan's insistence on implementing his unorthodox monetary policies and the Indian boycott of Turkish products triggered by Ankara's intervention in the conflict between India and Pakistan will undoubtedly make the life of ordinary Turks much more difficult.",Turkey supplied more than 350 drones and some military operatives to Pakistan during the conflict. Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has always supported Pakistan's claims in Kashmir. India's imports from Turkey stood at USD 3.78 billion in 2023-24.

The world's supply of critical minerals needed for clean energy is becoming more concentrated in a few countries, especially China, raising concerns about economic vulnerability and potential supply disruptions, according to a new report by the International Energy Agency (IEA) released Wednesday.The report analysed the supply of key minerals and metals that, although used in small amounts, are crucial for the shift from fossil fuels to electricity and renewable energy. The research further revealed that for copper, lithium, cobalt, graphite and rare earth elements, the combined market share of the top three producing nations increased to 86% in 2024 from 82% in 2020.China refines 19 out of the 20 key minerals studied in the report, holding about 75% of the global market share. Indonesia has also made strong progress in producing nickel, which is important for making steel and batteries for electric vehicles.The IEA expressed concerns about increasing export limitations and trade conflicts. ""Critical mineral supply chains can be highly vulnerable to supply shocks, be they from extreme weather, a technical failure or trade disruptions,"" the IEA executive director Fatih Birol told The Associated Press.""The impact of a supply shock can be far-reaching, bringing higher prices for consumers and reducing industrial competitiveness,"" Birol noted.Birol further cited Europe's energy crisis following Russia's natural gas supply reduction over the Ukraine conflict. He also mentioned the global silicon-based computer chip shortage during and after the pandemic that affected automobile production.China is a major global supplier of critical minerals used in products like computer chips, electric vehicles, batteries, drones, robots, and military equipment. It also leads in refining and processing key minerals such as lithium, cobalt, and graphite.In recent years, China has tightened export controls on many of these materials, especially during trade tensions with the US under President Donald Trump.These restrictions have made it harder for US industries to find alternative sources, affecting their competitiveness and increasing pressure on global supply chains.Trump has prioritised reducing US reliance on foreign critical minerals as a fundamental component of his first 100 days back in office, as part of national security and economic resilience initiatives.The situation extends beyond China; the Trump administration recently concluded a complex agreement with Ukraine, securing American access to their substantial mineral resources.Trump has pushed for deep-sea mining in international waters, despite opposition from environmental groups. He has also called for expanding the domestic copper industry through a February executive order and urged faster approvals for new mining projects.Trump reviewed a mining proposal from the mineral-rich but conflict-prone Congo and even tried to pressure Greenland into supplying more minerals to the US.Meanwhile, the International Energy Agency (IEA) reported that while global markets currently have adequate mineral supplies and prices are generally down, copper production is not expected to meet future demand. The agency warned of a possible 30% shortfall in copper—vital for electric wiring and power grids—by 2030.","China refines 19 out of the 20 key minerals studied in the report, holding about 75% of the global market share.

Marks & Spencer on Wednesday warned that the recent cyberattack on its online systems will continue disrupting its online services till July and could cost the retailer as much as £300 million.The British high street giant also said that the fallout from the incident may significantly impact its operations and revenue in the coming weeks.“In Fashion, Home & Beauty, online sales and trading profit have been heavily impacted by the necessary decision to pause online shopping, however stores have remained resilient,” the entity said in a statement, quoted by AFP.Last week, the company revealed that the cyberattack stole personal data belonging to some of its customers.The company further added that it anticipated ""online disruption to continue throughout June and into July as we restart, then ramp up operations.""The ransomware attack, which began around Easter, forced M&S to suspend online sales, contactless in-store payments, and even its recruitment systems. The retailer confirmed that compromised data may include names, birthdates, home addresses, and phone numbers — but reassured customers that no “usable” payment or card details, or account passwords, were accessed.Despite the challenges, Marks reported operating profit before adjusting items of £985 million for the financial year ending in March. However, it estimated the impact of the cyberattack on full-year group operating profit would be around £300 million.

NEW DELHI: Elon Musk on Tuesday reaffirmed his commitment to lead Tesla for at least the next five years, addressing investor concerns and political backlash during a video appearance at the Qatar Economic Forum hosted by Bloomberg. His remarks followed a recent trip to Doha as part of US President Donald Trump ’s Middle East delegation.When moderator Mishal Husain asked whether he intended to remain Tesla's chief executive, Musk replied simply, ""Yes."" Pressed further on whether he had any doubts, he quipped: ""I can't be still here if I'm dead.""Tesla has faced mounting scrutiny in recent months following Musk’s collaboration with President Trump’s Department of Government Efficiency, a controversial initiative that oversaw sweeping cuts across the US federal workforce. The association led to a decline in Tesla's sales and share price, as well as violent protests targeting the company's dealerships.Asked about the impact of his political involvement and the backlash against Tesla, Musk responded: “I did what needed to be done. I'm not someone who has ever committed violence and yet massive violence was committed against my companies, massive violence was threatened against me.” Referring to those responsible, he added pointedly, “Don’t worry; we’re coming for you.”Musk also addressed his political contributions , including a reported $250 million toward Trump’s 2024 re-election campaign. “I think I’ve done enough,” he said. “In terms of political spending, I’m going to do a lot less in the future.”The Tesla chief took aim at Delaware Chancellor Kathaleen St. Jude McCormick, who recently blocked his $56 billion Tesla pay package. Musk dismissed her as “an activist who is cosplaying a judge in a Halloween costume.”Despite the legal setback, Musk acknowledged that compensation is part of his consideration to remain with Tesla. However, he underscored that his primary concern is maintaining control of the company's direction. “It’s not a money thing, it’s a reasonable control thing over the future of the company,” he said, “especially if we’re building millions, potentially billions of humanoid robots .”",Elon Musk reaffirmed his commitment to lead Tesla for at least the next five years.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

Startups will play important role in helping India become 3rd largest economy: CEA Nageswaran,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/startups-will-play-important-role-in-helping-india-become-3rd-largest-economy-cea-nageswaran/articleshow/105332523.cms,"Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Startups will play an important role in helping India become the third largest economy in the world, Chief Economic Advisor ( CEA ) to the Union government V Anantha Nageswaran has said.Nageswaran said that tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country due to improvements in infrastructure and supportive policies of the government, according to a KSUM release.The CEA, during his Leadership Talk on the concluding day of the Huddle Global 2023 organised by the Kerala Startup Mission (KSUM), said that India was the fifth largest economy on course to become the third largest in a few years.""In fact, I will say 7-in-7 is the buzz slogan, that is 7 trillion USD economy in seven years. Seven trillion USD economy size by 2030 is possible if India maintains its present growth trajectory, and in that journey startup entrepreneurs are going to play an important role,"" he is quoted as having said in the release.He was of the view that the active participation of startups in India in developing business models on the foundation of expanding physical and digital infrastructure will continue to generate efficiency, revenue and economic returns for the country.""The last decade has seen an exceptional transformation in the startup landscape in India, which has emerged as the third largest ecosystem globally, with over 1.12 lakh startups presently recognised by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) across 763 districts.""Among them, more than 110 are unicorns with a total valuation of around USD 350 billion,"" he said.The CEA further said that the country ranks second in innovation quality.He said that innovation in India was not just limited to certain sectors as startups were solving problems in 56 industrial sectors, with 13 per cent of them from IT services, nine per cent from health and life sciences, seven per cent from education, five per cent from agriculture and five per cent from food and beverages.Nageswaran also said it was significant that 49 per cent of the startups were from tier-2 and 3 cities which have turned to be game-changers as the business advantages in these locations enable entrepreneurs to operate at lower costs as compared to tier-1 cities.""Apart from improved infrastructure and the government's pro-active policies, the availability of a technically skilled talent pool is a huge advantage for startups to set up and flourish in tier-2 and tier-3 cities,"" he said.He said that historically there was a perception that small towns were difficult places to conduct business.""...but with improved internet penetration, vastly better physical infrastructure, road, rail and air connectivity and supportive government policies, this is no longer true,"" he said.He also noted Kerala's startup journey has been an inspiring one.The CEA said that KSUM has served as the catalyst since its establishment in 2006 to promote change that propelled the state into the forefront of the global startup arena.KSUM is the Kerala government's nodal agency established in 2006 for entrepreneurship development and incubation activities in the state.Nageswaran said that with over 4,000 registered tech startups, 63 incubators and 10 lakh square feet of incubation space, KSUM has not only met its goal of promoting technology-based entrepreneurship but has also earned the distinguished position of being among the world's top business incubators.The November 16-18 fifth edition of Huddle Global, India's biggest beachside startup conclave, was organised by KSUM at Adimalathura beach, near Vizhinjam, here.Attended by around 1,500 delegates, the event displayed sophisticated products from emerging sectors such as robotics, Artificial Intelligence , Machine Learning, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, life sciences, space tech, blockchain, IoT, e-governance, fintech, healthtech, agritech, edutech and SaaS from across the country.","Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran said tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country.

E-Commerce startup Udaan to trim costs ahead of 2025 IPO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/e-commerce-startup-udaan-to-trim-costs-ahead-of-2025-ipo/articleshow/105001132.cms,"E-commerce startup Udaan is working to curb costs and forge new partnerships with consumer brands in India as it prepares to go public in 2025.Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta said in an interview. That’s set to happen around the same time as its initial public offering, he said.The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said. “Second, strategically we want to ensure that we are top of mind with shopkeepers, with big manufacturers, and we maintain our relative market share.”Lightspeed Venture Partners-backed Udaan is among startups trying to tap the rapid growth of India’s economy and consumer market, while meeting investor demands for profitability. Udaan, which at its peak employed thousands, joined fellow Indian startups in slashing jobs last year and tightening internal controls and compliance. It now has about 1,800 staff, and Gupta didn’t specify if further job cuts are needed.Corporate governance lapses at Indian online tutoring firm Byju’s, once the country’s top startup with a valuation of $22 billion, shone a light at unique challenges faced by founders in the South Asian nation and drove companies to be more diligent.“We continue to move towards more professionalized management, professionalized board and also institutionalized shareholders as we go towards public markets,” Gupta said.Udaan is yet to decide whether it will list in India or overseas. It was valued at more than $3 billion in a 2021 funding round, and was in talks to raise $400 million, Business Standard reported in September. Lightspeed owns about 35% of Udaan, while Tencent Holdings Ltd. holds 6%.The company was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran Udaan until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021. The other two founders — Amod Malviya and Sujeet Kumar — are board members.Udaan built an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business still accounts for a very small part of India’s overall retail market but can balloon to $150 billion in sales and yield a 100% return on capital invested in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co. estimates published in the Mint newspaper.Bengaluru-based Udaan has also ventured into financing through its fintech unit which helps shopkeepers get working capital loans to buy inventory. That business is profitable before taxes and is growing 70% annually, Gupta said.“That’s a second business in the overall umbrella of Udaan trying to organize trade in the country,” Gupta said. “In addition to commerce, financing becomes an important market opportunity.”","Udaan will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta says.

Space sector start-up Sisir Radar to develop SAR on L/P band SAR,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/space-sector-start-up-sisir-radar-to-develop-sar-on-l/p-band-sar/articleshow/104558111.cms,"CHENNAI: Space sector startup, Sisir Radar Private Ltd has hit success at the prestigious iDEX DefSpace Challenge with its projects for development of “L/P band Continuous Wave SAR (synthetic aperture radar) payload for LEO Small Satellites” and “Unfurlable, Electronically Steering Antenna for L/P band SAR payload” for Indian Air Force (IAF), said a top company official.The company is promoted by former Director at the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) Tapan Misra and the brains behind the Indian space agency’s RISAT series of SAR satellites as well as the Dual Frequency SAR on the Chandrayaan 2 orbiter that is currently circling the moon.""A grant of Rs 3 crore is also there for development of the products,"" Misra told IANS.Synthetic Aperture Radar or SAR is a special kind of imaging radar technology that can provide extremely accurate high resolution imagery of the terrain through clouds, smoke and dust even in pitch dark conditions. SAR imagery provides much higher resolution than other forms of remote sensing technology such as hyperspectral and multispectral. SAR is a critical technology for strategic reconnaissance and planning as well as for disaster management.According to Misra, winning the challenge in just over a year of floating the company is a major booster.He said L and P band SAR have an advantage over other frequencies (like X band) when it comes to penetration capabilities through rain, clouds, foliage and vegetation in a tropical country like India, and underground penetration capabilities in dry terrain.Continuing further, he said the L band SAR will provide 1 metre resolution, spotlight resolution in Stripmap mode. The current industry standard is 5-10 metre in L band. Misra said both the L and P band will operate simultaneously from a satellite borne SAR. Recently, Sisir Radar successfully developed and tested the world’s highest resolution L-Band SAR fitted on a drone. With 0.2 metre resolution, this is by far the highest L band SAR in the world, he said.","Space sector startup, Sisir Radar Private Ltd has hit success at the prestigious iDEX DefSpace Challenge.

Testify: Sam Bankman-Fried acknowledges 'mistakes' but testifies he did not defraud anyone,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/cryptocurrency/sam-bankman-fried-acknowledges-mistakes-but-testifies-he-did-not-defraud-anyone/articleshow/104761929.cms,"<p>Sam Bankman-Fried (File Photo- Reuters)<br></p>

NEW YORK: Sam Bankman-Fried , testifying in his own defense at his fraud trial on Friday, acknowledged that a ""lot of people got hurt"" when the FTX cryptocurrency exchange he founded collapsed, but said he did not defraud anyone or take customer funds.Shortly after taking the witness stand in Manhattan federal court, Bankman-Fried said he made ""a number of small mistakes and a number of larger mistakes"" while running the now-bankrupt exchange. The biggest mistake, he said, was not implementing a dedicated risk management team.""We thought that we might be able to build the best product on the market,"" Bankman-Fried said. ""It turned out basically the opposite of that. A lot of people got hurt - customers, employees - and the company ended up in bankruptcy.""Prosecutors accuse Bankman-Fried of using FTX customer funds to prop up his crypto-focused hedge fund, Alameda Research, make speculative venture investments and donate more than $100 million to US political campaigns. He also faces charges of scheming to cheat Alameda's lenders and FTX investors.He has pleaded not guiltyBankman-Fried's trial, which began on October 3, is drawing to a close nearly a year after FTX collapsed amid a wave of customer withdrawals. The company declared bankruptcy in November 2022 and Bankman-Fried was indicted the following month.His testimony marked the first time the dozen jurors and five alternates have heard directly from the 31-year-old former billionaire after 12 trial days.Bankman-Fried, who was jailed in August after US District Judge Lewis Kaplan found he likely tampered with witnesses, wore a suit and spoke with two water bottles placed in front of him on the witness stand. The former mogul once known for wearing shorts and T-shirts and sporting an unkempt mop of curly locks cut his hair before his trial began.Responding to questions posed by his defense lawyer Mark Cohen, Bankman-Fried spoke in calm, measured tones during the first portion of his testimony as he recounted founding Alameda in 2017, shortly after graduating from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, despite knowing little about crypto.But Bankman-Fried - who had studied physics and worked as a quantitative trader at Jane Street - said he saw opportunities for ""arbitrage"" in the market for digital assets. He said Alameda's first office was in a small Airbnb in Berkeley, California, before he later moved the firm to Hong Kong.""We wanted to be under the radar at that point in time,"" he said on the stand, adding he named the hedge fund after the California county where it was founded in part so competitors would not discover what they were doing.Jurors have heard from three of his closest confidantes at FTX and Alameda, all of whom have pleaded guilty and agreed to cooperate with prosecutors. They testified earlier this month that they committed financial crimes at Bankman-Fried's behest.For criminal defendants, taking the stand is a risky proposition because it opens them up to potentially probing cross-examination by prosecutors.But given Bankman-Fried's penchant for risk, legal experts say he likely viewed taking the stand as his best shot to counter the allegations made by members of his inner circle, which were backed up by spreadsheets the three said demonstrated how customer funds were stolen and text messages in which they discussed FTX's shortfall of funds with Bankman-Fried.","Sam Bankman-Fried says he made ""a number of small mistakes and a number of larger mistakes"" while running the now-bankrupt exchange.

H-1B Crackdown! Trump Imposes $100k Fee; Indians & Tech Giants Face Major Hit; Know All About It

H-1B Visas: Wall Street Banks May Increase India Talent Dependence





US President Donald Trump ’s move to steeply hike the H-1B visa fees to $100,000 in a bid to create more jobs for Americans may actually end up backfiring! Major Wall Street banks are actually expected to increase their dependence on business support centres in India after Trump’s fee hike for new H-1B visa applications.Despite Trump's intention to safeguard American employment through immigration restrictions, analysts suggest these new regulations might encourage banks to strengthen their presence in Indian technology centres like Mumbai, Bengaluru and Hyderabad, which currently provide employment to over 1.9 million individuals.H-1B visas, extensively utilised by technology sectors in India and the US for skilled foreign workers, also see significant usage from financial and consulting organisations. During the US fiscal year ending September 2023, Indian nationals constituted 72.3% of total H-1B recipients, which includes both new and renewed employment.Also Read | The $100,000 H-1B gamble: Why Donald Trump’s visa tax won’t save American jobs - winners and losers According to a Bloomberg report, leading American banks, including Citigroup Inc., JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc., are significant employers at India's global capability centres, which handle various functions from trading assistance and risk assessment to technical support.These centres, employing software engineers, quantitative analysts and accounting professionals, provide cost-effective services whilst offering access to qualified professionals who are scarce in their domestic markets.US banks maintain substantial presence in this sector, enabling potential work relocation to India to navigate new visa regulations. The workforce numbers are significant: Citigroup maintains 33,000 personnel in India, Bank of America Corp. employs over 27,000, whilst JPMorgan has 10,000 staff.""Unless new restrictions are placed on offshoring, foreign banks will lean even more on their Indian capability centers,"" Umesh Chhazzed, founder of recruitment firm Anlage Infotech, who has worked with US lenders for more than two decades was quoted as saying in the Bloomberg report.According to EY data quoted in the report, Global Capability Centres have evolved into a $64 billion industry, showing 9.8% annual growth from 2019 to 2024. These centres are expected to increase from the current 1,700 to approximately 2,500 by 2030, with projected market value reaching $110 billion.""Banks would be calibrating a new strategy for the global capability centers. It appears, there will be onshoring of jobs to India adding new job functions,"" said Abizer Diwanji, founder of NeoStart Advisors LLP, a financial advisory firm. ""However, none will jump the gun amid evolving situations. They will wait for more clarity,” he was quoted as saying.Also Read | Alternatives to H-1B visas: After fee hike by Trump to $100,000, O1 & L1 visas gain traction; check cost, approval rates Research published in the Management Science journal indicates that companies typically respond to skilled immigration restrictions by increasing overseas recruitment. The 2023 study reveals that highly internationalised companies typically employ one overseas worker for each visa application rejection.According to the report, JPMorgan has welcomed the exemption of current H-1B visa holders from the new fee. Sjoerd Leenart, the bank's Asia-Pacific executive, during a Bloomberg Television interview on Monday indicated that an evaluation of the proposed modifications was premature.According to Parvathy Tharamel, partner at Trilegal law firm, India has established itself as the foundation of global capability centres for international banks, managing essential business, compliance, technology and innovation operations.""The new H-1B restrictions will only accelerate this trend, pushing more cross-border technology and high-value roles into India hubs,"" she was quoted as saying.Nevertheless, growth initiatives might be constrained by the possibility of additional US measures affecting banks' international strategies.","H-1B visas extensively utilised by technology sectors in India and US for skilled foreign workers.

Russia is doing bad things & must be stopped. Trade will feel the pressure from that: JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/russia-is-doing-bad-things-must-be-stopped-trade-will-feel-the-pressure-from-that-jp-morgan-ceo-jamie-dimon/articleshow/124058680.cms,"H-1B announcement came out of the blue, says Dimon





MUMBAI: He's been called America's most powerful banker, a man whose words are taken seriously by markets and policymakers around the world. Jamie Dimon is more than just chairman and CEO of JP Morgan, US's largest bank, he's become synonymous with it as it draws closer to becoming the first in the industry with a trillion-dollar valuation.So when TOI met him for an exclusive interview, the first questions were about Trump, tariffs, H-1B visas, India-US relations and geopolitics - before moving to the state of the economy in the two countries as well as globally.""I'm in the free trade camp,"" he said straight off the bat, ""except when it comes to national security"", before adding, ""There's also long-standing unfair trade, where industries get protected and political forces resist change.""Asked what it would take to get a trade deal, he said, ""I hope President Trump and PM Modi, who seem to respect each other, can reach an agreement. I see India as a natural friend of America. I don't think we need to ask you to align; we should extend our hand, build relationships. The Ukraine war has created big problems...we feel strongly Russia's doing bad things and must be stopped. Trade will feel the pressure from that.On Trump's weekend shocker on H-1B visas, Jamie Dimon said, ""It came out of the blue. We'll be engaging with stakeholders and policymakers. For us, visas matter because we move people around globally - experts who get promoted to new jobs in different markets.""""The challenge is that the US still needs to remain an attractive destination. My grandparents were Greek immigrants who never finished high school. America is an immigrant nation, and that's part of its core strength,"" he added.On the broader issue of tariffs and their impact on the economy, he said, ""I think tariffs are modestly inflationary. I'm not sure they're just a one-time effect. Some people say that, but in reality they'll come in pieces, not all at once. If they did come in immediately, you'd see a quick spike up and then down. All things being equal, it's a little recessionary, but really just one straw on the camel's back.""Turning to the Indian economy, Dimon, who's been coming to the country for 20 years, said, ""I'm very optimistic about its future. The economy has been growing at 6%, and that could and should continue for 20 years. The bigger caveat is the world order: India has benefited from a peaceful global system, even as you face your own local challenges.""""I think the reforms here are excellent, and the fact that your Prime Minister was able to get them done shows strong leadership. He's been a successful Prime Minister. And you're seeing similar shifts elsewhere: PM Starmer in the UK, Scholz in Germany, Macron in France, Meloni in Italy. They all want growth and investment, and they understand that being completely anti-business and anti-investment is not a good strategy for growing an economy.His biggest worry? ""That 30 years from now, we may read a book titled 'How the West Was Lost'. It could describe how, starting with Russia's invasion of Ukraine and terrorism in West Asia, Iran, Russia, North Korea - with some help from China - were able to dismantle the post-World War II order of law and stability. That system had been quite successful, and you benefited from it too. In this scenario, the world fragments into competing power blocs and bilateral alliances, resembling the pre-World War I or pre-World War II era, where every nation has to figure out how to protect itself. And in that environment, the strongest nation - China - could leave others acting as its vassals.""","Jamie Dimon is the chairman and CEO of JP Morgan, the US's largest bank.

BENGALURU: Some Indian IT stocks took a hit on BSE after US President Donald Trump 's latest proclamation on the H-1B visa , deepening concerns in an already fragile demand environment.

‘GST Bachat Utsav’ Kicks Off: Modi Unveils Reforms for Middle Class, Farmers

( Inputs from New Delhi )





PM Modi took his message of GST 2.0 and swadeshi resurgence to India's easternmost state of Arunachal Pradesh on Monday, hitting the ground running with public interactions and handing local traders in Itanagar posters declaring “Garv se kaho yeh swadeshi hai”.PM Modi, who inaugurated and launched projects worth Rs 5,000 crore — including two hydropower ventures and a high-altitude convention centre in the India-China border town of Tawang — also met local entrepreneurs to drill the importance of quality and promotion of made-in-India products.“As the sun rose today, so did a new chapter in India's economic journey, with the start of GST Bachat Utsav. And what better place to be than Arunachal Pradesh, India's beautiful Land of the Rising Sun,” Modi wrote on X.At IG Park in Itanagar, the PM acknowledged the sizeable presence of women in the gathering and said India’s “next-generation GST reforms” would bring significant relief to households by making kitchen supplies, educational materials, footwear and clothing more affordable. He iterated his commitment to boosting income and savings, reminding everyone that annual income up to Rs 12 lakh was now tax-free while GST had been pared to two slabs — 5% and 18% — with many items becoming tax-free.PM Modi, who visited Arunachal Pradesh on Monday, remotely laid the foundation stones for Heo (240 MW) and Tato-I (186 MW) hydropower projects, worth over Rs 3,700 crore, in the Siyom sub-basin. He highlighted Arunachal’s role in India’s goal of generating 500 GW of renewable energy by 2030.Criticising the opposition for decades of neglect, PM Modi said tribal-inhabited border areas used to be dismissed as “backward” & “last villages”.In contrast, the BJP govt has redefined them as “aspirational districts” and “first villages”, he said. Over 450 border hamlets of Arunachal are developing rapidly under the Vibrant Villages Programme and emerging as dynamic pockets of tourism and opportunity, the PM said.Modi later flew to Tripura’s Agartala and inaugurated the renovated Tripureswari temple in Gomati district. Built in 1501 by Maharaja Dhanya Manikya, the temple — regarded as one of the 51 Shakti Peethas — was restored under the Union govt’s PRASAD scheme with a budget of Rs 52 crore.In an open letter to citizens, posted on X later in the day, Modi elaborated on his address to the nation the previous evening. He said it was imperative to walk the path of self-reliance to achieve the collective goal of Viksit Bharat by 2047. “This year, the festive season brings an added reason to rejoice. These reforms will boost savings and directly benefit every section of society, be it farmers, women, youth, poor, middle class, traders, or MSMEs. They will encourage greater growth and investments and accelerate the progress of every state and region,” the letter states.“Your household expenses will reduce, and it will be easier to fulfil aspirations such as building a home, purchasing a vehicle, purchasing appliances, eating out, or planning a family vacation.”","PM Modi visited Arunachal Pradesh on Monday.

Crude Oil Prices Likely to Stay Stable Despite Global Conflicts, Says KPMG’s Anish De





NEW DELHI: The country's core sector grew at its fastest pace in 13 months in Aug, led by robust expansion in the output of coal, steel, and refinery products, as well as the base effect.Data released by the commerce and industry ministry on Monday showed that the eight core sectors - spanning coal, crude oil, natural gas, refinery products, fertilisers, steel, cement, and electricity - rose by an annual 6.3% in Aug. This was faster than the 3.7% growth in July and a contraction of 1.5% in Aug last year.The core sector accounts for nearly 41% of the index of industrial production (IIP), and the performance of the sector impacts the IIP numbers, which will be released later this month. The coal sector grew by 11.4% in Aug after contracting by 12.3% in the previous month. The steel sector rose by 14.2% in Aug after a robust 16.6% growth in July, while the cement sector grew by 6.1% during the month, slower than the 11.6% expansion in July.Two sectors - crude oil and natural gas - contracted in Aug, while refinery products grew by 3% in Aug after contracting by 1.1% in July. The electricity sector grew by 3.1% compared to an expansion of 3.7% in July and a contraction of 3.7% in Aug last year.""The uptick was particularly driven by coal, which witnessed an expansion of 11.4% in the month, following a double-digit contraction in July 2025. Overall, five of the eight sectors, barring steel, cement, and electricity, saw an improvement in their year-on-year growth performance in Aug vis-a-vis July,"" said Aditi Nayar, chief economist at ratings agency ICRA.","The country's core sector grew at its fastest pace in 13 months in Aug, led by robust expansion in the output of coal, steel, and refinery products.

‘GST Bachat Utsav’ Kicks Off: Modi Unveils Reforms for Middle Class, Farmers





NEW DELHI: Car dealers are looking at options to set off the impact of withdrawal of GST compensation cess on their bottomlines, with some of them contemplating legal challenge to the move.While restructuring GST, the GST Council decided to increase the rate from 28% to 40% but withdrew the cess on cars that ranged from 1% to 12-15%. Although the move has provided relief to most car buyers, dealers have had to shell out the 12% tax but are unable to set it off against the cess paid by them on inventory that was lying with them.Dealers had petitioned govt to address their concern and were in talks with manufacturers, suggesting that burden be shared. ""There is massive credit pending, which car dealers are unable to use and will have to write-off,"" said an industry source. Dealers believe the decision was sudden as the cess was to continue till March 2026. But the GST Council, which has representatives from the Centre and the states, opted to move to the new regime, without giving them adequate notice, dealing a severe financial blow.Initial estimates of the dealers' lobby had pegged the hit at Rs 2,500 crore, but impact is seen to be lower. Car dealers claim to be sitting on unsold inventory of a few lakh units, with auto industry complaining that sales slowed down after PM Narendra Modi announced Centre's intent to move ahead with GST reduction before Diwali.Compensation cess has been discontinued for luxury and sin goods, effective Monday, leaving tobacco and tobacco products, as only items on which it will continue till March, helping repay the interest and principal on the bonds that were issued to deal with compensation during Covid-19.","Dealers are looking at options to set off the impact of withdrawal of GST compensation cess on their bottomlines.

MUMBAI/ HYDERABAD: Prices of gold and silver scaled fresh all-time highs in India on Monday, as chances of lower interest rates in the US in the next few months - that in turn would mean weaker dollar - increased over the weekend. In addition, elevated geopolitical tension and tariff-induced global trade jitters supported the rally in the precious metals. Expected industrial demand for silver too boosted its price, industry experts and analysts said.In the international markets, gold traded at above the $3,750/ounce (Oz) level - a new all-time peak, and inched closer to $3,800. Silver too, rallied sharply to break above the $44/Oz mark, a new 14-year peak.Following the rallies in the international markets, combined with the weakness of the rupee, gold futures prices on MCX (Oct delivery) traded at close to the Rs 1.12 lakh/10gm mark, and silver futures prices (Dec delivery) traded at a peak of Rs 1.33 lakh/kg level, marking new all-time highs for the yellow and white metals.""The recent gold price surge to all-time high has been mostly propelled by international reasons like geopolitical tensions, trade turmoil, the effect of American tariffs, and poor labour market indicators in the US that led to the rate reduction (by the US central bank).These have added to the appeal of gold as a haven asset globally,"" said Colin Shah, MD, Kama Jewelry.Trump's policies, including the latest one related to H1B visas, has created more confusion in minds of people towards trade tensions around the world, which in turn is forcing central banks to intensify their buying of gold, said Avinash Gupta, vice chairman, All India Gem & Jewellery Domestic Council. ""Safe haven buying and central bank buying are the two key factors driving the price rise (for gold). $3,900-$4,000 is within reach now.

Gold Price Outlook

(Disclaimer: Recommendations and views on the stock market and other asset classes given by experts are their own. These opinions do not represent the views of The Times of India)





Gold price prediction today: Gold prices Last week saw a blend of inflation trends & political interference which involved Fed independence risk created a wave of uncertainty, boosting safe haven appeal for gold as it continued to hit record highs.In the US, mixed inflation data, cooling labour markets, and weakening consumer sentiment kept expectations of a Fed rate cut in place. In Europe, political instability in France added to economic pressure, while the ECB held rates steady. China grappled with deflationary pressures & Japan prepared for snap elections.Other asset classes included, global equity markets ending the week higher, while US Treasury yields, & the US dollar weakened, while oil prices edged up.Gold recorded repeated all-time highs edging near to $ 3,700 per oz in the current week. Gold ETF investors continued to be heavy buyers continuing their purchase for third consecutive months with net holdings rising steadily. led by Western funds. (YTD Inflows: 472.7 tonnes inflows. Vs 6.8 tonnes outflows in 2024).In India, Gold ETFs recorded inflows of Rs 2,190 crore in August, the largest since January’s Rs. 3,751 crores.Global central banks now own more gold than US Treasuries for the first time since 1996, indicating a substantial shift in their foreign exchange holdings. Gold has already surpassed the euro as the second most important reserve asset after the US dollar. Adjusting for over four decades of inflation the spot price of gold, also surpassed its inflation adjusted peak of $ 850 set on January 21, 1980 which comes to around $3590 per oz.The current week remains most crucial for gold as the US Fed may announce its monetary policy on September 17, midnight. It is widely expected that the central bank may go ahead to slash its interest rates by 25 bps, as a slight possibility of a 50 bp cut also exists. Overall possibility of 3 rate cuts persists by the end of the year. Having said that, a summary of economic projections which includes projections on interest rate cuts to be released by the US Fed during the meeting remains crucial to be assessed for further direction in precious metal prices.Overall, a likely hawkish cut could bring in profit booking moves in prices. However, chances of any major correction lower remains' limited, as the US labour market shows signs of weakening, where major supports lie at around $ 3620 – 3570 zone (CMP $ 3685). On the higher side, prices could turn volatile in the coming session post release of Fed statement as strong upside barriers could persist at around $ 3,720 – 3,750 per oz in spot. This could translate to a level of Rs. 1,12,000 - 1,12,500 // 10 gm on MCX futures contract on a higher side on a weekly basis.","Gold recorded repeated all-time highs edging near to $ 3,700 per oz in the current week.

This deadline has not been extended further.So, what happens if one misses the deadline?Taxpayers missing the deadline can still file a belated return until December 31, 2025, but it may attract penalties and other consequences.Any ITR filed after the due date is considered a belated return and can be submitted until December 31, 2025. While filing a belated ITR allows taxpayers to comply with the law, it comes with certain limitations, including late fees and other potential consequences.Tax experts advise taxpayers to act promptly and file their ITR by September 16 to avoid unnecessary penalties and complications.Chartered Accountant Hitesh Jain, Partner – Direct Tax, N. A. Shah Associates LLP, explained that under Section 115BAC, effective from Assessment Year 2024-25, the new tax regime is the default option.Jain said, “So if a taxpayer wants to opt for the old regime, then ITR needs to be filed before the due date prescribed under Section 139(1) which is September 15, 2025 for FY 2024-25 (AY 2025-26).”This means that taxpayers without business income can select the old tax regime only through the original ITR filed on or before the due date. Jain added that deductions such as house rent allowance (HRA), home loan principal and interest under Section 80C, leave travel allowance (LTA), and others cannot be claimed if the ITR is filed after the deadline. In cases where the total tax liability is lower under the old regime, missing the September 15 deadline could lead to a higher effective tax liability.Taxpayers who miss the September 16 deadline for filing their ITR must pay a late fee of up to Rs 5,000. Those with an annual income exceeding Rs 5 lakh will be liable for a Rs 5,000 fee, while individuals earning below Rs 5 lakh will pay Rs 1,000. No late fee is charged for filing a nil belated return.A belated ITR is treated the same as a return filed on or before the original deadline when it comes to refunds. Taxpayers can claim a refund when filing a belated ITR, provided they complete all necessary bank validation and compliance requirements.One has to file an ITR after the due date (belated ITR) by logging into the ITR filing portal and then select the filing section as 139(4). The rest process is the same as filing an original ITR.Belated ITRs can be revised, but only until December 31, 2025. Any revision requests submitted after this date will not be accepted.","The Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) on Monday extended the income tax return (ITR) filing deadline for individual taxpayers by one day, from September 15 to September 16, 2025 for AY 2025-26.

Singapore firm rejects $1 billion Sri Lankan pollution damages,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/singapore-firm-rejects-1-billion-sri-lankan-pollution-damages/articleshow/124059210.cms,"



SINGAPORE: A Singapore shipping company told AFP on Tuesday it will refuse to pay Sri Lankan court-ordered damages of US$1 billion for causing that country's worst case of environmental pollution.In an exclusive interview, X-Press Feeders chief executive Shmuel Yoskovitz said he believed paying would have wide-ranging implications on global shipping and ""set a dangerous precedent"".The company operated the MV X-Press Pearl that sank off Colombo Port in June 2021 after a fire -- believed caused by a nitric acid leak -- that raged for nearly two weeks.Its cargo included 81 containers of hazardous goods, including acids and lead ingots, and hundreds of tonnes of plastic pellets.The ship was refused permission by ports in Qatar and India to offload the leaking nitric acid before it arrived in Sri Lankan waters.Tonnes of microplastic granules from the ship inundated an 80-kilometre (50-mile) stretch of beach along Sri Lanka's western coast. Fishing was prohibited for months.Sri Lanka's Supreme Court in July ordered the company to pay Colombo an ""initial"" US$1 billion in damages within a year, with the first tranche of US$250 million to be paid by Tuesday.It also ordered the company ""to make such other and further payments"" in the future as the court may direct.'Hanging guillotine'Yoskovitz rejected the open-ended nature of the penalty.""We are not paying because the whole base of maritime trade is based on the limitation of liability. This judgment undermines this limitation of liability,"" he told AFP.""Any payment towards the judgment could set a dangerous precedent for how maritime incidents will be resolved in the future,"" he said.Yoskovitz said the absence of limitations could lead to higher insurance premiums, which would be ultimately passed on to consumers.The chief executive again apologised for the incident, saying the company recognised the disaster and was trying to make amends.He said X-Press Feeders had already spent $170 million to remove the wreck, clean up the seabed and beaches, and compensate affected fishermen.""We are not trying to hide... We are willing to pay more, but it has to be under certain marine conventions and an amount that is full and final and then it can be settled, and we can move on,"" he said.""But to live under this hanging guillotine -- it is simply impossible to operate like this.""Long-term effectsIn Colombo, Sri Lanka's Supreme Court has scheduled a hearing on Thursday about the implementation of its decision.One of the petitioners who sought compensation for the pollution has called for further research to determine the full extent of the damage to the island's marine ecosystems.""If you visit the coastlines today, there is nothing visible in terms of plastic pollution. A major clean-up took place soon after the X-Press Pearl incident, but the effects of the pollution will be felt for a long time,"" said Hemantha Withanage from the Centre for Environmental Justice.It remains unclear how Sri Lanka's Supreme Court could enforce its decision.However, in its 361-page decision in July, the court ordered the police and the state prosecutor to initiate criminal proceedings for non-compliance if the parties were present in Sri Lanka.Yoskovitz expressed concern over the ship's Russian captain, Vitaly Tyutkalo, who has been banned from leaving Sri Lanka for more than four years, as well as the company's third-party agents there.The firm had offered to pay a fine for the skipper's release, but this was refused, according to Yoskovitz.X-Press Feeders obtained an order from London's Admiralty Court in July 2023, limiting its liability to a maximum of 19 million pounds (US$25 million), but Sri Lanka has challenged that.The Sri Lankan government also filed a lawsuit against the ship's owners in the Singapore International Commercial Court. But that has been stayed pending the result of the case in London, with a pre-trial hearing expected in May 2026.","Sri Lanka's Supreme Court in July ordered the company to pay Colombo an ""initial"" US$1 billion in damages within a year.

"The $100,000 H-1B gamble: Why Donald Trump’s visa tax won’t save American jobs",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/the-100000-h-1b-gamble-why-donald-trumps-visa-tax-wont-save-american-jobs-winners-and-losers/articleshow/124050520.cms,"AI image for representation only.

TL;DR: Driving the news

TACO Storm: MAGA Torches Trump Over $100K H-1B Fee Backtrack, Calls Him ‘Weak’

The Financial Times estimated US employers could face $14 billion in added costs annually under the plan.

Why it matters

The H-1B program, created by Congress in 1990, is the main gateway for highly skilled immigrants, particularly in STEM fields. It supplies engineers, computer scientists, doctors, and professors to US companies and universities.

The sudden shock of a $100,000 barrier risks:

Disrupting tech and healthcare workforces that already face shortages.

Forcing companies to offshore projects to India, Mexico, or Canada.

Weakening US universities’ appeal, since foreign students often stay on through H-1Bs.

Rutgers economist Jennifer Hunt told the Wall Street Journal: “This misguided measure could shut down the H-1B program entirely. And if that happens, it’ll have a very detrimental effect on the economy as a whole.”

The big picture

A 2015 paper by economists Giovanni Peri, Kevin Shih, and Chad Sparber found influxes of foreign-born workers raised wages for US-born workers.

A 2023 study by economist Britta Glennon showed that when H-1B immigration is restricted, US multinationals simply shift jobs abroad.

George Mason University’s Michael Clemens told WSJ: “H-1B visas cause innovation, they cause entrepreneurship, they cause more R&D investment. They cause higher productivity in the whole US economy, which generates job opportunities and higher earnings for native workers.”

Between the lines:

Who’s affected most

Tech giants: Amazon, Google, Meta, Microsoft, and Apple employ thousands of H-1B holders. A $100,000 fee could drive them to expand offshore capability centers instead of hiring in the US.

Companies most dependent on US based employees with H-1B visas

Universities and hospitals: Nonprofits rely heavily on H-1Bs for professors, researchers, and physicians. Immigration lawyer Karin Wolman told Bloomberg: “The intended effect is to make the H-1B unreachable for entry-level professionals … The impact on health care alone will be devastating.”

Startups and smaller firms: Many can’t afford a six-figure visa bill, leaving them shut out of the global talent market.

India’s role: Indians account for about 70% of H-1B visas.

The whole idea is, no more will these big tech companies or other companies train foreign workers. … If you’re going to train somebody, you’re going to train one of the recent graduates from one of the great universities across our land. Commerce secretary Howard Lutnick

What they are saying

Proponents: Trump told reporters in the Oval Office, “We’re having people come in, people that in many cases are very successful or whatever, as opposed to walking over the borders.”

MAGA activists blasted him for softening the measure by making the fee one-time instead of annual. One fumed on X: “This isn’t miscommunication. Trump chickened out yet again.”

Critics: Nasscom, India’s IT industry body, warned the move could disrupt business continuity and cause “ripple effects on America’s innovation ecosystem.”

Workers: At San Francisco airport, immigrants rushed home after companies urged staff to return before the fee deadline. “It’s quite tragic. We have built a life here,” one engineer told Reuters.

Zoom in: MAGA backlash

The $100,000 fee didn’t go far enough for some of Trump’s supporters. MAGA hardliners mocked him with the nickname “TACO” - Trump Always Chickens Out — after the White House clarified the fee would be a one-time charge and apply only to new visas after March 2026.

Activists demanded the fee extend to renewals and transfers.

Some want to dismantle OPT (Optional Practical Training) and L-1 visas, which allow student graduates and corporate transferees to work in the US.

David Frum, a former George W Bush speechwriter, warned the backlash reveals a deeper American pessimism: “The people behind Maga are people who are not optimistic about the future of the United States. Maga is strongest where America is least competitive.”

The reverse brain drain

India’s tech sector is already preparing to welcome back H-1B talent. Analysts say the new policy could turbocharge growth in global capability centers (GCCs) in India, Canada, and Mexico, where US firms are shifting strategic work.

“The ‘American Dream’ for aspiring workers will be tough,” said Ganesh Natarajan, former CEO of Zensar Technologies. “I expect firms to restrict cross-border travel and get more work done out of India, Mexico and the Philippines.”

Indian startups see an opportunity. Manav Garg, founder of Together Fund, told the Economic Times: “Right now, AI is the gold rush. Many of them may launch startups or join as early employees. That is a massive talent shift.”

A Nasscom-S&P report noted Indian IT firms already employ 207,000 people in the US and generate $396 billion in US sales output. Sending skilled professionals back home could tilt global innovation further east.

What’s next

Immigration lawyers say the proclamation is vulnerable to lawsuits because fees must reflect processing costs and go through public comment. “It was timed to create pandemonium,” Karin Wolman, a New York-based lawyer, told the NYT. “No one else will be able to afford it - startups, small companies, nonprofits, universities, hospitals.”

Sophie Alcorn, CEO of Alcorn Immigration Law, told Reuters she expects “several lawsuits will be immediately forthcoming this week.”

Legal challenges could slow or overturn the policy. Courts have struck down past attempts to raise H-1B wage thresholds.

Congressional pressure: Some Republicans quietly worry the crackdown could hurt US competitiveness. But MAGA-aligned lawmakers want Trump to go further.

Business adaptation: Tech firms and universities may accelerate offshore hiring, automation, or near-shoring to Mexico and Canada.

Talent shift: If the fee survives, expect a sharper “ghar wapsi” wave - Indian engineers leaving the US to build startups at home.

The bottom line





US President Donald Trump’s proclamation to impose a $100,000 fee on new H-1B visas has jolted corporate America, global talent, and many immigrant communities – particularly Indian-Americans. Rolled out with little warning, the six-figure charge is meant to curb what Trump and his allies call the “most abused visa” and force tech giants to hire American workers instead.But economists, immigration experts, and industry leaders say the move is more likely to backfire - slowing US innovation, pushing jobs overseas, and accelerating a talent shift back to India.H-1B visas have long been a political lightning rod. Critics argue companies use them to replace Americans with lower-paid foreigners. Proponents point to decades of research showing they boost wages and productivity for native workers by spurring innovation.Many H-1B workers go on to found startups, file patents, and create jobs. Others teach, work in hospitals, or support US universities through research.Denying them entry—or pricing them out—may give American tech workers a brief reprieve. But in the long run, it’s a surefire way to stifle the innovation ecosystem that supports the entire economy, the WSJ report said.The new fee could accelerate a “reverse brain drain”: skilled engineers returning to India and fueling its AI and SaaS boom.“Trump’s $100,000 H-1B fee is economic suicide for America,” Vivek Wadhwa, a former fellow at Harvard Law School, told the TOI . “It will force Indian talent to go home … driving innovation out of the US and handing India an economic gift.”Trump’s $100,000 H-1B fee might win applause from immigration hardliners, but the economic evidence suggests it won’t protect most American workers. Instead, it risks exporting US jobs, draining talent, and undermining competitiveness - while giving India’s tech sector an unexpected boost.(With inputs from agencies)","The H-1B program, created by Congress in 1990, is the main gateway for highly skilled immigrants, particularly in STEM fields.

US social security 2026: COLA rises slightly; what does this mean for retirees’ take-home pay?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-social-security-2026-cola-rises-slightly-what-does-this-mean-for-retirees-take-home-pay/articleshow/124048849.cms,"2026

cost-of-living adjustment

(COLA) provides limited relief





Disabled and low-income Americans are facing increasing obstacles in accessing Social Security benefits, a report scheduled for release next month finds. Advocates warn that changes under the Trump administration--including staff reductions, updated phone systems, and policy tweaks--have made high-touch support harder to obtain, raising risks of food insecurity, housing instability, and mental health crises.The research, conducted by California State University, Sacramento; University of Wisconsin-Madison; and State University of New York, Binghamton, draws on interviews with 14 benefits specialists, attorneys, and other advocates who assist multiple claimants, according to US-based news portal Axios. The findings highlight difficulties in navigating Supplemental Security Income (SSI) and disability benefits, particularly for those without reliable internet access.“Every time I went to the appointment, they said it's only for 10 minutes,” said F. Johnson. She described efforts to restore SSI benefits for her 19-year-old disabled grandson, noting little success until legal counsel intervened. Advocates report similar experiences nationwide, with short office visits and rerouted calls frustrating claimants.SSI recipients include nearly 900,000 individuals with intellectual disabilities, 800,000 autistic or developmentally disabled people, and 350,000 living with schizophrenia.Recipients cannot hold more than Rs2,000 ($24) in the bank, and the rules for reporting changes to the SSA are complex. Barton Mackey, press officer at the SSA, said, “The commissioner recently named a dedicated executive to lead SSI, a first for the agency, bringing a heightened focus on reducing complexity and easing the ability for recipients to report changes. ”The agency has implemented electronic verification of wages and assets to reduce claimant burden and improve payment accuracy. Customer satisfaction data indicates that nearly 90% of callers were satisfied or beyond satisfied. Commissioner Frank Bisignano noted that most interactions occur online: “We do 1.5 trillion transactions on the web a day and only 130,000 visitors to our field office.”Despite these improvements, advocates say navigating the system remains challenging. “Processes have become not easier, but much harder,” a Denver-based benefits specialist noted. Legal Services of Philadelphia attorney Jen Burdick reported clients losing payments, facing eviction notices, or becoming homeless, highlighting the stakes for low-income beneficiaries.Adding to the financial pressures, Social Security’s 2026 cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) is projected at 2.7–2.8%, slightly above the 2.5% increase in 2025. For the average retiree receiving Rs2,008 ($24,000 annually), this translates to roughly Rs54 ($0.64) per month. Rising Medicare Part B premiums, projected to increase by Rs21.50 ($0.25) monthly, will reduce the net gain to around Rs32–33 ($0.38), limiting the benefit of the COLA increase.Other 2026 changes include increasing the full retirement age to 66 years and 10 months for those born in 1959, raising the taxable wage base, and adjusting earnings thresholds for retirees under full retirement age.Financial planners advise retirees to factor in rising healthcare and prescription drug costs when budgeting and to consider supplemental income sources to preserve long-term stability. While the COLA offers some relief, systemic barriers in accessing SSI and disability benefits remain a pressing concern for millions relying on Social Security as a lifeline.The SSA will announce the final 2026 COLA in mid-October along with Medicare premium adjustments. The upcoming research report will provide further insight into the obstacles facing disabled and low-income beneficiaries, highlighting a system under strain even as modest adjustments offer limited financial relief.","Advocates warn that changes under the Trump administration have made high-touch support harder to obtain.

4. COLA raises benefits

5. Medicare costs likely to rise





Social Security affects millions of Americans, with over 70 million receiving payments in July, and the number continues to rise each month.Although the program is in need of major reforms, it frequently undergoes smaller adjustments. Some are set by law, while others can be made through executive orders, a power that US President Donald Trump has actively used in his first seven months back in office.Here are five upcoming Social Security changes that retirees should know about:Trump signed an executive order in March ending paper Social Security checks. The deadline for compliance is September 30, meaning October will mark the first month without paper checks.Recipients must now have a direct deposit set up with their bank or use a Direct Express card, a prepaid debit card for those without bank accounts.A Social Security spokesperson advised, as quoted by USA Today, “If you're one of them, be sure to update your information with the Social Security office or online at my social security before the end of the month.”The department of education paused student loan collections in 2020 but resumed in May 2025.Temporary delays on garnishing Social Security payments are ending.The DOE said in June, “Please be aware that the department of education is delaying offsets of these monthly benefits for a couple of months and plans to resume sometime this summer.” Defaulting recipients may see up to 15% of their benefits garnished.Social Security is funded through payroll taxes, with workers paying 6.2% of earnings, matched by employers. High earners pay taxes only up to the maximum taxable income, which rises annually.For 2025, the maximum taxable earnings is $176,100, up from $168,600 in 2024. This means higher-income workers will pay more in Social Security taxes, boosting program revenue.Social Security benefits are protected against inflation via a cost-of-living adjustment (COLA). Recipients received a 2.5% increase in 2025, and analysts predict a 2.7% adjustment for the upcoming year, based on current data. The official number will be confirmed in mid-October.Medicare Part B premiums are automatically deducted from Social Security benefits. Due to rising healthcare costs, 2026 premiums are estimated to reach $206.20 per month, up from $185 this year, an 11.5% increase.For recipients with lower Social Security payments, the “hold harmless” policy protects them from reductions due to higher Medicare premiums. However, most beneficiaries will still experience the impact of rising healthcare costs on their monthly payments.","President Donald Trump signed an executive order in March ending paper Social Security checks.

NEW YORK/WASHINGTON: US lawmakers and community leaders voiced concern over US President Donald Trump's plan to impose a USD 100,000 fee on H-1B visa applications, calling the move ""reckless"" and ""unfortunate"" that will have a ""huge negative"" impact on the IT industry.Trump's USD 100,000 H-1B visa fee is a ""reckless attempt to cut America off from high-skilled workers who have long strengthened our workforce, fuelled innovation, and helped build industries that employ millions of Americans,"" Congressman Raja Krishnamoorthi said.Krishnamoorthi said many H-1B holders ultimately become citizens and launch businesses that create well-paying jobs in the US. ""While other nations race to attract global talent, the United States should strengthen its workforce and modernise our immigration system-not erect barriers that weaken our economy and security,"" he said.Former advisor to president Joe Biden and Asian-American community leader on immigration policy, Ajay Bhutoria, warned of a potential crisis for the US technology sector's competitive edge with Trump's new plan to impose the ""staggering"" H1-B fee.""The H-1B programme, a lifeline for innovation that has attracted top talent from around the world, faces unprecedented barriers with this massive jump from the current USD 2000-USD 5000 total fee, which will crush small businesses and startups reliant on diverse talent,"" Bhutoria said.Bhutoria added that the move will drive away skilled professionals who power Silicon Valley and contribute billions to the US economy.He said the move may backfire by pushing talent to competitors like Canada or Europe. He called for a balanced reform like exempting startups or prioritising merit-based selection instead of ""this extreme overhaul"".Khanderao Kand of the Foundation for India and Indian Diaspora Studies said the USD 100,000 fee for H1-Bs is a very unfortunate policy with huge negative impact on businesses particularly software and tech industry as well as US-educated STEM talent who are already struggling due to negative impact of AI and tariffs.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground.Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change, too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Startups will play an important role in helping India become the third largest economy in the world, Chief Economic Advisor ( CEA ) to the Union government V Anantha Nageswaran has said.Nageswaran said that tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country due to improvements in infrastructure and supportive policies of the government, according to a KSUM release.The CEA, during his Leadership Talk on the concluding day of the Huddle Global 2023 organised by the Kerala Startup Mission (KSUM), said that India was the fifth largest economy on course to become the third largest in a few years.""In fact, I will say 7-in-7 is the buzz slogan, that is 7 trillion USD economy in seven years. Seven trillion USD economy size by 2030 is possible if India maintains its present growth trajectory, and in that journey startup entrepreneurs are going to play an important role,"" he is quoted as having said in the release.He was of the view that the active participation of startups in India in developing business models on the foundation of expanding physical and digital infrastructure will continue to generate efficiency, revenue and economic returns for the country.""The last decade has seen an exceptional transformation in the startup landscape in India, which has emerged as the third largest ecosystem globally, with over 1.12 lakh startups presently recognised by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) across 763 districts.""Among them, more than 110 are unicorns with a total valuation of around USD 350 billion,"" he said.The CEA further said that the country ranks second in innovation quality.He said that innovation in India was not just limited to certain sectors as startups were solving problems in 56 industrial sectors, with 13 per cent of them from IT services, nine per cent from health and life sciences, seven per cent from education, five per cent from agriculture and five per cent from food and beverages.Nageswaran also said it was significant that 49 per cent of the startups were from tier-2 and 3 cities which have turned to be game-changers as the business advantages in these locations enable entrepreneurs to operate at lower costs as compared to tier-1 cities.""Apart from improved infrastructure and the government's pro-active policies, the availability of a technically skilled talent pool is a huge advantage for startups to set up and flourish in tier-2 and tier-3 cities,"" he said.He said that historically there was a perception that small towns were difficult places to conduct business.""...but with improved internet penetration, vastly better physical infrastructure, road, rail and air connectivity and supportive government policies, this is no longer true,"" he said.He also noted Kerala's startup journey has been an inspiring one.The CEA said that KSUM has served as the catalyst since its establishment in 2006 to promote change that propelled the state into the forefront of the global startup arena.KSUM is the Kerala government's nodal agency established in 2006 for entrepreneurship development and incubation activities in the state.Nageswaran said that with over 4,000 registered tech startups, 63 incubators and 10 lakh square feet of incubation space, KSUM has not only met its goal of promoting technology-based entrepreneurship but has also earned the distinguished position of being among the world's top business incubators.The November 16-18 fifth edition of Huddle Global, India's biggest beachside startup conclave, was organised by KSUM at Adimalathura beach, near Vizhinjam, here.Attended by around 1,500 delegates, the event displayed sophisticated products from emerging sectors such as robotics, Artificial Intelligence , Machine Learning, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, life sciences, space tech, blockchain, IoT, e-governance, fintech, healthtech, agritech, edutech and SaaS from across the country.","Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran said tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country.

The trio together ran Udaan until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021. The other two founders — Amod Malviya and Sujeet Kumar — are board members.Udaan built an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business still accounts for a very small part of India’s overall retail market but can balloon to $150 billion in sales and yield a 100% return on capital invested in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co. estimates published in the Mint newspaper.Bengaluru-based Udaan has also ventured into financing through its fintech unit which helps shopkeepers get working capital loans to buy inventory. That business is profitable before taxes and is growing 70% annually, Gupta said.“That’s a second business in the overall umbrella of Udaan trying to organize trade in the country,” Gupta said. “In addition to commerce, financing becomes an important market opportunity.”","Udaan will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta says. Udaan competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods. The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-105001128,imgsize-151312,width-400,resizemode-4/105001128.jpg"

How India's GDP has been growing

What SBI report said on savings and investment

Incremental capital output ratio

NEW DELHI: India's gross domestic product (GDP) data for the third quarter (October-December 2022) received a word of caution from the former Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Raghuram Rajan In an interview with news agency PTI, Rajan that India is ""dangerously close"" to the Hindu rate of growth in view of subdued private sector investment, high interest rates and slowing global growth.India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%.Rajan termed this sequential slowdown in growth as ""worrying"".However, a report released by the State Bank of India (SBI) economists on Tuesday dismissed arguments that India is dangerously close to Hindu rate of growth saying such statements are ""ill-conceived, biased and premature"".The term 'Hindu growth rate' was coined by late economist Raj Krishna in 1978 to describe the slow growth in the country.It basically refers to the low pace of economic growth rates during 1950s to 1980s. During this period, the Indian economy averaged 3.5%.A former lecturer at the Delhi School of Economics (DSE), Krishna noted that only if the rate of growth is persistently slow and accompanied by low per-capita GDP, then it will be known as Hindu rate of growth but it has to factor in population growth as well.Before economic reforms of 1991, India's economic growth remained stagnant and low, while per capita income averaged around 1.3%.Krishna termed this low growth situation to be a result of socialist policies of state control and import substitution.However, the economic situation changed when liberalisation, privatisation and globalisation (LPG) reforms came into effect in the year 1991, at a time when India faced balance of payment crisis.Over the years, many economists have strongly opposed the idea of 'Hindu growth rate' and the term never had universal acceptance.The Indian economy plunged into its very first technical recession in FY21 due to the impact of Covid-19 pandemic and the related nationwide lockdowns. GDP shrunk by an unprecedented 23.8% in the first quarter of the financial year 2020-21. However, due to spurt in economic activities in the subsequent quarters, the GDP decline started to narrow.However, if we look at the period before Covid-19 as well, India's growth curve shows a declining trend.From 8.26% in FY17, GDP growth plunged to 3.74% in FY20. Shutdown of economic activities in FY21 in wake of Covid-19 only made matters worse.As lockdowns started to ease and business activities resumed, India's GDP also started rising. In Q1 of FY22, growth jumped to 20.1% mainly on account of low base effect. By the fourth quarter of FY22, growth came down to 4.10%.Similarly, the new financial year 2022-23 brought fresh economic challenges in the form of Russia-Ukraine war that impacted almost all major economies of the world, slowed the pace of growth, pushed inflation to record highs.As a result, the central banks of all advanced economies spurred into action and opted for monetary policy tightening to curb the soaring inflation.With persistently rising interest rates, India's economy grew by 4.4% in Q3 of FY23, as the Centre revised upwards GDP growth for previous year to 9.10% from 8.7% earlier.The report weighed recent GDP numbers against the available data on savings and investments for the past decade and highlighted some interesting points.""Quarterly growth numbers are noisy and should be best avoided for any serious interpretation (on an average, India's GDP growth has witnessed Rs 2 lakh crore upward revision for the 3 year ended FY23),"" the report said.Gross capital formation (GCF) by the government touched a high of 11.8% in 2021-22, up from 10.7% in 2020-21.""This also had a domino effect on private sector investment that jumped from 10 per cent to 10.8% over the same period,"" it said.In fact, Ecowrap added that the trends in GCF to gross output ratio or the plough back of funds for creation of fresh capacity shows that for public administration the ratio attained fresh peak in 2021-22 owing to the emphasis on capital expenditure in recent budgets.At the aggregate level, gross capital formation is supposed to have crossed 32% in 2022-23, the highest level since 2018-19.According to the report, in 2021-22, gross savings have risen to 30% from 29% in 2020-21.""The ratio is supposed to have crossed 31 per cent in 2022-23, the highest since 2018-19. The household savings increased sharply during the pandemic period on account of sharp accretion in financial savings such as deposits,"" said the report by SBI's Economic Research Department.While household financial savings have since then moderated from 15.4% in 2020-21 to 11.1% in 2022-23, savings in physical assets have grown sharply to 11.8% in 2021-22 from 10.7% in 2020-21.The report further analysed Incremental Capital Output ratio (ICOR) -- which measures additional units of capital (investment) needed to produce additional units of output. It said that the ratio has been improving.""ICOR which was 7.5 in FY 12 is now only 3.5 in FY22. Clearly, only half of capital is now needed for next unit of output,"" the report noted.Such reducing ICOR in the current years reflects a relatively increasing efficiency of capital and shows that the economy is on a sound footing, the report said.""From that point of view, future GDP growth rates even at 7% could still mean a decent number by any standards!,"" it added.","India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%.

An employee is entitled for a 50 per cent amount of the last drawn salary as pension.OPS was discontinued by the NDA government in 2003 with effect from April 1, 2004.Under the new pension scheme (NPS), employees contribute 10 per cent of their basic salary towards pension while the government contributes 14 per cent.Governments of Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand have informed the central government/ Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA about their decision to restart OPS for their employees.The government of Punjab on November 18, 2022, issued a notification regarding implementation of OPS for the state government employees who are being covered under NPS.

NEW DELHI: Consumption of petrol, diesel and jet fuel continued to gallop apace in February, prompted by early onset of summer and harvesting pushing up demand from the farm sector and increased mobility prompted by expanding economic activities.Early trade data shows petrol consumption rising 13%, diesel 12% and jet fuel almost 41% over the same month a year ago. Consumption of LPG , mostly used by households for cooking, grew maintained the usual modest growth at 2.4%.The growth in consumption was substantially higher than in the same month of 2021 when the economy began firing up after the pandemic.

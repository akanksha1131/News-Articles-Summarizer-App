Gold and silver price prediction today:Gold has surpassed the crucial psychological mark of $4,000, signaling strong bullish momentum and renewed investor confidence in the precious metal. This uptrend is supported by the pattern of higher highs and higher lows, indicating sustained buying interest and a robust technical structure. The rally in gold can be attributed to global economic uncertainty, rising geopolitical tensions, and continued interest from central banks diversifying their reserves away from fiat currencies. Additionally, expectations of lower interest rates and persistent inflation concerns have further boosted gold’s appeal as a safe-haven asset.On the MCX front, gold prices have shown remarkable strength, trading well above the ₹1,22,000 mark. The momentum remains positive, with the next potential target seen around ₹1,27,000, provided prices sustain above the immediate support level of ₹1,20,000. Any minor dips towards this support zone are likely to attract fresh buying interest from traders and investors. Overall, the outlook for gold remains optimistic in both international and domestic markets, with the bullish sentiment expected to continue in the near term.As long as prices hold above key support zones, gold is likely to maintain its upward trajectory, reflecting ongoing global demand and macroeconomic tailwinds.COMEX Silver is on the verge of reclaiming the $50 mark, a level last seen in 2011, marking a significant milestone in the ongoing bullish momentum. The metal’s resurgence reflects strong investment demand, robust industrial use—particularly in solar panels and electric vehicles—and a renewed interest in precious metals as a hedge against inflation. If silver successfully breaches the $50 resistance, the next potential targets lie at $56 and subsequently $60, which would reaffirm the long-term bullish trend. The recent price action highlights growing confidence among investors as silver continues to outperform many other commodities.On the MCX front, silver prices have maintained strong upward momentum, currently trading well above the ₹1,43,000 support level. If this level continues to hold, prices have the potential to rally towards ₹1,56,000 in the near term. The overall trend remains positive, supported by global cues and firm demand from both industrial and investment segments. Any corrective moves are likely to be short-lived, as long as silver sustains above its key support zones. With bullish technicals and strong fundamentals, silver appears poised to continue its upward journey, potentially testing multi-year highs and reaffirming its strength in the global precious metals space.","Gold and silver prices are exhibiting bullish momentum, says Abhilash Koikkara, Head - Forex & Commodities, Nuvama Professional Clients Group.

Heavy rare earth monopoly: China seeks India guarantee that magnets won’t be re-exported to US; here’s why,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/heavy-rare-earth-monopoly-china-seeks-india-guarantee-that-magnets-wont-be-re-exported-to-us-heres-why/articleshow/124406082.cms,"China has sought assurances from India that heavy rare earth magnets they supply will be utilised exclusively for domestic requirements.

Rare Earth Play





China will export rare earth magnets to India only if it assures that they will be used for domestic needs and will not find their way to the US. Indian companies have already provided end-user certificates confirming the magnets will not be used in weapons of mass destruction production.China has sought assurances from India that heavy rare earth magnets they supply will be utilised exclusively for domestic requirements and not be exported to the United States.Sources quoted in an ET report said that Beijing has asked export control assurances similar to the Wassenaar Arrangement framework. Whilst India is a member of this 42-nation agreement promoting responsible transfer of dual-use technologies and goods for international security purposes, China remains outside the arrangement.""China wants to ensure that the heavy rare earth magnets supplied to India do not reach the US,"" the ET report said. The source told the financial daily that the Indian government has not yet accepted this requirement.""China appears to be seeking an arrangement with the US regarding heavy rare earth magnets and is reluctant to supply without assurance against redirection,"" another source was quoted as saying.Beijing's control extends to 90% of worldwide heavy rare earth magnet production, and it has ceased publishing export data for specific countries.It is attempting to use its commanding position in the rare earth supply chain as a negotiating tool in its trade discussions with Washington.""End-use certification requirements have been implemented,"" a senior government official informed ET. ""We understand that primarily companies are providing these assurances, likely accompanied by commerce ministry verification.""In India, manufacturers of electric vehicles are the primary users of these high-powered magnets, which are vital elements in various advanced sectors including renewable energy, electronics production, aerospace and defence industries.Following the August 31-September 1 Shanghai Cooperation Summit, China has recommenced delivering light rare earth magnets to India. However, the ongoing deficit in heavy rare earth magnet supplies continues to impact the development of motors for bigger electric three-wheelers, automobiles, lorries, and buses across India.These substances are essential in approximately twelve crucial components that are incorporated into electric vehicle motors, as well as systems for detecting vehicle speed and automatic transmission shifting.""There has not been any movement so far as regards to supplies of heavy rare earth magnets despite high-level talks between India and China,"" a senior auto industry executive said. ""Two-wheeler makers have resorted to solutions utilising heavy rare earth-free magnets, but for larger electric vehicles, supplies are still a constraint. Using ferrite magnets or light rare earth magnets ends up impacting efficiency of the vehicles. ""On April 4, China implemented export restrictions on medium and heavy rare earth-related products, citing ""national security"" concerns, following US President Donald Trump's tariff impositions on Beijing. The April directive required exporters to obtain a licence from China's commerce department after receiving an EUC from the purchaser.Under the EUC requirements, purchasers must provide assurance that these materials will not be utilised in the storage, manufacture, production, or processing of weapons of mass destruction or their delivery mechanisms.Despite China's recent resumption of rare earth magnet exports to European and Southeast Asian companies, suppliers to India are still awaiting export licence approvals. During FY25, India's imports of rare earth magnets totalled 870 tonnes, valued at ₹306 crore.",China has sought assurances from India that heavy rare earth magnets they supply will be utilised exclusively for domestic requirements.

Stock market recommendations:Benchmark indices extended their pullback for the second consecutive week amid strong global market momentum. The Reserve Bank of India’s recent dovish stance, aimed at fostering credit growth, provided crucial support to market sentiment. In its latest policy decision, the RBI kept the repo rate steady at 5.5%, signaling a cautious but accommodative approach.After a robust up move, where the Nifty surged over 600 points within just four sessions from 24,588 to 25,220, the index has entered a phase of consolidation over the past two sessions. Moving forward, the Nifty needs to decisively close above the 25,220 marks for a meaningful pullback to take shape. Failing this, the index is likely to continue oscillating within the 25,220 to 24,700 range, driven largely by stock-specific movements ahead of the Q2FY26 earnings season.On the upside, a sustained move above Tuesday’s high of 25,220 would pave the way for further gains towards the 25,400-25,500 levels, where the trendline resistance connecting the major highs of June and September 2025 lies.On the downside, strong support is seen between 24,800 and 24,700, marked by the confluence of the 20-day and 50-day exponential moving averages (EMA) and the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement of the recent rally from 24,588 to 25,220.Key Monitorables Going Forward:Overall, the market appears poised for cautious consolidation, supported by favorable macro factors but awaiting clearer direction from earnings and global cues.Bank Nifty displayed notable relative strength throughout the week, outperforming Nifty as buying momentum returned across major banking stocks post RBI monetary policy meeting. The strong up move in the last 2 weeks reflects renewed bullish sentiment, indicating that the banking sector is regaining leadership. Sustained buying momentum could further strengthen investor confidence and drive additional upside in the coming weeks.Bank Nifty after a 2300 points up-move in just 6 sessions is witnessing consolidation in the last 2 sessions. We expect the index to consolidate in the range of 56,500-55,500 thus forming a base for the next leg of up move.On the higher side a move above Tuesday’s high of 56500 would open further upside towards the all-time high of 57,300-57,600 in the coming weeks.On the downside support is placed at 55,500-55,000 levels being the confluence of the 20- & 50-days EMA and the 61.8% retracement of the last up move (54,227-56,502). We believe bias remains positive and dips should be used as a buying opportunity.Jayaswal Neco Industries (JNIL’s) strong captive iron ore resource base in Chhattisgarh provides a structural advantage in securing raw material supplies, with mining leases valid through 2052–2055 and scalable production potential up to 4 MTPA. Expansion across the value chain, including a 1.5 MTPA pellet plant and a new beneficiation facility, positions the company to capture higher value-added margins and operational efficiencies. The upcoming washery expansion, expected by October 2025, is set to deliver annual cost savings of ₹800–900 million, further improving profitability.In parallel, JNIL’s proactive debt refinancing of ₹23 billion with Tata Capital marks a pivotal balance sheet improvement, lowering borrowing costs from 17.5% to 12.5% and extending repayment tenure to 72 months. This move will enhance cash flow visibility, strengthen liquidity, and improve credit metrics. Collectively, these operational and financial initiatives support a positive outlook on JNIL’s earnings trajectory and reinforce confidence in the company’s long-term value creation potential.The stock has confirmed a breakout from an inverse head and shoulders pattern, decisively moving above its falling trendline resistance.After a phase of prolonged consolidation, it is now breaking out of its trading range, indicating a potential shift in trend.Key supports are placed at ₹240 and ₹225, while on the upside, immediate resistance is seen around ₹300 being the recent range breakout. The breakout is further validated by rising volumes, reinforcing bullish momentum.","According to Bajaj Broking Research, the top stock picks for October 10, 2025 are Jayaswal Neco Industries, and Bank of Baroda. The Reserve Bank of India’s recent dovish stance, aimed at fostering credit growth, provided crucial support to market sentiment.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124442307,imgsize-80346,width-400,resizemode-4/top-stocks-to-buy.jpg"

Tata Motors’ shares fell 6.8% over the past four sessions to touch Rs 689.3 on the BSE on Wednesday, slipping below the Rs 700 mark as investors awaited the record date for the company’s upcoming demerger.The decline comes amid market anticipation of the separation of its commercial and passenger vehicle businesses, alongside the phased restart of production at its UK-based luxury arm, Jaguar Land Rover (JLR), following a cyber incident, according to an ET report.JLR resumed its manufacturing operations from October 8 after a disruption in early September. The company also announced a new financing solution to support supplier cash flows as vehicle production gradually returns to normal.Tata Motors is undertaking a 1:1 demerger that will create two independent listed entities: TML Commercial Vehicles and Tata Motors Passenger Vehicles, which will include JLR. The company has fixed October 14, 2025, as the record date for determining eligible shareholders for the 1:1 share allotment. Under the scheme, shareholders holding one fully paid-up Tata Motors share (face value Rs 2) will receive one fully paid-up TMLCV share of the same face value.In addition, October 10, 2025, is set as the record date for identifying eligible debenture holders whose Non-Convertible Debentures (NCDs) worth Rs 2,300 crore will be transferred to TMLCV as part of the restructuring. Post-demerger, the equity shares of TMLCV are proposed to be listed on both BSE and NSE, subject to regulatory approvals.SAMCO Securities said shareholders holding Tata Motors stock as of the record date will receive shares in both entities at the specified ratio. “The share price of Tata Motors will adjust on the ex-date, October 14, 2025, to reflect the new corporate structure,” the report noted. Once listed, investors will see shares of Tata Motors Passenger Vehicles and TML Commercial Vehicles credited to their demat accounts, though overall portfolio value will remain unchanged initially.Traders in Futures & Options (F&O) and Margin Trading Facility (MTF) will face restrictions from October 8. New F&O or MTF buy positions in Tata Motors cannot be created during this period to prevent sharp volatility, though existing positions can still be managed or squared off. Normal trading will resume once the demerger process concludes.SAMCO Securities advised investors to follow official announcements from Tata Motors and avoid new leveraged positions in F&O or MTF until restrictions are lifted. Shareholders can review their portfolios once both entities are listed to make necessary adjustments.",Tata Motors’ shares fell 6.8% over the past four sessions to touch Rs 689.3 on the BSE on Wednesday.

Investing in PPF? Don’t exceed the Rs 1.5 lakh limit; interest earned on excess contribution will be taken back!,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/investing/investing-in-ppf-dont-exceed-the-rs-1-5-lakh-limit-interest-earned-on-excess-contribution-will-be-taken-back/articleshow/124410677.cms,"The PPF investment limit was last hiked in 2014, when the government increased the maximum annual contribution from Rs 1 lakh to Rs 1.5 lakh.

keep the annual limit in mind when you invest in the PPF.

PPF investment limit : Top things to keep in mind

When you surpass the prescribed limit, the interest earned on the excess contributions may be subject to clawback. Whenever the discrepancy is discovered, any interest earned on the excess amount above the Rs 1.5 lakh limit would be taken back by the Post Office.





The Public Provident Fund (PPF) is a popular and safe investment that gives assured and tax-free returns. At 7.1% tax-free, it offers higher returns than what other fixed income options give. The new rules for taxation of Provident Fund contributions above Rs 2.5 lakh in a year have made it eeen more attractive. ButIn a financial year, an individual can contribute only up to Rs 1.5 lakh to her PPF account. This cap includes both self and minor children’s accounts. If you open a PPF account in your child’s name, the combined contribution to both accounts must not exceed Rs 1.5 lakh in a financial year.While this limit is straightforward, some people invest more in the scheme. They either open multiple PPF accounts in their name or also invest in their minor children’s accounts. But while it might seem harmless, exceeding the Rs 1.5 lakh limit can become a problem later on.The investor may be able to get away with it for several years, but when the discrepancy is finally noticed, it could result in a rude shock. Imagine if the discovery happens when the account matures. The investor will lose the interest on several lakhs of rupees for 15 years. In his attempt to invest in a tax-free instrument and save 30% tax on interest, he might end up losing 100% of the interest!In October 2024, the government clarified rules for irregular PPF accounts. Since all investments are now linked to the PAN of the individual, it is impossible to hide such accounts. All accounts other than the primary PPF account of the individual will be considered irregular and not earn interest. If excess investments have been made in a minor child’s PPF account, the investment will earn 4% Post Office Savings Account (POSA) interest till the minor turns 18 and the account becomes regularised.The PPF investment limit was last hiked in 2014, when the government increased the maximum annual contribution from Rs 1 lakh to Rs 1.5 lakh. A few years ago, the investment limit for the Senior Citizens Saving Scheme was hiked from Rs 15 lakh to Rs 30 lakh per individual, but the PPF limit has remained unchanged. Some investment experts say the limit should be hiked to at least Rs 3 lakh a year to encourage long-term savings and investment, especially for individuals seeking tax-free returns and retirement security.","The Public Provident Fund (PPF) is a popular and safe investment.

But, longterm trend in assets under custody of FPIs remains upward, which has grown from $827 billion to around $907 billion with a 10-year CAGR of over 12%. Beyond scale and participation, what ultimately matters to investors is that India has a strong story. MSCI India has consistently outperformed most other emerging markets over the 6-, 10and 15-year horizons. The outflows, which are there for the last two years, are not really that worrying. FPIs will consider several factors: PE ratio relative to peers. They will look at emerging markets, what is happening in China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Korea, where a lot of flows have gone. Indian valuations are normally at a little bit of a premium. The flows also depend upon how you are looking at the mediumterm and short-term growth story and also geopolitical situation, Federal Reserve’s actions on interest rates. India’s macroeconomic fundamentals are very strong, with 6.5% plus growth this year and going forward. Certainly, the funds will be there where the growth is. I have had extensive outreach.There are a lot of good things about India and also some of the things that we are doing in Sebi.■ It is a very important consideration for us. Our primary market is very active, at this moment, the most active in the world in terms of number of IPOs. That only shows there is a constant stream of domestic money and it is finding good quality papers. The primary market must always remain active both on the equity as well as on the bond side. The daily turnover has doubled over the last five years. It used to be about Rs 50,000 crore per day and now is about Rs 1 lakh crore. But, it still needs to be more in terms of liquidity. One of the ways we are thinking is slightly activating the SLBM (securities lending and borrowing market).■ There are several suggestions on the table, but we will have to look at them. Everyone agrees that we should have a better SLBM market as compared to other jurisdictions.■ We are doing our best. The merchant bankers and the book lead managers, they do their due diligence. The documents are intensively scrutinised. We are also using AI tools to speed up our processing and see that the disclosures are not missing from the document. Our job is also not to do valuation. All we want is all due disclosures are adequately placed and are as per norms. We have really reduced the time to clear the documents and our average time is now pretty competitive.■ We have looked at the SME IPOs and more guardrails have been placed. At the moment, I don’t think we have any more steps in mind. However, as a general matter, we are upgrading our surveillance systems because everything cannot be addressed through regulations and many things have to be addressed through proper surveillance and also database analytics.■ I had said few days back that everyone should not go into derivatives if they have not even done cash investing. If people are falling prey to some finfluencers in the guise of very guaranteed returns, that is distortion of market knowledge. Derivatives are mostly for hedging. Not that the speculation is to be avoided, speculation is part of the market. But the risks must be well understood, especially if you are up and against very high frequency traders. We are cautioning people, we are putting out data to show how people are losing and we are also giving statutory warnings. We have taken several measures, some of which have kicked in. Some of the measures will be kicking up from October, then December. Volumes have come down by about 20%. We will also wait for the next round of data to come in. What steps we are going to take will be in the consultation paper for wider debate before we do anything else on this.■ We are undertaking major changes in the penalty framework for stockbrokers. Uniform penalty structure across exchanges for violation will be the same across exchanges. We are replacing the term penalty with “financial disincentive” for minor procedural violations to remove the stigma on brokers. There is also the introduction of a common reporting mechanism for stockbrokers. Sebi and exchanges have now introduced a technology based common reporting mechanism – Samuhik Prativedan Manch. This allows brokers to submit compliance reports in the platform at one exchange, instead of multiple exchanges where they are registered.■ Technology is important, human beings are important and so is their capacity. All these three things are being looked at in our upgrade of our surveillance. An important task that we have is to increase our surveillance both at the exchange level and also at the Sebi level.■ They’re a very important part of investor protection mandate that Sebi has. We have to educate investors. We are coordinating with all stakeholders so that the messages are amplified. We are going to do more things, such as educate them about portfolios, which can have several asset classes. Our investor survey shows 9.5% households, which means 32 million households today are invested, a very large number is willing to come within the next one year. Which means we have to be adequately able to reach out and prepare for them. In any case, the numbers in India are so high that 134 million unique investors in a few years will double. It is also important to develop a platform and make a protection platform on a systemic basis. Because UPI is ubiquitous. We created this UPI verified handle as a subsystem, which is quite unique.■ We are working comprehensively for inter-regulatory coordination. I met with the RBI governor. We have worked out a system where we highlight issues, we sort it out. We now have a very active coordination with RBI on all matters, whether it is regulations, ease of doing business or FPI registration. We connect on bonds and derivatives. If you have to do bond derivatives, we have not yet there. We are thinking of launching bond derivatives in India.■ Yes, bond derivatives on corporate bonds. Sometime back we brought in electricity derivatives. We have got an electricity derivative market in two exchanges. We are looking at commodity derivatives. In commodity markets, we actually have a lot of potential.■ No, we have no need to review it in India. It is a good system. It has stabilised and there is no need to review it.","Domestic institutional and retail investors have emerged as a strong counterweight to FIIs. India’s macroeconomic fundamentals are very strong, with 6.5% plus growth this year.

MUMBAI: A decade after its launch in India, Swedish fast fashion giant H&M has forayed into the booming local beauty market, widening its play in the country beyond mainstay fashion and home.Popular with Gen Z and millennials for its fashion-forward clothing that comes with a brand tag and is yet affordable, H&M will tap into the same playbook for beauty as it takes on Hindustan Unilever's Lakme, French brand L'Oreal, Reliance's Tira, Nykaa (both Tira and Nykaa have private labels in beauty & makeup) and scores of other homegrown D2C companies in India.H&M can leverage its strong brand equity in fashion to grow the beauty business in India, a market which is ""pivotal"" for the company for its scale, diversity and forward-looking consumer base, said Cathrine Wigzell, global general manager at H&M Beauty.""We bring a trend-driven, inclusive private-label assortment designed to complement our fashion offering-allowing customers to create a complete look from head to toe.

The United States will purchase 11 icebreaking vessels from Finland in a move aimed at bolstering its Arctic maritime capabilities, President Donald Trump announced on Thursday during a meeting with Finnish President Alexander Stubb at the White House.Under the agreement, four vessels will be built in Finland, while seven will be constructed in the United States, with the Finnish side providing expertise and technical assistance.“What you're doing is you're going to be teaching us about the icebreaker business,” Trump told Stubb in the Oval Office. “We need these ships very badly because we have a lot of territory... It’s going to be a great partnership.”The icebreakers, also called Arctic security cutters, will be operated by the US Coast Guard, which has long sought to modernise and expand its aging polar fleet.The announcement marks a deepening of US-Finland industrial and defence cooperation, particularly amid growing strategic interest in the Arctic region due to climate change, increased shipping lanes, and geopolitical competition.Stubb welcomed the collaboration, highlighting Finland’s long-standing shipbuilding expertise in cold-weather operations. The specifics of the timeline and total cost of the deal are expected to be finalised in upcoming bilateral defence and infrastructure discussions.","The United States will purchase 11 icebreaking vessels from Finland in a move aimed at bolstering its Arctic maritime capabilities.

The US directly purchased Argentine pesos on Thursday and finalised a $20 billion currency swap framework with Argentina’s central bank, said treasury secretary Scott Bessent. The move is intended to provide assistance amid the Latin American country’s economic turmoil.In a social media post on X, Bessent wrote, “US Treasury is prepared, immediately, to take whatever exceptional measures are warranted to provide stability to markets,” adding that the treasury department conducted four days of meetings with Argentinian finance minister Luis Caputo in Washington DC to come up with the deal.Bessent emphasised that the swap is not a bailout. He highlighted Argentina’s strong economic fundamentals, including structural changes already underway that are expected to generate significant dollar-denominated exports and foreign exchange reserves.“Argentina faces a moment of acute illiquidity. The international community – including @IMFNews – is unified behind Argentina and its prudent fiscal strategy, but only the United States can act swiftly.And act we will,” Bessent said.He also noted the close coordination between Argentina and the International Monetary Fund. “Argentina’s policies, when anchored on fiscal discipline, are sound. Its exchange rate band remains fit for purpose,” he added. Looking ahead, Bessent said he looks forward to the meeting between President Trump and President Milei on October 14 and to further discussions with Minister Caputo at the IMF Annual Meetings.Despite this, US farmers and Democratic lawmakers have criticised the deal as a bailout of a country that has benefited from soybean sales to China, to the detriment of US farmers.Argentina is one of the biggest economies in Latin America and the largest borrower from the International Monetary Fund, with total outstanding credit of $41.8 billion as of August 31.The offer of financial help comes as Trump has frequently promoted his “America First” agenda. Critics contend that the planned intervention is a way to reward a personal friend of Trump’s who is facing a critical midterm election next month.Caputo was in Washington last week for talks with Bessent about the swap line. Following the announcement, Milei celebrated it on social media, hailing his economy minister, Luis Caputo, as “far and away, the best Minister of Economy in all of Argentine history…!!!”Argentina’s deregulation minister, Federico Sturzenegger, also congratulated C ap uto and the rest of the economic team, saying: “Let’s keep working so that our children want to stay and live in Argentina,” and adding a pitch to voters to support Milei in the crucial midterm elections later this month, reported AP.",US Secretary of Treasury Scott Bessent announced a $20 billion currency swap with Argentina.

The average long-term mortgage rate in the US fell to 6.3% this week, returning to its lowest level in about a year, mortgage buyer Freddie Mac said on Thursday. The rate on a 30-year fixed loan edged down from 6.34% last week, while a year ago it averaged 6.32%.Rates on 15-year fixed mortgages, often used for refinancing, also eased, slipping to 5.53% from 5.55% last week. A year ago, the 15-year rate stood at 5.41%, AP reported.Mortgage rates typically follow the 10-year Treasury yield, which guides lenders on home loan pricing. The 10-year yield was at 4.13% at midday Thursday, up from 4.09% last week, after trending higher from 4.02% on September 11.The drop in mortgage rates comes after weeks of easing in the lead-up to the Federal Reserve’s first interest rate cut in a year last month amid concerns over the US job market. Fed Chair Jerome Powell has signalled caution on further rate cuts, contrasting with some Fed committee members appointed by President Donald Trump who advocate faster reductions.Experts note that even if the Fed lowers short-term rates further, mortgage rates may not continue to fall. After the Fed’s rate cuts last year, mortgage rates initially ticked higher, eventually surpassing 7% in January this year.","The average long-term mortgage rate in the US fell to 6.3% this week, returning to its lowest level in about a year.

Elon Musk pay package: Tesla CEO could earn billions without achieving key targets; here’s what experts say,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/elon-musk-pay-package-tesla-ceo-could-earn-billions-without-major-breakthroughs-heres-what-experts-say/articleshow/124420417.cms,"Vehicle and product goals may be easier than they appear

Payouts for modest targets could reach billions

Profit goals remain the toughest hurdle





Elon Musk could claim tens of billions of dollars from Tesla’s record-setting executive pay package without meeting most of the “Mars-shot” goals set by the board, according to a Reuters analysis of his performance criteria and expert review.The September-approved package offers Musk up to $878 billion in stock over 10 years if he achieves ambitious targets. Tesla’s board said Musk must “completely transform Tesla and society as we know it” in robotics, autonomous driving, stock value, and profits, adding he would receive “zero” unless these goals are met.Yet, Reuters report found that Musk could collect more than $50 billion by achieving a few of the board’s easier goals, which would not necessarily transform Tesla’s products or operations. Even hitting just two of the simplest targets along with modest stock growth could net $26 billion—more than the combined lifetime pay of the next eight highest-paid CEOs, including Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg, Oracle’s Larry Ellison, Apple’s Tim Cook, and Nvidia’s Jensen Huang, according to research firm Equilar.Automotive experts told Reuters that Musk’s vehicle sales targets are relatively easy. Selling 1.2 million cars a year over the next decade, assuming Tesla’s market value grows from $1.4 trillion today to $2 trillion by 2035, would earn him $8.2 billion in stock—well under long-term market-average growth and half a million fewer cars than Tesla sold in 2024.Other product-development targets are written in vague terms that could allow large payouts without substantially boosting profits, six robotics and autonomous-driving experts told Reuters.One goal requires 10 million subscriptions to Tesla’s “Full Self-Driving” software, which cannot drive fully autonomously and only requires an “advanced driving system.” William Widen, a University of Miami law professor specialising in autonomous driving, called the term “made-up” with no industry-standard definition. Experts said the target could be easily met by reducing the subscription price, currently $8,000 upfront or $99 a month.Another goal requires one million robotaxis operating “without a human driver in the vehicle.” Four autonomous-vehicle experts told Reuters this could be interpreted to allow remote human control or a passenger-seat operator, as Tesla does in its small-scale Austin test.A third target sets one million robots—likely referring to Tesla’s Optimus humanoid project—but the goal does not specify “humanoid” and defines “bot” broadly as “any robot or other physical product with mobility using artificial intelligence,” two robotics experts said. Christian Rokseth, an analyst at Humanoid.guide, called it a “totally vague formulation.”Achieving any two product goals in a decade, alongside a $2.5 trillion valuation, would pay Musk $26.4 billion in stock. Completing three goals and a $3 trillion valuation could deliver $54.6 billion—without necessarily producing driverless Teslas, the company’s signature promise.Gene Munster, managing partner at Tesla investor Deepwater Asset Management, told Reuters that investors would ultimately hold Musk accountable for delivering transformational products. “If people start smelling there’s something goofy here, he’s in trouble,” he said.The Tesla board described Musk as “motivated by more than just conventional forms of compensation” and the only person capable of transforming the company into an AI leader. The board added that during negotiations, Musk raised the possibility of “prioritising other ventures” if they could not agree on compensation.Corporate governance experts said the board is taking a major risk by tying Tesla’s future to a single executive. Wei Jiang, vice dean at Emory University’s business school, said the board has granted Musk a “monopoly” on Tesla’s top job, noting that good governance requires a competitive market for CEOs.The hardest performance targets for Musk involve profit. The board set eight profit goals between $50 billion and $400 billion in earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortisation, compared with Tesla’s $16.6 billion earnings in 2024.Tesla’s EV business, which accounts for almost all revenue, is facing strong competition and aging models, while the Cybertruck has struggled. Under the compensation structure, Musk could still earn massive stock payouts without hitting any profit target. Every goal paired with a market-value increase offers the same 1% stock award, meaning payouts for easy vehicle and subscription targets are equivalent to meeting ambitious profit targets.Tesla’s valuation goals could also be relatively attainable. Shares could reach $2 trillion if they grow 6.4% annually over the next decade—a slower pace than the S&P 500’s 8.5% long-term average and less than half of the Nasdaq’s 13.2%. Seth Goldstein, a Morningstar analyst tracking Tesla, said the valuation could reach $3 trillion or more with market-average performance, but added that much of the value is based on “future products that don’t exist today. ”Kevin Murphy, a University of Southern California finance professor and Tesla expert witness, told Reuters that vehicle sales and $2 trillion valuation targets “aren’t much of a stretch,” but achieving them alone would not satisfy shareholders. “Shareholders have focused on the hardest goals and biggest payouts because they believe Musk—and only Musk—can hit them. Is it worth it? Shareholders seem to think so,” he said.","Tesla’s board said Musk must “completely transform Tesla and society as we know it’ in robotics, autonomous driving, stock value, and profits.

All work and no pay: US govt shutdown hits federal workers; forced to apply for loans to meet daily needs,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/all-work-and-no-pay-us-govt-shutdown-hits-federal-workers-forced-to-apply-for-loans-to-meet-daily-needs/articleshow/124406714.cms,"All work and no pay

‘Bridging the gap’

Struggle with mortgage





US federal workers have begun to feel the heat of government shutdown as it enters its second week, as many have resorted to even taking loans to cover everyday expenses.Since October 1, hundreds of thousands of federal employees have been furloughed, while others deemed essential, including some military personnel, must work without pay.""We kind of feel like we're like a bargaining chip to an extent,"" a long-serving US Air Force employee told AFP. ""We're not getting paid because people in DC who are getting paid can't get on the same page.""""Not only are we working without pay, we're actually doing more without pay, because our civilian teammates have all gone home on furlough,"" he added. ""That's not good for troop morale.""The first grave signs of the shutdown’s impact will be felt next week, when federal employees start seeing their paychecks affected. If no deal is reached by the end of the month, they could receive nothing in the following paycheck.""It's very stressful,"" said Marilyn Richards, a 46-year-old Air Force and Navy veteran in Missouri, who has been furloughed from her administrative support role at a federal agency.Richards, the main breadwinner in her household, explained the financial pressure the shutdown is causing. ""For most of us who live paycheck to paycheck, you're counting on your next paycheck to continue to keep the lights on,"" she told AFP.""And that's what I do.""The uncertainty caused by the shutdown has led some federal workers to turn to credit unions offering paycheck protection programmes.The Navy Federal Credit Union, which provided around 19,000 loans totalling more than $50 million during the 2018-2019 shutdown, has already begun seeing applications this time, according to a spokesperson.These loans help federal workers get through a few weeks without pay and 'bridge the gap' until the shutdown ends and back pay is received, Haleigh Laverty, a spokesperson for the Defense Credit Union Council, told AFP.Many credit unions are offering short-term, interest-free loans of a few thousand dollars for periods ranging from 90 days to six months. This support helps protect both employees and their credit scores.Among them is the Cobalt Credit Union in Nebraska, which serves around 120,000 members connected to Offutt Air Force Base, home to the US Strategic Command.""We still have active duty and a lot of essential positions on the base that have to report due to missions all over the world,"" Cobalt Credit Union president and CEO Robin Larson said. The union has helped thousands through past shutdowns and has already received multiple loan applications since October 1.While federal workers are hardest hit, the shutdown could also affect the private sector. Mortgage brokers warn that lending may slow down, and crucial services like flood insurance could be disrupted in coastal areas, forcing borrowers to turn to costlier private options.Alex St Pierre, a mortgage broker in Charleston, South Carolina, explained that government workers looking for a mortgage face additional pressures, including the threat of dismissal and delays to identity verification checks while their departments are closed.","US federal workers have begun to feel the heat of government shutdown as it enters its second week.

The global economy is proving more resilient than expected despite major shocks such as President Donald Trump’s sweeping tariffs, but International Monetary Fund Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva has warned that this strength may not last.“Buckle up,” Georgieva said during a speech at the Milken Institute on Wednesday, AP reported. “Uncertainty is the new normal and it is here to stay.”Her remarks came as gold prices hit a record $4,000 an ounce, reflecting investor anxiety over a weaker dollar, rising geopolitical tensions, and the policy outlook ahead of next week’s IMF and World Bank annual meetings in Washington. Trump’s trade penalties are expected to dominate discussions among global finance ministers and central bankers.The IMF currently forecasts global growth at 3% for the year. Georgieva credited strong policy responses, private sector adaptability, and less severe tariff impacts than initially feared for keeping growth steady.“But before anyone heaves a big sigh of relief, please hear this: Global resilience has not yet been fully tested. And there are worrying signs the test may come. Just look at the surging global demand for gold,” she cautioned.Discussing Trump’s tariffs, Georgieva warned that “the full effect is still to unfold.” She said US margin compression could “give way to more price pass-through, raising inflation with implications for monetary policy and growth.”The Republican administration has imposed import taxes on nearly all major US trading partners — including Canada, Mexico, Brazil, China, and even smaller economies such as Lesotho. “We’re the king of being screwed by tariffs,” Trump remarked Tuesday during a meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney.While the US has announced new trade frameworks with nations such as the United Kingdom and Vietnam, the tariffs have triggered global uncertainty. “Elsewhere, a flood of goods previously destined for the US market could trigger a second round of tariff hikes,” Georgieva said.Adding to the policy uncertainty, the Supreme Court is scheduled next month to hear arguments on whether Trump has the authority to impose certain tariffs under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act.Georgieva’s address also touched on social and demographic challenges, warning of deepening youth frustration worldwide. “The young are taking their disappointment to the streets from Lima to Rabat, from Paris to Nairobi, from Kathmandu to Jakarta — all are demanding better opportunities,” she said. “And here in the US, the chances of growing up to earn more than your parents keeps falling — and here too, discontent has been evident. ”She called for structural reforms to promote internal trade in Asia, business-friendly policies in Africa, and greater competitiveness in Europe. For the United States, Georgieva urged action to curb federal debt and boost household savings.According to the Treasury Department, the federal debt has surged from $380 billion in 1925 to $37.64 trillion in 2025. The Congressional Budget Office estimated in July that Trump’s new tax and spending law would add $3.4 trillion more by 2034.The IMF, a 191-member global lender, seeks to foster financial stability, sustainable growth, and poverty reduction worldwide.","IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva says global economy is proving more resilient than expected despite major shocks such as President Donald Trump’s sweeping tariffs.

Soybeans are new rare earths: Xi hits Trump where it hurts,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/why-china-is-not-buying-us-soybeans-donald-trump-xi-jinping-us-china-trade-war-soybeans-are-new-rare-earths/articleshow/124388607.cms,"AI image for representation only.

TL:DR: Driving the news

Trump Aide Exposes American Dependency On China For Critical Minerals Crucial For Weapons | Watch

“The Soybean Farmers of our Country are being hurt because China is, for ‘negotiating’ reasons only, not buying,” Trump posted on Truth Social.

“Soybeans will be a major topic of discussion.”

Why it matters

Soybeans are more than just beans - they’re America’s No. 1 food export, a $60 billion industry that underpins much of the rural economy.

This year, the US is sitting on a record crop with nowhere to sell it.

China buys about 61% of the world’s traded soybeans, making it irreplaceable as a buyer.

This year? China has bought zero soybeans from the current US harvest, down from $12.6 billion in purchases last year.

The shift is part of a broader trade chess match, as Beijing flexes economic muscle in response to Trump’s renewed tariffs.

“US soybeans now are not that important to China,” wrote Lu Ting, chief China economist at Nomura Holdings. “That’s why Beijing can afford to use the import ban as a bargaining tool.”

Moreover, Trump tariffs have raised costs for fertilizer and equipment, squeezing profit margins.

Farmers across the Midwest are storing crops, delaying sales, and watching futures markets sag. “There’s no incentive to sell right now,” Morey Hill, Iowa soybean grower, told WSJ. If a deal with China isn’t reached soon, Hill said, the soybean market “might be a bloodbath.”

US farmers face a double blow - higher expenses and fewer buyers.

Between the lines: The rare earths playbook

Global chessboard: China’s leverage

Bought up Brazil’s entire soy supply for the year.

Secured Argentine beans during a brief export tax holiday.

Blocked US beans just in time to pressure Trump.

Beijing knows American farmers are Trump’s base - and sees them as leverage. That pressure is already working.

“It’s unfortunate the Chinese leadership has decided to use American soybean farmers as a pawn in the trade negotiations,” said treasury secretary Scott Bessent, who himself owns farmland in North Dakota.

Gabriel Wildau of Teneo called soybeans “the lowest-hanging fruit” for a trade win - but warned: if the US and China can’t agree on soy, good luck negotiating TikTok, Taiwan, or semiconductors.

Bailouts and band-aids

Trump has promised help. Again.

“I’m going to do some farm stuff this week,” he said at the White House, teasing an aid package that-if history is any guide-could run between $10 billion and $50 billion. In 2019 and 2020, farmers received more than $45 billion in federal support, much of it in response to earlier trade wars and pandemic shocks.

But many farmers aren’t eager for more checks from Washington.

“All farmers are proud of what they do and they don’t like handouts,” Iowa’s Robb Ewoldt told AP. “We’d rather make it with our own two hands.”

Still, the math doesn’t lie. Farming equipment, fertilizer, and fuel costs have soared, while crop prices have tanked. According to projections from North Dakota State University’s Agricultural Risk Policy Center, US row crop farmers stand to lose up to $45 billion this year alone-before any government support.

With harvest season underway and the federal government paralyzed by a shutdown, aid payments are delayed. And even if they arrive, they won’t restore lost markets.

What's next





China, once the biggest buyer of American soybeans, hasn’t booked a single purchase from this year’s US harvest - sending prices tumbling and farmers into panic. The abrupt halt mirrors Beijing's previous use of rare earth exports as leverage in trade wars. Now, it's soybeans.US President Donald Trump said he’ll confront Chinese President Xi Jinping about the freeze at the upcoming Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in South Korea later this month.Meanwhile, US farmers, many of whom backed Trump in 2024, are warning of a ""bloodbath"" in rural America if the situation doesn't change fast.This isn't just about soy. It’s a strategic repeat of what China did with rare earth minerals earlier this year.Earlier this year, Beijing used its dominance of rare earth exports-a critical input for electric vehicles, military hardware, and semiconductors-as a pressure point in talks with the Trump administration over export controls.Trump eased off.Now, Beijing is doing the same with soybeans, just as harvest begins. “Beijing’s new bargaining chip is an import ban on US soybean,” Nomura’s Lu Ting wrote, according to a Bloomberg report.While soybeans may lack the exotic appeal of rare earths, they are a critical input for China’s massive hog and poultry industry. But as trade tensions escalate, China has been stocking up from South America. In September alone, it bought 2 million tons of soy from Argentina.“I always thought I would farm till they threw dirt on top of me,” Dean Buchholz, who’s farming his last crop this year, told the WSJ. He’s quitting not because of age, but because the economics no longer add up. “I can’t make it work to where it would be practical to keep going without me spending a boatload of money and keep putting myself into more debt.”""The frustration is overwhelming,"" said Caleb Ragland, 39, a Kentucky farmer and president of the American Soybean Association.And the timing is brutal. More than half of US soybean exports typically happen between October and December, just after harvest. China is holding off until Brazil’s crop is ready in February.Farmers are increasingly cynical. “We knew what Trump would do,” said Sarah Taber, a North Carolina crop scientist and blogger. “And a lot of farmers just voted for him anyway. If no deal is struck by December, US soy could miss the entire global buying window.China has played its cards well:In the 21st-century global economy, leverage doesn’t always come in the form of missiles or microchips. Sometimes it looks like a soybean. And in the hands of a strategic rival, even a humble crop can become a diplomatic weapon.China knows what it’s doing. It’s punishing Trump where he’s politically vulnerable, economically exposed, and slow to react. And it’s doing so at a moment when American farmers are too broke to fight, and too proud to ask for help.Whether Trump strikes a soybean deal at APEC or not, the damage is done. The United States built its food exports on predictability. Now, that predictability has been replaced by politics-and a bitter harvest no one wanted.(With inputs from agencies)","Soybeans are America's No. 1 food export, a $60 billion industry that underpins much of the rural economy.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground.Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change, too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

Space sector start-up Sisir Radar to develop SAR on L/P band SAR,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/space-sector-start-up-sisir-radar-to-develop-sar-on-l/p-band-sar/articleshow/104558111.cms,"CHENNAI: Space sector startup, Sisir Radar Private Ltd has hit success at the prestigious iDEX DefSpace Challenge with its projects for development of “L/P band Continuous Wave SAR (synthetic aperture radar) payload for LEO Small Satellites” and “Unfurlable, Electronically Steering Antenna for L/P band SAR payload” for Indian Air Force (IAF), said a top company official.The company is promoted by former Director at the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) Tapan Misra and the brains behind the Indian space agency’s RISAT series of SAR satellites as well as the Dual Frequency SAR on the Chandrayaan 2 orbiter that is currently circling the moon.""A grant of Rs 3 crore is also there for development of the products,"" Misra told IANS.Synthetic Aperture Radar or SAR is a special kind of imaging radar technology that can provide extremely accurate high resolution imagery of the terrain through clouds, smoke and dust even in pitch dark conditions. SAR imagery provides much higher resolution than other forms of remote sensing technology such as hyperspectral and multispectral. SAR is a critical technology for strategic reconnaissance and planning as well as for disaster management.According to Misra, winning the challenge in just over a year of floating the company is a major booster.He said L and P band SAR have an advantage over other frequencies (like X band) when it comes to penetration capabilities through rain, clouds, foliage and vegetation in a tropical country like India, and underground penetration capabilities in dry terrain.Continuing further, he said the L band SAR will provide 1 metre resolution, spotlight resolution in Stripmap mode. The current industry standard is 5-10 metre in L band. Misra said both the L and P band will operate simultaneously from a satellite borne SAR. Recently, Sisir Radar successfully developed and tested the world’s highest resolution L-Band SAR fitted on a drone. With 0.2 metre resolution, this is by far the highest L band SAR in the world, he said.","Space sector startup, Sisir Radar Private Ltd has hit success at the prestigious iDEX DefSpace Challenge.

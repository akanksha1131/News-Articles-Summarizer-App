US President Donald Trump said that he may bar ExxonMobil from operating in Venezuela, criticising the oil giant after its leadership questioned the viability of investing in the country after the capture of former president Nicolas Maduro by US forces.Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One on Sunday as he departed West Palm Beach, Florida, Trump said he was unhappy with the company’s stance. “I didn’t like Exxon’s response,” he said. “They’re playing too cute.”The remarks came days after Trump met oil executives on Friday in an effort to calm industry concerns about Venezuela. During the meeting, he told companies that any engagement would be handled directly with the United States rather than through the Venezuelan government. However, not all executives were reassured.Darren Woods, chief executive of ExxonMobil, described the current situation in stark terms. “If we look at the commercial constructs and frameworks in place today in Venezuela, today it’s uninvestable,” he said.On the same day, Trump also signed an executive order aimed at protecting Venezuelan oil revenues from being used in judicial proceedings. The order, released publicly on Saturday, warned that allowing such funds to be seized could “undermine critical US efforts to ensure economic and political stability in Venezuela.”The country has long faced state asset seizures, US sanctions and prolonged political uncertainty.Securing investment from US oil companies to help rebuild Venezuela’s infrastructure has become a key objective of the Trump administration following Maduro’s capture.The White House has presented the approach as an economic strategy, with Trump already having seized tankers transporting Venezuelan oil, announced that the US is taking control of the sale of 30 million to 50 million barrels of previously sanctioned crude, and stated plans to oversee those sales globally on an indefinite basis.",Trump criticises ExxonMobil after its leadership questioned the viability of investing in the country.

Maduro Seized, Caracas Explodes, Armed Loyalists Mobilise: Venezuelans Warn Trump On Oil Grab

US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent hinted at possible easing of sanctions on Venezuela’s oil exports in the next week, after the arrest of Venezuela President Nicolas Maduro by US forces. The US Treasury is also scheduled to hold discussions with the heads of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank on the latter’s re-engagement with Venezuela with the aim of releasing close to $5 billion in Venezuelan funds locked away in foreign banks.In a Friday interview with Reuters at a Winnebago Industries facility, Bessent explained the Treasury's focus on helping Venezuela access its oil revenues. ""We're de-sanctioning the oil that's going to be sold,"" he said, adding that they're working on ways to help return oil sale proceeds to Venezuela for government operations and public benefit. Explaining the Treasury’s sanctions review, he said, “How can we help that get back into Venezuela, to run the government, run the security services and get it to the Venezuelan people?”President Donald Trump has already taken action by signing an executive order that protects Venezuelan oil revenue in US Treasury accounts from courts and creditors and to safeguard funds for Venezuela's future ""peace, prosperity and stability.""The Treasury's plans include converting Venezuela's IMF Special Drawing Rights, worth about $4.9 billion, into dollars for reconstruction efforts. This mirrors a similar strategy used with Argentina last year, where the Treasury backed a $20 billion swap line to help stabilize their economy.The development marks a significant shift in US-Venezuela relations. The IMF hasn't engaged with Venezuela for over 20 years, with their last formal assessment done in 2004. Venezuela's last interaction with the World Bank was in 2007, when then-leader Hugo Chavez declared independence from Washington's funding.Bessent expects smaller private companies to quickly return to Venezuela's oil sector, despite some major oil companies showing hesitation. ""I think it's going to be the typical progression where the private companies can move quickly and will come in very quickly,"" he said. He also noted that Chevron, which has maintained a presence in Venezuela, is likely to increase its commitment.The Treasury Secretary also suggested a role for the US Export-Import Bank in supporting Venezuela's oil sector financing, echoing previous statements from US Energy Secretary Chris Wright.",US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent hinted at possible easing of sanctions on Venezuela’s oil exports in the next week.

‘On its way to US’: Trump makes big claim on Venezuela oil; says ‘yes’ to 50 million barrels worth $4.2bn,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/on-its-way-to-us-trump-makes-big-claim-on-venezuela-oil-says-yes-to-50-million-barrels-worth-4-2bn/articleshow/126474150.cms,"Oil Tankers Flip Trump’s Game? Venezuela’s ‘Dark Mode’ Fleet TRICKS US, Then Comes Back. Here’s Why

Washington is working “along really well” with Venezuela, US President Donald Trump said on Sunday (local time), pointing to oil shipments from the country. Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One, Trump was talking about US's approach towards the new leadership in Caracas after Nicolas Maduro was captured by American forces. “Venezuela is really working out well. We're working along really well with the leadership, and we'll see how it all works out,” he said.The US President further added that the acting President of Venezuela, Delcy Rodriguez, asked US if they could ""take 50 million barrels of oil."" ""I said, 'yes, we can' — that's $4.2 billion, and it's on its way right now to the United States,” Trump further added highlighting the scale of the deal.This comes as the Trump administration is pushingimed at claiming control over Venezuelan oil production and sales. Earlier this week, the president invited oil executives to the White House and pressed them to move quickly into Venezuela, saying the administration was seeking around $100 billion in private investment to revive the country’s oil industry and fully tap its large reserves.Trump said that Washington had seized tankers carrying Venezuelan oil and would now take over the sale of between 30 million and 50 million barrels that had previously been under sanctions, with the US controlling sales globally for an indefinite period.In the meeting with oil industry leaders, Trump told executives, “You have total safety.” “You’re dealing with us directly and not dealing with Venezuela at all. We don’t want you to deal with Venezuela.”He stressed that the expected investments would come from private companies rather than public funds. “Our giant oil companies will be spending at least $100 billion of their money, not the government’s money. They don’t need government money. But they need government protection,"" Trump said.According to the president, security assurances would be provided through cooperation with Venezuelan leaders and their people, rather than the deployment of US troops, although he added that companies would “bring over some security.”Trump also acknowledged the risks involved, noting that oil executives were accustomed to operating in challenging environments, even as Venezuela remains vulnerable to economic collapse.The White House meeting came shortly after US forces seized a fifth tanker in the past month linked to Venezuelan oil. The seizure reflected the administration’s determination to take control of Venezuela’s oil exports, refining and production, signalling continued US involvement in the sector as it pushes for firm investment commitments from private companies.","US President Donald Trump says Washington is working ""along really well"" with Venezuela.

"Federal Reserve Chair Powell says DOJ has subpoenaed central bank, threatens criminal indictment",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/federal-reserve-chair-powell-says-doj-has-subpoenaed-central-bank-threatens-criminal-indictment/articleshow/126474005.cms,"Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said Sunday the Department of Justice has served the central bank with subpoenas and threatened it with a criminal indictment over his testimony this summer about the Fed's building renovations.The move represents an unprecedented escalation in President Donald Trump's battle with the Fed, an independent agency he has repeatedly attacked for not cutting its key interest rate as quickly as Trump prefers. The subpoena relates to his testimony before the Senate Banking Committee in June, Powell said, regarding the Fed's $2.5 billion renovation of two office buildings, a project that Trump criticized as excessive.Powell on Sunday cast off what has up to this point been a restrained approach to Trump's criticisms and personal insults, which he has mostly ignored. Instead, Powell issued a video statement in which he bluntly characterized the threat of criminal charges as simple ""pretexts"" to undermine the Fed's independence when it comes to setting interest rates.""This is about whether the Fed will be able to continue to set interest rates based on evidence and economic conditions - or whether instead monetary policy will be directed by political pressure or intimidation,"" Powell said.It's a sharp departure from the Fed's understated response to Trump this year. The central bank has attempted to placate the administration by dialing back some policies, such as efforts to consider the impact of climate change on the banking system, that the administration clearly opposed.In a brief interview with NBC News Sunday, Trump insisted he didn't know about the investigation into Powell. When asked if the investigation is intended to pressure Powell on rates, Trump said, ""No. I wouldn't even think of doing it that way.""Powell's term as chair ends in May, and Trump administration officials have signaled that he could name a potential replacement this month. Trump has also sought to fire Fed governor Lisa Cook, an unprecedented step, though she has sued to keep her job and courts have ruled she can remain in her seat while the case plays out. The Supreme Court will hear arguments in that case Jan. 21.At the Senate Banking Committee hearing in June, Chairman Tim Scott, a Republican from South Carolina, said the Fed's building renovation included ""rooftop terraces, custom elevators that open into VIP dining rooms, white marble finishes, and even a private art collection.""Powell disputed those details in his testimony, saying ""there's no new marble. ... there are no special elevators"" and added that some items are ""not in the current plan."" In July, Russell Vought, director of the Office of Management and Budget, said in a letter to Powell that his testimony ""raises serious questions about the project's compliance"" with previous plans approved by a planning commission.Still, later that month, Trump visted the building site and, while standing next to Powell, overstated the cost of the renovation. Later that day, Trump, speaking to reporters, downplayed any concerns with the renovation. He said, ""they have to get it done"" and added, ""Look, there's always Monday morning quarterbacks. I don't want to be that. I want to help them get it finished.""When asked if it was a firing offense, Trump said, ""I don't want to put that in this category.""The Justice Department in a statement Sunday said it can't comment on any particular case, but added that Attorney General Pam Bondi ""has instructed her US Attorneys to prioritize investigating any abuse of tax payer dollars.""Timothy Lauer, a spokesperson for U.S. Attorney Jeanine Pirro's office, said they don't comment on ongoing investigations.With the subpoenas, Powell becomes the latest perceived adversary of the president to face a criminal investigation by the Trump administration's Justice Department. Trump himself has urged prosecutions of his political opponents, obliterating institutional guardrails for a Justice Department that for generations has taken care to make investigative and prosecutorial decisions independent of the White House.The potential indictment has already drawn concern from one Republican senator, who said he'll oppose any future nominee to the central bank, including any replacement for Powell, until ""this legal matter is fully resolved.""""If there were any remaining doubt whether advisers within the Trump Administration are actively pushing to end the independence of the Federal Reserve, there should now be none,"" said North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis, who sits on the Banking Committee, which oversees Fed nominations. ""It is now the independence and credibility of the Department of Justice that are in question.""",Jerome Powell says the Justice Department has served the Fed with subpoenas.

Pollution pangs: Respiratory medicine sales surge,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/pollution-pangs-respiratory-medicine-sales-surge/articleshow/126473155.cms,".

NEW DELHI: Our battle with toxic air across cities is showing up sharply in medical bills. Sales of respiratory medicines, including anti-allergics and anti-asthma therapies, surged past Rs 1,950 crore in Dec 2025, the highest monthly level ever, signalling a troubling escalation in pollution-linked illnesses. The Dec sales were 10% higher than the corresponding month in 2024, and over 18% more compared with 2023, figures culled from market research firm Pharmarack showed, indicating a consistent increase each year.For the Oct-Dec quarter, the period when pollution typically peaks, sales rose in tandem, by 14% year-on-year over 2024, and by 8% over 2023.During the quarter, respiratory therapy sales crossed Rs 5,620 crore, a rise of 17% over the previous quarter. A majority under this therapy - nearly Rs 3,500 crore - was contributed by anti-asthma and COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) medication.Further, Foracort, the medication used for asthma and respiratory issues, is among the top selling drugs during the winter months, mirroring the trend. In Dec, it was the second largest selling drug with sales of Rs 90 crore, following weight-loss therapy, Mounjaro.Overall, the domestic pharma market is estimated at Rs 2.4 lakh crore annually.Exposure to air pollution can aggravate asthma and respiratory infections, and can even lead to serious issues like chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, medical experts say.""With rise in suspended particles in the air, allergic rhinitis and bronchitis patients increase by about 60% in the daily outpatient (department). Use of masks and air purifiers does help to a great extent especially in susceptible individuals. As far as treatment is considered, use of steroid inhalers as well as anti-allergics forms the backbone,"" Amitabh Malik, head of department - ENT, Paras Health in Gurgaon, told TOI.Other widely-used therapies during these months include Augmentin (marketed by GSK Pharma) and Paracetamol (pain and fever management).A GSK Pharma India executive said, ""The Oct to Feb period typically coincides with a seasonal rise in upper respiratory infections. This leads to increased demand for related medications during these months.

'No Call From PM Modi': Trump Aide Lutnick's Shocker On India-US Trade Deal Amid Tariff Threats

NEW DELHI: Days after govt rejected US commerce secretary Howard Lutnick's claims, commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal Sunday said that stakeholders should have trust in India, instead of relying on statements from overseas.""Trade deal is not negotiated in media. Trust India, don't trust foreign statements. Have trust in your country, your motherland, India,"" he said at an event when asked about the state of play on the bilateral trade deal.Last week, Lutnick had claimed that the India-US trade deal, which has been in the works since last Feb, did not go through as PM Narendra Modi did not call US President Donald Trump, unlike leaders from some other countries which managed to get lower tariffs as against 50% slapped on India.The comment had drawn a strong rebuttal from the ministry of external affairs, which said that the comments on the ""circumstances"" were ""not accurate"", while reiterating that India was interested in a mutually beneficial bilateral trade deal.While five rounds of talks have been held and India has submitted a revised proposal, indicating its willingness to ""significantly open up"", while protecting its sensitive sectors such as agriculture, dairy and MSMEs, Washington has not agreed to the offer and there is a stalemate of sorts.Periodically, Trump has raised the issue of Russian oil imports even as India has maintained that it will pursue policies and opt for purchases that are in the best interests of its consumers, while openly asserting its willingness for more energy purchases from the US."," commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal Sunday said that stakeholders should have trust in India, instead of relying on statements from overseas.

NEW DELHI: In an effort to eliminate illegal activity in the digital asset market, India's Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) has unveiled stringent new anti-money laundering (AML) and know your customer (KYC) protocols for cryptocurrency exchanges, including mandatory liveness detection and geographical tracking during the onboarding process.The updated guidelines, issued on Jan 8, classify crypto exchanges as Virtual Digital Asset (VDA) service providers who will now have to do more than just allow simple document uploads.Under the new rules, users must take a ""live selfie"" using software that verifies their presence, typically through eye-blinking or head movement. The measure helps prevent the use of static photos or deepfakes.Exchanges must record the exact latitude and longitude, date, timestamp, and IP address from which a user starts creating an account. The ""penny-drop"" method, which involves processing a nominal Re 1 transaction to confirm that the bank account is active and belongs to the registrant, is required.In addition to a Permanent Account Number (PAN), users must provide a secondary ID such as a Passport, Aadhaar or a Voter ID, along with an OTP verification for the email ID and phone number.The FIU, which operates under the Union finance ministry, is taking a tough stance against tools meant to conceal the paper trail of crypto wealth.The new guidelines aim to ""strongly discourage"" Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) and Initial Token Offerings (ITOs) due to their lack of economic justification and high risk. The FIU is the single-point regulator for cryptocurrency exchanges (reporting entities or VDA service providers) operating in India under the provisions of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA).All such exchanges have to register with the FIU as reporting entities and submit regular reports on suspicious transactions and maintain records of their clients (customers) to identify and combat money laundering, terrorist financing and proliferation financing risks associated with crypto assets, which India has not identified as a legal tender but are taxed under the Income-Tax law. The exchanges have been asked to do a KYC updation for ""high-risk"" clients every six months and for all others annually.","India's Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) has unveiled stringent new anti-money laundering (AML) protocols for cryptocurrency exchanges.

India’s Energy Security Strategy

What’s The Road Ahead For India’s Energy Security?

Oil is called black gold - and for a reason - it’s the fuel that drives economic growth and oil security is increasingly becoming crucial in a world fraught with geopolitical uncertainties and possibilities of supply shocks. India imports over 85% of its crude oil needs - and a rise in crude oil prices or uncertainty in supply chains can feed negatively into the economic growth engine.Recent geopolitical tensions - possible blocking of the Strait of Hormuz, US moves in Venezuela which has the highest proven oil reserves in the world, and the Donald Trump administration’s tariffs on India for its crude imports from Russia all highlight the need for India to step up focus on its energy security.An SBI Research report last year - at the time of the Iran-Israel conflict - estimated that every $10 per bbl increase in crude oil prices can lead to 25-35 bps increase in CPI inflation and 20-30 bps decline in real GDP growth. However, SBI expects oil prices to soften this year, which will boost growth. Trump has been pressuring India to stop procuring crude from Russia and has even sanctioned two major Russian firms. A bill proposing 500% tariffs on countries buying Russian oil has also got a nod from the American President and will be put up for a vote in the Senate soon.India’s crude oil import basket has undergone a clear and measurable shift over the past five years, according to data from Kpler, a global real-time data and analytics provider. In 2021, India’s sourcing was still heavily dominated by the Middle East. By 2023, the transformation was clearly visible in the data. Russia became India’s largest crude supplier, accounting for over 38% of total imports.By 2025, data shows early signs of marginal rebalancing. Russia’s share eased to around 35%, while Iraq (19%) and Saudi Arabia (13%) remained steady. Notably, US crude regained visibility with a share of about 6.5%, highlighting India’s continued effort to keep procurement diversified and flexible, especially amid periodic logistical and compliance-related uncertainties in global trade.Post the latest EU sanctions in August, and US tariff and sanction actions linked to Russian entities such as Rosneft and Lukoil, India’s oil procurement strategy has remained pragmatic and interest-driven.“While India continues to acknowledge and factor in global sanctions frameworks, energy security and supply stability remain the primary considerations. Russian crude has continued to form a key part of India’s import basket, although volumes have eased since around December 2025 amid tighter compliance scrutiny, logistical challenges and a conscious effort by refiners to limit concentration risk,” says Sumit Ritolia, Lead Research Analyst, Refining and Modelling, Kpler.With India importing almost over 85% of its crude oil requirements, the dependency on the world is very high. Experts say that energy security is not only vital to India’s economic growth, it is a strategic necessity. Is India insulated from possible global supply shocks?Sumit Ritolia of Kpler cautions that India remains structurally vulnerable to external energy shocks, as nearly nine-tenths of its crude oil requirements are met through imports.“However, the country’s overall energy security framework is stronger today than it was a few years ago,” he tells TOI.Sumit Ritolia explains: India has significantly diversified its crude oil sourcing base across geographies, reducing over-reliance and improving its ability to respond to supply disruptions.“Indian refiners have also enhanced operational flexibility, enabling them to process a wider range of crude grades and swiftly adjust procurement strategies in response to changing market or geopolitical conditions,” he says.Pranav Master, Senior Practice Leader and Director at Crisil Intelligence tells TOI, “As India enters 2026, global energy markets remain volatile. With over 85% dependence on crude oil imports, energy security has become a strategic necessity rather than a policy choice. In response, India has strengthened resilience by diversifying crude sourcing from fewer than 30 countries to around 40, spanning the Middle East, Africa, and the Americas. ”“This diversification, supported by robust refining capacity (around 258 MMTPA), and proactive steps taken by the government, has significantly reduced exposure to supply disruptions and price volatility for domestic consumers. While geopolitical risks persist, India has moved beyond being a passive price-taker and now exercises greater flexibility through procurement diversification and consistent diplomatic engagements,” he adds.Upgraded refinery capabilities now allow Indian refiners to rapidly switch among diverse Russian, American, and Middle Eastern crude oil grades based on price and compliance considerations.This transition has been driven by a move towards spot-market sourcing, supported by advanced refining infrastructure and strict compliance systems.India is also navigating the US pressure on Russian crude oil procurement by stepping up imports from the US. In fact, India’s crude oil imports from the US rose 92% in the first eight months of the current financial year! However, Russia remained the biggest supplier between April and November 2025.Sourav Mitra, Partner - Oil & Gas at Grant Thornton Bharat says, “India has made its stand clear that it will prioritise supply security and affordability for its 1.4 billion people. India did not deter from purchasing oil from Russia despite the US imposing 50% tariffs on India.”“India is tactfully navigating the situation by ramping up oil imports from the US even as Russian oil imports stay significant in FY26. India is maintaining a diverse sourcing mix in its crude basket amidst rising geopolitical uncertainty and Trump backing the Russia sanctions bill which proposes a 500% tariff on India,” he tells TOI.Manas Majumdar, Partner and Leader – Oil & Gas, Fuels & Resources at PwC India says that despite escalating sanctions and geopolitical turbulence, India remains relatively stable in terms of energy security as it has had a diversified set of suppliers - with close to 40 countries in the basket.“This broader supply pool enhances bargaining power, allows for various crude quality grades and insulates against geo-political disruptions. At one point, discounted Russian crude had grown to nearly 40% of our imports. This significantly eased cost pressures, and reduced dependence on other sources for e.g. Venezuela which helped in the short-term shocks. In the long-term if US sanctions on Venezuela go away and more oil flows, it can be a positive for India,” he tells TOI.Gaurav Moda, Partner and Energy Leader at EY-Parthenon India points out that given geopolitical dynamics especially in the past few years, the government and OMCs have diversified their sources of oil across several countries and providers. “Further, the OMCs have built up practice to keep 3-6 months stocks to iron out short term supply volatilities that have become inherent in the energy business. Such initiatives may help minimize impact on product supplies and end consumers in the near term,"" he tells TOI.Sumit Ritolia of Kpler notes one small but important movement on the domestic front: India continues to focus on strengthening its domestic supply base. “While crude oil production has not seen large step-change increases in recent years, upstream companies - led by national oil firms - have been steadily investing in enhanced oil recovery, redevelopment of mature fields and exploration of new sedimentary basins to stabilise output and slow natural declines,” he tells TOI.These efforts are aimed at creating incremental, durable gains rather than rapid spikes in production. Although domestic output cannot materially reduce import dependence, consistent upstream investment supports long-term resilience and helps improve energy security at the margin.“Collectively, diversified sourcing, strategic and commercial stockpiles, despite being below global benchmarks, and sustained efforts to strengthen domestic production place India in a relatively stronger position to navigate an increasingly uncertain global energy landscape,” he says.The biggest lure of the Russian crude oil, and the reason for its rising share in India’s crude oil basket has been the lucrative discounts. But what if under pressure from sanctions and tariffs, Indian refiners stop procuring discounted Russian crude?The answer isn’t straightforward, though the cost would be in billions: the impact on India’s crude import bill would depend on prevailing global market conditions, including supply–demand balances, benchmark prices, freight rates and the availability of alternative barrels.According to Sumit Ritolia, in 2025, India imported around 1.7 million barrels per day of such discounted crude from Russia, typically priced about $4–6 per barrel below other crudes in its import basket. At this differential, the cost advantage works out to roughly $3-4 billion per year.“If these volumes were replaced with alternative supplies at prevailing market prices, India’s crude import bill would rise by a similar order of magnitude, although the actual impact would ultimately depend on price movements, substitution costs and India’s ability to further optimise sourcing through diversification and refinery flexibility,” he explains.India currently imports over 85% of its crude requirement and this import bill is around $150 billion.Given Russian crude is a few dollars discounted to Brent (at peak this discount was more than $10-15+/ bbl), losing access to discounted Russian barrels could raise India’s annual crude bill by around $10 billion, says PwC’s Manas Majumdar. This estimate is based on a loss of roughly a $5‑per‑barrel discount across 1.85mbpd that India used to take earlier - however this quantum has reduced in recent times.Refinery margins may also be impacted, as discounted Russian crude is reduced, mostly for private refiners, he says. “We believe that losing these cheaper barrels would raise feedstock costs, and could shave around 1-2 percentage points off refining margins,” Majumdar tells TOI.In times of geopolitical uncertainties, supply shock possibilities, strategic oil reserves play a vital role. In the last few years India has been moving to shore up its strategic oil reserves to a 9–day cover which is what is standard maintained by OECD countries. However, there is still a long way to go.According to Sumit Ritolia, India’s strategic petroleum reserves currently stand at about 5.33 million metric tonnes. These are spread across underground caverns in Visakhapatnam, Mangaluru and Padur. This is around 39 million barrels, or around 9–10 days of national crude consumption.“While this is a meaningful safety net, it remains well below the 90-day cover maintained by most OECD economies when combining strategic and commercial stocks,” Ritolia points out.The government has announced Phase-II plans to add around 6.5 million tonnes of additional storage, but progress has been slow due to land acquisition and execution challenges, he adds.Manas Majumdar of PwC points to India’s planned expansion of strategic oil reserves at Chandikhol and Padur. In addition new sites are being planned in Bikaner, Bina. There is a capex allocation of around Rs 5000 crore plus for these expansions, and these plans need to be expedited, he tells TOI.“In addition, India can diversify strategic petroleum reserves storage types, and in addition to existing underground caverns blend with above-ground and commercial storage to enhance capacity. Also, bolster pipeline and trans-national supply chain resilience for crude flow and also to mitigate potential logistics chokepoints at areas like Strait of Hormuz,” he says.In addition to government-held strategic reserves, Indian refiners and oil marketing companies maintain their own inventories in the form of crude oil and refined petroleum products across refineries, pipelines and storage terminals.Experts differ on the number of days the stocks with oil marketing companies can cover.Ritolia says that these operational and commercial stocks can typically cater to domestic demand for an additional 10–20 days, depending on market conditions and throughput.“When combined with strategic petroleum reserves, these inventories provide India with a more meaningful buffer against supply shocks, even though overall emergency cover still falls short of global benchmarks and will need to expand in line with the country’s rising oil demand,” he says.However, Pranav Master of Crisil Intelligence says that combined with storage held by oil marketing companies, the total coverage stands at around 70–75 days.“Budgetary allocation for oil purchases reflects a shift toward proactive stockpiling during favorable price cycles, strengthening India’s ability to absorb future supply shocks. Apart from conventional coastal caverns, the exploration of salt-cavern-based storage should also be considered to enhance storage capacities,” he says.As India builds capacity to store more strategic petroleum reserves, it is important for it to speed up the process amidst ongoing geopolitical uncertainty that add to chances of supply shocks.“To better protect against global supply shocks, India needs to accelerate the completion of Phase-II strategic petroleum reserve capacity and ensure that existing and new caverns are consistently filled, well-maintained and operationally ready for timely release during emergencies,” says Sumit Ritolia.He is of the view that as demand continues to rise, expanding strategic petroleum reserves capacity in line with consumption growth will be critical to prevent a dilution of strategic cover over time.Experts also say that India needs to continue looking beyond crude to meet energy needs of the future.Sourav Mitra of Grant Thornton Bharat notes that India is doubling down on alternate sources of energy such as LNG, renewables, biofuels etc. to reduce oil dependency while ensuring reliability.According to a reply in Lok Sabha by MoS Petroleum and Natural Gas Suresh Gopi, to counter the reliance on fossil fuels, the government has adopted a multi-pronged strategy to promote clean energy - It is stepping up natural gas usage, improving refinery efficiency, and boosting domestic oil and gas production.In the meantime, it is also accelerating the adoption of biofuels and clean alternatives such as ethanol blends, bio-CNG, biodiesel, green hydrogen and EVs.Kpler’s Ritolia says that India would benefit from creating limited strategic reserves of refined products such as gasoline, diesel and aviation turbine fuel near major demand centres, which would help manage short-duration disruptions and logistical bottlenecks more effectively.“In parallel, strengthening domestic crude oil production should remain a key pillar of resilience. While large and rapid increases in output are unlikely, continued investment in enhanced oil recovery, redevelopment of mature fields and timely monetisation of discoveries can help stabilise production and deliver gradual gains. Alongside diversified imports and stronger stockholding, even incremental improvements in domestic output can reduce vulnerability at the margin and improve India’s ability to withstand external supply shocks,” he concludes.To sum it up: In a world of rising tensions, India has done well to diversify its crude basket so that temporary disruptions and choking of supply channels don’t have a long-term negative impact on the economy. Russia has only recently become a major oil supplier for India, and if it has to diversify away from it, the hit will not be too significant, though experts say Russian oil will not completely disappear. As it looks to build strategic oil reserves, there is a need to expedite the process, while also looking at non-fossil fuel based alternatives.","Recent geopolitical tensions and Trump tariffs on India highlight the need for India to step up focus on its energy security. With over 85% of its crude oil needs, the dependency on the world is very high. Experts say that energy security is not only vital to India’s economic growth, it is a strategic necessity.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126449225,imgsize-108072,width-400,resizemode-4/india-energy-security.jpg"
Cigarette tax hike: Experts warn of surge in illicit trade; fear major revenue losses for government,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/cigarette-tax-hike-experts-warn-of-surge-in-illicit-trade-fear-major-revenue-losses-for-government/articleshow/126334324.cms,"Representative image

A sharp increase in taxes on cigarettes, along with a new excise duty structure on tobacco products, could trigger a surge in illicit trade and lead to significant revenue losses for the government, experts have warned.Earlier this week, the finance ministry notified amendments to the Central Excise Act, introducing a fresh excise duty ranging from Rs 2,050 to Rs 8,500 per 1,000 cigarette sticks, depending on their length.The new excise duty, which comes into effect from February 1, will be levied in addition to the existing 40 per cent Goods and Services Tax ( GST ).This change implies an overall tax hike of around 60–70 per cent, varying by cigarette length, compared with the current overall tax incidence of about 50–55 per cent.The move marks a transition from the GST compensation cess to an excise-based regime for demerit goods.The unexpected nature of the tax increase has raised concerns about higher smuggling and illegal trade in tobacco products.According to news agency PTI, Ranganath Tannir, secretary general of Think Change Forum, said the steep rise could prove counterproductive. “Public finance theory is clear that excessive taxation of inelastic goods fuels illicit trade, not compliance,” he said, adding that cigarettes in India are already among the least affordable globally based on World Health Organization affordability indicators.Making them more expensive is unlikely to curb demand, but could push consumers towards illegal and smuggled products, undermining tax collections, he noted.Brokerage reports have echoed similar concerns. According to JPMorgan’s Asia Pacific Equity Research, a higher tax rate for the King Size Filter Tip (KSFT) segment increases the risk of consumers downtrading to cheaper options and may also lead to higher consumption of illicit cigarettes.Illicit tobacco already accounts for about 26 per cent of India’s total tobacco market, making the country the fourth-largest market globally for smuggled tobacco, PTI reported.Nomura, in its research note, said that while higher taxes are aimed at reducing consumption, they often have unintended consequences. “High taxes on cigarettes… fuel the growth of illicit cigarettes and push consumers towards cheaper, non-tax paid smuggled cigarettes,” the brokerage said.Jefferies, citing a report by the Tobacco Institute of India (TII), said the industry body has urged the government to review the proposed excise structure.A wider gap between legal and illegal prices could benefit non-duty-paid cigarettes and result in higher tax leakage, the report noted.Experts also pointed to international experience to underline the risks. Australia’s repeated tobacco tax hikes between 2012 and 2020 led to a sharp rise in cigarette prices and were followed by a jump in illicit tobacco consumption from under 2 per cent to around 14 per cent of the market.Calling the proposed excise levies “unprecedented”, an analyst said there is still time to reassess the decision before it comes into force.“Since they take effect from February 1, 2026, the government has an opportunity to revisit and rectify them before they spawn a much larger problem of uncontrollable illicit networks,” the analyst warned, as per PTI.","The finance ministry notified amendments to the Central Excise Act, introducing a fresh excise duty ranging from Rs 2,050 to Rs 8,500 per 1,000 cigarette sticks.

Greenland's harsh environment and lack of infrastructure have prevented rare earth mining,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/greenlands-harsh-environment-and-lack-of-infrastructure-have-prevented-rare-earth-mining/articleshow/126461941.cms,"'Europe Weak & Divided': EU Leader Admits 'DEEP CRISIS' As Trump Threatens Greenland Invasion

Greenland's harsh environment, lack of key infrastructure and difficult geology have so far prevented anyone from building a mine to extract the sought-after rare earth elements that many high-tech products require. Even if President Donald Trump prevails in his effort to take control of the arctic island, those challenges won't go away.Trump has prioritized breaking China's stranglehold on the global supply of rare earths ever since the world's number two economy sharply restricted who could buy them after the United States imposed widespread tariffs last spring. The Trump administration has invested hundreds of millions of dollars and even taken stakes in several companies. Now the president is again pitching the idea that wresting control of Greenland away from Denmark could solve the problem.""We are going to do something on Greenland whether they like it or not,"" Trump said Friday.But Greenland may not be able to produce rare earths for years - if ever. Some companies are trying anyway, but their efforts to unearth some of the 1.5 million tons of rare earths encased in rock in Greenland generally haven't advanced beyond the exploratory stage.Trump's fascination with the island nation may be more about countering Russian and Chinese influence in the Arctic than securing any of the hard-to-pronounce elements like neodymium and terbium that are used to produce the high-powered magnets needed in electric vehicles, wind turbines, robots and fighter jets among other products.""The fixation on Greenland has always been more about geopolitical posturing - a military-strategic interest and stock-promotion narrative - than a realistic supply solution for the tech sector,"" said Tracy Hughes, founder and executive director of the Critical Minerals Institute. ""The hype far outstrips the hard science and economics behind these critical minerals.""Trump confirmed those geopolitical concerns at the White House Friday.""We don't want Russia or China going to Greenland, which if we don't take Greenland, you can have Russia or China as your next door neighbor. That's not going to happen,"" Trump saidA difficult place to build a mine The main challenge to mine in Greenland is, ""of course, the remoteness. Even in the south where it's populated, there are few roads and no railways, so any mining venture would have to create these accessibilities,"" said Diogo Rosa, an economic geology researcher at the Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland. Power would also have to be generated locally, and expert manpower would have to be brought in.Another concern is the prospect of mining rare earths in the fragile Arctic environment just as Greenland tries to build a thriving tourism industry, said Patrick Schroder, a senior fellow in the Environment and Society program at the Chatham House think-tank in London.""Toxic chemicals needed to separate the minerals out from the rock, so that can be highly polluting and further downstream as well, the processing,"" Shroder said. Plus, rare earths are often found alongside radioactive uranium.Besides the unforgiving climate that encases much of Greenland under layers of ice and freezes the northern fjords for much of the year, the rare earths found there tend to be encased in a complex type of rock called eudialyte, and no one has ever developed a profitable process to extract rare earths from that type of rock. Elsewhere, these elements are normally found in different rock formation called carbonatites, and there are proven methods to work with that.""If we're in a race for resources - for critical minerals - then we should be focusing on the resources that are most easily able to get to market,"" said David Abraham, a rare earths expert who has followed the industry for decades and wrote the book ""The Elements of Power.""This week, Critical Metals' stock price more than doubled after it said it plans to build a pilot plant in Greenland this year. But that company and more than a dozen others exploring deposits on the island remain far away from actually building a mine and would still need to raise at least hundreds of millions of dollars.Producing rare earths is a tough business Even the most promising projects can struggle to turn a profit, particularly when China resorts to dumping extra materials onto the market to depress prices and drive competitors out of business as it has done many times in the past. And currently most critical minerals have to be processed in China.The U.S. is scrambling to expand the supply of rare earths outside of China during the one-year reprieve from even tougher restrictions that Trump said Xi Jinping agreed to in October. A number of companies around the world are already producing rare earths or magnets and can deliver more quickly than anything in Greenland, which Trump has threatened to seize with military power if Denmark doesn't agree to sell it.""Everybody's just been running to get to this endpoint. And if you go to Greenland, it's like you're going back to the beginning,"" said Ian Lange, an economics professor who focuses on rare earths at the Colorado School of Mines.Focusing on more promising projects elsewhere Many in the industry, too, think America should focus on helping proven companies instead of trying to build new rare earth mines in Greenland, Ukraine, Africa or elsewhere. A number of other mining projects in the U.S. and friendly nations like Australia are farther along and in much more accessible locations.The U.S. government has invested directly in the company that runs the only rare earths mine in the U.S., MP Materials, and a lithium miner and a company that recycles batteries and other products with rare earths.Scott Dunn, CEO of Noveon Magnetics, said those investments should do more to reduce China's leverage, but it's hard to change the math quickly when more than 90% of the world's rare earths come from China.""There are very few folks that can rely on a track record for delivering anything in each of these instances, and that obviously should be where we start, and especially in my view if you're the US government,"" said Dunn, whose company is already producing more than 2,000 metric tons of magnets each year at a plant in Texas from elements it gets outside of China.","Greenland's harsh environment, lack of key infrastructure and difficult geology have so far prevented anyone from building a mine.

Posting on Truth Social, he said Americans should no longer be “ripped off” by card issuers charging interest rates of 20–30 per cent.In a joint statement issued late Friday, five major banking industry groups said they shared the president’s goal of making credit more affordable, but cautioned against the proposed cap.“At the same time, evidence shows that a 10 per cent interest rate cap would reduce credit availability and be devastating for millions of American families and small business owners who rely on and value their credit cards,” the associations said.They added that such a cap, if implemented, could push consumers towards “less regulated, more costly alternatives”.The statement was issued by the American Bankers Association, Bank Policy Institute, Consumer Bankers Association, Financial Services Forum and the Independent Community Bankers of America.Credit cards remain the primary source of consumer credit in the US, with usage rising sharply in recent years as households lean on borrowing to maintain spending, including for essential expenses. Federal Reserve data shows that total outstanding credit card debt crossed $1.23 trillion by the end of September, making it the fourth-largest category of household debt after mortgages, student loans and auto loans.According to the Fed, credit card interest rates currently stand at 21 per cent or higher and can go up to 38 per cent for borrowers with higher risk profiles. This compares with an average of about 12 per cent a decade ago.With midterm elections due in November, Trump is under pressure to deliver on campaign promises to lower the cost of living amid persistent inflation and growing consumer stress.However, Senator Elizabeth Warren, the top Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee, questioned Trump’s intent, noting his administration’s efforts to weaken the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.“Begging credit card companies to play nice is a joke,” Warren said in a statement. “Trump doesn’t care about affordability.”","US banks have flagged concerns over President Donald Trump’s call to sharply cut credit card interest rates.

A country rich in oil, poor in production



Trump’s argument: security, speed and scale



ExxonMobil draws a clear boundary



Chevron’s limited optimism



Conditional interest from others



Economics and risk still dominate



What the meeting revealed



The bottom line



When US President Donald Trump met senior oil executives to press for investment in Venezuela, the message from the White House was deliberately ambitious. Venezuela has the world’s largest proven oil reserves. Its political landscape, Trump argued, has shifted. With American backing and security guarantees, the country should once again become a major destination for US energy capital.The response from the oil industry was notably restrained.Executives did not dispute Venezuela’s resource potential. Instead, they pointed to a combination of legal uncertainty, economic risk and hard-earned experience that continues to make large-scale investment unattractive, even with presidential support.Venezuela’s oil numbers are striking. The country holds an estimated 303 billion barrels of proven reserves, roughly 17% of the global total, more than any other nation. In the late 1990s, it produced over 3 million barrels per day, ranking among the world’s leading exporters.Today, output has fallen to below 1 million barrels per day. Years of mismanagement, underinvestment, sanctions and infrastructure decay have hollowed out what was once one of the most sophisticated oil industries in the developing world.This collapse is central to the scepticism voiced by oil companies. Restoring production on a meaningful scale is not a matter of restarting wells. It would require rebuilding pipelines, upgraders, refineries, power supply and skilled manpower, all of which demand long-term capital commitments.At the meeting, Trump urged companies to think big. He spoke of investments running up to $100 billion, promised “total security” for American firms and suggested deals could be finalised quickly. The broader geopolitical framing was also clear: US companies should move decisively to prevent China or Russia from expanding their footprint in Venezuela.From the administration’s perspective, Venezuela’s oil represents both an economic and strategic opportunity. For the companies in the room, however, the issue was not opportunity but risk.The most direct assessment came from ExxonMobil. Its chief executive described Venezuela’s current investment environment as “uninvestable”. The comment reflected Exxon’s long institutional memory. The company has operated in Venezuela since the 1940s, and has seen its assets expropriated twice, most recently during the nationalisation wave under Hugo Chávez.For Exxon, whose projects often involve tens of billions of dollars and operate over 20 to 30 years, the absence of durable legal protections is decisive. The company indicated it could send a technical team to assess the condition of assets, but stopped well short of committing capital.The distinction matters. Technical assessments are reversible. Large upstream investments are not.If Exxon articulated the industry’s red lines, Chevron illustrated what cautious engagement looks like. Chevron is already operating in Venezuela through joint ventures and special licences. At the meeting, it said production from its existing operations could increase by as much as 50% over the next 18 to 24 months.That figure, while significant, must be viewed in context. Chevron’s Venezuelan output remains a fraction of the country’s historical production. The projected increase reflects incremental improvements to existing assets, not the launch of new, capital-intensive projects.Chevron’s stance suggested that limited gains are possible where infrastructure and personnel are already in place, but that this does not justify a rapid expansion of exposure.Other companies struck a similar tone.Shell indicated it has several billion dollars’ worth of potential opportunities in Venezuela, but only if sanctions waivers and regulatory clarity are sustained over time. Without that certainty, the projects remain hypothetical. Oilfield services firms such as SLB expressed confidence in their ability to ramp up activity. Their optimism reflects a different risk profile. Service providers supply equipment and expertise and can scale operations more easily than producers who must commit capital to fields and infrastructure. Meanwhile, Continental Resources founder Harold Hamm, a close ally of Trump, described Venezuela’s reserves as a “real jewel” while declining to commit investment. The assessment captured the mood in the room: admiration without obligation.Beyond politics, the economics remain challenging. Much of Venezuela’s crude is heavy or extra-heavy, making it more expensive to extract and refine.Restoring production requires reliable access to diluents, functioning upgraders and stable export logistics. Industry estimates suggest that reviving Venezuela’s oil sector at scale would require tens of billions of dollars in upfront investment, with returns spread over decades. At a time when oil companies have access to lower-cost, lower-risk projects elsewhere, particularly in parts of South America and offshore developments, Venezuela struggles to compete on risk-adjusted returns.The White House meeting did not produce the sweeping commitments Trump had hoped for. Instead, it clarified the industry’s position. Oil companies are not disputing Venezuela’s resource base. They are questioning whether the legal, regulatory and political environment is stable enough to support long-term investment. Exxon wants structural reform before capital. Chevron will optimise what it already operates. Shell wants sustained sanctions clarity. Service companies are ready to engage, but operators remain cautious.Venezuela’s vast oil reserves are beyond doubt. What remains uncertain is whether the conditions needed to attract large, long-term investment can be put in place and sustained. Until oil companies are confident that contracts will be enforced, policies will remain predictable and political shifts will not undo commercial agreements, interest is likely to remain measured and capital deployment limited. The meeting underscored that for Big Oil, enthusiasm follows stability, not the other way around.","US President Donald Trump met senior oil executives to press for investment in Venezuela.

EU–Mercosur trade deal row: Why are Irish farmers protesting against the pact; what’s at stake,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/eumercosur-trade-deal-row-why-are-irish-farmers-protesting-against-the-pact-whats-at-stake/articleshow/126453316.cms,"File photo- Protestors burn tires during a demonstration of European farmers outside the EU Summit meeting in Brussels.

Why farmers are protesting



Several thousand Irish farmers took to the streets of central Ireland on Saturday to protest the European Union’s trade agreement with the South American bloc Mercosur, a day after EU member states approved the deal despite opposition from Ireland and France, according to AFP.Tractors converged on the town of Athlone, with farmers holding placards reading “Stop EU-Mercosur” and banners depicting the European Union flag marked with the words “sell out”. The protest formed part of wider demonstrations across Europe, with farmers marching in Poland and blocking roads in France and Belgium on Friday as the deal received political clearance.The EU–Mercosur agreement, negotiated over more than 25 years, aims to create one of the world’s largest free-trade areas, linking the 27-nation EU with Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay. Under the pact, Mercosur would gain greater access to EU markets for agricultural products and minerals, while European exporters would benefit from lower tariffs on machinery, chemicals and pharmaceuticals.Irish farmers say the deal threatens to undercut domestic agriculture by opening the door to large volumes of cheaper imports, particularly beef, from South America. The agreement is opposed by farm groups over concerns that an additional 99,000 tonnes of low-cost beef could enter the EU market, putting pressure on prices and farm incomes in Ireland.These concerns prompted Ireland, France, Poland, Hungary and Austria to vote against the accord at the EU level.The Irish Farmers’ Association (IFA), the country’s main farming lobby, described the approval of the deal as “very disappointing” and said it would intensify efforts to block the agreement in the European Parliament.“We expect Irish MEPs to stand behind the farming community and reject the Mercosur deal,” IFA president Francie Gorman said in a statement.Although EU governments have approved the pact, it still requires backing from a majority of Members of the European Parliament in the coming months, where shifting alliances could influence the final outcome.","Several thousand Irish farmers took to the streets of central Ireland on Saturday to protest the European Union’s trade agreement with the South American bloc Mercosur.

In a statement, Bangladesh’s chief adviser Muhammad Yunus said the talks marked “an important step forward” in strengthening a mutually beneficial economic partnership between the two countries.According to Yunus, the US trade representative ambassador Jamieson Greer has agreed to raise with President Donald Trump the possibility of reducing Bangladesh’s current 20% reciprocal tariff rate.The move, requested by National Security Adviser Dr Khalilur Rahman during his visit to Washington, would bring Bangladesh’s tariff treatment more in line with that of regional competitors and expand access for its vital garment sector.The trade talks come as Bangladesh moves to ease tensions with Washington through increased imports of US agricultural products.Dhaka has approved the purchase of around 220,000 metric tonnes of US wheat under a government-to-government deal, following a broader memorandum of understanding signed in July committing Bangladesh to import 700,000 tonnes of US wheat annually over the next five years. Officials say the strategy is aimed at diversifying grain sources and narrowing a sizeable trade imbalance.In 2024, total US goods and services trade with Bangladesh reached an estimated $12.4 billion, up three per cent from the previous year.While US goods exports rose modestly to $2.3 billion, imports from Bangladesh climbed to $8.4 billion, leaving Washington with a goods trade deficit of $6.1 billion.","US trade representative ambassador Jamieson Greer has agreed to raise with President Donald Trump the possibility of reducing Bangladesh’s current 20% reciprocal tariff rate.

Fifth Oil Tanker With Venezuelan Oil ‘CAPTURED’; Russia Watches Closely

US President Donald Trump held talks with senior oil executives on Friday (local time), pushing them to consider investments in Venezuela’s oil sector following the capture of President Nicolas Maduro. While Trump presented the country as newly secure and open for business, industry leaders responded cautiously, with one major executive saying Venezuela remains “uninvestable” without deep reforms.Speaking at the White House, Trump said his administration would take charge of deciding which companies are allowed to operate in Venezuela, sidelining Caracas from the process. He argued that foreign firms had previously operated without adequate protections under Maduro and claimed the situation had now fundamentally changed.“We're going to be making the decision as to which oil companies are going to go in... (we're) going to cut a deal with the companies,” Trump said. “But now you have total security. It's a whole different Venezuela.”Trump added that oil companies would “deal with us directly,” signalling that Washington would manage access to Venezuela’s oil resources and exclude the country itself from negotiations.However, ExxonMobil chief executive Darren Woods raised serious doubts about returning to the country, citing the company’s history of asset seizures.“We've had our assets seized there twice and so, you can imagine, to re-enter a third time would require some pretty significant changes,” Woods said. “If we look at the legal and commercial constructs and frameworks in place today in Venezuela -- today, it's uninvestable.”The meeting came days after US forces seized Maduro, an action Trump has openly linked to Venezuela’s oil wealth. He said discussions with executives would centre on rapidly restoring the country’s deteriorated oil infrastructure and increasing output by millions of barrels per day.Those attending included Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Energy Secretary Chris Wright, along with executives from Chevron, ExxonMobil, ConocoPhillips, Halliburton, Valero, Marathon, Shell, Trafigura, Vitol Americas and Repsol.A ConocoPhillips spokesman said chief executive Ryan Lance valued the talks around “preparing Venezuela to be investment ready.”After the meeting, Trump said participants had “sort of formed a deal,” though he did not provide details. He claimed companies were ready to invest “at least 100 Billion Dollars” in the country.Analysts told AFP that the plan to revive Venezuela’s oil industry faces major obstacles. They said the size of the country’s reserves does not guarantee quick or profitable production, pointing to ageing infrastructure, political risks, costly heavy crude extraction and growing investor caution as the world moves away from fossil fuels.“There's lots of talk about the size of the reserves -- 300 billion barrels of proved reserves -- but what's often missing from the conversation is how realistic it is for those to be economically extracted,” said Rich Collett-White, an energy analyst at Carbon Tracker.Energy Secretary Chris Wright, who has previously said the US would control Venezuela’s oil industry “indefinitely,” acknowledged after the talks that rebuilding the sector would “take time.”Meanwhile, Venezuela’s interim President Delcy Rodriguez said her government remained in control of the country, while the state oil company said it was holding negotiations with Washington.Chevron is currently the only US firm licensed to operate in Venezuela. ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips exited the country in 2007 after rejecting demands from then-president Hugo Chavez to give the state majority control.Trump also said in a social media post that he had cancelled a second round of strikes on Venezuela, citing what he described as “cooperation” from the country.Venezuela has been under US sanctions since 2019 and holds around one-fifth of the world’s oil reserves. Despite this, it accounted for only about one percent of global crude production in 2024, according to OPEC, after years of underinvestment, sanctions and embargoes.Trump sees Venezuela’s oil wealth as a potential boost to his efforts to further bring down fuel prices in the United States.",US President Donald Trump held talks with senior oil executives on Friday.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground.Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change, too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume.

Startups will play important role in helping India become 3rd largest economy: CEA Nageswaran,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/startups-will-play-important-role-in-helping-india-become-3rd-largest-economy-cea-nageswaran/articleshow/105332523.cms,"Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran





THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Startups will play an important role in helping India become the third largest economy in the world, Chief Economic Advisor (CEA) to the Union government V Anantha Nageswaran has said.Nageswaran said that tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country due to improvements in infrastructure and supportive policies of the government, according to a KSUM release.The CEA, during his Leadership Talk on the concluding day of the Huddle Global 2023 organised by the Kerala Startup Mission (KSUM), said that India was the fifth largest economy on course to become the third largest in a few years.""In fact, I will say 7-in-7 is the buzz slogan, that is 7 trillion USD economy in seven years. Seven trillion USD economy size by 2030 is possible if India maintains its present growth trajectory, and in that journey startup entrepreneurs are going to play an important role,"" he is quoted as having said in the release.He was of the view that the active participation of startups in India in developing business models on the foundation of expanding physical and digital infrastructure will continue to generate efficiency, revenue and economic returns for the country.""The last decade has seen an exceptional transformation in the startup landscape in India, which has emerged as the third largest ecosystem globally, with over 1.12 lakh startups presently recognised by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) across 763 districts.""Among them, more than 110 are unicorns with a total valuation of around USD 350 billion,"" he said.The CEA further said that the country ranks second in innovation quality.He said that innovation in India was not just limited to certain sectors as startups were solving problems in 56 industrial sectors, with 13 per cent of them from IT services, nine per cent from health and life sciences, seven per cent from education, five per cent from agriculture and five per cent from food and beverages.Nageswaran also said it was significant that 49 per cent of the startups were from tier-2 and 3 cities which have turned to be game-changers as the business advantages in these locations enable entrepreneurs to operate at lower costs as compared to tier-1 cities.""Apart from improved infrastructure and the government's pro-active policies, the availability of a technically skilled talent pool is a huge advantage for startups to set up and flourish in tier-2 and tier-3 cities,"" he said.He said that historically there was a perception that small towns were difficult places to conduct business.""...but with improved internet penetration, vastly better physical infrastructure, road, rail and air connectivity and supportive government policies, this is no longer true,"" he said.He also noted Kerala's startup journey has been an inspiring one.The CEA said that KSUM has served as the catalyst since its establishment in 2006 to promote change that propelled the state into the forefront of the global startup arena.KSUM is the Kerala government's nodal agency established in 2006 for entrepreneurship development and incubation activities in the state.Nageswaran said that with over 4,000 registered tech startups, 63 incubators and 10 lakh square feet of incubation space, KSUM has not only met its goal of promoting technology-based entrepreneurship but has also earned the distinguished position of being among the world's top business incubators.The November 16-18 fifth edition of Huddle Global, India's biggest beachside startup conclave, was organised by KSUM at Adimalathura beach, near Vizhinjam, here.Attended by around 1,500 delegates, the event displayed sophisticated products from emerging sectors such as robotics, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, life sciences, space tech, blockchain, IoT, e-governance, fintech, healthtech, agritech, edutech and SaaS from across the country.","Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran said tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country.

E-Commerce startup Udaan to trim costs ahead of 2025 IPO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/e-commerce-startup-udaan-to-trim-costs-ahead-of-2025-ipo/articleshow/105001132.cms,"E-commerce startup Udaan is working to curb costs and forge new partnerships with consumer brands in India as it prepares to go public in 2025.Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta said in an interview. That’s set to happen around the same time as its initial public offering, he said.The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said. “Second, strategically we want to ensure that we are top of mind with shopkeepers, with big manufacturers, and we maintain our relative market share.”Lightspeed Venture Partners-backed Udaan is among startups trying to tap the rapid growth of India’s economy and consumer market, while meeting investor demands for profitability. Udaan, which at its peak employed thousands, joined fellow Indian startups in slashing jobs last year and tightening internal controls and compliance. It now has about 1,800 staff, and Gupta didn’t specify if further job cuts are needed.Corporate governance lapses at Indian online tutoring firm Byju’s, once the country’s top startup with a valuation of $22 billion, shone a light at unique challenges faced by founders in the South Asian nation and drove companies to be more diligent.“We continue to move towards more professionalized management, professionalized board and also institutionalized shareholders as we go towards public markets,” Gupta said.Udaan is yet to decide whether it will list in India or overseas. It was valued at more than $3 billion in a 2021 funding round, and was in talks to raise $400 million, Business Standard reported in September. Lightspeed owns about 35% of Udaan, while Tencent Holdings Ltd. holds 6%.The company was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran Udaan until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021. The other two founders — Amod Malviya and Sujeet Kumar — are board members.Udaan built an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business still accounts for a very small part of India’s overall retail market but can balloon to $150 billion in sales and yield a 100% return on capital invested in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co. estimates published in the Mint newspaper.Bengaluru-based Udaan has also ventured into financing through its fintech unit which helps shopkeepers get working capital loans to buy inventory. That business is profitable before taxes and is growing 70% annually, Gupta said.“That’s a second business in the overall umbrella of Udaan trying to organize trade in the country,” Gupta said. “In addition to commerce, financing becomes an important market opportunity.”","Udaan will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta says.

How India's GDP has been growing

What SBI report said on savings and investment

Incremental capital output ratio

NEW DELHI: India's gross domestic product (GDP) data for the third quarter (October-December 2022) received a word of caution from the former Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Raghuram Rajan In an interview with news agency PTI, Rajan that India is ""dangerously close"" to the Hindu rate of growth in view of subdued private sector investment, high interest rates and slowing global growth.India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%.Rajan termed this sequential slowdown in growth as ""worrying"".However, a report released by the State Bank of India (SBI) economists on Tuesday dismissed arguments that India is dangerously close to Hindu rate of growth saying such statements are ""ill-conceived, biased and premature"".The term 'Hindu growth rate' was coined by late economist Raj Krishna in 1978 to describe the slow growth in the country.It basically refers to the low pace of economic growth rates during 1950s to 1980s. During this period, the Indian economy averaged 3.5%.A former lecturer at the Delhi School of Economics (DSE), Krishna noted that only if the rate of growth is persistently slow and accompanied by low per-capita GDP, then it will be known as Hindu rate of growth but it has to factor in population growth as well.Before economic reforms of 1991, India's economic growth remained stagnant and low, while per capita income averaged around 1.3%.Krishna termed this low growth situation to be a result of socialist policies of state control and import substitution.However, the economic situation changed when liberalisation, privatisation and globalisation (LPG) reforms came into effect in the year 1991, at a time when India faced balance of payment crisis.Over the years, many economists have strongly opposed the idea of 'Hindu growth rate' and the term never had universal acceptance.The Indian economy plunged into its very first technical recession in FY21 due to the impact of Covid-19 pandemic and the related nationwide lockdowns. GDP shrunk by an unprecedented 23.8% in the first quarter of the financial year 2020-21. However, due to spurt in economic activities in the subsequent quarters, the GDP decline started to narrow.However, if we look at the period before Covid-19 as well, India's growth curve shows a declining trend.From 8.26% in FY17, GDP growth plunged to 3.74% in FY20. Shutdown of economic activities in FY21 in wake of Covid-19 only made matters worse.As lockdowns started to ease and business activities resumed, India's GDP also started rising. In Q1 of FY22, growth jumped to 20.1% mainly on account of low base effect. By the fourth quarter of FY22, growth came down to 4.10%.Similarly, the new financial year 2022-23 brought fresh economic challenges in the form of Russia-Ukraine war that impacted almost all major economies of the world, slowed the pace of growth, pushed inflation to record highs.As a result, the central banks of all advanced economies spurred into action and opted for monetary policy tightening to curb the soaring inflation.With persistently rising interest rates, India's economy grew by 4.4% in Q3 of FY23, as the Centre revised upwards GDP growth for previous year to 9.10% from 8.7% earlier.The report weighed recent GDP numbers against the available data on savings and investments for the past decade and highlighted some interesting points.""Quarterly growth numbers are noisy and should be best avoided for any serious interpretation (on an average, India's GDP growth has witnessed Rs 2 lakh crore upward revision for the 3 year ended FY23),"" the report said.Gross capital formation (GCF) by the government touched a high of 11.8% in 2021-22, up from 10.7% in 2020-21.""This also had a domino effect on private sector investment that jumped from 10 per cent to 10.8% over the same period,"" it said.In fact, Ecowrap added that the trends in GCF to gross output ratio or the plough back of funds for creation of fresh capacity shows that for public administration the ratio attained fresh peak in 2021-22 owing to the emphasis on capital expenditure in recent budgets.At the aggregate level, gross capital formation is supposed to have crossed 32% in 2022-23, the highest level since 2018-19.According to the report, in 2021-22, gross savings have risen to 30% from 29% in 2020-21.""The ratio is supposed to have crossed 31 per cent in 2022-23, the highest since 2018-19. The household savings increased sharply during the pandemic period on account of sharp accretion in financial savings such as deposits,"" said the report by SBI's Economic Research Department.While household financial savings have since then moderated from 15.4% in 2020-21 to 11.1% in 2022-23, savings in physical assets have grown sharply to 11.8% in 2021-22 from 10.7% in 2020-21.The report further analysed Incremental Capital Output ratio (ICOR) -- which measures additional units of capital (investment) needed to produce additional units of output. It said that the ratio has been improving.""ICOR which was 7.5 in FY 12 is now only 3.5 in FY22. Clearly, only half of capital is now needed for next unit of output,"" the report noted.Such reducing ICOR in the current years reflects a relatively increasing efficiency of capital and shows that the economy is on a sound footing, the report said.""From that point of view, future GDP growth rates even at 7% could still mean a decent number by any standards!,"" it added.","India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%.

An employee is entitled for a 50 per cent amount of the last drawn salary as pension.OPS was discontinued by the NDA government in 2003 with effect from April 1, 2004.Under the new pension scheme (NPS), employees contribute 10 per cent of their basic salary towards pension while the government contributes 14 per cent.Governments of Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand have informed the central government/ Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA about their decision to restart OPS for their employees.The government of Punjab on November 18, 2022, issued a notification regarding implementation of OPS for the state government employees who are being covered under NPS. Jharkhand too has decided to revert to OPS.",Former RBI governor Raghuram Rajan has expressed his concern over the decision of some states to restart the old pension scheme.

ICICIBC continues to leverage its strong retail and corporate franchise, disciplined risk management, and superior operating metrics. With leadership continuity under Mr. Sandeep Bakhshi, the bank is well positioned to sustain healthy loan growth momentum and deliver best-in-class profitability across cycles. 3QFY26 PAT declined 4% YoY to INR113.2b, missing estimates due to one-off INR12.8b agri-related provisions.Core performance was steady, with NII, PPoP, margins, and asset quality in line, while credit trends in unsecured portfolios showed improvement. Despite one-off provisions, ICICIBC is on track to deliver ~2.2% RoA in FY26E, improving to ~2.3% over FY27–28E. We fine-tune estimates and model FY27E RoA/RoE of 2.3%/16.1%, reiterating ICICIBC as a top BUY.Tata Steel is well placed to benefit from improving steel realizations, operating efficiencies, and robust domestic demand. While global tariff-related uncertainties may weigh in the near term, sustained strength in India and improving Europe performance support long-term earnings visibility. The acquisition of a 50.01% stake in Thriveni Pellets provides Tata Steel access to 4mtpa pellet capacity and a 212km slurry pipeline.This strengthens backward integration, supports upcoming expansions, and mitigates risks from expiring iron-ore leases by FY30.Tata Steel is entering a multi-year expansion across long, flat, and downstream products. Capex will rise in a phased manner, maintaining balance sheet comfort. The LMEL MoU and Odisha footprint enhance feedstock security and future capacity optionality.","Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd, the top stock picks for the trading week (starting January 27, 2026) are ICICI Bank and Tata Steel. 3QFY26 PAT declined 4% YoY to INR113.2b, missing estimates due to one-off INR12.8b agri-related provisions.ICICIBC continues to leverage its strong retail and corporate franchise, disciplined risk management, and superior operating metrics.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127592369,imgsize-23578,width-400,resizemode-4/top-stocks-to-buy.jpg"

Stock market today: Nifty50 and BSE Sensex , the Indian equity benchmarks, turned green in early trade, even though opening with a low on Tuesday. While Nifty50 was over 25,000, BSE Sensex was down up by over 250 points. At 9:50 AM, Nifty50 was trading at 25,144.45,up 95.80 points or 0.38%. BSE Sensex was at 81,791.64, up 253.94 points or 0.31%.Last week, Indian equities remained under pressure as weak technical signals, mixed global cues and rupee depreciation concerns weighed on sentiment. Analysts warned that near-term weakness could persist after the benchmark index slipped below key support levels.Commenting on market action, Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities, said the Nifty continued to trade below its 20-hour exponential moving average on Friday, indicating sustained weakness. He noted that the index also closed below the 200-day moving average, signalling that bulls had failed to defend an important long-term support.“As a result, short- to medium-term sentiment is likely to remain weak as long as the index trades below 25,500. On the downside, the decline could extend toward 24,700 in the short term,” De said.Wall Street ended higher overnight, with both the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq extending gains for a fourth straight session as investors positioned themselves ahead of key earnings from large technology companies and an upcoming Federal Reserve policy announcement.Asian markets, however, traded lower after renewed tariff concerns emerged. Sentiment weakened after President Donald Trump threatened to increase tariffs on South Korean goods.On the domestic institutional front, foreign institutional investors were net buyers on Friday, purchasing equities worth Rs 4,113.38 crore. Domestic institutional investors also remained positive, with net purchases of Rs 4,102.56 crore.Meanwhile, pressure on the rupee added to market unease. The local currency recently touched a record low of 92 against the US dollar on January 23, a move expected to raise the cost of imports such as crude oil, electronics, overseas education and foreign travel. The weaker rupee could also intensify inflationary pressures, though exporters may see some benefit.So far this month, the rupee has depreciated by 202 paise, or more than 2 per cent. In 2025, the currency had already fallen 5 per cent amid persistent foreign fund outflows and a strong US dollar.","At 9:50 AM, Nifty50 was trading at 25,144.45,up 95.80 points or 0.38%.

SVB investigations – Need for time bound closures

Provisional assessments – Need for structural changes

Digitalization as the Cornerstone of Compliance Reform

Conclusion - Shifting the Narrative from Rates to Reliability

(Krishan Arora is Partner & Leader, Indirect Tax, India Investment Advisory - Grant Thornton Bharat. With inputs from Ravi Jain, Director, India Investment Advisory - Grant Thornton Bharat)

India customs has seen several reforms over the years – from tariff rationalization to digitization to simplified procedures & schemes to support domestic Industry. While high tariff rates and duty rate rationalization remains a key industry demand, there is a need for a structured next phase focusing towards simplifying regulatory provisions, procedural laws, and leveraging technology for ease of doing business. In this context, the upcoming budget is expected to place significant emphasis on reforms aimed at ease of compliance, accelerating system modernization and procedural simplification.The next phase of customs reform is likely to be driven by faster processes and time-bound resolutions, as delays, uncertainties and administrative cost often outweigh duty impact.SVB investigations and provisional assessments have been a persistent issue which results in prolonged uncertainty for businesses. Despite introducing time bound resolutions, a structured framework is required to make this effective.This is discussed below.Special Valuation Branch (SVB) investigations mechanism currently does not have a prescribed time limit for completion, resulting in prolonged uncertainty for businesses. In numerous cases, investigation has been pending for several years, going beyond a decade in some cases. This adds to compliance burden and hardship for businesses – in terms of continued monitoring of process, submission of data time & again and uncertainty of potential incremental duty burden which can no longer be passed on to customers. Additionally, it also adds to the cost of compliance.It is expected that the government will introduce appropriate provisions in the budget for time bound closure for SVB investigations. The expected move will provide certainty and reduce risk of custom duty becoming a non-transferable cost to businesses.Recently there have also been discussions around revamping the SVB process and introducing a post clearance audit to validate related party customs valuations. It is expected that issues with the current system do not linger on in the new set of procedures, as and when introduced.Budget 2025 took a positive step to introduce a two-year period for finalization of provisional assessments. While this provision is in the right spirit, a framework for tangible action points on behalf of both importers as well as customs officers may be brought in to make this two-year period work in practice.The statute should also provide for a time bound agreement in form of a provisional assessment order culling out responsibilities of importer and customs officer to facilitate finalization of provisional assessment.For instance, in case of classification disputes leading to provisional assessment, importers may be directed to obtain an advance ruling within a specific period for assessment closure. Similarly, in case of valuation issues, customs officers should be entrusted with time bound closures.The period of limitation for issuing notices for assessments is counted from the date of finalized assessment instead of date of filing of bill of entry. As provisional assessments are often pending for years, the actual period covered in potential litigation goes well beyond the statutory limitation of five years. This causes multifold issues for industry including risk of several years going into litigation, requirement of maintenance of records for such number of years as covered in provisional assessments and recurring provision in books of accounts for potential duty liability.To ensure certainty and ease of doing business, the period of limitation should be counted from the date of filing of the bill of entry. This will provide confidence to industry, reduce retrospective duty & interest demands and free up administrative time locked in dispute resolution.While digital systems are used there is still a need to deeply integrate the systems and eliminate manual intervention to reduce operational delays which affect efficiency of businesses.Digital transformation remains central to the customs reform agenda. While the Government has been successful in digitalizing the systems, different platforms with limited interaction have caused significant procedural issues and duplication of efforts for businesses.The Budget is expected to reinforce one unified customs system to further smoothen the process of paperless data submission, further easing clearance process and reduced dwell time.India’s customs reform journey is entering a phase where regulatory stability, procedural simplicity, digital reliability, will be more important than marginal tariff adjustments. A customs framework that is more predictable, transparent, and technology‑enabled will support in improving India’s trade facilitation standards and in supporting the broader objectives of economic growth and global integration.","India customs has seen several reforms over the years – from tariff rationalization to digitization to simplified procedures & schemes to support domestic Industry.

Union Budget 2026: Wishlist for Indian bond investors,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/union-budget-2026-wishlist-for-indian-bond-investors/articleshow/127591734.cms,"Currently, interest earned from bonds is taxed at the investor’s applicable slab rate, unlike equities where a clear distinction exists.

1. Rationalise

TDS on Bond Interest Income

(Coupon)

2. Introduce a Fair and Predictable Tax Regime for Bond Interest

3. Create a Uniform Distribution Framework for Bonds

4. Flattening of the Government Bond yield curve

(Vishal Goenka is Co‑Founder, IndiaBonds)

As India aspires to build a resilient, diversified, and globally competitive financial system, the role of a deep and vibrant bond market cannot be overstated. This is also evident in NITI Aayog’s recent report on ‘Deepening the Corporate Bond Market’ which sets the policy roadmap for next 5 years. Fixed income is not just a portfolio stabiliser for households; it is also the backbone of long‑term capital formation for India’s growth ambitions.Over the past few years, SEBI’s regulatory reforms such as the introduction of Online Bond Platform Providers (OBPPs), electronic bidding platforms, ₹10,000 min. face value for bonds, and improved disclosure standards have laid a strong foundation. However, to truly democratise bond investing and meaningfully increase retail participation, the Union Budget 2026 presents an important opportunity to address a few structural bottlenecks for Indian investors.The introduction of Tax Deducted at Source (TDS) on bond interest income in Union Budget 2023 has unintentionally added friction for retail investors. While the intent was to improve tax compliance, the outcome has been increased complexity in return calculations (XIRR) and cash‑flow mismatches for investors. There was no TDS on interest from listed corporate bonds from 2008 to 2023.Unlike fixed deposits, bond investments often involve secondary market trades, accrued interest adjustments, and varying holding periods.The application of TDS in such cases makes it harder for investors to assess their actual post‑tax returns and increases the operational burden of reconciliation while filing their ITR or writing to companies directly for deductions due via 15G/15H forms.Removing TDS on bond interest income would simplify the investment process, improve transparency in yield computation, and encourage investors without compromising tax collection, as interest income would continue to be fully taxable at the time of filing returns.Currently, interest earned from bonds is taxed at the investor’s applicable slab rate, unlike equities where a clear distinction exists between short‑term and long‑term capital gains with concessional tax rates. In fact, tax on interest from bond investments at slab rate may be even higher than those paid on debt mutual funds at flat 20% This creates an uneven playing field and could discourage long‑term participation in corporate bonds.For many retail investors earning annual returns in the range of 7–12%, slab‑rate taxation significantly erodes post‑tax outcomes, making bonds appear less attractive despite their lower volatility and capital preservation characteristics.A simplified and predictable tax framework—such as a flat tax rate of around 20% on bond interest income would bring parity across asset classes. This would encourage households to allocate more savings to bonds, support long‑term investing behaviour, and help channel domestic capital into India’s growing economy.While mutual funds, equities and insurance products operate under well‑defined, standardised distribution frameworks, bond distribution in India remains fragmented across multiple participant types and channels. This lack of uniformity limits scalability, restricts investor trust, and creates uncertainty for intermediaries.A clear, regulator‑approved distribution framework for corporate bonds—similar to the Authorised Person (AP) structure in equities and AMFI Registration Numbers (ARNs) in mutual funds—can help enforce fit‑and‑proper criteria, define roles and accountability, and standardise disclosure and suitability practices across the industry.For effective transmission of rate cuts by RBI into the economy, flattening of the government bond yield curve is essential. Post RBI rate cuts last year of 125 bps, the 10y bond has barely moved 20bps lower and in fact yields on 15y bonds have moved higher. A lot of this is due to technical supply and deteriorating sentiment due to a weakening rupee. Achievement around fiscal deficit numbers and the government’s future borrowing program would bring the confidence in markets on the longer end of the bond curve and bring yields down. Financial prudence will be closely watched at the budget to encourage the bond market.Union Budget 2026 has the opportunity to send a strong signal: that bonds are not just institutional instruments, but a core part of India’s household investment landscape. Enabling this shift will be critical as India moves towards its next phase of economic growth – Viksit Bharat 2047.","Currently, interest earned from bonds is taxed at the investor’s applicable slab rate, unlike equities where a clear distinction exists.

"‘Europe financing war against themselves’: India-EU FTA, ‘mother of all trade deals’, draws US ire",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/europe-financing-war-against-themselves-india-eu-mother-of-all-trade-deals-draws-us-ire/articleshow/127590019.cms,"Explained: Why India-EU 'Mother Of All Deals' Matters As Trade Talks Enter Final High Stakes Phase

India–EU trade deal near finish line



Tariffs and possible relief



US treasury secretary Scott Bessent attacked the India-EU free trade agreement set to be announced on Tuesday, accusing Europe of indirectly funding the Russia-Ukraine war through energy trade routed via India. The pact has been dubbed as ""mother of all deal,"" by both Indian and European leaders.The senior aide to President Trump said European governments were undermining their own security stance by buying refined oil products from India that originate from Russian crude, while Washington continues to impose punitive tariffs on New Delhi for the same reason.Speaking to ABC News, Bessent defended the Trump administration’s decision to slap steep tariffs on Indian goods, linking them directly to India’s energy trade with Moscow.“We have put 25 per cent tariffs on India for buying Russian oil. Guess what happened last week? The Europeans signed a trade deal with India,” he said.Bessent added, “And just to be clear again, the Russian oil goes into India, the refined products come out, and the Europeans buy the refined products. They are financing the war against themselves.”Also read: India, EU finalise FTA, deal set to be announced today The remarks came as leaders from India and the EU are set to formally announce the conclusion of negotiations on a comprehensive free trade agreement at a high-level summit on Tuesday, marking the end of talks that lasted for 18 years.The announcement is being made as European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and European Council President António Costa are in India on a state visit and were also the chief guest at the country's 77th Republic Day celebrations.Bessent framed the issue as a mismatch in burden-sharing between the US and its allies, arguing that while Washington has pushed for energy decoupling from Moscow and imposed tariffs, Europe continues to benefit from what he described as loopholes in global oil trade.He said President Trump had borne a disproportionate economic and political cost while working to negotiate a settlement to the Russia–Ukraine conflict, adding that under Trump’s leadership, “we will eventually end the war.”Earlier at Davos during World Economic Forum, Bessent had made a similar argument calling Europe buying refined products from India “ an act of stupidity.”India’s commerce secretary Rajesh Agrawal confirmed on Monday that India and the EU have concluded negotiations on a free trade agreement covering goods, services and other areas of cooperation.“It will be a balanced, forward-looking deal for better economic integration with the EU. It will propel trade and investment between both sides,” Agrawal said.Commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal in January had said the free trade agreement between India and EU, where negotiations are in the final phase, will be the ""mother of all deals"" signed by the country so far.Later, European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen in an address at the World Economic Forum in Davos last Tuesday called the potential deal between India-EU as ""mother of all deals.""""I will travel to India. There is still work to do. But we are on the cusp of a historic trade agreement. Some call it the mother of all deals. One that would create a market of 2 billion people, accounting for almost a quarter of global GDP,"" she said.Officials said the agreement, which got fresh momentum in 2024 amid global trade realignments, including Trump’s reciprocal tariff policies, would provide zero-duty or preferential access for a wide range of Indian exports. These include textiles, leather, marine products, chemicals, gems and jewellery, electrical machinery, footwear and automobiles. In return, India is expected to offer concessions in sectors such as automobiles, wines and spirits.European commissioner for trade and economic security Maros Sefcovic said the aim was to achieve full or partial tariff reductions on 97–99 per cent of goods, while accounting for sensitivities in agriculture and dairy. He said the EU was seeking a combination of lower tariffs on a specified number of vehicles along with phased reductions, noting that the auto sector was complementary for both sides.“We are looking at the way which would help us find solutions, create new supply chains and make an even better business case for European car makers, while opening new possibilities for cooperation,” Sefcovic said, underlining the agreement’s strategic goal of building resilient supply chains and reducing risky dependencies.The deal is expected to take several months to be legally vetted and ratified by the European Parliament and could come into force in early 2027.EU's top diplomat and vice-presidnet, Kaja Kallas, on Tuesday while holding delgation level talks with defence minister Rajnath Singh to finalise India-EU security and tarde partnership said, ""Thank you very much for welcoming us and yesterday, Republic Day was quite an experience. Thank you for that as well...It was a proud moment to see that our operations were also a part of this parade. It shows how we have been able to work together. The signing of the security and defence partnership is a milestone, and we can build on that. There is so much more we can work together on in the multilateral fora, as well as bilaterally, to further develop defence cooperation. I really look forward to our discussions today and further cooperation in the future.""The Trump administration has imposed tariffs of up to 50 per cent on Indian goods, including a 25 per cent levy linked directly to India’s purchases of Russian oil, with measures doubled in August. However, Bessent has recently suggested there could be a path to easing these tariffs.Speaking to Politico on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum, he said Indian refinery purchases of Russian crude had fallen sharply.“Indian purchases by their refineries of Russian oil have collapsed. So that is a success. The tariffs are still on, 25 per cent tariffs for Russian oil are still on. I would imagine there is a path to take them off,” Bessent said.Reuters data shows India’s Russian oil imports in December fell to their lowest level in two years, while the share of oil sourced from OPEC producers rose to an 11-month high.","US treasury secretary Scott Bessent attacked the India-EU free trade agreement set to be announced on Tuesday.

"India’s move to decarbonise cement, aluminium sectors may help it navigate the EU’s carbon border tax in due course",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/indias-move-to-decarbonise-cement-aluminium-sectors-may-help-it-navigate-the-eus-carbon-border-tax-in-due-course/articleshow/127596539.cms,"File photo

NEW DELHI: In a move that may help India's high-emission industries navigate the EU's carbon border tax regime by adopting clean manufacturing processes in due course, Niti Aayog, the govt think tank, has come up with comprehensive roadmaps for decarbonisation of aluminium and cement sectors. This will also contribute to the country achieving its long-term net-zero emission (carbon neutrality) goal for 2070.The EU's carbon border tax -- Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) -- is a tool to put a price on high-emission goods such as cement, aluminium, iron & steel and fertilisers that enter the 27 EU nations.If India does not take steps to decarbonise these sectors, they will continue to attract tariff burden in the form of carbon border tax, impacting the country’s exports.The decarbonisation roadmaps for cement and aluminium, released by Niti Aayog last Wednesday, will also serve as reference manuals for India to decarbonise other sectors, in sync with the country's climate action commitments under the Paris Agreement.The Aayog’s report shows that cement manufacturing, a significant source of carbon emissions, contributed roughly 2.4 GtCO2e of emissions worldwide in 2023.India’s production of cement resulted in roughly 246 MtCO2e of emissions, which was around 6% of national GHG emissions.Under the decarbonisation strategy, as suggested by the roadmap, the cement sector will reduce its carbon intensity from 0.63 tCO₂e per tonne of cement to approximately 0.09-0.13tCO₂e per tonne by 2070.To enable deep decarbonisation in this sector, the roadmap proposes to prioritise the use of refuse-derived fuels, clinker substitution, scale-up of Carbon Capture, Utilisation and Storage (CCUS) and effective implementation of carbon credit trading scheme.Similarly, the decarbonisation roadmap for aluminium sector identifies a three-phase solution: transition to renewable energy-round the clock (RE-RTC), enhanced grid connectivity in the short term and adoption of nuclear power in the medium term, and long-term integration of CCUS.The report reveals that production of aluminium accounted for about 2.8% of India's total GHG emissions in 2023.","Niti Aayog, the govt think tank, has come up with comprehensive roadmaps for decarbonisation of aluminium and cement sectors.

As India's startup ecosystem matures, Employee Stock Option Plans (ESOPs) continue to be one of the most effective tools for attracting and retaining talent. For young companies operating with limited cash flows, ESOPs help balance ambition with affordability. However, how these stock options are taxed continues to play a decisive role in how valuable they are for employees.ESOPs are generally taxed first as salary at the time of exercise of options and again as capital gains at the time of sale of shares. Since at the point of exercise, the tax is levied on a notional gain (fair market value of the shares minus the price paid by the employee), it creates a liquidity crunch for the employees. To address this challenge, govt in 2020 introduced a targeted tax relief for employees of eligible startups to ease liquidity mismatch caused by ESOPs taxation at exercise.The benefit is applicable only for employees of eligible startups under Section 80IAC of the Income-tax Act, which prescribes conditions such as being incorporated as a Private Limited Company or LLP between April 1, 2016 and March 31, 2030, being less than 10 years old, having annual turnover not exceeding Rs 100 crore in any year since incorporation, certification from an inter-ministerial board, etc.Under this provision, when an employee of an eligible startup exercises ESOPs, the tax arising at that stage is not required to be paid/deducted by the employer immediately. Instead, the tax is deferred and becomes payable within 14 days from the earliest of the following events:While the intent behind the provision is widely appreciated, the benefit of ESOP tax deferral remains limited to a small pool of startups, specifically those recognised by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) and certified by the inter-ministerial board.Currently, although nearly 197,000 startups are recognised by DPIIT, only a little over 3,700 are eligible to extend the relief to their employees.Startups today operate in an intensely competitive talent market, particularly in sectors such as technology, artificial intelligence, fintech and deep-tech. Cash compensation alone is often insufficient to attract and retain skilled professionals, making ESOPs a critical part of compensation structures.Looking ahead to the Budget, the priority should be on reforms that make ESOPs more practical and genuinely valuable for startup employees. One of the key measures would be to extend tax deferral to all DPIIT-recognised startups.In addition to startups, extending the tax-payment deferral benefit to all unlisted companies would go a long way in making ESOPs a far more attractive component of employee compensation.A broader objective should be to align tax payment more closely with genuine liquidity events, such as sale of shares or listings, wherever feasible.Collectively, these steps would help transform ESOPs into a true long-term wealth-creation mechanism rather than a short-term financial burden.","Employee Stock Option Plans (ESOPs) continue to be one of the most effective tools for attracting and retaining talent.

Gold price prediction

today:

are touching new record highs due to heightened geopolitical tensions, says Praveen Singh, Senior Fundamental Research Analyst- Currencies and Commodities at Mirae Asset Sharekhan.

Here’s his outlook on gold prices:

Gold Performance:

In the week ending January 16, the spot gold surged nearly 2% to close at $4595. The rally in the week came on the heels of a sharp 4.6% rise in the week ending January 9.

Driven by safe haven demand as the US President on January 17 threatened 8 EU nations with 10% tariffs beginning February 1 in retaliation to their opposition to his Greenland plans, the yellow metal extended its rally to a fresh record high of $4690 on January 19.

At the time of writing this article, the shiny metal was changing hands at $4672 (MCX February contract Rs 145,500), up 1.67% for the day.

ETF and COMEX gold inventory:

As of January 16, total known global gold ETF holdings stood at 99.86 MOz, highest since August 2022, and are up nearly 1% YTD, as holdings rose for the second straight week.

Registered COMEX gold inventory at 18.86 MOz, is up around 1 MOz from the cycle low of 17.86 MOz but is down over 22% from the record peak of 24.25 MOz seen on April 7.

The US Dollar Index fell around 0.15% to 99.08 on January 19 after rising for three straight weeks.Two-year and ten-year treasury yields jumped nearly 2% last week as the US President expressed doubt over the appointment of Kevin Hassett, a key proponent of lower rate policy. Trump wants to keep him at the White House.The US Bond market was closed on January 19 to observe Martin Luther King Jr Holiday.Trump rattled NATO allies over the weekend after threatening to impose 10% tariffs on 8 EU nations starting February 1 if he doesn’t get control of Greenland.Tariffs will be increased to 25% from June 1. The proposed tariff will be due and payable until a deal is reached for complete and total purchase of Greenland.US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said that Europe was too weak to ensure Greenland’s security in an interview on Sunday.International Monetary Fund Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva said it’s too early to gauge the economic impact of tensions over Greenland, though it could be a headwind for growth.EU ambassadors met on Sunday to discuss options if Trump follows through with his threats. They are considering €93 billion ($108 billion) worth of American goods. The bloc’s leaders are due to meet for an emergency summit on Thursday.The European Union is once again weighing whether to use its most powerful economic weapon — the anti-coercion instrument (ACI) — in a dispute with a major trading partner. The instrument allows the EU to deploy an array of measures in response to coercive trade tactics. It may include new fees on EU imports of US goods and services, curbs on US investments in Europe or a ban on American firms bidding for public contracts.The pending US Supreme Court ruling on some of Trump’s earlier tariffs may come as soon as Tuesday.President Trump will address the annual World Economic Forum in Davos this week and may offer details of home ownership plans for helping Americans buy homes by making it possible to take money out of their 401(K)s and use that for downpayment.Bloomberg reported that respondents in a World Economic Forum survey identify 'geoeconomic confrontation' and 'state-based armed conflict' as the two biggest risks to the global backdrop in 2026.As per Axios, the US officials plan to focus on economic growth, home ownership and peace through strength at WEF, Davos.China’s data released on January 19 showed that China’s economy grew 4.5% on an annualized basis in Q4 2025 vs 4.4% expected. China’s retail sales hit a 3-year low in December, trailing the forecast. Similarly, China’s industrial production, fixed asset investment (December) trailed their respective forecasts.Last week’s data showed that US CPI (December), despite expectations of coming out to be hot on downward adjustments in the November CPI data, was tame. CPI y-o-y was up 2.7% (forecast 2.7%, prior 2.7%). The core CPI also rose 2.7% y-o-y (forecast 2.7%, prior 2.7%). Retail sales advance was up 0.6% m-o-m Vs the estimate of 0.5% and prior reading of -0.1%), while retail sales control group up 0.4% (forecast 0.4%, prior 0.6%).PPI final demand data were hotter than expected though.Industrial production data, released on Friday, was up 0.4% m-o-m (forecast 0.1%) in December.Major US data on the deck this week include 3Q GDP final reading (January 22), real personal spending (January 22), PCE Price Index (January 22) and S&P Global US PMIs, University of Michigan consumer sentiment and inflation expectations (January 23).Major Eurozone data to be released this week include CPI (January 19), services and composite PMIs (January 23). The UK’s CPI (January 21), services and composite PMIs (January 23) will also be monitored by investors.Fresh escalation in geopolitical tensions over Greenland as Trump threatens the EU nations with tariffs to achieve his goal is an unexpected development which is supporting gold prices. Heightened worries and repercussions may also affect global trade and economy. Otherwise, gold could have come under pressure due to diminishing possibility of Hassett becoming the next Fed Chair, a firmer US Dollar and thawing geopolitical tensions as Iran strike had been averted.Still, US Supreme Court ruling over Trump’s tariffs may create huge short-term volatility as his tariffs may be lacking legal basis, though the Trump Administration could resort to other clauses to keep most of the tariffs in place.Trump extending the EU tariff deadline will also weigh on the yellow metal.Spot gold may test resistance around $4750 (MCX February contract Rs 148,000) amid elevated US-EU tariff tensions.However, considering the risks involved, buyers are urged to exercise caution and to put suitable stoploss. Support is at $4608 (Rs 143,500)/$4560 (Rs 142,000). Interim resistance is at $4707 (Rs 146,500).Spot silver surged over 12% in the week ending January 16 as it closed at $89.94 on January 16.Shanghai Gold Exchange Silver price (T+D) at 23271 CNY/Kg is equivalent to around $104/Oz.US imposing tariffs on EU means that the expected flow of silver inventories from COMEX warehouses to LBMA warehouses will be disrupted, which will tighten the spot market.Spot silver, currently at $94.42 (MCX March contract Rs 309,660), up nearly 5% for the day, is expected to trade with a positive bias that will strengthen should the metal closes above $94 mark for two straight days. It may rise to test the resistance zone of $98-$100 (MCX March contract Rs 321,000-Rs 328,000). However, as mentioned earlier in the gold section, utmost caution is needed with a suitable stoploss in place. Support is at $90 (Rs 295,000)/$86 (Rs 282,000).","Gold prices touching new record highs due to heightened geopolitical tensions, says Praveen Singh, Senior Fundamental Research Analyst- Currencies and Commodities at Mirae Asset Sharekhan.

American Oil Giants ‘PULL BACK’ From Trump’s $100,000,000,000 Venezuela Dream Project

UAE firm Al Habtoor plans legal action against Lebanon over $1.7 billion investment losses,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/uae-firm-al-habtoor-plans-legal-action-against-lebanon-over-1-7-billion-investment-losses/articleshow/127566752.cms,"Photo credit- AP

A Dubai-based conglomerate has said it will initiate legal action against Lebanese authorities, alleging losses of more than $1.7 billion following years of economic crisis, banking restrictions and political instability in Lebanon.The Al Habtoor Group said on Monday that its investments in Lebanon have suffered “severe and sustained harm” due to measures imposed by Lebanese authorities and the country’s central bank, which prevented the group from freely accessing and transferring funds deposited in local banks.The group’s businesses in Lebanon were badly hit by the country’s historic economic collapse that began in late 2019, as well as by the 14-month Israel-Hezbollah war. The World Bank has estimated the cost of reconstruction and recovery from the conflict at around $11 billion.Lebanon’s prolonged financial crisis, rooted in decades of corruption and mismanagement, has left individuals and companies unable to access their own savings trapped in the banking system.Al Habtoor Group operates several assets in Lebanon, including the Metropolitan Palace Hotel in a Beirut suburb and Habtoor Land, a large theme park east of the capital.Last year, the group had reversed earlier plans to dismantle the Metropolitan Palace Hotel.In a statement, the conglomerate said the damage to its assets and properties in Lebanon exceeds $1.7 billion, blaming not only banking restrictions but also the wider political, economic, financial and social crises, as well as the failure of the Lebanese state to provide a stable and secure investment environment.While reiterating that it remains open to “lawful and constructive solutions” that would fully restore its rights, the group said it has exhausted all good-faith efforts to resolve the dispute amicably.“As a result, the group has no other alternative but to advance this matter further and proceed to take all legal measures necessary to protect and enforce its rights under applicable international agreements and legal frameworks,” it said, without specifying where the legal action would be filed.Officials at the Lebanese prime minister’s office were not immediately available for comment.The move comes at a time when Lebanon has been seeking to repair ties with oil-rich Gulf countries after years of strained relations linked to the influence of Hezbollah. The militant group was severely weakened during its latest war with Israel, which ended with a US-brokered ceasefire in November 2024.Lebanon has since installed a new president and prime minister, both of whom have pledged to fight corruption and stabilise the country’s battered economy.","Al Habtoor Group says its investments in Lebanon have suffered “severe and sustained harm’ The Dubai-based conglomerate alleges losses of more than $1.7 billion following years of economic crisis, banking restrictions and political instability in Lebanon.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127566722,imgsize-1333492,width-400,resizemode-4/-.jpg"

The disclosures included tax information of President Trump and thousands of other high-income individuals.Court filings said Littlejohn deliberately sought a contractor role to gain access to Trump’s tax returns and methodically learned how to extract data without raising internal alarms.The Treasury Department said it currently holds 31 contracts with Booz Allen Hamilton, involving annual spending of $4.8 million and total obligations of $21 million.Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said the contracts were ended because the firm “failed to implement adequate safeguards to protect sensitive data, including the confidential taxpayer information it had access to through its contracts with the Internal Revenue Service”.The move effectively cuts Booz Allen off from Treasury-related work linked to taxpayer data.A representative of Booz Allen Hamilton was not immediately available for comment, as reported AP.","The decision comes amid broader efforts by the Trump administration to act against entities it views as having failed to protect the president’s interests or sensitive government information.

Yen rebound hits Japanese exporters

Mixed performance across Asian markets

US futures dip amid tariff uncertainty

Wall Street ends week mixed

Commodities jump as investors seek safety

Asian stock markets mostly declined on Monday, led by sharp losses in Japan after the yen strengthened against the US dollar, hurting exporter stocks.Japan’s benchmark Nikkei 225 fell 1.8% to 52,870.15, weighed down by heavy selling in major exporters such as Toyota Motor Corp., whose shares dropped 4%.Markets across the region remained cautious amid currency volatility, uncertainty over US trade policies and ahead of a key US Federal Reserve policy decision later this week.The sell-off in Japan came after the yen staged a strong rebound against the dollar in recent days. A weaker yen typically supports Japanese exporters by boosting the value of overseas earnings, but the recent currency move reversed that advantage.The dollar slipped to 154.27 yen from 155.01 yen, after trading near 158 yen last week, reported AP.The move followed comments from Japanese and US officials signalling close coordination on currency movements, fuelling expectations of possible intervention to support the yen.“Intervention chatter did the trick.

Which airports and airlines have been most affected so far?

What should you do if your flight is cancelled?

Will the airline rebook you on another flight?

Are you entitled to a refund if your flight is cancelled?

Will airlines cover meals or accommodation during delays or cancellations?

How can passengers reach airline support more easily during major disruptions?

US air travel is seeing widespread disruptions as a powerful winter storm moves across large parts of the country, forcing at least 13,000 flight cancellations over the weekend and affecting major airports. Forecasters have warned that damage, particularly in areas hit by ice, could be catastrophic and comparable to a hurricane.By mid-morning on Saturday, flight cancellations had dominated departures from several major airports, with Memphis, Oklahoma City and Dallas–Fort Worth among the worst affected. Significant disruption was also reported in Austin, Charlotte and Nashville, while airports in Washington and New York were expected to see conditions worsen as the storm continued.Here is what you need to know:When airlines anticipate weather-related disruption, they often allow passengers to postpone trips by a few days without paying a change fee. For example, American Airlines is waiving change fees for passengers impacted by the storm and adding extra flights across the country to help travellers reach their destinations once conditions improve.Travellers are advised to search online for their airline’s name along with terms such as “travel alerts” to check for rescheduling offers.In case passengers need to proceed, they should use their airline’s app to confirm whether their flight is still operating before leaving for the airport. Cancellations can be announced hours or even days before departure.By mid-day Saturday, American Airlines and Delta Air Lines had each cancelled more than 1,000 scheduled Sunday flights, according to FlightAware. Oklahoma’s largest airport suspended all flights on Saturday. Dallas–Fort Worth International Airport saw more than 700 departing flights cancelled and nearly as many arriving flights called off. Disruptions were also reported at airports in Chicago, Atlanta, Nashville and Charlotte, North Carolina.Passengers at the airport should speak to a customer service representative. Those at home or in a hotel should contact the airline online or by phone. Travellers are encouraged to research alternative flights while waiting to speak to an agent.Most airlines will rebook passengers on a later flight at no additional charge, depending on seat availability. However, though most major carriers, say they can rebook passengers on partner airlines, this is not guaranteed.Yes. If a flight is cancelled and the passenger no longer wants to travel, or has found another way to reach the destination, the airline is legally required to issue a refund, even for non-refundable tickets. The reason for the cancellation does not matter.Passengers are entitled to a full ticket refund, as well as refunds for unused baggage fees, seat upgrades or other extras. Airlines may offer travel credits, but passengers are entitled to a cash refund.According to the US Department of Transportation, refunds for credit card payments must be issued within seven business days after a passenger declines an alternative flight or voucher. Refunds for tickets purchased with cash or cheque must be issued within 20 calendar days.US airlines are not required to compensate passengers for meals or lodging when flights are cancelled or significantly delayed due to an “uncontrollable” event such as bad weather.Customer service phone lines are often overwhelmed during major storms. Travellers can try using priority phone numbers linked to higher frequent-flyer status or calling an airline’s international support number, where agents can often assist with rebooking.","US air travel is seeing widespread disruptions as a powerful winter storm moves across large parts of the country.

The US Federal Reserve is widely expected to keep interest rates unchanged when it meets in the coming week, holding firm despite President Donald Trump's pressure to slash levels as it guards against threats to its independence.The central bank has cut rates three consecutive times since September as the jobs market weakened, bringing them to a range between 3.50 percent and 3.75 percent.But Fed Chair Jerome Powell has signaled the bar would be higher for a further reduction in January. They meet on Tuesday and Wednesday.""The fact that growth is strong, unemployment is low, equity markets are close to all-time highs and inflation is above target all argue for a pause,"" said analysts at ING bank.Powell's robust defense of Fed independence in response to ongoing pressure from Trump to lower rates confirms this, ING added.On January 11, Powell released a rare, solemn statement revealing that the Department of Justice was investigating him over a $2.5 billion renovation of the bank's headquarters.He slammed the threat of criminal charges as the result of policymakers setting rates in the public's best interests -- rather than bowing to the president's wishes.Trump has made no secret of his disdain for Powell, claiming there is ""no inflation"" and repeatedly questioning the Fed chair's competence and integrity.Yet, US inflation has been well above the bank's two-percent target for over five years, said former Cleveland Fed president Loretta Mester.""I think the Fed needs to keep a pretty tight eye on where the inflation is going,"" she told AFP.Price increases could cool after Trump's trade tariffs filter through the world's biggest economy, but Mester flagged the need for ""more convincing evidence.""Meanwhile, existing cost hikes have brought about a ""large wedge"" between how affluent and lower-income households view the economy, said KPMG chief economist Diane Swonk.Even if the gap could temporarily narrow as fiscal stimulus hits in early 2026 -- with a rise in tax refunds incoming due to tax cut expansions -- this could ""cause a more entrenched bout of inflation,"" she warned.Another complication is stagnating employment, forcing policymakers to walk a tightrope between lowering rates to boost the economy and keeping them higher to curb inflation.The Fed meets eight times a year to consider interest rate levels, and Michael Pearce of Oxford Economics said the dilemma it faces has eased.Figures suggest that risks to the labor market appear less pressing than a few months ago, while the likelihood of rising inflation also seems to have moderated, he said in a note.Nonetheless, events outside of the rate-setting committee ""have the potential to shake up the path of monetary policy,"" Pearce added.Besides the probe into Powell, Trump has sought to fire Fed Governor Lisa Cook, sparking a legal battle crucial to shaping how much discretion the president has in changing the Fed's leadership.A president can only fire Fed board members ""for cause,"" traditionally understood to mean malfeasance or dereliction of duty.But the Trump administration appears to be pushing a broader interpretation, as Trump moved to fire Cook over mortgage fraud allegations she denies.The Supreme Court heard arguments on the issue on Wednesday, and Cook stressed in a statement afterwards the importance of insulating the Fed from political threats.She said her case is about whether the Fed will set rates ""guided by evidence and independent judgment or will succumb to political pressure.""Pearce flagged a ""small risk"" that the government succeeds in ousting Cook, saying this could ""pave the way for a substantial dovish transformation on the committee over time.""Policymakers seen as ""hawkish"" favor higher rates to fight inflation, while a ""dovish"" Fed tends towards lower levels.Analysts expect Powell to avoid discussing political issues at his press briefing after the two-day Fed meeting on Wednesday, while divisions remain over the path of future policy.","The US Federal Reserve is widely expected to keep interest rates unchanged when it meets in the coming week.

Trump Threatens Canada With 100% Tariff Over China Trade Push After Carney’s Beijing Visit

: US President Donald Trump threatened to impose a 100 per cent tax on Canada if it strikes a trade deal with China, reversing his position last week when he said he was okay with such a trade deal.In a social media post on Saturday, Trump appeared to have changed his mind while lashing out at Canadian PM Mark Carney, saying “if he thinks he is going to make Canada a 'Drop Off Port' for China to send goods and products into the United States, he is sorely mistaken.”“China will eat Canada alive, completely devour it, including the destruction of their businesses, social fabric, and general way of life. If Canada makes a deal with China, it will immediately be hit with a 100% Tariff against all Canadian goods and products coming into the U.S.A,” Trump said, referring to the Canadian PM as “Governor Carney.”Trump’s threat follows a remarkable address by Carney to global leaders at Davos where the Canadian PM raised the banner of revolt against U.S hegemony, warning that in a world of great power rivalry, the countries in between have a choice: to compete with each other for favor or to combine to create a third path with impact.“Middle powers must act together because if we are not at the table, we are on the menu,” Carney said in an address that was widely acclaimed across the world.The open swipe at the U.S appears to have enraged Trump, who only last week had said if Carney struck a deal with China – which he did when he visited Beijing ahead of Davos – he should do it and he (Trump) was okay with it.But at Davos, where Carney was the toast of the global leadership, the U.S President turned sour, complaining that Canada gets many ""freebies"" from the US and ""should be grateful,"" and Carney's remarks showed he ""wasn't so grateful.""“Canada lives because of the United States,” Trump said in remarks that offended many Canadians and provoked Carney to retort that ""Canada does not ‘live because of the United States.’ Canada thrives because we are Canadian.""""We are masters in our own house. This is our country. This is our future. The choice is ours,” Carney asserted, stating that Canada must be a ""beacon"" in an era of ""democratic decline” and arguing that Canada’s success is built on values like inclusivity and diversity, a swipe at Trumpian America that believes whites are being displaced and sidelined by immigration.Trump has previously talked about making Canada the 51st state, and this week he posted an altered image of a map of the US that included Canada, Greenland, Venezuela and Cuba as part of its territory. The trolling has taken its toll of two centuries of amicable U.S-Canada ties that has resulted in the longest and mostly unguarded border in the world.A 100 per cent tariff on Canadian goods and products will be devastating for Ottawa, which is Washington's second largest trade partner after Mexico. For the full year of 2025, total bilateral trade in goods and services is estimated to have crossed $900 billion, racking up a surplus of more than $85 billion.",US President Donald Trump threatened to impose a 100 per cent tax on Canada if it strikes a trade deal with China.

Can Donald Trump’s mortgage bond push lower home loan rates? New Fannie–Freddie limits reignite risk debate,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/can-donald-trumps-mortgage-bond-push-lower-home-loan-rates-new-fanniefreddie-limits-reignite-risk-debate/articleshow/127409921.cms,"Cap hike revives post-crisis risk concerns



Political pressure meets market scepticism



Pulte’s tenure under scrutiny



The Trump administration has quietly expanded the scope for government-backed mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to buy far more mortgage bonds than previously allowed, a move aimed at lowering home loan rates but one that has revived concerns about financial risk and policy overreach.According to an internal email obtained by the Associated Press, the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA), under director Bill Pulte, has lifted portfolio caps that earlier limited Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to holding no more than $40 billion each in mortgage bonds. The January 12 directive raises that ceiling to $225 billion apiece, effective immediately, AP reported.If fully utilised, the change would allow the two lenders to increase bond purchases by roughly $170 billion beyond the $200 billion buying programme President Donald Trump had publicly ordered to push mortgage rates lower.The move effectively reverses nearly two decades of bipartisan policy consensus put in place after the 2008–09 financial crisis, when excessive risk-taking by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac forced a government bailout and placed both firms under federal conservatorship.While both entities remain subject to a broader Treasury cap of $450 billion on mortgage investment portfolios, analysts say the new flexibility allows them to adopt a far more aggressive approach to bond buying, potentially increasing systemic risk.Neither Pulte nor the FHFA clarified whether Trump or Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent was consulted before the caps were raised. After the report surfaced, Pulte dismissed it as “fake news” on X, saying FHFA had merely given “legal flexibility” and that the firms would not exceed $200 billion in purchases.Following publication, the agency issued an additional statement saying, “Fannie and Freddie will not be allowed to go beyond the president’s buy.”The expansion comes amid heightened political pressure to show progress on mortgage affordability ahead of US midterm elections. However, lawmakers and economists remain sceptical that bond purchases alone can sustainably lower rates without addressing housing supply constraints.“This is just a smoke screen for Trump and Bill Pulte to tweet about — it will do little, if anything, to lower mortgage interest rates over the long term and raises questions about increased risks to Fannie and Freddie,” said Senator Elizabeth Warren, the top Democrat on the Senate banking committee.Housing experts also note that any temporary dip in borrowing costs could simply translate into higher home prices if supply remains tight.Edward Pinto of the American Enterprise Institute described Trump’s initial bond-buying plan as a “sugar high,” adding that “it may have an effect, but it will be fleeting.”The episode adds to scrutiny of Bill Pulte’s unusually high-profile tenure at FHFA, a role traditionally kept out of political spotlight. Pulte has appointed himself chair of both Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, overseen senior management firings, and pushed controversial policy ideas, including a 50-year mortgage proposal that critics say would sharply raise long-term borrowing costs.The FHFA email instructed the two firms to increase bond investments to “exert meaningful downward pressure” on mortgage rates, and notably said that the “commencement of increases” would not require prior agency approval — a point that has raised further alarm among market watchers.“It's easy for the federal government to make a mistake here. They've done it in the past,” said Jim Parrott, a former National Economic Council official under President Barack Obama.With mortgage rates once again a political flashpoint, critics warn that loosening constraints on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac risks reopening old fault lines in the US housing finance system, even as the long-term impact on affordability remains uncertain.","Government-backed mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac can buy far more mortgage bonds than previously allowed.

US Says 25% Tariff Forced India Oil Shift, Signals Removal, Slams EU Silence On Russian Crude

: US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent signaled a prospective removal of the 25 per cent penalty tariffs on India for its purchase of Russian oil, citing “success” in Washington’s pressure tactics while appearing to disapprove the outreach of the European Union, which is on the verge of concluding a Free Trade Agreement with New Delhi.""We put 25 per cent tariffs on India for buying Russian oil, and the Indian purchases by their refineries of Russian oil have collapsed. So that is a success. The tariffs are still on. I would imagine there is a path to take them off, so that's a check and a huge success,"" Bessent said in remarks at Davos, even as the US and India continued efforts to narrow gaps to conclude their own trade agreement.Bessent noted that pre-Ukraine invasion, Russia supplied only 2-3% of India's oil, which rose into the high teens but has now come down due to the US pressure via tariffs. By some estimates, there has been a 29% month-on-month reduction in Russian crude imports by India—going down to their lowest levels since 2022, but not reaching zero.He also contrasted this approach with that of Europe, criticizing the EU for not imposing similar tariffs on New Delhi and instead buying refined Russian oil products from India, calling it an ""ultimate act of irony and stupidity"" for indirectly funding Moscow’s war effort.Some critics have pointed out that the US itself was buying Russian uranium till very recently and the Trump administration’s deference towards Russia on the Ukraine issue is not helping end the war either.Bessent’s remarks came even as the EU and India are on the verge of concluding a free trade agreement that has been in the works for nearly 20 years, a development that appeared to irk Washington, which is on the rampage against rest of the world claiming the US has been “ripped off.”In a separate development, President Trump lashed out at Canada for its recent trade deals with China, threatening a 100 per cent tariff against Ottawa for turning itself into a “drop-off port” for channeling Chinese goods into the US.While Bessent held out the possibility of removing the Russian oil tariffs on India, his colleague commerce secretary Howard Lutnick, suggested last week that the U.S-India trade deal was held up because Prime Minister Narendra Modi had not picked up the phone to call President Trump.But New Delhi has rejected the claim, saying PM Modi had spoken to the President at least three or four times since op sindoor to discuss a wide range of issues. The Indian side acknowledged that he did not discuss the nitty-gritty of the trade deal, because under the Indian system, it is the officials’ remit; the prime minister does not negotiate the details.PM Modi will be happy to call President Trump when the trade deal is concluded, they said, while not putting a timeline on its conclusion.",US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent signaled a prospective removal of the 25 per cent penalty tariffs on India for its purchase of Russian oil.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground.Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change, too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain and boost vendor partnerships ahead of a stock market debut planned for 2025.The Series E round was done via a combination of fresh equity and conversion of debt, the Bangalore-based company said in a statement Thursday. The round was led by M&G Plc and existing investors including Lightspeed Venture Partners and DST Global participated.The round “fully funds our business plan,” Vaibhav Gupta, Udaan co-founder and chief executive officer, said in the statement. “It enables our continued journey of growth and profitability, positioning us well to be public-market ready in the next 12-18 months.”Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, runs an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business, though a very small part of India’s overall retail market, is expected to swell to $150 billion in sales in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co.The startup targets an initial public offering in 2025, though it’s yet to decide whether it will do so in India or overseas, Gupta told Bloomberg News last month.Udaan was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran the company until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021.

The Series A funding round was led by Lightspeed Venture Partners, and participants included Silicon Valley billionaire Vinod Khosla’s Khosla Ventures and Peak XV Partners, formerly Sequoia Capital India & Southeast Asia, Sarvam said Thursday.The Bangalore-based startup, until recently in stealth mode, was co-founded by Vivek Raghavan and Pratyush Kumar.

The startup has a total of 18 employees and is just opening an office in the city.""What we are showing is that you can build large language models with limited resources,” Raghavan said in a phone interview. ""We are building at a smaller scale and demonstrating that these can be extremely cost and energy efficient so they can be accessed by everyone.""Large language models, like OpenAI’s GPT-4 and Meta Platforms Inc.’s Llama, are powerful AI systems that understand by learning from vast amounts of diverse data from the internet and elsewhere to summarize, translate, and create text, audio and video for a wide range of applications.

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Startups will play an important role in helping India become the third largest economy in the world, Chief Economic Advisor (CEA) to the Union government V Anantha Nageswaran has said.Nageswaran said that tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country due to improvements in infrastructure and supportive policies of the government, according to a KSUM release.The CEA, during his Leadership Talk on the concluding day of the Huddle Global 2023 organised by the Kerala Startup Mission (KSUM), said that India was the fifth largest economy on course to become the third largest in a few years.""In fact, I will say 7-in-7 is the buzz slogan, that is 7 trillion USD economy in seven years. Seven trillion USD economy size by 2030 is possible if India maintains its present growth trajectory, and in that journey startup entrepreneurs are going to play an important role,"" he is quoted as having said in the release.He was of the view that the active participation of startups in India in developing business models on the foundation of expanding physical and digital infrastructure will continue to generate efficiency, revenue and economic returns for the country.""The last decade has seen an exceptional transformation in the startup landscape in India, which has emerged as the third largest ecosystem globally, with over 1.12 lakh startups presently recognised by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) across 763 districts.""Among them, more than 110 are unicorns with a total valuation of around USD 350 billion,"" he said.The CEA further said that the country ranks second in innovation quality.He said that innovation in India was not just limited to certain sectors as startups were solving problems in 56 industrial sectors, with 13 per cent of them from IT services, nine per cent from health and life sciences, seven per cent from education, five per cent from agriculture and five per cent from food and beverages.Nageswaran also said it was significant that 49 per cent of the startups were from tier-2 and 3 cities which have turned to be game-changers as the business advantages in these locations enable entrepreneurs to operate at lower costs as compared to tier-1 cities.""Apart from improved infrastructure and the government's pro-active policies, the availability of a technically skilled talent pool is a huge advantage for startups to set up and flourish in tier-2 and tier-3 cities,"" he said.He said that historically there was a perception that small towns were difficult places to conduct business.""...but with improved internet penetration, vastly better physical infrastructure, road, rail and air connectivity and supportive government policies, this is no longer true,"" he said.He also noted Kerala's startup journey has been an inspiring one.The CEA said that KSUM has served as the catalyst since its establishment in 2006 to promote change that propelled the state into the forefront of the global startup arena.KSUM is the Kerala government's nodal agency established in 2006 for entrepreneurship development and incubation activities in the state.Nageswaran said that with over 4,000 registered tech startups, 63 incubators and 10 lakh square feet of incubation space, KSUM has not only met its goal of promoting technology-based entrepreneurship but has also earned the distinguished position of being among the world's top business incubators.The November 16-18 fifth edition of Huddle Global, India's biggest beachside startup conclave, was organised by KSUM at Adimalathura beach, near Vizhinjam, here.Attended by around 1,500 delegates, the event displayed sophisticated products from emerging sectors such as robotics, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, life sciences, space tech, blockchain, IoT, e-governance, fintech, healthtech, agritech, edutech and SaaS from across the country.","Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran said tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country.

E-Commerce startup Udaan to trim costs ahead of 2025 IPO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/e-commerce-startup-udaan-to-trim-costs-ahead-of-2025-ipo/articleshow/105001132.cms,"E-commerce startup Udaan is working to curb costs and forge new partnerships with consumer brands in India as it prepares to go public in 2025.Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta said in an interview. That’s set to happen around the same time as its initial public offering, he said.The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said. “Second, strategically we want to ensure that we are top of mind with shopkeepers, with big manufacturers, and we maintain our relative market share.”Lightspeed Venture Partners-backed Udaan is among startups trying to tap the rapid growth of India’s economy and consumer market, while meeting investor demands for profitability. Udaan, which at its peak employed thousands, joined fellow Indian startups in slashing jobs last year and tightening internal controls and compliance. It now has about 1,800 staff, and Gupta didn’t specify if further job cuts are needed.Corporate governance lapses at Indian online tutoring firm Byju’s, once the country’s top startup with a valuation of $22 billion, shone a light at unique challenges faced by founders in the South Asian nation and drove companies to be more diligent.“We continue to move towards more professionalized management, professionalized board and also institutionalized shareholders as we go towards public markets,” Gupta said.Udaan is yet to decide whether it will list in India or overseas. It was valued at more than $3 billion in a 2021 funding round, and was in talks to raise $400 million, Business Standard reported in September. Lightspeed owns about 35% of Udaan, while Tencent Holdings Ltd. holds 6%.The company was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran Udaan until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021. The other two founders — Amod Malviya and Sujeet Kumar — are board members.Udaan built an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business still accounts for a very small part of India’s overall retail market but can balloon to $150 billion in sales and yield a 100% return on capital invested in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co. estimates published in the Mint newspaper.Bengaluru-based Udaan has also ventured into financing through its fintech unit which helps shopkeepers get working capital loans to buy inventory. That business is profitable before taxes and is growing 70% annually, Gupta said.“That’s a second business in the overall umbrella of Udaan trying to organize trade in the country,” Gupta said. “In addition to commerce, financing becomes an important market opportunity.”","Udaan will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta says.

How India's GDP has been growing

What SBI report said on savings and investment

Incremental capital output ratio

NEW DELHI: India's gross domestic product (GDP) data for the third quarter (October-December 2022) received a word of caution from the former Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Raghuram Rajan In an interview with news agency PTI, Rajan that India is ""dangerously close"" to the Hindu rate of growth in view of subdued private sector investment, high interest rates and slowing global growth.India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%.Rajan termed this sequential slowdown in growth as ""worrying"".However, a report released by the State Bank of India (SBI) economists on Tuesday dismissed arguments that India is dangerously close to Hindu rate of growth saying such statements are ""ill-conceived, biased and premature"".The term 'Hindu growth rate' was coined by late economist Raj Krishna in 1978 to describe the slow growth in the country.It basically refers to the low pace of economic growth rates during 1950s to 1980s. During this period, the Indian economy averaged 3.5%.A former lecturer at the Delhi School of Economics (DSE), Krishna noted that only if the rate of growth is persistently slow and accompanied by low per-capita GDP, then it will be known as Hindu rate of growth but it has to factor in population growth as well.Before economic reforms of 1991, India's economic growth remained stagnant and low, while per capita income averaged around 1.3%.Krishna termed this low growth situation to be a result of socialist policies of state control and import substitution.However, the economic situation changed when liberalisation, privatisation and globalisation (LPG) reforms came into effect in the year 1991, at a time when India faced balance of payment crisis.Over the years, many economists have strongly opposed the idea of 'Hindu growth rate' and the term never had universal acceptance.The Indian economy plunged into its very first technical recession in FY21 due to the impact of Covid-19 pandemic and the related nationwide lockdowns. GDP shrunk by an unprecedented 23.8% in the first quarter of the financial year 2020-21. However, due to spurt in economic activities in the subsequent quarters, the GDP decline started to narrow.However, if we look at the period before Covid-19 as well, India's growth curve shows a declining trend.From 8.26% in FY17, GDP growth plunged to 3.74% in FY20. Shutdown of economic activities in FY21 in wake of Covid-19 only made matters worse.As lockdowns started to ease and business activities resumed, India's GDP also started rising. In Q1 of FY22, growth jumped to 20.1% mainly on account of low base effect. By the fourth quarter of FY22, growth came down to 4.10%.Similarly, the new financial year 2022-23 brought fresh economic challenges in the form of Russia-Ukraine war that impacted almost all major economies of the world, slowed the pace of growth, pushed inflation to record highs.As a result, the central banks of all advanced economies spurred into action and opted for monetary policy tightening to curb the soaring inflation.With persistently rising interest rates, India's economy grew by 4.4% in Q3 of FY23, as the Centre revised upwards GDP growth for previous year to 9.10% from 8.7% earlier.The report weighed recent GDP numbers against the available data on savings and investments for the past decade and highlighted some interesting points.""Quarterly growth numbers are noisy and should be best avoided for any serious interpretation (on an average, India's GDP growth has witnessed Rs 2 lakh crore upward revision for the 3 year ended FY23),"" the report said.Gross capital formation (GCF) by the government touched a high of 11.8% in 2021-22, up from 10.7% in 2020-21.""This also had a domino effect on private sector investment that jumped from 10 per cent to 10.8% over the same period,"" it said.In fact, Ecowrap added that the trends in GCF to gross output ratio or the plough back of funds for creation of fresh capacity shows that for public administration the ratio attained fresh peak in 2021-22 owing to the emphasis on capital expenditure in recent budgets.At the aggregate level, gross capital formation is supposed to have crossed 32% in 2022-23, the highest level since 2018-19.According to the report, in 2021-22, gross savings have risen to 30% from 29% in 2020-21.""The ratio is supposed to have crossed 31 per cent in 2022-23, the highest since 2018-19. The household savings increased sharply during the pandemic period on account of sharp accretion in financial savings such as deposits,"" said the report by SBI's Economic Research Department.While household financial savings have since then moderated from 15.4% in 2020-21 to 11.1% in 2022-23, savings in physical assets have grown sharply to 11.8% in 2021-22 from 10.7% in 2020-21.The report further analysed Incremental Capital Output ratio (ICOR) -- which measures additional units of capital (investment) needed to produce additional units of output. It said that the ratio has been improving.""ICOR which was 7.5 in FY 12 is now only 3.5 in FY22. Clearly, only half of capital is now needed for next unit of output,"" the report noted.Such reducing ICOR in the current years reflects a relatively increasing efficiency of capital and shows that the economy is on a sound footing, the report said.""From that point of view, future GDP growth rates even at 7% could still mean a decent number by any standards!,"" it added.","India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%.

An employee is entitled for a 50 per cent amount of the last drawn salary as pension.OPS was discontinued by the NDA government in 2003 with effect from April 1, 2004.Under the new pension scheme (NPS), employees contribute 10 per cent of their basic salary towards pension while the government contributes 14 per cent.Governments of Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand have informed the central government/ Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA about their decision to restart OPS for their employees.The government of Punjab on November 18, 2022, issued a notification regarding implementation of OPS for the state government employees who are being covered under NPS. Jharkhand too has decided to revert to OPS.",Former RBI governor Raghuram Rajan has expressed his concern over the decision of some states to restart the old pension scheme.

'Hegemony Unacceptable, Will Resist': Ramapshosa Denounces Trump Trade Onslaught, Tariff Blackmail

The United States and Taiwan deepened their commercial relations on Thursday, signing a trade deal. Under the agreement, Taiwanese imports to the US will be getting lower tariffs while the island nation has committed to purchase and invest in American products.The step confirms a framework first presented in January. Under that plan, duties applied by Washington on numerous Taiwanese exports are being reduced from 20% to 15%, alongside efforts to bring in more Taiwanese capital into the US technology industry.Before it can take effect, the pact must pass review in Taiwan’s parliament, which is controlled by the opposition. US trade representative Jamieson Greer said the deal ""will eliminate tariff and non-tariff barriers facing US exports to Taiwan.""""This agreement also builds on our longstanding economic and trade relationship with Taiwan and will significantly enhance the resilience of our supply chains, particularly in high-technology sectors,"" he added in a statement.Taiwanese vice premier Cheng Li-chiun said that the outcome improves the island’s competitive position, placing it on a ""fair footing to compete with our rivals.""""Compared with our competitor countries, we have even gained a relative advantage, because the gap created by FTAs that previously left us behind has effectively been closed this time,"" Cheng told a press conference in Washington, referring to free trade agreements.He said Taipei had obtained ""Most Favored Nation"" treatment and achieved a reduction in the average charge ""on our exports to the US from an initial 15 percent, without stacking reciprocal tariffs, further down to an average of 12.33 percent.""A fact sheet from the US Trade Representative’s office sets out Taiwan’s intention to drive a ""long-term increase in its purchases of important US goods"" through 2029.Those purchases are expected to cover $44.4 billion in liquefied natural gas and crude oil, $15.2 billion in civil aircraft and engines, and another $25.2 billion spanning power equipment, electricity grids and other items.The document also notes that the United States agreed to ease its tariff levels on Taiwanese products after Taipei committed to taking ""significant steps to advance a stronger and more reciprocal trade relationship.""In addition, Taiwan has undertaken to cut most of its own tariff barriers and open the way for preferential access for American industrial and agricultural exports.","The United States and Taiwan deepened their commercial relations on Thursday, signing a trade deal.

Budget 2026 Overview: What Citizens And Businesses Should Know

(Radhika Saigal is FS Consulting Leader and Manoj Marwah is FS GCC Consulting Leader at EY India)

Union Budget 2026 propels India towards building a stable, scalable and globally competitive financial ecosystem that encourages global financial institutions to evaluate India not only as a growth market but also as a strategic base for delivery, innovation and risk-managed expansion.A key driver of investor confidence is the simplification and predictability through targeted tax provisions and reforms that reduces administrative overhead. One of the most consequential announcements in this context is the sharpening of India’s transfer pricing and tax certainty framework for technology and service-led operations—directly relevant for global companies running Global Capability Centers (GCCs) in India.The Budget proposes a significantly expanded Safe Harbour regime for IT services, with a uniform safe harbour margin of 15.5% and an enhanced threshold that rises from ₹300 crore to ₹2,000 crore. Earlier differences between KPO, BPO, and other services often led to classification issues, especially for diversified and larger GCCs. A single margin better reflects how modern GCCs operate today, with integrated technology, analytics, and business functions.This also brings a much larger share of mid-sized and large GCCs within the Safe Harbour framework, while also reducing uncertainty for smaller centres that are scaling. At this scale, the threshold covers GCCs with headcounts of up to ~6,000-8,000, bringing around 80% of financial services (FS) GCCs within the framework – with the remaining 20 % covered by the Advance Pricing Agreements (APA) for whom also the timeline has been reduced to two years.These APAs help companies agree in advance on how their cross-border transactions (GCC & HQ) will be taxed, reducing the risk of future disputes. Earlier, this process could take several years, creating uncertainty for global firms operating GCCs in India. The faster timeline provides quicker tax clarity, making it easier for companies to plan investments, expand teams, and move higher-value work to India with greater confidence.By easing a long-standing compliance and transfer pricing burden, the change allows GCCs across sizes to plan expansion with greater confidence. It also proposes consolidating multiple service segments (including IT services, IT-enabled services and knowledge process outsourcing, and contract R&D) under a single category. For GCC-heavy global firms—many of whom support core banking platforms, digital channels, analytics, cybersecurity, operations and finance processes from India—this is a material development. It provides a predictable operating model for multi-year planning.Beyond taxation, the Budget introduces targeted fiscal incentives and skilling grants for Tier-2 cities such as Kochi, Indore, and Coimbatore. These measures aim to ease the pressure on metro cities while enabling GCCs to access new talent pools. This supports balanced regional growth as currently FS GCCs have scanty presence in non-metros.For global FS firms, the strategic impact is larger than transfer pricing alone. This framework supports a shift from India being viewed merely as a cost-efficient offshore center to being recognised as a stable, long-term delivery hub where scale can be pursued with fewer structural uncertainties. In practical terms, it enables leadership teams to make bolder commitments on headcount growth, product engineering expansion, and investments in data platforms and AI delivery from India, without the same degree of annual pricing and audit volatility. The option to continue safe harbour treatment for multiple years further strengthens the case for long-horizon operating models and long-term investments.Budget 2026 also strengthens India’s attractiveness through its broader posture on foreign investment and cross-border financial integration. Global firms tend to favour jurisdictions that combine growth with operational stability, and where the policy environment supports both local business development and global connectivity. This benefits international banks, insurers, asset managers and fintechs in evaluating India as a key node in their global growth strategy.A further tailwind for global FS investment and GCC scaling in India could come from the reported reduction of US tariffs to ~18%, which may improve the overall outlook for cross-border trade flows and global supply chains. When combined with Budget 2026’s safe harbour framework that enhances transfer pricing certainty for IT services, this creates a reinforcing cycle: higher global business activity drives greater FS servicing needs, while India’s improved regulatory and tax predictability strengthens the case for locating long-term capability build and critical delivery functions in India.",Budget 2026 also strengthens India’s attractiveness through its broader posture on foreign investment and cross-border financial integration. A key driver of investor confidence is the simplification and predictability through targeted tax provisions and reforms that reduces administrative overhead.

IT stocks continued to trade in red on Friday. The sector extended its fall as investor sentiments were dragged down by fears of disruption from artificial intelligence and fading expectations of an early interest rate cut by the US Federal Reserve.At 9:50 am, the Nifty IT index slumped 4.59%, or 1,520 points, to trade at 31,639, reflecting broad-based weakness across technology counters. Infosys fell 85 points, or 6.13%, to 1,299 on the NSE, while TCS declined 4.77% to 2,619. HCLTech and Wipro dropped 4.48% and 3.64%, respectively, and Tech Mahindra was lower by 2.66%. In the mid-tier space, Coforge tumbled 1,345 points, or 5.32%, Persistent lost 3.16% to 5,279, and LTIMindtree slipped 3.62% to 5,023.This comes just a day after the 10 stock pack Nifty IT index emerged as the worst performing segment on Thursday, plunging close to its lowest level in almost 10 months and continuing to be the weakest sector for this year, so far.In US, American Depository Receipts of Infosys and Wipro retreated sharply, extending losses for a second straight session. Infosys ended down as much as 10% at $14.21 on the New York Stock Exchange, while Wipro shed 5% to finish at $2.28.The weakness follows a brutal outing in the previous trade when the Nifty IT index dived up to 5.5% and several heavyweights cracked as much as 6%, according to ET.Traders expect the pressure to radiate across the wider technology universe, keeping stocks such as Coforge, Persistent Systems, LTIMindtree and HCLTech firmly in focus.The immediate trigger for the latest bout of anxiety has been a new offering from Anthropic, the firm known for the Claude chatbot. Investors see the move as another reminder that AI adoption could intensify rivalry, squeeze profitability and chip away at the competitive strengths traditionally enjoyed by IT services companies, according to ET. Sentiment towards software exporters had already been fragile, and the announcement deepened the caution.According to VK Vijayakumar from Geojit Investments, ""Tech stocks, reeling under the Anthropic shock, are unlikely to recover soon."" According to some market watchers, as much as 40% of revenue could be at risk if automated systems take over work once handled by human employees.Brokerage house Motilal Oswal also flagged risks, arguing that AI may render traditional software development and testing assignments less critical. However, it recommended keeping an eye on potential tie-ups in the coming three to six months that could pave the way for fresh AI-led deals by mid-2026.","At 9:50 am, the Nifty IT index slumped 4.59%, or 1,520 points, to trade at 31,639.

Indian benchmark indices traded within a narrow range during the week, exhibiting a positive bias amid supportive domestic cues. Market sentiment remained constructive, underpinned by a revival in Foreign Institutional Investor (FII) inflows. After a phase of sustained outflows, FIIs have turned net buyers, reflecting renewed confidence in India’s macroeconomic fundamentals. The continuation of these inflows is expected to lend further support to equities, particularly in light of improving GDP growth expectations.Investor attention has gradually shifted toward the concluding phase of the third-quarter earnings season. Market participants are closely evaluating corporate earnings performance and forward-looking management commentary to gauge the sustainability of earnings growth. Additionally, upcoming inflation data will be a key monitorable in both India and US, as it may influence expectations regarding the Reserve Bank of India’s and US FOMC future rate decision.Developments related to the proposed trade agreement also remain in focus, with reports suggesting that the final contours are nearing completion. Greater clarity on this front could provide incremental direction to the markets in the near term.Overall, the market undertone remains cautiously optimistic, supported by improving macroeconomic indicators and stabilizing external flows.Nifty post the RBI monetary policy outcome rebounded from the support area of 20 days EMA and tested the immediate resistance area of 26,000 in Wednesday session.Going forward, index sustaining above the key psychological level of 26,000, will open upwards toward the key resistance area of 26,200–26,300 in the coming sessions. However, if it fails to move above the 26,000 levels, the index is likely to consolidate in the range of 25,500-26,000.The overall outlook remains positive, and market dips should be seen as buying opportunities. Immediate support is placed at 25,500–25,400, which aligns with last week’s breakout area and the 20-day EMA.Volatility is likely to remain elevated amid uncertain global cues and the rising crude oil prices.BANKNIFTYBank Nifty traded in a range with positive bias during the current week. PSU banking stocks extended their outperformance.Going ahead, a move above 61,000 levels will lead to further upside toward the 61,400 and 61,800 levels in the coming sessions. Failure to move above 61,000 will signal some consolidation in the range of 59,800-60,800 levelsBias remains positive and we believe dips should be used as buying opportunity, with short term support seen at 59500-59200 levels being the confluence of the 20- and 50-days EMA. Volatility is likely to remain elevated amid uncertain global cuesThe stock is at the cusp of generating a breakout above a falling supply line joining the highs of October 2025 and January 2026 signaling resumption of up move and offers fresh entry opportunity.We expect the stock to head towards 413 levels in the coming quarters being the high of October 2025 and the upper band of the last 12 months range.Daily 14 periods RSI is in uptrend and is seen sustaining above its nine periods average thus supports the positive bias in the stock.Buying demand is seen emerging from the 52 weeks EMA and the previous major low of October 2025 signaling strength and offers fresh entry opportunity.The stock during last week formed a bullish engulfing candle signaling strength and opening upside towards 332 levels being the 123.6% external retracement of the previous decline.The daily 14 periods RSI is seen rebounding, taking support at its nine periods average thus supports the positive bias in the stock.

NEW DELHI: In a rapidly reshaping global economy, strategic sovereignty has emerged as a guiding imperative, as nations navigate global supply chains while safeguarding critical capabilities in an increasingly fragmented world, global business leaders said.During a panel discussion, KPMG India CEO Yezdi Nagporewalla, global leaders across new age economy, technology and defence, financial inclusion, and consumer sectors, discussed the challenges and opportunities of operating in a fragmented global economy.Highlighting the core of strategic sovereignty in a world of global supply chains, General Atomics Global Corporation CEO Vivek Lall, chief executive of, said, “It is about reducing vulnerability to geopolitical choke points, whether in energy, technology, manufacturing, logistics, or data. Strengthening domestic capabilities while building trusted international partnerships is critical, and it is equally important to develop resilience against any potential choke points. As the global community moves forward, the underlying theme is going to be human resource training and human resource knowledge, capabilities. This is often underemphasized, but at the root of strategic sovereignty is a strong focus on human resource development.”Talking about how strategic sovereignty is reshaping the flow of global capital, Kishore Moorjani CEO - Alternatives, Private Funds CapitaLand Investment said, “Perhaps there’s no better place to see that in action than in India. When the country began liberalising over 30 years ago, it was hungry for capital and attracted significant foreign institutional investment. While FII capital is important, it can be fickle. Today, the situation has reversed: capital is chasing India… We respect the sovereignty of the markets we operate in and align our investments accordingly. We come to build India, not just trade.”Discussing the role of financial institutions in building national resilience, Mary Ellen Iskenderian, president & CEO of Women’s World Banking, said, “True economic resilience depends on inclusive access to savings, credit, insurance, and digital payments. Financial inclusion strengthens households and communities, particularly in the face of climate shocks and economic volatility, reinforcing national stability from the ground up. ”On the question of how consumer brands maintain core identity while navigating local cultures, regulations, and consumer expectations, Mike Jatania, CEO and chairman The Body Shop & co-founder of Aurea, said: “For brands operating across borders, maintaining identity while respecting national priorities is essential. If your brand has a clear purpose and core values, it can adapt locally without losing its identity.

"Toilets, garbage, linen: Railways overhauls of on-board services, in Gen Coaches as well",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/toilets-garbage-linen-railways-overhauls-of-on-board-services-in-gen-coaches-as-well/articleshow/128357172.cms,".

NEW DELHI: Railways is seeking to address the biggest concern of long distance passengers— train toilets. It on Saturday rolled out reforms in on-board services with focus on regular cleaning of toilets, wash basins and garbage collection in trains on the move, including for millions of passenger travelling in general or unreserved coaches to have access to cleaned toilets.This is a sharp contrast to the current practice where toilets, basins and common areas in general coaches of moving trains are not cleaned at regular intervals unless there is a complaint. A top railway official said this provision is being introduced for the first time. Railway minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said, “In the current mechanism, cleaning is done only in reserved coaches. We have included general coaches in the new reform. ” Officials said they aim to ensure cleaning of toilets in such coaches every 1-2 hours.Vaishnaw also said the earlier “clean train station” concept, which provided thorough cleaning at limited stations, is now being replaced with a continuous cleaning model from the train’s origin to its destination. “Toilets, garbage bins, cabin interiors, water availability, and minor electrical or mechanical defects such as lights going out will be addressed continuously during the journey,” he said.Minister announced two reforms — ‘for better on-board services’ and ‘rail-based logistics through Gati Shakti cargo terminals and cargo related facilities’ — as a part of its target to implement “52 Reforms in 52 Weeks in 2026”.To begin with, around 80 long-distance trains with high passenger patronage — 4-5 trains per zone — will be covered under reforms relating to on-board services in the next six months and over three years, it will be implemented across all trains. Vaishnaw said fully technology-enabled professional teams will be engaged with defined Service Level Agreements, specifying cleaning frequency and more frequent cleaning during peak hours. Continuous toilet cleaning, garbage removal, cabinetry cleaning, linen handling and related services will be ensured, and AI-generated images of cleaning activities will be monitored and analysed.Vaishnaw said the linen distribution, linen collection, and cleaning functions, which were earlier distributed among separate agencies, will also now be integrated and awarded to a single entity.He said the reforms in the cargo terminal segment are expected to generate around Rs 30,000 crore additional revenue from new Gati Shakti Cargo Terminals (GCTs) in the next three years. The most significant additions are the integration of processing within cargo terminals, transforming them into “cargo plus processing” hubs and extending contract period from the current 35 years to 50 years.","Railways rolls out reforms in on-board services with focus on regular cleaning of toilets, wash basins and garbage collection in trains on the move.

S&P Global chief: India’s post-Covid expansion among most consistent for any major economy,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/sp-global-chief-indias-post-covid-expansion-among-most-consistent-for-any-major-economy/articleshow/128364157.cms,"NEW DELHI: Driven by structural reforms, entrepreneurial energy and a forward-looking approach to debt and development, India’s post-Covid expansion has been among the most consistent for any major economy, with expectations remaining strong for the medium term, Yann Le Pallec, president, S&P Global Ratings said on Saturday.“In our latest report, we explored how India is navigating a new global reality and what we found was a story of resilience, but also one of ambition which is at the core of Viksit Bharat 2047,” Le Pallec said, while highlighting India’s sustained commitment to fiscal discipline, targeted public investments and credible policy frameworks that have enhanced confidence in the country`s long term growth trajectory.Pointing to the link between trust, transparency, confidence and capital flows in a rapidly changing world economy, he said that few economies understand better than India that the “price of trust is truly the price of growth” and when trust breaks down, the cost of capital becomes a tax on progress.Referring to the growing depth of India’s domestic bond market and rising foreign participation, Le Pallec said inclusion of Indian govt bonds in global indices can significantly increase overseas investment and expand funding opportunities for domestic companies over coming years.Such developments, he said, strengthen the country’s financial ecosystem and support long-term growth.“This evolving distribution of trust aligns with the broader structural shift in the global economy. The centre of the global economy continues to move east. Emerging markets are expected to represent two-thirds of global growth this year, a trend which is supported by domestic policy predictability at a time when global uncertainty is rising,” he said.Le Pallec stressed that trust has always been at the heart of financial systems as credit ratings were created to help investors assess risk in emerging industries. Over time, standardised ratings became an important benchmark for global investors, enabling informed decisions and greater transparency during periods of uncertainty, including major economic downturns.According to Le Pallec, the role of credit ratings has remained largely unchanged in principle, providing independent assessments of risk, but the environment around them has transformed dramatically as global markets today face rising geopolitical uncertainties, shifting trade rules and changing policy dynamics, all of which influence the way trust is formed and maintained.He said that the global order built on predictable trade and policy frameworks is undergoing structural change. As trust weakens in certain relationships, countries and investors are increasingly focusing on diversification. This includes reducing exposure to concentrated risks, seeking new partnerships and strengthening domestic financial systems. While these adjustments may increase costs in the short term, he suggested they can also provide long-term resilience.","Yann Le Pallec, president, S&P Global Ratings said India's post-Covid expansion has been among the most consistent for any major economy.

India’s AI Rise Gets Global Push As UN Chief Praises Leadership, Nvidia CEO Predicts Job Surge

Survey across 650 IT firms

Productivity boost, not job wipeout

Policymakers reassured, but no room for complacency

A new study by the Indian Council for Research on International Economic Relations (ICRIER), supported by OpenAI, has sought to ease concerns about large-scale job losses due to artificial intelligence.According to the report, generative AI is not triggering mass layoffs in India’s IT sector at present. Instead, it is reshaping how work is organised, improving productivity and transforming job roles.The findings are based on a survey of 650 IT firms across 10 Indian cities, conducted between November 2025 and January 2026. The study examined hiring trends, changes in occupational demand, productivity outcomes and workforce skilling patterns.Titled ‘AI and Jobs: This Time is No Different’, the study concluded that AI is amplifying output and strengthening the role of skilled professionals rather than replacing them.Firms reported a modest slowdown in hiring, mainly at the entry level, while recruitment at mid and senior levels has remained stable.Researchers noted that this moderation is in line with broader post-pandemic trends in the IT sector and cannot be attributed solely to AI adoption.The study found that roles widely seen as vulnerable to automation, such as software developers and database administrators, are in fact among those seeing the strongest growth in demand.It said generative AI is acting as a productivity-enhancing tool that complements technical and analytical work, rather than serving as a substitute.Ronnie Chatterji, chief economist at OpenAI, was quoted by news agency PTI as saying, “We are seeing a shift in how work is organised, where AI appears to be complementing human talent. This data offers a window into the transition underway in India”.He added that the focus should now shift to helping workers adapt. “Focus now should be on the practical steps needed to help workers align their skills with the advancing capabilities of AI. Currently, only 4 per cent of firms have trained more than half their workforce in AI, presenting a huge opportunity for growth.”Shekhar Aiyar, director and chief executive of ICRIER, said the debate around AI and jobs often involves strong opinions, but the study brings concrete evidence to the discussion.“Everyone has opinions on this matter,” he said, adding that the ICRIER-OpenAI research “brings evidence to the table”.He noted that the authors combined survey data with in-depth interviews of leaders in the Indian IT industry to assess the real impact of generative AI.“The results should reassure Indian policymakers without inducing complacency,” Aiyar said, cautioning that while the IT sector appears to be handling AI adoption reasonably well, many firms are still not fully prepared for future shifts.","A new study has sought to ease concerns about large-scale job losses due to artificial intelligence.

Gold continues to hold strong appeal among young Indians, even as access to modern financial products widens, with 62 per cent of respondents naming the precious metal as their preferred investment option, according to a survey.The findings suggest that despite the rise of mutual funds, equities and crypto assets, gold remains the go-to choice for Gen Z and Millennials when it comes to parking their money.The Smytten PulseAI survey, conducted among 5,000 consumers aged between 18 and 39, found that 61.9 per cent would choose gold if they had Rs 25,000 to invest today, as per news agency PTI.This was significantly higher than other options. Mutual funds were chosen by 16.6 per cent of respondents, fixed deposits by 13 per cent, stocks by 6.6 per cent and crypto by just 1.9 per cent.During periods of economic uncertainty, gold’s appeal appeared even stronger. Around 65.7 per cent of those surveyed said gold feels like the safest option compared to bank savings, mutual funds or equities.The findings underline gold’s continued role as a financial safety net across both Gen Z and Millennials.The survey also highlighted a shift in how young people are approaching gold purchases. About 66.7 per cent of respondents said buying gold is largely a personal decision rather than one driven by family tradition.At the same time, buying patterns are changing. Nearly 62 per cent said their most recent gold purchase was below 5 grams. Breaking this down further, 27.5 per cent bought less than 2 grams, while 34.4 per cent purchased between 2 and 5 grams.Overall, 61.9 per cent of recent purchases were under 5 grams, indicating a move away from large, occasional buys towards smaller and more frequent investments.Traditionally associated with weddings and family events, gold is now increasingly being bought for personal financial reasons.According to the survey, nearly 24 per cent said their first gold purchase was triggered by receiving their first salary or earning personal income.Another 23.9 per cent cited an investment decision as the reason for their first purchase.The survey suggests that while gold retains its cultural importance, younger investors are approaching it with a more practical and individual mindset, integrating tradition with financial planning.","61.9 per cent of respondents would choose gold if they had Rs 25,000 to invest today.

'India Now Central To Global Growth', Says FM Nirmala Sitharaman As Elon Musk Flags Power Shift

Spending more, not waiting for aid

Focus on adaptation and fairness

Renewable push and carbon capture funding

India has sharply increased its spending on climate action over the past six years, with allocations rising from around 3.7 per cent of GDP to nearly 5.6 per cent, Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman said on Saturday.Speaking at the ‘Degrees of Instability: Climate Security in a Warming World’ townhall during the Munich Security Conference in Germany, she said the country was taking strong domestic steps to meet its environmental commitments rather than depending solely on international support.Highlighting the jump in allocations, Sitharaman said, “India has increased its commitment to climate action. We were at something like 3.7 per cent of our GDP six years ago... but today, we are somewhere close to 5.6 per cent. So more than doubled in a matter of six years”.She underlined that India had already put money on the table. “We have invested the funds. We are not waiting for financing and technology to come from elsewhere but they must come,” she said, as quoted by news agency PTI.While acknowledging that global technology transfers and financial flows remain important, she stressed that India has moved ahead with its own resources to achieve its nationally determined commitments (NDCs).She also pointed out that many African nations may find it difficult to match such levels of spending due to economic constraints.The finance minister argued that climate policy must go beyond emission cuts. Equal weight, she said, should be given to resilience and adaptation to avoid severe consequences for people and livestock.“As much attention we give for the emission control, we need to look at resilience and adaptation. Otherwise, you're going to sacrifice a lot,” she said.She added that “technologies will have to talk to each other” and cautioned that no country can claim to have found a perfect solution to climate change.Sitharaman also pressed for what she described as differentiated treatment in sharing the financial burden of climate action. According to news agency ANI, she said the global community must follow a “polluter pays” principle.“It cannot be that countries which have less contributed to emission are made to pay equally,” she said, adding that countries with lower historical emissions should contribute less towards climate costs.Detailing India’s domestic progress, Sitharaman said the country has already achieved two-thirds of its renewable energy commitments under its NDCs and that too four years ahead of schedule.She added that the Union Budget 2026-27 has earmarked funds and incentives for carbon capture strategies. These technologies are being encouraged across the mainland and in remote regions to help businesses cut their carbon footprint and support India’s transition to a greener economy, reported ANI.Reiterating India’s position, the minister said the country would continue to invest steadily in renewable energy while pushing for fair and practical global cooperation on climate finance and technology.","India has sharply increased its spending on climate action over the past six years, with allocations rising from around 3.7 per cent of GDP to nearly 5.6 per cent.

A quieter federal shift

NEW DELHI: For decades, India’s fiscal federal system has had one core element that stood out: poorer states would be supported so that growth could be shared.The 16th Finance Commission has not broken that promise on paper. States will still receive 41 percent of the divisible pool of central taxes. But beneath that headline number, the logic of how money moves across the Union is beginning to change.For the first time, economic output shapes transfers. Long-running revenue deficit grants — once a fiscal buffer for states — have been eliminated. Parts of local government funding are now tied to performance benchmarks. Disaster funding is moving towards risk-indexed allocation rather than discretionary relief.The shift is subtle in design but important in consequence. Transfers are no longer only about closing gaps. They are increasingly about shaping behaviour — rewarding growth, nudging fiscal discipline, and linking public money to administrative capacity.“Considering India’s growth imperative, there is a need for at least a small shift in the devolution criteria towards efficiency,” the Commission said, capturing the direction of travel.Under Article 280 of the Constitution, a Finance Commission is appointed roughly every five years to recommend how Union tax revenues are shared with states and how that share is distributed among them.The 16th Commission covers the period from 2026-27 to 2030-31. Its recommendations come at a time when India is expected to remain one of the fastest-growing major economies and set to become world’s third largest economy in the recommendation period.The core decisions are twofold. Vertical devolution determines what share of central taxes goes to states. Horizontal devolution determines how that pool is divided among them. The vertical share remained unchanged. The horizontal framework has changed.For the first time, contribution to national GDP has been included as a horizontal devolution criterion with a 10 percent weight.Karnataka gains 0.48 percentage points. Kerala gains 0.45 percentage point. Madhya Pradesh loses 0.50 percentage point. Bihar loses 0.11 percentage points .The formula now combines income distance, population, demographic performance, area, forest, GDP contribution. Income distance continues to drive equalisation. GDP contribution introduces an efficiency signal.In response to TOI queries, DK Srivastava, Chief Policy Advisor at EY India, questioned the conceptual basis.“Linking devolution to production efficiency does not appear to be justified,” he said.He said variation in state GDP contribution reflects structural economic factors rather than fiscal management.“It is important to distinguish between efficiency of a production system and efficiency of a fiscal system. GSDPs and GDP are the outcome of the production system in a country which is largely driven by market forces. Inter-state variation in the contribution of the GSDP of an individual state to the overall GDP depends largely on the inter-state concentration of capital stock, inter-state movement of financial and human resources and state level availability of infrastructure,” Srivastava said.He said fiscal rules themselves reinforce divergence.“The differences in inter-state infrastructure depends largely on the limit of fiscal deficit of 3% of GSDP which is by definition higher for higher GSDP states,” he said. “Lowering of the weight attached to the income distance criterion and giving a relatively high weight to the contribution criterion would reduce the degree of equalization.”Ranen Banerjee, Partner and Leader, Economic Advisory, PwC India, said the change sends a policy signal rather than creating an immediate redistribution shock.“The introduction of contribution to GDP as a parameter is a bold step as it clearly puts growth and consequent improvement in the per capita incomes of citizens as an important imperative,” he told TOI.He said states are already competing on growth and investment metrics.“The states have been competing in attracting investments and improving their ease of doing business as well as articulating ambitious growth targets,” Banerjee said. “The signalling through this indicator could possibly work towards restraining populist expenditures and encouraging capital output enhancing expenditures that lead to economic growth.”He added the numerical impact remains modest.“While this may not be counted as a structural shift given the highest negative impact of just 50 basis points in the share of a state with all the changes in the weights and introduction of this parameter, it is a big incentive for states to perform well and provide growth to its population,” he said.Rumki Majumdar, Economist at Deloitte India, said the shift formally introduces performance into federal fiscal thinking.“The introduction of GDP contribution marks an important evolution: for the first time, economic performance finds measured recognition in horizontal devolution,” she said.The Commission has eliminated revenue deficit grants entirely, ending a mechanism historically used to support fiscally weaker states.The Commission’s reasoning is behavioural. It argues that persistent revenue support created ‘adverse incentive structures’ and weakened fiscal reform pressure.Srivastava said stronger design could still have been built around subsidy discipline.“One possible approach could have been to more explicitly exclude excessive or unjustified subsidies in the assessment of states’ expenditure needs during the award period,” he said. “Designing calibrated fiscal incentives or disincentives linked to subsidy discipline may enhance accountability.”Local bodies will receive Rs 7.91 lakh crore between 2026 and 2031, with 60 percent going to rural bodies and 40 percent to urban bodies.Within this, 80 percent is basic grants and 20 percent is performance-linked.Performance conditions include audited accounts publication, property tax system strengthening, and own revenue growth targets.Majumdar said transparency reform is foundational.“Uniform on-budget reporting becomes the first step toward discipline,” she said.She said transparency alone is insufficient without incentive design.“A shift to uniform, on-budget accounting will ensure states remain committed to the path of fiscal prudence. That said, transparency will have to paired with targeted incentives for efficiency and progressive designs,” she said.The Commission has expanded formula-based disaster allocations using a disaster risk index based on hazard, exposure and vulnerability.Banerjee said the framework attempts to balance predictability with flexibility.“The sixteenth finance commission's disaster relief and mitigation fund related recommendations have built in fiscal flexibility,” he said.He said extreme disaster funding scales with the size of the event.“The risk to extreme tail end disaster events that essentially entails relief has been adequately provided for with a graded contribution from states and centre based on the size of relief,” he said.He said fund stockpiling is controlled while allowing emergency replenishment.“The commission has also recommended capping of accumulation in the SDRF to the extent of past 3 years allocation,” he said.“In the event the fund gets depleted on account of a disaster, it has given provision for its replenishment,” he said.He said mitigation spending remains underused.“The challenge has been utilisation of the State Disaster Mitigation Funds,” he said.“Work on mitigation measures utilising the mitigation funds will be the best way to bring down the risks to be within modelled risk scenarios,” he said.Srivastava said tail-risk disasters remain a central government stabilisation responsibility.“Tail-risk disasters refer to high impact, low probability events such as natural disasters and pandemics,” he said.“In the macro-fiscal stabilization framework, dealing with these disasters is largely the responsibility of the central government,” he said.He said fiscal rule flexibility may be necessary in extreme events.“This calls for some flexibility in the fiscal deficit to GDP targets provided in the Centre's FRBM Act,” he said.He cited pandemic precedent.“For events such as Covid-19 also, it was the central government that increased its fiscal deficit to an inordinately high level of 9.2% of GDP in 2020-21 to cope with the Covid led economic contraction,” he said.He said long-term catastrophic planning remains incomplete.“There is also a case to plan for dealing with disasters like pandemics, nuclear and biological holocausts in advance,” he said.Majumdar framed the shift as systemic resilience building.“When the next black swan arrives, the question is not whether models predicted it, but whether financing can move at the speed of need,” she said.“By modernising risk indices, widening eligibility and introducing market-based risk transfer, the framework somewhat ensures that public finances retain the agility required for a new era of tail-risk volatility,” she said.The Commission has recommended subsidy rationalisation, improved targeting, sunset clauses and stronger disclosure.Banerjee said fiscal deficit limits already create indirect discipline.“The fiscal federalism structure has an in-built mechanism that penalises fiscal profligacy by states,” he said.“This is through capping of the fiscal deficit that means limiting the borrowing that a state can undertake,” he said.He said adjustment pressures fall on capital spending.“When states are faced with serious fiscal constraints on account of excessive subsidy, the borrowing limit forces it to rationalise expenses,” he said.“Given the rigidity of expenditure for salaries, pension and interest payments, the casualty of such rationalisation is the capital expenditure,” he said.He said transparency can create market pressure.“More transparency on the fiscal condition of a state should upward pressure on the yields of the state development loans raised by the states making borrowing more expensive,” he said.Srivastava said stronger incentive architecture could have been considered.“One possible approach could have been to more explicitly exclude excessive or unjustified subsidies in the assessment of states’ expenditure needs,” he said.“Designing calibrated fiscal incentives or disincentives linked to subsidy discipline may enhance accountability,” he said.The Commission does not abandon equalisation. Income distance remains the dominant driver.But incentive-linked federalism now sits alongside support-based transfers.Growth versus redistribution, performance versus protection and fiscal discipline versus political economy pressures now operate within the same transfer structure.Over the next five years, states will adjust spending, borrowing and welfare design around this framework.","The 16th Finance Commission has not broken that promise on paper.

Reform-driven urban governance



The Union Cabinet has approved the launch of the Urban Challenge Fund (UCF) with a total Central Assistance of Rs 1 lakh crore, aimed at driving market-linked urban infrastructure development and catalysing investments worth around Rs 4 lakh crore over the next five years.The fund marks a shift in urban development model away from grant-based financing towards “market-linked, reform-driven and outcome-oriented infrastructure creation, according to government statement.The scheme will be operational from FY 2025–26 to FY 2030–31, with an extendable implementation window till FY 2033–34.Under the framework, Central Assistance will cover 25% of the project cost, while at least 50% of funding must be mobilised from market sources such as municipal bonds, bank loans and Public–Private Partnerships (PPPs). The remaining portion can be funded by states, Union Territories, urban local bodies or other sources.The fund is designed to leverage private investment, strengthen municipal finance systems and improve governance, while supporting citizen-centric urban reforms and high-quality infrastructure delivery.The PIB statement said the fund aims to create “resilient, productive, inclusive and climate-responsive cities”, positioning urban centres as key drivers of India’s next phase of economic growth.A dedicated Rs 5,000 crore corpus will be used to enhance the creditworthiness of 4,223 cities, including Tier-II and Tier-III urban centres, particularly those accessing market financing for the first time.The Cabinet has also approved a Credit Repayment Guarantee Scheme of Rs 5,000 crore to support urban local bodies in Northeastern and hilly states, and smaller cities with populations below one lakh.The scheme will provide a Central guarantee of up to Rs 7 crore or 70% of the loan amount, whichever is lower, for first-time loans. For subsequent loans, the guarantee will be up to Rs 7 crore or 50% of the loan amount.This is expected to support projects worth at least Rs 20 crore in smaller cities initially and Rs 28 crore in subsequent phases.Projects will be selected through a competitive challenge-based framework focusing on transformative impact, sustainability and reform orientation.Funding will be linked to reform milestones, defined outcomes and performance benchmarks. Continued fund release will depend on sustained reform progress, with monitoring to be carried out through a digital portal of the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs.Focus on growth hubs, city redevelopment and water infrastructureThe fund will support projects across three major verticals:Smaller cities, including those in Northeastern and hilly states, will be supported through the credit guarantee component, with the government indicating that “in principle all cities will be covered under UCF”.Funding will be linked to reforms across governance, financial systems, service delivery and urban planning, including digital governance, credit strengthening measures and transit-oriented development.Projects will be evaluated based on their ability to deliver economic, social and climate outcomes, including revenue generation, private investment mobilisation, job creation, improved safety, inclusiveness and service delivery.The government expects the Urban Challenge Fund to catalyse large-scale private investment, improve urban governance and accelerate the development of future-ready cities aligned with national development priorities.","The Union Cabinet has approved the launch of the Urban Challenge Fund (UCF) with a total Central Assistance of Rs 1 lakh crore.

Safety expenditure on Indian Railways has nearly tripled over the past decade to Rs 1,17,693 crore in 2025-26 from Rs 39,200 crore in 2013-14, with the national transporter expanding deployment of indigenous train protection system Kavach and rolling out CCTV surveillance across coaches and locomotives, the government said in response to questions in the Rajya Sabha.Safety remains the highest priority for Indian Railways and the stepped-up investments have contributed to a steep decline in accidents over the years, according to information shared in the Rajya Sabha by Railway Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw.Trackside implementation of Kavach -- an indigenously developed Automatic Train Protection (ATP) system -- has been taken up across 23,360 route kilometres, covering the Golden Quadrilateral, Golden Diagonal, High Density Network and other identified sections of the rail network.Kavach assists loco pilots in operating trains within specified speed limits and automatically applies brakes if the driver fails to do so. It also enables safer operations during adverse weather conditions. The system was adopted as the national ATP system in July 2020.After extensive trials, Kavach Version 4.0 has been commissioned across 1,297 route kilometres, including key high-density corridors such as Delhi–Mumbai and Delhi–Howrah.The latest version improves location accuracy, enhances signal information handling in large yards, and enables direct interface with electronic interlocking systems.Indian Railways has also finalised tenders to equip 6,300 electric locomotives with Kavach Version 4.0, while another tender for 2,679 diesel locomotives is under finalisation. More than 48,000 personnel, including about 45,000 loco pilots and assistant loco pilots, have been trained on Kavach technology so far.The cost of providing trackside and station Kavach infrastructure is about Rs 50 lakh per km, while onboard locomotive equipment costs about Rs 80 lakh per loco. Funds utilised on Kavach works till December 2025 stood at Rs 2,573.36 crore, with Rs 1,673.19 crore allocated for 2025-26.Alongside, Indian Railways is expanding onboard surveillance to enhance passenger safety. Around 12,300 coaches — including all operational Vande Bharat and Amrit Bharat train rakes — and 460 locomotives have been equipped with CCTV cameras across the network.The installation of CCTV cameras is aimed at deterring vandalism, theft and other miscreant activities while assisting in incident investigation, with zonal railways and production units undertaking procurement and installation.","Safety expenditure on Indian Railways has nearly tripled over the past decade to Rs 1,17,693 crore in 2025-26 from Rs 39,200 crore in 2013-14.

Consumers to buy and sell electricity! DERC greenlights peer-to-peer power trading pilot,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/consumers-to-buy-and-sell-electricity-derc-greenlights-peer-to-peer-power-trading-pilot/articleshow/128337717.cms,"Where and how the pilot will run

Who can participate?

How trading will work



Charges, fees and relaxations

Delhiites could soon change the way they use electricity! In a major move to reshape how power is bought and sold, the Delhi Electricity Regulatory Commission (DERC) has approved a framework allowing consumers to trade electricity directly with one another. The order clears the path for Tata Power Delhi Distribution Ltd and BSES Rajdhani Power Ltd to roll out a pilot project on peer-to-peer energy trading.At the heart of the initiative is the idea of turning consumers into active market participants. Prosumers or those who generate electricity through renewable sources such as rooftop solar, will be able to sell surplus energy to other users instead of routing it back to a distribution company at a fixed rate. Homes and commercial buildings with solar installations could, in effect, function as small power plants feeding into a digital marketplace.Officials indicated that the first phase is expected to begin this month in north and south Delhi, with around 1,000 consumers in each zone. “It will allow trading within the two discoms and also between Delhi and Uttar Pradesh as Purvanchal Vidyut Vitaran Nigam Limited is participating in the initiative,” an official said.A wider rollout is planned through three utilities, BSES Rajdhani Power Limited, Tata Power-Delhi Distribution Limited and Paschimanchal Vidyut Vitran Nigam Limited, enabling consumers in south, southwest, west, north and northwest Delhi, as well as parts of western Uttar Pradesh, to participate. Together, the three companies serve around 1.25 crore consumers, though the pilot will begin with a limited pool of roughly 1,000 users in each discom’s area. PVVNL managing director Raveesh Gupta told ET that consumers from varied backgrounds are being identified. “Our teams are talking to farmers, small businessmen and domestic users to onboard them for P2P energy trading,” Gupta said.The programme is aimed primarily at smart meter users. Buyers must have a smart electricity meter, while sellers need a rooftop solar plant supported by a net meter. Before taking part, consumers will undergo verification by their respective discoms and will be onboarded through approved digital trading platforms.A ‘Verified Credential’ will serve as the digital identity of each participant, confirming that the consumer or prosumer is genuine and eligible. This is intended to maintain system integrity while enabling secure transactions.Under the peer-to-peer model, buyers and sellers will negotiate prices directly through a mobile application. The transactions will run on a secure, blockchain-enabled framework under the India Energy Stack, ensuring they are verifiable and scalable.Unlike the conventional arrangement in which surplus electricity is sold back to a discom at a predetermined tariff, this mechanism allows both sides to mutually decide the rate. Officials said consumers will continue to receive their standard electricity bills, with P2P trades reflected as cumulative adjustments within the billing system.The physical supply of electricity will remain the responsibility of the discoms. What changes is the financial settlement: energy bought or sold through the platform will be integrated into monthly bills.Authorities say the arrangement will help prosumers monetise extra generation, while buyers will be able to access electricity at prices below prevailing discom tariffs.To make the pilot attractive, DERC has waived wheeling charges, cross-subsidy surcharges and other additional levies within Delhi’s territorial limits until the trial period ends. A transaction fee of 42 paise per unit has been approved, to be shared equally between the buyer and the seller.In another key relaxation, the regulator has lifted the earlier 20% capacity utilisation factor cap, allowing prosumers to sell their entire surplus output. The stated aim is to build a consumer-centric, digitally governed energy ecosystem.REC Limited, which is developing the India Energy Stack, said the platform will manage matching, accounting and settlements. REC executive director Prince Dhawan said, “The platform will read data from a central ledger where the discom will upload actual consumption and export, and then settle the final transaction between peers. Some trading platforms will also have inbuilt AI agents to help customers in the trading process. ”“As per regulatory approvals, discoms can apply wheeling and transmission charges directly in the bills since they can also read the ledger. The platform will display those charges upfront to consumers,” he added.A spokesperson for Tata Power-DDL outlined how consumers would access the system. “Customers will have to download one of the applications developed by trading platform service providers as per their preference. Details regarding user interfaces, including whether a dedicated app or web-based access will be shared at the time of onboarding by the respective discoms,” the spokesperson said.",The Delhi Electricity Regulatory Commission (DERC) has approved a framework allowing consumers to trade electricity directly with one another.

These include themed storefronts and interactive layouts built around gifting needs for the season. Zepto marked the start of the period with an on-ground event titled ‘Valentine’s Prom Night’.“We have seen a massive surge in Valentine’s gifting this year, with key categories like jewellery, greeting cards, and plush toys growing up to 10X year-on-year,” a spokesperson for Instamart told ET. “Notably, the sexual wellness category has more than tripled.”Competition to attract younger consumers is intensifying. Flipkart Minutes has introduced a dedicated section called RelationShop on its platform. “We have recorded 8X year-over-year growth (February 7-11, 2025 vs. February 7-11, 2026) and anticipate a 7X surge in overall demand this year,” Flipkart spokesperson told ET.At the same time, D2C brands supplying through these channels are also reporting strong traction.MyMuse, which sells sexual wellness products, is seeing sales climb 50–60% year-on-year across quick commerce marketplaces.“This is our third Valentine’s Day on quick commerce and each year the demand is increasing,” said Sahil Gupta, cofounder of MyMuse. “The number of brand searches on platforms have significantly increased as well.”Experts say speed and privacy are central to the appeal for many buyers. Rajat Jadhav, cofounder and chief executive of men’s sexual health and wellness brand Bold Care, linked the seasonal bump to changing conversations around intimacy.“Valentine’s is significant as it changes the mood around intimacy,” he said, adding, “It is one of the few times in the year when people talk about it openly, without overthinking or hesitation. We see that convert into higher curiosity and a lot of first-time buyers.”While February 13 and 14 remain the busiest days because of last-minute shopping, companies note that spending is now distributed across the broader Valentine’s week. “We usually see a 4X spike in revenue, which is from January 15 to February 14, so those 30 days is what we capture,” said said Twishaa Gupta, cofounder of fashion and accessories brand Salty. “This year, targets are super high and we want to close somewhere around Rs 20 crore for just this month. ”Data from Unicommerce also highlights the scale of the build-up, with the firm registering a 48% year-on-year jump in quick commerce orders between February 1 and 10.For the occasion, platforms have assembled curated lists linked to days such as Rose Day, Chocolate Day, Promise Day and Hug Day. “Carts are bigger, more premium, and the celebration now spans an entire week, signalling a clear move from impulse buys to planned, thoughtful gifting,” the spokesperson from Instamart said, adding that the company increased inventory across dark stores in advance and expanded staffing and delivery partners to handle volumes.","February 14 is emerging as a big sales opportunity for quick commerce firms and digital-first brands. People are shopping for fashion, jewellery, beauty, personal care and sexual wellness products. platforms such as Zepto, Blinkit and Instamart began activating special features on their apps from February 7.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128337218,imgsize-111231,width-400,resizemode-4/ai-generated-image.jpg"

China will remove tariffs on imports from almost all African countries starting May 1, Chinese President Xi Jinping said, according to state media, in a move expected to deepen trade and economic engagement between Beijing and the continent, AFP reported.China already operates a zero-tariff policy for imports from 33 African countries, but Beijing had announced last year that it would expand the policy to all 53 African countries with which it has diplomatic relations.Under the expanded framework, zero levies will apply to all African nations except Eswatini, which maintains diplomatic relations with Taiwan. China claims the democratic island as its own and has not ruled out the use of force to assert control over it.China remains Africa’s largest trading partner and has played a major role in infrastructure development across the continent through its Belt and Road Initiative.The move comes at a time when several African countries are diversifying trade relationships, particularly after US President Donald Trump imposed steep tariffs globally last year.Xi said the zero-tariff arrangement “will undoubtedly provide new opportunities for African development”, while announcing the timeline as leaders across Africa gathered in Ethiopia for the annual African Union summit.The expansion of tariff-free access is expected to strengthen China’s economic influence in Africa while boosting trade flows and market access for African exporters.","China will remove tariffs on imports from almost all African countries starting May 1.

Short-term loan dependence puts Pakistan’s economic stability at risk,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/short-term-loan-dependence-puts-pakistans-economic-stability-at-risk/articleshow/128338198.cms,"Representative image (AI)

Pak PM Shehbaz Sharif Says He Begged For Funds With Asim Munir As Pakistan Buys Global Influence

The economy of Pakistan is in a risky state due to its over-reliance on short-term foreign loans, according to business leaders and economists. Key figures are calling for urgent negotiations with friendly nations to extend loan repayment periods and implement structural reforms, as reported by Express Tribune.Vice chairman of the Pakistan industrial and traders associations front (PIAF) Raja Waseem Hassan warned that without extending loan maturities, the country will continue to face balance-of-payments problems. While foreign reserves have grown to $21 billion in January 2026, experts say this improvement relies too heavily on temporary support from international institutions and friendly countries.""The government must immediately begin serious negotiations with friendly nations to secure longer repayment periods and ease pressure on foreign exchange reserves,"" said Hassan. He welcomed recent positive diplomatic developments with Gulf states and the United States but cautioned that these relationships can change quickly.The country's trade performance remains concerning. Exports stood at $32 billion in FY25, while imports continue to exceed export earnings. Dr. Saleem Ahmed, a senior economist, warned that Pakistan can't rely forever on rollovers and short-term deposits. He suggests the country needs 5-6 per cent annual growth to stabilize its debt-to-GDP ratio, which currently hovers around 70 per cent.Economic growth prospects remain modest. The IMF expects 3.6% GDP growth for FY26, while the State Bank of Pakistan projects 3.75-4.75%. Though inflation has dropped from its 38% peak in 2023, strict monetary policies have slowed industrial growth and business lending.Experts recommended focusing on export-oriented sectors like textiles, IT, and agricultural processing. They suggest improving tax collection, reducing energy waste, and boosting remittances, which could reach $42 billion in FY26. They also stress the need to increase foreign direct investment beyond its current annual level of $1.5-2 billion to reduce dependency on external borrowing.Hassan pointedout that while Pakistan's military importance can help in diplomacy, economic strength is crucial for long-term stability. ""Economic strength must be the real shield. Without strong buffers and self-reliance, external partnerships alone cannot guarantee stability,"" he said.","Pakistan's economy is in a risky state due to its over-reliance on short-term foreign loans.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 109 points, or 0.2%, as of 9:35 a.m. Eastern time, while the Nasdaq Composite slipped 0.3%, AP reported.Treasury yields declined in the bond market after data showed inflation cooled more than economists had expected last month. Consumer prices were 2.4% higher year-on-year, lower than December’s 2.7%, though still above the Federal Reserve’s 2% target. An underlying inflation measure — considered a better predictor of future price trends — slowed to its lowest level in nearly five years.“It’s still too high, but only for now, not forever,” said Brian Jacobsen, chief economic strategist at Annex Wealth Management.Cooling inflation could provide the Federal Reserve greater room to cut interest rates if required. While the Fed has paused rate cuts for now, markets broadly expect easing to resume later this year.Lower borrowing costs could support economic growth and equity markets, though they also carry the risk of reigniting inflation.The broader economic backdrop also appears stronger compared to late 2025, supported by easing inflation and stronger-than-expected job market data last month.The yield on the 10-year US Treasury fell to 4.06% from 4.09% on Thursday.On Wall Street, stocks of companies previously seen as vulnerable to AI disruption stabilised.

The administration of US President Donald Trump has added several major Chinese companies, including Alibaba and Baidu, to a Pentagon list of firms allegedly supporting China’s military, increasing pressure on Beijing ahead of an expected meeting between leaders of the two countries, according to a Reuters report.The Pentagon’s 1260H list does not directly impose sanctions on the companies. However, under a new US law, the Department of Defense will be barred in the coming years from contracting with or procuring from companies included on the list.Other companies added on Friday include automaker BYD, biotech firm WuXi AppTec and AI-driven robotics company RoboSense Technology Co Ltd. Meanwhile, memory chip maker YMTC was removed from the list.Inclusion in the list also signals to Pentagon suppliers and other US government agencies the military’s assessment of these firms. Some companies listed earlier have challenged their inclusion through legal routes.Responding to the move, an Alibaba spokesperson told Reuters that there was no basis for the inclusion and indicated possible legal action. “Alibaba is not a Chinese military company nor part of any military-civil fusion strategy.”The update to the list could strain ties between Washington and Beijing, particularly after a trade truce agreed between Chinese President Xi Jinping and US President Donald Trump in October.The list already includes major Chinese firms such as Tencent Holdings and battery maker CATL. Tencent had earlier said its business would remain unaffected and that it would seek reconsideration, while CATL said it was “not engaged in any military-related activities”.US lawmakers had earlier urged the Pentagon to expand the list to include several Chinese technology companies, including AI firm DeepSeek, smartphone maker Xiaomi and display manufacturer BOE Technology.Along with YMTC, some firms included last year --such as COSCO SHIPPING Finance Co Ltd and ChangXin Memory Technologies Inc -- have now been removed from the list.","US President Donald Trump has added several major Chinese companies to a Pentagon list of firms allegedly supporting China's military.

UNMISSABLE: Names Of 6 'HIDDEN' Global Figures Finally Released In Unredacted Epstein Files | WATCH

Dubai-based port operator DP World on Friday announced new leadership, replacing long-time chief Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem after documents linked to the Epstein files revealed frequent correspondence between him and the convicted sex offender.""DP World announced the appointment of His Excellency Essa Kazim as Chairman of its Board of Directors and the appointment of Yuvraj Narayan as Group Chief Executive Officer,"" the group said in a statement published by the Dubai media office.The statement did not reference Sulayem.Previously serving as group chairman and chief executive officer of DP World, one of the world’s largest port operators, Sulayem was described by Jeffrey Epstein as one of his “most trusted friends.”He is cited more than 9,400 times in documents recently released by the US Department of Justice, which detail what they describe as close ties between the two men.According to the records, they maintained regular correspondence from 2009 to 2018, exchanging messages on personal matters, meetings, introductions and business opportunities.At the time, Epstein portrayed the wealthy Emirati businessman as being close to Dubai’s ruler, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid.The correspondence also indicates that Sulayem visited Epstein at his residence in the United States on multiple occasions, including trips to his private island.DP World is one of the world’s largest port operators, responsible for a significant share of global container traffic.Epstein, who died in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges, has long been known for cultivating ties with powerful individuals across sectors. The newly released files underscore that even after his conviction, Epstein continued to connect with influential figures.For example, other reporting on the 2026 release shows Epstein’s role in facilitating meetings between business leaders and politicians, including those linked to UAE-Israel diplomatic backchannels and investment networks.","Long-time DP World chief Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem replaced by Essa Kazim.

"US inflation cools to 2.4% in January, near five-year low as gas and housing costs ease",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-inflation-cools-to-2-4-in-january-near-five-year-low-as-gas-and-housing-costs-ease/articleshow/128310871.cms,"A key measure of US inflation fell to nearly a five-year low in January as apartment rental price growth slowed and gas prices declined, offering some relief to consumers after years of sharp cost increases.Inflation dropped to 2.4% in January compared with a year earlier, down from 2.7% in December and moving closer to the Federal Reserve’s 2% target, AP reported. Core prices, which exclude volatile food and energy categories, rose 2.5% year-on-year in January, down from 2.6% the previous month and marking the smallest increase since March 2021.The data suggests inflationary pressures could be easing, though it comes after prices of food, fuel and housing surged following the pandemic, leaving overall consumer prices about 25% higher than five years ago. The broad rise in costs has become a major political issue around affordability.On a monthly basis, consumer prices rose 0.2% in January from December, while core prices increased 0.3%.The report may signal cooling inflation, though economists note that prices often rise more in January as companies reset pricing at the start of the year. While gas prices are expected to have declined, grocery costs could see upward pressure after rising in December.Inflation had surged to 9.1% in 2022 amid strong consumer spending and supply chain disruptions following the pandemic. It declined through 2023, stabilised around 3% by mid-2024, and has since improved only gradually.Inflation softened slightly in late 2025, partly reflecting distortions caused by a six-week government shutdown that disrupted data collection, leading to estimates for housing costs that economists said may have artificially lowered inflation readings.At the same time, wage growth has slowed as hiring momentum weakened, reducing workers’ bargaining power. Lower wage growth can ease inflation pressure as businesses face less cost pressure to raise prices.More moderate wage gains are a key reason many economists expect inflation to continue easing this year.“We're not expecting inflation to start up again by any stretch,” said Luke Tilley, chief economist for Wilmington Trust, AP quoted him as saying.Some businesses are still absorbing tariff-related costs, though economists expect companies may raise prices in coming months to offset those expenses. However, most forecasts suggest inflation will decline further by the second half of the year and move closer to the Federal Reserve’s 2% target by the end of 2026.","Inflation dropped to 2.4% in January compared with a year earlier, down from 2.7% in December.

India is in discussions with China-related Ant International to allow integration of the digital payments platform Alipay+ with the country’s instant payments system, Unified Payments Interface (UPI). The move could ease cross-border transactions for Indian travellers across merchants that have signed up with Alipay+, Reuters reported, citing two government sources.This would heavily simplify the overseas spending and reduce the costs associated with cross-border payments.Ant International, headquartered in Singapore and founded by China’s Ant Group, now operates independently.According to Reuters, talks between Indian government and central bank officials with the firm indicate a thaw in bilateral economic engagement between New Delhi and Beijing.Alipay+ currently connects about 1.8 billion user accounts with more than 150 million merchants across over 100 markets, including several in Asia, Europe, the Middle East, and Latin America.Meanwhile, UPI has become a cornerstone of India’s fintech infrastructure, handling nearly 18 billion transactions monthly.Indian authorities have been keen to extend UPI’s international reach to enable smoother digital payments in Indian rupees for travellers and overseas Indians.However, final approval for the Alipay+ integration will depend on security evaluations.“There are sensitivities involved in terms of geopolitical positioning or in securing the country’s digital infrastructure and data because of Alipay’s roots in China,” Reuters reported, citing sources.India continues to enforce strict investment regulations for Chinese firms introduced after the 2020 border standoff, and those curbs remain in place.Strained relations between India and China after their 2020 border standoff slowed the flow of capital, technology and talent between the two neighbours, with New Delhi tightening scrutiny of investments by China-based firms or those with China-linked ownership, according to Reuters. The curbs have stalled or delayed several projects, including Chinese electric vehicle maker BYD’s proposed 1 billion dollar investment plan in an India EV venture.In the past year, however, India has begun cautiously rekindling engagement with Beijing as it navigates punishing U.S. tariffs and shifting global trade patterns, officials said.Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited China in 2025 for the first time in seven years and discussed ways to improve ties in a meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping.","India is in discussions with China-related Ant International to allow integration of the digital payments platform Alipay+ with the country’s instant payments system, Unified Payments Interface (UPI) The move could ease cross- border transactions for Indian travellers across merchants that have signed up with the platform.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128307560,imgsize-750127,width-400,resizemode-4/upi-and-alipay-talks.jpg"

Their rapid development has intensified concerns among companies that fear being left behind.In commodities, bullion experienced some of the sharpest selling of the week, with gold dipping below $4,900 an ounce and silver sliding to $74. Even so, the moves stopped short of the dramatic swings seen earlier in the month that had unsettled market participants.The next potential catalyst comes from the United States, where inflation data are due later on Friday. Wednesday’s strong jobs report has already led many traders to temper bets on a Federal Reserve rate cut at its upcoming meeting.With the economic outlook appearing somewhat firmer than previously feared, a growing consensus is forming that policymakers may instead wait until July before delivering the next reduction.","In Hong Kong, HSI fell 542 points or 2.01% to 26,489.

China EXPLODES At Israel's Invasion Bid After Trump & 8 Muslim Nations | 'Not Your TERRITORY'

China has intensified efforts to cement its dominance over rare earth metals as the United States moves to build a broad international coalition to secure critical mineral supply chains, official and media reports said.Chinese Premier Li Qiang this week visited Ganzhou in Jiangxi province — one of the world’s largest heavy rare earth production bases — underscoring Beijing’s strategic focus on the sector that underpins advanced manufacturing and technology. Li inspected key producers, research institutions including the Chinese Academy of Sciences’ Ganjiang Innovation Academy, and held talks with local business leaders and scientists, according to Chinese state media Xinhua.South China Morning Post quoted Li as saying, “The value of rare earths in boosting advanced manufacturing and green, low‑carbon transformation is increasingly prominent,” highlighting the role of these metals in high-tech and clean-energy industriesChina currently accounts for around 70 % of global rare earth mining and nearly 90 % of processing capacity, giving it substantial leverage in disputes with the United States and other major economies.Beijing’s tightened export controls last year led to disruptions in supply to the US, the EU, India, and other nations, prompting Washington to accelerate efforts to diversify sources of the minerals, which are essential for electronics, automobiles, wind turbines, and defence equipment.According to news agency PTI, China’s restrictions on rare earth supplies previously forced US President Donald Trump to agree to resume shipments to Washington in exchange for tariff concessions and lifting a semiconductor export ban.In response, the Trump administration this month launched a major initiative to form a metallic alliance with more than 50 nations, including India, aimed at securing critical mineral supply chains and reducing reliance on China. As part of this strategy, the US has unveiled a USD 12 billion stockpile plan dubbed “Project Vault” to finance domestic and allied mining and processing.Li also chaired a State Council meeting to push AI-driven innovation, emphasising the integration of data, computing, electricity, network resources, and hardware-software synergy to strengthen China’s technological edge, South China Morning Post reported.",China has intensified efforts to cement its dominance over rare earth metals.

Futures tied to the S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average and Nasdaq were each up about 0.3%.McDonald’s shares moved higher after the fast-food chain beat fourth-quarter revenue and profit projections, helped by the re-launch of its Extra Value Meal. In contrast, pest control firm Rollins slumped 13% after missing Wall Street’s fourth-quarter sales and profit estimates.Investors are closely watching labour market signals after the US Labor Department said employers added 130,000 jobs in January, exceeding economists’ expectations.The strong payroll data “strengthens the case for higher US Treasury yields and a rebound in the dollar over the coming months,” Jonas Goltermann, deputy chief markets economist at Capital Economics, said in a note, as quoted AP. He added that stabilising labour conditions suggest the chances of another Federal Reserve rate cut in the near term are “quite low”.Markets are also tracking upcoming US existing home sales data for further economic cues.In Europe, Britain’s FTSE rose 0.2% by midday, Germany’s DAX advanced 1.3%, and France’s CAC 40 gained 0.9%.In Asia, Japan’s Nikkei 225 briefly crossed the 58,000 level before closing slightly lower at 57,639.84 after trading resumed post-holiday.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 222 points, or 0.4%, while the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.5% as of 9:35 am Eastern time, AP reported.Treasury yields also climbed after the US Labor Department said employers added 130,000 jobs last month, higher than economists’ expectations of 75,000. The stronger data helped ease concerns triggered a day earlier by a report indicating US household spending may be slowing.However, revisions in the report showed employers added only 181,000 jobs for the whole of last year, sharply lower than the previously reported 584,000, marking the weakest annual performance since 2020 when the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted the economy.“We all knew there would be downward revisions, but these were better than expected,” Brian Jacobsen, chief economic strategist at Annex Wealth Management, said.Energy and industrial stocks led gains in the S&P 500, reflecting optimism around economic activity. Caterpillar rose 3.9%, while Exxon Mobil gained 2.4%.The gains offset declines in some stocks. Moderna fell 10.5% after saying the US Food and Drug Administration is refusing to consider its application for a new flu vaccine made using mRNA technology. The move reflects heightened regulatory scrutiny of vaccines under Health Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr.Robinhood Markets dropped 11% despite reporting stronger-than-expected quarterly profit, as revenue missed forecasts and analysts flagged concerns about rising expenses in 2026 and weak crypto trading volumes.Kraft Heinz declined 4.1% despite posting better-than-expected quarterly results.

NEW DELHI: More than 1.14 lakh startups in India have created over 12 lakh jobs so far, the finance ministry said in its latest review of the Indian economy.In the report titled, ‘The Indian Economy: A Review January 2024’, the Department of Economic Affairs said that the 1.14 lakh startups recognised by the government under the 'Startup India initiative’ created more than 12 lakh jobs (as of October 2023).The state-owned e-commerce platform Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC) clocked more than 63 lakh transactions till November 2023, the document read.Despite facing global challenges in 2023 like valuation issues, few IPOs, regulatory changes and macroeconomic and geopolitical trends, India remains the third largest tech start-up ecosystem globally, with over 950 tech startups founded last year.The cumulative funding for more than 31,000 tech start ups has exceeded $70 billion (from 2019 to 2023), according to a recent report by Nasscom in collaboration with Zinnov.“In 2023, despite facing global economic and regulatory challenges, Indian tech startups have prioritised the imperative of enhancing their business fundamentals, driving profitability and growth,” said Debjani Ghosh, President, Nasscom.“The proliferation of tech startups in tier 2 and 3 cities marks the ecosystem's resilience,” she added.Navigating 2024, tech startup founders expect to continue the revenue growth path with measured steps focusing on optimising expenditure and maximising profitability for B2B tech startups.Investments in deeptech will continue an upward trend in 2024. With generative AI (GenAI) acceleration, 70 per cent of start-up founders are embedding artificial intelligence (AI) in their solutions.As funding becomes scarce for the Indian startup ecosystem in general, the explosion of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has given a new lease of life to entrepreneurs and founders in the country, as the Centre extends support to the sector.","The state-owned e-commerce platform Open Network for Digital Commerce clocked more than 63 lakh transactions till November 2023.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground.Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change, too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain and boost vendor partnerships ahead of a stock market debut planned for 2025.The Series E round was done via a combination of fresh equity and conversion of debt, the Bangalore-based company said in a statement Thursday. The round was led by M&G Plc and existing investors including Lightspeed Venture Partners and DST Global participated.The round “fully funds our business plan,” Vaibhav Gupta, Udaan co-founder and chief executive officer, said in the statement. “It enables our continued journey of growth and profitability, positioning us well to be public-market ready in the next 12-18 months.”Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, runs an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business, though a very small part of India’s overall retail market, is expected to swell to $150 billion in sales in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co.The startup targets an initial public offering in 2025, though it’s yet to decide whether it will do so in India or overseas, Gupta told Bloomberg News last month.Udaan was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran the company until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021.

E-Commerce startup Udaan to trim costs ahead of 2025 IPO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/e-commerce-startup-udaan-to-trim-costs-ahead-of-2025-ipo/articleshow/105001132.cms,"E-commerce startup Udaan is working to curb costs and forge new partnerships with consumer brands in India as it prepares to go public in 2025.Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta said in an interview. That’s set to happen around the same time as its initial public offering, he said.The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said. “Second, strategically we want to ensure that we are top of mind with shopkeepers, with big manufacturers, and we maintain our relative market share.”Lightspeed Venture Partners-backed Udaan is among startups trying to tap the rapid growth of India’s economy and consumer market, while meeting investor demands for profitability. Udaan, which at its peak employed thousands, joined fellow Indian startups in slashing jobs last year and tightening internal controls and compliance. It now has about 1,800 staff, and Gupta didn’t specify if further job cuts are needed.Corporate governance lapses at Indian online tutoring firm Byju’s, once the country’s top startup with a valuation of $22 billion, shone a light at unique challenges faced by founders in the South Asian nation and drove companies to be more diligent.“We continue to move towards more professionalized management, professionalized board and also institutionalized shareholders as we go towards public markets,” Gupta said.Udaan is yet to decide whether it will list in India or overseas. It was valued at more than $3 billion in a 2021 funding round, and was in talks to raise $400 million, Business Standard reported in September.

That kind of digital-led wholesale business still accounts for a very small part of India’s overall retail market but can balloon to $150 billion in sales and yield a 100% return on capital invested in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co. estimates published in the Mint newspaper.Bengaluru-based Udaan has also ventured into financing through its fintech unit which helps shopkeepers get working capital loans to buy inventory. That business is profitable before taxes and is growing 70% annually, Gupta said.“That’s a second business in the overall umbrella of Udaan trying to organize trade in the country,” Gupta said. “In addition to commerce, financing becomes an important market opportunity.”","Udaan will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta says. Udaan competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods. The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-105001128,imgsize-151312,width-400,resizemode-4/105001128.jpg"

Stock market recommendations:Nifty in the last three sessions witnessed a pullback of around 500 points after the sharp decline of 16% in the preceding 5 months as value buying emerged around the key support range of 21,700-22,000. This pullback can be attributed to several factors, including the strength in Asian and European markets, bargain buying in oversold stocks and value buying in blue-chip stocks. The index had been extremely oversold, having declined for 10 consecutive sessions, making the pullback overdue from the deeply oversold zone.Nifty holding above the support area of 21,700-22,000 is expected to extend the pullback towards 22,800 in coming weeks. Key resistance on the higher side is placed at 22,800-23,000 being the confluence of 20 days EMA and recent breakdown area.Nifty has strong support at 22,000-21,700 levels being the confluence of theFactors that support the pullback in the Indian markets in the coming week:Bank Nifty has relatively outperformed the Nifty in the recent weeks and has been consolidating in the last 8 weeks in the broad range of 47,800-50,500. We expect the index to extend the consolidation in the coming weeks. Only a breakout or breakdown in any direction will signal the next directional move in the index.A breach below the lower band of the range will lead to extended decline towards 47,000 levels in the coming sessions. While holding above the support area of will lead to pullback towards the 49,000 levels in the coming sessions.The stock has generated a breakout above the falling channel of the last 6 months signaling reversal of the corrective trend and offers fresh entry opportunity. Buying demand has recently emerged after base at the 200 weeks EMA.The weekly 14 periods RSI has generated a buy signal with a positive divergence. We expect the stock to head higher towards 1230 levels in the coming month being the 38.2% retracement of the entire decline (1605-996)The stock has generated a breakout above last 5 weeks consolidation range (1027-978) signaling resumption of up move thus offers fresh entry opportunity.The daily RSI is in uptrend and has also generated a trendline breakout. We expect the stock to head higher towards 1114 levels being the previous breakdown area and 50% retracement of the entire decline (1339-933).","According to Bajaj Broking Research, Adani Ports and Axis Bank are the top stock picks for today.

RIL share price : Reliance Industries (RIL) shares have experienced significant decline, dropping 25% from their peak of Rs 1,608.95 on BSE on July 8. Foreign institutional investors ' selling amid retail slowdown and weak refining margins has led to a Rs 5.4 lakh crore erosion in value. The stock's performance has lagged behind Nifty by 10% since January 2024, creating widespread negative sentiment, according to an ET report.Recent trading sessions show a 4% recovery in RIL shares, indicating possible value buying at lower levels. The sustainability of this recovery remains uncertain.Jefferies analysts consider current valuations excessively negative, pointing out that the market capitalisation suggests an enterprise value of $48 billion for RIL's retail division, substantially below the $106 billion valuation from its previous funding round. They anticipate 15% retail growth in FY26, supported by same-store sales growth and expansion. Additional positive factors include potential tariff increases, Jio's listing prospects, and O2C business improvement.

The company's ARPU growth potential remains strong, considering previous tariff adjustments haven't fully materialised in revenues.Kotak Institutional Equities has elevated their rating to 'Buy' with a Rs 1,400 target price. Despite slight downward revisions in FY26/27 EBITDA forecasts, they project 11% earnings CAGR through FY24-27.

""Valuations are definitely comforting, but the only segment doing well is Jio. We expect another price hike, but retail remains sluggish outside of end-of-season sales. Oil and gas margins have yet to improve, and FIIs have been dumping oil and gas stocks, which dampens any near-term upside,"" he said.FII ownership in RIL has seen a significant decline since September 2022, dropping from 23.6% in Q2 of FY23 to 19.6% in Q3 of FY25. The energy sector has witnessed additional FII withdrawals of Rs 5,000 crore in the past two months.The refining sector faces challenges due to heightened Russian sanctions and US tariff implications. RIL's O2C division continues to experience pressure from weak global refining margins and low petrochemical spreads.RIL's current valuation might present an opportunity, considering the extensive negative sentiment already reflected in prices. The company's underperformance compared to the Nifty indicates thorough pricing of adverse factors. Potential improvement in Jio's performance, retail sector stabilisation, and O2C division recovery could trigger positive revaluation.The recent 4% increase in share price indicates renewed investor interest, though uncertainty remains about whether this represents a sustained recovery or temporary uptick.","Reliance Industries (RIL) shares have experienced significant decline, dropping 25% from their peak of Rs 1,608.95 on BSE on July 8.

Infosys work from office rules: Infosys, the second-largest software services firm in India, has issued a directive on Wednesday requiring its technology staff to comply with the work from office for 10 days monthly mandate, aiming to increase on-campus attendance. Infosys has implemented a new attendance system via a mobile application that mandates employees to be physically present at their designated office locations for at least 10 days monthly. The system will not automatically approve work-from-home requests, according to a senior staff member who requested not to be named.A colleague mentioned this requirement is primarily driven by project needs rather than departmental demands.Department heads at the Bengaluru-based organisation sent emails to their team members, instructing them to restrict their work-from-home requests starting March 10, according to sources who spoke to ET.Also Read | How will Elon Musk-led DOGE’s slashing of federal spending impact Indian IT companies? The email reportedly said: ""To support this, starting March 10, 2025, system interventions will be implemented to limit the number of work-from-home days that can be applied each month. These measures are designed to ensure compliance with the new hybrid work requirements while maintaining flexibility for employees.""A senior executive explained that this systematic approach aims to foster better team collaboration whilst maintaining workplace flexibility.The email further said: ""As you know, our hybrid work model expects employees to work from the office for at least 10 days a month, or as per business requirements, whichever is higher.""This directive specifically affects staff at job level 5 (JL5) and below, encompassing team leaders, software engineers, senior engineers, system engineers and consultants. Whilst JL6 and above positions, including managers, senior managers, delivery managers and senior delivery managers (excluding vice presidents), are not included in this mandate.Another staff member expressed concerns about the policy, noting that remote work had provided benefits in terms of reduced travel time and physical strain.

Stock market today : Indian benchmark indices, BSE Sensex and Nifty50 , remained largely unchanged on Friday, following a 2% increase in the previous two sessions. While Reliance Industries showed positive movement, IT stocks declined amid worries about US tariffs and unstable trade policies affecting global markets .The BSE Sensex finished at 74,332.58, down by 7.51 points or 0.01%, whilst the Nifty 50 settled at 22,552.50, up by 7.80 points or 0.03%.The total market value of BSE-listed companies decreased by Rs 697 crore to Rs 398.26 lakh crore.Technology stocks faced pressure, with the IT index dropping 0.9%, as these companies generate substantial revenue from the US market. Major tech firms Infosys and HCL Technologies saw declines exceeding 1.6%.Reliance Industries, ranking second in market weight among index constituents, recorded a 3% increase, leading gains across both indices.The automobile sector index concluded marginally higher by 0.1%, surrendering earlier gains. CLSA indicated that potential removal of import duties on US vehicles would not significantly affect Indian car manufacturers.In specific stock movements, Bharat Electronics gained 1.5% after receiving orders worth Rs 577 crore, whilst Gensol Engineering continued its downward trend for the eighth straight session, falling 2.5% following credit rating downgrades by CARE and ICRA.The property sector index Nifty Realty fell by 1.2%, with prominent developers like Godrej Properties, Lodha, Prestige Estates, and Raymond seeing declines of 2-3%.The previous two trading sessions had witnessed the Nifty 50 and BSE Sensex rise approximately 2% each, supported by positive sentiment regarding potential US tariff reductions on Canadian and Mexican imports, lower oil prices, and value buying following recent market declines.Following Indian trading hours on Thursday, US President Donald Trump declared the suspension of 25% tariffs on the majority of Mexican and Canadian imports, further complicating an already unpredictable trade policy that has disrupted international financial markets.Investors maintained a cautious stance whilst awaiting crucial US employment statistics and Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's address.Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services, noted that global markets face significant uncertainty due to US tariff implementations and retaliatory threats from trading partners. This uncertainty has reduced risk appetite and equity attractiveness, with emerging markets particularly affected by substantial capital outflows.""Lately, the S&P 500 index is showing signs of a deeper correction, reflecting concerns about the potential impact of tariffs on the US economy. In contrast, Indian markets have demonstrated resilience off late despite looming trade war. While a recovery in corporate earnings could significantly improve the domestic sentiments.

India Inc is striving to reimagine workplaces, championing inclusivity, diversity, and gender parity in a highly disruptive, tech-driven world to spark a pink edge.Companies are ramping up efforts to attract and retain women talent with targeted leadership programmes, cutting-edge AI upskilling, and enhanced flexibility that nurtures work-life balance. In this drive for a more equitable environment, equal opportunities have taken center stage - eclipsing salary and benefits as a defining priority for women-signaling a shift toward cultures that prioritise growth, fairness, and purpose.In the post-pandemic return-to-office (RTO) era, flexibility has become a lifeline for women balancing professional and personal demands. Over half of Indian employees - 52% - would leave a job lacking sufficient flexibility, according to Randstad Workmonitor Survey 2025. Women tend to place more importance on work-life balance, it adds.Viswanath P S, MD & CEO of Randstad India, a talent company, says, ""Women are actively seeking greater flexibility, meaningful career development, and upskilling opportunities, particularly in AI and emerging technologies. The demand for full-time remote work is also significantly higher among women.""A bunch of companies including TCS and Accenture offer flexible work options, while some like Meesho include hybrid work policies to promote better work-life balance.Govindraj M K, CHRO at Myntra, says, ""We provide additional flexibility through our MynVive: Myntra Ramp-back Programme, which offers new mothers and primary caregivers options offering extended flexibility, such as sabbatical leave for up to 24 weeks and the option to work at 50% capacity for three months post-maternity.""However, many companies are insisting on a strict return to office. Rituparna Chakraborty, co-founder TeamLease, cautions, ""The result will be that organisations that embrace AI to enable personalised learning, hybrid work and career paths, and flexible working will be able to attract and retain the best female talent.""As industries adapt to tech advancements, the demand for skills that align with innovation and adaptability has never been higher. As AI (artificial intelligence) and automation disrupt sectors, the workforce needs to be equipped with new tools to stay ahead of the curve. Yet, there is still a considerable gap in terms of availability, coverage, and quality.Nishchae Suri, MD-India, Cornerstone OnDemand, says, ""As AI continues to transform industries, investing in targeted upskilling programmes for women is essential to cultivate an inclusive, agile workforce.""Encouragingly, job opportunities for women in India have surged by 48% in 2025, with notable growth in emerging tech fields.However, to fully harness this potential, organisations must address persistent upskilling gaps. Chakraborty says, ""Most AI training programmes are not targeted at specific issues that women face, such as the lack of mentors in tech and biased skill tests. The attention should move to the development of career acceleration programmes that are available to all women, free from bias, and in line with their work preferences.""Flexible work models, structured career re-entry programmes, and targeted Learning & Development (L&D) and upskilling must anchor talent management for women employees, equipping them to navigate the future of work with resilience & agility.","Over half of Indian employees - 52% - would leave a job lacking sufficient flexibility, according to Randstad Workmonitor Survey 2025.

This is the second time the regulator has shortened his tenure from what was initially proposed by the bank's board.In a filing to stock exchanges on Friday, IndusInd Bank said RBI approved Kathpalia's reappointment for an additional year, from March 24, 2025, to March 23, 2026. In Sept 2022, the bank's board had approved his reappointment for three years, effective March 24, 2023, but RBI sanctioned only a two-year term. In Sept 2024, the board again sought a three-year extension, from March 24, 2025, to March 23, 2028, but RBI has now approved only a one-year extension.Kathpalia, who has over 37 years of experience, took charge as MD and CEO on March 24, 2020. Before joining IndusInd Bank 17 years ago, he worked at Citibank, Bank of America, and ABN AMRO.Under his leadership, IndusInd Bank has focused on strengthening its balance sheet, expanding its retail deposit base, diversifying its portfolio, maintaining capital adequacy, and driving digital transformation. He has also worked on improving investor confidence and governance frameworks.""Kathpalia has led the bank's core executive team, overseeing its turnaround and focusing on business growth, profitability, digitisation, and compliance,"" the bank said in its filing.","Sumant Kathpalia has been appointed as MD and CEO of IndusInd Bank for one year.

The ET Awards this year promises a transformative experience.Seeing a baby become a star and then a legend is a unique experience. I feel rather like a fond family member as I set off to attend the 25th edition of the ET Awards for Corporate Excellence in Mumbai today, after a gap of many years. As part of the team that put together the very first awards ceremony half a lifetime ago, I am excited by the promise of a refreshing new twist to the event. Adding an element of mystery and surprise to the OG of corporate awards is a big ask, after all!When the ET Awards debuted, it was the pioneer in its sphere. It was, to us at least, a no-brainer: who else but India's largest business newspaper could (and should) initiate the formal recognition of India's industrial, corporate and entrepreneurial talent? That it set off a trend to honour this part of national life acknowledges that ET had correctly gauged the zeitgeist of an energised India on the cusp of a new millennium.I can't help but think that much like our armed forces marching down Kartavya Path on Republic Day or sports people winning medals or scientists pulling off a rocket launch evoke a feeling of immense pride, the women and men honoured with the ET Awards every year epitomise the great strides India is making in business and industry, propelling the economy to unprecedented heights. India was waiting for just such an event, to elicit pride in our growth story too.It is a testament to the depth and robustness of the Indian economy that amid the sea of young entrepreneurial talent, many of those who were present at the very first ET Awards - people as well corporate entities - are still there in the economic sphere, delivering growth and prosperity, amid an ever-evolving scenario of opportunities and challenges. The audience at the atmospheric NCPA auditorium in Mumbai will also reflect that continuity-and-change mantra, no doubt.It is pretty much the done thing for pioneers to sit back and dwell on the highs of the past quarter of a century, celebrate previous successes and perhaps even pat themselves on the back for the many prescient decisions recognising stars-in-the-making. No one would begrudge that indulgence. Somehow, though, I don't think that's what is on the cards this time to salute a landmark year for the ET Awards. The past will inform the future at the event but not in the conventional way.I gleaned a clue in the dress code mentioned in the invitation card: 'Alta Sartoria with a touch from nature', the Italian phrase made famous by the shows of that country's most famous designer duo. At one level it is literally 'high tailoring' but the implication is an elevated sense of occasion, of glamour and reflectiveness, of pizzazz and purpose, of style and substance. More so as the invitation also promises ""an experience of transformative artistry , achievement and hope.""In what is now a rather crowded field, ET Awards for Corporate Excellence still stands loftily apart, not merely because it is the acknowledged trailblazer but also because it invariably offers something special and thought-provoking to all those who are privileged to attend the programme. The surprise in store this time will soon be revealed, reported upon and read about, of course, but nothing beats seeing it in person. Which is why no one will want to miss it. Including me.","The 25th edition of the ET Awards for Corporate Excellence will take place in Mumbai today. The awards recognise industrial, corporate and entrepreneurial talent in India.

BENGALURU: Ten years ago, MNC IT companies boasted six women at the helm. Prominent leaders included Accenture India's chairman Rekha Menon, IBM's Vanitha Narayanan, HP's Neelam Dhawan, Capgemini's Aruna Jayanthi and Intel's Kumud Srinivasan. Back then, Meta (Facebook) was headed by Kirthiga Reddy. Several of these leaders managed firms with nearly 100,000 employees.Fast forward to today. MNCs remain steadfast in their commitment to increasing women leaders at the top. In contrast, despite higher representation of women at entry-level positions, women as leaders are still under-represented in Indian IT firms, with fewer examples at the top. Barring a handful of women in senior leadership roles, Indian IT companies look pale with poor representation of women in the C-suite. Wipro appointed Aparna Iyer as its CFO, while Suzanne Dann is the CEO of Americas 2. Infosys roped in Inderpreet Sawhney as its chief legal officer and chief compliance officer. Data shows that fewer women executives hold top management positions and report to the board in IT firms.MNCs, including global capability centres (GCCs), are taking the lead in promoting more women to senior leadership positions. India has 1,760 GCCs, with an increased focus on high-value services and ER&D. A Nasscom-Zinnov report showed that over the past five years, global roles in India expanded significantly, with more than 6,500 established positions. Interestingly, this included 1,100 women leaders holding global roles. Zinnov's data on GCCs showed that at the executive tier, women constitute 6.7% of the total workforce. The mid-level positions, with five-to-eight years of professional experience, are filled by 24.3% of women employees. Senior roles, which demand 9 to 12 years of experience, comprise 15.7% of the female workforce. GCCs employ 1.9 million people out of India's total tech talent pool of 5.8 million people.Lalitha Indrakanti, CEO of JLR Technology & Business Services India, said the difference between working in an IT services company and a GCC lies in depth of organisational understanding and expertise one develops over time. ""While policies for increasing women leadership pipeline are similar across both, GCCs offer greater stability, allowing women to stay in roles longer without shifting between client projects.""Karthik Padmanabhan, managing partner in tech consulting firm Zinnov, said the rise of women leaders in GCCs is being driven by structured interventions, targeted mentorship and a deliberate focus on increasing the contribution toward outcomes. ""India's GCCs have been instrumental in accelerating this shift, embedding gender diversity into core talent strategies, while aligning with global leadership frameworks,"" he said.MNCs have led the pack with several policy interventions to nurture promising women executives into senior leadership roles. These firms actively monitor their career advancement through mentorship programmes and encourage them to pursue international opportunities.Anuprita Bhattacharya, head of Merck IT Center (MITC), IT country head - India, said the growth of women in leadership has been 14.3% over the last five years. ""Beyond training and development, we ensure that women at Merck IT Centre gain real exposure - leading initiatives and engaging with influential leaders, both within the organisation and through our industry networks."" Sirisha Voruganti, CEO of Lloyds Technology, said, ""Our commitment to foster an inclusive workplace is exemplified through many initiatives, aimed at raising scopes for women.""","Despite higher representation of women at entry-level positions, women as leaders are still under-represented in Indian IT firms.

Walgreens Boots Alliance has been acquired by private equity firm Sycamore Partners in a deal worth nearly $10 billion, as the retailer seeks to turn around its fortunes after years of financial difficulties but still couldn't do it.Announcing the deal on Thursday, the pharmacy company said Sycamore would pay $11.45 per share, with the potential for shareholders to receive an additional $3 per share under certain conditions. The agreement would take the company private, allowing it to restructure its business away from the pressures of Wall Street. Tim Wentworth, Walgreens Boots Alliance CEO said, “Throughout our history, Walgreens Boots Alliance has played a critical role in the retail healthcare ecosystem. We are focused on making healthcare delivery more effective, convenient and affordable as we navigate the challenges of a rapidly evolving pharmacy industry and an increasingly complex and competitive retail landscape.""The CEO further added that Sycamore will provide the company with the expertise and experience of a partner with a strong track record of successful retail turnarounds.The buyout deal values Walgreens at almost $24 billion when including debt, and Sycamore’s offer represents a nearly 30 per cent premium on its share price from December, when reports of a possible sale first surfaced.Walgreens has also been working to boost its finances, including suspending its quarterly dividend, ending a 90-year streak, and reducing its stake in drug distributor Cencora to free up cash for debt repayment.Ultimately, improving cash flow remains a top priority, whether the company stays public or goes private. ""Management has not been shy about its push to improve the cash flow generation profile as part of the turnaround plan,"" Leerink Partners analyst Michael Cherny noted in a February report.Founded in 1901, Walgreens has been a public company since 1927 but has faced growing challenges in recent years, due to low prescription reimbursement rates, rising costs, increasing theft, and price-sensitive customers shifting to cheaper alternatives. The company already began a restructuring process, including plans to close 1,200 of its roughly 8,500 US stores. This follows a previous downsizing, which saw it reduce its store count after acquiring parts of Rite Aid in 2018.Beyond store closures, Walgreens has been reviewing its US healthcare operations, including a potential sale of its VillageMD clinic business, which it had aggressively expanded. This move comes after the company’s shares lost nearly two-thirds of their value in 2023.Walgreens operates nearly 3,700 international stores in the UK, Mexico, Thailand, and Ireland. The buyout comes at a time of major shifts in the industry, with rival Rite Aid recently emerging from bankruptcy as a private company, while competitors like CVS, Walmart, and Kroger continue to dominate the US pharmacy market.","Walgreens Boots Alliance has been acquired by private equity firm Sycamore Partners in a deal worth nearly $10 billion.

A recent report showed plummeting sales in Europe, and the company faces increased competition from other EV makers eating away at its market share. Recent protests outside Tesla showrooms in the United States and some notable cases of vehicle owners being harassed have also made headlines.

Britain's finance minister, Rachel Reeves , has called for urgent reforms to the country's welfare system, citing concerns that it is ""costing too much"" as the nation grapples with high inflation and rising borrowing.Reeves is expected to announce significant cuts to welfare spending in her upcoming Spring Statement on March 26, following her inaugural budget in October.The government's fiscal position has been further strained by global challenges, including US tariffs and the ongoing war in Ukraine, leading to a depletion of the Labour administration's £9.9 billion ($12.7 billion) financial cushion, news agency AFP reported.In an interview on Sky News' Electoral Dysfunction podcast, Reeves said, ""We have to reform our welfare system because, right now, it's letting down taxpayers. It's costing too much and isn't effectively helping those it should.""She emphasized the need for a system that does more than provide benefits, aiming instead to support people back into employment. ""We need to get better value for money from taxpayers' contributions,"" she added.Any reforms could potentially conflict with the finance minister's self-imposed fiscal rules, which prevent borrowing for day-to-day spending. These rules are meant to maintain the credibility of the government's fiscal policies in financial markets.Meanwhile, Prime Minister Keir Starmer has pledged to increase UK defence spending to 2.5% of the national economy by 2027, a commitment spurred by growing concerns over the US's stance on Ukraine and NATO.","Britain's finance minister, Rachel Reeves, has called for urgent reforms to the country's welfare system.

The US market, which was already on the edge over US tariffs and economic uncertainty, suffered massive lows as the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 427 points (1 per cent) to 42,579.08, while the Nasdaq fell 483.48 points to 18,069.26, 2.6 per cent down at the end of the day.The S&P 500 index slid 1.8 per cent or 104.11 points to 5,738.52, resuming its recent downturn after a brief recovery spell the previous day.Stocks kept falling despite US President Donald Trump's decision to delay the 25 per cent tariff on Mexican, Canadian and Chinese imports for one month. Investors found little relief, though concerns persisted over whether Trump is using tariffs as a negotiation strategy or if an extended trade war is unavoidable.Despite hopes for a softer stance, Trump is still pressing ahead with additional tariffs set to take effect on 2nd April. The constant back-and-forth tariff imposition has also fuelled the market uncertainty as earlier.Yung-Yu Ma, chief investment officer at BMO Wealth Management said, “These exemptions don’t do much to resolve the general air of uncertainty.” He further added that businesses will continue to opt for a cautious stance in the current scenario until the tariff picture is clear.US firms are already struggling with the instability, while consumers brace for rising prices.All eyes are now on the US jobs report, a key indicator of economic health. So far, strong hiring and consumer spending have helped prevent a recession, and economists expected hiring to ramp up in February.However, some major retailers are flashing warning signs. Macy’s reported lower-than-expected revenue for the end of 2024, despite profits beating forecasts. It also issued a weaker profit outlook for 2025, sending its shares down 0.7 per cent.Victoria’s Secret followed a similar path, beating Q4 estimates but forecasting disappointing revenue for the year ahead, which caused its stock to plunge 8.2 per cent.Some of Wall Street's biggest tech firms are also falling.Chipmakers, which soared in recent years due to the artificial intelligence (AI) boom, also took a heavy hit. Marvell Technology fell almost 20 per cent despite recording better-than-expected earnings and predicting over 60 per cent revenue growth this quarter. Even Nvidia, the face of the AI revolution, fell 5.7 per cent, while Broadcom slid 6.3 per cent ahead of its earnings release.These firms are also facing increasing competition with Chinese companies ramping up their own AI development.European markets showed mixed results after the European Central Bank cut interest rates as expected. Germany’s DAX rose 1.5 per cent, while shares across Asia also gained, including a 3.3 per cent jump in Hong Kong and a 1.2 per cent rise in Shanghai.In the bond market, the 10-year US Treasury yield edged up slightly to 4.29 per cent from 4.28 per cent on Wednesday.","The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 427 points (1 per cent) to 42,579.08.

It will be kept as a store of value. The Reserve is like a digital Fort Knox for the cryptocurrency often called ‘digital gold,’”The order mandates a ‘full accounting’ of the government’s bitcoin holdings, which the czar claims were never properly audited. He also revealed that over the past 10 years, the country had sold almost 195,000 bitcoins for just $366 million, which would now be worth an estimated $17 billion, had they not been sold.Furthermore, the order also enabled the treasury and commerce departments to explore budget-neutral strategies to acquire more bitcoin.Trump’s stance towards digital gold has seen a drastic transition, as he once dismissed bitcoin as a ""scam,"" but has now positioned himself as the industry's strongest political ally. His administration has actively rolled back regulatory measures, and he has urged Congress to pass crypto-friendly legislation. On Friday, he is set to host industry leaders at the White House for a “Crypto Summit.”The order also created a separate “US Digital Asset Stockpile” for holding seized cryptocurrencies other than bitcoin. On Sunday, Trump caused a brief market spike after unexpectedly stating his interest in the government holding lesser-known cryptocurrencies such as XRP, Solana, and Cardano.Bitcoin, the world’s first and largest cryptocurrency, was created in response to the 2008 financial crisis by an anonymous developer or group known as Satoshi Nakamoto. While it has yet to become a mainstream payment method, its supply of 21 million coins has led many to consider it a safety net against inflation.

The Reserve is like a digital Fort Knox for the cryptocurrency often called ‘digital gold,’”The order mandates a ‘full accounting’ of the government’s bitcoin holdings, which the czar claims were never properly audited. He also revealed that over the past 10 years, the country had sold almost 195,000 bitcoins for just $366 million, which would now be worth an estimated $17 billion, had they not been sold.Furthermore, the order also enabled the treasury and commerce departments to explore budget-neutral strategies to acquire more bitcoin.Trump’s stance towards digital gold has seen a drastic transition, as he once dismissed bitcoin as a ""scam,"" but has now positioned himself as the industry's strongest political ally. His administration has actively rolled back regulatory measures, and he has urged Congress to pass crypto-friendly legislation. On Friday, he is set to host industry leaders at the White House for a “Crypto Summit.”The order also created a separate “US Digital Asset Stockpile” for holding seized cryptocurrencies other than bitcoin. On Sunday, Trump caused a brief market spike after unexpectedly stating his interest in the government holding lesser-known cryptocurrencies such as XRP, Solana, and Cardano.Bitcoin, the world’s first and largest cryptocurrency, was created in response to the 2008 financial crisis by an anonymous developer or group known as Satoshi Nakamoto. While it has yet to become a mainstream payment method, its supply of 21 million coins has led many to consider it a safety net against inflation. Some believe a strategic bitcoin reserve could even help pay off the US national debt in the future.Crypto markets soared after Trump’s election win, and when bitcoin first crossed $100,000, however, prices have since cooled.","After Trump's landmark order, Bitcoin's price plunged up to 5.7 percent.

The US trade deficit widened to a record in January as companies scrambled to secure goods from overseas before President Donald Trump imposed tariffs on America's largest trading partners.The gap in goods and services trade widened 34% from the prior month to $131.4 billion, commerce department data showed on Thursday. The value of imports rose 10% to a record $401.2 billion, while exports increased 1.2%. The figures aren't adjusted for inflation.Trump promised sweeping tariffs during the 2024 presidential campaign, and on Tuesday he handed down sweeping 25% duties on Canada and Mexico while doubling tariffs on Chinese goods to 20%. Canada and China immediately announced retaliatory measures, and Mexico is responding on Sunday.The Jan flurry of imports was broad and included a surge in inbound shipments of industrial supplies and materials. Within that category, imports of finished metal shapes that include gold bullion jumped $20.5 billion, marking a second month of steep increases.","Gap in goods and services trade widened 34% from the prior month to $131.4 billion.

MUMBAI: The US dollar may have run out of steam, with weaker economic data resulting in a decline in the dollar index. More weakness may be forthcoming as the announced tariffs will push up prices, reduce spending, and hit growth in the US.""The reversal of the dollar index in the last two-three weeks has been in parallel with the weakened data that has been coming up. When weaker data comes up, the view of what the Fed might do changes towards a more easing bias which in turn leads to less of a pressure on foreign exchange,"" said Satyam Panday, chief economist US & Canada at S&P. He was speaking at Crisil's India outlook event.According to Panday, the US outperformance narrative is probably not going to hold this year, going by the impact of tariffs. ""Without getting into the issue of reciprocal tariffs, the tariffs that have already been implemented - Canada, Mexico and the Chinese tariffs, back of the envelope calculation indicate a 60-70-basis-point price rise impact on the basket. If you look at the marginal propensity to consume you would probably see a 20-30 basis points impact on consumer spending .""According to D K Joshi, chief economist at Crisil, every time the rupee has fallen sharply from its trend rate of depreciation, it has been followed by an appreciation or a long period of stability.""Our forecast of the rupee-dollar exchange rate for March 2025 was at 87 and for March 2026, it was mild depreciation leading up to 88. I between I think there will be volatility but beyond that, this is our projection,"" said Joshi. ""We are going through the volatile phase right now, where you'll see ups and downs in currency. But if it depreciates too much it will also appreciate.""According to Joshi, the outflow of capital now has nothing to do with the interest rate differential but with uncertainty, because of which money was going back to its home market.","The US dollar may have run out of steam, with weaker economic data resulting in a decline in the dollar index.

"Trump wants India to lower tariffs on autos, but do Harley and Tesla really need them?",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/trump-wants-india-to-lower-tariffs-on-autos-but-do-harley-and-tesla-really-need-them/articleshow/118767003.cms,"US President Donald Trump (File Photo-AP)

NEW DELHI: Ironic as it may sound, but while US President Donald Trump pushes for lower import duty on Tesla cars and the iconic Harley-Davidson motorcycles when they come in to India, but neither of the two companies currently source them from America and rather prefer to get them from factories in other countries.While Harley is importing its bikes from its mega manufacturing set-up in Thailand, Tesla – which is close to launching its cars in India – will also not be shipping the electrics from the US, but rather from its factory in Germany (India has requested the company not to import from China).This, industry officials say, clearly brings out the fact that while there is noise and complaints from the new US administration regarding high duties on autos in India, American companies do not see the need to import fully-built products, or even semi- or completely-knocked down kits, from the US.Companies find it better and beneficial to use other manufacturing countries due to locational advantages (that saves freight as well as time when importing to India) or because of economies of scale.For example, look at the business case of Harley-Davidson motorcycles even after the govt decided to cut duty on imported bikes in the just-announced Union Budget. The Budget had slashed the customs duty on fully-built bikes bigger than 1600cc from 50% to 30%, while for SKD (semi-knocked down) kits, it came down from 25% to 20% and for CKD (completely-knocked down) from 15% to 10%. And for bikes with engines smaller than 1600cc, the customs duty was reduced from 50% to 40% for fully-built ones, while on SKDs from 25% to 20%, and on CKDs from 15% to 10%.Despite this, Harley – which makes only the 440cc model (called X440) in India in partnership with Hero Moto -- prefers to get the other models them from Thailand, instead of using its US factories. “There is a mega set-up in Thailand that the company uses to get its bikes to India. Beyond the 440cc that it makes here, all the other bikes – including bigger ones like Pan America, Nightster, Street Glide and Fat Bob -- are being imported from Thailand,” an analyst specializing in foreign trade told TOI.Interestingly, Harley imports its bikes to India at zero duty due to trade agreements between the two countries. “So even if India reduces the duty on imported bikes from the US to zero, Harley will still find it beneficial to get them from Thailand. This is because Thailand is closer to India and so the freight cost will be lower and products can reach faster,” another analyst said.","US President Donald Trump pushes for lower import duty on Tesla cars and the iconic Harley-Davidson motorcycles.

"European central bank cuts interest rates amid looming trade war, growth concern",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/european-central-bank-cuts-interest-rates-amid-looming-trade-war-growth-concern/articleshow/118765117.cms,"European Central Bank (Photo-AP)

The European central bank (ECB) reduced interest rates by 25 basis point on Thursday, aiming to stimulate economic activity as the eurozone grapples with sluggish growth.This move, which lowers borrowing costs for both consumers and businesses, comes amid mounting concerns about the impact of potential trade conflicts with the US and rising defence spending.The ECB’s decision to cut its benchmark deposit rate to 2.5% is aimed at supporting the economy by making it cheaper to borrow for investment and consumption. The bank previously raised rates to a record 4% in response to inflation peaking at 10.6% in October 2022, but has been easing rates since June as inflation has since moderated to 2.4%, according to AP report.Despite the decline in inflation, growth remains a pressing concern for the 20 nations using the euro. The eurozone’s economy showed zero growth in the final quarter of 2024, and the outlook for 2025 is uncertain due to shifting dynamics in global trade and the possibility of heightened defence spending.ECB President Christine Lagarde , speaking after the meeting, emphasized that the rate cut would make borrowing conditions “meaningfully less restrictive” for the economy.She cautioned that the central bank was not committing to a specific rate trajectory going forward, acknowledging the complexities presented by global trade tensions and increased government spending.As economic uncertainty continues, Lagarde noted that increased defence and infrastructure spending could spur growth, but growing global trade tensions—particularly with the US—pose a major challenge to inflation expectations in the eurozone.Economists, including Carsten Brzeski from ING Bank, pointed out that with increasing uncertainty and the possibility of large fiscal stimulus, the ECB’s future rate path is unclear. ""A pause at the next meeting to reassess the economic landscape seems likely,"" said Brzeski.The new fiscal realities in Germany, the eurozone’s largest economy, have added another layer of complexity. A new government coalition has agreed to loosen budget restrictions to allow for significantly more borrowing, potentially injecting up to a trillion euros into defence and other sectors over the next decade. This shift in fiscal policy could stimulate growth, but may also lead to increased inflationary pressures.Meanwhile, concerns are rising about US President Trump's potential new tariffs on European goods, which could further hinder growth in the export-driven eurozone economy . The looming trade war adds another layer of uncertainty for businesses already wary of inflation and political shifts.Despite these challenges, some analysts, like Julien Lafargue of Barclays Private Bank, expect the ECB to remain flexible, making future decisions based on incoming economic data. The central bank faces a delicate balancing act: boosting growth while managing inflationary risks, with external pressures such as US tariffs potentially complicating this task.","ECB reduced interest rates by 25 basis point on Thursday.

Trump tariffs: Is China really ready for a trade war with US?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/trump-tariffs-is-china-really-ready-for-a-trade-war-with-us/articleshow/118763757.cms,"Fight

Driving the news

""If war is what the US wants, be it a tariff war, a trade war or any other type of war, we’re ready to fight till the end.""

Why it matters

It isn’t just trade. The competing agendas of the leaders of the world’s two largest economies are poised to lead to precisely what China is trying to avoid: a superpower clash not seen since the Cold War, an all-encompassing rivalry over economic, technological and overall geopolitical supremacy. An article in the WSJ

China’s countermeasures

Is China really ready for a trade war against US?

What they’re saying

Trump’s trade advisers: “The US can no longer afford to let China dictate global trade rules. We are reclaiming our economic independence.”

Michael Pillsbury, China expert: “They are kind of desperate. Their economy is in trouble. Now that Trump put the tariffs on, they know this campaign [to avoid them] has failed.”

Chinese officials: “Xi believes that must be avoided,” said a person who consults Beijing, referring to the risk of Soviet-style isolation.

US defense secretary Pete Hegseth : “Those who long for peace must prepare for war. We are strengthening our military to deter China’s aggression.”

Trump’s strategy

Even though Trump may be the one who currently looks isolated on the world stage—picking trade fights with erstwhile allies like Mexico and Canada, alarming Europe over his handling of the war in Ukraine and vowing to annex Greenland and the Panama Canal—the truth is that China doesn’t hold a strong hand. An article in the WSJ

US leverage play

Trump is not stopping at tariffs. His administration is weighing additional measures to tighten restrictions on Chinese investment in the US, limit US companies’ business operations in China, and impose stricter export controls on high-tech goods.

Trump’s team also sees an opportunity to reshape global trade by striking deals with other nations before negotiating with China. The US has been in talks with Mexico, Vietnam, and India to strengthen trade relations and prevent China from using third countries as a backdoor into the US market.

The stakes extend beyond trade. Washington’s push to decouple key industries from China, restrict technology transfers, and rally partners against Beijing’s economic practices suggests a long-term strategy of containment. If successful, these moves could erode China’s ability to sustain high-growth levels, advance its technological ambitions, and project power internationally.

Between the lines

Trump’s trade war is as much about politics as it is about economics. He is betting that his tough stance on China will rally his base, reinforcing his image as a fighter against unfair trade practices.

For China, the challenge is existential. Xi Jinping is determined to avoid the fate of the Soviet Union, which collapsed under economic pressure from the US and its allies. That means China is likely to double down on efforts to insulate itself from US influence—whether through technological self-sufficiency, expanded trade partnerships, or military posturing.

The bottom line: The US-China trade war is entering a new, more intense phase. Trump believes he has the upper hand and is willing to let China “stew” in economic distress until it concedes to US demands, the WSJ report said.","The US-China trade war is entering a new, more intense phase.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"
E-commerce firm Udaan raises $340 million ahead of planned IPO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/e-commerce-firm-udaan-raises-340-million-ahead-of-planned-ipo/articleshow/105991030.cms,"Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain and boost vendor partnerships ahead of a stock market debut planned for 2025.The Series E round was done via a combination of fresh equity and conversion of debt, the Bangalore-based company said in a statement Thursday. The round was led by M&G Plc and existing investors including Lightspeed Venture Partners and DST Global participated.The round “fully funds our business plan,” Vaibhav Gupta, Udaan co-founder and chief executive officer, said in the statement. “It enables our continued journey of growth and profitability, positioning us well to be public-market ready in the next 12-18 months.”Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, runs an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business, though a very small part of India’s overall retail market, is expected to swell to $150 billion in sales in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co.The startup targets an initial public offering in 2025, though it’s yet to decide whether it will do so in India or overseas, Gupta told Bloomberg News last month.Udaan was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran the company until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021.

The Series A funding round was led by Lightspeed Venture Partners , and participants included Silicon Valley billionaire Vinod Khosla’s Khosla Ventures and Peak XV Partners , formerly Sequoia Capital India & Southeast Asia, Sarvam said Thursday.The Bangalore-based startup, until recently in stealth mode, was co-founded by Vivek Raghavan and Pratyush Kumar. It has ambitious plans to build open source foundational AI systems as well as tools for creating apps for the meager compute infrastructure available to developers in India. The startup has a total of 18 employees and is just opening an office in the city.""What we are showing is that you can build large language models with limited resources,” Raghavan said in a phone interview. ""We are building at a smaller scale and demonstrating that these can be extremely cost and energy efficient so they can be accessed by everyone.""Large language models, like OpenAI’s GPT-4 and Meta Platforms Inc.’s Llama, are powerful AI systems that understand by learning from vast amounts of diverse data from the internet and elsewhere to summarize, translate, and create text, audio and video for a wide range of applications.

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Startups will play an important role in helping India become the third largest economy in the world, Chief Economic Advisor ( CEA ) to the Union government V Anantha Nageswaran has said.Nageswaran said that tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country due to improvements in infrastructure and supportive policies of the government, according to a KSUM release.The CEA, during his Leadership Talk on the concluding day of the Huddle Global 2023 organised by the Kerala Startup Mission (KSUM), said that India was the fifth largest economy on course to become the third largest in a few years.""In fact, I will say 7-in-7 is the buzz slogan, that is 7 trillion USD economy in seven years. Seven trillion USD economy size by 2030 is possible if India maintains its present growth trajectory, and in that journey startup entrepreneurs are going to play an important role,"" he is quoted as having said in the release.He was of the view that the active participation of startups in India in developing business models on the foundation of expanding physical and digital infrastructure will continue to generate efficiency, revenue and economic returns for the country.""The last decade has seen an exceptional transformation in the startup landscape in India, which has emerged as the third largest ecosystem globally, with over 1.12 lakh startups presently recognised by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) across 763 districts.""Among them, more than 110 are unicorns with a total valuation of around USD 350 billion,"" he said.The CEA further said that the country ranks second in innovation quality.He said that innovation in India was not just limited to certain sectors as startups were solving problems in 56 industrial sectors, with 13 per cent of them from IT services, nine per cent from health and life sciences, seven per cent from education, five per cent from agriculture and five per cent from food and beverages.Nageswaran also said it was significant that 49 per cent of the startups were from tier-2 and 3 cities which have turned to be game-changers as the business advantages in these locations enable entrepreneurs to operate at lower costs as compared to tier-1 cities.""Apart from improved infrastructure and the government's pro-active policies, the availability of a technically skilled talent pool is a huge advantage for startups to set up and flourish in tier-2 and tier-3 cities,"" he said.He said that historically there was a perception that small towns were difficult places to conduct business.""...but with improved internet penetration, vastly better physical infrastructure, road, rail and air connectivity and supportive government policies, this is no longer true,"" he said.He also noted Kerala's startup journey has been an inspiring one.The CEA said that KSUM has served as the catalyst since its establishment in 2006 to promote change that propelled the state into the forefront of the global startup arena.KSUM is the Kerala government's nodal agency established in 2006 for entrepreneurship development and incubation activities in the state.Nageswaran said that with over 4,000 registered tech startups, 63 incubators and 10 lakh square feet of incubation space, KSUM has not only met its goal of promoting technology-based entrepreneurship but has also earned the distinguished position of being among the world's top business incubators.The November 16-18 fifth edition of Huddle Global, India's biggest beachside startup conclave, was organised by KSUM at Adimalathura beach, near Vizhinjam, here.Attended by around 1,500 delegates, the event displayed sophisticated products from emerging sectors such as robotics, Artificial Intelligence , Machine Learning, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, life sciences, space tech, blockchain, IoT, e-governance, fintech, healthtech, agritech, edutech and SaaS from across the country.","Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran said tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country.

E-Commerce startup Udaan to trim costs ahead of 2025 IPO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/e-commerce-startup-udaan-to-trim-costs-ahead-of-2025-ipo/articleshow/105001132.cms,"E-commerce startup Udaan is working to curb costs and forge new partnerships with consumer brands in India as it prepares to go public in 2025.Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta said in an interview. That’s set to happen around the same time as its initial public offering, he said.The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said. “Second, strategically we want to ensure that we are top of mind with shopkeepers, with big manufacturers, and we maintain our relative market share.”Lightspeed Venture Partners-backed Udaan is among startups trying to tap the rapid growth of India’s economy and consumer market, while meeting investor demands for profitability. Udaan, which at its peak employed thousands, joined fellow Indian startups in slashing jobs last year and tightening internal controls and compliance. It now has about 1,800 staff, and Gupta didn’t specify if further job cuts are needed.Corporate governance lapses at Indian online tutoring firm Byju’s, once the country’s top startup with a valuation of $22 billion, shone a light at unique challenges faced by founders in the South Asian nation and drove companies to be more diligent.“We continue to move towards more professionalized management, professionalized board and also institutionalized shareholders as we go towards public markets,” Gupta said.Udaan is yet to decide whether it will list in India or overseas. It was valued at more than $3 billion in a 2021 funding round, and was in talks to raise $400 million, Business Standard reported in September. Lightspeed owns about 35% of Udaan, while Tencent Holdings Ltd. holds 6%.The company was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart.

That business is profitable before taxes and is growing 70% annually, Gupta said.“That’s a second business in the overall umbrella of Udaan trying to organize trade in the country,” Gupta said. “In addition to commerce, financing becomes an important market opportunity.”","Udaan will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta says.

Stock market recommendations:Benchmark indices remained range-bound last week, following a robust bullish rally in the preceding sessions. Global investors stayed on the sidelines, tracking developments on US–China and US–India trade negotiations. The US Federal Reserve, in its latest FOMC policy meeting, delivered a second consecutive rate cut, bringing the federal funds rate down to 3.75–4.00%, marking the lowest level in three years. However, Chair Jerome Powell’s neutral stance on the future monetary policy trajectory prompted profit-taking at higher levels on Thursday, leading to mild consolidation across key indices.Over the past six trading sessions, the Nifty has exhibited a sideways consolidation pattern, moving within a well-defined range of 25,700–26,100, broadly in line with expectations following the recent rally. This phase of time-wise correction suggests that the market is currently in a pause mode, digesting prior gains before the next directional move.From a technical perspective, sustained trade above the upper band of 26,100 could act as a trigger for bullish momentum, potentially propelling the index towards its previous all-time high of 26,277. A decisive breakout beyond this level may open the door for a further upside towards 26,500 in the near term, supported by improving market breadth and positive sectoral rotationThe broader market trajectory continues to exhibit a bullish bias, reaffirming that the primary uptrend remains firmly in place.The ongoing phase of consolidation is best interpreted as a healthy retracement and time correction following a sharp 1,500-point up move over the past four weeks.This constructive consolidation provides market participants with an opportune window to initiate fresh long positions and accumulate high-quality, fundamentally sound counters through a staggered accumulation strategy, thereby optimizing entry levels. In essence, the market appears to be undergoing a technical breather within an ongoing bullish structure, setting the stage for the next leg of the upward momentum once the consolidation base is firmly established.Strong support is seen around 25,700–25,500, which is likely to hold as it is the confluence of the recent breakout zone. The 20 days EMA is also placed around 25580 and the 38.2% retracement of the previous up move (24587-26104)Bank Nifty continues to maintain a bullish structure on the daily and weekly chart, forming a series of higher highs and higher lows in all time frames.Going ahead, a decisive move above last week’s high of 58,577 would confirm a breakout continuation, paving the way for a rally towards 59,000 and 59,300, which correspond to the 138.2% Fibonacci projection of the recent correction (57,628–53,561). However, failure to clear this level may result in range-bound movement between 58,600 and 57,300 in the near term.On the downside, immediate support is seen around 57,300–57,500, aligning with the previous breakout zone, while a stronger support base lies near 56,800–56,500.Overall, the outlook remains positive, and any pullbacks should be viewed as buying opportunities within these support areas.The stock has broken out above the falling trendline connecting the June 2025 and September 2025 highs, signaling strength and offering a fresh entry opportunity. The price action is forming a higher high–higher low structure on the daily timeframe, reinforcing the bullish outlook.We anticipate the stock to move higher towards the 129 level, which aligns with the June 2025 high and the 123.6% Fibonacci extension of the prior upswing from 98 to 117, projected from the recent low at 105.From a technical indicator perspective, the RSI remains in a bullish configuration and has recently triggered a buy signal, suggesting continued upward momentum.The stock is displaying a sustained bullish structure, forming consecutive higher highs and higher lows on the weekly chart. It has also broken out of a prolonged base formation, accompanied by a decisive breach of its falling trendline resistance — signaling a transition from a consolidation phase to a fresh uptrend.A clear breakout from the descending triangle pattern has already occurred thus opening upwards towards 62 in the medium term being measured move projection derived from the descending triangle breakout.On the indicator front, the weekly RSI is exhibiting a steady upward trajectory, reflecting sustained strength in momentum. There are no visible signs of exhaustion or bearish divergence, suggesting that the prevailing bullish momentum remains intact without indications of a trend reversal.","According to Bajaj Broking Research, the top stock picks for October 31, 2025 are NBCC, and Sagility.

Pak Minister Khawaja Asif Accuses Afghanistan Acting Under India’s Influence, Issues Brutal Warning

Importance of Chabahar port for India





In a boost for India’s regional connectivity plans especially with regard to Afghanistan, the Donald Trump administration has granted extension of sanctions waiver on Iran’s Chabahar port According to an ET report, India has managed to get an extension for the sanctions waiver until early next year on the Chabahar Port. This port plays a vital role in India’s regional connectivity strategy by providing access to Afghanistan and Central Asia-Eastern Russia.Following the expiry of the US sanctions waiver on Tuesday, India successfully negotiated an extension until early next year, sources told ET. During extensive discussions, India emphasised the necessity of maintaining the Chabahar Port's operations as an essential component of its regional connectivity initiatives.Earlier reports had confirmed that New Delhi was working towards obtaining an extension of the sanctions waiver, with the matter under review. India had received a US sanctions waiver for the port until October 28, following an initial deadline of September 29 for the waiver's revocation.On May 13, 2024, India entered into a decade-long agreement to operate the Chabahar port. The contract was finalised between Indian Ports Global Limited and Iran's Port & Maritime Organisation.The Chabahar Port plays a vital role in strengthening India-Afghanistan economic relations and delivering humanitarian assistance, including ambulances that India provided during the Afghan foreign minister's recent visit.The Taliban administration shows strong interest in utilising the Chabahar Port for international connections.Plans are underway to link Chabahar Port with the International North-South Transport Corridor and Central Asian nations. Sources told the financial daily that India's Central Asian ally Uzbekistan, following a multipolar approach, seeks alternatives to China's Belt and Road Initiative for connectivity in Eurasia and anticipates India's involvement in addressing Chabahar Port matters.Notably, Uzbekistan holds the distinction of being one of only two doubly landlocked countries globally, alongside Liechtenstein.Reports suggest that Russia intends to access the Chabahar Port through Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan to facilitate trade with India and other Asian regions.","On May 13, 2024, India entered into a decade-long agreement to operate the Chabahar port.

8th Pay Commission: Top things to know about Cabinet decision





In a big cheer for central government employees, PM Narendra Modi-led Union Cabinet on Tuesday approved the Terms of Reference for the 8th Central Pay Commission.The 8th Central Pay Commission’s proposals will raise the salaries of approximately 50 lakh central government staff members and pensions of 69 lakh retired personnel.In January 2025, the Government announced the formation of the 8th Central Pay Commission to review and propose revisions to the salaries and benefits of Central Government employees.Also Read | 8th Pay Commission: How much salary & pension hike should central government employees, pensioners expect? Top things to know According to the Cabinet release, the 8th Central Pay Commission Commission will function as a temporary entity, consisting of a Chairperson, one Part-Time Member, and one Member-Secretary. Its recommendations are due within 18 months of its establishment, with the possibility of submitting interim reports when specific recommendations are finalised.The 8th Pay Commission, led by former Supreme Court justice Ranjana Prakash Desai, will deliver a preliminary report to the government.Professor Pulak Ghosh from IIM Bangalore has been appointed as a part-time commissioner, whilst Petroleum Secretary Pankaj Jain will serve as the Member Secretary.When questioned about the implementation timing of the 8th Pay Commission's recommendations, I&B Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said, ""The specific date will be decided once the interim report comes in... But, mostly it should be January 1, 2026.""The 8th Central Pay Commission's deliberations will consider:i. The economic conditions in the country and the need for fiscal prudence;ii. The need to ensure that adequate resources are available for developmental expenditure and welfare measures;iii. The unfunded cost of non-contributory pension schemes;iv. The likely impact of the recommendations on the finances of the State Governments which usually adopt the recommendations with some modifications; andv. The prevailing emolument structure, benefits and working conditions available to employees of Central Public Sector Undertakings and private sector.Terms of Reference (TOR) serves as a framework document for a pay commission, establishing guidelines and parameters for preparing its report. It includes essential definitions, terms and conditions that guide the commission's work.The Terms of Reference is drafted by a Joint Consultative Machinery (JCM), with final approval from the Cabinet Committee under the Finance Ministry. The JCM includes union representatives from various ministries. From its 60 members, 12 are chosen for the standing committee. These selected members engage in discussions about TOR subjects with secretary-level government officials. The finalised TOR is then submitted for Cabinet approval.The significance of TOR lies in its function as a main reference document when a pay commission develops its recommendations.According to a TOI report, the government has kept the terms of reference undisclosed, yet the committee's primary responsibility involves examining the financial implications of non-contributory pension programmes.The central government's decision to transition from the National Pension System to Unified Pension Scheme for pre-2004 recruits lacks clarity on pension payment obligations.This absence of estimated liabilities has resulted in no budgetary allocations. Additionally, any increase in employee remuneration and benefits will inevitably lead to enhanced pension commitments.Central Pay Commissions are established periodically to evaluate and recommend changes to emoluments, retirement benefits and service conditions for Central Government employees.These recommendations are typically implemented on a ten-year cycle. Following this pattern, the 8th Central Pay Commission's recommendations would take effect from January 1, 2026.The 7th Pay Commission was established in February 2014, with its proposals taking effect from January 1, 2016.Central government staff receive dearness allowance (DA) to offset inflation's impact on their actual salary value. This DA rate undergoes regular revision every six months, with adjustments linked to inflation levels.","The 8th Central Pay Commission’s proposals will raise the salaries of approximately 50 lakh central government staff members and pensions of 69 lakh retired personnel.

TOKYO: After being on the fringes for years, Japan’s Honda is charting an aggressive comeback with the launch of as many as ten new cars, including seven SUVs.Honda Motor Co president and CEO Toshihiro Mibe is pivoting the automaker’s global strategy towards India, announcing a dedicated project team, a renewed EV and hybrid plan, and the new models by 2030. The move marks Honda’s bid to regain lost ground in one of the world’s fastest-growing auto markets.At a media interaction following the Japan Mobility Show, Mibe said India would now stand alongside North America and Japan as one of Honda’s three key growth pillars. “The global auto market has been changing, and market shares of different companies are shifting drastically,” he said. “Especially because of the Chinese OEMs who are encroaching more into the world market. Honda, of course, is impacted by this trend in China and other Asian markets. However, our growth markets remain North America, Japan, and India. India is a priority market where we intend to concentrate more efforts going forward.”Honda, like several global automakers, has struggled with trade-related uncertainty in the US and competitive pressure from Chinese EV makers. Mibe said Honda had set up a project team dedicated to India to frame its EV and electrification roadmap.“The team is exploring approaches suitable for India, including collaboration opportunities with the two-wheeler segment,” he said. “With many suppliers and OEMs in India, alliances could maximize our opportunities. ”Honda plans ten or more model launches by 2030, covering both mass and premium segments. “For SUVs, which have become mainstream in India, we plan seven models by 2030,” Mibe said. The lineup will include models from Honda’s new Zero Series EV family, previewed at the Japan Mobility Show. The Zero Series Alpha, built at the Tapukara plant that produces the City, Amaze, and Elevate, will also be exported to Japan and other Asian markets.

BENGALURU: India has the depth and savings to create its own pool of patient capital, commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal said on Friday, and called for greater use of domestic funds to accelerate the next phase of growth in the country’s startup ecosystem.“I asked my team to look at the regulatory framework so that long-term domestic funds—like pension and insurance—can participate in venture investments. We should not be overly dependent on foreign venture capital. India has the depth and savings to create its own pool of patient capital. The next decade will be about patient capital—investors who believe in India’s structural growth rather than chasing short-term returns,” he said at the eleventh edition of the ET Startup Awards 2025 held in Bengaluru on Friday.Goyal also emphasised the need for family offices to create larger pools of capital for startups and ensure that funds reach entrepreneurs even in smaller towns across India to strengthen the startup ecosystem. When asked about the FDI slowdown and whether the govt would revisit some norms to boost investments into India, Goyal said there is no slowdown, adding that recent figures show a significant uptick in FDI inflows.India, he said, continues to attract strong FDI inflows despite global uncertainties, with the world viewing the country as a “trusted partner and a stable investment destination.”He said investors appreciate India’s consistency in policy and the clarity of the economic direction . “We don’t make knee-jerk changes; we believe in stability and predictability,” Goyal said, adding that many global companies, now see India “not just as a market but as a manufacturing and innovation hub” and want to be part of the India growth story.Goyal also said India is in the final lap of negotiations with the US on the trade deal. “Wherever we get a good deal, a fair deal, an equitable deal, India will be ready to put a signature.

Trump’s relations with CBS





Going downhill

Settling the feud

A new chapter





Months after US President Donald Trump settled a $16 million lawsuit with CBS News, he is set to return to “60 Minutes” this Sunday, marking his first appearance on the programme since the dispute.CBS confirmed that Norah O’Donnell conducted the interview at Mar-a-Lago on Friday. The network has, however, not disclosed how this week’s interview was arranged, nor whether any terms were set in advance.Although O’Donnell, although is a former “CBS Evening News” anchor, she is not among the regular correspondents of “60 Minutes”.The interview will be aired this Sunday, according to AP.The president's relationship with the network and with the long-running newsmagazine, has been turbulent.Back in run-up to the 2020 election, Trump abruptly ended an interview with correspondent Lesley Stahl, accusing the show of bias, and later his team released an unedited transcript.Despite repeated overtures from the programme, he did not sit for an interview during the 2024 campaign. Trump would later accuse “60 Minutes” of editing its interview with Kamala Harris “deceptively” to present her more favourably.Though CBS News denied the claim, maintaining that the Harris interview was edited according to routine editorial standards, Trump responded with legal action. He demanded the network $10 billion in damages but then raised the demand to $20 billion.Although legal experts largely dismissed Trump’s lawsuit as meritless and unlikely to stand because of constitutional press protections, Paramount chose to pursue mediation instead, a move made as the company was working to close its $8 billion merger with Skydance.The matter was resolved when Paramount, the network’s parent company, paid Trump $16 million, back in July, to settle the case. The payment came weeks before the Federal Communications Commission approved Paramount’s merger with Skydance Media, led by new CEO David Ellison.The lawsuit had internal consequences at CBS. Bill Owens, the executive producer of “60 Minutes”, stepped down in the spring, saying he could no longer run the programme independently. This was followed by the resignation of CBS News chief executive Wendy McMahon in May.Although Paramount did not apologise or acknowledge any fault, the company agreed as part of the settlement to release transcripts of future “60 Minutes” interviews with presidential candidates.Trump has been signalling improved relations with the broadcaster, since David Ellison assumed control at Paramount this summer. Ellison is the son of Larry Ellison, a prominent Trump supporter.Under his leadership, the company hired Kenneth Weinstein, the former head of a conservative think tank and a donor to Trump’s 2024 campaign, to review complaints alleging bias in the network’s journalism.During a flight home from the Middle East on October 12, Trump supported Ellisons’ role in the reshaped media landscape. “Larry Ellison is great, and his son David is great. They're friends of mine. They're big supporters of mine, and they'll do the right thing,” he told reporters.Paramount has also expanded its footprint in political and opinion media. In October, the company purchased the Free Press website and appointed its founder, Bari Weiss, as editor-in-chief of CBS News.Weiss is reported to have helped secure a recent “60 Minutes” segment featuring Jared Kushner and Trump associate Steve Witkoff discussing the Gaza peace deal.",US President Donald Trump set to return to '60 Minutes' this Sunday. It will be his first appearance on the programme since he settled a $16 million lawsuit with CBS News.

Sebi probes MCX’s over 4-hour trading disruption on October 28,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/sebi-probes-mcxs-over-4-hour-trading-disruption-on-october-28/articleshow/125008327.cms,"Exchange May Face Monetary Penalty If Systems Found At Fault





MUMBAI: Markets regulator Sebi is investigating the four-and-half-hour trading disruption on MCX, the biggest commodities derivatives exchange in India, on October 28 that delayed the start of operations. If it finds faults with the exchange’s systems, MCX could face a monetary penalty.“Sebi has started an investigation into the same (trading halt on MCX),” a source said. Sebi rules specify that for stoppage of trading on an exchange for more than 45 minutes, the bourse can be slapped with ‘financial disincentives’, the new term for monetary penalty under regulator rules. Such financial disincentives could rise up to 20% of MCX’s average profit of the last two years.An email sent to the regulator remained unanswered till late on Friday. As a matter of policy, Sebi doesn’t comment on ongoing investigations relating to a regulated entity. MCX didn’t respond to TOI’s request for comment on the matter.A report by Reuters earlier Friday said that the regulator was looking into the whole incident of trading halt at MCX and was likely to penalise the exchange for the same. On Friday, MCX said in a release that it had identified the root cause of the problem that related to “parameter limit relating to reference data like Unique Client Code (UCC) configured within the systems.This led to constraints beyond the threshold. ”This means a pre-assigned number was assigned to how many UCCs MCX’s system was permitted to handle. And on the day of the tech glitch the number of UCCs that were sent to the bourse’s system were more than the pre-set limit. This in turn led to delay in the start of trading at 1.25pm against the normal start at 9am.“We have taken steps to address the constraints to prevent similar issues in the future. Notably, trading systems have not had issues. Exchange systems are well positioned to support market volumes and growth,” the release from MCX said.Sebi’s rules relating to trading halt due to tech glitch on an exchange or any other market infrastructure institution (MII), issued in July 2021, say that after such incidents the MMI should send in a preliminary report to the regulator within 24 hours and a root-cause analysis within 21 days.Sebi rules also demand that if a trading halt extends for more than 45 minutes, the MII would face a financial disincentive of 10% of its average profit of the previous two years or Rs 2 crore, whichever is higher.","Market regulator Sebi is investigating the four-and-half-hour trading disruption on MCX.

No ban on weekly F&O contracts: Sebi chairman,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/no-ban-on-weekly-fo-contracts-sebi-chairman/articleshow/125008262.cms,"



MUMBAI: Markets regulator Sebi will not ban weekly derivatives contracts that have emerged as one of the most traded contracts in the country but will bring in changes to the futures & options (F&O) segment in a calibrated manner, Sebi chairman Tuhin Kanta Pandey reiterated his stand on the issue on Friday.Over the last few years retail investors have taken to trading weekly options contracts more than any other F&O contracts, raising concerns among regulators, policy makers and the govt that these instruments are being used more for speculation than for any productive purpose. As a result, the regulator has limited only one weekly contract per exchange.“We cannot just shut down weekly F&O expiries. Many market participants are actively using it,” Pandey said at an event in the city.The Sebi chief said that the regulator was now gathering and analysing a large amount of data on trading patterns in the F&O segment, and the same will be released in the form of a consultation before moving forward. He also said that Sebi had already implemented some measures in the derivatives sector, some of which have not yet gone into effect.Speaking about risk management and market integrity in the F&O space, Pandey said that Sebi had prescribed a range of measures “to strengthen the equity derivatives framework. These measures were taken to address the heightened market activity on expiry day and to manage the risk better, ensuring that foundation of market operations remains strong even in times of stress.”",Sebi chairman Tuhin Kanta Pandey reiterated his stand on the issue on Friday.

NEW DELHI: Cyclone Montha, brewing over the Arabian Sea, is expected to intensify into a severe cyclonic storm and make landfall along the Andhra Pradesh coast between Machilipatnam and Kalingapatnam, near Kakinada, by Tuesday evening, according to the India Meteorological Department (IMD).The name Montha meaning “beautiful” or “fragrant flower” was suggested by Thailand, one of the 13 member countries of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) and UN ESCAP panel that governs cyclone naming in the North Indian Ocean region. Each name is used only once and never repeated.In the North Indian Ocean, which includes the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea, cyclone naming is managed by the WMO/ESCAP Panel on Tropical Cyclones. This panel includes 13 countries: India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Myanmar, Maldives, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Oman, Yemen, Iran, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates.Each member submits a list of names that reflect their culture, language, or natural environment. The names are then used sequentially whenever a new cyclone reaches the intensity required to be officially named by the India Meteorological Department (IMD), which acts as the Regional Specialized Meteorological Centre (RSMC) for this region.Each country has submitted 13 names, forming a list of 169 names used sequentially and alphabetically. Names are neutral to gender, politics, and religion. The first cyclone of this season, Shakhti, suggested by Sri Lanka, formed earlier this month in the Arabian Sea but spared the Indian coast.The cyclone is likely to bring heavy rain across Andhra Pradesh, Odisha and Tamil Nadu with red alerts issued for several coastal districts of Andhra Pradesh.After Montha, the next cyclones will be named Senyar (UAE), Ditwah (Yemen), Arnab (Bangladesh), and Murasu (India). The naming system began in 2004, following a decision by the WMO and ESCAP in 2000, to make communication about tropical storms simpler and more effective for public awareness and disaster management.","Cyclone Montha, brewing over the Arabian Sea, is expected to intensify into a severe cyclonic storm by October 28.

American investment company BlackRock reported to have fallen prey to a multi-million-dollar 'breathtaking' fraud allegedly orchestrated by Bankim Brahmbhatt, the Indian-origin CEO of a US-based telecom company, Broadband Telecom and Bridgevoice. The Wall Street Journal reported that lenders have accused Brahmbhatt's company of fabricating accounts receivable that were supposed to be used as loan collateral and now the CEO's companies owe them more than $500 million. Brahmbhatt's lawyer told Journal that the CEO disputed the fraud allegations.HPS, the private credit card investment arm of BlackRock, began lending to at least one financing arm affiliated with Brahmbhatt’s telecom companies in September 2020. HPS increased the size of its debt investment to around $385 million in early 2021, and then to about $430 million in August 2024.In July, an HPS employee noticed irregularities with certain email addresses as they looked like they came from fake domains mimicking real telecom companies. HPS officials raised concerns with Brahmbhatt but he assured them that there was nothing to worry about and then he stopped answering their phone calls.An HPS official visited the NY offices of Brahmbhatt's companies and found them closed. Brahmbhatt's telecom companies filed for bankruptcy in August.l visited Brahmbhatt's Garden City house, listed as his residence, but no one answered. ""Two BMWs, a Porsche, a Tesla and an Audi were parked in the driveway. A package next to the front door was collecting dust,"" the report said. HPS told some clients that they believed Brahmbhatt is in India. ""Calls to Brahmbhatt’s lawyer seeking comment on his client’s whereabouts weren’t immediately returned,"" the report said.The lenders filed suit in August and alleged that they had investigated the customer emails Brahmbhatt-owned companies had provided to verify invoices over the past two years and each of those was fake. “Brahmbhatt created an elaborate balance sheet of assets that existed only on paper,” lawyers for the lenders wrote. The lenders further allege that Brahmbhatt had transferred assets that should have been pledged as collateral to offshore accounts in India and Mauritius, according to their lawsuit.","Investment company BlackRock reported to have fallen prey to a multi-million- dollar 'breathtaking' fraud.

Amazon’s stellar quarterly results helped Wall Street stay near record highs on Friday, with the S&P 500 hovering around its all-time peak set earlier in the week, capping what could be its sixth straight monthly gain — the longest winning streak since 2021.The S&P 500 was virtually flat after paring morning gains, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 102 points, or less than 0.2%. The Nasdaq composite edged up 0.4%, buoyed by Big Tech earnings, AP reported.Amazon shares jumped 10.3%, emerging as the strongest driver of market gains after the company posted a quarterly profit that far exceeded analysts’ expectations. CEO Andy Jassy said growth in its cloud-computing unit has “reaccelerated back to a pace it hasn’t seen since 2022.”Given Amazon’s massive $2.4 trillion valuation, its stock movement significantly influences the S&P 500. Apple, the world’s largest company by market capitalisation at over $4 trillion, traded between modest gains and losses, last up 0.1%. It also reported stronger-than-expected profits, with CEO Tim Cook crediting robust iPhone and services revenue for the beat.Elsewhere, Reddit jumped 12.1% after reporting higher profit and revenue than analysts projected, while Coinbase Global rose 6.8% on better-than-expected earnings.Netflix climbed 3.3% after announcing a 10-for-1 stock split to make shares more affordable without altering investor holdings.These gains helped offset a 4.8% slide in AbbVie, whose quarterly results, though above expectations, fell short of the strong beats investors had become accustomed to. Analysts noted expectations were high after the drugmaker’s stock surged 28.4% this year.Market analysts said investor focus remains on whether corporate earnings growth can justify elevated stock valuations. The S&P 500 had dropped 1% on Thursday as concerns grew over soaring capital expenditure plans by Meta Platforms and Microsoft amid the AI investment race.Adding to the cautious tone, financial markets showed scepticism that President Donald Trump’s trade truce with China would fully ease tensions. Microsoft and Meta fell further on Friday, down 1.6% and 2.2% respectively, dragging the broader market.In overseas markets, European indices slipped following a mixed Asian session. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng fell 1.4% and Shanghai’s Composite dropped 0.8% after data showed China’s factory activity contracted for a seventh consecutive month — its fastest decline in six months. Japan’s Nikkei 225 bucked the trend, rising 2.1% to a record high after September industrial output exceeded forecasts.In the bond market, US Treasury yields eased slightly after a midweek spike triggered by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s caution that another interest rate cut in December “is not a foregone conclusion — far from it.” The 10-year yield dipped to 4.09% from 4.11% but remained above Monday’s 3.99%.According to Bank of America’s Global Research report, several central banks have paused rate cuts or hinted at doing so, suggesting “this is it for the 2025 easing season in developed economies.”","The S&P 500 was virtually flat after paring morning gains, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 102 points, or less than 0.2%.

Soybean trade between the US and China is set to resume after months of halted purchases. Beijing had refused to purchase American soybean after the two nations got embroiled in tariff tensions.Now, China has agreed to buy 12 million metric tonnes from the United States in the ongoing season till January. However, this is still significantly lower than the 22.5 million tonnes purchased in the previous season.US treasury secretary Scott Bessent confirmed the development on Thursday, saying China has also committed to purchasing 25 million tonnes annually over the next three years under a broader trade agreement. The commitment was reached following talks between US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping in South Korea.The decline in Chinese purchases came as a hit for the US farmers who lost billions in sales. The deal would, hence, come as a return to normalcy with the top US soybean importer. Over the past five crop years, China’s annual purchases averaged 28.8 million tonnes from September to August, Reuters reported.“Our great soybean farmers, who the Chinese used as political pawns - that's off the table, and they should prosper in the years to come,” Bessent said on Fox Business Network's Mornings with Maria. He further added that the agreement negotiated in Malaysia over the weekend could be formally signed as early as next week.Alongside China’s commitments, Bessent said other Southeast Asian countries have agreed to buy an additional 19 million tonnes of US soybeans, though he did not specify the timeframe or which countries are involved. According to US Census Bureau data, other Asian importers typically purchase between 8 and 10 million tonnes annually.The commodity markets responded immediately. The most-active soybean contract on the Chicago Board of Trade erased earlier losses and finished 1.2% higher, settling at a 15-month peak of $11.07-3/4 per bushel. Export prices for US soybeans have surged by $20 to $30 per metric tonne this week, driven by expectations of renewed Chinese demand after the Trump–Xi meeting. Roughly 180,000 tonnes, three cargoes, were sold to state trader COFCO just before the summit.Farm groups have welcomed the breakthrough after the prolonged trade war slashed soy exports that were worth $24.5 billion last year. US farmers are nearing completion of what is expected to be the fifth-largest soybean harvest on record, but weak Chinese demand and rising costs for fertiliser, seed, labour and machinery have squeezed farm incomes.“This is a meaningful step forward to reestablishing a stable, long-term trading relationship that delivers results for farm families and future generations,” American Soybean Association President and Kentucky farmer Caleb Ragland told Reuters.The breakthrough comes after Trump secured agricultural trade understandings with other Asian economies. American Farm Bureau Federation President Zippy Duvall said, “Expanding markets and restoring purchases by China will provide some certainty for farmers who are struggling just to hold on.”Trump announced on social media after the meeting with Xi that China had authorised purchases of “massive amounts” of soybeans, sorghum and other US farm products. US Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins later praised Trump’s comment in a post on X.However, analysts say the arrangement largely resets the trade relationship to previous levels rather than marking an expansion. Even Rogers Pay, director at Beijing-based Trivium China, said the agreement “effectively constituted a return to business as usual”, adding, “It targets a level of trade that has been pretty consistent with the past few years.”Further details will determine whether private Chinese importers return to the US market. Johnny Xiang, founder of Beijing-based AgRadar Consulting, said commercial buyers are waiting to see if soybean tariffs will be lowered from 20% to 10%, or removed entirely.“If the tariff is not completely lifted, commercial buyers will have little incentive to purchase US soybeans,” he told Reuters.China, the world’s largest soybean importer, used its massive demand as leverage during the earlier Trump-era trade war. Facing tariffs of 23%, Chinese buyers shifted towards South American suppliers. Since then, China has intentionally diversified its import sources. Customs data shows that in 2024, only 20% of China’s soybean imports came from the United States, a steep drop from 41% in 2016.","Soybean trade between the US and China is set to resume after months of halted purchases.

Is America running out of pennies? Trump’s cost-cutting plan leaves retailers counting losses; what it means,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/america-runs-out-of-pennies-trumps-common-cents-plan-to-save-cashretailers-left-counting-losses/articleshow/124980444.cms,"'Trump Using Hunger For Bargain': Shockwaves In U.S. Over SNAP Cuts As Shutdown Explodes

'Wanted it to go—but not like this!'

High cost, less worth—Pennies go away

Common Cents Act

How is it impacting government and retailers





America is running out of pennies, quite literally!The US is facing a nationwide shortage of pennies, months after President Donald Trump halted production of the one-cent coin without introducing a transition plan.The decision, which came as a cost-saving measure, is now impacting the country’s commerce. In many shops and banks, staff are struggling to handle cash transactions without the smallest denomination coin.Retailers in several states have exhausted their penny supplies and can no longer provide exact change to customers paying with cash. Banks, meanwhile, say they are receiving no new stock and have begun rationing pennies to their clients.One regional chain, Sheetz, even tried to lure the coins back into circulation by offering customers a free soda in exchange for 100 pennies. Another business has warned that the shortage will cost millions this year because it is rounding transactions down to avoid legal challenges.“It’s a chunk of change,” Dylan Jeon, senior director of government relations with the National Retail Federation, told AP.The strain first became visible in late summer and is intensifying as retailers prepare for the busy holiday trading period.“We have been advocating abolition of the penny for 30 years. But this is not the way we wanted it to go,” said Jeff Lenard with the National Association of Convenience Stores.Banks said that they received little warning. Troy Richards, president of Guaranty Bank & Trust Co in Louisiana, told AP that penny deliveries abruptly stopped in August.“We got an email announcement from the Federal Reserve that penny shipments would be curtailed. Little did we know that those shipments were already over for us,” Richards said.The $1,800 worth of pennies his branches held disappeared within a fortnight. Only small, controlled amounts are now given to cheque-cashing customers.The sudden halt has also left companies pleading with consumers to pay with exact change.However, despite these struggles, not one retailer or bank is pushing to restore production of the coin, disliked due to its weight and limited use.“We don’t want the penny back. We just want some sort of clarity from the federal government on what to do, as this issue is only going to get worse,” the NACS’ Lenard said.A few days into his second term, on February 9, President Trump announced that the US will stop minting pennies, calling the decision part of a broader effort to streamline government spending. Both the penny and nickel have been more expensive to produce as compared to their costs.The US Mint’s latest report shows why: it cost 3.7 cents to make a penny in 2024, and 13.8 cents to produce a nickel.“Let’s rip the waste out of our great nation’s budget, even if it’s a penny at a time,” Trump wrote on Truth Social.The treasury department placed its final order for blank copper-zinc planchets ( metal disks that are minted into coins) in May. The last penny was minted in June and, by August, the remaining stocks were dispatched to banks and cash-handling companies.A bill, Common Cents Act, currently in Congress, proposes standardising cash payments by rounding to the nearest nickel. Businesses are open to it, but consumer advocates warn that rounding up could increase costs for shoppers.The treasury department has not responded to requests for guidance on how retailers and banks should manage the growing disruption.Other countries took years to phase out low-value coins. Canada announced the end of its one-cent piece in 2012 and eased out of using it through 2013, while Britain’s shift to the decimal system stretched across much of the 1960s and early 1970s.By contrast, the US removed the penny from circulation within months, and without legislative backing, a move that has left banks and retailers demanding clarity.The Mint: Despite issuing 3.23 billion pennies in 2024, more than any other US coin, most do not return to circulation. Americans tend to hoard pennies in jars or keep them as decor, forcing the Mint to manufacture billions each year. By ending production, the treasury expects to save $56 million, while the Mint remains profitable overall, generating $182 million in seigniorage last year through other coins and collectors’ sets.Compounding the issue, almost a third of the Federal Reserve’s coin distribution terminals are now closed to both penny withdrawals and deposits. That means regions that still have spare pennies have no way to send them to regions running out.“As a result of the US department of the treasury’s decision to end production of the penny, coin distribution locations accepting penny deposits and fulfilling orders will vary over time as (penny) inventory is depleted,” a Federal Reserve spokeswoman said.Retailers: Retailers now face legal complications. In several states, rounding cash transactions up to the nearest nickel is illegal, as it would unfairly disadvantage cash customers compared with card users.To avoid lawsuits, stores are rounding down instead, a policy that comes with a financial hit. Kwik Trip, a convenience chain in the Midwest, says rounding down at tills could cost it around $3 million this year. Others are encouraging customers to donate loose change at counters to avoid handling pennies altogether.","President Donald Trump halted production of the one-cent coin without introducing a transition plan.

US housing watch: 30-year mortgage rate slips to 6.17%; lowest in over a year as Fed cuts rates again,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-housing-watch-30-year-mortgage-rate-slips-to-6-17-lowest-in-over-a-year-as-fed-cuts-rates-again/articleshow/124962298.cms,"



The average long-term US mortgage rate has fallen to its lowest level in more than a year, offering some relief to homebuyers and homeowners amid a prolonged housing slump.Mortgage buyer Freddie Mac said on Thursday that the average rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage dropped to 6.17% from 6.19% last week -- its fourth consecutive weekly decline, AP reported. A year ago, the rate stood at 6.72%, while the last time it was lower was on October 3, 2024, at 6.12%.The average rate on 15-year fixed-rate mortgages, often favoured by homeowners refinancing their loans, also edged down to 5.41% from 5.44%. A year earlier, the rate was 5.99%, according to Freddie Mac.Lower mortgage rates improve homebuyers’ purchasing power and make refinancing more attractive. However, the broader US housing market has been sluggish since mortgage rates began rising above 6% in September 2022, following a long stretch of record lows.Sales of previously owned homes fell last year to their lowest level in nearly three decades. While activity picked up last month — the fastest pace since February — the sector remains under pressure.Mortgage rates typically track the 10-year Treasury yield, which moves with investors’ expectations for inflation and the economy. The yield rose to 4.08% in midday trading Thursday, up from below 4% over the past two weeks.The Federal Reserve this week cut its benchmark interest rate again to support the slowing job market. But Chair Jerome Powell cautioned that another reduction in December is “not a foregone conclusion.”Analysts said the Fed may pause further rate cuts if inflation rises -- a risk heightened by the Trump administration’s expanding use of tariffs. Persistent inflation could prompt investors to demand higher returns, lifting Treasury yields and, in turn, mortgage rates.While the Fed does not directly set mortgage rates, its policy moves influence broader borrowing costs. After its first rate cut in four years last fall, mortgage rates had unexpectedly climbed, topping 7% in January this year before easing again.","The average long-term US mortgage rate has fallen to its lowest level in more than a year.

The European Central Bank (ECB) on Thursday held interest rates unchanged at 2%, warning that the eurozone’s economic outlook remained “uncertain” amid global trade disputes and geopolitical tensions.After a year-long cycle of rate cuts, the ECB has maintained its key deposit rate at two percent since July, with inflation now stabilising around the central bank’s medium-term target, AFP reported.“Inflation remains close to the two-percent medium-term target and the Governing Council’s assessment of the inflation outlook is broadly unchanged,” the ECB said in a statement.Officials had signalled little ahead of the meeting to suggest a shift in policy. Jose Luis Escriva, Spain’s central bank chief and a member of the ECB’s governing council, said in an interview with El Diario that the “current level of interest rates is appropriate”.The meeting took place in Florence as part of the ECB’s regular rotation away from its Frankfurt headquarters, with investors now awaiting President Christine Lagarde’s press conference for cues on the rate trajectory.In contrast, the US Federal Reserve has resumed rate cuts, trimming borrowing costs for a second consecutive meeting on Wednesday by a quarter point, reflecting concern over a softening labour market.While the eurozone economy has fared better than expected — prompting the ECB to raise its growth forecast at its September meeting — policymakers remain divided on whether more rate cuts may be needed in coming months.The central bank faces headwinds including political uncertainty in France, which has driven up borrowing costs, along with trade risks and signs of slowing wage growth.Rate-setters appear “split with regard to the balance of risks to inflation and, therefore, on the need for an ‘insurance’ cut over the coming few months,” UniCredit analysts said this week.Lithuanian governing council member Gediminas Simkus had earlier argued for a cut at the ECB’s next meeting in December. “From a risk-management perspective, it’s better to cut than not,” he told Bloomberg, warning that a strong euro and slowing wages could drag inflation lower.Andrew Kenningham, economist at Capital Economics, told AFP he expected the ECB to resume cuts in 2026 as both inflation and wage growth weaken. “There are now very few reasons to fear a resurgence of inflation — the economy remains so weak, the labour market is loosening,” he said.",The European Central Bank (ECB) on Thursday held interest rates unchanged at 2%.

‘Very Good…’: Trump Drops Major Russian Oil Reveal After Talks With Xi, Lauds India





In a partial de-escalation of trade hostilities, the United States and China announced several tentative agreements on Thursday, including resumption by Beijing of global supply of rare earth elements and its purchase of US agricultural produce. The purported detente followed the first face-to-face meeting between President Donald Trump and President Xi Jinping in six years, held on the sidelines of the Apec summit in South Korea.On his way back to the US on Air Force One, President Trump, with his trademark hyperbole, rated the meeting a ""12"" out of 10, stating that an ""outstanding group of decisions"" were made, including a one-year unfreezing on China’s rare earth export controls which constrained supplies to the whole world, and which he expected to be renewed annually. Indicating the hard bargaining that took place, China, in turn, said the U.S. will pause its investigations targeting its maritime, logistics, and shipbuilding industries for one year, giving temporary relief to the exporting juggernaut.President Xi, clearly less effusive and more guarded than a euphoric Trump, confirmed separately through the state media a ""consensus on resolving"" important economic and trade issues while urging officials to follow up and refine the agreements to produce ""tangible results,” suggesting residual wrinkles will need to be ironed out in follow-up talks.Illustrative also of New Delhi’s sidelining in the tariff detente because of its lack of leverage, Trump told reporters on Air Force One that the matter of China buying Russian oil did not come up in talks with Xi even though they discussed ways to end the Russia-Ukraine war.“You know he's (Xi) been buying oil from Russia for a long time. It takes care of a big part of China and you know I can say India's been very good on that front, but, uh, we didn't really discuss the oil… we discussed working together to see if we could get that war finished..."" Trump said.The US has berated India for buying Russian oil and coerced it to taper purchase, but Trump’s remarks seemed to admit the US has no capacity to do the same to China.In fact, beneath his bravado and repeated assertions of a “great relationship” and ""tremendous success,"" critics noted that Trump faced a stone-faced Xi, who called for a focus on the ""long-term benefits of cooperation"" rather than falling into a ""vicious cycle of mutual retaliation.” Delivering a straight up lecture to Trump, the Chinese leader said it is normal for the world's two biggest economies to have differences, but they should aim to be ""partners and friends"" and maintain the ""overall stability"" of China-US relations.On his way home, Trump reeled off a long list of what he achieved at the talks – received skeptically by critics back home – including China ""resuming purchase of massive amounts of Soybeans, Sorghum, and other Farm products."" He claimed China has also “agreed to continue the flow of Rare Earth, Critical Minerals, Magnets, etc., openly and freely,” while Beijing indicated it was conditionally lifting the moratorium for a year.The US President also said “China has strongly stated that they will work diligently with us to stop the flow of Fentanyl into our Country” while lifting the additional 10 per cent fentanyl-related tariffs on Beijing, even as he appeared to ease restrictions on export of advanced semi-conductor chips, leaving it for Nvidia (the top tier US company which wants to export the chips with the argument that curtailing chips to China will simply result in it developing its own) to sort it out with Beijing.Trump lashed out at critics who suggested Xi had the better of him at the talks. “Worked really hard, 24/7, took in Trillions of Dollars, and Chuck Schumer said trip was “a total dud,” even though he knows it was a spectacular success. Words like that are almost treasonous!!!” he raged on X.","President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping met on the sidelines of the Apec summit in South Korea.

$101 Billion in 1 Day: How Larry Ellison Became the World’s Richest Man Explained

The resilience of American capital





The rest of the world can’t keep up





A system that rewards the bold and risk takers

The bigger picture









The world has an odd relationship with American wealth. It resents it, borrows from it, copies it, and yet, inevitably, revolves around it. Each time the global economy shifts, whether through inflation, trade wars, or a technology crash, the United States somehow emerges with more billionaires, more ultra-rich individuals, and a stronger gravitational pull on global capital. The latest data from Altrata’slays this bare in numbers almost too large to grasp: America now houses 38 percent of the world’s ultra-high-net-worth population, more than the combined share of the next ten nations.This is not a one-off statistical anomaly but a structural dominance. The United States has accumulated an extraordinary $22.3 trillion in private wealth held by just 192,470 individuals worth over $30 million each, a class of people whose fortunes collectively outstrip the GDP of entire continents. Despite political volatility, fluctuating markets, and a trade policy defined by tariffs and confrontation, the number of ultra-rich Americans surged by 21 percent last year alone. China, its nearest rival, holds just $5.9 trillion across 54,020 individuals.In addition to the US and China, the top 10 countries in terms of ultra-wealthy population include Germany, the United Kingdom, Japan, Hong Kong, Canada, France, Italy, and India, with the US far surpassing them in both total wealth and billionaire concentration.There is a peculiar kind of resilience baked into the American economy. Even when Washington imposes tariffs or restricts global trade, policies that, in theory, should stifle growth, the US finds new ways to profit from the disruption. Part of this stems from its diversified corporate ecosystem: Silicon Valley’s tech giants, Wall Street’s financial behemoths, and a robust private equity network that thrives on volatility rather than stability.Altrata’s research suggests that deregulation, tax incentives for the wealthy, and an extraordinarily dynamic stock market have allowed America’s richest to continue compounding their gains. Trump-era policies, criticised abroad as isolationist, often ended up fuelling domestic wealth creation. Reduced corporate taxes widened margins for American conglomerates and, in turn, expanded the net worth of their founders and shareholders.Technology, in particular, has been the great multiplier. Of the world’s five richest people, Elon Musk , Larry Ellison, Mark Zuckerberg Jeff Bezos , and Larry Page , all are American, all are products of the digital age, and all have created economic ecosystems around their companies. Musk’s $500 billion net worth alone symbolises this new era of tech-driven dominance, where innovation, capital, and state influence intersect seamlessly.The imbalance is stark. Even as Asia, Europe, and the Middle East diversify their economies, they have not come close to replicating the United States’ billionaire machine. China, once seen as the inevitable challenger, has stalled. With trade conflicts tightening and export restrictions weighing down its tech sector, China’s ultra-wealthy population has expanded only marginally. Altrata records a clear deceleration, a signal that state control and market dynamism still make uneasy companions.Europe, meanwhile, has crossed the 1,000-billionaire threshold for the first time, a symbolic milestone that pales in comparison to America’s 1,135. The continent’s wealth growth, though steady, lacks the risk appetite that defines US capitalism. The same volatility that unnerves regulators elsewhere is what keeps American enterprise alive.Altrata’s Billionaire Census 2025 offers another lens: North America’s billionaire population, dominated overwhelmingly by the United States — rose by 7.8 percent last year to 1,198 individuals, lifting its global share to 34 percent. Of these, 1,135 are American, reflecting how deeply the region’s wealth is concentrated in the US The combined worth now exceeds $13 trillion, greater than the market capitalisation of Apple , Microsoft, and NVIDIA combined.If there is a secret to America’s endurance, it lies in the way its system rewards audacity. American wealth creation has always been speculative, future-focused, and deeply individualistic. Venture capital flows freely, failure is survivable, and regulation tends to follow innovation rather than precede it. In that environment, capital compounds exponentially.By contrast, Europe’s wealth is old and institutional; Asia’s, new but constrained. American wealth remains entrepreneurial — and that makes all the difference. Even as global asset markets fluctuate and inflation tests every portfolio, the US continues to produce billionaires at a pace no one else can match. In 2024 alone, Altrata found that 10 percent of those worth between $1 billion and $2 billion globally dropped below that threshold. Yet in America, new entrants filled the gap almost immediately.That churn, that continuous regeneration of fortunes, is what defines the US advantage. It is not merely about size but renewal. The billionaire class in America does not remain static; it evolves alongside the technologies it funds and the markets it disrupts.There is an irony in all this. The United States, often criticised for inequality, remains the most effective wealth incubator in human history. Its share of the global ultra-wealthy may rise or fall slightly year to year, but the structure of its economy, open, competitive, and aggressively capitalist, ensures it never loses its lead for long.Tariffs, trade wars, or populist rhetoric may change the mood, but they have not changed the maths. As long as American innovation outpaces the rest of the world, and its financial system remains the global engine of liquidity, it will continue to dominate the billionaire game.It is fashionable to predict the end of the American century. But in the numbers, $22 trillion in private ultra-wealth, 38 percent of the world’s richest, and a billionaire population still rising faster than anyone else’s, the century looks far from over.","The world has an odd relationship with American wealth. It resents it, borrows from it, copies it, and yet, inevitably, revolves around it. The United States has accumulated an extraordinary $22.3 trillion in private wealth held by just 192,470 individuals worth over $30 million each. The number of ultra-rich Americans surged by 21 percent last year alone.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124953312,imgsize-892693,width-400,resizemode-4/elon-zuck-jeff-bezos.jpg"

A road that still runs one way





Donald Trump’s flair for bold declarations collided with Toyota’s characteristic restraint this week. During his visit to Japan, the US president announced that Toyota Motor was readying an investment “to the tune of over $10 billion” in the United States — a statement swiftly contradicted by the automaker itself. The episode has reignited discussion not only about political theatrics but also about the enduring imbalance between US and Japanese car markets, where American vehicles struggle to gain traction while Japanese brands dominate globally.Toyota moved quickly to clarify that no such promise had been made. “During the first Trump administration, I think the figure was roughly around $10 billion, so while we didn’t say the same scale, we did explain that we’ll keep investing and providing employment as before. So, probably because of that context, the figure of about $10 billion came up,” said Masahiko Ueda, a senior Toyota executive, speaking on the sidelines of the Japan Mobility Show in Tokyo. “Therefore, we didn’t specifically say that we’ll invest $10 billion over the next few years.”Ueda also added that the topic of investment “did not come up when Toyota Chairman Akio Toyoda briefly spoke to Trump at a US Embassy event on Tuesday evening,” according to Reuters.Toyota confirmed that while it remains committed to investing and creating jobs in the United States, there was no explicit commitment of the magnitude Trump had claimed.Trump’s remarks came during a high-profile trip to Japan, where he met the country’s new and first female prime minister, Sanae Takaichi. He hailed her pledge to accelerate Japan’s military build-up and the signing of new trade and rare-earth mineral agreements between the two nations. Takaichi, for her part, promised to usher in a “golden age” of US-Japan relations and “fundamentally reinforce” Japan’s defence posture.At a US naval base in Yokosuka, Trump addressed American troops aboard the USS, urging them to “go out and buy a Toyota.” He told service members: “They’re going to be putting auto plants all over the United States to the tune of $10 billion. So that’s Toyota, so go out and buy a Toyota.”In a symbolic gesture that blended diplomacy with automotive theatre, Trump was greeted in Tokyo by an enormous American-made Ford F-150 truck, a nod to a proposal within Japan’s government to buy a fleet of the vehicles. “She has good taste,” Trump quipped of Prime Minister Takaichi. “That’s a hot truck.”Beyond the theatrics lies the long-standing asymmetry between Japan’s thriving exports to America and the near-invisibility of US cars on Japanese roads. In 2024, Japan exported over 1.37 million vehicles to the United States, according to thecars remain the nation’s top export to America. Yet Japan imported fewer than 17,000 American vehicles that same year, per theThe gap is glaring but not new. Japan’s urban density, narrow streets, and compact parking spaces make smaller, fuel-efficient models far more practical. Large, heavy-duty American trucks and SUVs, by contrast, are an awkward fit. Even among affluent consumers who can afford imports, most opt for European makes like Mercedes-Benz, BMW, Volkswagen , or Audi.Former Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba put it bluntly in parliament earlier this year:Recent data from the(JADA), published 4 April 2025, shows just how skewed the domestic market is. Japanese manufacturers accounted for 93 per cent of all car sales in March 2025. More than half — 52.1 per cent — wereorpassenger cars, segments that US automakers do not produce for Japan. Toyota, Honda and Suzuki together hold 62.1 per cent of the market. About 40 per cent of all new cars sold are the ultra-compactcars, such as those by Suzuki and Daihatsu, vehicles tailored for Japan’s space-constrained environment.said Kristin Dziczek, vice-president of industry, labour & economics at the Center for Automotive Research.European automakers have succeeded precisely because they adapted. They invested in right-hand-drive models and local service networks. American firms lagged behind. Most US cars remain left-hand drive, a daily inconvenience in a country that drives on the left. The exception is Fiat Chrysler’s Jeep, whose rugged image resonates with Japanese buyers seeking a taste of Americana. The Jeep Wrangler, a symbol of outdoor adventure, dominates that niche. In 2024, European automakers sold over 100,000 vehicles in Japan: Mercedes-Benz (53,195 units), BMW (35,240), Volkswagen (22,779), and Audi (21,415). Jeep sold 9,633, while General Motors and Ford together barely passed a thousand. Ford, in fact, withdrew from Japan in 2017.Meanwhile, Japanese makers flourish across the Pacific. Toyota alone sold over 2.3 million vehicles in the United States in 2024, making it the nation’s second-largest carmaker. The imbalance is stark: Japan fills US roads, while US cars scarcely register in Japan.Cultural and infrastructural realities keep the divide intact. Japanese consumers prize efficiency, compactness, and reliability, attributes embodied by their homegrown brands. US cars, often larger and less fuel-conscious, remain misaligned with local expectations. Even enthusiasts who appreciate American classics worry about maintenance, spare parts, and servicing.Some US manufacturers are trying to adjust. General Motors now offers a right-hand-drive version of its eighth-generation Chevrolet Corvette, signalling belated recognition of Japan’s needs. But the impact is marginal. Jeep’s 0.2 per cent market share is still the highest for any US marque, and no American model cracks Japan’s top-50 best-sellers.The numbers tell their own story. About 95 per cent of cars on Japanese roads are Japanese-made. Imports occupy the remaining sliver, mostly European. The US footprint is microscopic, limited to niche collectors of vintage Cadillacs or Chevrolets.Trump’s exaggerated claim, then, isn’t merely a political misstep, it’s emblematic of a broader truth. The automotive relationship between America and Japan has never been one of equals. One builds cars the world buys; the other struggles to sell its own beyond its borders. Toyota’s polite correction to Trump’s boast underscores that reality: for all the talk of new investment, the road between Detroit and Tokyo still runs mostly one way.","U.S. President Donald Trump’s flair for bold declarations collided with Toyota's characteristic restraint this week.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground.Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change, too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Startups will play an important role in helping India become the third largest economy in the world, Chief Economic Advisor ( CEA ) to the Union government V Anantha Nageswaran has said.Nageswaran said that tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country due to improvements in infrastructure and supportive policies of the government, according to a KSUM release.The CEA, during his Leadership Talk on the concluding day of the Huddle Global 2023 organised by the Kerala Startup Mission (KSUM), said that India was the fifth largest economy on course to become the third largest in a few years.""In fact, I will say 7-in-7 is the buzz slogan, that is 7 trillion USD economy in seven years. Seven trillion USD economy size by 2030 is possible if India maintains its present growth trajectory, and in that journey startup entrepreneurs are going to play an important role,"" he is quoted as having said in the release.He was of the view that the active participation of startups in India in developing business models on the foundation of expanding physical and digital infrastructure will continue to generate efficiency, revenue and economic returns for the country.""The last decade has seen an exceptional transformation in the startup landscape in India, which has emerged as the third largest ecosystem globally, with over 1.12 lakh startups presently recognised by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) across 763 districts.""Among them, more than 110 are unicorns with a total valuation of around USD 350 billion,"" he said.The CEA further said that the country ranks second in innovation quality.He said that innovation in India was not just limited to certain sectors as startups were solving problems in 56 industrial sectors, with 13 per cent of them from IT services, nine per cent from health and life sciences, seven per cent from education, five per cent from agriculture and five per cent from food and beverages.Nageswaran also said it was significant that 49 per cent of the startups were from tier-2 and 3 cities which have turned to be game-changers as the business advantages in these locations enable entrepreneurs to operate at lower costs as compared to tier-1 cities.""Apart from improved infrastructure and the government's pro-active policies, the availability of a technically skilled talent pool is a huge advantage for startups to set up and flourish in tier-2 and tier-3 cities,"" he said.He said that historically there was a perception that small towns were difficult places to conduct business.""...but with improved internet penetration, vastly better physical infrastructure, road, rail and air connectivity and supportive government policies, this is no longer true,"" he said.He also noted Kerala's startup journey has been an inspiring one.The CEA said that KSUM has served as the catalyst since its establishment in 2006 to promote change that propelled the state into the forefront of the global startup arena.KSUM is the Kerala government's nodal agency established in 2006 for entrepreneurship development and incubation activities in the state.Nageswaran said that with over 4,000 registered tech startups, 63 incubators and 10 lakh square feet of incubation space, KSUM has not only met its goal of promoting technology-based entrepreneurship but has also earned the distinguished position of being among the world's top business incubators.The November 16-18 fifth edition of Huddle Global, India's biggest beachside startup conclave, was organised by KSUM at Adimalathura beach, near Vizhinjam, here.Attended by around 1,500 delegates, the event displayed sophisticated products from emerging sectors such as robotics, Artificial Intelligence , Machine Learning, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, life sciences, space tech, blockchain, IoT, e-governance, fintech, healthtech, agritech, edutech and SaaS from across the country.","Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran said tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country.

E-Commerce startup Udaan to trim costs ahead of 2025 IPO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/e-commerce-startup-udaan-to-trim-costs-ahead-of-2025-ipo/articleshow/105001132.cms,"E-commerce startup Udaan is working to curb costs and forge new partnerships with consumer brands in India as it prepares to go public in 2025.Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta said in an interview. That’s set to happen around the same time as its initial public offering, he said.The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said. “Second, strategically we want to ensure that we are top of mind with shopkeepers, with big manufacturers, and we maintain our relative market share.”Lightspeed Venture Partners-backed Udaan is among startups trying to tap the rapid growth of India’s economy and consumer market, while meeting investor demands for profitability. Udaan, which at its peak employed thousands, joined fellow Indian startups in slashing jobs last year and tightening internal controls and compliance. It now has about 1,800 staff, and Gupta didn’t specify if further job cuts are needed.Corporate governance lapses at Indian online tutoring firm Byju’s, once the country’s top startup with a valuation of $22 billion, shone a light at unique challenges faced by founders in the South Asian nation and drove companies to be more diligent.“We continue to move towards more professionalized management, professionalized board and also institutionalized shareholders as we go towards public markets,” Gupta said.Udaan is yet to decide whether it will list in India or overseas. It was valued at more than $3 billion in a 2021 funding round, and was in talks to raise $400 million, Business Standard reported in September. Lightspeed owns about 35% of Udaan, while Tencent Holdings Ltd. holds 6%.The company was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran Udaan until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021. The other two founders — Amod Malviya and Sujeet Kumar — are board members.Udaan built an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business still accounts for a very small part of India’s overall retail market but can balloon to $150 billion in sales and yield a 100% return on capital invested in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co. estimates published in the Mint newspaper.Bengaluru-based Udaan has also ventured into financing through its fintech unit which helps shopkeepers get working capital loans to buy inventory. That business is profitable before taxes and is growing 70% annually, Gupta said.“That’s a second business in the overall umbrella of Udaan trying to organize trade in the country,” Gupta said. “In addition to commerce, financing becomes an important market opportunity.”","Udaan will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta says.

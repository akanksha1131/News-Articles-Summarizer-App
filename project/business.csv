Bengaluru GST row: Small scale traders and merchants in Karnataka have expressed grave apprehension following the receipt of GST notifications from the commercial tax authorities regarding UPI transactions surpassing Rs 40 lakh per year. They have appealed to the authorities to withdraw these notices and sought leniency in implementing these regulations for small-scale vendors.The issue came to light after it was reported that vendors in Bengaluru are increasingly declining UPI as a payment mode, asking customers to pay in cash instead.A vegetable vendor from Haveri, Shankar Gowda Hadimani, expressed his worries after receiving a tax notice of ₹29 lakh from the Bengaluru Tax Office.According to an ANI report he explained, ""... Since there are no GST rules on fruits and vegetables, I did not register for GST number. But I got a notice to pay Rs 29 lakh in taxes for a business of over Rs 40 lakh... The officials have told me that if it is proven that I have done so much business in vegetables, the notice will be withdrawn...""Abhilash Shetty, representing the Karnataka Pradesh Street Vendors Association, was reported as saying, ""Small businesses run with a margin of 5 to 10 percent...The tax (GST) along with other things like penalty, comes to 50% and it is not possible for the vendors to pay such a huge tax with this. We request the government to interfere and give relaxation to the small vendors in this matter...""Advocate Shakuntala, the legal counsel for the association, supported these concerns whilst criticising the authorities for not properly informing small vendors about their taxation responsibilities during business registration.She remarked, ""If taxes are being imposed, why were they not educated first?... When they took the registration, they should have been made aware about the taxes on selling of goods, revenue...""BJP has criticised the issuance of GST notices for UPI transactions in Karnataka.BJP spokesperson Amit Malviya stated, ""Congress is destroying small businesses in Karnataka. In a recent mindless crackdown, Karnataka GST authorities have issued heavy-handed notices to small vendors under the pretext of GST evasion -- many running into lakhs of rupees. The data from UPI transactions is being weaponized to raise arbitrary tax demands. As a result, thousands of small traders in Bengaluru are now abandoning digital payments altogether. This is not just harassment -- it is economic sabotage.""He further added, ""Under GST law, the burden of proof lies with the tax officer -- not the trader. Why then is the Congress government unleashing this coercion on those who form the backbone of our economy? This is nothing but a desperate attempt to fund their freebie culture. And yet, Rahul Gandhi has the audacity to claim he stands with small businesses.""","Small scale traders and merchants in Karnataka have expressed grave apprehension following the receipt of GST notifications.

SGB 2018-19 Series-V Redemption Value

Understanding SGB Redemption Price Calculation

Investment Returns Analysis



SGB Interest Payment Structure

Is there flexibility to redeem SGBs before maturity?

What is the process for exiting an SGB investment?

Soverign Gold Bond redemption: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has announced the early redemption value for Sovereign Gold Bonds (SGB) 2018-19 Series-V. Investors can opt for early redemption only after holding the bonds for five years from the issue date.According to RBI, the above mentioned SGB is up for early redemption on Tuesday, July 22, 2025. These gold bonds reach maturity after an 8-year period from their issue date.Sovereign Gold Bonds or SGBs are in essence government-backed securities that are measured in grams of gold. They serve as an alternative to investment in physical gold. Investors need to make cash payments for purchasing these bonds, and upon maturity, they receive cash settlements. The Government of India authorises the Reserve Bank of India to manage the issuance of these bonds.We take a look at the early redemption value, potential returns from choosing premature redemption, and other details as listed in an ET report:For SGBs due for early redemption on July 22, 2025, the redemption value is set at Rs 9,820 per unit. This calculation considers the average closing gold prices over three business days: July 17, 2025, July 18, 2025, and July 21, 2025.""The redemption price of SGB shall be based on the simple average of the closing gold price of 999 purity of the previous three business days from the date of redemption, as published by the India Bullion and Jewellers Association Ltd (IBJA),” says RBI in its July 21, 2025 release.The initial issue price of SGB 2018-19 Series-V in January 2019 was Rs 3214 per gram. The absolute gain amounts to Rs 6,606 (Rs 9,820 - Rs 3214), excluding interest earnings. This represents a substantial return of 205.56% on the investment.For investors Sovereign Gold Bonds mean a fixed annual interest of 2.50% on the principal investment amount. The interest payments are credited twice a year directly to the investor's bank account. The final interest crediting happens at maturity in addition to the principal amount.Whilst the bonds have an 8-year tenure, early redemption is permitted after five years from issuance on specified coupon payment dates. When held in demat format, these bonds can be traded on exchanges. Additionally, they are transferable to other qualified investors.If you want to opt for early redemption, you have to contact your bank/SHCIL offices/Post Office/agent 30 days before to the coupon payment date. Early redemption requests are processed only if they ate submitted at least one day before the coupon payment date. The redemption amount is then transferred to the bank account specified during the bond application.","Sovereign Gold Bonds or SGBs are government-backed securities measured in grams of gold.

Top stock market recommendations: According to Aakash K Hindocha, Deputy Vice President - WM Research, Nuvama Professional Clients Group, Balkrishna Industries, Sona BLW Precision Forgings, and Hindalco are the top buy calls for today. Here’s his view on Nifty , Bank Nifty and the top stock picks for July 24, 2025:Nifty has entered a consolidation zone once again, though broader trend indicates upside from current levels, but absence of tailwinds are keeping the index in range. We continue with our view on a broad consolidation between 24800 and 25320 for the balance of this week, given the chart structure and positioning based on derivative data. Given the tailwind from Nifty IT, this could allow positive rub off on the index as well allowing it to breakout above 25320 for a sustained up move.After reclaiming its resistance of 56750 in Monday’s session, the index has furthered its ongoing breakout above 57100 to allow momentum on the long side on Bank Nifty. Outperformance against Nifty which has been powering the underlying current on this index, is set to continue.On the flip side, closing below 56700 could allow downward pressure on the index. Targets are open for new all time highs on the index.Balkrishna Industries stock has given a cup and handle breakout on daily chart at the start of this week. This pattern has been in place from the start of this calendar year marking an end of its 6 month consolidation. Given the set up this suggests a 10-12% upside from current levels.After hitting a 3.5 year low at the start of this fiscal, Sona BLW Precision Forgings has found buyers to scale it up towards the 540-550 odd zone. Rally and retests have allowed a bullish pole and flag pattern breakout on charts. Adding to this a 2 month old sloping trendline breakout has also been confirmed in Wednesday’s closing.All of this allows for the ongoing rally to continue to a retest of its 200 DMA resistance at 545+.HINDALCO has given a 9 month trendline breakout same time last month, but the stock had been missing follow through, a retest and back to the breakout price has made way for a follow through to play out. Stock has also sustained above its 200 DMA for four consecutive weeks now, enabling for further upside on charts.","Top stock market recommendations: According to Aakash K Hindocha, Balkrishna Industries, Sona BLW Precision Forgings, and Hindalco are the top buy calls for today.

MUMBAI: Indians are sending less money abroad. Under the liberalised remittance scheme (LRS), overseas remittances by resident individuals fell to $2.3 billion in May 2025 from $2.5 billion in April. This marks a further decline from the average monthly outflow of $2.5 billion in FY25 and $2.8 billion in FY24.While sending money abroad for education has taken a hit because of visa restrictions, the trend reflects a broader effort by the government to curb capital outflows through increased scrutiny of funds sent under the 'gift' route. Over the past year, authorities have introduced a tax collected at source (TCS) on foreign remittances and have mandated utilisation of funds sent abroad within 180 days failing which they have to be repatriated. This in effect prevents Indians from maintaining idle funds in foreign deposits. Also, caps on overseas investments by mutual funds, constrained avenues for overseas investment.In May, the decline was broad-based. Outflows for equity and debt investments fell by almost half, from $203 million in April to $105 million in May. Gifting also declined from $291 million to $233 million. Remittances for maintaining close relatives abroad fell from $398 million to $323 million. Spending on education and property purchases abroad also moderated.Even travel, which had rebounded post-pandemic, showed signs of tempering. Outflows rose from $1.3 billion in April to $1.4 billion in May, but the pace was slower than in previous months.","Under the liberalised remittance scheme (LRS), overseas remittances by resident individuals fell to $2.3 billion in May 2025.

MUMBAI: Tilaknagar Industries, maker of Mansion House brandy is acquiring the Imperial Blue business from the Indian unit of French liquor giant Pernod Ricard in a Rs 4,150-crore all-cash deal to ""fast-track"" its foray into the whisky segment. The transaction includes deferred payment of Rs 282 crore, to be paid four years after the deal, which is expected to close in six months, the company said in a late night filing on Wednesday.The acquisition, pegged to be the largest in the local alcoholic beverages space by an Indian company, will allow Tilaknagar, which has a big share in brandy space to build a strong whisky portfolio across premium price-points, tapping into growing premiumisation trend besides expanding its distribution reach.Imperial Blue, for which India is the biggest market with over 90% of its sales, is the third-largest whisky brand in the country by volume. With a sales volume of 22.4 million cases, Imperial Blue accounts for about a 9% volume share in the whisky category. To give a broader perspective of the whisky market, about 79 million cases are sold annually in India.""Having achieved leadership in the brandy segment, it is now time for us to broaden our portfolio and cater to India's diverse and evolving consumer base.

'I-T dept ensures strict confidentiality of data',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/i-t-dept-ensures-strict-confidentiality-of-data/articleshow/122870637.cms,"CBDT chairman Ravi Agrawal

How will the new I-T

Act help the common

taxpayer?

The tax department has access to enormous amounts of data and the bill provides power to the department to access social media accounts for investigation purposes. How will the department ensure privacy of data?

The focus of the department now is building

taxpayer trust but how

will the new powers

impact this?

How would you assure the taxpayers on this?

What has been the role

of technology in stepping up refunds?

How is the department using AI, ML and blockchain technology to

maximise revenues and plug loopholes?

The income tax department adheres to strict confidentiality of taxpayer data, says CBDT chairman Ravi Agrawal and asserts that stringent internal controls are in place to uphold confidentiality and integrity. In an interview to TOI, Agrawal says the powers to access digital devices during search and survey operations are merely being updated in the new I-T Bill to reflect the digital age. Excerpts:The provisions of law will become far more simpler for any taxpayer to read and understand. The dependence on a professional to understand the law is expected to see some correction. The use of formulae, tables and consolidation of provisions will enable easier compliance for taxpayers and professionals.The I-T Bill, 2025 only re-states and makes explicit the powers already implicit in the Income-Tax Act 1961 under section 132.It is important to understand that these provisions are strictly applicable only during search and survey operations. They are not meant to breach the online privacy of common taxpayers, even if their case is under scrutiny. The powers to access digital devices and information during search and survey operations have always existed and are merely being updated to reflect the digital age. Clause 247 of the bill, which allows overriding access codes, is a modernisation of these existing provisions.With financial activities increasingly moving online, including digital banking, cryptocurrency, and cloud storage, these powers are intended to combat sophisticated methods of tax evasion that utilise internet-based tools and technology. Regarding data security, CBDT is acutely aware of the sensitivity of the financial data it handles. Our data collection and analysis are strictly for the purpose of tax administration and are governed by the provisions of I-T Act, 1961. Stringent internal controls have been instituted to uphold confidentiality and integrity, with access to taxpayer data strictly controlled and monitored. The principle of ""need-to-know"" is followed. The faceless nature of core procedures such as assessments and appeals introduces a layer of anonymity by design. Cases are randomly allocated through an automated system, ensuring neither the taxpayer nor the assessing officer knows each other's identity. This reinforces a neutral, fair, and objective approach, minimising the risk of selective targeting. Risk assessment uses identity-blind, rule-based algorithms.I-T Bill, 2025 provides for no new or additional powers. The department will continue to work on a ""Trust First and Scrutinise Later"" philosophy, recognising that most taxpayers are honest. The department prefers the ""nudge"" approach for minor discrepancies, while intrusive steps are for cases with credible intelligence or significant evidence of large-scale tax evasion, concealment of income, or involvement in illicit activities.The goal is to create a deterrent effect for willful defaulters while fostering a climate of trust for the honest taxpayer. By clearly defining the scope of these powers to serious evasion cases, the department aims to assure honest taxpayers that they will not be arbitrarily targeted.There is no question of any general surveillance of common taxpayers or their social media accounts. The fundamental approach remains ""Trust First,"" with intrusive actions being a last resort only for proven, large-scale evasion cases, not for honest taxpayers. Even when an algorithm flags a case for scrutiny, subsequent proceedings involve human application of mind and a review mechanism to ensure fairness. Taxpayers also retain the right to appeal any order they believe is incorrect.End-to-end automation of ITR processing, including real-time challan validation and automated refund processing, has been implemented. Bank account validation ensures seamless refund disbursal. The average refund processing time has reduced from 93 days in FY 2013-14 to 17 days in 2024-25. Faster refund processing has significantly improved the taxpayer experience and confidence in the system.The use of AI within the I-T department is limited now. Going forward, AI will play a critical role in detecting and curbing shell companies, black money, and benami transactions. The upcoming projects of the department such as Insight 2.0 aims at wider use of AI. For example, AI will be used in various areas such as fraud and anomaly detection, pattern recognition, trend identification, predictive modelling, processing of unstructured data.","The income tax department adheres to strict confidentiality of taxpayer data, says CBDT chairman Ravi Agrawal.

MUMBAI: RBI has expressed guarded optimism about the country's economic trajectory, even as it acknowledged mounting global uncertainties and domestic pressures.In its state of the economy report, the central bank noted that economic activity remains resilient, supported by improved prospects for the kharif crop, sustained momentum in services, and modest industrial growth. Yet, the macroeconomic environment, both globally and domestically, remains volatile.The report points to a broad-based moderation in economic indicators. Industrial activity has weakened, with the Index of Industrial Production falling to a nine-month low in May. Demand-side signals also softened, including a slowdown in petroleum consumption and a marginal decline in electricity use. Bank credit growth lost steam across key sectors, with lending by non-bank financial companies contracting and personal loans decelerating. Public finances showed strain, marked by widening state deficits and a sharp reduction in Union govt grants.Inflation pressures have resurfaced. Core inflation ticked up in June due to rising personal care costs, while a rebound in onion prices reversed earlier corrections in food inflation. RBI cautioned that ""oil price surges have often been associated with a downturn in economic growth and worsening trade and current account balances,"" adding that ""oil price volatility can be debilitating for the Indian economy"".Rising oil import dependence, it noted, could amplify long-term inflation risks.The external sector has turned fragile. Capital inflows were inadequate to finance the current account deficit, leading to a $5-billion fall in forex reserves. The rupee weakened against the dollar in June, and external commercial borrowing registrations dropped on a year-on-year basis.Labour market signals were mixed. High demand for MGNREGS jobs pointed to rural employment stress, while the labour force participation rate and worker population ratio declined slightly, particularly in rural areas. Household inflation expectations remain elevated and divergent.","The report points to a broad-based moderation in economic indicators.

BENGALURU: When Karan Vaidya, co-founder of AI infra startup Composio, promised a Porsche to anyone who referred a product engineer that joined their San Francisco team and stayed three months, it sounded like a stunt. But he wasn’t joking. “Not kidding,” he wrote in the now-viral X post, complete with a photo of a black Porsche model he had in mind.Just hours later, Roy Lee, co-founder of Cluely, another early-stage AI startup, chimed in with his own no-nonsense offer. “I’ll triple your base salary,” he posted, as he searched for a founding designer. “No questions asked.”The timing is uncanny. This same week, Microsoft reportedly poached 24 AI researchers from Google DeepMind, including Amar Subramanya, the former engineering head of the Gemini team, who is now a corporate VP at Microsoft AI. A day later, Meta hired three DeepMind scientists who had helped build a language model that achieved gold medal-level performance in the International Math Olympiad. Meta has also been aggressively staffing its new Superintelligence unit, reportedly offering compensation packages of over $100 million to lure away top researchers from OpenAI and Anthropic.For founders like Vaidya and Lee, who are building AI-native products in public, the job post has become a statement.It’s part recruitment, part performance art and very much a reflection of how fierce the competition for technical talent has become in AI.“There’s a real risk that we’re overpaying for momentum and mistaking it for durability,” said Manav Garg, co-founder and managing partner at Together Fund. “High-visibility compensation moves can bring in mercenaries rather than missionaries. That’s dangerous for early-stage companies where cultural fit and long-term belief in the vision are as critical as technical skill.”Composio recently raised $25 million in a Series A round led by Lightspeed, with participation from Elevation Capital, Together Fund, and several prominent angels. Cluely, which positions itself as an AI-native workspace tool, raised $15 million from Andreessen Horowitz. A Porsche, in this context, is relatively modest, starting around $110,000 in the US, it’s a small fraction of what top-tier AI engineers can command in total annual compensation.For many investors, the current frenzy feels inevitable. “Talent is IP,” said Avijeet Alagathi, founder of Shastra VC. “Capital solves for little in this space, so it’s being used to buy and retain talent.”Thiyagarajan Maruthavanan, co-founder at Upekkha, described the market as unforgiving. “In AI, the fourth player doesn’t even matter,” he said. “The people who can orchestrate systems at scale are reaching infinite price.”For now, in a winner-takes-all environment, founders are betting that conviction, like a Porsche, can still turn heads.","Karan Vaidya, co-founder of AI infra startup Composio, promised a Porsche to anyone who referred a product engineer that joined their San Francisco team and stayed three months.

The European Union 's ban on Russian crude-derived fuels, set to take effect from January 21 next year, may provide momentary respite in terms of implementation.However, its stringent classification of Russia-origin fuels could create difficulties for Indian exporters.The EU unveiled its newest sanctions against Russia last week, incorporating limitations on fuel imports processed from Russian crude oil. This development could affect Reliance Industries , which maintains has Russian oil imports whilst exporting considerable fuel volumes to European markets, according to an ET report.Also Read | 'We're going to crush your economy': US Senator warns India, China, Brazil over 'cheap' Russian oil; threatens to 'tariff the hell out' On Monday, Reliance Industries' shares declined by 3.3% to ₹1,428.20, despite the BSE Sensex benchmark rising by 0.5%. This drop followed several brokerage reports indicating the company's earnings fell short of projections. The company had previously announced a 78% year-on-year increase in quarterly profits to ₹26,994 crore on Friday.The European Union released legal documentation during the weekend explaining the implementation process of its newest sanctions package.According to the legal document, those importing oil must submit proof regarding the source country of crude oil utilised in product refinement.""Petroleum products imported from third countries which were net exporters of crude oil in the previous calendar year shall be considered to have been obtained from domestic crude oil and not from crude oil originating in Russia, unless a competent authority has reasonable grounds to believe that they have been obtained from Russian crude oil,"" the legal text says according to the financial daily’s report.This interpretation suggests that fuel exports from India, being a net crude oil importer, might be subject to these sanctions. The situation becomes more complex considering India's status as one of the two largest buyers of Russian oil.The European Commission is set to release guidelines specifying the type of evidence importers need to submit to verify crude origin.Also Read | Russia oil squeeze: Trump’s 100% tariff threat - should India panic?","The European Union's ban on Russian crude-derived fuels, set to take effect from January 21 next year, may provide momentary respite in terms of implementation.

'Reaping the rewards': Why short-term investors leaning towards ICICI Bank over HDFC Bank? Key reasons explained,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/reaping-the-rewards-why-short-term-investors-leaning-towards-icici-bank-over-hdfc-bank-key-reasons-explained/articleshow/122831258.cms,"(Disclaimer: Recommendations and views on the stock market and other asset classes given by experts are their own. These opinions do not represent the views of The Times of India)

Short-term investors are leaning towards ICICI Bank in the private banking space, thanks to its solid June quarter results. With strong profit growth and steady margins, ICICI is currently edging out rival HDFC Bank in investor preference.HDFC Bank is currently dealing with various post-merger issues, notably an elevated credit-deposit (CD) ratio, which has affected investor confidence. The high CD ratio indicates that deposit growth is not keeping pace with credit expansion.Despite both institutions maintaining premier banking networks across India, analysts note ICICI's current advantageous position.""ICICI Bank is reaping the rewards of a well-executed transformation, showing clarity and consistency, while HDFC Bank navigates a transitional phase post-merger,"" Shrikant Chouhan, head, equity research, Kotak Securities told ET.Following its June quarter results and weekend announcements regarding dividend and bonus issue, HDFC Bank shares increased by over 2% on Monday.ICICI Bank shares rose nearly 3% after reporting healthy profit growth, supported by stable net interest margins and robust asset quality. HDFC Bank's performance has raised some concerns.Post-merger, with its CD ratio remaining in the 90s, the bank faces difficulties in efficient liquidity deployment, affecting immediate loan growth and NIMs.ICICI Bank's superior near-term earnings visibility makes it more attractive to short-term investors.""ICICI Bank seems to be a preferred pick with its robust asset quality, strong capital position and sustained profitability momentum,"" Prashanth Tapse, senior VP (research), Mehta Equities told ET.Regarding HDFC Bank, Tapse notes that the stock's underperformance is likely to continue due to valuation adjustments and subdued post-merger earnings.Although ICICI Bank is currently preferred, analysts maintain close observation of HDFC Bank. The institution has projected to surpass industry growth in FY27 earnings and match industry performance in FY26.For short to medium-term investors seeking stability and earnings visibility, ICICI Bank remains the preferred choice, according to market experts. However, for long-term bets, HDFC Bank may gain favour, once there's more clarity on its post-merger growth trajectory and how it stacks up against ICICI Bank.","ICICI Bank's superior near-term earnings visibility makes it more attractive to short-term investors.

What is the TCS Benching Policy ?

TCS Benching Policy Impact

TCS Benching Policy: Industry Impact

Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) employees are worried about layoffs as the first round of the new benching policy at India’s largest IT services giant ends. Several TCS employees appear to be taking to social media platforms like Reddit to express their concerns about their role and future in TCS.The newly implemented benching guidelines effective from June 12 restrict the non-billable period to 35 days annually, beyond which employees could face professional setbacks or possible job loss.According to an ET report, employees have reported various challenges, including urgent project searches, assignments in mismatched skill areas, unsuccessful client interviews, and difficulties securing projects in preferred locations.A concerned Reddit participant was quoted as saying, ""This is the first step towards employment rationalisation based on utilisation. Brace for layoffs.""A new recruit shared, ""I have recently joined TCS and training was conducted in Java. Now, it's not even a month on bench and RMG is pressuring me to join a *** support project, far from Java and Python.""However, the financial daily could not verify the veracity of the posts on Redditt.Explaining the revised bench policy, TCS chief executive and managing director K Krithivasan told Times of India: ""It's always been expected that associates take responsibility for their careers. While HR supports project placement, we also expect associates to proactively seek new assignments after completing existing ones. What you're seeing now is simply a more structured version of what's long been in practice. We aim to minimise bench time.""Also Read | Infosys vs Cognizant fight gets uglier! Why are the two big IT firms battling it out in the US? Explained The company prioritises substantial investment in employee development. ""Once we've made that investment, we work to ensure associates are deployed,"" he said. ""While preferences are considered, projects are driven by client needs, not personal choice. We deploy based on training, demand, and skill alignment. If gaps exist, we work to close them before deployment.""When questioned about TCS withholding salaries for staff on extended bench periods, Krithivasan offered no direct response.The exact impact on the TCS workforce remains uncertain. Based on industry data, approximately 15-18% of employees at major Indian IT companies typically remain on bench. TCS, which leads India's IT sector, currently employs around 613,000 individuals.Last week a workers' rights organisation approached Union labour minister Mansukh Mandaviya, requesting immediate intervention regarding TCS's bench policy, which they described as ""inhumane,"" ""exploitative"" and mentally taxing for technology professionals.Nascent Information Technology Employees Senate (NITES) submitted a formal complaint to the minister, claiming that TCS is pressuring benched employees through termination threats and withholding experience certificates if they cannot secure project assignments within specified timeframes.Also Read | TCS gives out variable pay! Over 70% employees to get 100% variable; no decision yet on salary hikes ""These are not non-performing employees, but skilled professionals who find themselves temporarily without allocation… Instead of support, they are met with suspicion, coercion, and threats,"" NITES president Harpreet Singh Saluja said in the letter.Some staff members are however backing TCS' decision, noting that numerous employees have stayed unassigned for extended periods, turning down offered projects. These individuals have used their unallocated time for pursuing additional qualifications whilst not contributing to the organisation's productivity.""This may help TCS trimming some seriously underperforming resources, those stuck on TCS like a leech,"" a Reddit user posted.The IT sector anticipates significant changes as artificial intelligence (AI) begins to automate routine operations.""We expect IT companies to become stricter with their bench policies due to the soft business environment and AI-led demand for advanced skill sets,"" Pareekh Jain, founder and CEO of EIIRTrend told ET. He observed that staff expenses are notably affecting company profit margins.The stringent bench policy implemented by TCS might influence other IT firms, as managing bench strength becomes increasingly challenging due to AI-driven productivity improvements making it harder to reassign entry-level engineers, according to industry specialists.""Tech companies must continuously align their employees' skill sets with evolving client needs. By revisiting their bench policies, organisations are encouraging employees to reskill and stay relevant in high-demand areas such as AI, cybersecurity, and digital engineering,"" said Nitin Bhatt, technology sector leader at EY India according to the financial daily’s report.""Going forward, tenure and grade-based promotions and merit increases will likely be replaced by assessments of skills proficiency and competencies required to take on new roles,"" he added.Also Read | ‘Character assassination’: Delhi HC asks Wipro to pay Rs 2 lakh for defamation of ex-employee; termination letter full of ‘stigma and insinuations’","Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) employees are worried about layoffs as the first round of the new benching policy at India’s largest IT services giant ends.

Neodymium (Nd): Permanent magnets in motors, headphones, microphones, hard drives, speakers

Praseodymium (Pr): Magnets (with Nd), aircraft engines, fibre optic cables

Dysprosium (Dy): Improves heat resistance in magnets, used in EV motors, hard drives, earbuds

Terbium (Tb): Phosphors for green colour in displays and lighting

Samarium (Sm): High-strength magnets for headphones, microwave devices, small motors

India’s ambitions in electronics, electric vehicles (EVs), and clean energy may face critical challenges due to its limited domestic production of rare earth elements (REEs), despite holding sizable reserves.China continues to dominate the global REE supply chain, controlling over 90 per cent of the world’s processing and magnet-making capacity, reported ET.Rare earths, 17 elements with unique magnetic, luminescent, and electrochemical properties, are essential for a wide range of high-tech and green energy products. From permanent magnets in EV motors and wind turbines to phosphors in LED lights and data storage in MRI machines, these materials are foundational to next-generation technologies.Here’s how individual elements are used:Other REEs, Scandium, Holmium, Thulium, Lutetium, Ytterbium, Promethium, are vital in specialised lasers, sensors, electronic devices, and medical imaging systems.According to ET, China alone accounts for nearly 70 per cent of global rare earth mining, with countries like the US (12 per cent), Myanmar (10 per cent), and Australia (8 per cent) following distantly.India, though possessing around 6–7 million metric tonnes of reserves, about 6–7 per cent of the global total, contributes less than 1 per cent to the world’s annual output.This creates a major vulnerability for Indian manufacturers. Any disruption or restriction in supply from China could severely impact production lines, especially in EVs, smartphones, and defence systems. As per ET, this gives Beijing immense leverage.While the US has tried building its own capacity in light rare earths like neodymium and cerium, China remains the primary source for most critical elements, including dysprosium, terbium, and yttrium.","Rare earths, 17 elements with unique magnetic, luminescent, and electrochemical properties, are essential for a wide range of high-tech and green energy products.

Pakistan’s Debt Trouble in Numbers

Pakistan’s foreign exchange reserves of $14.5 billion at end-June consist primarily of refinanced loans, rollovers and new borrowings. This situation demonstrates the country's increasing dependence on external lenders, which poses risks to economic stability, the PTI report said.

The fiscal year 2024-25 saw disbursements of $26.7 billion, which is a marginal increase from the previous fiscal period, according to combined data from the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) and the Ministry of Finance.

Pakistan’s Ministry of Economic Affairs has said that of the total $26.7 billion foreign loans, roughly 13% or only $3.4 billion has been allocated for project financing.

This small allocation towards project financing is indicative of the repayment challenges plaguing Pakistan economy . The majority of foreign borrowings at present support budgetary needs and foreign exchange reserves, neither of which generate funds for debt servicing.

. The majority of foreign borrowings at present support budgetary needs and foreign exchange reserves, neither of which generate funds for debt servicing. According to the Ministry of Finance, Pakistan's current debt-to-GDP ratio and gross financing requirements as a proportion of GDP have surpassed sustainable thresholds.

When gross financing requirements exceed 15% of GDP, it indicates an unsustainable position. Based on the Ministry of Finance's earlier estimates, Pakistan is expected to remain above this critical level for a minimum of three years ahead





Who Is Giving Loans to Pakistan?

Pakistan’s Poor Global Picture

Pakistan’s economy is deeply troubled, and its drowning in debt - its dependency on external support increasing every year. Pakistan got a record $26.7 billion in foreign loans in the previous fiscal year - a fact that clearly highlights its growing reliance on multilateral and bilateral lenders.Approximately 50% of these borrowings comprised refinancing of existing loans, PTI quoted a report from The Express Tribune saying.Also Read | Real economic blow to Pakistan! India chokes $500 million Pakistani goods entering it via third countries The Ministry of Economic Affairs has booked $11.9 billion in federal government accounts, exceeding the previous fiscal year by $1.2 billion.Whilst the IMF provided $2.1 billion, an additional $12.7 billion was secured through cash deposit rollovers from Saudi Arabia, China, the UAE, and Kuwait.Saudi Arabia has around $5 billion in cash deposits with the Pakistani central bank, with a 4% interest rate on the loans. These deposits have annual rollovers, because Pakistan is unable to repay.Even the IMF's three-year programme assumes a continuous rollover of the $12.7 billion loans. This raises concerns about the sustainability of external sector stability.Chinese deposits amount to $4 billion, carrying an interest rate of more than 6%.Additionally, China provided $484 million in guaranteed loans during the last fiscal year, which were predominantly utilised for asset acquisitions.The UAE has placed $3 billion with the Pakistan central bank.The finance ministry got $4.3 billion in commercial loans, which is majorly made up of refinanced Chinese loans and additional borrowings which are backed by Asian Development Bank (ADB) guarantees.The ADB provided $2.1 billion in new loans, above the budget by $500 million. The total contribution from multilateral institutions was $6.9 billion.The World Bank provided $1.7 billion, falling $300 million below the planned allocation, whilst not declaring any fresh budget support funding for the ongoing fiscal period.The Islamic Development Bank released $716 million in funds, whilst Saudi Arabia extended $200 million through an oil financing arrangement at a steep 6 per cent interest rate, rendering it a costly borrowing option.Also Read | India bleeds Pakistan dry: Water at ‘dead’ levels in Pakistan's dams; bigger Indus river plans in the works - top points to know According to the PTI report, Pakistan was unable to access international capital markets during last financial year, and their planned borrowing of $1 billion through Eurobonds and Panda bonds did not succeed.The government and central bank resorted to obtaining costly foreign commercial loans, supported by multilateral guarantees, to address the funding gap.Due to Pakistan's poor credit rating at junk level, the nation remains excluded from global capital markets and faces high interest rates for commercial loans and cash deposits.","Pakistan’s economy is deeply troubled, and its drowning in debt - its dependency on external support increasing every year.

On May 15, 1935, the Moscow Metro was inaugurated, marking the beginning of a transportation revolution. The first line from Sokolniki to Park Kultury, at 11.5 kilometres long with 13 stations, was completed in 3.5 years with a branch off to Smolenskaya. It initially transported 177,000 passengers before people became accustomed to travelling underground and riding the fast escalators. Whatever the case, over time, the metro became a symbol of resilience. It operated, except for one temporary closure on October 16, 1941, for the Great Patriotic War, and during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, we transported thousands of doctors to hospitals and essential services.Today, the Moscow Metro is a world-class system that transports over 8 million passengers daily and boasts the best on-time performance globally, with 99.9 per cent adherence and 90-second intervals during peak hours. More than 90 per cent of Muscovites now live within walking distance of a railway station. There has been tremendous growth in the system since 2010. From 182 stations, it now jumped to 302 stations1 in only 10 years, a leap compared to previous decades growing stations usually took over 40 years to achieve. The Moscow Metro is changing how people navigate the city, especially with the new lines like Nekrasovskaya, Troitskaya, and the upcoming Big Circle Line, In 2010, only 72 per cent of Moscow residents had easy access to the metro, but this is projected to be over 90 per cent by 2025!These innovations have changed the way people move around. In the past, almost all routes ended right in the heart of the city, but now, with new transfer points like the BCL, MCC, and suburban lines, millions can bypass the centre entirely. This not only saves time but also eases the burden on older lines. As a result, commuting in Moscow has become a much smoother, faster, and more efficient experience.The metro's impact goes beyond convenience and has meaningful economic impacts nationwide. Construction and expansion projects create demand for materials and equipment from all corners of Russia, involving over half a million tonnes of granite from the Urals or escalators from St Petersburg, creating long-term contracts and job security for hundreds of thousands of people. Greater than just train lines, integration with trams, MCD, MCC, and buses through unified ticketing and digital systems creates connections between neighbourhoods, stimulates local business, and repurposes the old industrial wasteland into vibrant neighbourhoods.Digital evolution is a hallmark of the travel experience. The Metro Moscow app, with 16 million downloads, has become an invaluable ally. Users can easily top up their Troika cards, buy trips, link bank and Muscovite cards, set up auto top-ups, and even transfer money between the cards! The app has launched Alexandra, the chatbot, which has fielded over 12 million requests. The latest enhancements include FPS support, virtual Troika, multimodal plans, and the ability to link with services such as Velobike. Passengers will hopefully see smart social cards with QR codes, as well as more surface transportation assistance, by 2025.The metro has indeed embraced the performative element of its role as an everyday cultural space, commissioning concerts, exhibits, and themed trains to inject some life into a quotidian routine. It also serves an essential purpose within our everyday schedules. Working residents are often transported; students and school children are taken to class; and tourists can reach almost all parts of the city. It keeps the city moving!Over the last 90 years, the Moscow Metro has grown with the city, from a small network around the city to a worldwide case study in transport. The network continues to grow, planning to add more than thirty stations by 2030. It serves a utilitarian purpose but also the ideas of agility, energy, and has consumer-friendly qualities that signify a progressive, urban doppelganger.","From 1935 to 2025, the Moscow Metro marks a historic milestone.

Asian markets surged on Wednesday, led by the rally in Japanese shares, after US President Donald Trump announced a trade deal with Japan that eased tariffs and boosted investor sentiments.Japan's Nikkei surged 2.6% on Wednesday, driven by a rally in automaker stocks after news that the auto tariff would be cut to 15% from a proposed 25%. Mazda Motor soared 17%, while Toyota rose 11%, reported the news agency Reuters.Meanwhile, Japanese government bonds fell, with 10-year yields jumping 8.5 basis points to 1.585%, as easing trade uncertainty opened the door for potential rate hikes by the Bank of Japan.The agreement includes a mellowed 15 percent tariff on Japanese exports to the US, as against the threatened 25 per cent. Trump announced the trade deal late on Tuesday.""We just completed a massive Deal with Japan, perhaps the largest Deal ever made,"" Trump announced on his Truth Social platform.""Japan will invest, at my direction, $550 Billion Dollars into the United States, which will receive 90% of the profits,"" he added.Trump did not provide further details on the investment plan, but claimed the deal ""will create hundreds of thousands of jobs.""Sentiments were further lifted by the additional deals announced with Indonesia and the Philippines, raising optimism that other countries would soon reach an agreement soon, leading to a broader trade relief amid tariff tension.

Market caution lingered as Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba was reportedly weighing whether to step down, depending on the trade deal's impact, according to the Yomiuri newspaper, according to Reuters.President Trump also said that EU representatives would arrive Wednesday for trade talks.With the agreement on car shipments secured, PM Ishiba said, “We are the first (country) in the world to reduce tariffs on automobiles and auto parts, with no limits on volume,” reported news agency AFP.While trade envoy Ryosei Akazawa posted on X - ""Mission accomplished.""However, he later clarified that the 50 percent tariffs on steel and aluminum were not included in the deal.Despite the deal, experts have issued caution. Stefan Angrick of Moody's Analytics warned it’s “unlikely to be the final chapter in a saga that has bruised Japan's economy,” reported AFP.“Japan's apparent 'win' is not that clear-cut; the country faced US tariffs in the low single digits before April and a 10 percent tariff since mid-April. It's unclear when the new tariff rate will take effect,” he wrote.Angrick added, “It's too early to assess the economic ramifications based on the superficial information available at the moment; the most that can be said at this point is that the 15 percent tariff is worse than what Japan had but better than what was threatened.”Meanwhile, US treasury secretary Scott Bessent announced plans to meet with his Chinese counterparts in Stockholm next week, ahead of a mid-August deadline when US tariffs on Beijing could increase again.While, across Asia, Hong Kong extended its 2025 rally to reach its highest level since late 2021.

Silicon shuttle: Is Jensen Huang the new Tim Cook for US-China relations?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/silicon-shuttle-is-jensen-huang-the-new-tim-cook-for-us-china-relations/articleshow/122839539.cms,"TL;DR: Driving the news

The Nvidia CEO secured US approval to resume sales of H20 AI chips to China, reversing a previous ban and safeguarding billions in revenue.

Huang has become a rare and effective intermediary between Washington and Beijing, using shuttle diplomacy to keep Nvidia in both markets.

The US chose to allow sales of less advanced chips to keep Chinese firms dependent on American technology, rather than ceding the market to Huawei.

Nvidia’s global importance has soared, with its chips powering AI worldwide and the company now valued at over $4 trillion.

“I don’t think I changed [Trump’s] mind,” Huang said. “It’s my job to inform the president about what I know very well, which is the technology industry, artificial intelligence, the developments of AI around the world”.

Why it matters

The big picture

Nvidia, now the world’s most valuable company at over $4 trillion, is at the heart of a new great power race: AI dominance.

Strategic leverage: Its chips fuel generative AI systems worldwide - including those built by Chinese firms that Washington fears could be repurposed for military uses.

Tightrope walk: The US wants to stay ahead technologically by curbing China’s access to the most advanced semiconductors. But it also doesn’t want to push China into full self-reliance - or let Huawei monopolize the world’s largest tech market.

Enter Huang: Unlike Apple, Nvidia’s business isn’t deeply embedded in Chinese supply chains. That gives Huang unusual room to maneuver - and to push back.

What they’re saying

“He’s a skillful CEO who… must navigate the China and non-China technology ecosystems,” Kurt Tong, former US consul general in Hong Kong and a partner at the Asia Group, told Bloomberg

“He makes the same argument, even where it is unpopular,” Brad Gerstner, CEO of Altimeter Capital and major Nvidia investor, told the NYT. “Because he believes… that winning developer mind-share in China and depriving Huawei of a monopoly market is the best way for American AI to win.""

“Technology leadership requires big markets,” Huang told reporters in Beijing, noting that China has “half the world’s AI researchers”

A reluctant player in a high-stakes game

Huang’s challenge is unlike any faced by his Silicon Valley peers. Apple’s Tim Cook rode a decade-long boom by embedding Apple deep into China’s supply chain and retail markets. Elon Musk, once treated like a rock star by Beijing, has faded from favor amid his public feuding with Trump and Tesla’s slipping China performance.

Huang’s approach? Strategic ambiguity. Maintain good standing with both Washington and Beijing. Say little. Smile often. Speak Mandarin when needed. Shake the right hands.

Zoom in: The Cook comparison

Like Cook during the Trump and Biden years, Huang is operating in a space where national security, trade, and technology policy blur.

Cook’s era: Apple’s China strategy delivered stunning financial results. Between 2012–2022, its profits in Greater China more than tripled.

But by 2023: iPhones were banned in Chinese government offices, Huawei roared back, and Cook’s access seemed to fade.

Now: Apple remains deeply reliant on Chinese suppliers - 4 of its top 20 - while Nvidia’s top 20 suppliers include none from China.

The Economist notes: “Mr. Huang is not Mr Cook. He may lack the Alabamian’s disarming lilt, but he seems more fluent both in MAGA and in Xi Jinping Thought.”

His statements - both in the US and China - are tailored for maximum compatibility:

To Trump: “Manufacturing in the United States wouldn’t have accelerated to this pace without the president’s strong encouragement.”

To Beijing: “AI research and development must be global, collaborative, and inclusive.”

What’s next

Just days after shaking hands with US President Donald Trump in the Oval Office, Jensen Huang was on stage in Beijing in his signature leather jacket, grinning as he greeted a Chinese audience in fluent Mandarin. On cue from a former Chinese commerce official, he struck an upbeat tone about shared futures and AI breakthroughs. Applause followed.What he didn’t say - but what everyone watching understood - was that Nvidia, the company he co-founded and now leads as CEO, had just pulled off a high-stakes diplomatic and commercial coup.The Trump administration, in an abrupt reversal, had approved the sale of Nvidia’s H20 chip to China, rescinding a ban that had threatened billions in revenue.Huang is fast emerging as a reluctant - and remarkably effective - emissary between Washington and Beijing. His cross-Pacific shuttle diplomacy has not only preserved Nvidia’s access to a $17 billion Chinese market, but it’s also made him the closest figure in today’s tech world to Tim Cook’s once-coveted role as corporate bridge between the world’s two superpowers.But this role comes with exponentially higher stakes.The H20 chip is less powerful than Nvidia’s flagship models, but still valuable to Chinese AI firms desperate for access to cutting-edge silicon. When the Trump administration quietly blocked its export this spring, it was a gut punch: Nvidia stood to lose $5.5 billion in potential sales. Huang, normally averse to political trench warfare, sprang into action.He testified before Congress, courted White House officials, and met directly with Trump. According to the New York Times, he argued that banning Nvidia’s chip would hand the market to Huawei and other Chinese rivals - undercutting US leadership in AI.Commerce secretary Howard Lutnick later echoed that logic publicly, saying the administration wanted Chinese developers “addicted to American technology,” even if that meant letting them buy older chips. It was a stunning reversal, and one that underscored Huang’s emerging role not just as a CEO, but as a geopolitical actor.“Huang is obviously on good terms with Trump administration. Yet his chip business is one of the biggest flashpoints between Beijing and Washington,” Feng Chucheng, a founding partner at Hutong Research, told Bloomberg.Huang, 62, didn’t seek out this role. He has long described himself as an engineer, not a politician. In January, while most of Silicon Valley's elite gathered in Washington for Trump’s inauguration, Huang was thousands of miles away, touring Nvidia’s Asia operations. That posture - politically agnostic, business-first - worked until his company’s chips became central to the US-China tech rivalry.Now, navigating that rivalry is part of his job. Nvidia, which controls more than 90% of the market for advanced AI chips, has become a critical player not just in the global tech economy, but in national security calculus on both sides of the Pacific.“He’s obviously on good terms with the Trump administration,” Feng Chucheng, founding partner of Hutong Research, told Bloomberg. “Yet his chip business is one of the biggest flashpoints between Beijing and Washington. It’s possible the two leaders may want such a channel for messaging, but is he willing to?”So far, Huang’s actions suggest he’s willing - up to a point.A Trump-Xi summit is widely expected later this year. Behind the scenes, the two sides are weighing broader trade-offs: easing chip controls, expanding rare earth supplies, and potentially extending US-China tech cooperation.The US commerce separtment’s move to reapprove Nvidia’s H20 chip sales came just as China agreed to supply rare earth magnets to American firms. Trump officials described the maneuver as a way to get Beijing “addicted to the American technology stack” while keeping US firms in control.Whether intentional or not, Huang helped deliver the talking points - and the outcome.“We can only influence them, inform them, do our best to provide them with facts,” Huang said modestly. “And then beyond that is out of our control”.(With inputs from agencies)","N Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has secured US approval to resume sales of H20 AI chips to China, reversing a previous ban.

General Motors reported a 35% year-on-year decline in second-quarter profit but managed to surpass Wall Street expectations and held firm on its full-year outlook that had been revised downward in May due to tariff-related headwinds.For the quarter ended June 30, GM posted a net profit of $1.89 billion, or $1.91 per share, compared to $2.93 billion, or $2.55 per share, in the same period last year. Stripping out certain items, adjusted earnings stood at $2.53 per share, comfortably beating analyst estimates of $2.34, according to FactSet.Revenue also slipped marginally to $47.12 billion from $47.97 billion, but still came in higher than Wall Street’s forecast of $45.84 billion. GM shares were down over 3% in premarket trade on Tuesday, AP reported.CEO Mary Barra, in a letter to shareholders, acknowledged the company’s tariff challenges, noting a $1.1 billion net impact from tariffs in the second quarter. She warned that the third quarter could see a higher impact, citing indirect costs related to trade policy. GM expects total gross tariff exposure of $4 billion to $5 billion in 2025.“Today’s announcement underpins our belief in America’s innovation in biopharmaceuticals,” Barra wrote, adding, “We are positioning the business for a profitable, long-term future as we adapt to new trade and tax policies, and a rapidly evolving tech landscape.”To mitigate the pressure, GM said it is making progress in offsetting at least 30% of its gross tariff exposure through targeted cost initiatives, manufacturing adjustments, and strategic pricing. The automaker had previously announced a $4 billion investment to shift production from Mexico to US plants—its largest domestic manufacturing commitment in recent years.Barra said the move was aimed at “greatly reducing our tariff exposure,” and that the company continues to leverage its domestic battery investments and flexible manufacturing footprint to maintain profitability.GM also reported electric vehicle (EV) sales of 46,300 units in Q2, up from 31,900 in Q1, even as overall EV market growth in the US shows signs of slowing. The $7,500 EV tax credit under the Inflation Reduction Act is set to expire for many models in September.“Despite slower EV industry growth, we believe the long-term future is profitable electric vehicle production, and this continues to be our north star,” Barra said, reaffirming GM’s EV strategy.GM maintained its full-year earnings forecast of adjusted EBIT between $10 billion and $12.5 billion, a guidance range lowered in May in anticipation of steep tariff impacts.The broader auto sector has been under strain due to President Donald Trump’s trade policies, which initially imposed 25% tariffs on auto imports. While Trump relaxed some of these duties in April, his administration has ordered a review into further levies on foreign-made vehicles and parts.According to the Center for Automotive Research, a uniform 25% tariff across all trading partners could cost the US auto industry an additional $107.7 billion, with Detroit’s Big Three automakers—GM, Ford and Stellantis—bearing $41.9 billion of that burden.The report came a day after Stellantis said it expects to post a €2.3 billion ($2.68 billion) net loss in H1 due to tariffs and other charges. Stellantis is scheduled to release its formal results on July 29.",General Motors reported a 35% year-on-year decline in second-quarter profit but managed to surpass Wall Street expectations.

US tech entrepreneur Bryan Johnson , known for his $2 million-a-year quest to reverse ageing, is now considering shutting down or selling his biotech company Blueprint, calling it a burden he no longer wants to carry.“Honestly, I am so close to either shutting it down or selling it,” Johnson said in an interview with American magazine Wired published Monday, adding, “I don’t need the money, and it’s a pain-in-the-a** company.”Blueprint, Johnson’s anti-ageing startup, markets itself as a system for longevity, offering supplements, biometric tests, and plant-based nutrition products like a $55 “longevity mix” and $42 mushroom coffee alternative called “Super Shrooms.”But despite the company’s bold pitch, Johnson now says the commercial venture is interfering with his broader ideological mission.Johnson believes running a health-focused company has undermined his credibility in advocating for what he sees as a deeper philosophical movement.“The problem is now people see the business and give me less credibility on the philosophy side,” he said in the interview. “I will not make that trade-off.It is not worth it to me. So yeah, I don’t want it”, he added.The 47-year-old launched Project Blueprint in 2021, an intensive anti-ageing regimen that includes dozens of daily supplements, strict calorie tracking, and sleep monitoring. At one point, Johnson transfused blood plasma from his teenage son, though he later stopped the practice, saying there were “no benefits detected.”Earlier this year, The New York Times reported that Blueprint was missing its monthly break-even point by at least $1 million, citing internal documents and interviews with staff.Johnson did not address the financial specifics in response to the Times, but said the report was inaccurate. “They painted it like we are in some kind of emergency financial situation. That is not the case,” he said. “We are break-even... We’ve had profitable months, we’ve had loss months.”Johnson also pushed back on criticisms of Blueprint’s use of confidentiality agreements. Multiple former employees, including a former fiancée, filed complaints with the National Labour Relations Board alleging overly restrictive NDAs.Johnson acknowledged the complaints but framed them in the context of his personal experiences with wealth. “When I made that money, I did not understand what it means to have money and how it fundamentally changes your relationship with the entire world,” he said.Aside from Blueprint, Johnson has turned his focus to a new project, launching a religion. In March, he announced the formation of “Don’t Die,” a movement aimed at redefining humanity’s existential priorities in an age of AI.As per Wired, the religion is rooted in a belief that the highest virtue is existence itself.“I’m not arguing for immortality. I’m not arguing for utopia,” he said. “We as a species, our existence is at risk... The single thing we have in common is that nobody wants to die right now. That’s it.”Johnson believes his message is incompatible with running a commercial venture. “Companies come and go. Religions have endured for millennia,” he said, adding that Blueprint started simply because friends asked for the supplements he was taking.Now, he says he’s ready to walk away.","US tech entrepreneur Bryan Johnson is now considering shutting down or selling his biotech company Blueprint, calling it a burden he no longer wants to carry.

Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground.Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change, too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

Explainer: What is 'Hindu rate of growth' and why Raghuram Rajan's remarks may be 'premature',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/explainer-what-is-hindu-rate-of-growth-and-why-raghuram-rajans-remarks-may-be-premature/articleshow/98482598.cms,"What is meant by Hindu growth rate

How India's GDP has been growing

What SBI report said on savings and investment

Incremental capital output ratio

NEW DELHI: India's gross domestic product (GDP) data for the third quarter (October-December 2022) received a word of caution from the former Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Raghuram Rajan In an interview with news agency PTI, Rajan that India is ""dangerously close"" to the Hindu rate of growth in view of subdued private sector investment, high interest rates and slowing global growth.India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%.Rajan termed this sequential slowdown in growth as ""worrying"".However, a report released by the State Bank of India (SBI) economists on Tuesday dismissed arguments that India is dangerously close to Hindu rate of growth saying such statements are ""ill-conceived, biased and premature"".The term 'Hindu growth rate' was coined by late economist Raj Krishna in 1978 to describe the slow growth in the country.It basically refers to the low pace of economic growth rates during 1950s to 1980s. During this period, the Indian economy averaged 3.5%.A former lecturer at the Delhi School of Economics (DSE), Krishna noted that only if the rate of growth is persistently slow and accompanied by low per-capita GDP, then it will be known as Hindu rate of growth but it has to factor in population growth as well.Before economic reforms of 1991, India's economic growth remained stagnant and low, while per capita income averaged around 1.3%. Krishna termed this low growth situation to be a result of socialist policies of state control and import substitution.However, the economic situation changed when liberalisation, privatisation and globalisation (LPG) reforms came into effect in the year 1991, at a time when India faced balance of payment crisis.Over the years, many economists have strongly opposed the idea of 'Hindu growth rate' and the term never had universal acceptance.The Indian economy plunged into its very first technical recession in FY21 due to the impact of Covid-19 pandemic and the related nationwide lockdowns. GDP shrunk by an unprecedented 23.8% in the first quarter of the financial year 2020-21. However, due to spurt in economic activities in the subsequent quarters, the GDP decline started to narrow.However, if we look at the period before Covid-19 as well, India's growth curve shows a declining trend.From 8.26% in FY17, GDP growth plunged to 3.74% in FY20. Shutdown of economic activities in FY21 in wake of Covid-19 only made matters worse.As lockdowns started to ease and business activities resumed, India's GDP also started rising. In Q1 of FY22, growth jumped to 20.1% mainly on account of low base effect. By the fourth quarter of FY22, growth came down to 4.10%.Similarly, the new financial year 2022-23 brought fresh economic challenges in the form of Russia-Ukraine war that impacted almost all major economies of the world, slowed the pace of growth, pushed inflation to record highs.As a result, the central banks of all advanced economies spurred into action and opted for monetary policy tightening to curb the soaring inflation.With persistently rising interest rates, India's economy grew by 4.4% in Q3 of FY23, as the Centre revised upwards GDP growth for previous year to 9.10% from 8.7% earlier.The report weighed recent GDP numbers against the available data on savings and investments for the past decade and highlighted some interesting points.""Quarterly growth numbers are noisy and should be best avoided for any serious interpretation (on an average, India's GDP growth has witnessed Rs 2 lakh crore upward revision for the 3 year ended FY23),"" the report said.Gross capital formation (GCF) by the government touched a high of 11.8% in 2021-22, up from 10.7% in 2020-21.""This also had a domino effect on private sector investment that jumped from 10 per cent to 10.8% over the same period,"" it said.In fact, Ecowrap added that the trends in GCF to gross output ratio or the plough back of funds for creation of fresh capacity shows that for public administration the ratio attained fresh peak in 2021-22 owing to the emphasis on capital expenditure in recent budgets.At the aggregate level, gross capital formation is supposed to have crossed 32% in 2022-23, the highest level since 2018-19.According to the report, in 2021-22, gross savings have risen to 30% from 29% in 2020-21.""The ratio is supposed to have crossed 31 per cent in 2022-23, the highest since 2018-19. The household savings increased sharply during the pandemic period on account of sharp accretion in financial savings such as deposits,"" said the report by SBI's Economic Research Department.While household financial savings have since then moderated from 15.4% in 2020-21 to 11.1% in 2022-23, savings in physical assets have grown sharply to 11.8% in 2021-22 from 10.7% in 2020-21.The report further analysed Incremental Capital Output ratio (ICOR) -- which measures additional units of capital (investment) needed to produce additional units of output. It said that the ratio has been improving.""ICOR which was 7.5 in FY 12 is now only 3.5 in FY22. Clearly, only half of capital is now needed for next unit of output,"" the report noted.Such reducing ICOR in the current years reflects a relatively increasing efficiency of capital and shows that the economy is on a sound footing, the report said.""From that point of view, future GDP growth rates even at 7% could still mean a decent number by any standards!,"" it added.","India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%.

An employee is entitled for a 50 per cent amount of the last drawn salary as pension.OPS was discontinued by the NDA government in 2003 with effect from April 1, 2004.Under the new pension scheme (NPS), employees contribute 10 per cent of their basic salary towards pension while the government contributes 14 per cent.Governments of Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand have informed the central government/ Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA about their decision to restart OPS for their employees.The government of Punjab on November 18, 2022, issued a notification regarding implementation of OPS for the state government employees who are being covered under NPS. Jharkhand too has decided to revert to OPS.",Former RBI governor Raghuram Rajan has expressed his concern over the decision of some states to restart the old pension scheme.

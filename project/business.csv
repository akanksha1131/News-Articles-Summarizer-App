When should you exit an investment? Top things to keep in mind,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/investing/when-should-you-exit-an-investment-top-things-to-keep-in-mind/articleshow/119410980.cms,"Here are key scenarios where exiting an investment may be advisable.

By Sandeep Walunj

""If the job has been correctly done when a common stock is purchased, the time to sell it is – almost never."" – Philip Fisher

""You may not know when to start but must know when to stop!""

Here are key scenarios where exiting an investment may be advisable:

1. Achievement of Goals

Did you invest with a clear goal—retirement, buying a house, or funding education? If so, exit when the goal nears.

Shift to less volatile asset classes as the exit date approaches to minimize risks.

2. Profit Booking

Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio – If significantly above historical or sector averages, it may indicate overvaluation. Price-to-Book (P/B) Ratio – A high ratio may signal overvaluation relative to intrinsic worth. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis – If the stock price has reached its fair value based on future cash flows, exiting may be prudent.

Reinvest proceeds wisely and consider tax implications.

During a market rally, sell in tranches to secure gains while retaining exposure.

3.

Stop-Loss Strategy

A stop-loss order sets a predetermined exit point to limit losses.

Example: If a stock is bought at ₹100 with a 10% stop-loss, sell it at ₹90, preventing larger losses.

Set stop-loss levels based on investment type—example 5-15% for volatile stocks, 15-25% for stable blue-chip stocks—aligned with your risk tolerance.

4. Underperformance

Mutual Funds – If it lags behind category peers and benchmarks persistently.

Stocks – Red flags include:

Declining revenues and profits. Rising debt levels. Loss of market leadership. Governance issues (e.g., fraud, regulatory troubles).



5. Portfolio Rebalancing

A well-diversified portfolio needs periodic rebalancing.

If an asset class grows disproportionately large, reduce exposure and reinvest in underweighted assets.

Example: If equities surge, selling some stocks and reallocating to bonds can maintain balance.

6. Market and Economic Conditions

Rising Interest Rates – Sectors like real estate and capital-intensive industries may underperform in this scenario.

Recession Indicators – An inverted yield curve or declining consumer spending may warrant exiting cyclical stocks.

Regulatory Changes – New laws, tax policies, or sectoral regulations can impact profitability.

Behavioural Biases That Delay Exit Decisions

Loss Aversion – Refusing to sell at a loss, hoping for recovery instead of reallocating capital.

Confirmation Bias – Ignoring negative signals and focusing only on positive news.

Anchoring Bias – Fixating on past high prices and resisting selling below that level.

"Gratuity eligibility, payout and formula: Leaving job before 5 years? Here’s how you can still get gratuity",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/savings/gratuity-eligibility-payout-and-formula-leaving-job-before-5-years-heres-how-you-can-still-get-gratuity/articleshow/119248440.cms,"Gratuity payment calculations are governed by specific guidelines outlined in the Payment of Gratuity Act. (AI image)

How is gratuity payment calculated? Formula explained

The calculation method is: (15X Final drawn salary X Service duration)/26

The computation would be: (15X40,000X5)/26.

The gratuity amount due to Mis X is Rs 1,15,384.61, rounded to Rs 1,15,385.

For staff not under the Payment of Gratuity Act's purview:

The computation for his gratuity proceeds as: (15X40,000X6)/30.

The final gratuity amount that Mr X shall receive is Rs 1,20,000.

Salaried employees quite often have gratuity as a component of their CTC (cost to company). The Payment of Gratuity Rules, 1972, stipulates that staff members become entitled to gratuity after completing five years of uninterrupted service with an organisation. But, did you know that you can qualify for gratuity payout before completing five years, provided they serve beyond a particular duration.According to an ET report, experts say that employees qualify for gratuity upon completing 4 years and 240 days with an organisation. For example, if someone began working at an organisation on January 1, 2021, they would be eligible for gratuity upon leaving after August 29, 2025. This eligibility occurs because they would have served 4 years and 240 days by then, although their five-year milestone would only be completed by January 1, 2026.This provision exists because of how continuous service is defined in the Payment of Gratuity Act Puneet Gupta, Tax Partner, EY India, told ET, ""Section 4(1) of the Payment of Gratuity Act says that gratuity will be payable if an employee has rendered a minimum continuous service of five years. Section 2A of the Payment of Gratuity Act defines continuous service. Section 2A(2) of the Gratuity Act defines the deemed-to-be in continuous service. An employee is deemed to be in continuous service for one year if an employee during the 12 preceding calendar months has worked under the employer for not less than 190 days or 240 days, as the case may be.""Also Read | Tax planning before March 31 deadline? Tax saving fixed deposits with high interest rates - check list According to the Payment of Gratuity Act, employees working in underground mines or establishments operating fewer than six days weekly must complete 190 days, whilst others need 240 days. When an employee completes more than 240 days in the fifth year, they are considered to have completed an additional year of service, totalling five years, thus becoming eligible for gratuity.Saraswathi Kasturirangan, Partner at Deloitte India explains that an employee on payroll becomes eligible for gratuity payment upon completing 4 years and 240 days of service when leaving the organisation. The 240-day period is equivalent to 7.89 months. Therefore, workers should ensure their tenure extends to 4 years and 8 months to qualify for gratuity benefits upon resignation or retirement, she says. Consequently, staff members whose continuous service falls short of 4 years and 240 days, for instance, those departing after 4 years and 6 months or 4 years, 6 months and 1 day, cannot claim gratuity benefits, she notes.The requirement of five years' continuous service is waived if the employee's service ends due to death or disablement.Gratuity payment calculations are governed by specific guidelines outlined in the Payment of Gratuity Act. The calculation method varies depending on whether employees fall under the Act's purview or not.Also Read | Gold prices at record high! Have yellow metal prices peaked? Check these 5 charts before putting more money in gold The Act's applicability is determined by the organisation's workforce size. If an organisation has employed 10 or more people on any single day within the previous 12 calendar months, it comes under the Act's jurisdiction. Once covered, the organisation remains subject to the Act even if staff numbers subsequently decrease below 10.For staff members covered by the Payment of Gratuity Act, the payment is calculated using 15 days of their final drawn salary for each full year of service, including any period exceeding six months.The final drawn salary encompasses basic pay, dearness allowance and sales commission, as stipulated in the Act.Consider Miss X who has served an organisation (with a six-day work week) for 4 years and 300 days. Her eligibility for gratuity payment is confirmed as her service exceeds 4 years and 240 days. With a final basic salary of Rs 40,000, the 300 days convert to 9.863 months. For gratuity calculations, when excess months exceed 6 (9 months here), it counts as one complete year.Also Read | New TDS rules from April 1, 2025: Check new tax deduction limits for FD interest, MFs and lottery wins Gratuity remains payable even when organisations aren't covered by the Payment of Gratuity Act. In such instances, the gratuity is calculated as half a month's salary per completed service year, disregarding any incomplete year (months less than a year) in the calculation.The gratuity calculation follows this equation: (15 X Last drawn salary X Number of years of completed service)/30.Consider a scenario where Mr X has served an organisation (not under the Act's purview) for 6 years and 7 months. His final basic salary stands at Rs 40,000, and the organisation opts to provide him with gratuity.","Salaried employees often have gratuity as a component of their CTC (cost to company) The Payment of Gratuity Rules, 1972, stipulates that staff members become entitled to gratuity after completing five years of uninterrupted service with an organisation.

BSE Sensex, Nifty50 rally: Why stock market rose today

1) Return of Foreign Investment

2) Strengthening Economic Indicators

3) Declining U.S. Treasury yields

4) Technical indicator

Stock market today : BSE Sensex and Nifty50, the Indian equity benchmark indices, rallied strongly in trade on Monday. While the BSE Sensex went above 78,100 level, Nifty50 crossed 23,700 intraday. BSE Sensex ended the day at 77,984.38, up 1,079 points or 1.40%. Nifty50 ended at 23,658.35, up 308 points or 1.32%.The key stock market indices continued their upward momentum for the sixth straight session on Monday, as the Sensex soared beyond 1,000 points whilst the Nifty50 finished above 23,650, supported by strong performance in banking and energy sectors amidst overseas investment inflows and value buying.The BSE Sensex climbed 1,079 points, or 1.4%, to end at 77,984, whilst the Nifty50 gained 308 points, or 1.32%, to finish at 23,658.The aggregate market value of companies listed on the BSE increased by Rs 5.2 lakh crore to reach Rs 418.49 lakh crore, according to an ET reportForeign Institutional Investors (FIIs) have shifted to net buyers in three out of four recent sessions, boosting market confidence, following months of continuous selling. FIIs acquired equities worth Rs 7,470 crore on March 21, indicating a notable change in their position.""Recent activity shows a change in FII strategy in India. The intensity of FII selling had started declining earlier. The recent reversal in FII selling has turned the market sentiments for the better, facilitating a rally in the market,"" said Dr. VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Investment Services.Indian markets are advancing despite worldwide worries about potential U.S. tariffs becoming effective from April 2. Robust domestic economic indicators and reasonable valuations have motivated FIIs to transition from selling to buying positions. This transformation has resulted in substantial short covering, causing rapid price increases.""The uncanny ability of the market to surprise was evident last week when the Nifty surged by 4.6% in a week. This happened despite global markets being jittery over fears of Trump's reciprocal tariffs. Improving macros of the Indian economy and fair valuations have turned FIIs into buyers, triggering massive short covering. Even though the undertone of the market is bullish investors have to be careful. April 2nd- the reciprocal tariffs day- is looming large and the uncertainty surrounding that is huge,"" said Vijayakumar.The reduction in U.S. Treasury yields has bolstered Indian equity markets. The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield has seen a decrease of approximately 40 basis points from its peak in mid-February, now resting at 4.27%. The lower yields enhance the appeal of emerging markets, including India, leading investors to reallocate their funds from U.S. equities.The market's bullish momentum has been strengthened by positive technical indicators. The Nifty displayed a strong white-body Marubozu candle in its weekly chart, largely recovering from February's declines. The index surpassed significant resistance points, ending above the 20DEMA, 50DEMA, and 89DEMA within a single week.Angel One reports that Nifty has conclusively broken through a Falling Channel pattern, indicating a directional change. The RSI Smoothened has exceeded its previous swing high of 60, corresponding with the price breakthrough at 23,800. This movement, combined with a new buy crossover on the weekly timeline, indicates potential targets at 23,800 and 24,000, in line with the 200DSMA.Angel One cautions that subsequent market advances may proceed at a slower pace, possibly featuring choppy or consolidating movements. They recommend traders maintain an optimistic outlook, viewing downturns as opportunities to buy, whilst recognising 23,200 and 23,000 as substantial support levels.","BSE Sensex and Nifty50, the Indian equity benchmark indices, rallied strongly in trade on Monday.

The industry body has sought an MDR of 0.3% on UPI transactions only for large merchants and a nominal MDR on RuPay debit cards for all merchants. “This approach aligns with existing MDR structures for other digital payments instruments such as credit cards and non RuPay debit cards,” PCI said in a statement on Monday.MDR is a fee charged by banks to merchants for providing digital payment services. The government last week approved a lower Rs 1,500 crore incentive scheme for the current financial year to promote low-value BHIM-UPI transactions, focusing on payments made to merchants. The allocation was half of the over Rs 3,000 crore subsidy in FY24. PCI in the letter said that the Rs 1,500 crore allocation covers only a fraction of the estimated Rs 10,000 crore annual cost required to maintain and expand UPI services. “MDR is the lifeline of the digital payments ecosystem. Without it, the sustainability of the entire infrastructure is at risk. The introduction of a reasonable MDR for large merchant transactions will allow the industry to continue investing in innovation, cybersecurity, grievance redressal, and merchant support, ultimately ensuring that UPI continues to thrive,” PCI said in its submission. About six crore merchants in India currently accept digital payments of which 90% are categorised as small merchants with around 50 lakh merchants categorised as large enterprises.Introduction of MDR on UPI merchant transactions has been a long pending demand of the fintech and broader payments industry which said that a zero MDR regime would render the system unsustainable. Amazon Pay, PhonePe, Paytm and Razorpay are among members of PCI.","The Payments Council of India (PCI) has written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

Although 2% levy garnered more criticism from the US, in anticipation of more tariff retaliation by US, govt is trying to show a more accommodative stance and removal of 6% equalisation levy on online advertising is a step in that direction,"" said Amit Maheshwari, tax partner at consulting firm AKM Global.Deloitte India partner Sumit Singhania said the move is in sync with endeavour to simplify the law. ""Even from an international tax policy standpoint, most of the unilateral measures undertaken by govts around the globe in last several years to deal with tax challenges of digitalisation of economies have to be steadily wound back, to make way for uniform tax rules under two pillar solutions espoused by OECD. Given the context that preceded enactment of equalisation levy, this would be a progressive policy move to restore higher degree of certainty to taxpayers impacted by the levy,"" he said. Govt has also proposed amendments to make offshore fund investments less taxing and sought Parliamentary nod for changes related to tax assessments under search and seizure provisions and reconciliation of I-T returns.""Key amendment is the replacement of term 'total income' with 'total undisclosed income'. In Finance Act 2024, when block assessment regime for search & seizure cases was introduced, 'total income' was used. This has caused concerns that in case of taxpayers facing search & seizure proceedings, even disclosed income will be subject to penalties. Now, govt has added a term 'total undisclosed income' to clarify that target is to penalise undisclosed income only,"" Maheshwari said.",The move is part of the amendments proposed by FM Nirmala Sitharaman.

FIR against Kamra



Opposition support



NEW DELHI: Comedian Kunal Kamra on Sunday sparked controversy after he took a jibe at Maharashtra deputy chief minister Eknath Shinde during a show in Mumbai.The incident drew a sharp response from Shiv Sena (Shinde faction) workers who went on to vandalise the venue where Kamra performed.During his stand-up show, Kamra performed a parody of a popular Hindi song from ""Dil To Pagal Hai,"" referring to Shinde as a ""gaddar"" (traitor). He also made jokes about recent political developments in Maharashtra, including party splits within Shiv Sena and NCP.“Meri nazar se tum dekho to gaddar nazar wo aaye. Haaye,"" Kunal Kamra said during his show.""Shiv Sena first came out of the BJP, then Shiv Sena came out of Shiv Sena. NCP came out of NCP, they gave nine buttons to one voter... everyone got confused,"" he added.According to police officials, Shiv Sena workers vandalized Hotel Unicontinental in Mumbai’s Khar area, where Kamra's show with the 'gaddar' (traitor) jibe at Eknath Shinde was filmed. They also sought an FIR against him.AN FIR was registered against Shiv Sena Yuva Sena general secretary Rahool Kanal and 19 others for vandalising the Habitat standup comedy set under various sections of BNS and Maharashtra Police Act.Shiv Sena MLA Murji Patel filed an FIR against Kamra and issued an ultimatum, demanding an apology within two days. Patel threatened to restrict Kamra's movement in Mumbai and promised to raise the issue in the assembly.""We have filed an FIR against Kunal Kamra for his comments against our leader and Maharashtra's DCM Eknath Shinde. We have demanded quick action against him. I want to tell him to apologize to Eknath Shinde within two days, otherwise, Shiv Sainiks will not let him move about freely in Mumbai,"" Patel said.""If he is seen anywhere in public, we will paint his face black... We will take up this issue in the assembly and request our state's home minister to order action against him as soon as possible,"" he added.Party leaders dismissed Kamra as a ""hired comedian"" making comments for money.""Kunal Kamra is a hired comedian, and he is making comments on our leader for some money. Let alone Maharashtra, Kunal Kamra cannot freely go anywhere in India; Shiv Sainiks will show him his place. We feel sorry for Sanjay Raut and Shiv Sena (UBT) that they have no party workers or leaders left to make comments on our leader, which is why they are hiring people like him (Kunal Kamra) for the job,"" Mhaske said.The opposition, particularly Shiv Sena (UBT), defended Kamra and condemned the attack. Aaditya Thackeray called the vandalism an act of cowardice by ""Mindhe's gang"" and questioned the state's law and order situation.""Mindhe's (read Shinde) coward gang breaks the comedy show stage where comedian Kunal Kamra put out a song on Eknath Mindhe, which was 100 percent true.

Stocks rose in morning trading (US local time) as Wall Street attempts to navigate uncertainty amid an ongoing trade war . The S&P 500 jumped 1.1%, coming off its first winning week after a four-week losing streak. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.7%, while the Nasdaq composite gained 1.5%.Wall Street remains focused on how tariffs could impact inflation, consumer spending, and overall economic growth.Stocks have been subject to volatility as tariffs are announced, then either implemented or retracted. Meanwhile, genetics testing company 23andMe plunged after announcing it had initiated voluntary bankruptcy proceedings over the weekend.According to AP, Wall Street was sharply higher before the opening bell on Monday, as the momentum from last week carried over into the new trading week. Futures for the S&P 500 surged 1.1%, while Dow Jones Industrial Average futures rose 0.9%, and Nasdaq futures climbed 1.4%.Investors focused on corporate news while awaiting updates on US President Donald Trump ’s tariffs, which have caused significant market fluctuations in recent weeks. Genetics testing company 23andMe saw its shares drop nearly 42% in premarket trading after revealing it had initiated voluntary bankruptcy proceedings. The company had laid off nearly half of its staff last fall and was winding down clinical trials while assessing ""strategic alternatives"" for certain assets.Meanwhile, shares in The AZEK Co. surged 20% before the bell on Monday after the building materials company announced it would be acquired by Australia's James Hardie Industries in a cash-and-stock deal valued around $8.75 billion. This marked the second large deal in the sector within a week, following QXO Inc.'s announcement on Thursday that it was purchasing Beacon Roofing Supply Inc. for around $11 billion, including debt.Regarding tariffs, reports suggest President Trump may narrow his broad approach focusing specifically on countries with significant trade surpluses with the US, particularly in Asia. Markets have faced turbulence this year, reacting to each new tariff announcement.The ongoing trade war between the US and its key trading partners poses a threat to inflation and could negatively impact both consumers and businesses. Trump has set an April 2 deadline for implementing additional tariffs on trading partners, following previous deadlines that were often postponed or canceled at the last minute.Chinese Premier Li Qiang struck a conciliatory tone in a meeting with business leaders and US Senator Steve Daines, the first US congressman to visit Beijing since Trump took office in January. Li emphasized the importance of dialogue over confrontation, calling for win-win cooperation over zero-sum competition. The meeting also included leaders from major US businesses such as FedEx Corp., Boeing Co., Qualcomm, and Pfizer.AP’s report also highlighted that recent statements from Trump administration officials suggest that the list of affected countries may not be as broad as initially expected, and existing tariffs, such as those on steel, may not be cumulative. This has sparked optimism in the markets that Trump’s tariff plans may ultimately be less impactful than previously feared.In international markets, Hong Kong's Hang Seng gained 0.4% to 23,787.71, and the Shanghai Composite Index rose 0.2% to 3,370.03. In Tokyo, the Nikkei 225 slipped 0.2% to 37,608.49 following a preliminary report showing the fastest pace of manufacturing output decline in a year, accompanied by a sharp drop in new orders.

India has played a vital role in the impressive growth of California almonds , with 85% of almonds consumed in the country coming from California.Emily Fleischmann, Vice President of Global Market Development at the Almond Board of California (ABC), highlighted India’s contribution to the success of California almonds. India is the largest export market for California almonds, and in the 2023-24 crop year, shipments to India exceeded 400 million pounds, marking a 21% growth compared to the previous year.Fleischmann shared that almonds have become an integral part of daily life in India, whether soaked overnight for children or consumed as a healthy snack by adults. The belief that almonds enhance mental sharpness has also created a unique dynamic in the Indian market.""India has played a critical role in the growth story of California almonds, and the numbers speak for themselves — from 100 million pounds of consumption a decade ago to now over 400 million pounds. California represents 85% of the market share of almonds in India,"" she said in an interview with new agency PTI.In the 2023-24 crop year, California produced 76% of the world’s almonds, with Australia and Spain following behind at 7% each. Other almond-growing countries include Turkey (2%) and Italy, Portugal, Morocco, China, Chile, and Tunisia, each at 1%.Despite being California’s largest export market, Fleischmann emphasized that India’s growth potential for almonds remains substantial. India's per capita almond consumption stands at 0.46 pounds, far below the top-consuming countries like the USA, Germany, and Italy, where consumption exceeds two pounds per capita.The Almond Board is focusing on expanding its reach, particularly in tier II and tier III cities, where 66% of India’s growth is expected over the next decade. The board is promoting almonds in various forms, such as flour, milk, and other products, in response to India’s growing demand for healthy snacking options.Fleischmann also acknowledged the importance of diversifying markets to ensure balanced growth. While India is a primary focus, the ABC is also expanding into other global markets, including Europe, South Korea, Japan, China, Mexico, and emerging markets like Morocco, Turkey, Indonesia, Pakistan, and South Africa.The ABC, a non-profit organization established in 1950, represents over 7,600 almond growers and 100 processors in California. It promotes California almonds both domestically and internationally through marketing, research, and sustainable farming practices.","India is the largest export market for California almonds.

The price of Brexit: How much is leaving the EU costing UK businesses?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/the-price-of-brexit-how-much-is-leaving-the-eu-costing-uk-businesses/articleshow/119371467.cms,"Representative image

The UK is paying a heavy financial price for Brexit, with new data revealing a significant blow to trade with the European Union . As a result, the government has announced plans to eliminate obstacles hampering trade in an effort to mitigate the economic damage.As per recent figures—official estimates show that Brexit is costing UK businesses £37 billion annually due to reduced trade with the EU, according to report by UK newspaper Independent. According to data presented by UK trade minister Douglas Alexander, UK-EU trade for the period ending September last year was 5 per cent lower than in 2018, when adjusted for inflation and excluding precious metals. This figure comes from calculations by the House of Commons library.Alexander put the blame on the previous Conservative government's Brexit agreement for the substantial losses, declaring that it is ""clear [the agreement] is not working well enough."" He outlined the Labour government's commitment to rebuilding economic ties with the EU and removing unnecessary trade barriers to stimulate growth.The financial loss was highlighted during a parliamentary question from SNP MP Stephen Gethins, who described it as ""an appalling loss of trade at a time when business and the Exchequer can ill afford it."" Gethins criticized the government's ongoing adherence to a ""hard Tory Brexit,"" arguing that it worsens economic conditions while imposing cuts that harm the most vulnerable. ""A hard Brexit makes us poorer and less secure,"" Gethins warned. ""The government must stop punching down on the most vulnerable to balance the books and join the customs union and single market at the very least.""The burden of post-Brexit bureaucracy has also been substantial. The Independent recently reported that Brexit-related paperwork is so extensive it could circle the globe 15 times. David Henig, from the European Centre for International Political Economy, directly linked the trade decline to Brexit and urged the government to address regulatory differences that are causing friction.Mike Galsworthy of European Movement UK questioned the rationale for excluding the single market, customs union, and free movement, arguing these were not mandated by the 2016 referendum. Meanwhile, Tom Brufatto from Best for Britain suggested that closer alignment with the EU could increase the UK economy by 2.2 per cent, and called for policies to reduce trade friction ahead of the upcoming UK-EU summit in May.","UK-EU trade for the period ending September last year was 5 per cent lower than in 2018, when adjusted for inflation and excluding precious metals.

Trump’s trade war is also fueling a second wave of the “China Shock,” a term used by economists to describe the massive economic disruption caused by China’s rise as a manufacturing powerhouse in the early 2000s. Now, as Trump closes the door on Chinese imports, those products are flooding global markets—leading to economic distress in countries from Indonesia to Mexico.

India in the crosshairs: India is feeling the heat. Authorities in New Delhi have launched anti-dumping probes into a range of Chinese products, including solar cells and mobile phone components, to shield domestic industries. Meanwhile, local textile producers are struggling to compete against a flood of inexpensive Chinese garments.

India is feeling the heat. Authorities in New Delhi have launched anti-dumping probes into a range of Chinese products, including solar cells and mobile phone components, to shield domestic industries. Meanwhile, local textile producers are struggling to compete against a flood of inexpensive Chinese garments. The situation in India mirrors what is happening in Mexico and Southeast Asia. As per the Bloomberg report, in Mexico, President Claudia Sheinbaum has linked rising violence in industrial regions to mass layoffs caused by the influx of Chinese goods. “So much of the entry of Chinese products into Mexico caused this industry to fall in our country,” Sheinbaum said.

Indonesia's textile and apparel industry has shed around 250,000 jobs over the past two years, with an additional 500,000 positions projected to be at risk by 2025. This trend would amount to losing roughly one in four industry jobs within just a few years. The pace of these job losses surpasses the so-called ""China Shock,"" during which the US lost as many as 2.4 million jobs between 1999 and 2011.

Thailand has imposed a value-added tax on low-cost Chinese imports. Sanan Angubolkul, the head of Thailand’s Chamber of Commerce, warned that the situation is “very critical, and there’s no time to waste” as the nation deals with a surge of electrical appliances, clothing and other Chinese goods, the Bloomberg report said .

Vietnam has ordered Chinese e-commerce giants to suspend operations.

In Indonesia, garment manufacturers are struggling to compete with cheap Chinese textiles. The Indonesia Fiber and Filament Yarn Producer Association estimates that one in four jobs in the sector could disappear this year.

What they’re saying

Trump’s latest trade moves have sparked strong reactions from business leaders, economists, and government officials:

Donald Trump, on trade negotiations: “We have a powerful group of partners in trade. Again, we can’t let those partners treat us badly… The ones that wouldn’t be as friendly to us in some cases treat us better than the ones that are supposed to be friendly.”

Howard Lutnick, US commerce Ssecretary: “These policies are the most important thing America has ever had… It is worth it.”

Henrietta Treyz, economic analyst: “Markets remain skittish because this isn’t just about China anymore. Trump’s April 2 tariffs will hit everyone.”

Brian Coulton, Fitch chief economist: “Tariff hikes will result in higher US consumer prices, reduce real wages, and increase companies’ costs.”

""This is China Shock 2.0 or China Shock 3.0. China has this immense manufacturing capacity, and the goods have to go somewhere"" Gordon Hanson, a professor of urban policy at the Harvard Kennedy School, told Bloomberg.

Zoom In: India’s trade battle

India, which is both a competitor and a partner to China, faces unique challenges in this trade war:

The country’s automotive, chemical, and electronics sectors have benefited from Trump’s tariffs on China, as US firms seek alternative suppliers.

However, India also imports heavily from China, meaning that any trade barriers on Chinese goods could raise costs for Indian manufacturers.

Trump’s demand for reciprocal tariffs puts India in a difficult position. If India refuses, it risks losing access to the lucrative US market. But if it complies, domestic industries—especially agriculture and small businesses—could suffer.

What’s next

As the April 2 tariff deadline approaches, several key developments could shape the outcome:

India’s concessions: The Modi government is in talks to lower more tariffs, but it remains unclear if these moves will be enough to satisfy Trump.

China’s retaliation: If China feels further cornered, it could step up its trade offensive, worsening the economic fallout for other countries.

Global recession fears: Economists warn that escalating trade tensions could push the world closer to a recession, with inflation rising and investment slowing.

The bottom line

US President Donald Trump is escalating his global trade war, targeting not just China but also allies like India. As part of his ""America First"" economic strategy, Trump announced that India will face reciprocal tariffs starting April 2, claiming that the country imposes some of the highest duties on US goods.Meanwhile, his crackdown on Beijing is triggering a new ""China Shock,"" as excess Chinese exports flood global markets, disrupting industries and destroying jobs worldwide, a Bloomberg report said. The world’s largest exporter, facing increased trade barriers in the US, is flooding other markets with cheap goods—undercutting local manufacturers and eliminating jobs from Mexico to Indonesia to India.In an interview with Breitbart News, Trump said that while India is a “wonderful nation,” it has tariffs that are unfair to the US. “I have a very good relationship with India, but the only problem I have is they’re one of the highest tariffing nations in the world,” he said. “I believe they’re going to probably be lowering those tariffs substantially, but on April 2, we will be charging them the same tariffs they charge us.”On China, Trump is taking an even more aggressive stance, arguing that Beijing’s economic expansion is hurting American workers and destabilizing industries worldwide. His latest tariffs are designed to curb China’s influence, but they are also causing widespread disruptions in other economies that rely on trade with China.The economic fallout is already visible in Southeast Asia, where Chinese exports—redirected from the US due to tariffs—are undercutting local businesses.Trump’s tariff war is not just a US-China showdown—it’s reshaping global trade patterns, forcing countries like India to make tough choices and wreaking havoc on emerging markets:While Prime Minister Narendra Modi has cultivated strong ties with Trump, India is scrambling to reduce trade tensions. In recent weeks, it has lowered duties on bourbon, high-end motorcycles, and certain agricultural goods. More tariff reductions could follow as Indian officials work to avoid a full-scale trade war with the US.With US import barriers rising, Chinese manufacturers are aggressively seeking new markets. The result? An oversupply of Chinese goods in countries like Indonesia, Mexico, and Brazil, putting pressure on local producers.A global economic risk: Trump’s tariffs have already rattled markets. As April 2 approaches, uncertainty is growing, with investors worried about inflation and supply chain disruptions. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell recently noted, “Uncertainty is remarkably high.”Trump’s tariff war is reshaping the global economic order. India is trying to navigate a delicate balance, China is flooding markets with cheap goods, and developing nations are facing a fresh wave of job losses. With April 2 looming, the world is watching to see whether Trump’s hardball tactics will succeed—or whether they will trigger an even bigger economic crisis.(With inputs from agencies)","Trump’s trade war is fueling a second wave of the “China Shock,” a term used by economists to describe the massive economic disruption caused by China's rise as a manufacturing powerhouse in the early 2000s.

Ben & Jerry’s accuses Unilever of unlawful removal of CEO David Stever amid ongoing tensions,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/ben-jerrys-accuses-unilever-of-unlawful-removal-of-ceo-david-stever-amid-ongoing-tensions/articleshow/119243089.cms,"Ben & Jerry’s accused its parent company, Unilever, of unlawfully removing its CEO, alleging that the move was aimed to retaliate against the ice cream maker’s social and political activism.In a legal filing submitted late on Tuesday, the Vermont-based company said that Unilever had informed its board on 3rd March that it was replacing CEO David Stever. Ben & Jerry’s argued this decision violated the terms of its merger agreement, which requires consultation with an advisory committee from its board before any CEO can be removed.Unilever, headquartered in London, responded on Wednesday, expressing disappointment over the public nature of the dispute.“Regrettably, despite repeated attempts to engage the board and follow the correct process, we are disappointed that the confidentiality of an employee career conversation has been made public,” the company said in a statement.Unilever acquired Ben & Jerry’s in 2000 for $326 million, with the ice cream brand hoping the partnership would strengthen its social mission. However, tensions between the two companies have escalated in recent years.In 2021, Ben & Jerry’s announced it would no longer sell its products in Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem. The following year, Unilever sold its Israeli operations to a local company, which continued selling Ben & Jerry’s under its Hebrew and Arabic branding across Israel and the West Bank.Unilever has since revealed plans to spin off its entire ice cream division, including Ben & Jerry’s, by the end of 2025 as part of a wider restructuring. The consumer goods giant also owns brands such as Dove soap and Hellmann’s mayonnaise.The strained relationship took another hit last November when Ben & Jerry’s sued Unilever in a New York federal court, accusing it of attempting to silence the company’s statements supporting Palestinians in the Gaza war.The complaint also alleged that Unilever blocked Ben & Jerry’s from posting about issues it expected to be challenged in a potential second term for Donald Trump, including minimum wage policies, universal healthcare, abortion rights, and climate change.Tuesday’s filing marked an amendment to that ongoing lawsuit, further expanding the gap between the ice cream brand and its parent company.","Unilever acquired Ben & Jerry’s in 2000 for $326 million, with the ice cream brand hoping the partnership would strengthen its social mission.

MUMBAI: India remains the most cost-effective destination for remittances, yet recipients still lose around 5% of the money sent by relatives abroad in transfer costs.According to a Reserve Bank of India (RBI) study, the global average cost of sending $200 has fallen (from nearly 9.7% in 2009 to around 6.7% in Q2 2024) but remains above the G20's 5% target and the UN's 3% Sustainable Development Goal (SDG). These costs include fees and exchange-rate markups.India has, however, met the G20 target. Remittance costs were 4.9% in 2023, and just over 5% in the first half of 2024 - below the global average. India is the top recipient, followed by Mexico, China, the Philippines, France, Pakistan, and Bangladesh.Digital remittances, which were 30% of transactions in Q2 2024, are cheaper. India's digital transfers averaged 4%, a percentage point below the national average, ""reflecting the rising role of digitalisation in optimising remittance costs"".Smaller transfers are pricier. Remittances under $200 averaged 4.6%, while $200-$500 transfers were 2.4%. Fintech firms and money-transfer operators (MTOs) offer the lowest costs, increasing competition.Advanced economies (AEs) now account for over half of India's $118 billion in FY24 remittances, while Gulf states make up 38%.","India remains the most cost-effective destination for remittances.

Microsoft Corp, the biggest backer of Sam Altman's OpenAI , and BlackRock Inc, which has an executive on the artificial intelligence startup's board, are joining forces with one of his chief rivals.Microsoft and BlackRock said on Wednesday that Elon Musk's xAI is joining their effort to build $30 billion worth of data centers and other artificial intelligence infrastructure. The AI chipmaker Nvidia Corp, which was already named as a technical adviser to the group when it was announced last year, is also formally joining, according to a statement that didn't detail member commitments.Microsoft, which has invested about $13 billion in OpenAI, has increasingly been developing AI outside of that partnership. The software giant has created in-house AI models that it believes can compete with OpenAI, Bloomberg reported this month. Musk, also a co-founder of OpenAI, has meanwhile publicly feuded with Altman over the company's efforts to shift to a for-profit structure.The capital demands and enthusiasm for AI have prompted a range of companies and investors to forge alliances to build some of the biggest data centre campuses in the world. US President Donald Trump has touted hundreds of billions of dollars worth of commitments from firms including Softbank Group and OpenAI, which are behind a $100 billion AI investment plan dubbed Stargate.The Microsoft-backed group will be renamed the AI Infrastructure Partnership , or AIP, and focus on infrastructure investments - including energy projects - mostly in the US, with a portion of the funds to be deployed in partner countries, according to the companies. The plan foresees bringing on additional investors. Clients, including pensions and insurers, are eager for such long-term infrastructure projects, BlackRock chief executive officer Larry Fink said in the statement.BlackRock and Microsoft last year unveiled the coalition in partnership with MGX, a UAE investment vehicle that is also involved in Stargate, and Bayo Ogunlesi's Global Infrastructure Partners. The companies said at the time they would seek $30 billion of private equity capital over an unspecified time frame and eventually leverage as much as $100 billion in potential investments.","Microsoft and BlackRock said on Wednesday that Elon Musk's xAI is joining their effort to build $30 billion worth of data centers and other artificial intelligence infrastructure.

Impact of tariffs and economic policies

Adjusting bond holdings to stabilise markets

Inflation and consumer sentiment

Slower growth ahead



Stay informed with the latest business news, updates on bank holidays and public holidays.





The federal reserve maintained its benchmark interest rate on Wednesday, keeping it unchanged for the second consecutive meeting, while signalling that it still expects to cut rates twice before the end of the year. However, officials acknowledged growing uncertainty in the economic outlook as inflation shows signs of persistence and growth projections weaken.In its latest quarterly economic forecast, the Fed revised its expectations for economic growth, predicting a slower expansion this year and next compared to previous estimates. The central bank also anticipates a slight increase in the unemployment rate, projecting it to rise to 4.4% by the end of 2025. Inflation, which remains above the Fed's 2% target, is expected to climb to 2.7% this year from its current level of 2.5%.""Uncertainty around the economic outlook has increased,"" Fed noted in its post-meeting statement, highlighting the delicate balance policymakers must strike. While rising inflation would typically prompt the Fed to keep rates elevated or even raise them, slowing growth and rising unemployment could necessitate rate cuts to support the economy.The decision to hold rates steady comes as the central bank assesses the broader impact of the Trump administration's economic policies, particularly tariffs. Economists predict that new trade barriers could temporarily push inflation higher, while other measures, such as deregulation, may offset some of those effects by reducing costs.Fed chair Jerome Powell acknowledged that tariffs have begun to influence inflation, particularly through higher costs on imported goods.""I do think with the arrival of tariff inflation, further progress [on lowering inflation] is probably delayed,"" Powell said during a news conference.Alongside the rate decision, Fed announced a slowdown in the pace at which it is reducing its holdings of US treasury securities.Previously, the central bank allowed $25 billion in treasuries to mature each month without reinvesting the proceeds. Now, it will reinvest more aggressively, limiting the monthly runoff to just $5 billion.This move aims to keep long-term borrowing costs lower by stabilizing Treasury yields, which dipped slightly following the announcement.Despite Fed's efforts to manage inflation, concerns are growing among economists and consumers alike. Analysts at Goldman Sachs predict that inflation could climb to 3% by the end of the year, up from 2.6% currently, largely driven by import taxes.Consumer sentiment also reflects growing caution, with recent surveys indicating that Americans expect inflation to worsen. If these expectations persist, they could lead to self-fulfilling price increases as people rush to make purchases before costs rise further. Retailers and homebuilders have already signalled potential price hikes on goods and services due to the added pressure of tariffs.While inflation remains a key concern, signs of economic slowdown are also emerging. The economy has shown weaker growth in early 2025, with Barclays cutting its GDP forecast to just 0.7%, down from an earlier projection of 2.5% in 2024.With inflation still above target, growth slowing, and tariffs complicating the economic landscape, the Fed's path forward remains uncertain. Policymakers have signalled rate cuts on the horizon, but the timing and extent of those reductions will depend on how economic conditions evolve in the coming months.","The federal reserve maintained its benchmark interest rate on Wednesday, keeping it unchanged for the second consecutive meeting.

The US Federal Reserve kept the benchmark rate unchanged in the 4.25-4.5% range in its meeting today. ""In support of its goals, the Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 4-1/4 to 4-1/2 percent. In considering the extent and timing of additional adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks,"" the statement read.""Recent indicators suggest that economic activity has continued to expand at a solid pace. The unemployment rate has stabilized at a low level in recent months, and labor market conditions remain solid. Inflation remains somewhat elevated. The Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run. Uncertainty around the economic outlook has increased. The Committee is attentive to the risks to both sides of its dual mandate,"" the FOMC statement read.Federal Reserve officials maintained their projection of two interest rate reductions in 2025, whilst revising their growth estimates downwards for 2025 and increasing their inflation predictions.The US central bank officials suggested they continue to expect a reduction in borrowing costs by 50 basis points before year-end, considering the anticipated economic slowdown and eventual decline in inflation rates.The Fed's outlook for inflation saw an upward revision, with their preferred price increase measure projected to reach 2.7% by year-end, compared to the previously forecasted 2.5% in December. The Federal Reserve maintains an inflation target of 2%.Additionally, they reduced the US GDP growth forecast for the current year from 2.1% to 1.7%, alongside predictions of a marginally higher unemployment rate by the end of this year.""In assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee’s goals. The Committee’s assessments will take into account a wide range of information, including readings on labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments,"" the statement added.Most market analysts expected the Federal Reserve to maintain its current interest rate whilst monitoring economic developments. The job market appears stable, following robust economic performance at the end of last year.There is considerable ambiguity regarding the economic impact of US President Donald Trump's policies. His stated objectives include revitalising domestic manufacturing and reducing federal workforce numbers.The constant stream of policy declarations from Trump regarding tariffs and other measures has generated significant economic uncertainty. Economists are concerned this might lead American businesses and consumers to reduce their expenditure.Should economic conditions deteriorate, the Federal Reserve maintains the option to stimulate growth through interest rate reductions, as demonstrated in previous economic downturns. With the primary interest rate currently ranging between 4.25% and 4.50%, there remains substantial scope for adjustment.Also Read | Is a US recession coming? 7 charts that show the plight of the American economy However, as pointed out in an Associated Press report, the US Federal Reserve faces a more complex scenario in its current decision-making process. Whilst reducing interest rates would stimulate the economy, it could simultaneously drive inflation higher, particularly concerning given the existing tariff-related inflationary pressures.The Fed lacks effective mechanisms to address ""stagflation,"" a situation characterised by economic stagnation coupled with persistent high inflation, the report notes.Interest rate reductions, previously viewed as positive responses to inflation approaching the Fed's 2% target, might now be perceived negatively. These cuts could become necessary to counteract economic challenges stemming from widespread tariffs, substantial reductions in government expenditure, and heightened economic uncertainty.Also Read | Trump tariffs impact: Is a US recession likely and does India need to worry about it?

XRP saw a surge after Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse revealed that the US Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) is no longer pursuing its appeal in the ongoing legal case against the payments company. As a result, XRP's price jumped nearly 11%, reaching $2.52.Speaking at the Digital Assets Summit in New York on Wednesday morning, Garlinghouse reflected on the nearly four-year-long legal battle, according to CNBC.""It’s been almost four years and about three months since the SEC originally sued us, certainly a painful journey in lots of ways,"" he said. ""I really deeply believed that we were going to be on the right side of the law and on the right side of history.""Garlinghouse criticized the SEC, stating, ""The system just feels broken. That we had to fight this fight for the industry and you had an SEC attacking the industry, particularly the Ripple case. There were no victims, there was no investor loss. They were just not acting in good faith.""In 2020, the SEC filed a lawsuit against Ripple, accusing the company of violating US securities laws by selling XRP without registering it. Ripple achieved a partial victory in 2023 when US District Judge Analisa Torres ruled in favor of the company, a decision celebrated as a landmark for the crypto industry .While XRP was not deemed a security when sold to retail investors on exchanges, it was considered an unregistered security offering when sold to institutional investors.This development comes as the SEC moves swiftly to address its previous administration's actions, which had a significant impact on the crypto industry.Last month, the SEC ended its enforcement case against Coinbase, closed investigations into Robinhood's crypto unit, Uniswap, Gemini, and ConsenSys without taking enforcement action, scaled back its crypto enforcement unit, and clarified that meme coins are not considered securities. Additionally, the SEC's newly formed crypto task force is launching a roundtable series to discuss and define the security status of digital assets.XRP, created by Ripple's founders in 2012, is the native token of the XRP Ledger , which Ripple uses for cross-border payments. Approximately 95% of Ripple's business takes place outside the US, and the company is the largest holder of XRP. The token has seen a tremendous rise, up more than 390% since the postelection Trump trade, and has gained 20% in value this year.","Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse revealed that the SEC is no longer pursuing its appeal in the ongoing legal case against the payments company.

Indian airline IndiGo announced plans on Wednesday to increase its international flight capacity by fiscal year 2030 in an effort to capture a larger market share.The no-frills carrier intends to raise its international capacity share—measured as the proportion of total available seat kilometres dedicated to international routes—from the current 28% to 40%, news agency Reuters reported. This shift marks a significant growth from just 14% in fiscal year 2018, achieved in a span of seven years.IndiGo currently flies to 40 international destinations and holds a 19% share of India’s international flight market, according to the latest data from the country’s aviation regulator. Following the announcement, shares of the airline rose by 4.2%.This international expansion comes as IndiGo seeks to diversify beyond its dominant domestic market, where it holds nearly 60% of the share. The move aligns with the broader trend of Indian carriers working to meet the growing demand for both domestic and international air travel, despite challenges related to aircraft supply.Earlier this year, IndiGo revealed plans to strengthen its international presence, which currently generates around 10% of its revenue. The airline also announced plans to lease a Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner from Norse Atlantic Airways to expand its long-haul operations.IndiGo is looking to add business class seats to its Airbus A321XLR and A350 aircraft to further increase revenue, as business class tickets are priced roughly three times higher than economy class.The airline began offering business class seats on select domestic routes late last year, marking its first move away from an all-economy cabin model, and is positioning itself to capitalize on the growing demand for premium travel among Indian passengers.IndiGo also reaffirmed its goal of expanding its fleet to over 600 aircraft by 2030, up from approximately 437 currently.","Indian airline IndiGo plans to increase its international flight capacity by fiscal year 2030.

Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

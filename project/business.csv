Flipkart IPO : Flipkart, currently valued at $36 billion and recognised as India's premier ecommerce company, has set its sights on going public. The organisation is establishing a clear schedule of 12-15 months for its initial public offering (IPO), according to several individuals familiar with the plans. This forthcoming share issue, anticipated to be the largest by a new-economy company, represents a significant milestone for India's startup ecosystem, now ranked third globally.The company, under Walmart's ownership, has received internal clearance to shift its registration from Singapore to India, which is considered essential for the IPO process. Sources informed ET that the company aims to launch its public offering either by the end of next year or within 2026's first quarter.Flipkart IPO is likely to be the first among a group of approximately twelve new-age companies planning to enter the stock market in 2025. This follows the successful market entries of various consumer internet businesses, including Zomato, Nykaa and Swiggy, which have generated substantial interest among retail investors in Indian startups.The ecommerce leader has successfully secured nearly $1 billion in funding this year, with Google contributing $350 million. Although IPO discussions began in late 2021, they were temporarily suspended due to unfavourable market conditions during 2022-23.At Flipkart, under the leadership of group CEO Kalyan Krishnamurthy, the priority remains enhancing profitability whilst maintaining growth rates marginally above the industry standard.Walmart's October quarter earnings report highlighted Flipkart's impressive performance, noting double-digit growth during its signature Big Billion Days sale , which positively impacted Walmart's global revenue.Industry analysts have calculated that Indian ecommerce achieved Rs 1 lakh crore in gross sales during the festive period this year, with Flipkart retaining its market leadership position during this crucial season.Established in 2007 as an online bookstore, Flipkart's parent company is based in Singapore. This was a common practice among prominent startups of that era, who established holding companies overseas due to favourable funding conditions and regulatory frameworks.PhonePe, previously Singapore-based, relocated its domicile to India, resulting in $1 billion in tax benefits for the Indian government. Any potential merger between entities in India and Singapore would trigger tax implications. PhonePe completed its separation from Flipkart in late 2022, subsequently securing external funding from investors, including its primary stakeholder, Walmart.","Flipkart IPO is likely to be the first among a group of approximately twelve new-age companies planning to enter the stock market in 2025.

New RBI governor: Who is Sanjay Malhotra? Meet the revenue secretary who will succeed Shaktikanta Das as 26th RBI governor,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/new-rbi-governor-who-is-sanjay-malhotra-meet-the-revenue-secretary-who-will-succeed-shaktikanta-das-as-26th-rbi-governor/articleshow/116141235.cms,"Sanjay Malhotra is an Indian Administrative Service Officer of 1990 Batch Rajasthan Cadre.

Who is Sanjay Malhotra, the new RBI governor?

Will new RBI governor alter the monetary policy course?

Sanjay Malhotra, the revenue secretary, has been appointed as new Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor by the Narendra Modi government . Malhotra will succeed Shakikanta Das whose tenure is scheduled to end on December 10, 2024. Sanjay Malhotra will be the 26th governor of India's central bank.Malhotra will start his three-year tenure as RBI governor from December 11. He will take over from Shaktikanta Das , who has led the central bank since 2018. In the past Malhotra has served as a representative of the financial services department on the RBI board.Sanjay Malhotra, a 1990 batch Indian Administrative Service Officer from the Rajasthan Cadre, holds a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from IIT Kanpur and earned his Master's in Public Policy from Princeton University, USA.Throughout his career spanning more than 33 years, Sanjay Malhotra has served across diverse sectors, including power, finance, taxation, information technology, and mines. Currently serving as secretary (revenue) in the ministry of finance, he previously held the position of secretary in the department of financial services under the ministry of finance, Government of India.His extensive expertise encompasses finance and taxation at both state and central government levels. As a revenue secretary, he significantly contributes to formulating tax policies concerning both direct and indirect taxation systems, according to the department of revenue website.According to a Bloomberg report, Malhotra’s strong working relationship with the finance minister is expected to enhance the synchronisation of monetary and fiscal policies. During his ministry tenure, the successful rollout of the new income tax system stands as a notable accomplishment.Although Malhotra has maintained silence on monetary policy matters, he has advocated for investment growth through tax system simplification. In a recent address, he advised revenue officials to focus on economic development and be prudent when issuing substantial tax notices to businesses, particularly given the ongoing tax disagreements with major firms like Infosys Ltd.Also Read | Why did Shaktikanta Das-led MPC not cut repo rate despite GDP shocker? Top 5 points to know Malhotra will take charge during a challenging period for the central bank. The RBI faces mounting pressure to reduce interest rates, particularly as GDP growth declined to 5.4% in the July-September quarter, marking a seven-quarter low.Senior government officials from the Narendra Modi government have increasingly advocated for RBI easing. Both finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman and trade minister Piyush Goyal have recently expressed concerns about the economic impact of high borrowing costs.In his final policy decision on Friday, Shaktikanta Das maintained the benchmark rate whilst implementing measures to enhance banking system liquidity, potentially supporting the decelerating economy.Das indicated that food price fluctuations, comprising approximately half of the inflation basket, would likely keep price increases elevated during October to December.CPI inflation continues to exceed the RBI's target, reaching a 14-month peak of 6.21% in October. The central bank operates under a government-mandated inflation target of 4%, with a tolerance band of plus or minus two percentage points.Analysts suggest this surprise appointment will not significantly change India's monetary policy direction.According to a Bloomberg survey, most economists anticipate the central bank will begin reducing rates in early next year.""If growth continues to underwhelm, then obviously chances of interest rate cut increases, but a February rate cut still depends on data,"" said Gaurav Kapur, an economist with IndusInd Bank Ltd.""The RBI has a history of bureaucrats becoming the governor,"" said Anubhuti Sahay, an economist with Standard Chartered Bank Plc. ""Irrespective of the governor in place, we believe India is on the round of turning point where rate cuts will have to begin.""","Sanjay Malhotra will start his three-year tenure as RBI governor from December 11.

Macro matters

MUMBAI: RBI's incoming governor Sanjay Malhotra faces the challenge of balancing economic growth, inflation, and exchange rate stability - a battle that outgoing governor Shaktikanta Das was still fighting. At the same time, he has to deal with regulatory reforms affecting bank lending, curbing digital fraud, and addressing retail financial product mis-selling .The rupee has come under severe pressure following the US elections, with the dollar gaining strength and FPIs selling stocks. At the same time, senior ministers in govt have called for softer interest rates to support investments.For a central banker, the concept of the impossible trinity refers to the idea that they cannot pursue independent monetary policy, manage the exchange rate, and allow free flow of capital.Forex dealers said that the rupee had weakened in the non-deliverable forward market on Monday, which may result in a weak opening on Tuesday. While RBI is under pressure to cut rates in Feb given the slowdown in the economy in the second quarter, any pressure on the exchange rate would make this difficult.In a note released earlier this month, Rahul Bajoria, an economist with the Bank of America, highlighted RBI's ""three-body problem"" as it navigates slowing growth, elevated inflation, and exchange rate pressures.On the regulation side, Malhotra faces the challenge of implementing key regulatory changes. This includes requiring banks to make provisions for bad loans based on expected credit losses, which would hit their bottom line as well as their ability to lend in the short term but put them in a better position to deal with defaults in the future.RBI had also proposed to bring down bank exposure to project loans by requiring lenders to make hefty provisions for projects that do not get completed on time - thus completely discouraging banks from project loans. However, govt still sees a role for banks in funding investments by corporates.On the retail side, while the banking system has taken major steps on the digital front, a side effect has been a growing number of online frauds. While banking systems are secure, people are losing money to confidence tricksters who fool consumers into believing that they are remitting money to genuine billers or govt. The cyber cells of police authorities are overrun with complaints about digital fraud, and RBI is under pressure to curb these.Another issue on the retail side has been the misselling of insurance and other financial products by banks.","RBI's incoming governor Sanjay Malhotra faces the challenge of balancing economic growth, inflation, and exchange rate stability.

Several Jewelry Stocks Soared in India This Year

India’s Motilal Oswal Asset Management Co. is expecting the country’s insatiable appetite for discretionary goods and the government’s push to expand manufacturing to spur the next leg of a rally in related shares.Chief Investment Officer Niket Shah said he’s adding shares of companies that offer lower priced non-essential goods, such as jewelry and apparel, on expectations of increased spending. He’s also scouting for opportunities in India’s growing electronic component sector. The asset manager’s Motilal Oswal Midcap Fund has returned about 63% in the last 12 months against a 33% gain in its benchmark, making it the top mutual fund in the nation.As food inflation remains high, the government will try to put more money in the hands of the people, said Shah, who oversees more than $7 billion. “I’m expecting meaningful changes to the income tax code that will benefit consumers at large,” he said.While rising prices have hurt demand for fast-moving consumer goods companies, people aren’t willing to dial down on some discretionary spending, said Shah. People earning lower incomes are “aspiring to get high-end phones,” even if that means sacrificing on basic expenses, he said.Spotting sector inflection points and making timely exits have helped the fund’s performance, Shah said. He bought telecom companies Bharti Airtel Ltd., Indus Towers Ltd. and Vodafone Idea Ltd. before the industry implemented fare hikes. Bets on technology stocks Persistent Systems Ltd. and Zomato Ltd. also added to gains.In electronics manufacturing, production-linked incentives will likely boost the sector as the nation seeks to expand its role in global supply chains, according to Shah.“I’m also getting the sense that the government is slowly moving in favor of allowing some Chinese firms to set up joint ventures in India,” he said. “With technology from China and manufacturing done in India, there is a lot more scale that is achievable.”As of Nov. 31, Motilal held Kalyan Jewellers India Ltd. and affordable fashion retailer Trent Ltd. in various portfolios. It also owned shares of Dixon Technologies India Ltd., a contract manufacturer for Samsung Electronics Co.","Motilal Oswal Asset Management Co. is expecting the country’s insatiable appetite for discretionary goods to spur the next leg of a rally in related shares.

Govt support for telcos important: Jyotiraditya Scindia,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/govt-support-for-telcos-important-jyotiraditya-scindia/articleshow/116228895.cms,"Jyotiraditya Scindia (PTI file photo)

Govt has given several bailouts to the telecom industry and many feel Vodafone Idea and BSNL have been a drain on exchequer. How long will the support continue?

Apart from the terrestrial networks, what's the role that you see for OTT communication services (such as WhatsApp/Telegram/Facetime calling) and also satcom players, such as Starlink?

Telecom companies have sought 'same service, same rules', saying OTT communication services should be governed by same regulations, especially on interception and law enforcement matters. Why the discrepancy?

What is your view on entry of new satcom players such as Starlink?

Telecom minister Jyotiraditya Scindia has said that support to the mobile industry will continue as govt wants at least four-five players to back up the country's digital infrastructure. Also, amid a debate around satellite communications and entry of new players such as Elon Musk's Starlink, the minister said satcom services will help complete mobile coverage across the country. ""We want a telecom sector where we don't have a limited number of players... (and) therefore support to this industry is extremely important,"" he told TOI in an interview. Excerpts:If you look at any of the steps that we have taken to support or provide relief, it has been given for every player across the spectrum. Obviously, it has supported BSNL the most, but it has also supported other players, including the recent decision of bank guarantee waiver. We want a vibrant telecom sector. We want a telecom sector where we don't have a limited number of players... it's very important to have at least four-five players in this industry. Therefore, support to this industry is extremely important. Don't forget that in next decade, this industry is going to become the linchpin of India's rise on world stage.All these will be complementary to existing networks. There is no single media that is going to satisfy every single customer across the world. You're seeing symbiotic/synergistic technologies being used across the world to ensure 100% saturation. Satellite, in many ways, is going to be very, very complementary to 'bouquet of technologies' that is going to provide 100% accessibility across the length and breadth of our country. So, 5G today is in 99% of our districts with 82% of our population. We need to connect the balance 1% districts and 18% of our population.This is something that Trai is looking at. It's not my job to say anything when something is under the regulatory lens. When it comes to satcom, we've seen intense lobbying from incumbent telecos, which are demanding auctions, in line with how they buy spectrum? All these when the new telecom law mandates administrative allocation. Where is the disconnect? Please understand that technologically there's a big difference between spectrum for terrestrial networks and spectrum allocated to satellite-based, non-terrestrial networks. For, terrestrial networks, you can allocate frequencies exclusively which can't be used by others. But when you get into higher satellite frequencies, that spectrum cannot be allocated to a single entity. It is shared. So, how do you auction something that's shared? You can't. If you look across the world, there is not a single country today where satellite spectrum is auctioned. It's all allocated administratively. This has been debated ad nauseam in India and the first schedule in Telecom Act 2023 clearly mentions that satcom spectrum will be allocated administratively. Price of that spectrum is going to be decided by Trai, after which it will be allocated administratively.India is open to everyone. Everyone, who comes here and applies for a licence and fulfils all norms, will be granted one. There is a pro forma for a licence. If any company wants to apply, we are more than happy and welcome them. Let them fulfil all the norms, and they will get a license. The Regulatory process is clear.",Jyotiraditya Scindia says support to the mobile industry will continue. Says govt wants at least four-five players to back up the country's digital infrastructure.

NEW DELHI: The Asian Development Bank ( ADB ) on Wednesday lowered India's growth forecast for 2024-25 to 6.5% from the earlier 7%, citing lower-than-expected second quarter growth, driven by dampened manufacturing performance and lagging govt spending.The Manila-based multilateral agency also lowered growth projections for 2025-26 to 7% from earlier 7.2%. It said forecast for FY2025 has been reduced slightly due to lower-than-expected growth in private investment and housing demand, due to tight monetary policy aimed at combating inflation. Downside risks remain from geopolitical threats to supply chains and adverse weather conditions, ADB said in its Asian Development Outlook (ADO).Latest data showed GDP growth slumped to a seven-quarter low of 5.4% in the July-Sept period, dragged down by a slowing manufacturing sector and slowdown in urban consumption. It was below the 7% forecast by RBI for second quarter. The sharp slowdown has prompted a rash of downgrades of overall GDP growth for the full year.The ADB said industrial demand is affected by tighter prudential norms of the central bank for unsecured personal loans and continuation of elevated food prices. Govt's capital expenditure for FY2024 also continues to lag behind budget target, a risk highlighted in previous Sept 2024 ADO.It also said India's growth will remain robust, with the economy supported by higher agriculture output resulting from the summer crop season (which will also put downward pressure on food prices), continued resilience of services sector, and lower-than-expected Brent crude prices in 2024 and 2025. Strong forward looking and labour market indicators (such as PMI for industry and services, urban labour force participation and RBI's industrial outlook) suggest that economic momentum will recover in the coming quarters.",The Asian Development Bank ( ADB ) on Wednesday lowered India's growth forecast for 2024-25 to 6.5% from the earlier 7%.

NEW DELHI: Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Wednesday advised industry to realign its supply chain factoring in political and strategic considerations to ensure that there was no concentration of risks, a statement that appeared to be aimed at China.""When you talk of supply chains, when you want to restore supply chains to frictionless supply chains, let's not forget, it's not just economics, it's more than that. When we want to de-risk ourselves, when we want to remove certain concentrations, plus one, plus two, what are these theories? They didn't emerge out of inefficiency of economics. They emerged out of economic principles being influenced by political principles. Therefore, we have to build into our own decision making not just economic sense, but also political and strategic sense.""Supply chains will have to be restored, but you would reset it, you would realign it, you will make sure that they are spread so much that no political or geo-political or strategic risks will threaten our well-being,"" FM said at a CII event.The statement came amid repeated demands from industry to lift restrictions on Chinese investment and visas that came following the outbreak of Covid and the subsequent tension in Ladakh. In fact, the Economic Survey too had made a case for lifting investment curbs. While the border stand-off has eased, business ties have not normalised, and industry players are clamouring for a softer stance despite government's clear emphasis on building a resilient supply chain with other countries and locating production facilities in India through schemes such as production linked incentives.Sitharaman also used the platform to underline the need to check unnecessary expenditure and borrowings.

10-minute food delivery war to heat up with Zepto's standalone café app,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/10-minute-food-delivery-war-to-heat-up-with-zeptos-standalone-caf-app/articleshow/116224158.cms,"Zepto

MUMBAI: Instant delivery is the new way of life. After grocery and a host of other non-grocery household supplies, 10-minute delivery is fast becoming a fad in the food space. Taking competition directly to the doors of Zomato and Swiggy, Zepto is launching a separate app for quicker deliveries of food, branded as Zepto Café, allowing consumers to get chai, samosa and pizza delivered to their doorstep in 10 minutes. Indians are familiar with 30-minute delivery of certain food items like pizzas but with quick commerce changing the way people consume and transact, consumers are taking to rapid delivery of food and players like Zepto and Swiggy are trying to capitalise on the trend. “For consumers looking to get food in 10 minutes, it doesn’t matter if the food is coming from Zepto Café or Zomato. For them, Zepto Café is also now an option for ordering their sandwich and samosa. Zepto is playing on the strength of 10-minute delivery. Competition in the food delivery space will increase—ultimately, the money that will be spent on Zepto café will come from the wallet of a Zomato or Swiggy customer,” Satish Meena, advisor at Datum Intelligence told TOI. Zepto competes with Zomato’s Blinkit and Swiggy Instamart in the broader quick commerce market.Until now, consumers could only order café products through the main Zepto app; that option will continue to be available. To be sure, Zepto does not follow a food aggregator model or partner with restaurant brands unlike Zomato and Swiggy. It sources ingredients and ready to eat food items from local vendors and uses a network of kitchens stationed within its dark stores to cook and heat up the products before deliveries. Currently, it offers only a select menu but plans are afoot to broaden it going ahead. “We have speed ovens and coffee machines within our kitchens. It takes us less than two minutes to cook everything in the menu,” a company spokesperson said. In October, Swiggy had launched its 10-minute food delivery offering Bolt; Zomato currently delivers everyday (home made) meals in 15 minutes although industry experts said that the company may also look to push a 10-minute offering into the market soon. Analysts do not completely rule out the possibility of Zepto considering partnering with restaurant brands and offering full-fledged food delivery service like Zomato and Swiggy sometime going ahead. “If the Zepto Café app works, they always have the option of expanding into broader food delivery. Once Zepto Cafe gets customer traffic, restaurants will also be keen on joining them,” said Meena.Zepto Café operates across 15% of the quick commerce firm’s 600 odd dark stores and is limited to six cities as of now but with the separate app going live next week, the plan is to scale up the offering to cover all dark stores and cities where Zepto operates. “There is a significant consumer top-of-mind advantage to a separate app and we are seeing the economics work standalone. So, a standalone app makes sense,” said Aadit Palicha, co-founder and CEO at Zepto which claims that its café offering sees 30,000 orders per day.","Zepto is launching a separate app for quicker deliveries of food, branded as Zepto Café.

US core inflation stays firm with fourth-straight 0.3% increase,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-core-inflation-stays-firm-with-fourth-straight-0-3-increase/articleshow/116218462.cms,"File photo: Customers eat at the counter of the Lexington Candy Shop, in New York. (AP Photo/Mary Altaffer, File)

US consumer prices continued to rise in November at a pace that is fueling concerns the progress toward taming inflation is stalling.The so-called core consumer price index — which excludes food and energy costs — increased 0.3% for a fourth straight month, Bureau of Labor Statistics figures showed Wednesday. From a year ago, it rose 3.3%.Traders continued to bet on a Federal Reserve interest-rate cut next week after the figures came in largely as expected.Follow the reaction in real time here on Bloomberg’s TOPLive blogEconomists see the core gauge as a better indicator of the underlying inflation trend than the overall CPI that includes often-volatile food and energy costs. The headline measure rose 0.3% from the prior month and 2.7% from a year before. Shelter costs accounted for nearly 40% of the overall advance.While price pressures have subsided from a peak seen during the pandemic recovery, progress has leveled off more recently. That, along with receding concerns over the labor market, helps explain why several US central bankers have argued for a more gradual pace of interest-rate cuts.The CPI report showed goods costs excluding food and energy climbed 0.3%, the most since May 2023 and fueled by higher prices for new and used vehicles as well as apparel. That category had been a large driver of disinflation over the past year and a half.Grocery prices jumped 0.5%, the biggest advance since the start of last year.Economists have paid close attention to shelter prices, the largest category within services and one of the most persistent sources of inflation in recent years. That metric advanced 0.3% in November after a 0.4% gain in the prior month. Owners’ equivalent rent as well as rent of primary residence — subsets of shelter — both edged up 0.2%, the smallest gains since 2021.Excluding housing and energy, service prices rose 0.3% for a second month, according to Bloomberg calculations. While central bankers have stressed the importance of looking at such a metric when assessing the overall inflation trajectory, they compute it based on a separate index.That measure — known as the personal consumption expenditures price index — doesn’t put as much weight on shelter as the CPI, which is one reason why it’s trending closer to the Fed’s 2% target.A government report on producer prices due Thursday will offer insights into categories that feed directly into PCE, including health-care services, airfares and portfolio management.Policymakers also pay close attention to wage growth, as it can help inform expectations for consumer spending — the main engine of the economy. A separate report Wednesday that combines the inflation figures with recent wage data showed real hourly earnings grew 1.3% from a year ago.Part of the reason why Fed officials have indicated they’re in no rush to lower borrowing costs is because they no longer believe the labor market to be a source of inflation.Looking ahead, it remains to be seen to what extent President-elect Donald Trump ’s agenda will weigh on the trajectory of inflation. While consumers’ views of the economy and their finances have improved since he sealed his return to the White House, many economists say some of his campaign promises could put additional pressure on inflation. Some businesses, for example, are considering raising prices in anticipation of higher tariffs.","Core consumer price index increased 0.3% for a fourth straight month. From a year ago, it rose 3.3%.

Is Nissan's decline inevitable? Honda merger talks could hold key to survival,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/is-nissans-decline-inevitable-honda-merger-talks-could-hold-key-to-survival/articleshow/116148355.cms,"Representative image (Picture credit: AP)

Is a Honda merger the answer?

Nissan is grappling with a severe financial crisis that could lead to bankruptcy within the next 12 to 14 months unless decisive action is taken. The company, once a leader in the automotive industry, is now in its worst position since Carlos Ghosn's dramatic efforts in 1999 to pull it from the brink of collapse.With profits plunging by 70 per cent and a recent $60 million loss, Nissan is scrambling to find a solution to its mounting troubles, reported Forbes.In an attempt to salvage its future, Nissan has outlined a major restructuring plan, targeting $3 billion in savings.This includes slashing 9,000 jobs globally and selling a significant portion of its stake in Mitsubishi Motors . The company is also cutting production by 20 per cent at key US facilities in Canton, Mississippi, and Smyrna, Tennessee, which together employ over 13,000 workers.In a rare move, CEO Makoto Uchida has taken a 50 per cent pay cut to signal the urgency of the situation.Nissan’s woes can largely be attributed to its struggle to adapt to the rapidly changing automotive landscape.The company’s electric vehicle lineup is minimal, with only two models available internationally, while cheaper Chinese EV alternatives are flooding the market. Despite these challenges, there are bright spots.In the US, the locally-built Rogue SUV remains a top performer, having sold over 189,000 units through September 2024. Similarly, the Qashqai continues to dominate in Europe.However, these successes are not enough to counteract the broader decline, as per Forbes.Nissan is now searching for a lifeline, and a potential merger with Honda could be the key to its survival. The two companies recently signed a partnership focused on electric vehicle development , and some industry experts are speculating that a merger could help combine resources to overcome current financial struggles.According to the Financial Times, while this idea remains speculative, it could provide Nissan with the strength it needs to compete in the increasingly competitive global automotive market.Reacting to the report, Nissan Motor India spokesperson said, “As a policy we do not comment on speculatory reports. Nissan remains committed to its India operations, dealers, partners, and customers. We remain on track for our plan announced earlier this year at the launches of the Nissan X-TRAIL and New Nissan Magnite.”Nissan’s future remains uncertain, and time is running out. The company must make bold decisions, such as finding a major investor or merging with Honda if it hopes to avoid the fate of bankruptcy.","Nissan has outlined a major restructuring plan, targeting $3 billion in savings.

TSMC rules

Trump tariffs

As South Korea descends into political chaos, its equity market risks falling further behind major tech rival Taiwan, which is basking in the glory of the global artificial intelligence boom.A near 30% surge in Taiwan’s stock benchmark this year, set to be the best since 2009, has already helped spur a historic divergence between Asia’s two tech-dominated markets. The island’s market capitalization now exceeds South Korea’s by about $950 billion as the world’s AI frontrunners from Nvidia Corp. and Microsoft Corp. to OpenAI all increasingly turn to Taiwanese firms for supply.Looking ahead to next year, while both export-oriented economies face the risk of higher tariffs by incoming US President Donald Trump, many investors see Taiwan as less vulnerable given the reliance of American firms on its technology as well as its relatively better economic prospects.Such optimism, and a recent pickup in inflows into local stocks, also augur well for the Taiwanese dollar, which has fared better than the Korean won in 2024.“The structural theme of AI is likely to only get extended further, and this means we could see another year of Taiwan outperformance,” said Charu Chanana, chief investment strategist at Saxo Markets in Singapore. “The Korea discount may linger for longer given the recent political debacle, and the corporate governance reforms will have to be prioritized to get any closer to erasing this discount.”South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol is fighting for his political life after his attempt to break an impasse in parliament by briefly imposing martial law backfired. The turmoil has cast a pall over the nation’s outlook and it also may impact the Corporate Value-Up program much touted by Yoon as a way to boost shareholder returns and eradicate the so-called Korea Discount, a term referring to the long depressed valuations of the country’s equities.Down more than 8% this year, the Kospi is one of the world’s worst-performing major equity indexes. Its underperformance versus Taiwan’s Taiex has deepened further this month.Taiwan’s equity-market outperformance has a lot to do with this year’s 80% surge in the shares of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., the world’s top advanced chipmaker that accounts for 37% of the benchmark’s weighting. The company is the major supplier of Nvidia and Apple Inc.’s most advanced chips.In contrast, shares of Samsung Electronics Co. — South Korea’s most-valued company — have been the biggest drag on its local market. Samsung’s stock has slumped 31% in Seoul this year on concerns that the firm is missing out on the AI boom due to slow progress on technological breakthroughs and lingering management woes.Overall, Taiwan’s exposure to AI goes far beyond TSMC: over 40 AI-related firms constitute about 73% of MSCI Taiwan’s index weighting, according to Goldman Sachs Group analysts. At 33%, Korea is a distant second in Asia and features SK Hynix Inc. and Samsung Electronics only.Analysts’ average earnings per share estimate for MSCI Taiwan has risen more than 33% this year to a record high, while that for MSCI Korea has declined 5% since a peak in August, Bloomberg compiled data shows.“If you think of Nvidia’s AI server market and so on, Taiwan is heavily involved in that value chain,” said Yan Taw Boon, portfolio manager at Neuberger Berman. “Conversely, Korea has not performed as strongly as they have very little involvement in this new booming environment.”While the higher tariffs threatened by Trump are a universal challenge, there are reasons some investors believe that Taiwan’s treatment may be more nuanced and less punishing.“One will recall that many Taiwanese exports were exempt from tariffs last time around as they were key components of US tech supply chains,” JPMorgan Chase & Co. analysts including Rajiv Batra wrote in a note. “This time is likely to be the same with TSMC seen as a major part of the Global AI trade.”The Wall Street bank sees Taiwan relatively better positioned than Korea in a trade war with the US.Another buffer for Taiwanese equities is the growing presence of local investors, especially when the global investment climate turns more capricious.“Taiwan retail investors’ home bias and the still interesting AI ramp-up theme should continue to drive participation in the stock market,” said Vivian Pai, fund manager at Fidelity International. Their increased awareness of long-term investing can help form strong consistent inflows into local stocks, she added.The Taiwan dollar has weakened about 5% against the US currency this year while the Korean won has fallen around 9%.“Both Taiwan and Korea are exposed to tariffs but Taiwan’s underlying economic fundamentals are more solid,” said Eddie Cheung, a strategist at Credit Agricole CIB. “This should persist in 2025.”",Taiwan's market capitalization now exceeds South Korea's by about $950 billion.

Rexas Finance (RXS): The future of real-world asset tokenisation?

Tokenising real-world assets: A $379.7 trillion opportunity

Why Rexas Finance could hit $2.5

There’s no doubt that cryptocurrencies remain highly volatile assets. Investors seek high-yield projects, and while Ripple leads in cross-border blockchain transactions, a new contender is emerging. Rexas Finance (RXS) has a big vision of Real World Asset (RWA) tokenisation. By integrating traditional assets with blockchain technology, Rexas Finance creates opportunities for investors to penetrate high-value markets that have been hard to navigate, such as real estate and art. This analysis reviews the possibility of RXS replicating Ripple’s steps to the $2.5 mark and whether it would attract investors during the process.Ripple's popularity stems from its fast, low-cost global payment platform. Currently priced at $2.33, XRP boasts a market capitalisation of $133.6 billion, reflecting strong investor confidence. The coin is still dominant despite its prominent issues with SEC accusations of the company. RippleNet, the company's payment network, gained the confidence of many banks and financial institutions. This reinforces expectations for the future of XRP quite a lot. The investors’ mood is quite optimistic as many think of a positive outcome of the ongoing SEC case, which is likely to create new highs for XRP. Some analysts predict that the price might rise to around $3 only in the short term, while $5 is possible but only if Ripple can penetrate many institutional on-boards and acquire new customers throughout the industry. XRP provides steady growth, but other newer projects, such as Rexas Finance (RXS), which is focused on real-world asset tokenisation and other latest trends within the blockchain industry, are perceived to present opportunities for higher exponential returns.Unlike Ripple, Rexas Finance is focused on revolutionising the investment landscape by bridging conventional assets with blockchain technology. The project enables fractional ownership of high-value assets like real estate, gold, and art, broadening access for more investors. The presale has raised $21 million, selling 292 million RXS tokens out of a total supply of 1 billion. The current Stage 9 presale price of $0.125 marks a significant increase from the initial $0.030 price, reflecting a 320% surge. The next presale stage will sell for $0.15, with substantial growth potential after that. Rexas Finance’s decision to bypass venture capital funding and adopt a community-driven presale model has been a strategic success. This inclusive approach aligns with blockchain’s decentraliz\sation principles, fostering trust and loyalty among early investors.Rexas Finance’s selling point hits the point, showing how they can gain access to huge markets through tokenisation. The real estate industry is said to have a market worth around $379.7 trillion; when it comes to gold or other commodities, the entire segment is valued at $121.2 trillion. There is also room for expansion in the $65 billion annual revenue art market. Rexas Finance unlocks investment opportunities in high-value assets by tokenizing them, making it possible for people to invest in expensive properties and commodities without the usual constraints of high capital requirements. Users of Rexas Token Builder and Launchpad, among other of the platform’s tools, can develop their own tokenised assets and invest in fractionalized shares of luxury objects. This advancement makes it easier for people to hold assets while increasing security, transparency, and reach to users worldwide.Rexas Finance's presale performance, coupled with innovation in the business model, is why it can reach the $2.5 mark after launch. Since the token price is $0.125, this is a win-win situation for early investors who hope to get better rates before the token gets primary exchange listings in early 2025. Another factor that allowed the platform to attract a more extensive investor base is its listing on the CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko platforms. In addition, the $1 million giveaway, promising 20 prizes of 50,000 RXS tokens, generated a lot of buzz and engagement. Hitting the $2.5 target is not just wishful thinking. The combination of Rexas Finance’s existing and future focus on tokenizing global real-world assets and the community-building element will ensure explosive growth. As more and more people use Rexas Finance, and if the platform's innovation trend continues, the $2.5 mark is very much attainable.The price of Ripple (XRP) remains fairly stable for investing purposes, with its offerings revolving around the payments and remittance sector. For investors who want to take on a higher risk and expect better returns, there is Rexas Finance (RXS), which appears worth looking into. The token aims to leverage the growing market of tokenized real-world assets at a community level. It has been focused heavily on its pre-sale activities, giving it much room for growth. Rexas Finance is an exciting investment. It is currently priced at $0.125, but estimates project it to reach $2.5 post-launch. For those wishing to take advantage of the potential within blockchain technology these days, Rexas Finance cannot be overlooked.For more information about Rexas Finance (RXS) visit the links below:Website: https://rexas.com Whitepaper: https://rexas.com/rexas-whitepaper.pdf Twitter/X: https://x.com/rexasfinance Telegram: https://t.me/rexasfinance","Rexas Finance (RXS) has a big vision of Real World Asset (RWA) tokenisation.

President-elect Donald Trump’s pick of a crypto proponent to be the next head of the US securities regulator lifted Bitcoin to $100,000 for the first time as traders warmed to the prospect of relaxed regulations.The digital asset rose as much as 6.1% to $103,801 on Thursday before changing hands at $101,968 as of 6:45 am in London. The crypto market overall has jumped by roughly $1.3 trillion since Trump’s election victory on Nov 5 on a platform that includes a tight embrace of the crypto sector.Trump selected Paul Atkins to replace outgoing Securities & Exchange Commission chair Gary Gensler, who cracked down on digital assets after a 2022 market rout exposed fraudulent practices and sparked costly blowups.“This is a momentum rally,” said Jason Titman, CEO, crypto brokerage Swyftx. “Global spot volumes are above mid-pandemic levels and nomination of Paul Atkins as SEC chair just added to the carnival atmosphere.”On November 22, Bitcoin was less than $300 from achie ving $100,000 but fell back while remaining in sight of the landmark level. Crypto’s adherents view the six-figure number as a validation of controversial claims that Bitcoin is a modern-day store of value and a hedge for inflation risk. For critics, the digital asset lacks any fundamental value and is too exposed to speculative whims.Hitting $100,000 is “a huge milestone for token and crypto industry as a whole,” said Caroline Mauron, co-founder of Orbit Markets, a provider of liquidity for crypto derivatives. “We expect further momentum for the coming days.”US exchange-traded funds for Bitcoin have attrac ted a net inflow of about $32 billion this year, including over $8 billion since Trump became president-elect, data compiled by Bloomberg sho wed. The combined trading volume for digital assets and related derivatives across centralised exchanges climbed to a record of more than $10 trillion last month, according to CCData.Trump has vowed to undo a Biden administration clampdown on digital assets, install friendly regulators and turn the US into global home of crypto. The Republican even backed idea of strategic national Bitcoin reserve, though there are doubts over whether the latter objective is feasible.","The digital asset rose as much as 6.1% to $103,801 on Thursday before changing hands at $101,968 as of 6:45 am in London.

NEW DELHI: More than 1.14 lakh startups in India have created over 12 lakh jobs so far, the finance ministry said in its latest review of the Indian economy .In the report titled, ‘The Indian Economy: A Review January 2024’, the Department of Economic Affairs said that the 1.14 lakh startups recognised by the government under the 'Startup India initiative’ created more than 12 lakh jobs (as of October 2023).The state-owned e-commerce platform Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC) clocked more than 63 lakh transactions till November 2023, the document read.Despite facing global challenges in 2023 like valuation issues, few IPOs, regulatory changes and macroeconomic and geopolitical trends, India remains the third largest tech start-up ecosystem globally, with over 950 tech startups founded last year.The cumulative funding for more than 31,000 tech start ups has exceeded $70 billion (from 2019 to 2023), according to a recent report by Nasscom in collaboration with Zinnov.“In 2023, despite facing global economic and regulatory challenges, Indian tech startups have prioritised the imperative of enhancing their business fundamentals, driving profitability and growth,” said Debjani Ghosh, President, Nasscom.“The proliferation of tech startups in tier 2 and 3 cities marks the ecosystem's resilience,” she added.Navigating 2024, tech startup founders expect to continue the revenue growth path with measured steps focusing on optimising expenditure and maximising profitability for B2B tech startups.Investments in deeptech will continue an upward trend in 2024.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume.While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

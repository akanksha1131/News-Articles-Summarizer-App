Government revises norms linked to dividend payment for PSUs,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/government-revises-norms-linked-to-dividend-payment-for-psus/articleshow/115432312.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Centre on Monday unveiled revised guidelines for state-run firms linked to dividend payment, buyback of shares , issue of bonus shares and splitting of shares and the measures are aimed at creating value in PSUs to maximise returns for govt and other shareholders.The Department of Investment and Public Asset Management (DIPAM) released the revised guidelines, amending its earlier 2016 rules, to better reflect market realities. The objectives of the revised guidelines include enhancing value of the CPSE and total returns for the shareholders, improving performance and efficiency of these entities by providing them more operational and financial flexibility. These are also aimed at enabling CPSEs to play an effective role in economic growth of the country and ensure more investors participate in the value creation by CPSEs.""These guidelines have been done keeping in mind the realities of the market and are forward looking. They will also help PSUs to push capex and provide them flexibility,"" said Tuhin Kanta Pandey, secretary DIPAM.Under the revised guidelines every CPSE would pay a minimum annual dividend of 30% of profit after tax (PAT) or 4% of the networth, whichever is higher subject to the limit, if any, under any extant legal provision. Earlier the limit was 5% of net worth. Financial sector CPSES like NBFCs may pay a minimum annual dividend of 30% of PAT subject to the limit.The new guidelines say that unlisted CPSES may pay a dividend once in a year as final dividend based on previous year audited financials.The guidelines says that CPSEs, whose market price of the share is less than the book value consistently for the last six months, and having net-worth of atleast Rs. 3000 crore and cash and bank balance of over Rs. 1500 crore may consider the option to buy-back their shares.Under the new guidelines, every CPSE may consider the issue of bonus shares when their defined reserves and surplus are equal to or more than 20 times of its paid-up equity share capital.With regard to splitting of shares, the revised guidelines stipulate a listed CPSE where market price exceeds 150 times of its face value consistently for the last six months may consider a split-off of its shares. There should be a cooling off period of at least three years between two successive share splits.These guidelines don't apply to PSBs, insurance companies and also to any entity which is prohibited from distribution of profits and companies set up under section 8 of the Companies Act, 2013.","The measures are aimed at creating value in PSUs to maximise returns for govt and other shareholders.

Use of AI: The government is developing voluntary guidelines and ethical standards for organisations involved in artificial intelligence (AI) and generative AI operations, according to sources who spoke to ET.The Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology is crafting these standards as informal guiding principles for organisations, particularly those developing large language models (LLMs) or utilising data for AI and machine learning model training, as confirmed by an official.""A law on AI is still some time away.

What will Donald Trump as US President mean for Indian stock markets? Top advantages & disadvantages,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/what-will-donald-trump-as-us-president-mean-for-indian-stock-markets-top-advantages-disadvantages/articleshow/115005808.cms,"India stands to potentially benefit from this situation, with improved prospects for Foreign Portfolio Investment.

Benefits of Trump's Potential Victory for India

Indian export sectors could gain significant advantages if Trump wins, as higher tariffs on Chinese products may enhance competitiveness of Indian manufacturers in areas like auto parts, solar equipment, and chemical production in US markets.

Energy costs might decrease due to Trump's fossil fuel policies and expected slower Chinese economic growth. This could positively impact Indian oil companies like HPCL, BPCL, IOC, and gas distribution firms such as IGL and MGL.

Manufacturing and defense sectors could experience growth as Trump's emphasis on US industrial development may benefit companies operating in both countries, including ABB, Siemens, Cummins, Honeywell, GE T&D, and Hitachi Energy.

Resolution of international tensions under Trump could improve supply chain efficiency, aiding Indian businesses. His focus on strengthening US manufacturing and military capabilities could provide opportunities for Indian defense companies like Bharat Dynamics and HAL.

The business climate could improve with Trump's leadership, potentially benefiting Indian equity markets through reduced corporate taxation, fewer regulatory requirements, and business-friendly policies.

Disadvantages for India due to Trump's Return:

A Trump presidency could trigger inflation, affecting Indian businesses through higher interest rates and increased costs for US-sourced materials and equipment. Economic experts anticipate that his proposed policies on tariffs, deportation, and deficit spending could cause inflationary pressures, resulting in immediate price increases and wage adjustments.

Trump's economic policies could strengthen the US dollar and increase bond yields through tax reductions and fiscal measures. This would attract global capital to the US, potentially weakening emerging market currencies including the Indian rupee. A stronger dollar would increase India's import expenses, particularly for oil, leading to higher domestic inflation.

Despite possible initial market gains, Trump's policy uncertainties could create extended market instability. Previous data shows US markets outperformed Indian markets during his first term, with Nasdaq gaining 77% compared to Nifty's 38%.

Previous restrictions on H-1B visas under Trump affected Indian IT companies through increased rejection rates and costs. However, these companies have adapted by increasing local US hiring and green card holders, reducing their vulnerability to future immigration restrictions.

Trump has criticized India's trade policies and suggested reciprocal tariffs. His administration could pressure India to reduce trade barriers, affecting sectors like IT, pharmaceuticals, and textiles. However, his efforts to reduce Chinese manufacturing dependence could benefit India.

The anticipated increase in the US fiscal deficit under Trump could lead to global inflation and higher interest rates, creating challenges for emerging markets' monetary policies. While India's domestic-focused economy provides some buffer, a Harris victory would likely maintain current economic frameworks with minimal disruption.

US election results : Republican candidate Donald Trump is projected to defeat Democrat candidate Kamala Harris in the US presidential elections, as per the latest counting trends. Indian equity markets have responded positively to Trump’s potential win. But what will the long-term impact of Trump at the White House be for Indian stock markets?A Republican sweep might trigger a short-term upswing in stock markets, primarily due to gains in US equity markets, as per Emkay Global's analysis.The Chinese markets, however, are expected to face heightened volatility and uncertainty during this period.India appears to be among the primary beneficiaries of Trump's presidency, particularly concerning economic and foreign policy matters. As Nomura's Sonal Verma states, ""We see India as a relative beneficiary, due to its domestic demand-driven growth model and benefits from lower commodity prices, supply chain shifts and on foreign policy.""The advantages India stands to gain from the current supply chain reorganisation, as companies reduce their dependence on China during Trump's administration, are likely to outweigh any potential challenges related to trade and immigration policies, according to Verma.According to an ET analysis, India stands to potentially benefit from this situation, with improved prospects for Foreign Portfolio Investment positioning and increased capital flows, according to the brokerage firm's assessment.

DA Hike Calculator: How much will the take home salary increase?

To understand the impact of this 3% DA hike, let's consider an example:

Assuming a central government employee has a basic pay of Rs 46,200, their previous dearness allowance at 50% was Rs 23,100. With the DA now at 53%, their dearness allowance will increase to Rs 24,486.

This means they will receive an additional Rs 1,386 (Rs 24,486 - Rs 23,100) in DA from October. As the DA hike is effective from July 1, 2024, they will also receive arrears for the last three months.

DR Hike Calculator: How much will the pension increase?

If a central government pensioner receives a basic pension of Rs 50,400 per month, at the previous 50% DR, they were getting Rs 25,200.

With the DR now at 53%, they will receive Rs 26,712 monthly as dearness relief. This means their pension will increase by Rs 1,512 per month.

DA hike calculator : PM Narendra Modi-led Union Cabinet has approved a 3% increase in the dearness allowance (DA) for central government employees on October 16, 2024. Additionally, the dearness relief (DR) for central government pensioners has also been raised by 3%. As a result of this latest hike, the DA and DR now stand at 53% for both central government employees and pensioners respectively. This decision is set to benefit over 1 crore individuals.The dearness allowance, a component of the salary for government employees and pensioners, has been increased to 53%. This rise in DA will lead to an increase in the take-home salary of central government employees starting from October 2024.The effective date for the increased DA and DR is July 1, 2024. The central government typically revises these allowances twice a year, in January and July, with official announcements being made at a later date.

Gold Loan EMIs: Following RBI 's identification of gaps in gold loan disbursements by banks and lending institutions, the sector is looking to start monthly amortisation schemes. The regulated bodies may require borrowers to start interest and principal payments through EMIs immediately upon loan approval. Additionally, lenders are considering term loan alternatives for gold-backed lending.On September 30, the RBI highlighted irregularities in lending against gold ornaments and jewellery. The central bank discovered issues in loan sourcing, valuation, diligence procedures, end-use monitoring, auction transparency, LTV ratio oversight, and risk weight application. The practice of rolling over gold loans with partial payments was deemed inadequate.""The regulator's diktat is clear, it wants lenders to examine the payment capacity of borrowers and not solely rely on the collateral,"" a senior banking official told ET. ""It is also unhappy with allowing rollover of such loans with part payment, which could lead to some delinquencies when repayments come up. We are now structuring monthly payment options for gold loans.""Currently, gold loan providers offer bullet repayment options, allowing borrowers to settle the entire amount at tenure end without EMI commitments.Alternatively, borrowers can make flexible partial repayments when funds are available, settling the complete principal and interest before the loan matures.This directive follows substantial growth in gold loan portfolios across banks and NBFCs recently. Crisil reports that bank-issued retail loans against gold jewellery grew 37% between April and August, coinciding with rising gold prices. Gold-loan-focused NBFCs recorded 11% growth in assets under management in Q1 FY25.""The sector faces underlying challenges as the continuous build-up of leverage raises concerns about borrowers' ability to service debt, especially given limited visibility into their cash flows or for that matter the end use of funds,"" said Prakash Agarwal, partner at consulting firm Gefion Capital.""A potential correction in gold prices could pose significant risks, as declining collateral values might create refinancing challenges and strain repayment capacity. Lenders must remain vigilant, balancing growth with prudent risk management to mitigate potential vulnerabilities.""As of September 30, banks' jewellery loan disbursements reached Rs 1.4 lakh crore, showing 51% growth compared to 14.6% in the previous year.Recent quarters have seen substantial growth in gold loans, supported by increased gold prices enabling additional top-ups on existing collateral. Limited access to unsecured and microfinance loans drove more borrowers towards gold loans.

""I certainly think that the current outcome is going to be more pro-business and pro-growth,"" he said at the 27th edition of the Bengaluru Tech Summit held here on Tuesday.""If you look at the last 25-30 years, the tech services model has survived and thrived. It has survived and thrived regardless of the political party in power or the administration that was formed. There is some amount of political rhetoric that is imposed in any election. But I think the model is quite strong and sustainable irrespective of what the government is in power. The conversation we're having on fewer taxes and less regulation, I think, will be incredibly powerful. So, I'm quite hopeful, but we've also got to be watchful about the inflationary pressure,"" Premji said.Industry observers suggest that a potential second Trump presidency would likely have contrasting immigration policies. While taking strict measures against unauthorised border crossings, he would implement robust controls on employment-based visas. Indian IT firms are the largest users of H-1B visas and non-immigrant visas that allow US firms to temporarily employ foreign workers. But in recent times, Indian IT companies have hired more locals and reduced their visa dependency significantly.Premji has emphasised that although it is essential to consider safeguards against geopolitical risks. However, he said that the IT services continue to survive and thrive despite the geopolitical uncertainty.""The world is deeply interconnected, and I think being able to undo that is not going to be easier. So how do we find ways to work in a manner where we derisk by creating more optionality? So, you can't be one country dependent or one supply chain dependent, but you create more opportunities. And you see India being a huge beneficiary of some of that, especially on the manufacturing side,"" Premji said.Premji lauded how digital public infrastructure democratised access to technology and created a level-playing field. He also spoke about leveraging data in education and healthcare for ecosystem growth. ""I think this is a huge opportunity. Like we've done with the whole digital public infrastructure space, we created the infrastructure and then unleashed the potential of that into the ecosystem. If we can do similar things with the kinds of datasets we have in areas like education and healthcare, and then allow the ecosystem to leverage that and build the relevant use cases on top, it can be tremendously powerful.""",Wipro chairman Rishad Premji is optimistic about the incoming Trump administration's pro-business stance.

MUMBAI: Economists expect rates to remain higher for longer, with the latest inflation data exceeding RBI's tolerance band ahead of the upcoming monetary policy committee (MPC) meeting. At the same time, FM Nirmala Sitharaman and commerce minister Piyush Goyal have made a case for RBI to overlook the spike in food prices and reduce interest rates.""Both govt and RBI are talking of their specific objectives and both help to maintain momentum of economy. Govt believes lower rates can spur investment and consumption. Meanwhile, RBI's MPC is mandated to set policy rates with the primary goal of controlling inflation. With inflation currently outside the tolerance band, MPC will consider this while deciding on rates,"" said Madan Sabnavis, chief economist, Bank of Baroda.Sabnavis said that while lower rates theoretically boost consumption and investment, this isn't always observed during low-rate periods. ""Consumption spending primarily depends on income levels, among other factors, with borrowings only supporting consumption marginally. Similarly, investment decisions are largely driven by capacity utilisation,"" he said.Although banks see deposit rates peaking, some, including SBI, now expect rate cuts only by February. Radhika Rao, senior economist at DBS, said, ""Episodes of strong unseasonal rains have impacted perishables' costs along with pass-through of import tax hikes on oilseeds. These will push the Q3FY25 quarterly inflation above the RBI's projection for a second consecutive quarter, to mid-5% compared to the official forecast at 4.8% YoY.""Rao added that fading supply disruptions could align inflation with targets, creating a narrow window for rate cuts in early 2025. ""We expect rate cuts to start in Feb 2025, but revise the magnitude to 75bps by end-2025,"" she said.","Economists expect rates to remain higher for longer, with the latest inflation data exceeding RBI's tolerance band.

"Food prices in focus amid inflation, interest rate call",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/food-prices-in-focus-amid-inflation-interest-rate-call/articleshow/115468422.cms,"Why are food prices in focus?

What is the

Monetary Policy

Framework?

How Economic Survey's views on re-examining the inflation targeting framework sparked the debate?

Why food inflation pressures cannot be ignored?

The sharp spike in retail inflation rate in October to a 14-month high of 6.2% has triggered a fresh debate about the country's inflation targeting framework and whether food prices should be excluded while setting interest rates. Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman has called for more discussion on using interest rates to control food prices and asserted that govt was taking steps to control food supply side issues. Her comments came shortly after commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal said targeting food prices through interest rates was an ""absolutely flawed theory."" Chief economic adviser V Anantha Nageswaran said that removing tomato, onion, potato, gold and silver from the calculation reveals a headline CPI rate of just 4.2% in October.TOI looks at the issues linked to the debate:Prices of tomato, onion and potato (TOP) have pushed the retail inflation higher and above the central bank's upper tolerance level of 6%. Supply side issues have been blamed for the price increase and there are expectations that the situation will reverse once supplies normalise. Food prices have led to seasonal spikes, complicating the overall retail inflation situation. Economists say food inflation cannot be ignored as it has a high weight in the consumer price index (CPI) basket and persistent high food inflation raises inflationary expectations. Food inflation has remained high in the country over the past two years, complicating the policy choice.The RBI Act was amended in May 2016 for providing a statutory basis for rolling out the inflation targeting framework for five years. The Centre and RBI finalise the inflation target based on the consumer price index. It has set a 4% inflation target with the upper tolerance limit at 6% and the lower level at 2%. In March 2021, it has retained the target and the tolerance for the next five years up to March 31, 2026.The latest Economic Survey had suggested excluding food prices from the inflation targeting framework. It had argued that higher food prices are, more often, not demand-induced but supply-induced and short-run monetary policy tools are meant to counteract price pressures arising out of excess aggregate demand growth. ""Deploying them to deal with inflation caused by supply constraints may be counterproductive. Therefore, it is worth exploring whether India's inflation targeting framework should target the inflation rate excluding food,"" said the document authored by Nageswaran.It said that hardship caused by higher food prices for poor and low-income consumers can be handled through direct benefit transfers or coupons for specified purchases valid for appropriate durations.RBI governor Shaktikanta Das in his monetary policy statement had said that the monetary policy committee's target is the headline inflation where food & beverage inflation has a weight of around 46%. He had asserted that with this high share of food in the consumption basket, food inflation pressures cannot be ignored. Das had said that the public at large understands inflation more in terms of food inflation than the other components of headline inflation. ""Therefore, we cannot and should not become complacent merely because core inflation (stripping out food and fuel) has fallen considerably,"" the governor had said.The governor had said that high food inflation adversely affects household inflation expectations, which have a significant impact on future trajectory of inflation. RBI is of the view that stubborn high food inflation and unanchored inflation expectations - if they materialise - could lead to spillovers to core inflation through pick-up in wages on cost-of-living considerations.""The MPC may look through high food inflation if it is transitory; but in an environment of persisting high food inflation, as we are experiencing now, the MPC cannot afford to do so. It has to remain vigilant to prevent spillovers or second round effects from persistent food inflation and preserve the gains made so far in monetary policy credibility,"" Das had said.","Food inflation cannot be ignored as it has a high weight in the consumer price index (CPI) basket. Food inflation has remained high in the country over the past two years, complicating the policy choice. The latest Economic Survey had suggested excluding food prices from the inflation targeting framework.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115468555,imgsize-1220007,width-400,resizemode-4/115468555.jpg"

Railway Budget 2024 : The government has wavered little in its efforts to spur a modernisation of railways in the country, pivoting on technology, to support the country’s economic ambitions. In line with expectations, Union Budget 2024-25 set the capex for railways at a record Rs 2.65 lakh crore, marking yet another year of successive increase in outlay. That takes forward the past policies and the government’s vision, which have paved the way for modernisation of the transport behemoth.In earlier decades, the government had focused on laying tracks on new routes, electrification and incremental rolling stock capacity addition. That was the need of the hour back then and has helped set up the base for a larger transformation.For instance, the massive Dedicated Freight Corridor ( DFC ) as well as locomotive factories at Marhaura and Madhepura in Bihar were conceptualised over a decade ago and we are seeing their completion now.More recently, the focus has shifted to modernisation—of rolling stock and safety systems, among other aspects.This year, emphasis has also been laid on the railways’ crucial role in industrial development. Commodity-specific corridors have been planned in eastern India and impetus given to port connectivity. Vande Bharat and technology-led upgrades in rolling stock remain in focus. Safety has been prioritised through budgetary allocations for the anti-collision systemKavach . That said, there are other cogs in the wheel that demand attention from a long-term perspective.First, the target for the Operating Ratio, the crucial efficiency gauge, has been set at 98.22% for 2024-25, compared with 98.65% in 2023-24. This reflects an imminent need for operational transformation. An effective overhaul of the world’s fourth-largest rail network will take many years and thus we need to start focusing on improving efficiency and reducing costs now.DFC is almost entirely operational and will be complete over the next few months. To ensure the project achieves its twin goals of reducing logistics costs and enhancing freight efficiency, railways need to attract more cargo on the corridor. This will help increase the rail coefficient and make the railways’ approach more market-oriented, which will in turn aid future corridors.A revamp of railway stations is on track, with sufficient funds dedicated to this end. But even though new coaches and wagons are increasingly being added to meet footfalls, the stations and passenger trains themselves remain synonymous with chaos.Just as safety, comfort and convenience have been prioritised, there is a need for solutions to address the capacity and demand challenges. As a first step, the government could target development of new stations and setting up of new coach production units.As a leading freight mover, Indian Railways carried a record 1,588 MT cargo in fiscal 2024, up from 1,095 MT in fiscal 2015. It accounts for 26% of the cargo moved in the country—by no means an easy feat. The railways aims to take this volume to 3,000 MT by 2030, which would require a 11% CAGR against the around 4.2% witnessed over the last 10 years. As per a report by TERI and Shakti Foundation, from carrying about 62% of freight traffic in 1990-91, Indian Railways’ share has declined to ~27% in 2014-15. This has been due to the expanding road network, cost competitiveness over railways, and door-to-door service. Thus, commencing the cycle of increasing the rail share again is commendable.DFCs, a high-capacity track network, high-power locomotives and improvement in wagon designs have set the ball rolling for larger capacity, faster freight trains that deliver better efficiency.Yet, achieving exponential growth is a tall ask given the current dynamics. Possibly, similar challenges might apply to other goals the railways might have for 2047.To be fair, despite its scale and complexity, Indian Railways has been able to achieve diverse developments at commendable speed.But the track ahead is long and it is time to start discussing the reinvention of the institutional set-up.Indian Railways sees substantial private sector involvement in the form of vendors and contractors. Policymakers could start mulling extreme options such as parallel privately-owned and operated railway infrastructure, coupled with centralised planning and an evolved role for the railways. This will need a robust policy framework from the Government of India.The time is perhaps also ripe to bring user charge and asset monetisation-driven segments for passengers as well as cargo to the discussion table. Globally, the separation of infrastructure and operations in railways has delivered mixed results, for example in the United Kingdom. The model should be analysed and revisited to understand its potential relevance in the Indian context.The key would be to retrace our steps and align our long-term goals to identify not just incremental changes but also ways to explore bold and path-breaking alternatives that put Indian Railways on a smooth track and bring it up to speed.","Union Budget 2024-25 set the capex for railways at a record Rs 2.65 lakh crore.

Budget 2024 capital gains tax changes: The Narendra Modi government is considering suggestions for tweaks in the new long term capital gains tax regime that was announced by FM Nirmala Sitharaman in Union Budget 2024.The July 23 budget reduced the LTCG tax on property from 20% to 12.5%. The indexation benefit, which allowed taxpayers to adjust the acquisition cost for inflation before calculating capital gains and thus reduce their tax liability, is proposed to be eliminated for properties purchased on or after April 1, 2001. The government publishes the Cost Inflation Index (CII) annually for this calculation.India Inc is appealing to the government for a gradual shift to the long-term capital gains tax regime proposed in the FY25 budget, which aims to eliminate indexation benefits for property, gold, and other unlisted assets.According to an ET report by Deepshikha Sikarwar, the industry is suggesting alternatives such as a higher tax rate with indexation or a lower rate of 12.5% without indexation, as well as some form of grandfathering for ancestral properties.The finance ministry is currently reviewing these proposals and will discuss them with the Prime Minister's Office.

Budget 2024 for manufacturing sector : The recent Union Budget has struck a balance between fiscal consolidation and stimulating economic growth. While the middle class has been offered tax relief, the government's primary focus remains on judicious spending to maximize economic impact. The budget's core themes are employment, skilling, MSME development, and support for the middle class.Largely focus has remained intact on spending money judiciously to ensure that each penny spent creates a ripple effect in the entire economic landscape.Although at first glance, manufacturing might appear to have taken a backseat, a deeper analysis reveals a multifaceted approach to bolstering the sector. Initiatives like employment-linked benefits and internship programs, while primarily aimed at job creation and skill development, indirectly benefit manufacturing companies by expanding the talent pool.Extensive focus on the MSME manufacturing units by way of extending term loan facility for purchase of machinery and equipment without collateral or third-party guarantee, would help companies in augmenting their capital base/ capacity and strengthen the very foundation of the manufacturing ecosystem in the country. Development of a new credit-assessment model by Public Sector Banks to assess MSME credit shall provide much needed regulatory relief to the units.With respect to the large manufacturing entities, while there is no direct fiscal/ tax incentive introduced in this budget, some support has been provided with an extensive focus on development of ‘industrial parks’ in nearly 100 cities under the ‘plug and play’ model. Reforms proposed with respect to land administration, planning and management, shall also ease out acquisition related difficulties often faced by entrepreneurs/ business houses in acquiring lands for manufacturing set-ups.Targeted Customs duty interventions like, rationalization of Customs duty provisions in Mobile phone manufacturing setups, extension of Customs duty exemption on import of capital goods for manufacturing of solar cells and panels, full Customs duty exemption on import of 25 critical minerals,, shall provide the required impetus for enhancing domestic manufacturing environment.Governments’ focus on formulating an Economic Policy Framework to set the scope for next-gen reforms in the country, has a target to improve the productivity of factors of production, namely, land, labour, capital, entrepreneurship and technology. This shall pave the way for enabling achievement of a target of 25% manufacturing sector contribution to the nation’s GDP over the course of next 7-10 years.While the overall outlook is positive, the extension of tax benefits under Section 115BAB for manufacturing entities and the absence of new PLI schemes are notable omissions.The country’s manufacturing base is expanding as is reflective from the continuously increasing tax collections and expanding Purchasing Manager’s Index. It would be pertinent to see how the ground realities evolve vis-à-vis the vision envisaged, in the upcoming Financial Year.","While the overall outlook is positive, the extension of tax benefits under Section 115BAB for manufacturing entities and the absence of new PLI schemes are notable omissions.

Budget 2024: Armed with the vision to propel India to become a developed country by 2047, the Union Budget 2024 aims to focus largely towards strengthening the Make in India initiative and ease of doing business thereby providing the required stimulus to the manufacturing sector and enabling large scale job creation.On the Indirect tax front, the industry welcomes the much-needed announcement for a comprehensive review of the rate structure under Customs enabling ease in product classification and dispute reduction. The proposal of lowering of Customs duty on a plethora of raw materials and products including solar cells, critical minerals and bullion are encouraging measures. The rationale behind such reduction clearly indicates support towards domestic manufacturing, deepening value addition and supporting targets in reducing carbon footprint.Relevant amendments under the Customs law have been made to provide increased time limits for re-imports and re-exports to enhance competitiveness of the fledgling MRO sector. The government has extended significant duty reduction and exemption benefits to the healthcare and electronics sectors, continuing the impetus of incentives provided under the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme.Since their introduction in March 2020, the PLI schemes have indeed supported in revitalizing the manufacturing sector and strengthening the necessary supply chains. The success achieved in the mobile manufacturing sector has now enabled the Government to reduce customs duties on mobile phones and components, signalling a mature environment. The Budget proposals aim at reproducing similar outcomes for semiconductor and pharmaceutical industry by increasing the budgetary allocation.Buoyed by the increasing revenue collection under GST signalling a shift towards a mature tax regime, this Budget has harmonized the timeframes for the issuance of demand notices and adjudication orders for cases involving fraud, suppression or otherwise. Significant amendments to the GST legislations have been introduced reflecting the recommendations proposed by the GST Council such as regularizing non-levy of GST due to general practice which may turn out to be a breather for certain impacted industries reeling under huge tax demands.The Insurance sector has been provided much relief through the GST council recommendations which have been cemented in the present budget thereby ending long standing disputes on their business practices.The Government's efforts to push forward with its reform agenda are evident as plans to incentivize states for their business reform actions plans and digitalization through the Jan Vishwas Bill 2.0 is proposed. Further, setting up of e-commerce export hubs is envisaged to facilitate easier access to international markets for domestic players.The recent implementation of Budget proposals allows the government to maintain momentum in its reform agenda. These policy measures implicitly reaffirm the significance of India Inc as a crucial element in the development of infrastructure. However, there are still some expectations required to be met to march towards a Viksit Bharat 2047.","Union Budget 2024 aims to focus largely towards strengthening the Make in India initiative.

Budget 2024 : Real estate, a significant contributor to employment generation, has received a fair bit of attention in Budget 2024-25. Recent years have seen the sector transform rapidly, driven by factors such as favourable government policies, Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016, strong economic growth and changing consumer preferences.Added to that, the budgetary focus on job creation, skilling and employment-linked incentives, infrastructure, urban development, rural connectivity, digitalisation and land-related norms, all dovetail to promote growth of the sector.Launched in June 2015, the PMAY aims to provide affordable housing to all eligible beneficiaries. The budget unveiled PMAY Urban 2.0, under which the housing needs of 1 crore urban poor and middle class will be addressed with an investment of Rs 10 lakh crore.The central government’s additional Rs 2.2 lakh crore injection in the next 5 years to make housing more affordable has the potential to revitalise the affordable housing market.Such an approach can play an important role in realising the government's vision of Housing for All and push growth and development. Hence, the significant investment under PMAY Urban 2.0 is expected to alleviate urban housing deficits, spurring construction and economic growth.Steps to introduce technological reforms within the regulatory framework for land, such as digitalisation or GIS mapping of land records, will improve transparency.Rationalisation of stamp duty across states will also be critical to bring in uniformity and initiate land-related reforms such as urban planning, usage and building bylaws.These are steps in the right direction and will boost growth. Moreover, they will improve the ease of property transactions and strengthen municipal finances through increased property taxes. Rationalization of stamp duty with an emphasis on women homebuyers may boost home-buyer sentiment in major cities, too.The budget has also given ample attention to urban and rural development, with rental housing for industrial workers through the public private partnership model, interest subsidies for rental housing, and transit-oriented developments.The proposal to develop investment-ready plug-and-play industrial parks in 100 cities may attract industrial investment, leading to increased demand for industrial real estate and support the growth of ancillary services and residential developments in these regions.Initiatives for industrial parks and rental housing for industrial workers align with the country’s manufacturing goals and addresses worker accommodation needs.These steps are expected to promote industrial growth and stability in labour-intensive sectors, while also creating new opportunities for real estate developers specialising in rental and affordable housing.The changes in long-term capital gains (LTCG) tax, however, have evoked a mixed reaction. The government lowered the long-term capital gains tax from 20% to 12.5%, which is a welcome step. However, this came with the removal of the indexation benefit.The changes could encourage more liquidity in property transactions and potentially increase the effective tax burden depending on the property’s acquisition date.The launch of Phase IV of the PM Gram Sadak Yojana in 25,000 rural habitations will improve connectivity in rural areas, promoting rural development and making these regions more accessible for investment. The primary objective of PMGSY is to build robust, all-weather roads in rural habitations. This initiative focuses on enhancing connectivity and supporting economic development in rural areas.In essence, the budget is geared towards stimulating growth and investment in the real estate sector , fostering a more transparent and investor-friendly environment, and contributing to overall development. It aims to create a balanced and inclusive growth environment by addressing the needs of various segments, including affordable housing, industrial workers and urban infrastructure.The effectiveness of the initiatives, however, hinges on their implementation and continued support of complementary reforms.",The central government’s additional Rs 2.2 lakh crore injection in the next 5 years to make housing more affordable has the potential to revitalise the affordable housing market.

New Budget 2024 rule: Why Income Tax Department is likely to issue a huge number of tax notices this month,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/new-budget-2024-rule-why-income-tax-department-is-likely-to-issue-a-huge-number-of-tax-notices-this-month/articleshow/112186079.cms,"Taxing Times

Income Tax Notice on the way? The Income Tax Department is gearing up to send out a large number of notices in the coming month, as there are concerns that many taxpayers might escape the tax net due to the impending implementation of the new reassessment law on September 1, 2024.According to the amended regulation announced in Budget 2024 , the tax authorities can only go back a maximum of five years to reassess a taxpayer's records if the escaped income is at least Rs 50 lakh, and three years for an amount less than Rs 50 lakh.Previously, they could reassess cases up to 10 years old.According to an ET report, tax officials are now faced with the challenge of compiling and corroborating data on tax and income mismatches for the financial years 2013-14 to 2017-18 within the next few weeks, as these years will become time-barred for reassessment from September 1, 2024.The I-T department relies on information from various sources, such as banks, property registrars, and search findings from the investigation wing, to build reassessment cases.A tax officers' body has raised concerns about the feasibility of issuing notices under Section 148 (or 148A) in a large number of cases within a single month, given the overburdened nature of the jurisdictional assessing officers and the time-consuming process of obtaining sanction from the chief commissioner, who is the specified authority for such notices.Moreover, the law provides taxpayers with the right to explain their position before reassessment orders are finalized, a process that most believe cannot be completed by the end of August.Also Read | ITR refund status for FY 2023-24: How to check income tax refund status online - here’s a step-by-step guide for incometax.gov.in & NSDL websites The Central Board of Direct Taxes ( CBDT ) has been urged by its officers to postpone the effective date of the proposed amendment. However, this suggestion is unlikely to be well-received by corporations and high net worth individuals.""Capping the reassessment period at five years was a great decision as it would reduce hassles and litigation. But if the department fears there could be a genuine loss of revenue as it may not be possible to wrap up several matters by August 31, the government can think of strict parameters where time-bound cases can be selectively reopened - based on trails of steps taken in identifying escaped income,"" said Mitil Chokshi, partner at CA firm Chokshi & Chokshi.""Taxpayers may expect a rush of reassessment notices in August 2024. These notices are likely to be for the AYs 2018-19 and prior to that. It is pertinent to note that the Bombay High Court in a recent ruling in a case of Hexaware Technologies has taken a view on a proviso introduced in 2021, which can be interpreted to mean that AY 2017-18 (and prior years) got time barred on March 31, 2024. These reassessment notices (for AYs 2017-18 and prior) are likely to rake up new interpretation issues in the already muddled reassessment provisions,"" said Ashish Mehta, partner at law firm Khaitan & Co.The current situation is similar to the conflict between the Income Tax office and taxpayers in 2021. The reassessment law was amended in April 2021, allowing the tax office to reopen 10-year-old tax returns if the total undisclosed income exceeded Rs 50 lakh and reassess 4-year-old matters if the amount was less than Rs 50 lakh.Also Read | Latest NPS rules 2024: How much tax will you save with new NPS contribution benefit under new regime after Budget 2024? However, this change led to over 10,000 writ petitions being filed by companies, arguing that they were not given sufficient time to explain and that the notices were issued without considering the carve-out that cases which couldn't be reopened earlier couldn't be reassessed under the new law.The Supreme Court invoked its extraordinary powers under Article 142 of the Constitution on May 4, 2022, to uphold all reassessment notices issued after March 31, 2021. However, the court left room for judicial proceedings based on the merits of each case, and several such matters are currently pending before the court.","The Income Tax Department is gearing up to send out a large number of notices in the coming month.

How NPS will increase tax savings

NPS and EPF: Overlapping services

What is NPS Vatsalaya?

Latest NPS rules, news: In the Union Budget 2024 speech, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced two new initiatives with regard to National Pension Scheme (NPS) - extension of NPS 14% employer contribution benefits to private setcor and the intended launch of NPS Vatsalya.Budget 2024 announced the hiking of the tax deduction limit on private sector employers’ contributions to NPS from 10% to 14% of employees’ basic salaries, bringing it at par with the provisions available for government employees.Sriram Iyer, CEO, HDFC Pension Management told ET that with this move the “ground rules have been harmonised among government and non-government employees, which is a positive step.”Effectively, this means that now, private-sector employees can choose to reduce the taxable portion of employers’ contribution to their NPS corpus, thereby paying less tax and leaving greater funds in their pension deposits.“Employees will benefit from tax savings . More importantly, the 40% increase in contribution will have a significant impact on the terminal value of the retirement corpus,” remarked Iyer. The extended savings will “help in retirement planning, working as an option that is at par with the Provident Fund,” Dinesh Rohira, CEO & Founder, 5nance.com was quoted as saying.Moreover, the endeavour aims to increase NPS penetration by increasing tax incentives for the private sector, providing them a social security-cushion post-retirement.The scheme’s motive to widen the NPS subscriber base may not prove to be flawlessly effective, however. This is explained by Agrees Mrin Agarwal, Founder, Finsafe India: “While it’s good that the limit has been raised, it may not increase adoption as employees need to be educated in a big way. Also, the benefit is only for the salaried opting for the new tax regime,” she says.The mandatory contribution to the EPF, too, threatens to relegate the provisions of NPS under the umbrella of near-superfluity. This sentiment is echoed by Varun Sahay, a software engineer in a Delhi-based IT company: “When 12% of my salary is already deducted for the EPF, why should I put in more in the NPS and cut my take-home pay?”Rohira feels otherwise. “There’s no competition between the NPS and EPF as employees can contribute to both and build a 3-4 times bigger corpus while earning 3-4% higher returns via marketlinked options in the NPS,” he counters.Also Check | New Tax Regime 2023 vs 2024 After Budget: How Much Income Tax Will Salaried Taxpayers Save & How Do New Tax Slabs Compare To Old Regime? Top 10 Points You Must Know To jumpstart retirement savings for children, a new initiative called NPS Vatsalya has been unveiled in the Budget. This scheme allows parents and guardians to contribute to a minor's account, which can be converted into a regular NPS account once the child reaches adulthood.""It provides a very long duration for reaping the compounding benefits and accumulating a huge bounty at a later age. This can be a good way to plan a better future for kids who may not opt for a service segment in the future,"" says Rohira. Sriram Iyer agrees, stating, ""It’s a good move to help the child start his retirement journey. Even if a parent starts when the child is 10 years old, by the time he starts working, it can be a solid foundation for the compounding journey after that.""However, some experts question the utility of a product with such a long lock-in period, especially when parents cannot use the funds for essential goals like their child’s education amidst soaring education costs of 11-12%.""Parents are struggling to save for their own retirement, so it might be a bit of a stretch to expect them to save for their kids’ retirement. The need of the hour is a market-linked product that allows withdrawals only for the child’s education,"" says Mrin Agarwal, Founder of Finsafe India.Also Read | Latest NPS rules 2024: How much tax will you save with new NPS contribution benefit under new regime after Budget 2024? Though the NPS permits partial withdrawals, it allows only 25% of the corpus after three years of joining, and this can be done only three times during the entire tenure. A premature exit before 60 years with 100% withdrawal is only possible if the corpus is less than Rs.2.5 lakh, an amount insufficient for most children's goals.""In its current form, there won’t be any uptake,"" asserts Agarwal. Rohira concurs, ""It’s a vanilla product with a lock-in, which does not make it very attractive and it may not take off. However, the government may optimise it and introduce new features later."" Iyer adds, ""This is just a start and there may be more subscriber-friendly features as we take it to the market. The regulator is proactive and open to feedback.""","Budget 2024 announced the hiking of the tax deduction limit on private sector employers’ contributions to NPS from 10% to 14% of employees’ basic salaries.

Gold import duty cut: Why Indians may not find buying gold from Dubai as attractive post Budget 2024,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/gold-import-duty-cut-why-indians-may-not-find-buying-gold-from-dubai-as-attractive-post-budget-2024/articleshow/112097671.cms,"Gold import duty cut: Joy Alukkas, chairman of Joy Alukkas Group, estimates that nearly 50% of their UAE business will shift to India.

Gold import duty cut in Budget 2024: The recent reduction in customs duty on gold imports in the Union Budget 2024 is expected to significantly impact the gold shopping habits of Indian consumers who frequently visit Dubai. Indian jewellers with stores in both India and the UAE believe that the narrowed duty differential will result in lower gold prices in India, making it less attractive for Indians to purchase gold in Dubai.The emirate had attracted gold-enthusiast Indians following a steep rise in customs duty in India in July 2022. In the fiscal 2024-25 budget, the duty on gold imports was more than halved.The duty cut is also expected to boost gold jewellery production in India, particularly the popular 'Kolkatti' jewellery from Kolkata, which is favored by Indian expats in Dubai and tourists from various countries. This move will encourage gold artisans to create new designs in both heavyweight and lightweight jewellery, attracting consumers to purchase gold from India.According to an ET report, Joy Alukkas, chairman of Joy Alukkas Group , estimates that nearly 50% of their UAE business will shift to India as Indian tourists who previously bought jewellery in Dubai will now prefer to shop in India. However, Indian expats living in Dubai and other customers may continue to buy from the UAE.Also Read | Gold losing sheen? Government cuts gold bond issuance target as investors look at better alternatives Rajiv Popley, director at Popley & Sons, believes that the perception of overseas gold being cheaper than in India is merely a mindset. He points out that the labour cost is significantly lower in India, and with the introduction of mandatory hallmarking and HUID numbers, the purity of gold in India is no longer a concern.Furthermore, NRIs in Dubai do not receive VAT refunds, and Indians travelling abroad only receive about 60% of the VAT back on their gold purchases. Gold trade analyst Bhargav Baidya suggests that the 1% duty differential between gold jewellery in India and Dubai will be offset by Indian jewellers offering discounts to retain and attract customers.Saurabh Gadgil, chairman of PNG Jewellers, notes that Indian import duty is now on par with the US, allowing Indian jewellers to offer competitive prices compared to other countries worldwide. The reduced customs duty is expected to make gold purchases in India more attractive and convenient for Indian consumers, potentially leading to a significant shift in their gold shopping preferences.","The reduction in customs duty on gold imports in the Union Budget 2024 is expected to significantly impact the gold shopping habits of Indian consumers.

Gold Bonds losing sheen

Gold losing sheen? The government has reduced its target for issuing gold bonds in the financial year 2024-25 by 38% compared to the previous interim budget goal, according to a senior official. The revised target stands at Rs 18,500 crore, down from Rs 29,638 crore estimated in the interim budget and Rs 26,852 crore (revised estimate) in 2023-24.The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told ET ""The decision followed a reassessment of various factors, including investor demand, other investment products and uncertainties around the global economy, as the situation has changed since the interim budget in February.""After accounting for redemptions, the net issuances of sovereign gold bonds are now estimated at Rs 15,000 crore for this fiscal year, a significant decrease from the Rs 26,138 crore projected in the interim budget and Rs 25,352 crore in the revised estimate for 2023-24.Harish Galipelli, director at ILA Commodities India, attributed this shift to retail investors increasingly opting for equities in anticipation of better returns. He also noted that people are uncertain about the potential for further increases in gold prices in the short-to-medium term following a recent rally. Additionally, Galipelli pointed out that savings in rural areas have been impacted by retail inflation and other factors.The gold bond and gold monetisation schemes were introduced by the government in late 2015 to discourage the physical purchase of precious metals and reduce imports, thereby mitigating the negative impact on the current account deficit.The gross collection through these two schemes is now projected to be Rs 20,030 crore in 2024-25, compared to Rs 31,168 crore in the interim budget and Rs 28,240 crore (revised estimate) in the previous fiscal year. Similarly, the net collection is estimated at Rs 16,433 crore, down from Rs 27,571 crore in the interim budget and Rs 26,653 crore in the previous year. However, the estimates for the gold monetisation scheme remain unchanged from the interim budget level.Also Read | Budget 2024: Duty cuts on gold, silver, platinum, and diamonds to make jewellery more affordable The sovereign gold bond scheme targets investors who view gold as an investment, encouraging them to purchase paper gold instead of physical gold.On the other hand, the gold monetisation scheme aims to bring out idle gold held by households, temple trusts, and others to increase domestic supply. Both schemes were designed to curb gold imports, which, along with crude oil, have been significant contributors to India's current account deficit. Gold bond issuances had moderated after reaching Rs 16,049 crore during the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020-21, before experiencing a surge in 2023-24.","The government has reduced its target for issuing gold bonds in the financial year 2024-25 by 38% compared to the previous interim budget goal.

Insurance mis-selling: Irdai cautions banks,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/insurance-mis-selling-irdai-cautions-banks/articleshow/115468089.cms,"MUMBAI: The insurance regulator's chief on Tuesday cautioned banks against mis-selling of insurance products, stating that a lot of ills have crept into the bancassurance system.Irdai chief Debasish Panda said that banks have relationships with customers for generations because of which there is a trust that the branch would sell them right product at the right price. ""We all need to sit together and thrash out the matter so that we restore the confidence and this becomes a low-cost distribution model. You do not have to run after customers, you have to give them an option. I believe there is merit in the system, but we have to do it with caution so that you don't forget your activity and start selling only insurance. It should be incidental,"" said Panda. He was speaking at the SBI Conclave here.Panda's comments come close on the heels of FM Nirmala Sitharaman's caution against mis-selling and echoes her stance that banks should stick to their primary activity. In the past, there have been instances of banks asking even senior citizen customers to park their savings in schemes of insurance companies. Shares of life insurance companies fell sharply on Tuesday after Sitharaman's comments as banks are the biggest distributors for private life companies and any curbs could lead to a drop in sales.Last year the Irdai's amended product regulations placed the onus on insurance companies to ensure that companies take reasonable care to ensure suitability of the policy to the prospects/policyholders. This shifted the onus to the insurer to ensure that the policy is suitable to the needs of the customer and ensure that they have the wherewithal to pay renewal premium.Panda said that the number of regulations in the sector has been significantly reduced from over 100 to just 20, of which only 15 apply to the industry, as the remaining five are internal to organizations. These regulations are principle-based, offering more flexibility. Morever, over 375 circulars have been repealed, and more than 80 returns have been simplified, aiming to encourage innovation, ease business operations, and lower compliance burdens.Boards now have greater autonomy to make business and operational decisions independently, as many redundant prior approvals from the regulator have been eliminated. Processes have been streamlined across various areas, including entering the insurance sector, launching products, managing expenses, raising capital, and investing assets. This provides more opportunities and flexibility, especially for new entrants, he said. Earlier in his speech, Panda said that the Indian insurance sector is the 10th largest globally and is projected to become the sixth biggest within 7-8 years.",Irdai chief Debasish Panda said that banks have relationships with customers for generations because of which there is a trust.

The IMF team on Sunday arrived in Sri Lanka to carry out the third review of the nearly USD 3 billion bailout facility.The third review should lead to the fourth tranche of the 4-year facility. It would be around 330 million dollars as was the case in the previous three tranches, Finance Ministry officials said.Sri Lanka's economic reform programme is supported by the IMF's Extended Fund Facility (EFF).Dissanayake met the IMF's Sri Lanka mission chief Peter Breuer and the delegation.He urged the IMF team to consider the economic hardships faced by the people and strike a balance in the economic recovery programme, the release added.In his presidential election campaign, President Dissanayake vowed to renegotiate the IMF to water down hard conditions laid down for the recovery.Dissanayake's National People's Power (NPP) was highly critical of the cost recovery-based utility tariffs and high taxes which came conditional to the bailout.The IMF team had earlier met the former president Ranil Wickremesinghe who had successfully steered the IMF programme for economic recovery as a result Sri Lanka was described as one of the quickest to recover from a crippling economic crisis.Sri Lanka plunged into an economic crisis when the island nation declared sovereign default in mid-April of 2022, its first since gaining independence from Britain in 1948. Almost civil-war-like conditions and months of public protests led to the fleeing of the then president Gotabaya Rajapaksa.""The IMF delegation praised our two-year efforts to achieve recovery they warned that deviation from it can mean hardships again for the local economy,"" Shehan Semasinghe one of the junior ministers under the Wickremesinghe administration, who was responsible for the IMF negotiations, said.Wickremesinghe's IMF-dictated reforms became unpopular and he finished third behind Dissanayake in the September presidential election.Dissanayake's NPP recorded a resounding victory at last week's parliamentary election winning absolute control of the House.",The IMF team on Sunday arrived in Sri Lanka to carry out the third review of the nearly USD 3 billion bailout facility.

Stocks fell and global bonds climbed on worries over the latest escalation in Russia’s war against Ukraine.S&P 500 futures dipped 0.4%, paring earlier losses as Walmart Inc. rallied about 4% in premarket trading after boosting its outlook. The yield on 10-year Treasuries fell six basis points to 4.36%. The moves were steeper in Europe, with German bond yields dropping to the lowest since October and the stocks benchmark losing 1%. Poland’s main stock index sank more than 3%.Markets were rattled by reports that Ukrainian forces reportedly carried out their first strike on a border region in Russia using Western-supplied missiles. Earlier, President Vladimir Putin had approved an updated nuclear doctrine that expanded the conditions for Russia to use atomic weapons, including in response to a massive conventional attack on its soil. Putin had pledged in September to revise the doctrine.“For the moment the market reaction is contained,” said Andrea Tueni, head of sales trading at Saxo Banque France. “Some are still in a wait-and see-mode.”Traditional haven assets including the Japanese yen, Swiss franc and gold gained. Ukraine’s sovereign dollar bonds fell the most among emerging-market peers.In commodities, natural-gas futures advanced as much as 1.1%, trading near their highest levels in a year. Gold was up 0.7% at $2,630 an ounce. Oil traders, meanwhile, appeared unfazed, with prices falling after Europe’s largest oil field gradually restarted following a power outage.The sudden repricing underscored how vulnerable markets remain to any flare-up in the conflict. It cut short a long losing streak for Treasuries, which had broadly sold off since mid-September on expectations Donald Trump’s policies will boost growth and rekindle inflation.Trump’s pending nomination of a Treasury secretary and the impact that will have on policy was also front and center on Tuesday. The transition team is considering pairing Kevin Warsh, a former Federal Reserve official, in the Treasury secretary role, with hedge fund manager Scott Bessent as director of the White House’s National Economic Council, according to people familiar with the matter.“Kevin Warsh was in the FOMC, so the likelihood of political interference into the Fed policy making is certainly diminishing if he were to become the Treasury secretary,” said Gero Jung, chief economist of Mirabaud Asset Management in Geneva.Meanwhile, Bitcoin is back in the vicinity of an all-time high, climbing above $92,000.

Google appeal

AI overviews

Top Justice Department antitrust officials have decided to ask a judge to force Alphabet Inc.’s Google to sell off its Chrome browser in what would be a historic crackdown on one of the world’s biggest tech companies.The department will ask the judge, who ruled in August that Google illegally monopolized the search market, to require measures related to artificial intelligence and its Android smartphone operating system, according to people familiar with the plans.Antitrust officials, along with states that have joined the case, also plan to recommend Wednesday that federal judge Amit Mehta impose data licensing requirements, said the people, who asked not to be named discussing a confidential matter.If Mehta accepts the proposals, they have the potential to reshape the online search market and the burgeoning AI industry. The case was filed under the first Trump administration and continued under President Joe Biden . It marks the most aggressive effort to rein in a technology company since Washington unsuccessfully sought to break up Microsoft Corp. two decades ago.Owning the world’s most popular web browser is key for Google’s ads business. The company is able to see activity from signed-in users, and use that data to more effectively target promotions, which generate the bulk of its revenue. Google has also been using Chrome to direct users to its flagship AI product, Gemini, which has the potential to evolve from an answer-bot to an assistant that follows users around the web.Lee-Anne Mulholland, Google’s vice president of regulatory affairs, said the Justice Department “continues to push a radical agenda that goes far beyond the legal issues in this case.” She added, “the government putting its thumb on the scale in these ways would harm consumers, developers and American technological leadership at precisely the moment it is most needed.”The Justice Department declined to comment.Google shares fell as much as 1.8% to $172.16 in late trading. They had been up 25% this year through the close.Antitrust enforcers want the judge to order Google to sell off Chrome — the most widely used browser worldwide — because it represents a key access point through which many people use its search engine, the people said.The government has the option to decide whether a Chrome sale is necessary at a later date if some of the other aspects of the remedy create a more competitive market, the people added. The Chrome browser controls about 61% of the market in the US, according to StatCounter , a web traffic analytics service.Government attorneys met with dozens of companies over the past three months as they prepared the recommendation. States are still considering adding some proposals and some details could change, the people said.The antitrust officials pulled back from a more severe option that would have forced Google to sell off Android, the people said.Alphabet’s Google Bracing for Antitrust Rigmarole: Legal OutlookMehta’s August ruling that Google broke antitrust laws in both online search and search text ads markets followed a 10-week trial last year. The company has said it plans to appeal.The judge has set a two-week hearing in April on what changes Google must make to remedy the illegal behavior and plans to issue a final ruling by August 2025.The agency and the states have settled on recommending that Google be required to license the results and data from its popular search engine and give websites more options to prevent their content from being used by Google’s artificial intelligence products, said the people.The antitrust enforcers are set to propose that Google uncouple its Android smartphone operating system from its other products, including search and its Google Play mobile app store, which are now sold as a bundle, the people said. They are also prepared to seek a requirement that Google share more information with advertisers and give them more control over where their ads appear.Read more: US Weighs Google Breakup in Historic Big Tech Antitrust Case Lawyers from the Justice Department and state attorneys general included all of those options in an initial filing in October, as well as a ban on the type of exclusive contracts that were at the center of the case against Google.A forced spin-off, if it happens, would also hinge on finding an interested buyer. Those who could afford and might want the property, like Amazon.com Inc., are also facing antitrust scrutiny that may prevent such a mega-deal.“My view is this is extremely unlikely,” Mandeep Singh , a Bloomberg Intelligence analyst, said in an email. But, he added, he could see a buyer like OpenAI, the maker of artificial intelligence chatbot ChatGPT. “That would give it both distribution and an ads business to complement its consumer chatbot subscriptions.”Google now displays artificial intelligence-based answers at the top of its search pages billed as “AI Overviews.” While websites can opt-out of having their information used by Google to create AI models, they can’t afford to opt out of the overviews because that would risk pushing them down in search results, making it harder to reach their customers.Website publishers have complained that the feature dampens traffic and advertising dollars since users rarely click through to see the data being used to power those results.Earlier: Google’s AI Search Gives Sites Dire Choice: Share Data or Die Regarding data licensing, the antitrust enforcers plan to propose two options: That Google sell the underlying “click and query” data and also separately syndicate its search results, according to the people.The company currently sells syndicated search results, but with restrictions, such as preventing their use on mobile. Forcing Google to syndicate its search results would allow rival search engines and AI startups to quickly improve their quality, while the data feed would allow others to build their own search index.",Antitrust enforcers want the judge to order Google to sell off Chrome. Google shares fell as much as 1.8% to $172.16 in late trading.

Spirit Airlines files for bankruptcy protection,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/spirit-airlines-files-for-bankruptcy-protection/articleshow/115427031.cms,"Spirit Airlines has filed for bankruptcy protection after the pioneer of no-frills travel in the U.S. struggled with a long run of quarterly losses and significant debt, it disclosed on Monday.The airline's woes deepened after the collapse of its $3.8 billion planned merger with JetBlue Airways in January and the impact of RTX's Pratt & Whitney Geared Turbofan (GTF) engines snag that has grounded many of its aircraft.Spirit, recognized for its bright yellow livery, had been losing money despite strong travel demand, as it struggled with bloated costs.The airline has entered into an agreement with its bondholders that is expected to reduce total debt and provide increased financial flexibility, it said on Monday.Spirit started out as a long-haul trucking company in 1964 before shifting to aviation around 1983. It offered leisure packages to popular destinations under the name Charter One Airlines and rebranded to Spirit in 1992.The discount carrier became popular with budget-conscious customers willing to forego amenities like checked bags and seat assignments.Ultra-low-cost carriers, which excelled at keeping their expenses low and offering affordable, no-frills travel, have struggled since the pandemic as travelers prefer to pay extra for a more comfortable journey as they pursue experiences.Spirit's troubles, along with those at some of its rival budget carriers, have spurred talks of a flawed business model among some Wall Street analysts.","Spirit, recognized for its bright yellow livery, had been losing money despite strong travel demand, as it struggled with bloated costs.

If you're seeking coloured contacts that complement your warm autumn tones, you’re in the right place! Warm autumn colours are all about deep earth tones, creating a cosy, elegant look.We’ll guide you through selecting brown and grey lenses that suit your unique style, ensuring you achieve a harmonious look with your personal colour palette.A personal colour refers to a palette of colours that complement an individual's natural skin tone, hair colour, and eye colour. These colours are generally categorised into two main types: ""yellow base"" and ""blue base.""Warm Autumn, or yellow-based autumn, is characterised by a strong affinity for deep earth tones, making these shades particularly flattering for individuals with warm, yellowish undertones.Warm Autumn individuals often have deep, rich eye colours, such as dark brown or black. When choosing coloured contacts, it's important to select warm hues that blend well with their natural eye colour. Conversely, cool tones like blue or pastel shades tend to clash with their skin tone and may make their complexion appear dull.Warm Autumn individuals are known for their warm, calming presence and chic elegance. Here are some tips for selecting brown-colored contacts that accentuate these qualities.Rich, yellow-toned shadesWarm autumn features a yellow undertone in their skin, so it’s essential to choose colored contacts that are deep and warm, rather than cool-toned or blue shades.Contacts with bold edges can make the eyes appear more defined and prominent, while those with a blurred edge create a soft, gentle look. Choose a lens based on the vibe you want to achieve.Coloured contacts with a shiny or luminous finish can make your eyes look vibrant and add a touch of glamour to your overall look.Brown: The steady-seller brown is a versatile colour that is easy to match with any makeup look for warm autumn. Choosing a deep brown will give you a more mature and sophisticated impression.Gold: Gold combines both glamour and elegance, and brightens the skin tone of the autumn season.Khaki: This colour gives off a mysterious and cool impression.Terracotta: The terracotta colour brings out the red colour unique to you and creates a sophisticated look with a sense of being lost.For many warm autumn individuals, grey coloured contacts might seem challenging to choose. However, by focusing on a few key points, you can achieve a refined and attractive eye look with grey tones.It’s important to select grey contacts that have yellow undertones, as these will harmonise better with your skin tone. Avoid blue-toned greys, as they can make your complexion appear dull.Instead of opting for solid grey contacts, consider designs that incorporate warm colours like brown or beige. This combination will create a more complementary look for warm autumn individuals.Choosing contacts with a defined border can help emphasise the eyes and create a clean, polished appearance. On the other hand, blurred-edge designs can provide a softer, gentler look.Hazel: A mix of yellow-brown and grey, it is a colour that is naturally familiar to the eyes of autumn leafAsh brown: A mix of ash grey and brown, completes a sophisticated look with a sense of loss.Mocha grey: A mix of mocha brown and grey, gives a sophisticated, adult impression.Brown coloured contacts complement warm autumn skin and eye tones beautifully. Since these contacts aren’t overly bold, they allow for versatile makeup styles. To enhance the charm of warm autumn, it's essential to coordinate your look with warm colour tones.For example, applying bright shades like gold or bronze to your eye shadow can enhance the beauty and impact of your eyes. Similarly, choosing warm beige or orange, brown for your lips will harmonise with your skin tone, resulting in a more natural and attractive appearance.When wearing a grey-based lens we recommend using slightly smoky and calm tones such as pink, beige, and greige. It matches the wonderful atmosphere of grey-based colour tones while leaving behind the warmth of autumn.Warm autumn eyes typically feature yellow and red undertones. Opting for brown coloured contacts will allow the colour to seamlessly blend with your natural eye shade, resulting in a soft and harmonious appearance. To achieve an even more blended look, consider using contacts with a ""no border"" design that merges effortlessly with your eyes, or a ""dot pattern"" that adds depth and creates a naturally larger effect.When choosing a colour cone, the key point is to check the ""DIA (lens diameter)"" or ""tinted diameter."" A tinted diameter of 13.1 mm or less will give the impression that is almost the same as the naked eye, while around 13.3 mm will naturally make your eye pupils look larger.For the most up-to-date information about beauty trends and popular contact lens colour, you may want to consult recent markets.

As cryptocurrency trends escalate, investors try to find high-potential tokens that, within a given period, will provide them with substantial growth. Some of these include Rexas Finance , Tron , Uniswap , Ripple Avalanche , and Dogecoin. Each of these tokens has specific strengths and growth potentials, making them easy to recommend for those who wish to increase their profits within a 3-month timeframe.With its novel asset tokenization approach that connects real-world assets with blockchain, Rexas Finance (RXS) is poised to carve out a niche in an emerging market. RXS facilitates investment by enabling a large number of individuals to collectively own a small proportion of high-value assets such as real estate and intellectual assets. Recently audited by Certik, a trusted brand in blockchain security, RXS now offers an added layer of transparency and security, which further enhances investor confidence. Sold at a mere $0.07 while in the fifth stage of its presale, Rexas Finance has begun collecting over $6.2 million and sold approximately 121 million tokens. The sales figures reveal a well-sought asset in the market.One of the investment propositions of Rexas Finance is its capacity to tokenize assets safely and transparently, enhancing liquidity and ownership accessibility through blockchain technology. Early investors also have the prospect of drawing substantial returns since the upcoming listing price is pegged at $0.20. Meanwhile, Rexas Finance is creating additional traction as it gives out funds worth $1 million to the community. Marketed as a token for high utility, RXS’s presale and its roadmap toward exchange listing depict its future massive growth potential.As a blockchain platform through which applications can be created (dApps) and content distributed, Tron (TRX) is characterised by high-speed and low-cost transactions. With a trading price of about $0.16, Tron is now garnering a name as a preferred network for developers looking for scalability at a low cost. Justin Sun , Tron’s founder, has made it his business strategy to continue diversifying Tron’s uses through partnerships in the entertainment industry, DeFi, and other sectors. TRX's low transaction fee and strong foothold in the Asian market give it an upper hand against competitors. As the network gains more dApps andDeFi projects, TRX's price may gradually increase, given the rising interest in decentralized networks. A solid expansion plan and ecosystem earn Tron a great position for both short- and long-term investments.At a price of about $8.89, the Uniswap token remains one of the leading, if not the leading, dedicated decentralized exchanges. Uniswap’s AMM model allows users to swap tokens from their wallets at their convenience without needing to order books and other complex tools. With increased DeFi adoption, Uniswap’s user-friendly model has gained more popularity.Presently trading at $0.54, Ripple has a larger upside as it settles its ongoing legal issues with the SEC. XRP has a low price, making it accessible to the average investor. Ripple has multiple partnerships with global lenders, further establishing its credibility in cross-border transactions. Like others in the industry, Ripple has a network of partnerships and infrastructure, making it a favourite once stability returns to financial markets. Should the lawsuit be resolved, the market could see a surge in institutions using XRP, greatly enhancing its USD value.Avalanche, currently trading at $28.81, claims to support thousands of transactions per second, significantly speeding up transaction processing. With the rise in demand for faster solutions in DeFi applications, NFTs, and other dApps, AVAX is increasingly favoured. Given the growing DeFi and NFT markets, AVAX could appreciate value due to its advanced architecture. As the DeFi ecosystem grows, AVAX’s low transaction fees and throughput make it attractive to developers. The continuous expansion of DeFi suggests a likely increase in projects on Avalanche, raising demand for AVAX and its price.Dogecoin trades at $0.20 and was initially perceived as a joke. However, it has gained global recognition and a dedicated community. Although it began as a meme, DOGE surged into the mainstream with support from high-profile figures, establishing itself as a unique cryptocurrency. Despite its meme roots, Dogecoin attracts attention, especially when market sentiment improves. Relying on community and social buzz makes Dogecoin more volatile than other assets on this list. However, its recognition and appeal make sense from a short-term perspective. Dogecoin’s high-profile nature can yield quick returns in bull markets, though investors should remember its speculative nature.Each of these altcoins—Rexas Finance, Tron, Uniswap, Ripple, Avalanche, and Dogecoin—offers unique advantages to supporters. For active traders seeking returns in the next few months, including these assets allows for broader exposure across the crypto ecosystem, encompassing DeFi, tokenization, cross-border payments, and community assets. Rexas Finance tops the list with its innovative asset tokenization model, which adds practical value and attention to its presales. Uniswap and Avalanche add strong DeFi applications to a portfolio, while Tron provides low-fee, rapid transactions. Ripple supports cross-border payments, and Dogecoin rounds out the list with its cultural significance. In a bullish market, these altcoins have considerable growth potential, offering excellent returns that are rare in any portfolio.","rexas Finance, Tron, Uniswap, Ripple Avalanche, and Dogecoin.

Brazil's super rich tax proposal may get stuck,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/brazils-super-rich-tax-proposal-may-get-stuck/articleshow/115397259.cms,"NEW DELHI: Brazil's proposal to tax the super-rich is unlikely to be carried through when leaders of the G20 meet in Rio De Janeiro later this week as the original plan has been ""significantly diluted"" due to the stiff resistance from developed countries.Under its G20 Presidency, Brazil had proposed a 2% minimum tax on the ultra-rich, which is expected to yield up to $250 billion annually and help greater global cooperation to end tax evasion. The proposal was based on a report prepared by French economist Gabriel Zucman.The report refers to a progressive taxation approach that would affect around 3,000 individuals, who own fortunes of over one billion dollars - distributed in assets, real estate, shares and company ownership, among others - who do not yet pay at least 2% in annual income tax, according to a document on the G20 Brazil website. This, the report said, would affect only ultra-high net worth individuals with low tax payments.""The proposal has been significantly diluted as the G7 countries have strongly opposed any such move,"" said a source. The draft of the international declaration on taxes discussed at the finance track states that ""with full respect to tax sovereignty we are seeking to engage cooperatively to ensure that ultra-high net worth individuals are effectively taxed.""It also refers to the fact that these individuals are progressively taxed, while applauding ""the domestic tax reforms carried out by several G20 countries to tackle inequalities and promote fairer and more progressive tax systems recently.""Sources told TOI that intense discussions were underway to finalise a communique ahead of the leaders' summit, which begins on Monday against the backdrop of geopolitical tensions and the aftermath of presidential election results in the US.Pressure has been mounted on the G20 group of developed and emerging economies to approve the proposal to tax the super-rich and help plug the financing gaps in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG).""Taxing the world's billionaires provides an equitable pathway to generate much-needed additional resources to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals. A transfer of just 0.14% of global income could allow eradication of poverty by 2030,"" UN experts said in a statement.","Under its G20 Presidency, Brazil had proposed a 2% minimum tax on the ultra- rich.

Pakistan discusses $7 billion bailout reform agenda with IMF in unusual talks,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/pakistan-discusses-7-billion-bailout-reform-agenda-with-imf-in-unusual-talks/articleshow/115391436.cms,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan discussed its $7 billion bailout reform agenda with the International Monetary Fund during an unscheduled staff visit last week, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb said on Sunday, suggesting no new taxes are to be imposed.The talks in Islamabad came within six weeks of the IMF approving the bailout, an unusual move as it is rare for the fund to discuss reforms ahead of a review of the reform plan under the loan programme.A first review of Pakistan's reforms is due in the first quarter of 2025.""We discussed reforms in taxation, energy sector, privatisation of loss-making state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and public finance,"" Aurangzeb said in a recorded video statement broadcast by state-run television.After wrapping up the visit, the IMF had said it was encouraged by Islamabad's reaffirmed commitment to the economic reforms under the Extended Fund Facility its board had approved in September to reduce vulnerabilities.The mission did not state the weaknesses, but sources in Pakistan's finance ministry have said some major lapses prompted the IMF's visit.Among these were a shortfall of nearly 190 billion rupees ($685 million) in revenue collection during the first quarter of the current fiscal year, the sources said.The period also saw an external financing gap of $2.5 billion, while Pakistan failed in the bid to sell its national airline.It had prompted fears that Pakistan might need to impose new taxes to bridge the shortfall.But Aurangzeb said the shortfall will be met only with enforcement to get people to pay their taxes, implying there would not be any new revenue measures.""We are going to be very firm on compliance and enforcement,"" he said, adding that al the sectors will have to play their role in contributing towards the country's economy.The IMF said both sides agreed on the need to continue prudent fiscal and monetary policies, and to mobilise revenue from untapped tax bases.Pakistan's $350 billion economy has struggled for decades with boom-and-bust cycles, needing 23 IMF bailouts since 1958.(Reporting by Asif Shahzad; Editing by Kirsten Donovan and Emelia Sithole-Matarise)",The talks in Islamabad came within six weeks of the IMF approving the bailout. It is rare for the fund to discuss reforms ahead of a review of the reform plan.

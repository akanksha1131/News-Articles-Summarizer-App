ITR filing FY 2024-25: Has deadline for Income Tax Returns filing been extended beyond September 15? Income Tax Department clarifies,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/taxation/itr-filing-2025-has-the-deadline-been-pushed-beyond-september-15-what-income-tax-dept-said/articleshow/123891607.cms,"Representative image





The Income Tax department on Sunday dismissed social media claims suggesting that the deadline for filing Income Tax Returns (ITRs) had been extended beyond September 15, clarifying that the due date remains unchanged.In a post on X, the department said: “A fake news is in circulation stating that the due of filing ITRs (originally due on 31.07.2025, and extended to 15.09.2025) has been further extended to 30.09.2025. The due date for filing ITRs remains 15.09.2025.”The clarification came amid a wave of unverified messages circulating online.The I-T department has urged taxpayers to rely only on updates from its verified handle @IncomeTaxIndia and avoid being misled by false claims. It further noted that its helpdesk is working “on a 24x7 basis” to support taxpayers with ITR filing, tax payment and other related services through calls, live chats, WebEx sessions and X.Over six crore ITRs had already been filed for the Assessment Year 2025-26 as of Saturday.The department thanked taxpayers and professionals for their efforts, while reminding those yet to file to do so before the September 15 deadline to avoid last-minute delays, penalties and interest.The filing window had originally closed on July 31 but was extended to September 15 due to revisions introduced in ITR forms earlier this year.These “structural and content revisions” were rolled out in April–May, requiring changes to filing utilities and back-end systems, which prompted the extension.While this relaxation covered individuals, HUFs and non-audit entities, officials have underlined that a further extension is “unlikely.”Taxpayers missing the deadline can still file a belated return until December 31, 2025, though this attracts late fees under Section 234F of the Income Tax Act — Rs 1,000 for income up to Rs 5 lakh and Rs 5,000 for income above that threshold.Delays also trigger interest liabilities under Sections 234A, 234B and 234C. Moreover, belated filers are shifted to the new tax regime by default and lose the ability to carry forward certain business or capital losses.ITR submissions have been steadily rising in recent years. For AY 2024-25, a record 7.28 crore returns were filed by July 31, 2024, up from 6.77 crore the previous year, marking a 7.5% annual increase.With Monday marking the final day, the department has reiterated its appeal: file early, comply on time, and avoid penalties.",The Income Tax department on Sunday dismissed social media claims suggesting that the deadline for filing Income Tax Returns (ITRs) had been extended beyond September 15.

India’s first private strategic petroleum reserve: Top things to know

The venture includes a crude oil filling expense of $1.25 billion (Rs 11,020 crore) at present rates, representing the most substantial private investment towards strengthening the nation's energy security infrastructure.

The company has been allocated a five-year construction period and a 60-year operational term for a 2.5 million metric tonnes (MMT) strategic petroleum reserve facility in Padur, Karnataka. Padur already hosts portions of India's current strategic reserves.

This new reserve will enhance India's present 5.33-MMT strategic reserves, which currently provide only 8-9 days of crude supply when at capacity, the ET report said.

The bidding process, managed by the state-owned Indian Strategic Petroleum Reserves Ltd (ISPRL), was determined by the viability gap funding (VGF) requirements of participants. The VGF was restricted to 60% of the Rs 5,700-crore project value, amounting to Rs 3,420 crore.

The current strategic petroleum reserve facilities in India, managed by ISPRL, maintain 39 million barrels in underground storage at Visakhapatnam, Mangaluru, and Padur.

This capacity falls significantly short compared to the United States' 727 million barrels and China's estimated 1,200 million barrels.

Readying Buffer





India is looking to build its first-ever private sector strategic petroleum reserve in the next five years. The massive Rs 5,700 crore project contract has been awarded to Megha Engineering & Infrastructures Ltd.According to an ET report quoting sources, Megha Engineering has bagged the significant contract to construct and operate the first private-sector strategic petroleum reserve.Megha emerged as the successful bidder with an offer just under the maximum limit, surpassing two competitors whose identities remain undisclosed, according to informed sources quoted in the report.Sources indicate that ISPRL will shortly finalise the agreement with Megha, providing them a 214-acre plot at no cost for storage development. The agreement is expected to include provisions requiring the company to partially fill the SPR cavern to ensure emergency preparedness objectives are met.According to sources quoted in the report, Megha plans to recover its investment through storage space rentals to the government and oil firms, whilst maintaining autonomy in crude oil trading operations.Whilst storage leasing provides steady revenue, trading activities involve higher risks and require specialist knowledge.The government will maintain priority access to oil reserves during emergencies, ensuring the facility serves both commercial and strategic national interests.The Padur facility includes the construction of specialised infrastructure for oil handling, including both onshore and offshore pipeline networks.Megha's primary business involves EPC contracting for the oil and gas industry, including refinery construction, pipeline installation and rig provision. The company is currently developing an underground LPG storage facility for Hindustan Petroleum.Operating an SPR represents a significant new venture for this Hyderabad-based organisation. The concept of private involvement in India's strategic petroleum reserves was initially proposed more than ten years ago.In 2018, the Union cabinet granted preliminary approval for two PPP model projects: Padur in Karnataka (2.5 MMT) and Chandikhol in Odisha (4 MMT). The development of a suitable framework to attract private investment required several years of planning.","India is looking to build its first-ever private sector strategic petroleum reserve.

"Discoms to save Rs 3,000 crore annually from GST cut on green energy",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/discoms-to-save-rs-3000-crore-annually-from-gst-cut-on-green-energy/articleshow/123954636.cms,"Diwali Gift for Consumers: Govt Slashes GST Across Sectors, Prices to Drop from Sept 22





NEW DELHI: Reduction of GST (goods and services tax) from 12% to 5% across the renewable energy value chain is expected to bring down the power procurement costs of discoms (distribution utilities) across the country by roughly Rs 3,000 crore annually, the government said on Wednesday.The savings may not lead to reduction in consumer tariffs as they do not fully reflect costs due to inadequate upward revisions. Rating agency ICRA on Tuesday said as per the tariff revisions for 2025-26 cleared by 23 out of 28 states till August put the median hike at the all-India level at 1.9% against 2.1% in 2024-25.Still, the lower GST will contribute towards narrowing the gap between discoms’ cost of supply and revenue realisation, which ICRA pegged at 45 paise per unit. While factors such as line losses and billing inefficiencies also contribute to the gap, reduced power purchase costs will bring some relief for discoms, which ICRA said, have a gross debt burden of Rs. 7.4 lakh crore as of March 2024, up from Rs. 6.6 lakh crore a year earlier.Beyond the immediate, the real benefit of lower GST will become more noticeable as levelised tariffs for green power become more competitive as project costs come down.The renewable energy ministry reckons the cost of a grid-level solar project, which typically hovers around Rs 4 crore per MW, will come down by Rs 25 lakh. At the scale of a 500 MW solar park, this translates into project cost reductions of over Rs 100 crore.Lower GST will energise prime minister Narendra Modi’s rooftop solar scheme by bringing costs within reach of more households, especially among those with modest or lower incomes. A typical 3,000-watt rooftop solar system is expected to become cheaper by Rs 9,000–10,500, the ministry said. Farmers will also benefit by way of lower costs for solar pumps covered under the PM KUSUM scheme, as will off-grid projects in rural or remote areas.The biggest benefit will be for the renewable energy manufacturing sector as reduced GST will make them competitive due to a drop of 3-4% in component costs. This is expected to boost rapid expansion in domestic manufacturing, leading to more job creation.",Reduction of GST (goods and services tax) from 12% to 5% across the renewable energy value chain is expected to bring down power procurement costs.

It is widely expected that the central bank may go ahead to slash its interest rates by 25 bps, as a slight possibility of a 50 bp cut also exists. Overall possibility of 3 rate cuts persists by the end of the year. Having said that, a summary of economic projections which includes projections on interest rate cuts to be released by the US Fed during the meeting remains crucial to be assessed for further direction in precious metal prices.Overall, a likely hawkish cut could bring in profit booking moves in prices. However, chances of any major correction lower remains' limited, as the US labour market shows signs of weakening, where major supports lie at around $ 3620 – 3570 zone (CMP $ 3685).

What is the penalty for filing a belated return?



Can I claim a refund in a belated return?



How to file ITR after the due date?





Can a belated return be revised?







The Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) on Monday extended the income tax return (ITR) filing deadline for individual taxpayers by one day, from September 15 to September 16, 2025 for AY 2025-26.The extension applies to those not required to undergo an income tax audit. This deadline has not been extended further.So, what happens if one misses the deadline?Taxpayers missing the deadline can still file a belated return until December 31, 2025, but it may attract penalties and other consequences.Any ITR filed after the due date is considered a belated return and can be submitted until December 31, 2025. While filing a belated ITR allows taxpayers to comply with the law, it comes with certain limitations, including late fees and other potential consequences.Tax experts advise taxpayers to act promptly and file their ITR by September 16 to avoid unnecessary penalties and complications.Chartered Accountant Hitesh Jain, Partner – Direct Tax, N. A. Shah Associates LLP, explained that under Section 115BAC, effective from Assessment Year 2024-25, the new tax regime is the default option.Jain said, “So if a taxpayer wants to opt for the old regime, then ITR needs to be filed before the due date prescribed under Section 139(1) which is September 15, 2025 for FY 2024-25 (AY 2025-26).”This means that taxpayers without business income can select the old tax regime only through the original ITR filed on or before the due date. Jain added that deductions such as house rent allowance (HRA), home loan principal and interest under Section 80C, leave travel allowance (LTA), and others cannot be claimed if the ITR is filed after the deadline. In cases where the total tax liability is lower under the old regime, missing the September 15 deadline could lead to a higher effective tax liability.Taxpayers who miss the September 16 deadline for filing their ITR must pay a late fee of up to Rs 5,000. Those with an annual income exceeding Rs 5 lakh will be liable for a Rs 5,000 fee, while individuals earning below Rs 5 lakh will pay Rs 1,000. No late fee is charged for filing a nil belated return.A belated ITR is treated the same as a return filed on or before the original deadline when it comes to refunds. Taxpayers can claim a refund when filing a belated ITR, provided they complete all necessary bank validation and compliance requirements.One has to file an ITR after the due date (belated ITR) by logging into the ITR filing portal and then select the filing section as 139(4). The rest process is the same as filing an original ITR.Belated ITRs can be revised, but only until December 31, 2025.

US Federal Reserve rate cut: Top points to know

US Fed aims to maintain peak employment levels while targeting a long-term inflation rate of 2 percent. The economic outlook continues to show significant uncertainty, with the Committee noting increased risks to employment opportunities.

When evaluating potential changes to the federal funds rate target range, the Committee shall thoroughly analyse new data, future prospects and risk factors.

It maintains its commitment to decrease holdings of Treasury securities, agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities.

The FOMC remains firmly dedicated to fostering maximum employment whilst bringing inflation back to its 2 percent target.

The Committee shall continue evaluating incoming information's impact on economic prospects whilst determining appropriate monetary policy measures.

Should any risks surface that might hinder achieving the FOMC’s objectives, it is ready to modify monetary policy accordingly.

FOMC’s evaluations shall encompass diverse factors, including labour market conditions, inflation metrics and expectations, alongside financial and global economic developments.





US Fed FOMC Meeting: Led by chairman Jerome Powell, the US Federal Reserve on Wednesday announced a 25 basis points rate cut after the FOMC meeting. ""In support of its goals and in light of the shift in the balance of risks, the Committee decided to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by 1/4 percentage point to 4 to 4-1/4 percent,"" read the FOMC statement.""Recent indicators suggest that growth of economic activity moderated in the first half of the year. Job gains have slowed, and the unemployment rate has edged up but remains low. Inflation has moved up and remains somewhat elevated,"" it added.While all members of FOMC voted in favour of the 25 basis points cut, Stephen I. Miran, the Donald Trump pick, recently appointed as US Fed governor voted for a 50 basis points cut. The FOMC has pencilled in two more rate cuts for this year. It has also raised the GDP growth forecast to 1.6% from its June projection of 1.4% while keeping the outlook for inflation and unemployment unchanged.This is the first rate cut by the US Fed in 2025 even as it navigates through conflicting pressures, including pressure from US President Donald Trump and potential internal disagreements amongst its members. Trump has consistently been slamming Powell-led US Fed for not cutting rates, calling the Fed chairman 'too late'.Stock markets and economists had widely expected the 25 basis points rate cut. Following its previous reduction in December, the Federal Reserve had maintained interest rates within the range of 4.25 percent to 4.50 percent.The Federal Reserve determines the federal funds rate, which governs interbank lending. Although consumers don't directly experience this rate, its fluctuations influence interest charges on various financial products, including credit cards, vehicle financing, home loans and other banking services.When establishing this rate, the Federal Reserve pursues two primary objectives, commonly referred to as the ""dual mandate"": controlling prices of goods and services, whilst promoting maximum employment.Conventionally, the US Federal Reserve raises rates to combat inflation and reduces them to stimulate economic expansion and job creation.At present, the US Fed faces a complex situation where inflation exceeds their 2% objective, yet employment figures remain suboptimal, creating a challenging policy environment.Current data indicates increasing difficulty in job acquisition, potentially compelling the Federal Reserve to prioritise employment concerns over inflationary pressures.The Federal Reserve has maintained steady rates this year, concerned that rate reductions could increase inflation, particularly given their worries about how President Donald Trump's tariffs might affect product prices. Inflation remains persistently above the Federal Reserve's 2% benchmark.","US Fed aims to maintain peak employment levels while targeting a long-term inflation rate of 2 percent.

Middle east conflict: EU calls to impose sanctions and tariffs on Israel; 37% of imports targeted,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/middle-east-conflict-eu-calls-to-impose-sanctions-and-tariffs-on-israel-37-of-imports-targeted/articleshow/123951649.cms,"Split within the EU

How it would work





The European Union on Wednesday unveiled its strongest plan so far to pressurise Israel to end the war in Gaza, which has now dragged on for 23 months.EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas has called on the bloc’s 27 countries to raise tariffs on some Israeli goods and place sanctions on Israeli settlers, as well as two cabinet ministers in PM Benjamin Netanyahu’s government, national security minister Itamar Ben-Gvir and finance minister Bezalel Smotrich.Her proposal also mentions sanctioning ten Hamas leaders.“We are proposing these measures not to punish Israel or Israel people, but to really try to pressure (the) Israeli government to change course and to end the human suffering in Gaza,"" Kallas said at a press conference in Brussels.""The war needs to end, the suffering must stop, and all hostages must be released.”The sanctions would mean freezing any European assets belonging to those targeted and banning them from travelling in the EU.As the EU is Israel’s largest trading partner, the move could have serious economic effects. Israel’s economy has already been shaken by the long war. The commission also said around 32 million euros ($37.5 million) in bilateral funds would be frozen, though financial aid for the Palestinian Authority will continue.Israel has rejected claims of starvation in Gaza and insists it is allowing enough humanitarian aid into the territory.The measures reflect growing friction between Europe and Israel. Just last week, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who has until now been seen as a strong ally of Israel, said Europe needed to put pressure on Israel over its military campaign.However, Israeli foreign minister Gideon Saar accused von der Leyen of siding with terrorists and vowed Israel would not give in.“Pressure through sanctions will not work. The State of Israel is a proud sovereign nation, and we will not be bent through threats while Israel’s security is at stake,” he wrote in a letter to her.The 27 EU countries remain divided on how to deal with Israel, and it is not certain that a majority will support the sanctions and trade measures.The bloodshed in Gaza has triggered large protests across Europe, including in Amsterdam and Barcelona, and raised questions over whether Brussels is doing enough to stop the war and get more aid in.Health officials in Gaza said on Wednesday that more than 65,000 Palestinians have been killed since the war began on 7 October 2023, when Hamas launched its attack on Israel.European Commission trade chief Maros Sefcovic described the plan as “a carefully considered response to an increasingly urgent situation.”If approved, tariffs worth around 230 million euros ($166 million) would be applied to about 37% of Israeli goods imported into the EU, currently worth 15.9 billion euros a year. Those goods now enter tariff-free under an Association Agreement between the two sides.An EU review earlier this year found that Israel had broken the human rights commitments in that agreement, known as Article 2. Critics have been pushing for the entire trade deal to be suspended, but for now the commission is only proposing to remove the zero-tariff benefit for some goods. Those items would instead face standard World Trade Organization tariffs, ranging from 8% to 40%.The proposal follows von der Leyen’s call last week for sanctions and a partial suspension of trade with Israel.EU officials said Israel’s war in Gaza, along with increasing settler violence in the West Bank linked to Ben-Gvir and Smotrich, had created “new momentum” for the move. However, Israeli arms exports to the EU would not be affected.",EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas has called on the bloc’s 27 countries to raise tariffs on some Israeli goods and place sanctions on Israeli settlers.

Soya Soya chand: Bad moon rising over US farm country because of tariffs,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/soya-soya-chand-bad-moon-rising-over-us-farm-country-because-of-tariffs/articleshow/123951375.cms,"A soya farm (Representational AI image)

The TOI correspondent from Washington:





The reason behind American trade overtures towards India amid punitive tariffs, manifested in President Trump’s friendly messages to Prime Minister Modi and sending a key trade negotiator to New Delhi, lies not just in the chambers of commerce in Washington DC, but in the vast farm lands of Iowa, Nebraska, Kansas and other states in Middle America.Scores of reports and interviews with farmers reveal a growing sense of panic over unsold soy beans and corn, the top two US agricultural exports. The disquiet is channeling into anger at the Trump administration, whose decision, prompted by the President, to engage in a tariff war, particularly against China, has resulted in retaliatory measures by Beijing which has ended all agri purchases from US. China buys more than 60 percent of the world’s soya output, half of which comes from US, to feed its voracious pork industry.China is instead buying all its soya from Brazil, fueling Trump’s anger against BRICS while American farmers are fuming at Washington for the looming disaster ahead of the harvest season now underway. Soaring input costs, falling crop prices, the Chinese boycott, and growing uncertainty from trade policies, are causing what Caleb Ragland, a soybean farmer and president of the American Soybean Association, describes as a ""five-alarm fire.The upshot of all this is US farmers are on their knees, begging for intervention from the administration, which is now sending out its negotiators to talk to the Chinese, pleading with them to resume agri purchases, and even seeking New Delhi’s help with corn purchases even though India is self-sufficient in corn. US lawmakers, many of them Republicans from red MAGA leaning states, are worried about their prospects in the 2026 mid-term elections if there is no resolution to the tariff spat.These are some of the headlines one is seeing in the media reporting out of Middle America: Trump’s Tariffs DEVASTATE U.S. Farmers - Billions Lost in U.S. Agriculture ""US Soybean Growers Beg Trump for China Trade Deal,” and ""After Losing China Market, US Soybean President Realizes America Needs China to Be Great Again!Since most of Middle America is conservative Trump territory and predominantly support the President, Democrats and liberals are also having a field day trolling farmers via video posts with headlines such as ""MAGA Soybean Farmers Begging America for Socialism After Mocking Welfare for Years. Many are mocking MAGA “mugs” from not learning from Trump’s first term, when he picked a similar tariff fight with China and had to eventually bail out farmers to the tune of $ 20 billion.By one account, 216 farms filed for bankruptcy this year, a 55% increase from the previous year. And these are not small farms. Unlike in India, where the average agricultural holding is less than two acres, the average American farm is closer to 500 acres with some going up to 10,000 acres and more, and they are a big source of funding and political support to the GOP. Some of them are now having misgivings are what they see as Trump blunders, including tariffing steel and aluminum that have increased their input costs, while a few Democrat-leaning farmers are gloating with “I told you so” messages.Sarah Taber, a North Carolina farmer and crop scientist who ran for office as a Democrat in 2024, and who runs a popular farm blog, says the turn of events was entirely predictable."" I'm always surprised when people say we were ""lied to"" about what Trump would do to us. We weren't! US farmers knew Trump planned another trade war, and that it would hurt our businesses. And a lot of farmers just voted for him anyway,” she said in her podcast Farm to Taber.While American corn and soybean farmers are under stress, New Delhi is providing some relief to farmers growing tree nuts, having lifted tariffs on almonds and pistachios even as other major buyers like China and Turkey keep them on. India is now the largest buyer of “badam-pista” accounting for 70 percent and 90 percent of US exports of these two agricultural products.But that’s not enough to make MAGA folks happy. Reason: 90 percent of US treenuts are grown in California, a Democrat stronghold.","US farmers are on their knees, begging for intervention from the administration.

Amazon US salary hikes: E-commerce giant rolls out $1 billion plan for workforce; check details,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/amazon-us-salary-hikes-e-commerce-giant-rolls-out-1-billion-plan-for-workforce-check-details/articleshow/123950590.cms,"



E-commerce giant Amazon on Wednesday announced a $1 billion plan to boost wages and cut health care costs for its fulfillment and transportation workers in the United States.The Seattle-based company increased the average hourly pay to over $23. Staff with longer service will see their wages go up by between $1.10 and $1.90 an hour.For full-time employees, the change means an extra $1,600 a year on average.Starting next year, Amazon will also reduce the cost of its basic health plan. Weekly contributions will fall to $5, while co-pays will also be set at $5. According to the company, this will cut weekly costs by 34% and bring down co-pays for primary care, mental health and most non-specialist visits by 87%.Amazon employs around 1.5 million people globally.The announcement follows a period of disputes over working conditions. Last December, employees at seven Amazon sites went on strike, with the Teamsters union pushing for a labour deal during the busy holiday shopping season. In the same month, the company settled with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, agreeing to introduce ergonomic measures nationwide after the agency linked unsafe practices to back and musculoskeletal injuries among staff.Other major retailers have also been raising wages. In January 2024, Walmart, the largest private employer in the US, said average hourly pay would rise above $18, up from $17.50. The company credited the increase to the addition of higher-paid roles in its Auto Care Centres.A year earlier, in January 2023, Walmart raised starting pay for US staff to between $14 and $19 an hour, compared with the previous range of $12 to $18, depending on the store location.","The Seattle-based company increased the average hourly pay to over $23.

Canada rate cut: Central bank trims lending rate to 2.5%; economy struggles under Trump’s tariff war,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/canada-rate-cut-central-bank-trims-lending-rate-to-2-5-economy-struggles-under-trumps-tariff-war/articleshow/123948754.cms,"



Canada’s central bank on Wednesday lowered its key lending rate to 2.5%, giving some relief to borrowers as the country’s economy feels the strain of US President Donald Trump’s trade war.The Bank of Canada had kept its rate steady at 2.75% since March, while assessing the impact of Trump’s shifting tariffs on Canadian businesses that rely heavily on exports to the United States.But the bank said there is now clear evidence that US protectionism is slowing the global economy.“After remaining resilient to sharply higher US tariffs and ongoing uncertainty, global economic growth is showing signs of slowing,” it said in a statement.Canada’s GDP shrank by 1.5% in the second quarter of 2025, with tariffs and trade tensions “weighing heavily on economic activity,” according to the bank.In the first quarter, exporters had benefited from a rush of US orders, as companies stocked up before tariffs took full effect. But Canadian exports dropped 27% in the second quarter as those advance orders faded.Trump has so far kept tariff exemptions for goods covered under the existing North American free trade agreement, which has softened the blow to some extent.Even so, steep tariffs on cars, steel and aluminium are causing significant damage.“Job losses have largely been concentrated in trade-sensitive sectors, while employment growth in the rest of the economy has slowed, reflecting weak hiring intentions,” the bank said.Canada was the first G7 country to start cutting interest rates last year, after raising them earlier to rein in inflation driven by the pandemic.Wednesday’s cut was widely expected, but the bank warned it would move carefully, as US protectionism could still push up prices for Canadian consumers.It said it would closely watch how “reconfigured supply chains are passed on to consumer prices and how inflation expectations evolve.”",Canada’s central bank on Wednesday lowered its key lending rate to 2.5%.

US markets saw a mixed performance on Wednesday after the Federal Reserve delivered its first interest rate cut of the year and hinted that more reductions are expected in the coming months.The S&P 500 edged down 0.17% or 11 points, reaching 6,595. Nasdaq Composite also slipped 79 points or 0.36%, reaching 22,254, because of handful major big tech stocks falling.The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 178 points, or 0.39%, tradding at 45,936 at 12:43 AM IST.The market reacted after the Fed reduced its main interest rate for the first time this year, a move Wall Street had largely anticipated. Even more significant, however, were the projections released by Fed officials, suggesting additional rate cuts are likely both this year and next.They signalled that the typical member expects the federal funds rate to fall to between 3.25% and 3.50% by the end of next year, down from the current 4% to 4.25% range.Investors have already pushed stock prices to record highs on the expectation of easier borrowing costs, with some critics warning that shares may now be overvalued. Had the Fed suggested fewer cuts were likely, markets could have reacted sharply, weighing down prices sharply, according to AP.Lower interest rates can give the economy a much-needed boost, and recent signs suggest the jobs market could use that support. Hiring has been slow enough that employment may now pose a bigger challenge for the economy than rising inflation.The Fed, which adjusts interest rates to manage both inflation and employment, had kept rates steady earlier this year over concerns that US President Donald Trump’s tariffs could push up prices across many products. Inflation has so far remained above the Fed’s 2% target.After the Fed’s projections, shares in companies likely to benefit most from cheaper borrowing led the gains. Smaller firms, which often rely on loans to grow and compete with larger rivals, helped lift the Russell 2000 index by 1%, outpacing the broader market.Lyft surged 11.9% after announcing it will launch an autonomous ride-hailing service in Nashville in partnership with Waymo.Workday climbed 6.9% following news that Elliott Investment Management had built a stake worth more than $2 billion and voiced support for the company’s management. The business software provider, which helps clients manage finances and human resources, also expanded its share buyback programme by up to $4 billion to return cash to investors, AP reported.However, losses among a few major technology stocks held back broader indexes. Nvidia fell 3.2% and Broadcom dropped 4.7%. Both had previously helped drive Wall Street to record highs, fuelled by excitement over artificial intelligence, regardless of interest rate movements.Meanwhile, in Europe and Asia, indexes traded mixed.","The S&P 500 edged down 0.17% or 11 points, reaching 6,595.

Nestle shares dipped on Wednesday after the food and beverage giant announced the “earlier than planned” exit of its chairman, Paul Bulcke, marking another shake-up at the top of the Swiss multinational.The news sent Nestle’s stock down 0.51% to 71.52 Swiss francs ($90.80) in early trading, weighing on the Swiss stock exchange’s SMI index, which slipped 0.31%.The group, whose brands include Nespresso coffee and KitKat chocolate, announced on Tuesday night that Bulcke would step down on October 1, months ahead of his planned departure in April 2026. Vice-chairman Pablo Isla will be taking over the position.Bulcke’s sudden departure comes just two weeks after chief executive Laurent Freixe was dismissed over an “undisclosed romantic relationship with a direct subordinate”, a scandal that forced his immediate removal after only a year in the role. He has since been replaced by Philipp Navratil, the former head of Nespresso, AFP reported.For many investors, Bulcke’s departure had already been overdue. The Belgian executive spent nearly ten years as chief executive before becoming chairman in 2017, but shareholders have increasingly held him responsible for the instability that culminated in Freixe’s removal. The Financial Times reported that investors directly linked him to the company’s chaotic recent period.“Pressure from investors had mounted to a peak in recent weeks following the turmoil involving former CEO Laurent Freixe,” Vontobel analyst Jean-Philippe Bertschy wrote, as cited by AFP.“Nestle needs to return to calmer waters and regain its former stature.”Patrik Schwendimann, analyst at Zurich Cantonal Bank, said the timing was hardly surprising. “The early resignation comes as little surprise after the events of the past few weeks,” he noted, adding that Bulcke’s departure would allow“Nestle to focus on the future, hopefully with less background noise”.","Nestle chairman Paul Bulcke will step down on October 1, months ahead of his planned departure in April 2026.

Asset managers ramp up allocations

Challenges persist despite optimism





After years of scepticism and branding Chinese stock markets as “uninvestable"", foreign investors are once again turning their attention to Chinese equities, betting on the country’s resilience in artificial intelligence, semiconductors and biotech as well as a growing need for diversification beyond US assets.Progress in China’s AI adoption, its push in semiconductors, and breakthroughs in biotech this year have reassured investors that the Sino-US trade war and Washington’s export restrictions have not derailed innovation in the world’s second-largest economy, Reuters reported.Adding to the momentum, a US-China tariff truce and supportive domestic monetary policy have improved sentiment, helping the Shanghai Composite index touch a decade high last week, while Hong Kong’s benchmark hit a four-year peak.Foreign early movers have already started returning, lured by the 2025 bull run and seeking diversification away from crowded US assets. “China is interesting because it's very uncorrelated to the rest of the world, at least the onshore A-share market,” Brett Barna told Reuters, a former hedge fund manager who now runs two New York-based single-family offices. He added that he plans to set up an investment platform allowing US and European capital to access Chinese markets.Data backs the shift. Morgan Stanley said August saw the largest monthly buying of China stocks by global hedge funds in six months. Meanwhile, Morningstar noted that new “emerging market ex-China” fund launches fell sharply to eight in 2025, compared to 21 in 2024 and 16 in 2023—reflecting cooling demand for EM products excluding China.“A year ago, people wanted to exclude China from indices. Now, China is seen as a standalone asset class (they cannot ignore),” said Zheng Yucheng, chief investment officer of the China unit of Allianz Global Investors.London-based Polar Capital, which manages $20 billion, pivoted to a positive stance on China in late 2024, raising its allocation to over 30% from the low 20% range within its EM portfolio. “There is a revaluation of Chinese innovative assets,” said fund manager Jerry Wu, citing AI firm DeepSeek’s cost-efficient model rivaling ChatGPT.Wu added that interest has surged across AI, biotech, and robotics. Polar’s annual conference in February drew 55 clients for the China session—more than double 2023’s attendance.Benjamin Low, senior investment director at Cambridge Associates, said his team has handled about 30 client inquiries for China funds this year, a stark contrast to 2023’s near absence of interest. Many allocators from outside Asia are now planning trips to China and Hong Kong, some for the first time since COVID-19, to explore opportunities.Despite the turnaround in sentiment, structural concerns remain. China’s economy continues to show weakness, with August factory output and retail sales data underscoring sluggish demand. Foreign direct investment fell 13.2% in the first five months of 2025, prompting Beijing to unveil new measures in July to stem the decline.CLSA chief equity strategist Alexander Redman cautioned that deflationary pressures are preventing him from overweighting the market. Wu of Polar Capital also warned that AI’s momentum must translate into wider economic benefits for the rally to last beyond 2025.Foreign investors, analysts said, are now in a “rerating” phase, reassessing China’s long-term competitiveness. “Foreign capital is standing at the door and watching. They haven’t stepped in yet — but are at least thinking about coming back,” said Cheng Yu, portfolio manager at Allianz China.The Chinese stock market, including Hong Kong, is valued at nearly $19 trillion. August’s surge in foreign interest suggests early signs of a broader revival, though the durability of inflows will depend on how Beijing balances innovation with broader economic stability.","Foreign investors are once again turning their attention to Chinese equities.

"US Fed meeting begins: Trump aide Stephen Miran sworn in as governor, Jerome Powell under pressure as rate cut expected",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-fed-meeting-begins-trump-aide-stephen-miran-sworn-in-as-governor-jerome-powell-under-pressure-as-rate-cut-expected/articleshow/123925918.cms,"



The US Federal Reserve opened a key interest rate meeting on Tuesday, just hours after Donald Trump’s close aide Stephen Miran was sworn in as a governor of the central bank, while another top official, Lisa Cook, is fighting the president’s attempt to oust her.Miran, who has been a senior adviser to Trump, took the oath of office on Tuesday, the Fed said in a statement, as its rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) began a two-day policy gathering AFP reported. His arrival followed a narrow Senate vote on Monday night confirming him as one of the FOMC’s 12 voting members.Markets widely expect the Fed to announce its first interest rate cut of 2025 when the meeting concludes on Wednesday, as policymakers seek to shore up a weakening jobs market. But political pressure on the independent central bank has intensified, with Trump repeatedly urging Chair Jerome Powell to cut rates more aggressively.Miran’s appointment gives him a single vote on the FOMC, and it is unclear whether he will align with Trump’s calls for steeper reductions. On Tuesday, Trump told reporters that the Fed should “listen to smart people like me.”Before joining the Fed, Miran was serving as chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers.His decision to take a leave of absence from that role, rather than resign, drew criticism from Democratic lawmakers, particularly as his Fed term lasts just over four months. He is filling the unexpired term of Adriana Kugler, who stepped down before her stint was due to end in late January.The meeting is also overshadowed by Trump’s attempt to remove Cook, a Fed governor appointed by former president Joe Biden, over allegations of mortgage fraud. Cook has not been charged, and the alleged incidents predate her appointment. A federal appeals court ruled late Monday that she could remain in place while her legal challenge proceeds, but the Trump administration plans to take the case to the Supreme Court.White House spokesman Kush Desai told AFP that the president “lawfully removed Lisa Cook for cause,” which he said could mean malfeasance or dereliction of duty. He added: “The administration will appeal this decision and looks forward to ultimate victory on the issue.”The Fed has held its benchmark lending rate between 4.25 percent and 4.50 percent since December, monitoring the impact of Trump’s tariffs on the economy. Markets are betting on a 25-basis point cut this week, while looking for signals on the pace and scale of reductions in the months ahead.","Stephen Miran, a senior adviser to Donald Trump, was sworn in as a governor of the central bank on Tuesday.

Green steel ambition





Jindal Steel International has made a non-binding offer to acquire Thyssenkrupp’s steel division, the German conglomerate said Tuesday, in a move that could reshape Europe’s traditional steel landscape. The bid, details of which were not disclosed, sent Thyssenkrupp shares soaring nearly 8% in Frankfurt trade, AFP reported.The once-iconic German industrial major has been trying to exit its struggling steel arm — Thyssenkrupp Steel Europe (TKSE) — which has been battling high domestic costs and Asian competition. The group said it would “carefully review” the proposal from Jindal and pay “particular attention” to the implications for jobs.Juergen Kerner, a workers’ representative on Thyssenkrupp’s board, described the offer from the “growth-oriented” Indian steelmaker as positive for employees. “Jindal Steel has its own access to raw materials and expertise in the green transformation,” he said, urging a quick dialogue to resolve workforce concerns.TKSE, which announced plans last year to cut 11,000 jobs by 2030 — about 40% of its workforce — has been under pressure to find a long-term buyer or partner.The Indian offer could trigger a contest with Czech billionaire Daniel Kretinsky, who acquired a stake in the steel unit through his holding firm EPCG and had been in talks for a potential joint venture.Jindal, in its statement, said it was committed to green steel production, aligning with Thyssenkrupp’s shift towards low-emission operations. Narendra Misra, head of European operations at Jindal, said the aim was to “preserve and advance the 200-year-old heritage of Thyssenkrupp” while turning it into “the largest low-emission steel producer in Europe.”The German company has been building a new site in Duisburg to produce carbon-neutral steel, though CEO Miguel Lopez has warned of profitability challenges. Jindal pointed to its Oman project, due to start in 2027, as evidence of its commitment to large-scale green steel ventures.A spokesperson for EPCG declined to comment on the Indian bid, AFP reported. Thyssenkrupp has previously indicated talks with Kretinsky about a 50:50 joint venture were still ongoing.Offloading the steel business forms part of Thyssenkrupp’s wider plan to split itself into standalone businesses to improve profitability.","Jindal Steel International has made a non-binding offer to acquire Thyssenkrupp’s steel division.

US stocks hovered near record levels on Tuesday as investors counted down to the Federal Reserve’s policy decision, widely expected to deliver the first rate cut of 2025.The S&P 500 slipped 0.2% after its latest all-time high, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 169 points, or 0.4%. The Nasdaq Composite was down 0.1% by mid-morning trade in New York, AP reported.Stocks have rallied this year on expectations that the Fed will begin a series of rate cuts to shore up a slowing jobs market, which many traders now see as a bigger threat to the economy than inflation pressures stoked by President Donald Trump’s tariffs.The Fed has so far held off on easing policy because inflation remains above its 2% target. Markets are betting on a 25-basis point cut on Wednesday, with Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s press conference and the central bank’s updated forecasts expected to draw heavy scrutiny.Tuesday’s data showed US retail sales rose more than expected in August, though analysts said part of the increase reflected higher prices. While the report suggested household spending remains resilient, it did not shift expectations for imminent rate cuts extending into 2026.Global fund managers are tilting their allocations toward equities at the highest level in seven months, a Bank of America survey showed, even as a record 58% of respondents said stocks look overvalued.Corporate movers added to Wall Street’s mixed tone. Dave & Buster’s tumbled 16.1% after posting weaker quarterly profits, while Ralph Lauren slipped 1.3% after unveiling its “Next Great Chapter: Drive” strategy, forecasting mid-single digit annual revenue growth over three years.The New York Times Co. dropped 2.8% after Trump filed a $15 billion defamation lawsuit against the paper and four journalists, citing coverage ahead of the 2024 election.On the upside, Steel Dynamics jumped 5.9% on stronger earnings across its steel units, Oracle rose 1.2% on speculation it could be involved in a TikTok deal, and Chipotle gained 1.2% after authorising a fresh $500 million share buyback.Overseas, Japan’s Nikkei 225 added 0.3% to close at a record despite political uncertainty after Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba announced plans to step down, with a ruling party leadership vote scheduled for October 4. European markets, however, slipped after a mixed Asian session.In bonds, the 10-year Treasury yield edged down to 4.03% from 4.05% late Monday.","The S&P 500 slipped 0.2% after its latest all-time high, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 169 points, or 0.4%.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume.

Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain and boost vendor partnerships ahead of a stock market debut planned for 2025.The Series E round was done via a combination of fresh equity and conversion of debt, the Bangalore-based company said in a statement Thursday. The round was led by M&G Plc and existing investors including Lightspeed Venture Partners and DST Global participated.The round “fully funds our business plan,” Vaibhav Gupta, Udaan co-founder and chief executive officer, said in the statement. “It enables our continued journey of growth and profitability, positioning us well to be public-market ready in the next 12-18 months.”Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, runs an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business, though a very small part of India’s overall retail market, is expected to swell to $150 billion in sales in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co.The startup targets an initial public offering in 2025, though it’s yet to decide whether it will do so in India or overseas, Gupta told Bloomberg News last month.Udaan was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran the company until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021.

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Startups will play an important role in helping India become the third largest economy in the world, Chief Economic Advisor ( CEA ) to the Union government V Anantha Nageswaran has said.Nageswaran said that tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country due to improvements in infrastructure and supportive policies of the government, according to a KSUM release.The CEA, during his Leadership Talk on the concluding day of the Huddle Global 2023 organised by the Kerala Startup Mission (KSUM), said that India was the fifth largest economy on course to become the third largest in a few years.""In fact, I will say 7-in-7 is the buzz slogan, that is 7 trillion USD economy in seven years. Seven trillion USD economy size by 2030 is possible if India maintains its present growth trajectory, and in that journey startup entrepreneurs are going to play an important role,"" he is quoted as having said in the release.He was of the view that the active participation of startups in India in developing business models on the foundation of expanding physical and digital infrastructure will continue to generate efficiency, revenue and economic returns for the country.""The last decade has seen an exceptional transformation in the startup landscape in India, which has emerged as the third largest ecosystem globally, with over 1.12 lakh startups presently recognised by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) across 763 districts.""Among them, more than 110 are unicorns with a total valuation of around USD 350 billion,"" he said.The CEA further said that the country ranks second in innovation quality.He said that innovation in India was not just limited to certain sectors as startups were solving problems in 56 industrial sectors, with 13 per cent of them from IT services, nine per cent from health and life sciences, seven per cent from education, five per cent from agriculture and five per cent from food and beverages.Nageswaran also said it was significant that 49 per cent of the startups were from tier-2 and 3 cities which have turned to be game-changers as the business advantages in these locations enable entrepreneurs to operate at lower costs as compared to tier-1 cities.""Apart from improved infrastructure and the government's pro-active policies, the availability of a technically skilled talent pool is a huge advantage for startups to set up and flourish in tier-2 and tier-3 cities,"" he said.He said that historically there was a perception that small towns were difficult places to conduct business.""...but with improved internet penetration, vastly better physical infrastructure, road, rail and air connectivity and supportive government policies, this is no longer true,"" he said.He also noted Kerala's startup journey has been an inspiring one.The CEA said that KSUM has served as the catalyst since its establishment in 2006 to promote change that propelled the state into the forefront of the global startup arena.KSUM is the Kerala government's nodal agency established in 2006 for entrepreneurship development and incubation activities in the state.Nageswaran said that with over 4,000 registered tech startups, 63 incubators and 10 lakh square feet of incubation space, KSUM has not only met its goal of promoting technology-based entrepreneurship but has also earned the distinguished position of being among the world's top business incubators.The November 16-18 fifth edition of Huddle Global, India's biggest beachside startup conclave, was organised by KSUM at Adimalathura beach, near Vizhinjam, here.Attended by around 1,500 delegates, the event displayed sophisticated products from emerging sectors such as robotics, Artificial Intelligence , Machine Learning, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, life sciences, space tech, blockchain, IoT, e-governance, fintech, healthtech, agritech, edutech and SaaS from across the country.","Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran said tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country.

E-Commerce startup Udaan to trim costs ahead of 2025 IPO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/e-commerce-startup-udaan-to-trim-costs-ahead-of-2025-ipo/articleshow/105001132.cms,"E-commerce startup Udaan is working to curb costs and forge new partnerships with consumer brands in India as it prepares to go public in 2025.Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta said in an interview. That’s set to happen around the same time as its initial public offering, he said.The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said. “Second, strategically we want to ensure that we are top of mind with shopkeepers, with big manufacturers, and we maintain our relative market share.”Lightspeed Venture Partners-backed Udaan is among startups trying to tap the rapid growth of India’s economy and consumer market, while meeting investor demands for profitability. Udaan, which at its peak employed thousands, joined fellow Indian startups in slashing jobs last year and tightening internal controls and compliance. It now has about 1,800 staff, and Gupta didn’t specify if further job cuts are needed.Corporate governance lapses at Indian online tutoring firm Byju’s, once the country’s top startup with a valuation of $22 billion, shone a light at unique challenges faced by founders in the South Asian nation and drove companies to be more diligent.“We continue to move towards more professionalized management, professionalized board and also institutionalized shareholders as we go towards public markets,” Gupta said.Udaan is yet to decide whether it will list in India or overseas. It was valued at more than $3 billion in a 2021 funding round, and was in talks to raise $400 million, Business Standard reported in September. Lightspeed owns about 35% of Udaan, while Tencent Holdings Ltd. holds 6%.The company was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran Udaan until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021. The other two founders — Amod Malviya and Sujeet Kumar — are board members.Udaan built an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business still accounts for a very small part of India’s overall retail market but can balloon to $150 billion in sales and yield a 100% return on capital invested in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co. estimates published in the Mint newspaper.Bengaluru-based Udaan has also ventured into financing through its fintech unit which helps shopkeepers get working capital loans to buy inventory. That business is profitable before taxes and is growing 70% annually, Gupta said.“That’s a second business in the overall umbrella of Udaan trying to organize trade in the country,” Gupta said. “In addition to commerce, financing becomes an important market opportunity.”","Udaan will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta says.

How India's GDP has been growing

What SBI report said on savings and investment

Incremental capital output ratio

NEW DELHI: India's gross domestic product (GDP) data for the third quarter (October-December 2022) received a word of caution from the former Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Raghuram Rajan In an interview with news agency PTI, Rajan that India is ""dangerously close"" to the Hindu rate of growth in view of subdued private sector investment, high interest rates and slowing global growth.India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%.Rajan termed this sequential slowdown in growth as ""worrying"".However, a report released by the State Bank of India (SBI) economists on Tuesday dismissed arguments that India is dangerously close to Hindu rate of growth saying such statements are ""ill-conceived, biased and premature"".The term 'Hindu growth rate' was coined by late economist Raj Krishna in 1978 to describe the slow growth in the country.It basically refers to the low pace of economic growth rates during 1950s to 1980s. During this period, the Indian economy averaged 3.5%.A former lecturer at the Delhi School of Economics (DSE), Krishna noted that only if the rate of growth is persistently slow and accompanied by low per-capita GDP, then it will be known as Hindu rate of growth but it has to factor in population growth as well.Before economic reforms of 1991, India's economic growth remained stagnant and low, while per capita income averaged around 1.3%. Krishna termed this low growth situation to be a result of socialist policies of state control and import substitution.However, the economic situation changed when liberalisation, privatisation and globalisation (LPG) reforms came into effect in the year 1991, at a time when India faced balance of payment crisis.Over the years, many economists have strongly opposed the idea of 'Hindu growth rate' and the term never had universal acceptance.The Indian economy plunged into its very first technical recession in FY21 due to the impact of Covid-19 pandemic and the related nationwide lockdowns. GDP shrunk by an unprecedented 23.8% in the first quarter of the financial year 2020-21. However, due to spurt in economic activities in the subsequent quarters, the GDP decline started to narrow.However, if we look at the period before Covid-19 as well, India's growth curve shows a declining trend.From 8.26% in FY17, GDP growth plunged to 3.74% in FY20. Shutdown of economic activities in FY21 in wake of Covid-19 only made matters worse.As lockdowns started to ease and business activities resumed, India's GDP also started rising. In Q1 of FY22, growth jumped to 20.1% mainly on account of low base effect. By the fourth quarter of FY22, growth came down to 4.10%.Similarly, the new financial year 2022-23 brought fresh economic challenges in the form of Russia-Ukraine war that impacted almost all major economies of the world, slowed the pace of growth, pushed inflation to record highs.As a result, the central banks of all advanced economies spurred into action and opted for monetary policy tightening to curb the soaring inflation.With persistently rising interest rates, India's economy grew by 4.4% in Q3 of FY23, as the Centre revised upwards GDP growth for previous year to 9.10% from 8.7% earlier.The report weighed recent GDP numbers against the available data on savings and investments for the past decade and highlighted some interesting points.""Quarterly growth numbers are noisy and should be best avoided for any serious interpretation (on an average, India's GDP growth has witnessed Rs 2 lakh crore upward revision for the 3 year ended FY23),"" the report said.Gross capital formation (GCF) by the government touched a high of 11.8% in 2021-22, up from 10.7% in 2020-21.""This also had a domino effect on private sector investment that jumped from 10 per cent to 10.8% over the same period,"" it said.In fact, Ecowrap added that the trends in GCF to gross output ratio or the plough back of funds for creation of fresh capacity shows that for public administration the ratio attained fresh peak in 2021-22 owing to the emphasis on capital expenditure in recent budgets.At the aggregate level, gross capital formation is supposed to have crossed 32% in 2022-23, the highest level since 2018-19.According to the report, in 2021-22, gross savings have risen to 30% from 29% in 2020-21.""The ratio is supposed to have crossed 31 per cent in 2022-23, the highest since 2018-19. The household savings increased sharply during the pandemic period on account of sharp accretion in financial savings such as deposits,"" said the report by SBI's Economic Research Department.While household financial savings have since then moderated from 15.4% in 2020-21 to 11.1% in 2022-23, savings in physical assets have grown sharply to 11.8% in 2021-22 from 10.7% in 2020-21.The report further analysed Incremental Capital Output ratio (ICOR) -- which measures additional units of capital (investment) needed to produce additional units of output. It said that the ratio has been improving.""ICOR which was 7.5 in FY 12 is now only 3.5 in FY22. Clearly, only half of capital is now needed for next unit of output,"" the report noted.Such reducing ICOR in the current years reflects a relatively increasing efficiency of capital and shows that the economy is on a sound footing, the report said.""From that point of view, future GDP growth rates even at 7% could still mean a decent number by any standards!,"" it added.","India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%.

An employee is entitled for a 50 per cent amount of the last drawn salary as pension.OPS was discontinued by the NDA government in 2003 with effect from April 1, 2004.Under the new pension scheme (NPS), employees contribute 10 per cent of their basic salary towards pension while the government contributes 14 per cent.Governments of Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand have informed the central government/ Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA about their decision to restart OPS for their employees.The government of Punjab on November 18, 2022, issued a notification regarding implementation of OPS for the state government employees who are being covered under NPS.

The meeting was chaired by Food Secretary Sanjeev Chopra.Out of the total wheat procurement target for the 2022-23 marketing year (April-March), Punjab will aim to procure 2.5 million tonnes wheat, Haryana 1.5 million tonnes and Madhya Pradrsh 2 million tonnes, the food ministry said in a statement.Wheat procurement had declined last year due to a fall in domestic production and higher exports.However, the government has projected a record wheat production at 112.18 million tonnes in the 2023-24 crop year (July-June) as per the second estimate of the agriculture ministry.Besides wheat, the government has also fixed rabi (winter) rice procurement target at 10.6 million tonnes in the 2022-23 marketing year.States have been advised to enhance rice milling capacity so that milling of one season gets completed before the commencement of next season and recycling of rice may be avoided.Whereas procurement of millets and coarse grains is estimated to be 7,50,000 tonnes this year, higher than 6,30,000 tonnes in 2021-22. Karnataka will procure 6,00,000 tonnes of millets this year, the statement added.Separately addressing the conference, food minister Piyush Goyal urged all state governments to implement smart-PDS at the earliest.He lauded Andhra Pradesh government's Command Control and stated that the central government will work together for implementing it in other states also.On the storage front, the Union minister said FCI is upgrading godowns into five-star rated ones and state governments can also upgrade their godowns.In the conference, all the state governments were told to learn from the best practice of using millets in schemes like mid-day meal and PDS in Karnataka, which is helpful in adding nutrition and promoting healthy diet.States were encouraged to procure more millets and coarse grains. All the state governments were asked to open procurement centres for coarse grains in producing districts, especially, in tribal areas.

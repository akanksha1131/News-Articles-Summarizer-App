Stock market today: Nifty50 and BSE Sensex , the Indian equity benchmark indices, ended Thursday in green, rallying strongly on the back of sweeping GST rate cuts announced by FM Nirmala Sitharaman.During the day, Nifty50 was above 24,850 while BSE Sensex rallied over 500 points.Nifty50 rose to 24,734.30, up 19.25 points or 0.08%. BSE Sensex gained 150.30 points or 0.19%, to end at 80,718.01.Market analysts anticipate sideways movement, influenced by international market trends and industry-specific developments, with GST Council policy decisions acting as the immediate market driver.Dr. VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Investments Limited says, “The revolutionary GST reform has come better than expected benefitting a wide spectrum of sectors. The ultimate beneficiary is the Indian consumer who will benefit from lower prices. The potential big boost to consumption in an economy that is already in growth momentum will be big and may surprise on the upside. This GST reform along with the fiscal and monetary stimulus already provided can trigger a virtuous cycle and boost India’s growth to 6.5% in FY 26 and perhaps 7% in FY 27 with impressive gains in corporate earnings.“The market will start discounting this likely emerging scenario. Stocks in sectors as varied as automobiles, FMCG, white goods, cement, insurance etc will be the focus of attention of the bulls. Autos are likely to outperform. There is a high probability of short covering today pushing prices higher than expectations. However, after the initial enthusiasm, tariff issues will continue to haunt the market.""Nasdaq gained 1% while S&P 500 finished higher on Wednesday, with Alphabet advancing after a US court ruled against its breakup.

Apart from these regular closures, a number of regional festivals and events will also be observed as holidays, according to RBI calendar.While physical branches will be closed on these days, customers can continue to use digital banking platforms including UPI, IMPS, NEFT, RTGS and ATMs without interruption.In September, major festivals such as Karma Puja, Onam, Id-e-Milad, Indrajatra, Navratra Sthapna and Durga Puja will impact bank operations in different states.However, since holidays differ across states, not every bank branch will be closed on the same day. For example, festivals such as Onam or Durga Puja are observed in certain regions and may not affect operations in others. This makes it important for customers to be aware of local holiday schedules to avoid last-minute disruptions in banking plans.These holidays vary from state to state and not all bank branches will remain shut on all the dates. Customers are advised to check with their local branch for clarity before planning visits.","All banks across India — both scheduled and non-scheduled — remain closed on the second and fourth Saturdays and all Sundays in general.

Gold and silver price prediction today: Gold prices are exhibiting a bullish trend and silver is also continuing the positive bias, says Abhilash Koikkara, Head - Forex & Commodities, Nuvama Professional Clients Group. He shares his views on gold and silver:MCX Gold has been showing a consistent upward trend, reflecting strong bullish momentum in recent sessions. With growing investor interest amid global uncertainties and a supportive macroeconomic environment, gold prices are now eyeing the crucial resistance level near ₹107,800 in the coming week. If this level is breached with volume support, it could pave the way for further upside potential in the near term.On the downside, the metal is finding strong support around the ₹105,600 level, which has held well during recent minor pullbacks. This level serves as a key base for the ongoing rally and is likely to act as a cushion against any short-term profit-booking or consolidation. Technically, momentum indicators like RSI and MACD are suggesting continued strength, supporting the bullish sentiment.Fundamentally, global cues such as concerns over inflation, central bank policies, and geopolitical tensions are adding to gold's appeal as a safe-haven asset.Any fresh triggers from the US Federal Reserve or changes in the dollar index could further influence prices.Traders and investors are advised to watch for a decisive break above ₹107,800 for confirmation of further upside, while keeping a close eye on ₹105,600 as a critical support zone. Risk management remains key in volatile market conditions.MCX Silver continues to trade with a positive bias, supported by strong buying interest and favorable global cues. The white metal is showing signs of strength and may soon test the key resistance level of ₹130,000 in the coming sessions. This level is expected to act as a short-term target if the bullish momentum sustains, especially amid increasing industrial demand and safe-haven buying.On the downside, silver is finding firm support near the ₹123,000 level, which has held steady during recent corrections. This support zone is crucial for maintaining the current uptrend and may attract fresh buying if prices dip towards it. Technically, silver is trading above key moving averages, and momentum indicators such as RSI are pointing toward sustained bullish sentiment.Fundamentally, silver is benefiting from a combination of industrial use — especially in electronics and renewable energy — and its status as a hedge against inflation and economic uncertainty. Additionally, movements in the US dollar and yields are likely to influence silver’s direction in the short term.Traders should monitor price action closely near ₹130,000 for potential breakout opportunities, while keeping ₹123,000 as a stop-loss or re-entry level for long positions. Overall sentiment remains positive, with a potential for further gains.","Gold prices are exhibiting a bullish trend and silver is also continuing the positive bias, says Abhilash Koikkara, Head - Forex & Commodities, Nuvama Professional Clients Group.

"Auto industry GST slabs: First-time buyers, middle-income families to gain; sector seeks clarity on cess",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/auto-industry-gst-slabs-first-time-buyers-middle-income-families-to-gain-sector-seeks-clarity-on-cess/articleshow/123695419.cms,"Diwali Gift for Consumers: Govt Slashes GST Across Sectors, Prices to Drop from Sept 22





The automobile industry has welcomed the GST Council’s decision to reduce tax rates on vehicles, calling it a timely step that will lift demand, make cars and two-wheelers more affordable, and particularly benefit first-time buyers and middle-income families.The new two-tier structure, announced on Wednesday, simplified levies to 5% and 18% from September 22, coinciding with the start of Navaratri.Industry leaders said the changes would inject fresh momentum into the sector and urged the government to quickly clarify rules on compensation cess on unsold vehicles to ensure a smooth transition.Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM) President Shailesh Chandra said the industry is pleased with the decision to reduce GST on vehicles to 18% and 40%.“This timely move is set to bring renewed cheer to consumers and inject fresh momentum into the Indian automotive sector,” he told PTI.“Making vehicles more affordable, particularly in the entry-level segment; these announcements will significantly benefit first-time buyers and middle-income families, enabling broader access to personal mobility.”C S Vigneshwar, President of the Federation of Automobile Dealers’ Associations (FADA), described the changes as “bold and progressive reforms” that simplify the tax structure and create consensus across states.“This is a decisive step that will boost affordability, spur demand, and make India’s mobility ecosystem stronger and more inclusive,” he said. “As the country heads into the peak festive season, glitch-free and implementation will be the key to ensuring that the benefits seamlessly reach customers.”TVS Motor Company chairman Sudarshan Venu said the cut was a major move to turbocharge growth.“It will significantly boost consumption across segments of the society. For our industry especially, it is a welcome move as it will help two-wheelers become more accessible and also help those looking to upgrade,” he was cited by PTI.Chandra also welcomed the continuation of the 5% GST rate on electric vehicles, saying it “will help sustain the ongoing momentum towards sustainable mobility”. He added that resolving classification issues and correcting the inverted duty structure would streamline business processes and support ease of doing business.He further expressed confidence that “the government will also soon notify suitable mechanisms for the utilisation of compensation cess on unsold vehicles, ensuring a smooth and effective transition”.Vigneshwar expressed similar concern, pointing out that “one area that may need earliest clarification is about levy and treatment of cess balances currently lying in dealers’ books, so that there is no ambiguity during transition”.Under the revised slabs, petrol, LPG and CNG vehicles with engines up to 1,200 cc and under 4,000 mm in length, as well as diesel vehicles up to 1,500 cc and 4,000 mm, will be taxed at 18%, down from 28% plus cess.Motorcycles up to 350 cc will also be taxed at 18% instead of 28%, PTI reported.Larger vehicles – above 1,200 cc and longer than 4,000 mm – along with motorcycles above 350 cc and racing cars, will face a 40% levy. Small hybrid cars will benefit from lower rates, while electric vehicles will continue at the 5% slab.","The automobile industry has welcomed the GST Council’s decision to reduce tax rates on vehicles.

Top stock market recommendations: According to Aakash K Hindocha, Deputy Vice President - WM Research, Nuvama Professional Clients Group, the top buy calls for today are: Dabur, Bajaj Auto, and Amara Raja Energy & Mobility. Here’s his view on Nifty, Bank Nifty and the top stock picks for September 4, 2025:Despite having an inside bar formation, Nifty recouped twice of its previous day’s losses adding 135pt in yesterday’s trade. The positive rub off on the back of better than expected GDP numbers is now digested by the market, however market participant are now eyeing the GST meet outcome due post market hours today. Given the set up on daily charts, an upswing towards 24900 / 25050 is now open with support seen at 24500. Momentum on the upside is likely to pick up once 24800 is crossed.Bank Nifty has recouped all of its previous day’s losses in Wednesday’s trading session. The index has so far missed its extended target of 53500 by a whisker which is now likely to act as support on downside. Bank Nifty continues to hover at 3.5 month low as its resistance has been trailed to 54100. Any sustenance above 54100 would allow the index for a breather short covering northwards to the tune of 1000 odd points with an SL seen at 53500.Given the momentum in FMCG names, Dabur has joined the list powered by a bullish (inverted) head and shoulder breakout on daily charts. The stock had been sustaining above its 200 DMA for the past 6 weeks now, while analysing the price volume action in Tuesday’s session, qualifies it for another 8-10% follow through rally on the upside.Adding to its ongoing bullish triangle breakout, Bajaj Auto has closed at a fresh 7 month high on daily charts. The stock has also crossed its long term 200 DMA average in the fortnight passed by after a gap of 9 months. Daily charts also indicate a higher low formation for the past 3-4 odd months suggesting presence of buyers at lower levels which could allow additional upside from current breakout.Given the sectoral traction on EV and rare earth names, battery stocks have started showing signs to end its ongoing consolidation. Amara Raja Energy & Mobility has now closed at a fresh 3 month high on the back of a sloping trendline breakout already witnessed in last week’s trading. Additional momentum could pick up above 1048 closing on the stock for targets of 10-15% higher from CMP. For now, we are eyeing 1092 as an initial target for this trade set up.","Top stock market recommendations: According to Aakash K Hindocha, Deputy Vice President - WM Research, Nuvama Professional Clients Group, the top buy calls for today are: Dabur, Bajaj Auto, and Amara Raja Energy & Mobility.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123689222,imgsize-76758,width-400,resizemode-4/top-stocks-to-buy.jpg"

Stock market recommendations:Benchmark Indices witnessed a recovery in the first half of the current week and formed a high of 24,980 in Thursday session as the Government introduced significant changes to the GST structure aimed at boosting consumption. The earlier 12% and 28% tax slabs have been eliminated, with most items shifted into lower 5% and 18% brackets. In addition, a new 40% category has been created, which effectively absorbs the previous compensation cess, except for tobacco products. These revisions will be effective from 22 September.Indexes witnessed profit booking at higher levels around 25,000 levels on Thursday session and closed the session around 24,750 levels.Index in the immediate short term is likely to consolidate in the range of 24,400-25,000 amid stock specific actions. On the higher side a move above 25,000 levels will open further upside towards the key resistance area of 25,200-25,250 levels.Immediate support is placed at 24,400-24,337 levels being the confluence of the recent lows and the key retracement area. A breach below the same will signal acceleration of decline towards the key support area of 24,000-23,800 levels in the coming week being the confluence of the 52-week EMA and the previous major lows and the previous major breakout area.Bank Nifty is seen consolidating around 200 days EMA amid stock specific actions.Going ahead, we expect the index to move above Thursday's high (54,450) and open further upside towards a major breakdown area of 54,800-55,000. Overall, we expect the index to extend consolidation in the range 53,300-55,000 in the coming sessions.Bank Nifty has immediate support at 53,500-53,300 levels being the confluence of the 200 day EMA and the low of May 2025. A breach below the same will signal acceleration of decline towards the key support area of 52,500-52,000 levels in the coming weekThe stock after the recent corrective decline is forming base at the 200 day EMA and the previous breakout area thus offers fresh entry opportunity with favorable risk-reward set up.In the smaller time frame, it has generated a falling channel breakout containing the last 6 sessions corrective decline thus offers fresh entry opportunity. Strong support is placed in the range of 1290-1270 levels being the confluence of last month’s low and 200 days EMA.We expect stocks to head higher towards 1438 levels, being the 80% retracement of the previous July-August decline (1474-1291).The stock is in a strong up trend and is seen taking support at the 20 days EMA. We expect the stock to extend the up move thus offering a fresh entry opportunity.The stock has outperformed the overall market and is likely to extend its current outperformance.We expect the stock to head towards 67 levels in the coming month being the 123.6% external retracement of the previous decline (65-57). The daily stochastic remains in an up trend thus supports the positive bias.","According to Bajaj Broking Research, the top stock picks for September 5, 2025 are Adani Ports, and Jayaswal Neco Industries.

US-Japan deal: Donald Trump signs executive order cutting Tokyo auto tariffs to 15%; check details,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-japan-deal-donald-trump-signs-executive-order-cutting-tokyo-auto-tariffs-to-15-check-details/articleshow/123710430.cms,"File photo: US President Donald Trump (Picture credit: AP)





US President Donald Trump on Thursday signed an executive order implementing tariff cuts under an agreement with Japan announced in July, lowering duties on Japanese automobile imports and formalising a $550 billion investment pledge.According to news agency Reuters, the order reduces the tariff on Japanese autos from 27.5% to 15%, with the change taking effect within seven days of its publication in the Federal Register.The modifications will also apply retroactively to goods shipped from August 7, the date higher duties on dozens of economies took effect, as per news agency AFP.Other imports from Japan that previously faced tariffs above 15% will not be subject to an additional levy, while goods below that rate will be adjusted to 15%.Japan’s top negotiator Ryosei Akazawa welcomed the move, telling reporters in Washington that the step was a “steady implementation of the agreement reached on July 22.” Akazawa’s trip marked his 10th round of talks with US officials. “Finally,” he posted on X, signalling relief after months of negotiations.But he also cautioned that the 15% tariff would “still cause damage to our nation’s industries,” adding that Tokyo would take “swift and necessary measures, like financing assistance” to support affected sectors, as per AFP.According to Japan Today, the order also granted Japan “reciprocal” treatment on duties, correcting an earlier omission when similar provisions were extended to the EU.A memorandum of understanding was signed between Akazawa and US commerce secretary Howard Lutnick, covering Japan’s planned “strategic investments” in the United States. “This is historic,” Lutnick said at the signing.The deal commits Japan to invest $550 billion in US projects through equity, loans, and guarantees from state-backed banks, with Washington retaining authority to select projects.Trump has said the United States will keep 90 percent of the profits from these investments, which Japan clarified will largely consist of loans and loan guarantees.Investments will target critical sectors such as minerals, semiconductors, and pharmaceuticals.Trump said the inflows would “generate hundreds of thousands of US jobs, expand domestic manufacturing, and secure American prosperity for generations.”As part of the arrangement, Japan has agreed to increase its annual purchases of US agricultural goods, including corn, soybeans, and fertiliser, to $8 billion, along with a 75% rise in rice imports.The agreement also includes Japan buying 100 Boeing planes and lifting defence spending with US firms to $17 billion annually, up from $14 billion, Reuters noted.Toyota, which last month estimated a $10 billion hit from earlier US tariffs, praised the order for providing “much needed clarity.”While shares of Japanese automakers rose slightly on Friday, South Korean carmakers remained under pressure as Seoul awaits a similar executive order from Washington.The deal comes at a sensitive moment for Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, whose leadership faces a test with his ruling party set to vote on a possible extraordinary election.Analysts cited by Reuters said that while finalising the trade pact could strengthen Ishiba’s position, he still faces internal backlash over rising living costs and weak economic growth.","US President Donald Trump on Thursday signed an executive order implementing tariff cuts under an agreement with Japan announced in July.

US President Donald Trump on Thursday announced that United States will impose a ""fairly substantial tariff"" on computer chips coming into the country, during a White House dinner with tech industry executives.""We will be putting a tariff very shortly,"" Trump said at the White House, adding, ""Not that high, but fairly substantial tariff.""However, the US president didn't provide details or a timetable for the new levy. He has repeatedly threatened in the past to impose tariffs on chips.Earlier in August, Trump said that he will announce a 100% tariff on semiconductors from firms that do not invest in the US. The statement from Trump had provoked volatility in Asian chipmaker shares.""We'll be putting a tariff of approximately 100 per cent on chips and semiconductors, but if you're building in the United States...there's no charge,"" Trump said at the time.Amid trade war, US and China are also locked in a high-stakes race to develop high-end semiconductors, which are essential for artificial intelligence systems.Meanwhile, Trump on Wednesday sought a swift ruling from the Supreme Court over tariffs after an appeals court found it illegal and requested to overturn the decision.However, the court only considered the legality of his most sweeping tariffs and not sector-specific levies, such as those on steel and, potentially, semiconductors.","US President Donald Trump announced that United States will impose a ""fairly substantial tariff"" on computer chips coming into the country.

President Donald Trump on Thursday (US local time) signed an executive order formally implementing the US-Japan trade agreement, a landmark pact that lowers tariffs on Japanese autos to 15% and secures a $550 billion investment pledge from Tokyo, the White House announced.The White House confirmed the move in a statement posted on X.Under the agreement, nearly all Japanese imports entering the United States will face a baseline tariff of 15%. For automobiles, the rate drops from 27.5 % to 15% — a significant victory for Japanese automakers.In a statement, the White House emphasised Tokyo’s unprecedented investment pledge: “Critically, unlike any other agreement in American history, the Government of Japan has agreed to invest $550 billion in the United States.”The projects will be selected by US officials and are expected to create thousands of jobs, strengthen domestic manufacturing, and boost infrastructure. Japan has also agreed to purchase US-made commercial aircraft and defense equipment.The executive order also outlines sector-specific treatment for automobiles and parts, aerospace products, generic pharmaceuticals, and natural resources not produced in the USJapan pledged to increase rice imports under its Minimum Access rice scheme and commit to annual purchases of American corn, soybeans, fertilizer, and bioethanol — a package worth about $8 billion.According to the executive order, the agreement “levels the playing field for American producers, accounts for national security needs, expands US exports and investment-driven production, and helps reduce the trade deficit with Japan.”The changes will take effect within seven days of being published in the Federal Register. The signing coincided with the arrival of Japan’s lead negotiator, Ryosei Akazawa, in Washington for another round of talks.The announcement came just as Japan’s lead trade negotiator, Akazawa Ryosei, departed Thursday for a three-day visit to Washington for a new round of talks, reported ANI.","President Donald Trump on Thursday (US local time) signed an executive order formally implementing the US-Japan trade agreement.

US trade: Businesses front-load imports ahead of tariffs in July; deficit hits widest in 4 months,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-trade-businesses-front-load-imports-ahead-of-tariffs-in-july-deficit-hits-widest-in-4-months/articleshow/123702976.cms,"



The US trade gap widened sharply in July, hitting its largest level in four months, as businesses rushed in imports ahead of fresh tariffs from US President Donald Trump.Figures from the department of commerce on Thursday showed the deficit rose by 32.5% to $78.3 billion. Imports jumped 5.9% to $358.8 billion, while exports increased only slightly, up 0.3% to $280.5 billion.""While imports bounced back in July, more than half of the increase was due to gold as trade policy and safe-haven demand brought about a resurgence in trade,"" said Matthew Martin, senior economist at Oxford Economics told AFP.""Excluding gold, imports rose by a more modest 3.3%, while exports fell 0.1%,"" Martin added.Pantheon Macroeconomics analysts described the widening shortfall as the result of ""another wave of pre-tariff stockpiling.""Trump initially introduced a 10% tariff on most trading partners in April. Plans to raise these levies were postponed twice before taking effect in early August, affecting key allies such as the European Union, Japan and India.Economists believe businesses that front-loaded imports are now running low on existing stocks, meaning they will soon face higher costs when they place new orders.For now, however, the broader impact on inflation in the US remains limited.A Briefing.com poll of forecasters had expected the deficit to come in much smaller, at $64.2 billion.Martin noted that strong demand for capital goods linked to artificial intelligence and data centres had also pushed up imports. The Commerce Department added that inflows of industrial supplies and consumer goods both rose strongly.Trade with China played a significant role, with the US goods deficit widening by $5.3 billion to $14.7 billion in July.""Unsurprisingly, given the level of tariffs, China has been the hardest hit of all trading partners,"" Martin said. Goods from the world’s second-largest economy are now subject to an additional 30% tariff this year, while other Asian nations face lower rates.Trump’s tariff strategy has rattled global supply chains, with import surges recorded as early as March, before his wide-ranging duties began in April. Alongside general tariffs, Washington has also imposed separate charges on steel, aluminium and automobiles, with the White House signalling that more measures are still to come.","Imports jumped 5.9% to $358.8 billion, while exports increased only slightly, up 0.3%.

US job market: Jobless benefit applications see slight increase; America maintains 'no hire no fire' pace,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-job-market-jobless-benefit-applications-see-slight-increase-america-maintains-no-hire-no-fire-pace/articleshow/123702359.cms,"



The number of Americans applying for unemployment benefits increased slightly last week, reflecting that employers are retaining workers despite the economy showing signs of slowing down.According to the figures released by the US labour department on Thursday, for the week ending 30 August, jobless claims rose by 8,000 to 237,000. The rise was higher than the 231,000 applications economists had predicted.Unemployment benefit claims are often seen as an indicator of layoffs, and they have mostly stayed within a healthy range of 200,000 to 250,000 since the US emerged from the pandemic almost four years ago.Despite layoffs remaining relatively low, hiring has weakened, with economists calling it a “no hire, no fire” economy. The jobless rate remains low at 4.2%.New government data earlier this week showed employers had 7.2 million job vacancies at the end of July, fewer than expected and another sign of labour market weakness.Last month’s disappointing July jobs report, which recorded only 73,000 new positions and revised previous months sharply down, unsettled financial markets.In its wake, US President Donald Trump dismissed the head of the agency responsible for compiling the monthly figures.Attention is now turning to the August employment report, due on Friday. Economists expect employers to have added around 80,000 private non-farm jobs. Wall Street and the Federal Reserve are watching closely, as recent figures suggest hiring has slowed dramatically since spring.Over the past three months, job creation has averaged just 35,000 a month, about a quarter of last year’s pace. Businesses have been pulling back on expansion plans amid uncertainty over Trump’s tariff policies, contributing to a broader slowdown.The economy expanded at an annual rate of 1.3% in the first half of 2025, compared with 2.5% last year.Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell has already indicated that interest rates could be cut at the central bank’s next meeting on 16–17 September to ease borrowing costs on mortgages, car finance and business loans.Thursday’s report also showed the four-week moving average of claims rose by 2,500 to 231,000. The total number of people receiving unemployment benefits for the week ending 23 August slipped by 4,000 to 1.94 million.","Jobless claims rose by 8,000 to 237,000 in the week ending 30 August.

US stock market today: Wall Street trades in green; Dow jumps 50 points; S&P gains 0.1%,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-stock-market-today-wall-street-trades-in-green-dow-jumps-50-points-sp-gains-0-1/articleshow/123701483.cms,"



Wall Street traded in green on Thursday as pressure from the bond market eased and investors closely watched signs of weakness in the US labour market.The S&P 500 gained 0.17% or 10 points to reach 6,459. Dow Jones Industrial Average began the day in red but jumped 54 points or 0.12%, trading at 45,325 at 7.55 PM IST. Nasdaq followed the suit, jumping to 21,524, rising 0.13% or 27 points.Treasury yields eased following discouraging signals on jobs, with reports pointing to weaker hiring among private employers last month and a potential rise in layoffs last week.Neither report signalled towards a recession, but a cooling jobs market could prompt the Federal Reserve to cut its main interest rate for the first time this year in the coming weeks. A more comprehensive employment report is due on Friday.Shares of American Eagle Outfitters surged 26% after the teen fashion retailer posted more than double Wall Street’s expected second-quarter profit late Wednesday. The company benefitted from intense media attention in late July over its deliberately provocative campaign featuring 27-year-old actor Sydney Sweeney.Google gave back a fraction of Wednesday’s 9.1% rally, slipping less than 1% before the bell.The tech giant had jumped after avoiding some of the worst-case scenarios in its antitrust trial.Later Thursday, the government is set to release its latest weekly layoffs data, paving the way for the crucial August jobs report on Friday. On Wednesday, official figures showed that US employers had 7.2 million job openings at the end of July, fewer than economists expected, marking another sign of a weakening labour market.The deteriorating outlook has bolstered expectations that the Fed will lower rates at its meeting later this month. Last month’s July jobs report, which included sharp downward revisions for June and May, rattled markets and led President Donald Trump to sack the head of the agency responsible for compiling the figures.Lower interest rates could help shore up both the labour market and the wider economy, but the risk remains that easing policy could stoke inflation at a time when Trump’s tariffs may already be pushing up the cost of imports.In Europe, Germany’s DAX climbed 0.8% by midday, while London’s FTSE 100 edged up 0.2% and the CAC 40 in Paris slipped 0.1%.Asian markets were largely positive.

Putin Lashes Out At German Chancellor After ‘War Criminal’ Jibe Amid Ukraine Truce Delay





Russian President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday dismissed the Ukraine conflict as a mere “pretext” used by Western powers to impose broader punitive measures against countries engaged in strong economic relations with Moscow.Speaking to the media after concluding a four-day visit to China, Putin argued that recent trade restrictions and tariffs were being justified under the Ukraine narrative but, in reality, pursued unrelated political and economic agendas.“The Ukraine situation is only a pretext to take various steps against countries that have economic ties with us,” he said, according to ANI.He pointed to tariffs imposed on Brazil earlier in August as an example of trade penalties that had no direct link to the Ukraine conflict. Putin said the actual reasons behind these measures were economic imbalances between the West, particularly the United States and major economies like India, China and Brazil.“There is a trade disproportion between the United States and India or with China, but there is no situation between Brazil and the United States, for example. And, by the way, Brazil faced additional tariffs on the 6th of August, even though the deadline was the 8th of August.So what does Ukraine have to do with this? Nothing. It's only about domestic politics... Ukraine doesn't have anything to do with that. So, of course, there is some imbalance in trade, but I believe that those should be addressed through negotiations,"" the Putin added.The Russian President’s remarks come at a time when Washington’s tariff policies have heightened global trade tensions. India, in particular, faces uncertainty after the US imposed a 50 per cent tariff on imports, alongside an additional 25 per cent linked to its purchase of Russian crude oil.Washington has argued that India’s crude imports indirectly support Moscow’s war effort.In the same press briefing, Putin also said he remained open to meeting Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, provided such a meeting was well-prepared and aimed at achieving a constructive outcome. “If Zelenskyy is ready, he can come to Moscow. This is quite possible,” he said, while reiterating Moscow’s opposition to Ukraine’s Nato membership but showing less resistance to its European Union ambitions.Meanwhile, frustration has been rising in Europe over Moscow’s stance. As per news agency AFP, European leaders are gathering in Paris with Ukrainian President Zelenskyy to push for stronger security guarantees for Kyiv, warning that Russia remains unwilling to strike a peace deal.French President Emmanuel Macron said allies were ready to offer guarantees “the day that a peace accord is signed,” while Ukraine’s foreign minister dismissed Putin’s Moscow invitation as “knowingly unacceptable.”","Vladimir Putin dismisses Ukraine conflict as a mere “pretext” used by Western powers to impose punitive measures against countries engaged in strong economic relations with Moscow.

‘Much more needs to be done’: COP30 finance goal far behind with just 4-5% achieved; experts urge urgent action by 2030,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/much-more-needs-to-be-done-cop30-finance-goal-far-behind-with-just-4-5-achieved-experts-urge-urgent-action-by-2030/articleshow/123674313.cms,"AI image





The global funding target set for COP30 is far behind schedule, with only 4-5 per cent of the promised $1.3 trillion achieved so far, claimed Vishwas Chitale, Fellow, Climate Resilience at the Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW).In an exclusive interview to news agency ANI, Chitale stressed that the $1.3 trillion target is crucial for climate action, yet progress has been slow. “Around 4-5 per cent of the target of 1.3 trillion dollar is achieved. We are really lagging behind the target. All the developing countries are supposed to contribute by 2030,” he said, while adding that if COP30 accelerates its efforts, the goal remains achievable.Chitale underlined that the momentum of climate finance remains largely dependent on developed nations, which have been the main contributors so far. “There is funding from developed countries for developing countries. Developing countries should stand for their commitments,” he pointed out.He explained that COP30 is not only focused on finance but also on broader synergies, including Rio synergies, climate action, and community resilience.“As a whole we can improve the land use and land cover practices. The main agenda is how COP30 delivers on the climate finance of $1.3 trillion and can we see some action happening on that,” he said.Recalling previous progress, Chitale said that while the loss and damage fund initiated at COP27 saw movement at the Dubai COP, “much more needs to be done to translate commitments into action, especially to meet the 2030 target.”On India’s role, he noted that the country has emerged as a strong voice for the Global South, leading negotiations on adaptation finance and resilience. He highlighted initiatives like the Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure (CDRI), the Prime Minister’s ten-point agenda on disaster reduction, and Mission Life, describing them as “excellent steps.”Earlier, Andre Aranha Correa do Lago, President of COP30, was quoted by ANI as saying that developed countries carry “more responsibility” for climate change, having been responsible for carbon dioxide accumulation “for more than 250 years.”He stressed that Brazil and India, as part of the BASIC group, have been united in their negotiations, with both emerging economies expected to play a key role at COP30 in Belem this November.A Moody’s report, which came out earlier this year, had also warned that many governments are falling short of the Paris Agreement’s climate targets, with delays pushing countries to prioritise adaptation and resilience investments.The report flagged risks of a “climate investment trap” for emerging markets if funding gaps persist.Chitale concluded that more awareness and concrete action are needed to accelerate climate finance delivery. “It has a lot to deliver on that,” he said, pointing to COP30’s responsibility to ensure progress on both funding and resilience building.","Only 4-5 per cent of the promised $1.3 trillion has been achieved, claims Vishwas Chitale, Fellow, Climate Resilience at the Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW) The momentum of climate finance remains largely dependent on developed nations, which have been the main contributors.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123674345,imgsize-329111,width-400,resizemode-4/thriving-community-climate-resilience.jpg"

'Respect India Or West Will Lose': NATO Ally Finland President Stubb Warns Trump Amid Tariff War

Trump’s tariff plan for pharma





US President Donald Trump is mulling tariffs on the pharmaceutical sector - as high as 200%! Trump intends to levy substantial import duties on pharmaceutical products, a sector that has largely remained unaffected by his trade policies. Historically, imported medicines have entered the United States without customs duties.Recent developments indicate a shift in this approach. A trade agreement between the US and European nations has established a 15% tariff on certain European imports, including pharmaceutical products. Trump has indicated potential duties exceeding 200% on medications produced in other regions.PwC's tax specialist Maytee Pereira characterises Trump's pharmaceutical strategy by stating: ""Shock and awe. This is an industry that's going from zero (tariffs) to the potentiality of 200%,” Maytee Pereira told AP.The proposal to reduce drug costs for Americans through pharmaceutical tariffs could have unintended consequences. Such measures might actually increase prices, create supply chain complications, reduce access to affordable foreign-made generic medications, and lead to medicine shortages, according to the AP report.""A tariff would hurt consumers most of all, as they would feel the inflationary effect ... directly when paying for prescriptions at the pharmacy and indirectly through higher insurance premiums,'' Diederik Stadig, a healthcare economist with the financial services firm ING, wrote in a commentary last month, adding that lower-income households and the elderly would feel the greatest impact.This initiative coincides with ongoing pressure on pharmaceutical companies to reduce prices in the United States. Letters have been sent to various companies requesting plans for implementing most-favoured nation pricing domestically.However, the proposed tariffs include a grace period of 12 to 18 months, allowing pharmaceutical companies to build inventory reserves and relocate production facilities to the United States, actions some firms have already initiated.According to Leerink Partners analyst David Risinger's July 29 note, numerous pharmaceutical companies have increased their drug imports and maintained six to 18 months of stock within the United States.The financial expert David Windley from Jefferies indicated in his analysis that the impact of proposed tariffs scheduled for late 2026 might not be noticeable until 2027 or 2028, as companies would likely build up inventory.Industry observers anticipate that Trump would likely implement a tariff significantly below 200%. They are also observing whether specific products, particularly low-margin generic medications, would receive exemptions from these tariffs.According to Stadig's assessment, even a modest 25% tariff would result in a gradual increase of 10% to 14% in US pharmaceutical prices once existing stocks are depleted.Pharmaceutical companies have increasingly relocated their operations abroad over the past several decades, seeking cost advantages in China and India, whilst benefiting from tax incentives in Ireland and Switzerland. This shift has contributed to a substantial US trade deficit in pharmaceutical products, approaching £150 billion in the previous year.The global health crisis during COVID-19 highlighted the vulnerabilities of depending on international sources for medical supplies, particularly when nations prioritised their domestic needs. This situation became especially concerning when considering China, a significant supplier and strategic competitor to America.In April, the US government initiated an investigation into the national security implications of pharmaceutical imports. Under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, the president holds authority to impose tariffs when national security concerns arise.Health policy analyst Marta Wosińska at the Brookings Institution advocates for tariffs to protect US medical supplies. She highlighted how the Biden administration's taxation on foreign syringes protected US manufacturers from inexpensive Chinese imports.Trump advocates for relocating pharmaceutical manufacturing to the United States, suggesting US-manufactured drugs would be exempt from his proposed tariffs.Pharmaceutical companies are increasing their US investments. In April, Roche, the Swiss pharmaceutical company, announced a $50 billion expansion of its US operations. Johnson & Johnson plans to invest $55 billion in the United States over four years. Their CEO Joaquin Duato indicated plans to exclusively manufacture US market drugs within the country.However, establishing new pharmaceutical facilities in the United States requires substantial investment and extended time periods.Furthermore, US-based manufacturing might still face tariff implications if imported ingredients are taxed. According to Jacob Jensen, trade policy analyst at the American Action Forum, ""97% of antibiotics, 92% of antivirals and 83% of the most popular generic drugs contain at least one active ingredient that is manufactured abroad.""The complete protection against tariffs requires establishing the entire supply chain within the United States, according to Pereira.Whilst branded pharmaceutical companies maintain substantial profit margins allowing them to handle investments and tariff costs, generic manufacturers operate with limited financial flexibility.Several generic manufacturers might exit the US market due to tariff pressures. This poses significant concerns as generics constitute 92% of US retail and mail-order pharmacy prescriptions.A temporary production halt at an Indian facility previously resulted in chemotherapy shortages, affecting cancer treatment. ""Those are not very resilient markets,"" Brookings' Wosińska said. ""If there's a shock, it's hard for them to recover.""Wosińska contends that tariffs alone cannot convince generic manufacturers to establish US-based facilities without governmental financial support.""In an ideal world, we would be making everything that's important only in the US,'' Wosińska said. ""But it costs a lot of money ... We have offshored so much of our supply chains because we want to have inexpensive drugs. If we want to reverse this, we would really have to redesign our system ... How much are we willing to spend?''","US President Donald Trump is mulling tariffs on the pharmaceutical sector. Trump intends to levy substantial import duties on pharmaceutical products. The proposal to reduce drug costs for Americans through pharmaceutical tariffs could have unintended consequences. Such measures might actually increase prices, create supply chain complications, reduce access to affordable foreign-made generic medications, and lead to medicine shortages.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123673084,imgsize-85378,width-400,resizemode-4/trump-tariffs-on-pharma.jpg"

'Economic Blackmail': Rahul Gandhi, Shashi Tharoor Rips Into Trump's 50% Tariff Move





Indian-origin Congressman Rohit ""Ro"" Khanna on Tuesday sharply criticised US president Donald Trump’s decision to impose 50 per cent tariffs on Indian goods, warning it threatens decades of US-India strategic cooperation.Khanna, a Democrat and co-chair of the United States-India Caucus, accused Trump of 'undermining' three decades of bipartisan efforts that had strengthened the strategic US-India alliance.""I want to sound the five-alarm fire (alert for an exceptionally large and destructive fire) on what Donald Trump is doing to destroy the US-India relationship,"" Khanna said in a video posted on his X handle.The California representative added: ""He (Trump) has imposed a 50 per cent tariff on India, higher (joint-highest) than any other country other than Brazil. It's a higher tariff than the tariff on China. It is hurting India's exports of leather and textiles into the United States. And it's hurting American manufacturers and our exports into India. It is also driving India towards China and towards Russia.""Khanna also said the tariffs are pushing India closer to China and Russia - Washington's traditional rivals - and attributed the action to New Delhi’s refusal to nominate Trump for a Nobel Peace Prize, despite his repeated claims of mediating the India-Pakistan conflict.""Now, why is this happening? For very simple reasons. Prime Minister Modi refused to nominate Donald Trump for a Nobel Peace Prize. Well, Pakistan did. And India has said that the border dispute with Pakistan is an internal matter, refusing to give Donald Trump credit,"" Khanna stated.The Congressman also stressed the strategic importance of the US-India relationship.""We can't allow the ego of Donald Trump to destroy a strategic relationship with India that is key to ensuring that America leads and not China. To all those Indian-Americans who voted for Donald Trump, I'm asking you, where are you today while he destroys this relationship?"" he remarked.Twenty-five percent of the tariffs imposed by Washington target New Delhi, citing its alleged support of Russian leader Vladimir Putin’s war effort in Ukraine through Russian oil purchases.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground.Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change, too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Startups will play an important role in helping India become the third largest economy in the world, Chief Economic Advisor (CEA) to the Union government V Anantha Nageswaran has said.Nageswaran said that tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country due to improvements in infrastructure and supportive policies of the government, according to a KSUM release.The CEA, during his Leadership Talk on the concluding day of the Huddle Global 2023 organised by the Kerala Startup Mission (KSUM), said that India was the fifth largest economy on course to become the third largest in a few years.""In fact, I will say 7-in-7 is the buzz slogan, that is 7 trillion USD economy in seven years. Seven trillion USD economy size by 2030 is possible if India maintains its present growth trajectory, and in that journey startup entrepreneurs are going to play an important role,"" he is quoted as having said in the release.He was of the view that the active participation of startups in India in developing business models on the foundation of expanding physical and digital infrastructure will continue to generate efficiency, revenue and economic returns for the country.""The last decade has seen an exceptional transformation in the startup landscape in India, which has emerged as the third largest ecosystem globally, with over 1.12 lakh startups presently recognised by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) across 763 districts.""Among them, more than 110 are unicorns with a total valuation of around USD 350 billion,"" he said.The CEA further said that the country ranks second in innovation quality.He said that innovation in India was not just limited to certain sectors as startups were solving problems in 56 industrial sectors, with 13 per cent of them from IT services, nine per cent from health and life sciences, seven per cent from education, five per cent from agriculture and five per cent from food and beverages.Nageswaran also said it was significant that 49 per cent of the startups were from tier-2 and 3 cities which have turned to be game-changers as the business advantages in these locations enable entrepreneurs to operate at lower costs as compared to tier-1 cities.""Apart from improved infrastructure and the government's pro-active policies, the availability of a technically skilled talent pool is a huge advantage for startups to set up and flourish in tier-2 and tier-3 cities,"" he said.He said that historically there was a perception that small towns were difficult places to conduct business.""...but with improved internet penetration, vastly better physical infrastructure, road, rail and air connectivity and supportive government policies, this is no longer true,"" he said.He also noted Kerala's startup journey has been an inspiring one.The CEA said that KSUM has served as the catalyst since its establishment in 2006 to promote change that propelled the state into the forefront of the global startup arena.KSUM is the Kerala government's nodal agency established in 2006 for entrepreneurship development and incubation activities in the state.Nageswaran said that with over 4,000 registered tech startups, 63 incubators and 10 lakh square feet of incubation space, KSUM has not only met its goal of promoting technology-based entrepreneurship but has also earned the distinguished position of being among the world's top business incubators.The November 16-18 fifth edition of Huddle Global, India's biggest beachside startup conclave, was organised by KSUM at Adimalathura beach, near Vizhinjam, here.Attended by around 1,500 delegates, the event displayed sophisticated products from emerging sectors such as robotics, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, life sciences, space tech, blockchain, IoT, e-governance, fintech, healthtech, agritech, edutech and SaaS from across the country.","Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran said tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country.

E-Commerce startup Udaan to trim costs ahead of 2025 IPO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/e-commerce-startup-udaan-to-trim-costs-ahead-of-2025-ipo/articleshow/105001132.cms,"E-commerce startup Udaan is working to curb costs and forge new partnerships with consumer brands in India as it prepares to go public in 2025.Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta said in an interview. That’s set to happen around the same time as its initial public offering, he said.The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said. “Second, strategically we want to ensure that we are top of mind with shopkeepers, with big manufacturers, and we maintain our relative market share.”Lightspeed Venture Partners-backed Udaan is among startups trying to tap the rapid growth of India’s economy and consumer market, while meeting investor demands for profitability. Udaan, which at its peak employed thousands, joined fellow Indian startups in slashing jobs last year and tightening internal controls and compliance. It now has about 1,800 staff, and Gupta didn’t specify if further job cuts are needed.Corporate governance lapses at Indian online tutoring firm Byju’s, once the country’s top startup with a valuation of $22 billion, shone a light at unique challenges faced by founders in the South Asian nation and drove companies to be more diligent.“We continue to move towards more professionalized management, professionalized board and also institutionalized shareholders as we go towards public markets,” Gupta said.Udaan is yet to decide whether it will list in India or overseas. It was valued at more than $3 billion in a 2021 funding round, and was in talks to raise $400 million, Business Standard reported in September. Lightspeed owns about 35% of Udaan, while Tencent Holdings Ltd. holds 6%.The company was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran Udaan until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021. The other two founders — Amod Malviya and Sujeet Kumar — are board members.Udaan built an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business still accounts for a very small part of India’s overall retail market but can balloon to $150 billion in sales and yield a 100% return on capital invested in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co. estimates published in the Mint newspaper.Bengaluru-based Udaan has also ventured into financing through its fintech unit which helps shopkeepers get working capital loans to buy inventory. That business is profitable before taxes and is growing 70% annually, Gupta said.“That’s a second business in the overall umbrella of Udaan trying to organize trade in the country,” Gupta said. “In addition to commerce, financing becomes an important market opportunity.”","Udaan will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta says.

How India's GDP has been growing

What SBI report said on savings and investment

Incremental capital output ratio

NEW DELHI: India's gross domestic product (GDP) data for the third quarter (October-December 2022) received a word of caution from the former Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Raghuram Rajan In an interview with news agency PTI, Rajan that India is ""dangerously close"" to the Hindu rate of growth in view of subdued private sector investment, high interest rates and slowing global growth.India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%.Rajan termed this sequential slowdown in growth as ""worrying"".However, a report released by the State Bank of India (SBI) economists on Tuesday dismissed arguments that India is dangerously close to Hindu rate of growth saying such statements are ""ill-conceived, biased and premature"".The term 'Hindu growth rate' was coined by late economist Raj Krishna in 1978 to describe the slow growth in the country.It basically refers to the low pace of economic growth rates during 1950s to 1980s. During this period, the Indian economy averaged 3.5%.A former lecturer at the Delhi School of Economics (DSE), Krishna noted that only if the rate of growth is persistently slow and accompanied by low per-capita GDP, then it will be known as Hindu rate of growth but it has to factor in population growth as well.Before economic reforms of 1991, India's economic growth remained stagnant and low, while per capita income averaged around 1.3%. Krishna termed this low growth situation to be a result of socialist policies of state control and import substitution.However, the economic situation changed when liberalisation, privatisation and globalisation (LPG) reforms came into effect in the year 1991, at a time when India faced balance of payment crisis.Over the years, many economists have strongly opposed the idea of 'Hindu growth rate' and the term never had universal acceptance.The Indian economy plunged into its very first technical recession in FY21 due to the impact of Covid-19 pandemic and the related nationwide lockdowns. GDP shrunk by an unprecedented 23.8% in the first quarter of the financial year 2020-21. However, due to spurt in economic activities in the subsequent quarters, the GDP decline started to narrow.However, if we look at the period before Covid-19 as well, India's growth curve shows a declining trend.From 8.26% in FY17, GDP growth plunged to 3.74% in FY20. Shutdown of economic activities in FY21 in wake of Covid-19 only made matters worse.As lockdowns started to ease and business activities resumed, India's GDP also started rising. In Q1 of FY22, growth jumped to 20.1% mainly on account of low base effect. By the fourth quarter of FY22, growth came down to 4.10%.Similarly, the new financial year 2022-23 brought fresh economic challenges in the form of Russia-Ukraine war that impacted almost all major economies of the world, slowed the pace of growth, pushed inflation to record highs.As a result, the central banks of all advanced economies spurred into action and opted for monetary policy tightening to curb the soaring inflation.With persistently rising interest rates, India's economy grew by 4.4% in Q3 of FY23, as the Centre revised upwards GDP growth for previous year to 9.10% from 8.7% earlier.The report weighed recent GDP numbers against the available data on savings and investments for the past decade and highlighted some interesting points.""Quarterly growth numbers are noisy and should be best avoided for any serious interpretation (on an average, India's GDP growth has witnessed Rs 2 lakh crore upward revision for the 3 year ended FY23),"" the report said.Gross capital formation (GCF) by the government touched a high of 11.8% in 2021-22, up from 10.7% in 2020-21.""This also had a domino effect on private sector investment that jumped from 10 per cent to 10.8% over the same period,"" it said.In fact, Ecowrap added that the trends in GCF to gross output ratio or the plough back of funds for creation of fresh capacity shows that for public administration the ratio attained fresh peak in 2021-22 owing to the emphasis on capital expenditure in recent budgets.At the aggregate level, gross capital formation is supposed to have crossed 32% in 2022-23, the highest level since 2018-19.According to the report, in 2021-22, gross savings have risen to 30% from 29% in 2020-21.""The ratio is supposed to have crossed 31 per cent in 2022-23, the highest since 2018-19. The household savings increased sharply during the pandemic period on account of sharp accretion in financial savings such as deposits,"" said the report by SBI's Economic Research Department.While household financial savings have since then moderated from 15.4% in 2020-21 to 11.1% in 2022-23, savings in physical assets have grown sharply to 11.8% in 2021-22 from 10.7% in 2020-21.The report further analysed Incremental Capital Output ratio (ICOR) -- which measures additional units of capital (investment) needed to produce additional units of output. It said that the ratio has been improving.""ICOR which was 7.5 in FY 12 is now only 3.5 in FY22. Clearly, only half of capital is now needed for next unit of output,"" the report noted.Such reducing ICOR in the current years reflects a relatively increasing efficiency of capital and shows that the economy is on a sound footing, the report said.""From that point of view, future GDP growth rates even at 7% could still mean a decent number by any standards!,"" it added.","India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%.

An employee is entitled for a 50 per cent amount of the last drawn salary as pension.OPS was discontinued by the NDA government in 2003 with effect from April 1, 2004.Under the new pension scheme (NPS), employees contribute 10 per cent of their basic salary towards pension while the government contributes 14 per cent.Governments of Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand have informed the central government/ Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA about their decision to restart OPS for their employees.The government of Punjab on November 18, 2022, issued a notification regarding implementation of OPS for the state government employees who are being covered under NPS.

The meeting was chaired by Food Secretary Sanjeev Chopra.Out of the total wheat procurement target for the 2022-23 marketing year (April-March), Punjab will aim to procure 2.5 million tonnes wheat, Haryana 1.5 million tonnes and Madhya Pradrsh 2 million tonnes, the food ministry said in a statement.Wheat procurement had declined last year due to a fall in domestic production and higher exports.However, the government has projected a record wheat production at 112.18 million tonnes in the 2023-24 crop year (July-June) as per the second estimate of the agriculture ministry.Besides wheat, the government has also fixed rabi (winter) rice procurement target at 10.6 million tonnes in the 2022-23 marketing year.States have been advised to enhance rice milling capacity so that milling of one season gets completed before the commencement of next season and recycling of rice may be avoided.Whereas procurement of millets and coarse grains is estimated to be 7,50,000 tonnes this year, higher than 6,30,000 tonnes in 2021-22. Karnataka will procure 6,00,000 tonnes of millets this year, the statement added.Separately addressing the conference, food minister Piyush Goyal urged all state governments to implement smart-PDS at the earliest.He lauded Andhra Pradesh government's Command Control and stated that the central government will work together for implementing it in other states also.On the storage front, the Union minister said FCI is upgrading godowns into five-star rated ones and state governments can also upgrade their godowns.In the conference, all the state governments were told to learn from the best practice of using millets in schemes like mid-day meal and PDS in Karnataka, which is helpful in adding nutrition and promoting healthy diet.States were encouraged to procure more millets and coarse grains. All the state governments were asked to open procurement centres for coarse grains in producing districts, especially, in tribal areas.

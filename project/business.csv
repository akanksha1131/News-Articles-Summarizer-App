Small Wonders of India's Exports

India's Exports

India’s exports basket is seeing a big growth with some surprise items! The country’s export portfolio is diversifying with significant growth in unexpected items like bananas, ghee, furniture, office supplies, and solar photovoltaic (PV) modules. Whilst traditional exports like engineering goods, pharmaceuticals, gems and jewellery remain dominant, these emerging sectors are providing additional momentum to overseas trade.India's export performance requires diversification, particularly given the 4.83% decline in goods exports during November, affecting sectors like petroleum products, gems and jewellery, iron ore, and agricultural produce.The commerce and industry ministry has set an ambitious target to surpass £800 billion in combined goods and services exports for FY25.""Banana is among the 20 agri products we have identified whose exports we want to boost as, at present, India's share is low in their global exports,"" an official told ET.The government has identified several agricultural products including watermelons, ghee, guavas, green chilli, capsicum, okra, garlic, onions and alcoholic beverages for export promotion.India aims to increase its global export share to 4-5% in the coming years from the current 2.5%. Countries like the US, Malaysia, Canada, Russia, Germany, France, South Korea, China, Indonesia, Japan, Italy, Belgium and the UK present substantial opportunities.""The acceptance for Indian single malt whisky is growing in the EU, US and the far East,"" said Anant Iyer, director general, Confederation of Indian Alcoholic Beverage Companies (CIABC).Alcoholic beverage exports increased by 8% year-on-year during April-October, with whisky exports rising by 16%. Officials also noted growth in specific spice exports, particularly black pepper.Office stationery products are gaining popularity in markets like Nicaragua, El Salvador and Cyprus. India has become the sixth largest exporter of solar PV modules globally, with its share in global exports increasing to 2.51% in 2023 from 0.4% in 2013.Also Read | Top 10 Countries With Highest Gold Reserves 2024: India Moves Up Ranks! Where do the US, China Stand? Check List During April-October, India's exports of PV cells in modules or panels reached $711.95 million, with the US receiving 96% of these shipments. According to Deepali Agrawal, deputy managing director of India Exim Bank, toy exports are expected to maintain their growth trajectory.""Furthermore, the export of dyes, organic chemicals, and inorganic chemicals is projected to remain strong, supported by improving global demand sentiments,"" she said.The PLI schemes are expected to bolster electronics and engineering goods sectors, maintaining their position as key growth drivers.""The automotive sector is also set to witness a surge in export revenues, underpinned by improving global demand in key markets and the adoption of the China+1 strategy by global players, which is driving diversification in sourcing and manufacturing locations,"" Agrawal said.""India's apparel exports are also likely to maintain their upward trajectory.""Despite potential challenges in petroleum product exports, analysts indicate that non-oil merchandise and services exports will lead the country's overall export performance. The government is actively exploring new markets, including France, Saudi Arabia and Kenya for iron ore exports.For pharmaceutical exports, the focus is on Latvia, Chad and Montenegro, whilst Greece and Croatia are being targeted for engineering goods. Additionally, Guatemala and Morocco are being developed as new destinations for Indian cotton yarn exports.","The commerce and industry ministry has set an ambitious target to surpass £800 billion in combined goods and services exports for FY25.

There has been an almost 30% year-on-year inflation in palm oil - a key ingredient used in the aforementioned products, analysts at Nuvama Institutional Equities said in a note. ""Due to price hikes, consumers are going for smaller packs (in these categories) which negatively impacts volume,"" they said.Hit by inflation, FMCG firms have taken price hikes in the Dec quarter. Companies like Hindustan Unilever (HUL), Godrej Consumer Products (GCPL) have taken nearly 10% price hikes in soaps while players like Bikaji and Tata Consumer have increased prices of their range of snacks and tea respectively. More price hikes are expected by some companies in the current quarter, analysts said. ""We are in the process of taking one or two more price hikes and I think that should be enough,"" Saugata Gupta, MD & CEO at Marico, told TOI in a recent interview.Growth of FMCG firms has been sluggish due to weak urban demand even as rural markets have been growing on the back of good monsoons. The recovery, however, is gradual and cannot alone compensate for the urban slump. High commodity inflation means that companies have no room to reduce prices to spur consumption. ""If consumers move from buying say a 1 kg pack of tea and multi-pack soaps to a 500 gram tea pack and one or two soaps, it will definitely impact quarterly volume growth of companies,"" an analyst said.Brands are focusing on maintaining the Rs 5, 10 and 20 price packs by taking reduction in grammage.

In 2024, central banks, particularly those from emerging markets, continued to be avid buyers of gold, to achieve a stable and secure asset combating global economic uncertainty.WCG’s report, ‘Central bank gold statistics November 2024’ stated, ""Assessing the final act of 2024, central banks around the world continued to play a leading role in the demand for gold. November represented another solid month of gold buying as central banks collectively added a net 53 tonnes to global official holdings.""The report suggests that the decline in gold prices following the US election may have encouraged some central banks to escalate their gold purchases in November.For India, the RBI’s additional 8 tonnes in November raised its total gold holdings to 876 tonnes. This brings the RBI’s year-to-date gold purchases to 73 tonnes, securing its position as the second-largest buyer of gold in 2024, behind Poland.Poland’s National Bank (NBP) emerged as the largest buyer in November, adding 21 tonnes to its reserves.

The bank added 5 tonnes in November, bringing its year-to-date net purchases to 34 tonnes and total holdings to 2,264 tonnes, or 5 per cent of its total reserves.Other countries also made significant gold purchases in November. The Central Bank of Jordan reported a 4-tonne rise in its reserves, the first monthly increase since July, bringing its year-to-date net purchases to nearly 2 tonnes and total holdings to 73 tonnes.Turkey’s central bank increased its gold reserves by 3 tonnes, while also engaging in reverse swap agreements (gold for lira) with domestic commercial banks to manage liquidity. The Czech National Bank added almost 2 tonnes in November, marking its 21st consecutive month of gold buying. Its year-to-date net purchases now total almost 20 tonnes, with total holdings exceeding 50 tonnes.The Bank of Ghana continued its domestic gold purchase programme, adding 1 tonne in November. This brings its year-to-date net purchases to 10 tonnes, lifting total gold holdings to 29 tonnes. The Bank of Ghana also launched the Ghana Gold Coin to the public in November, as part of efforts to stabilise the economy and promote investment in the country’s gold reserves.In contrast, the Monetary Authority of Singapore was the month’s largest seller, reducing its gold reserves by 5 tonnes.

The police cleared the protest site and conducted thorough vehicle checks around the area.Prashant Kishor, who launched his fast-unto-death on January 2, stood in solidarity with students demanding the cancellation of the BPSC examination over reported irregularities.Police officials transferred Kishor to an ambulance during his detention. Prior to this, he announced plans to submit a petition in the high court on January 7 concerning BPSC irregularities.Soon after Kishor's detention, a clash broke out between Patna Police and supporters of Jan Suraaj chief Prashant Kishor.""The police administration tried to break Prashant Kishore's fast by taking him from Gandhi Maidan to AIIMS.

In this cold weather, some are singing and you can see people from across the board sitting here. I am tired of answering accusations. Look around, and spot the vanity van if you can. We will sleep here too,"" he added.On Saturday, Tejashwi Yadav criticised the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) for exploiting the BPSC protest for political gains.He claimed that the student-led protest had been infiltrated by BJP supporters, claiming that the participants were effectively operating as an extension of the BJP.""It is being completely politicised. We feel that the people of Bihar will have to recognise these people who are the BJP's 'B' team and are trying to crush this independent movement. This is highly condemnable,"" he said.Regarding the controversy about Jan Suraaj chief Prashant Kishor's vanity van, Yadav said, ""An attempt was made to end the movement.

'Unrealistic scheduling': US Transportation department slaps $2 million penalty on JetBlue Airways,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/unrealistic-scheduling-us-transportation-department-slaps-a-2-million-penalty-on-jetblue-airways/articleshow/116923380.cms,"Settlement

Chronic delays



The US transportation department has imposed a $2 million penalty on JetBlue Airways for persistent delays on its east coast routes. Half of the fine would be distributed as compensation to affected passengers. This marks the first instance of an airline being fined for chronic delays on specific routes, which the department attributed to JetBlue’s “unrealistic scheduling,” the agency said.Transportation secretary Pete Buttigieg criticised the airline, stating, “Illegal chronic flight delays make flying unreliable for travelers. Today’s action puts the entire airline industry on notice that we expect their flight schedules to reflect reality.”JetBlue, however, shifted part of the blame onto the government’s air traffic control system .Spokesperson Derek Dombrowski said the airline had invested “tens of millions of dollars to reduce flight delays” caused by air traffic control challenges in key markets, including the Northeast and Florida which led to improved on-time performance in 2024, especially during peak summer travel.Dombrowski called the incoming Trump administration to modernise outdated air traffic control systems and address staffing shortages among controllers.The department identified chronic delays on JetBlue flights between June 2022 and November 2023. Problematic routes included flights from New York’s JFK Airport to Raleigh-Durham, Fort Lauderdale, and Orlando, as well as flights from Windsor Locks, Connecticut, to Fort Lauderdale.JetBlue has since agreed to a settlement over delays on four specific routes.“While we’ve reached a settlement to resolve this matter regarding four (routes) in 2022 and 2023, we believe accountability for reliable air travel equally lies with the US government, which operates our nation’s air traffic control system,” Dombrowski revealed.Under the regulations set by the transportation department, airlines must not publish unrealistic schedules, ensuring departure and arrival times reflect operational realities. A flight is deemed chronically delayed if it operates at least 10 times a month and arrives more than 30 minutes late in over half of those instances.","The US transportation department has imposed a $2 million penalty on JetBlue Airways for persistent delays on its east coast routes.

What Bloomberg strategists are saying...

While the notable absence of a Santa Rally has previously led to a rebound in stocks for the month of January, the year’s first trading day doesn’t offer a great signal for the whole 12-month period. Over the past four years, for example, it has actually been a contrarian indicator, Deutsche Bank notes. The S&P 500 ended the year inversely of how it started.

Extending that analysis back to 1928, the year’s first trading day and the SPX’s annual performance have a poor correlation and have only moved in tandem ~50% of the time.

Euro bludgeoned

Major US benchmarks extended a selloff for a fifth day, shaving more than a trillion dollars from share prices. A pair of deadly attacks compounded market angst, starting the first trading day of the year on a dour note.An early rally collapsed driving the Nasdaq 100 down more than 1%. The tech-heavy gauge and the S&P 500 clawed back losses to end Thursday down 0.2%. Tesla Inc.’s post-Christmas slump swelled to nearly 20% after its annual vehicle sales dropped, dragging on the indexes.Treasury yields steadied following a choppy session. The rate on the benchmark 10-year was nearly 20 basis points above the level prior to Jerome Powell’s hawkish turn at a Dec. 18 Federal Reserve meeting. Big moves have proliferated across asset classes after Powell’s board expressed waning enthusiasm for interest-rate cuts. The Cboe Volatility Index climbed for the fourth time in five days.Tesla sagged after the electronic vehicle-marker’s fourth-quarter deliveries missed estimates and annual sales dropped for the first time in over a decade. The stock registered its worst five-day drop in more than two years.For corporate earnings, 2025 will be a “show-me year,” according to Lisa Shalett at Morgan Stanley Wealth Management, who warned that the dominance of the Magnificent Seven — the big technology stocks responsible for the bulk of last year’s gains — was teetering. “This idea that they as a group can trade together and lead the market may falter in 2025,” she said. It’s a call echoed by others on Wall Street , including Bank of America Corp.’s Savita Subramanian.As for the grim slide in the final days of 2024, it’s “too soon to call it a bad omen,” Shalett told Bloomberg Television.Treasuries erased gains after a reading of weekly jobless claims fell to an eight-month low. A Bloomberg gauge of the dollar’s strength traded at a more than two-year peak.Goldman Sachs economists led by Jan Hatzius noted that “seasonal adjustment challenges can make jobless claims readings particularly volatile around the holiday season.”US stocks had been straining to snap a losing streak that took some shine off the S&P 500’s best two-year run dating back to the late 1990s. The index has surged more than 50% since the start of 2023, driven by gains in the tech megacaps amid enthusiasm about the boost to profits from artificial intelligence.An attack on revelers celebrating New Year’s in New Orleans thrust US domestic security back into the spotlight less than a month before Donald Trump is sworn in as president. The Federal Bureau of Investigation is probing that incident as well as the deadly explosion of a Tesla Cybertruck outside of Trump’s hotel in Las Vegas.A shooting overnight at a nightclub in New York City only added to the anxiety, while authorities said it wasn’t related to terrorism.CBOE’s gauge of Wall Street stock sentiment, the VIX, touched 19. Readings above 20 indicate mounting concern over near-term volatility.On Friday, investors will be watching the House speaker vote to see if Mike Johnson will retain his position. GOP squabbling over his reelection could bode ill for the president-elect’s agenda, according to Tom Essaye, founder of the Sevens report.If Johnson’s confirmation takes several rounds of voting over several days, “that will be a bad sign for Republican unity and hopes for quick action on pro-growth policies will take a hit,” he wrote.In the months to come, the growth outlook in Europe and China, the Federal Reserve’s policy path and Trump’s ability to execute on his campaign promises will be among the most pressing items on traders’ radars.European energy shares outperformed after a sharp increase in natural gas prices as the region braced for freezing winter temperatures without Russian supplies delivered via Ukraine. A transit contract between the two warring nations expired on New Year’s Day, with no alternative in place.The euro fell to the weakest against the dollar in over two years reflecting concerns about European growth, US trade tariffs and monetary policy divergence with the US. Many strategists are forecasting a slide to parity with the dollar or even lower this year.Euro Hits Weakest Level Versus US Dollar in Over Two YearsIn Asia, sentiment was subdued, with Chinese equities the worst performers as data pointed to a slowing economy and traders looked ahead to potentially higher tariffs. MSCI Inc.’s gauge of Asian shares fell for the third day out of the past four. Financial markets in Japan remained closed.Elsewhere in commodities, oil climbed after an industry report signaled US crude stockpiles continued to shrink.

The electric vehicle (EV) giant delivered 1.79 million vehicles in 2024, a slight decrease from the 1.81 million sold the previous year.A 2.3 per cent hike in fourth-quarter sales, reaching 495,570 vehicles, was insufficient to offset a sluggish start to the year, despite incentives like 0 per cent financing, free charging, and affordable lease options.This decline is primarily attributed to waning demand for electric vehicles in the US and other markets. Analysts suggest that many early adopters have already purchased EVs, while mainstream buyers remain cautious about factors such as driving range, price, and access to charging stations for longer trips.Tesla’s fourth-quarter sales also fell short of Wall Street estimates, with analysts expecting 498,000 deliveries. Production figures revealed similar challenges, with 459,445 vehicles produced in the quarter and 1.77 million for the year, both falling slightly below the year's total deliveries.Adding to Tesla's concerns, the average sales price of its vehicles is estimated to have dropped to just over $41,000 in the fourth quarter, the lowest in at least four years, according to analysts polled by FactSet. This pricing pressure, coupled with once-unheard-of discounts, has weighed on Tesla’s industry-leading profit margins.The dip in sales challenges Tesla’s 2022 prediction of 50 per cent annual growth, as the company faces an ageing model lineup and increased competition from legacy automakers and startups in China, Europe, and the US. Nearly all of Tesla's sales came from its smaller, more affordable Models 3 and Y, with just 23,640 deliveries of its higher-end Model X, Model S, and the new Cybertruck.Meanwhile, Chinese rival BYD is closing in on Tesla’s lead as the world’s top EV seller, reporting a 41 per cent increase in sales to 1.77 million EVs in 2024. Tesla narrowly maintained its edge, but the competition underscores the mounting pressure on the Austin, Texas-based company.Tesla shares dropped nearly 7 per cent on Thursday following the announcement. However, the stock remains up more than 50 per cent over the past year, driven partly by optimism surrounding Tesla’s advancements in AI-powered autonomous driving technology and the prospect of regulatory easing under Donald Trump's re-election.Industry analysts remain divided on Tesla’s outlook. Daniel Ives of Wedbush remains bullish, ""We have never viewed Tesla simply as a car company...instead we have always viewed Musk and Tesla as a leading disruptive technology global player,"" he said in a report, adding, ""and the first part of this grand strategic vision has taken shape.""William Stein, an analyst at Truist Securities, told news agency AP, that Tesla will struggle to sell vehicles in future months and expects further discounting used to boost sales will weigh on its financial results.Tesla’s fourth-quarter earnings report, scheduled for 29 January, will be closely watched by investors and analysts seeking clarity on how the company plans to navigate intensifying competition and demand challenges in the evolving EV market.","Tesla delivered 1.79 million vehicles in 2024, a slight decrease from the 1.81 million sold the previous year.

As we bid farewell to 2024 and step into 2025, the cryptocurrency landscape is reflecting on the remarkable trends and shifts that shaped the year. The market has been buzzing with discussions surrounding five standout cryptocurrencies: Solana (SOL), XRP, Cardano (ADA), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Rexas Finance (RXS). These tokens have captured attention due to their distinctive features, dynamic market movements, and promising growth potential. With the dawn of 2025, speculation is mounting about how these coins will fare in the upcoming market cycle and whether they will maintain their momentum or face new challenges.Solana continues to maintain a robust position in the market, trading at an average of $181.88 with a market cap of $87.2 billion. Its strong investor sentiment, coupled with a technical pattern signaling bullish momentum, has positioned it for further growth. Analysts forecast SOL to target a range between $156.33 and $211.22 by 2025, with the possibility of exceeding $264 if market confidence strengthens. This outlook is supported by Solana’s consistent performance and high transaction volumes, suggesting it remains a cornerstone for decentralized applications.XRP has emerged as one of the most discussed tokens of 2024. Despite losing nearly 20% from its December peak, it remains over 320% higher than its November low. On-chain data shows a significant rise in wallet activity, indicating strong community interest. Market analysts are optimistic about XRP’s potential, particularly as its charts display signs of a bullish resurgence. As institutional adoption increases, XRP is set to capitalize on its ledger's efficiency, reinforcing its relevance in cross-border transactions.Dogecoin’s price trajectory reflects a history of exponential growth during bullish cycles. Analysts note that DOGE has repeatedly surpassed key Fibonacci levels, and its ongoing symmetrical triangle pattern suggests a breakout may be imminent. With projections placing DOGE at $2.28 or higher, it could rank among the top three assets by market cap. The community-driven nature of DOGE continues to bolster its appeal, ensuring its position as a favorite in the crypto market.Cardano experienced a challenging year with a 9% weekly decline, but its price downtrend shows signs of stabilising. Whale activity has steadied, reducing selling pressure and pointing toward a consolidation phase. The $0.859 support level remains critical for ADA’s recovery, with potential to reclaim $1 in the coming months. Cardano’s innovative blockchain solutions and commitment to scalability make it a long-term contender, even amidst market fluctuations.Rexas Finance (RXS) has reshaped the crypto market through its focus on real-world asset (RWA) tokenisation. With RXS, investors can buy and trade fractional ownership of assets like real estate, gold, and collectibles. By bridging blockchain technology with tangible assets, Rexas Finance unlocks unprecedented opportunities for investors worldwide.

Chinese stocks tumble in worst start to a year since 2016,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/chinese-stocks-tumble-in-worst-start-to-a-year-since-2016/articleshow/116880502.cms,"Traders may want to limit China exposure in their portfolios as they position for 2025. (Representative picture)

Chinese stocks posted their worst start to a year in nearly a decade as investors braced for economic uncertainties with weaker-than-expected manufacturing data and an anticipated hike in tariffs.The CSI 300 Index closed down 2.9% on Thursday, its steepest drop on a year’s first day of trading since 2016. The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index slid as much as 3.1%.The losses suggest sentiment remains fragile even after Chinese equities posted their first annual advance last year since 2020. There’s a lack of confidence over the country’s economic recovery, with the Caixin manufacturing survey coming in below estimates and Donald Trump ’s threat of higher tariffs looming large ahead of his inauguration later this month.A sharp fall in the CSI 300 in the last trading session of 2024 also pushed the gauge below the 60-day moving average, a closely-watched technical threshold, likely leading to further selling by some funds. Several large financial stocks including Industrial and Commercial Bank of China and the Agricultural Bank of China traded ex-dividend, exacerbating the benchmarks’ losses.China Stocks Slump on Data, Support Level Breach“It’s a bit troubling that investors are starting the new year in a cautious mode as this is happening after clearer stimulus signals from Beijing during its December policy meetings,” said Homin Lee, senior macro strategist at Lombard Odier. “The underlying momentum for China remains quite fragile, and it will take some efforts from the authorities to change the conversation on the country’s medium-term deflationary dangers.”While Chinese stocks rose 15% last year in a rare annual gain, a bulk of the increase came in the weeks following a late September stimulus blitz. The market has since been trading range-bound, with investors waiting for more significant stimulus to drive the market higher.Following the Central Economic Work Conference in December, China signaled more public borrowing and spending in 2025 with a shift of policy focus to consumption, in an effort to repair the economy’s weak link as looming US tariffs threaten exports.While that announcement has given investors hope that Beijing is determined to revive the economy, some market watchers note that there will be a lull in stimulus until March when the so-called Two Sessions — China’s annual legislative session — take place.Traders may want to limit China exposure in their portfolios as they position for 2025, according to Charu Chanana, chief investment strategist at Saxo Markets.Global funds had already turned net sellers of Chinese stocks in November following two months of net inflows, Morgan Stanley analysts wrote in a note dated December 4. Passive funds turned to outflows after heavy inflows in October while active funds accelerated net outflows in November, they wrote.As economic concerns linger, China’s 10-year bond yields hit a fresh record low on Thursday. The People’s Bank of China injected massive liquidity into the market at the end of 2024 without using high-profile stimulus, as officials preserve policy space before Trump returns to office.Equity trading volume was notable in Hong Kong on Thursday as markets reopened after a holiday, with that for the Hang Seng Index 50% larger than the average over the past 30 sessions. Meanwhile, turnover in Shanghai and Shenzhen bourses has remained below 1.5 trillion yuan ($206 billion) in recent days, suggesting traders are opting to remain on the sidelines until catalysts become clear.“The losses today look very much trading driven, as there was a bit of accumulated gains that would have prompted selling with the breach of technicals,” said Liu Dejun, fund manager at Beijing Kaiyuan Private Fund Management Co. “Many are also talking about avoiding too much stock exposure ahead of Trump’s inauguration, which is close to the Lunar New Year holidays.”","The CSI 300 Index closed down 2.9% on Thursday, its steepest drop on a year’s first day of trading since 2016.

Shiba Inu is one of the trending meme coins, following a 24-hour increase of nearly 4%. While this may seem like a drop from the massive promises that SHIB holds, it’s crucial to note that the SHIB price is coming from a low point of -10.23% in the past month. Similarly, Stellar (XLM) has been on the road to rediscovery after a pause in its growth.However, the Lunex presale has been a success so far, raising over $5.6 million in a few months. The Lunex project has been attracting meme coin investors. Let’s find out why.The SHIB price has been down by about 11% in the past month, with a price of $0.000023 at the time of writing. The dip in the meme coin’s price comes after a massive decline hit the broader crypto market, causing pessimistic Shiba Inu news among investors.Nonetheless, SHIB investors can find solace in its cumulative 113% growth in the past 12 months and get confidence from the coin’s recent bounce back. The SHIB price has gone up by almost 4% in the last 24 hours alone. According to the latest Shiba Inu news, the recent turnaround is a result of the recent post by Elon Musk, which showed a SHIB-like creature hovering over a city.Another coin that has been regaining bullish trends after a period of decline is XLM. Following a year-to-date of over 200%, the XLM price has dropped by nearly 30% in the past month. The drop in the XLM price has caused uncertainty among investors, as there have been sharp price rises and falls.However, a 24-hour surge in the XLM price raises speculation that the token may be regaining momentum. The XLM price has surged by over 4% in the last 24 hours alone. The same applies to the coin’s market cap, which suggested that the Stellar break could be over. However, another sharp fall could be in the offing.While established altcoins like SHIB and XLM have been experiencing a mix of sharp uptrends and downtrends, new altcoins like Lunex have been growing steadily during their presales. For instance, the Lunex price has increased across various levels of its presale and is currently trading at $0.0049. The low Lunex price is a bargain for investors, who are driving the token’s growth in the altcoin market.The interest in the Lunex project stems from the various features that set it apart in the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. The cross-chain Web3 platform allows the seamless flow of assets across multiple blockchains and over 50,000 crypto pairs. Its non-custodial blockchain operations also make asset exchange faster, cheaper, and more efficient.Moreover, Lunex users can leverage its non-custodial crypto wallet , which helps traders store, manage, and trade over 40,000 digital assets within a single mobile app. Plus, Lunex token holders can earn passive income by staking their assets in the platform’s liquidity pool . With up to 18% APY up for grabs, the staking feature provides a rewarding investment opportunity. There’s also a Lunex reward program, which rewards traders with cashback offers on every transaction they complete on the cross-chain platform .","Shiba Inu is one of the trending meme coins, following a 24-hour increase of nearly 4%.

Xi Jinping: China’s 2024 GDP growth set to hit target of around 5%,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/xi-jinping-chinas-2024-gdp-growth-set-to-hit-target-of-around-5/articleshow/116835200.cms,"Xi signaled that support for the economy will continue into 2025.

Weak demand

Monetary easing

China’s gross domestic product is expected to expand around 5% for the full year of 2024, President Xi Jinping said, signaling the world’s second-largest economy is on track to meet its official target.China’s economy was “overall stable and progressing amid stability,” Xi said at a new year event on Tuesday, according to a speech published by the official Xinhua News Agency. Risks in key areas were effectively addressed, while employment and prices remained steady, he said.While a precise figure won’t be available until next month, the Chinese leader’s disclosure capped off a year of economic uncertainty, with the growth goal initially seen as a “target without a plan.” The outlook for 2024 improved after policymakers rolled out a slew of stimulus steps since late September, with economists now forecasting an expansion of 4.8% this year.Xi signaled that support for the economy will continue into 2025 during the New Year’s Eve remarks to the nation’s top political advisory body, reiterating a call to adopt more proactive macroeconomic policies.Later in the day in another new year address televised nationally, Xi acknowledged challenges facing China’s economy, including external uncertainties and shifting to new growth drivers, but called on the nation to remain confident in overcoming them.“In 2025, we will fully complete the 14th Five-Year Plan, implement more proactive and effective policies,” Xi said. “As always, we grow in wind and rain, and we get stronger through hard times. We must be full of confidence.”As in previous years, Xi also used his speech to reiterate the ruling Communist Party’s position on Taiwan. “No one can ever stop China’s reunification,” he said, alluding to Beijing’s longtime vow to bring the self-ruled island under its control, by force if necessary.China is expected to set a 2025 growth target roughly similar to this year’s, as top leaders signaled earlier this month they’re willing to embrace more forceful stimulus measures. That would help the economy counter any impact from potential increases in US tariffs after President-elect Donald Trump returns to the White House next month.An official GDP growth target would only be revealed in March, when annual legislative sessions are held. Chinese leaders plan to set an annual growth goal of about 5% for next year, Reuters reported earlier. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg estimate 4.5% growth in 2025.Officials at key meetings in December pledged to use greater public borrowing and spending as well as monetary easing to spur growth in 2025, in an unusually direct call that sought to boost confidence. They endorsed the first shift in monetary policy stance in 14 years to a “moderately loose” one.But the economy is still weighed by weak domestic demand and an uncertain outlook for exports, which has been a key growth driver this year. Deflation is likely to persist well into next year, while the property market is still slumping.Beijing’s initial stimulus next year is expected to fall short of the kind of radical action analysts believe is required to stem the downward spiral in prices, but officials may step up support later when growth falters just as they did this year.Previously, Premier Li Qiang also revealed the nation’s growth rate ahead of an official announcement by the statistics bureau in a step to lift sentiment. He said the economy grew 5.2% in 2023 in Davos last January, while highlighting the fact that China did not resort to massive stimulus.China’s next easing step could come from the People’s Bank of China, which has yet to provide a liquidity boost to markets by cutting the amount of cash banks must hold in reserves — a move it previously flagged as possible by the end of 2024.PBOC Governor Pan Gongsheng in October said the central bank may lower the reverse requirement ratio by 25 to 50 basis points depending on liquidity conditions by the year’s end. China’s top leaders at a key economic meeting in December also vowed to trim the RRR at an “appropriate time,” without providing more details.The PBOC’s decision likely took into consideration the need to stabilize the yuan. High-profile easing measures like a RRR cut could add to depreciation pressure on the yuan. That’s because it would worsen yuan assets’ yield disadvantage compared with dollar assets, triggering fund outflows. The yuan declined to its one-year low in December.The central bank likely withheld the RRR cut partly because the Federal Reserve signaled greater caution over how quickly it will lower interest rates, according to Bruce Pang, distinguished senior research fellow at the National Institution for Finance and Development, a think tank. The next window for a RRR cut could be after Trump takes office as US president on Jan. 20, he said.“The PBOC is preserving policy space to deal with increasing external uncertainties. Injecting too much liquidity could also make it harder to manage the yuan exchange rate and government bond yield,” he said.Liquidity in the interbank market remains ample for now, in spite of a seasonal rise in cash demand at the year-end period. The cost for top-rated commercial banks to raise funds from other institutions via one-year debt instruments hovered at the lowest since April 2020 at the end of December. Subdued loan demand may leave cash sitting idle in the banking system.PBOC is likely to lower the RRR in January before the Lunar New Year holiday — which begins Jan. 28 — if it doesn’t cut in December, according to analysts including Liu Yu at Huaxi Securities. Over the next year, the PBOC is expected to provide long-term liquidity by cutting the RRR and buying more government bonds.","China’s gross domestic product is expected to expand around 5% for the full year of 2024, President Xi Jinping said. The outlook for 2024 improved after policymakers rolled out a slew of stimulus steps since late September. But the economy is still weighed by weak domestic demand and an uncertain outlook for exports.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116835253,imgsize-20034,width-400,resizemode-4/116835253.jpg"

2024 becomes deadliest year in skies since 2018,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/2024-becomes-deadliest-year-in-skies-since-2018/articleshow/116809276.cms,"Commercial aviation has experienced its deadliest year since 2018 with 318 fatalities, including the Jeju Air disaster and the downing of an Azerbaijan Airlines plane. This reversal from 2023's record safety is marked by several tragic incidents, possibly exacerbated by global conflicts. Fatal aviation accidents, though rare, have surged this year.

Commercial aviation has suffered its deadliest year since 2018 after the Jeju Air disaster in South Korea and last week's downing of an Azerbaijan Airlines plane. Onboard passenger plane fatalities this year jumped to 318 with the two recent crashes, data compiled by Cirium shows. That's by far the highest death toll since more than 500 people died in 2018, a year marked by the first of two Boeing Co. 737 Max crashes. It marks a reversal from 2023 - the safest year ever in aviation with no deaths among large passenger jetliners. Fatal aviation accidents remain very rare.In Jan, a Japan Airlines jet collided with a coastguard plane at Tokyo airport. Everyone aboard the jetliner survived, but five people on the smaller aircraft were killed. In July, Nepal's Saurya Airlines crashed after taking off, killing 18. And in Aug dramatic footage of a plane operated by Brazilian airline VoePass captured its freefalling from the sky after encountering icy weather conditions. That accident killed 62. Global conflicts may also have contributed to this year's fatalities. The Azerbaijan Airlines jet had nearly completed a scheduled flight from the capital city of Baku to Grozny, Russia, on Dec. 25 when it was suddenly diverted across the Caspian Sea in Kazakhstan. Azerbaijan's prez has said the plane was accidentally shot down by Russia.","Onboard passenger plane fatalities this year jumped to 318 with the two recent crashes, data compiled by Cirium shows.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume.While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

Silver price hits record high! White metal crosses Rs 2.14 lakhs per kg — What's fuelling the rally?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/silver-price-hits-record-high-white-metal-crosses-rs-2-14-lakhs-per-kg-whats-fuelling-the-rally/articleshow/126117668.cms,"(Disclaimer: Recommendations and views on the stock market, other asset classes or personal finance management tips given by experts are their own.

Silver delivered a glittering rally on Monday, scaling a life time high, lifted by strong demand for the precious metal and global rally. Silver futures touched record high of Rs 2,14,534 per kilogram on the Multi-Commodity Exchange (MCX) in what is being seen as one of its strongest annual performances in recent years. Spot silver also gained 2.2% hitting a record high of $68.65 per ounce.With just two weeks remaining in 2025, market participants are closely tracking the momentum, as analysts increasingly see the Rs 2,25,000 level as a realistic target before the year ends.According to Jigar Trivedi, senior research analyst at Reliance Securities, the rally is being supported by “strong central bank buying and sustained ETF inflows”. He added that gold prices also rose to a record $4,380 per ounce on Monday, fuelled by expectations of further US interest rate cuts and rising geopolitical tensions, which have provided additional support to silver prices. Trivedi further told ET that the white metal could continue to gain on global cues and pegged the year-end target at Rs 2,25,000.Tata Mutual Fund, reffering to silver's momentum, said, “prices have surged to record highs in international markets, driven by a physical metal shortage, booming solar industry demand, strong Indian imports, and sustained inflows into silver ETFs”.The expert further told ET that supply disruptions are playing a major role behind the rally. The white metal recently received the designation of “critical mineral”, from the US. At the same time, China—one of the largest silver exporters—imposed export restrictions, further pressurising the global supply chain.Ponmudi R, CEO of Enrich Money, said that silver continues to outperform within the precious metals segment, noting that COMEX silver has also surged to register fresh all-time highs. “Silver’s strength is being driven by rising industrial demand from solar power, electric vehicles, and electronics, combined with persistent global supply deficits,” Ponmudi said.He added that investor participation has picked up, with silver offering leveraged exposure to the broader precious metals cycle.","Silver futures touched record high of Rs 2,14,534 per kilogram on the Multi- Commodity Exchange (MCX) Spot silver also gained 2.2% hitting a record highs of $68.65 per ounce.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126117632,imgsize-61114,width-400,resizemode-4/.jpg"

Zero Tariff Access For Indian Exports As Modi Govt Seals Landmark Free Trade Deal With New Zealand

India-New Zealand Free Trade Agreement: Top Points To Know

In a major boost for India, once the FTA is in place, Indian exports to New Zealand will get zero-duty access, with tariff elimination across all tariff lines. The pact is expected to benefit farmers, MSMEs, workers, artisans, women-led enterprises and youth, while creating new opportunities for labour-intensive sectors such as textiles, apparel, leather and footwear.

Manufacturing-oriented sectors including engineering, automobiles, electronics, machinery, plastics, pharmaceuticals and chemicals are also set to gain from the agreement, which aims to deepen trade and economic cooperation between the two countries.

The trade deal aims to expand cooperation in services, mobility, goods, investment and trade facilitation, with the aim of doubling bilateral trade over the next five years.

As part of the deal, New Zealand has committed to investing $20 billion in India over a 15 year period, following a framework similar to the European Free Trade Association model. The proposed investments are expected to target manufacturing, infrastructure, services, innovation and job creation, providing a significant boost to India’s investment landscape.

The agreement also places strong emphasis on agriculture. Indian farmers are expected to gain improved access to New Zealand’s market for products such as fruits, vegetables, coffee, spices, cereals and processed foods.

Through initiatives such as the Agricultural Productivity Partnership, Centres of Excellence and access to New Zealand’s advanced agricultural technologies, farmers are expected to benefit from higher productivity, improved quality and increased incomes. Targeted measures for horticultural products including honey, kiwifruit and apples are aimed at supporting sustainable growth in the sector.

At the same time, India has protected sensitive domestic sectors under the agreement. Agriculture and allied products including dairy, sugar, coffee, spices, edible oils, precious metals such as gold and silver, precious-metal scrap, copper cathodes and rubber-based products have been safeguarded to protect farmers, MSMEs and domestic industries.

The FTA opens new avenues for India’s services sector across areas such as information technology and IT-enabled services, finance, education, tourism and construction.

India-NZ trade details

A key pillar of the agreement is services and mobility. New Zealand has offered market access in 118 services sectors and sub sectors and extended Most Favoured Nation treatment in 139 services sectors. India, in turn, has granted New Zealand market access in 106 service sectors and MFN treatment in 45 sectors. The agreement also includes an annex on health and traditional medicine services to promote trade in these areas, marking the first time New Zealand has signed such an annex with any country.

Mobility provisions feature prominently in the pact. For the first time, New Zealand has signed an Annex on Student Mobility and Post Study Work Visas with another country. The arrangement places no numerical limits and guarantees Indian students the right to work 20 hours per week. Post study work visas have been provided for up to three years for graduates with bachelor’s degrees in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics, up to three years for master’s degree holders and up to four years for doctoral graduates.

The agreement also creates a new pathway for Temporary Employment Entry Visas, allowing up to 5,000 Indian professionals in skilled occupations to stay in New Zealand for a maximum period of three years. Eligible categories include AYUSH practitioners, yoga instructors, Indian chefs and music teachers, along with professionals from sectors such as information technology, engineering, healthcare, education and construction. In addition, a Working Holiday Visa arrangement will allow 1,000 young Indians to travel to New Zealand each year with multiple entries for a 12 month period.

On the goods front, India’s simple average MFN tariff of 16.2 percent will fall to 13.18 percent once the agreement comes into force, further reducing to 10.30 percent after five years and reaching 9.06 percent by the tenth year. Market access has been extended on 70.03 percent of tariff lines, while 29.97 percent have been excluded, largely covering sensitive sectors such as dairy, select animal and vegetable products, sugar, fats and oils, arms and ammunition, gems and jewellery, and copper and aluminium products.

India-New Zealand trade deal: Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his New Zealand counterpart Christopher Luxon on Monday had a telephonic conversation and announced finalising the India-New Zealand Free Trade Agreement (FTA). Both leaders stressed that this FTA would help enhance trade, investment, innovation, and shared opportunities between the two countries.Negotiations for the trade deal began during New Zealand Prime Minister Christopher Luxon’s visit to India in March 2025, with both sides positioning the pact as a major step towards deepening bilateral economic ties. The agreement is expected to significantly enhance economic engagement, improve market access, encourage investment flows and strengthen strategic cooperation between the two countries. It is also projected to create new opportunities for innovators, entrepreneurs, farmers, MSMEs, students and youth across a wide range of sectors.Christopher Luxon shared in a post on X, ""I've just spoken with India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi following the conclusion of the NZ-India Free Trade Agreement. The FTA reduces or removes tariffs on 95% of our exports to India. It's forecast that NZ exports to India could increase $1.1B to $1.3B per year over the coming two decades.Boosting trade means more Kiwi jobs, higher wages and more opportunities for hard working New Zealanders. The agreement builds on the strong friendship between our two countries. India is one of the fastest-growing economies in the world, and this gives Kiwi businesses access to 1.4 billion Indian consumers. Our Government is relentlessly focused on fixing the basics and building the future - with new trade deals like this helping to grow our economy so all Kiwis can get ahead.""In the fiscal year 2024-25, bilateral merchandise trade stood at $1.3 billion, while the total trade in goods and services was approximately $2.4 billion in 2024, with services trade alone accounting for $1.24 billion.","The trade deal aims to expand cooperation in services, mobility, goods, investment and trade facilitation.

"Gold price hits record high! Yellow metal jumps to $4,383.76 in early trade — What's driving the rally?",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/gold-prices-hit-record-high-yellow-metal-jumps-to-4383-76-in-early-trade-whats-driving-the-rally/articleshow/126112531.cms,"(Disclaimer: Recommendations and views on the asset classes given by experts are their own. These opinions do not represent the views of The Times of India)

Gold prices on Monday hit record high on expectations of more interest rate cuts by the US Fed and the yellow metal's status as the steady safe-haven amid weak dollar.Spot gold surged to $4,383.73 after fresh US economic data signalled continued weakness in the labour market, while easing inflation strengthened expectations of further monetary easing by the Federal Reserve. This took the yellow metal past its previous record high of $4,381.52, set in October. The Fed, delivered a quarter-point rate cut last week, fuelling hopes of more easing ahead. Investors are now expecting in two US rate cuts in 2026, a scenario that boosts the appeal of non-yielding assets such as gold.The precious metal, traditionally seen as a hedge in times of uncertainty, has risen 67% so far this year. The rally has been driven by persistent geopolitical and trade tensions, strong buying by central banks and expectations of lower interest rates next year. A softer dollar index has added further support by making gold cheaper for overseas buyers.The global momentum has also been reflected in domestic markets. Last week, MCX gold futures climbed Rs 574, or 0.43% to hit an all-time high of Rs 1,35,590 per 10 grams on Thursday. This marked the fourth consecutive weekly gain and puts gold on course for its twelfth straight monthly rise.Explaining the reason behind last week's rally, Prathamesh Mallya of Angel One said, “weak dollar, dovish federal reserve, lower inflation data in the US triggered the momentum in gold prices in the recent week.”While gold has posted strong gains, silver has outperformed the yellow metal. Last Friday, silver prices surged 8.08%, touching a record high of Rs 2,08,603 per kilogram. The white metal has climbed more than 130% this year, supported by strong exchange-traded fund inflows and concerns around yen carry trades amid expectations of a rate hike by the Bank of Japan.Looking ahead, market experts remain optimistic about both metals but have flagged the possibility of near-term corrections. Pranav Mer said silver could see further upside, though the risk-reward balance remains stretched.“We continue to maintain positive view in gold and expect prices to rise further to Rs 1,40,000-1,45,000 by early next year, with support for reversal placed at Rs 1,29,000 per 10 grams,” he said.","Spot gold surged to $4,383.73 after fresh US economic data signalled continued weakness in the labour market.

Nuvama has a reduce rating on Voltas with the target price at Rs 1,170. Analysts said that the company indicated that near-term demand remains weak due to elevated channel inventory (~45 days) and seasonally soft Nov–Dec demand. The company expects a sequential improvement in Q3FY26, partly aided by pre-buying by channel ahead of anticipated price increases given the cost inflation and change in rating table. Analysts cut Voltas’s FY26/FY27 earnings per share (EPS) by 12%/3% to reflect lower margin expectations.Kotak Institutional Equities has an add rating on SBI Cards with the target price at Rs 975. Analysts said that the company’s management said that its asset quality is likely to improve, led by a decline in the formation of special mention account and its flow rates; there is a recovery in spends and it would be able to defend its market share; loan growth would be gradual; and the cost-income ratio is likely at 55-57%.CLSA has an outperform rating on Dalmia Bharat with the target price at Rs 2,650. Analysts said that the company’s management highlighted an expected high-single-digit volume growth for Q3FY26, supported by sequential improvements in Nov and Dec following a prolonged monsoon. However, pricing remains weak, especially in the eastern region, declining by about 3-4% on a blended basis, which will likely impact margins for the quarter.The company reiterated its disciplined pricing approach, avoiding aggressive discounting to chase market share. On organic growth front, Jaisalmer greenfield expansion remains a key optionality, with limestone reserves acquired at a 20% premium, and land acquisition & clearances in an advanced stage.Morgan Stanley has an equal weight on HCL Technologies with the target price at Rs 1,680. Analysts said the company has announced another acquisition of assets carved out by HPE in telecoms services. However, analysts believe that the financial impact of the acquisition may not be significant for the company. Total cash consideration for the acquisition is $160 million (including incentives). The company has not disclosed financial details (revenues, margins) of the acquired assets.Citigroup maintained its buy rating on Divis Laboratories with the target price at Rs 9,140. Analysts said that the US Biosecure Act is likely to become a law after the Senate passed the NDAA and has now been sent to the White House for Presidential approval. Latest version does not name specific companies, unlike earlier drafts. However, the US Deputy Secretary of Defense earlier had flagged some China-based firms for possible inclusion under Section 1260H.

New Zealand to facilitate $20bn investment



NEW DELHI: India and New Zealand on Monday concluded a free trade agreement (FTA) that is expected to deepen economic ties between the two nations, with both countries vowing to double bilateral trade in the next five years.The FTA, the third to be sealed this year after the ones with UK and Oman, will give India tariff-free access to the island nation's markets. This is expected to enhance the competitiveness of India's labour-intensive sectors, including textiles, apparel, leather, footwear, marine products, gems and jewellery, handicrafts, engineering goods and automobiles, integrating them deeper into global value chains.Against the backdrop of prevalent geopolitical tensions, the latest trade deal also marks a key economic and strategic milestone in New Delhi's engagement in the Indo-Pacific region.India has offered market access to New Zealand in over 70% of tariff lines, covering 95% of bilateral trade value while excluding almost 30% of products. In addition, New Zealand has also promised to facilitate an investment of $20 billion over the next 15 years.“Concluded in just nine months, this historic milestone reflects a strong political will and shared ambition to deepen economic ties between the two nations,” PM Modi said on microblogging site X while announcing the deal with New Zealand’s PM Christopher Luxon.

Commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal vowed that India will never open up its diary sector in any FTA.“This FTA provides opportunities for all sections of our export community, opens up new doors for new exporters with new products wishing to diversify their export basket and at the same time helps every region of the country — north, south, east, west, northeast — in different areas,” said Goyal while addressing a news conference.“It has some very interesting new elements of technical collaboration in fruit products, fruit cultivation, in honey production and other areas including dairy, where they will bring the latest modern technology to India to help our farmers, our dairy persons increase incomes,” said Goyal.The FTA provides improved entry and stay provisions for Indian professionals, students and youth, including work opportunities during their study stints, post-study work pathways, dedicated visa arrangements and a working holiday visa framework.The FTA opens skilled employment pathways through a new temporary employment entry visa for Indian professionals in skilled occupations, with a quota of 5,000 visas at any given time and a stay of up to three years.

RBI spent $12 billion to not let Re breach 89 level in October,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/rbi-spent-12-billion-to-not-let-re-breach-89-level-in-october/articleshow/126128707.cms,"MUMBAI: RBI sold a net $11.9 billion in Oct 2025 to support the rupee, reinforcing its role as the stabilising force in the currency market. Data from RBI's Dec bulletin shows that the central bank stayed active across both spot and forward markets through FY25 to reduce volatility and keep market conditions orderly.In the spot, or OTC, market, the RBI sold more dollars than it bought to provide liquidity. Gross dollar purchases jumped sharply by 704% to $17.7 billion in Oct from $2.2 billion in Sept. At the same time, gross dollar sales rose 192% to $29.6 billion. This led to net dollar sales of $11.9 billion in Oct, a 50% increase from $7.9 billion in Sept, showing stronger intervention to counter pressure on the rupee. Taken together, RBI's cumulative net dollar sales in FY25 up to Oct stood at $34.5 billion, or Rs 2,91,233 crore at contract rates.Alongside spot market action, RBI relied more on forward contracts to influence future expectations without immediately using up reserves. By end-Oct, outstanding net forward sales increased 7.1% to $63.6 billion from $59.4 billion at end-Sept. This larger forward position acts as a buffer, reassuring markets that dollars will be supplied in the future if needed.In the exchange-traded currency futures market, RBI kept its net position neutral.In Oct, it bought and sold $2.3 billion each, resulting in no net purchase or sale. Even so, trading activity rose sharply, with total volumes up 73.5% from Sep. Outstanding net futures sales declined 9.8% to $1.4 billion by end-Oct.The data also suggest RBI was defending the rupee from dropping to 89 levels. The effective intervention price in Oct worked out to around Rs 88.25 per dollar, only slightly lower than Rs 88.35 in Sept, despite the large rise in the amount of dollars sold. This points to efforts to keep the rupee from weakening beyond the Rs 89 mark during a volatile period. For comparison, the average intervention rate for FY25 up to Oct was lower, at about Rs 84.39/$, reflecting the rupee's broader depreciation in late 2025 amid trade tensions and capital outflows.","RBI sold a net $11.9 billion in Oct 2025 to support the rupee, reinforcing its role as the stabilising force in the currency market.

Gold price prediction

today:

Gold prices could head to Rs 138,000 - Rs 140,000 with the right cues, says Manav Modi, Senior Analyst, Commodity Research at Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd. He shares his views and recommendations for gold investors and key levels to watch out for in the near term:

Stance: Buy on Dips

(Disclaimer: Recommendations and views on the stock market, other asset classes or personal finance management tips given by experts are their own. These opinions do not represent the views of The Times of India)

Gold and silver rebounded last week after sharp profit booking toward the end of the week before that, with silver breaking the psychological ₹2 lakh mark on the domestic front continuously marking all-time high, while gold also hit record highs hovering ~$4400 on Comex. Silver has surged over 120% YTD in 2025 and gold over 65%, making both among the best-performing assets of the year. Softer US Treasury yields and a weaker dollar index, lingering around 98, with volatility in USDINR supported prices continued to support domestic prices.Last week, amidst RBI Intervention USDINR fell by almost Rs 2. The Federal Reserve’s 25 bps rate cut in December meeting, delivered amid a divided vote, reinforced expectations of policy uncertainty, with officials offering mixed views on the future rate path. Recent US data showed rising unemployment, weaker-than-expected payroll additions for October and November, and mixed retail sales, keeping pressure on yields and the dollar.Silver backwardation widened again, signalling supply tightness and strong speculative interest, while gold faced mild demand headwinds in India due to record prices despite the wedding season. Globally, safe-haven demand remained intact amid geopolitical risks and policy uncertainty.Markets now await key triggers including US housing numbers, GDP, PCE price index, consumer confidence, durable goods orders data. We are heading towards holiday shortened days as well amidst the Christmas holiday so volatility could also get thin.With support of Rs. 132,000 prices could target towards 138,000-140,000.

Mercedes-Benz agrees to pay $149.6 million to settle multistate emissions allegations,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/mercedes-benz-agrees-to-pay-149-6-million-to-settle-multistate-emissions-allegations/articleshow/126132067.cms,"FILE - The company logo is shown on the grille of an unsold 2026 AMG S63 Performance model on the lot of a Mercedes Benz dealership Nov. 2, 2025, in Littleton, Colo. (AP Photo/David Zalubowski, File)

Mercedes-Benz USA and parent company Daimer AG have agreed to pay $149.6 million to settle allegations that the automaker secretly installed devices in hundreds of thousands of vehicles to pass emission tests, a coalition of attorneys general announced Monday.According to the coalition, between 2008 and 2016 the German automaker equipped more than 211,000 diesel passenger cars and vans with software devices that optimized emission controls during tests but reduced the controls during normal operations. The devices enabled vehicles to far exceed legal limits for nitrogen oxides, a pollutant that can cause respiratory illnesses and contributes to smog.The states alleged that Mercedes installed the devices because it couldn't reach design and performance goals such as fuel efficiency while complying with emissions standards. The automaker allegedly concealed the devices from state and federal regulators and the public while marketing the vehicles as ""environmentally friendly"" and compliant with emissions standards.The agreement is still subject to court approval. Daimler AG and Mercedes-Benz USA already agreed in 2020 to pay $1.5 billion to the US government and California state regulators to resolve the emissions cheating allegations.Mercedes-Benz issued a statement saying the deal announced Monday will resolve all remaining legal proceedings tied to diesel emissions in the United States, but the company still considers the accusations unfounded and denies any liability. The automaker has made ""sufficient provisions"" for the cost of the settlement, the statement said.Fifty attorneys general, including the attorneys general of the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, made up the coalition announced Monday. California was not part of the group.The settlement calls for the automaker to pay the attorneys general $120 million with another $29 million payment suspended and potentially waived pending completion of a consumer relief program.That effort will extend to the roughly 40,000 vehicles with the devices that hadn't been repaired or permanently removed from the road by Aug. 1, 2023. The owners of those vehicles would get $2,000 per vehicle if they install approved emissions modification software and an extended warranty.The settlement also calls for Mercedes to comply with reporting requirements and refrain from any further unfair or deceptive marketing or sale of diesel vehicles.Volkswagen also ended up paying $2.8 billion to settle a criminal case due to emissions cheating.","Mercedes-Benz USA and parent company Daimer AG have agreed to pay $149.6 million to settle allegations that the automaker secretly installed devices in hundreds of thousands of vehicles.

Father’s guarantee: Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison backstops son’s $78bn Paramount bid for Warner Bros. Discovery,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/fathers-guarantee-oracle-co-founder-larry-ellison-backstops-sons-78bn-paramount-bid-for-warner-bros-discovery/articleshow/126131030.cms,"Larry Ellison steps in to silence Warner Bros’ funding doubts



Paramount versus Netflix



A hostile bid raises the pressure



What happens next

Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison has stepped in to personally guarantee more than $40bn in financing for Paramount Skydance’s hostile $78bn bid for Warner Bros. Discovery. The move follows open scepticism from WBD’s board over whether the offer was fully funded and capable of closing. By putting his own wealth on the line, Ellison aims to remove those doubts while reinforcing the high-stakes family dynamic behind the takeover led by his son, David Ellison WBD’s board has repeatedly argued that Paramount’s offer relied too heavily on external investors and lacked certainty of financing. In takeover situations, boards are legally required to assess not just the headline price but the likelihood that a deal will actually close. WBD described the original funding structure as unreliable, giving it grounds to favour a rival proposal with clearer financial backing.Larry Ellison’s guarantee covers $40.4bn of the equity financing, effectively backstopping the transaction if other investors fall short. Paramount has also agreed to greater transparency around the Ellison family trust and confirmed the Oracle shareholdings underpinning the financing.Together, these steps are intended to neutralise WBD’s claims that the bid’s funding was uncertain.Paramount is offering $30 per share for the entire company, including cable assets such as CNN. That contrasts with an $83bn agreement between WBD and Netflix, which offers a lower per-share price of about $27.75 but excludes WBD’s cable networks, which would be spun off. WBD maintains that the Netflix deal delivers greater overall value once those assets are separated.Because Paramount’s approach is hostile, it bypasses WBD management and appeals directly to shareholders. To further strengthen its hand, Paramount has increased its break-up fee to $5.8bn, matching the penalty Netflix would pay if its deal collapsed. The changes are designed to make it harder for WBD’s board to dismiss the bid on financing grounds alone.While family guarantees are common in private business, they are rare at this scale. Larry Ellison, one of the world’s richest individuals, is effectively vouching for his son’s strategy by placing his personal fortune behind the deal. The move signals just how determined Paramount is to force serious engagement from WBD’s board and shareholders.WBD’s board is expected to formally respond to the revised offer. Even if directors remain opposed, the strengthened financing could encourage shareholders to challenge the board’s recommendation. Markets reacted positively to the escalation, with WBD shares rising as investors weighed the increased likelihood of a bidding showdown.Whether the personal guarantee is enough to overturn board resistance remains uncertain. What is clear is that Paramount has now gone all in, turning the takeover battle into a test of funding certainty, shareholder confidence and the power of a father’s guarantee.","Larry Ellison’s guarantee covers $40.4bn of the equity financing, effectively backstopping the transaction if other investors fall short.

FedEx questioned for hiring hundreds of H-1B workers while firing US staff after $2.24 billion federal contract: 'Our strategy is...',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/fedex-questioned-for-hiring-hundreds-of-h-1b-workers-while-firing-us-staff-after-2-24-billion-federal-contract-our-strategy-is-/articleshow/126128648.cms,"American company FedEx has come under fire after a multibillion-dollar federal delivery contract coincided with a sharp increase in the company’s hiring of foreign workers, even as it cut hundreds of US jobs across multiple states.In December 2022, the US Transportation Command awarded FedEx a contract worth $2.24 billion for the Next Generation Delivery Service-2 programme. The base period runs from April 2023 to September 2026, with options that could extend the work through 2030.According to the Dallas Express, data shows that at the time of the contract award, FedEx had roughly two dozen approved H-1B visa workers. By 2025, that number had risen to about 500. Some of the visa positions were listed with salaries ranging from $100,000 and $115,000.However, the surge in foreign hiring occurred alongside layoffs of US employees. In November 2025, FedEx announced plans to eliminate 856 jobs at one of its warehouses. Earlier in the year, 305 positions were cut in Fort Worth and 131 more in Garland and Plano. Across the country, layoffs also hit Memphis, Kentucky, New York, and Pennsylvania.A company spokesperson told Dallas Express: “FedEx is committed to offering employees the opportunity to grow and advance in their careers. Doing so helps our team members thrive, and FedEx prosper. Our strategy is centred around recruiting a skilled workforce that meets our unique business needs and hiring the most qualified candidates.”Sources familiar with the company said much of the H-1B growth is because of corporate entities joining hands and does not have any direct relation to the eliminated positions, which are not roles eligible for H-1B visas.H-1B visas are typically reserved for jobs requiring a bachelor’s degree or higher, but the program has become a political flashpoint recently.US vice president JD Vance urged companies: “You Might Try Hiring Americans.”Meanwhile, most MAGA commentators and GOP supporters want a total ban on the H-1B system, saying that the program steals jobs and opportunities from native Americans and hands them cheaply to immigrant workers. Most workers coming on H-1B are ready to work for lower salaries than US labour, automatically making them a more efficient option for American employers. However, right-wing media cited how American employees were forced to train their foreign replacements before getting the boot.Business leaders such as ex-DOGE lead Vivek Ramaswamy and Tesla CEO Elon Musk have said foreign labour is necessary and that America needs that global talent to run its crucial tech and IT sectors.FedEx said that it complies with all laws and employs a variety of workers irrespective of their ethnicity. “Across our business, we employ a wide range of roles, requiring a variety of skillsets and are committed to complying with all applicable federal immigration laws,” the spokesperson said. The company has not directly linked its federal contract to its H-1B hiring or domestic layoffs.","In December 2022, the US Transportation Command awarded FedEx a contract worth $2.24 billion for the Next Generation Delivery Service-2 programme.

China on Monday announced imposing provisional anti-subsidy duties on dairy products imported from the European Union, after concluding that the inflow of these goods has harmed its domestic dairy sector.The Chinese commerce ministry, cited by Reuters, said that the duties are set between 21.9% and 42.7% and will be effective from December 23. The announcement comes after an investigation which was launched more than a year ago.According to preliminary findings, dairy products originating in the EU were found to have received subsidies that caused significant damage to Chinese producers.The move comes at a time when the two countries' already have strained trade relations, since 2023, when the European Commission initiated an anti-subsidy probe into electric vehicles manufactured in China. Beijing subsequently opened its own investigations into EU imports of brandy, pork and dairy products, actions that were seen as a response to Europe’s scrutiny of Chinese EVs.Among individual companies, Italy’s Sterilgarda Alimenti SpA will be subject to the lowest duty rate of 21.9%. The highest rate of 42.7% will apply to FrieslandCampina Belgium NV and FrieslandCampina Nederland BV, the commerce ministry said.EU firms that did not take part in the investigation will also face the top levy, Reuters reported.The ministry added that 12 French companies will be charged duties of 29.7%, while roughly 50 other firms from Italy, France and Germany will be subject to a rate of 28.6%.China is a major market for European dairy exporters. Customs data, cited by Reuters shows that the EU is China’s second-largest supplier of dairy products, behind New Zealand. EU figures from 2023 indicate that China ranked as the second-largest destination for skimmed milk powder exports, and the fourth-largest market for butter and whole milk powder.Responding to concerns over trade remedies, an official from the commerce ministry’s trade remedy department said China has exercised caution in deploying such measures.The official noted that no new trade remedy investigations targeting the EU have been launched this year, with final rulings issued only in three anti-dumping cases involving brandy, copolymerised polyformaldehyde and pork.""China’s position against the abuse of trade remedy measures remains unchanged, and we are willing to work with the EU through dialogue and consultation to properly handle trade frictions and jointly safeguard the overall China-EU economic and trade cooperation,"" the official told Reuters.",China imposes provisional anti-subsidy duties on dairy products imported from the European Union.

Angry French Farmers Protest Cattle Culls & EU-Mercosur Deal, Disrupt Roads and Government

Brazil's President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva said on Saturday he hopes the massive free-trade deal between South American bloc Mercosur and the European Union will be signed in January. Protests on Friday by European farmers and opposition from France and Italy threatened to quash an agreement that has been under negotiation for more than 26 years.Top EU officials had hoped to sign the EU-Mercosur deal in Brazil this weekend, but instead, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said Friday after a tense EU summit that the signature will be delayed ''a few extra weeks to address some issues with member states.''Lula told other South American leaders attending a summit in the Brazilian city of Foz do Iguacu, on the three-way border with fellow Mercosur members Argentina and Paraguay, that the meeting was only taking place because European negotiators had earlier signaled they would eventually sign the deal, and that did not happen. He added the delay was due to Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni requesting more time.Von der Leyen needs the backing of at least two-thirds of EU nations to secure the deal. Italy's opposition would give France enough votes to veto von der Leyen's signature.""Without political will and courage from leaders, it won't be possible to finish a negotiation that has dragged for 26 years,"" Lula, who spoke to Meloni on the phone on Friday and received a letter from EU leadership aiming for a deal in January, told his peers.""Meanwhile, Mercosur will continue to work with other partners.""""The world is eager to make deals with Mercosur,"" the Brazilian president added.

'Don’t travel’: Google and Apple warn visa workers against overseas travel amid US immigration crackdown,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/dont-travel-google-and-apple-warn-visa-workers-against-overseas-travel-amid-us-immigration-crackdown/articleshow/126100671.cms,"Google and Apple advised US-based employees on work visas not to travel internationally after their outside counsel warned of delays of up to 12 months at US embassies and consulates worldwide amid the immigration crackdown, documents reviewed by Business Insider show.On Thursday, BAL Immigration Law, which represents Google, sent a memo stating, “Please be aware that some US Embassies and Consulates are experiencing significant visa stamping appointment delays, currently reported as up to 12 months.” It added that employees would “risk an extended stay outside the US” if they travelled without a valid stamp.Last week Fragomen, acting for Apple, issued a similar warning. “Given the recent updates and the possibility of unpredictable, extended delays when returning to the US, we strongly recommend that employees without a valid H-1B visa stamp avoid international travel for now,” the memo said. “If travel cannot be postponed, employees should connect with Apple Immigration and Fragomen in advance to discuss the risks. ”American consulates and embassies around the world have reported routine visa appointment delays since the introduction of a new social media screening requirement, which applies to H-1B visa workers and their dependents, as well as students and exchange visitors. A Department of State spokesperson told Business Insider on Friday that it was conducting “online presence reviews for applicants.”The spokesperson said appointments may be moved as resources change, and applicants can request expedited slots on a case-by-case basis.“While in the past the emphasis may have been on processing cases quickly and reducing wait times, our embassies and consulates around the world, including in India, are now prioritizing thoroughly vetting each visa case above all else,” the spokesperson added. Immigration firm Reddy Neumann Brown PC reported that appointments in Ireland and Vietnam had also been postponed.Google’s memo noted that H-1B, H-4, F, J and M visa stamping was affected. Neither company’s advisory addressed how individuals already abroad with postponed appointments should proceed. A Google spokesperson declined to comment. Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.A Department of State spokesperson emphasised that consular officers “do not issue a visa unless the applicant can credibly demonstrate they meet all requirements under US law — including that they intend to engage only in activities consistent with the terms of their visa.”The H-1B programme, capped at 85,000 new visas a year, serves as a key pipeline for employers hiring skilled foreign workers. Under the Trump administration the programme became a political flashpoint, with critics and some employers arguing that new policies—including a Rs 83 lakh fee on new H-1B visas (approx)—have made it harder and more expensive to hire overseas talent.During the 2024 govt fiscal year Alphabet, Google’s parent company, applied for 5,537 H-1B visas, while Apple applied for 3,880, according to Business Insider’s analysis of Department of Labor and US Citizenship and Immigration Services data.",Google and Apple advised US-based employees on work visas not to travel internationally.

"US labour market: After affordability concerns, America faces its next hurdle — a ‘stagnating’ job landscape",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-labour-market-after-affordability-concerns-america-faces-its-next-hurdle-a-stagnating-job-landscape/articleshow/126100613.cms,"The US labour market continues to lose steam, with the latest jobs report showing a sharp slowdown in hiring. While November’s data was affected by shutdown-related distortions, economists say the broader trend is clear: job creation has settled into a prolonged low gear.Though employers are still adding workers, the pace of hiring is among the weakest recorded in the past two decades. The unemployment rate ticked higher, driven in part by more Americans entering the workforce without finding jobs. At the same time, long-term unemployment increased, the number of discouraged workers grew, and economic gaps widened further, CNN reported.“Hiring, while certainly not on a freeze, is on hold; and people that have jobs are absolutely holding on to them with white knuckles,” said Dan North, Allianz Trade’s senior economist for North America.“I see that as definitely a labor market that’s stagnating,” North further told CNN.Despite the slowdown in hiring, the broader US economy has not slipped into contraction. Economic growth remains steady and productivity levels have held up. Average monthly job gains stand at roughly 55,000, a figure that reflects heightened uncertainty around trade policy, immigration rules and the broader political environment.Joe Brusuelas, chief economist at RSM US, told CNN that structural changes in the workforce are also reshaping employment dynamics. As Baby Boomers retire and immigration faces additional restrictions, the overall supply of labour is shrinking. As a result, the economy no longer needs to generate as many jobs each month to remain stable.“My estimate is that we need to hire 50,000 a month to keep the labor market conditions stable,” Brusuelas told CNN. Under such conditions, economic growth could remain close to 2%, financial conditions would stay supportive, and inflation pressures may ease somewhat.From a purely economic standpoint, Brusuelas said, this scenario is sustainable and could persist for years. However, he warned that the benefits of stability would not be evenly shared. In a K-shaped economy, higher-income households are likely to continue benefiting from growth, while lower-income groups face increasing strain as hiring slows.Looking ahead, economists see multiple forces that could push the labour market in different directions. One major unknown is artificial intelligence and how quickly it might alter employment patterns. In the short term, uncertainty around AI adoption is making companies cautious about expanding their workforce, according to economists at Pantheon Macroeconomics, cited by CNN.“The longer-term implications for labor displacement and wage dynamics, however, remain an open question,” Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management, wrote in a note this week.AI, combined with tougher immigration enforcement and unresolved policy questions, is acting as a drag on labour market growth, said Tyler Schipper, associate professor of economics at St. Thomas University in Minnesota.“The question I ask myself is, ‘ What would be the conditions in which I think the labor market would ramp back up?’ and some of those are policy-related,” he said. “I have a hard time seeing those resolving themselves anytime soon.”“For better or worse, I think we could be in this K-shaped economy for some time,” Schipper added. “And I think the way out of it probably is that there’s a recession before things get better, which is never what you want to hear if you’re on the lower leg of the K.”Others believe the slowdown may not be permanent. Cory Stahle, an economist at Indeed Hiring Lab, said hiring could eventually accelerate, though the process is likely to be slow.“The US labor market is like a pretty big ship turned by a rudder,” he told CNN. “Sometimes it takes a little time to turn around.”Recent interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve could help stimulate hiring, though their impact typically takes three to five quarters to filter through the economy. Reduced uncertainty, whether through policy clarity or economic stability, could also encourage employers to loosen their grip on hiring plans.For now, uncertainty remains a dominant force. Businesses continue to grapple with unanswered questions around interest rates, prices, government policy and the tax law set to take effect in the upcoming year, Brusuelas noted.","The US labour market continues to lose steam, with the latest jobs report showing a sharp slowdown in hiring.

EU-Mercosur trade deal: Lula eyes January signing; EU farmer protests and member pushback delay pact,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/eu-mercosur-trade-deal-lula-eyes-january-signing-eu-farmer-protests-and-member-pushback-delay-pact/articleshow/126096259.cms,"Photo- AP

Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva said on Saturday that he hopes the long-pending free-trade agreement between Mercosur and the European Union will be signed in January, even as opposition from some EU members and protests by European farmers delay the deal, AP reported.Speaking at a summit of South American leaders in Foz do Iguacu, on Brazil’s border with Argentina and Paraguay, Lula said European negotiators had earlier indicated the agreement would be signed this weekend, prompting the meeting. That did not happen, he said, after Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni asked for more time.Top EU officials had been aiming to finalise the EU-Mercosur deal in Brazil, but European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said on Friday, following a tense EU summit, that the signing would be postponed by “a few extra weeks” to address concerns raised by member states.Lula said he spoke to Meloni by phone on Friday and received a letter from EU leadership indicating an intention to conclude the agreement in January. He added that the delay underscored the lack of political resolve to finish talks that have stretched over more than 26 years.“Without political will and courage from leaders, it won’t be possible to finish a negotiation that has dragged for 26 years,” Lula told fellow leaders.“Meanwhile, Mercosur will continue to work with other partners.”Von der Leyen needs the backing of at least two-thirds of EU member states to secure the deal. Italy’s opposition would allow France to marshal enough votes to block her from signing it.“The world is eager to make deals with Mercosur,” Lula said. “Many countries want that. And we certainly will be able to finish the deals that were not finished during my presidency [of the bloc, which ends in December].”If concluded, the agreement would create a market of about 780 million people, covering roughly a quarter of global gross domestic product, and would gradually remove duties on most goods traded between the two blocs.France has led resistance to the pact involving the EU and the five active Mercosur members — Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay and Bolivia.

Big Tech's $70 Billion AI Move: Silicon Valley Bets On India, Snubs Trump's 'America First' Diktat

AI now dominates US economic growth

Productivity gains remain uncertain

‘The most hated tech revolution’

What Went Wrong with Capitalism,

Bubble signals are flashing

Interest rates are the real trigger

Global markets rotate away from the US

China’s private sector pivot

Government power and tariffs

Quality stocks offer a contrarian opportunity

The global economy has entered a phase where artificial intelligence has become the dominant force shaping growth, markets and policy, with the US now the most exposed to both its promise and its risks, according to economist and investor Ruchir Sharma.“This big factor has out-Trumped Trump – AI,” Sharma said in a conversation with Nicolai Tangen, earlier on December first week, arguing that artificial intelligence has now become “the singular focus of the global economy and particularly the US economy”.Ruchir Sharma, chairman of Rockefeller International and founder and chief investment officer of Breakout Capital, is a veteran global investor and economic commentator.“The US economy has now become one big bet on AI,” he said. “Outside of AI, there’s a lot of weakness in the US economy. But AI has continued to drive everything.”Sharma warned that the scale of this concentration leaves little margin for error. “This big bet on AI better works out for America,” he said. “Because if it doesn’t work out, then I think that there’s a lot of trouble for this country ahead.”Veteran analyst pointed to the growing contribution of AI-linked capital expenditure to US growth.“The measures currently show that about 40% of economic growth in America this year has come from capex spending towards AI,” he said.Beyond investment, he stressed the importance of the wealth effect. “The stock market doing well, the financial assets doing well — that is clearly powering the spending of the top 10% in this country,” Sharma said. “And the top 10% is what’s driving the entire consumer spending.”He added that market gains themselves are heavily concentrated. “About 80% of the gains in the stock market this year have been powered by AI plays,” he said.“By some measures, you can argue that about 60% of economic growth in America today is being driven by AI.”Despite the scale of investment, Sharma said it is still too early to see decisive productivity gains from AI. “AI adoption is still in its nascent stage,” he said. “So far, it’s too early.”Asked how much of recent productivity improvement can be attributed to AI, Sharma replied, “Very little as yet.”Drawing a comparison with the internet boom, he said, “If you look back at the internet revolution in the late 1990s, the big bump in productivity really happened later. It takes a while for these benefits to come through.”He also said there is still uncertainty about how AI will ultimately be used. “We don’t even know as yet what exactly AI is going to end up doing,” Sharma said.The author ofRuchir Sharma argued that AI differs from past technological revolutions because of widespread fear rather than optimism.“This is the most hated tech revolution,” he said. “If you look back at the other big revolutions, people were very optimistic about what it would bring.”By contrast, Sharma said surveys show deep anxiety. “Only about 35% of people are feeling good about AI,” he said. “Most people want this to be regulated because they’re fearful about the impact.”“One, all the techno-optimists are telling them, ‘We’re coming for your job.’ And second is just fear — people don’t know how to use these tools,” he added.While calling AI a “good bubble”, Sharma said the market displays multiple warning signs.“I look at the four O’s,” he said — “overinvestment, overvaluation, overownership and overleverage.” On investment, he said, “Tech investment as a share of GDP is about 5% today. That’s roughly what we saw back in 2000.”On valuations, Sharma said, “By any stretch, the US stock market — and of course the AI plays — are overvalued.” While price-to-earnings ratios may not match dotcom levels, he said, “If you look at price to free cash flow or very long-term earnings, by those measures we are getting there.”Overownership is also visible. “Americans have about 52% of their financial wealth in equities today,” Sharma said. “That is higher than what it was even in 2000.”On leverage, he said conditions are changing fast. “The biggest issuers of debt in the last few months have been companies like Meta, Amazon and even Microsoft,” Sharma said, as firms rush to stay ahead in the AI arms race.Sharma said bubbles rarely burst because of technology disappointment alone.“Every single bubble or mania in history has been pricked by just one factor — when interest rates finally go up,” he said.He expressed concern about the Federal Reserve’s policy stance. “Inflation is already quite sticky,” Sharma said. “The Fed’s 2% target is nowhere in sight. The Fed has missed its 2% target for five years in a row.”“The fact that the Fed is cutting interest rates in this environment is completely bewildering to me,” he added.If inflation accelerates or rates rise, Sharma warned, “That’s when this entire overinvestment AI bubble will burst.”Sharma said one of the biggest surprises this year has been the underperformance of US markets relative to Europe, emerging markets and China.“At the beginning of the year, everyone was onto the American exceptionalism trade,” he said. “Instead, Europe, emerging markets and China have outperformed America.”He said extreme positioning played a role. “America’s weight in global equity indices was hitting nearly 70%,” Sharma said.But reforms also mattered. “In Europe, expectations were very low, but at least countries like Germany began to wake up and say, ‘We need to do something here’,” he said.Sharma said China’s market rebound reflects necessity rather than ideology.“The economy in China is in big trouble outside of AI,” he said. “The property market is bust.”He said Beijing realised that competing with the US on AI required a shift. “There was a very important pivot,” Sharma said. “China realised that if we have to compete with America on AI, we need to back the private sector again.”“Jack Ma is back at Alibaba,” he noted, adding that the stock has doubled this year.Sharma said the expanding role of the state continues to distort capitalism.“The asymmetry remains,” he said. “On the upside, you capitalise the gains. On the downside, the risks are socialised.”On tariffs, he said, “There’s no objectivity or science behind it. It’s very arbitrary.”While tariffs have helped revenues — cutting the US deficit by about 1% of GDP — Sharma said, “Tariffs have had a negative effect on economic growth. It’s just been offset by the optimism around AI.”Looking ahead, Sharma highlighted quality stocks as a neglected opportunity.“The last 12 months have been one of the worst runs that quality stocks have had in recorded history,” he said.“There has never been a better time to buy quality stocks,” Sharma added, referring to companies with high returns on equity, low leverage and strong cash flows.He also expects global markets to continue outperforming the US. “These tend to be multi-year trends once they begin,” he said.While he declined to predict exact timing, Sharma offered a clear signal to watch: “At the slightest sign that interest rates are going to go up — that’s when you know this is done.”","Ruchir Sharma, chairman of Rockefeller International and founder and chief investment officer of Breakout Capital, is a veteran global investor and economic commentator. “This big factor has out-Trumped Trump – AI,” Sharma said in a conversation with Nicolai Tangen, earlier on December first week.

Plaintiffs in the first lawsuit against the $100K entry-fee for H-1B workers approach court to seek urgent relief,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/plaintiffs-in-the-first-lawsuit-against-the-100k-entry-fee-for-h-1b-workers-approach-court-to-seek-urgent-relief/articleshow/126090420.cms,".

Trump's H-1B Visa Chaos: Jobs At Risk, Families Traumatised As Wait Pushed To Late 2026

A coalition of US healthcare providers, educational institutions and employers have moved to court seeking urgent relief from the Trump administration’s controversial $100,000 entry-fee for H-1B workers, which was announced on Sept 19, via a proclamation. They have sought an immediate block on its enforcement and nationwide protection for affected employers.In two new filings before the US District Court for the Northern District of California, the plaintiffs have sought a preliminary injunction to pause the fee while the case is heard, and certification of a nationwide class to ensure that any relief granted applies uniformly across the country. The filings argue that the six-figure entry-fee imposed through a presidential proclamation is unlawful, arbitrary and beyond the executive’s authority, and is already disrupting medical care, education and local economies.The legal challenge follows an earlier lawsuit filed by these plaintiffs on Oct 3 (duly reported by TOI), which questioned the Trump administration’s decision to bypass Congress and impose an unprecedented and unauthorised cost on the H-1B visa programme.Soon after this coalition led by Global Nurse Force filed the lawsuit (it was the first to challenge the entry fee), the Trump administration issued a new guidance seemingly backtracking on one of the proclamations' most extreme provisions.It now stated that the fee may not apply to certain individuals already in the US who are in the process of changing their immigration status. For instance, the fee would not apply in case of an F-1 student who has transitioned to an H-1B visa ‘while’ in the US. However, the coalition points out that the fee remains in effect in many circumstances, harming students, workers, and employers in America.The new court filings seek to immediately halt enforcement of the fee, which applies to employers hiring doctors, nurses, teachers, engineers, researchers and other highly skilled professionals, regardless of their size or public-service role.The plaintiffs are represented by several advocacy groups, including Democracy Forward and the South Asian American Justice Collaborative (SAAJCO); and IMMpact litigation (a joint venture of four law firms).Kalpana V. Peddibhotla, executive director, SAAJCO, said: “South Asians comprise the majority of H-1B workers and are deeply woven into the US economy. By seeking class certification and a preliminary injunction, we seek to halt the proclamation’s imposition of an unlawful $100,000 H-1B fee and this attack on immigrant workers who make a difference to our day to day lives.” “If upheld, the Proclamation would establish a dangerous precedent by permitting the Executive Branch to impose sweeping financial barriers on lawful immigration programs without congressional authorization,” she added.The challenge mounted by healthcare providers and educational institutions is not the only one confronting the Trump administration’s $100,000 H-1B fee. The US Chamber of Commerce has also filed a separate lawsuit, arguing that the entry fee is unlawful, economically damaging and undermines the statutory H-1B framework enacted by Congress. In a further escalation, a coalition of 20 US states has more recently moved the courts, contending that the proclamation unlawfully shifts immigration policy by executive fiat and harms state economies, public services and employers reliant on skilled foreign workers. Together, the cases signal widening institutional resistance to the fee and raise the prospect of a broader judicial reckoning over the administration’s authority to impose sweeping immigration costs without legislative approval.","US healthcare providers, educational institutions and employers have moved to court seeking urgent relief from the Trump administration’s controversial $100,000 entry-fee for H-1B workers.

Skilled labour gap: Walmart steps up training to build in-house technicians; US companies widen push to fix trade shortages,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/skilled-labour-gap-walmart-steps-up-training-to-build-in-house-technicians-us-companies-widen-push-to-fix-trade-shortages/articleshow/126092789.cms,"Photo credit - AP

As the pool of skilled tradespeople continues to shrink in the US, Walmart is moving to strengthen its in-house workforce to keep its vast operations running — from conveyor belts and refrigeration systems to electrical networks and basic infrastructure at stores and distribution centres, AP reported.The world’s largest retailer and biggest private employer has revamped its training programme over the past year to expand the pipeline of maintenance technicians, a category of jobs that has become increasingly difficult to fill amid a tightening labour market. These technicians handle tasks ranging from equipment repair to electrical and mechanical work across Walmart’s logistics hubs and retail outlets.The shortage has opened new career paths for workers such as Liz Cardenas, 24, who joined Walmart in May 2023 as an automation equipment operator at a distribution centre in Lancaster, Texas. Her initial role involved monitoring conveyor belts to ensure cartons moved smoothly. Today, she fixes conveyor systems and other machinery when they break down.Cardenas said her hourly pay has nearly doubled to $43.50, and she plans to undergo further training that could bring higher pay and responsibility.“I was able to move out of my parents’ house,” she said. “I have my own apartment. I was able to get a car, and I’m able to give more to my 401(k).”Analysts say labour shortages have been driven by a wave of retirements and a slowdown in immigration that began during the pandemic and has since intensified with President Donald Trump’s aggressive deportation push. In skilled trades, the problem is sharper. A McKinsey analysis of 12 trade categories — including welders, carpenters and maintenance technicians — projected an imbalance of 20 job openings for every one net new worker between 2022 and 2032.McKinsey warned that high churn could cost companies more than $5.3 billion annually in hiring and training expenses alone. The shortages are unfolding even as some firms cut jobs amid higher costs from tariffs, shifts in consumer spending and rising investments in artificial intelligence.In response, the Business Roundtable — a lobbying group representing chief executives of about 150 major US companies — launched a new initiative in June to address shortages in skilled trades. Co-led by home improvement retailer Lowe’s, the effort involves outreach to elementary, middle and high schools to raise awareness about trade careers.“While technology continues to evolve, it cannot replace plumbers, electricians, construction workers, maintenance and repair pros, or other tradespeople,” said Lowe’s chairman and CEO Marvin Ellison.Lowe’s began a 90-day online training programme in 2022 for employees interested in trades such as carpentry and utility maintenance. Its charitable arm has also invested $43 million since 2023 in 60 organisations, including technical colleges and non-profits, to recruit and train skilled workers.Mervin Jebaraj of the University of Arkansas’s Walton College of Business said such programmes may ease shortages but will not close the gap, especially given tighter immigration. “For as long as somebody physically needs to fix this, the shortage will persist,” he said. “We don’t have enough people.”Walmart chief executive Doug McMillon told AP that lack of awareness was a major factor. “Most Americans probably don’t know what a tech makes that helps take care of our stores and clubs,” he said.Walmart overhauled its tuition-free training initiative in spring 2024, initially in the Dallas-Fort Worth area, and later expanded it to Vincennes, Indiana, and Jacksonville, Florida. The programme blends classroom learning with hands-on instruction in HVAC, electrical work and general maintenance.Nearly 400 employees had graduated as of mid-November, Walmart said. All 108 associates from the pilot batch secured technician roles, with average pay around $32 an hour. The company aims to train 4,000 workers by 2030.R.J. Zanes, vice-president of facility services for Walmart and Sam’s Club in the US, said maintenance roles are especially critical during the holiday season. A refrigeration failure at a single store can lead to losses of $300,000 to $400,000 in spoiled goods, he said.“We have to ensure that we’ve got the right skills there to do preventative maintenance,” Zanes said, “and when we do have a breakdown, get it back up as fast as possible to minimise downtime.”",The world’s largest retailer has revamped its training programme over the past year to expand the pipeline of maintenance technicians.

‘My job was not to command & control’: Long-time CEO reveals leadership lessons that changed his career,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/my-job-was-not-to-command-control-longtime-ceo-reveals-leadership-lessons-that-changed-his-career-key-takeaways/articleshow/126092089.cms,"File photo: Garry Ridge

Garry Ridge had already spent two years as CEO when he realised his biggest challenge was not the business, but himself.In 1999, while leading WD-40, Ridge enrolled in a master’s programme in executive leadership at the University of San Diego, believing he needed to change to help the company grow, as per CNBC.At the time, Ridge thought strong leadership meant being firm and directive. He described himself as a “be brief, be bright, be gone” leader who believed in command and control.But his time in business school, guided by professor Ken Blanchard, shifted that mindset. Ridge learned that his role was not to control people, but to support and empower them.Instead of running WD-40 with authority alone, he began focusing on belonging, trust and shared purpose. “My job was not to command and control,” Ridge said, adding that he could not grow the company on his own.This change proved critical as WD-40 expanded into 176 countries during his tenure.Ridge shared these reflections during an episode of Simon Sinek’s podcast “A Bit of Optimism”, where he spoke about how his leadership thinking evolved over time.Ridge said creating a safe environment was key, where employees felt confident enough to make decisions and take risks.“I had to make sure [people were] in an environment where they felt safe enough to make decisions and be brave,” he explained during the same podcast conversation.Now a leadership coach based in California, Ridge says many CEOs still struggle with the same toxic habits he once had. He warned against copying leaders with big egos, little empathy and a need to micromanage, calling it a flawed model, as per CNBC.To practise what he calls “servant leadership”, Ridge made small but meaningful choices. He reminded himself to praise others, avoided special privileges like a private parking space, and chose not to sit in a much larger office than his staff.His core belief is simple: “The will of the people times the strategy equals the outcome.” Ridge said when leaders focus on people, purpose, values and learning, employees are far more motivated to deliver results.","Garry Ridge was CEO of WD-40 when he realised he needed to change.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground.Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change, too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

Space sector start-up Sisir Radar to develop SAR on L/P band SAR,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/space-sector-start-up-sisir-radar-to-develop-sar-on-l/p-band-sar/articleshow/104558111.cms,"CHENNAI: Space sector startup, Sisir Radar Private Ltd has hit success at the prestigious iDEX DefSpace Challenge with its projects for development of “L/P band Continuous Wave SAR (synthetic aperture radar) payload for LEO Small Satellites” and “Unfurlable, Electronically Steering Antenna for L/P band SAR payload” for Indian Air Force (IAF), said a top company official.The company is promoted by former Director at the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) Tapan Misra and the brains behind the Indian space agency’s RISAT series of SAR satellites as well as the Dual Frequency SAR on the Chandrayaan 2 orbiter that is currently circling the moon.""A grant of Rs 3 crore is also there for development of the products,"" Misra told IANS.Synthetic Aperture Radar or SAR is a special kind of imaging radar technology that can provide extremely accurate high resolution imagery of the terrain through clouds, smoke and dust even in pitch dark conditions. SAR imagery provides much higher resolution than other forms of remote sensing technology such as hyperspectral and multispectral. SAR is a critical technology for strategic reconnaissance and planning as well as for disaster management.According to Misra, winning the challenge in just over a year of floating the company is a major booster.He said L and P band SAR have an advantage over other frequencies (like X band) when it comes to penetration capabilities through rain, clouds, foliage and vegetation in a tropical country like India, and underground penetration capabilities in dry terrain.Continuing further, he said the L band SAR will provide 1 metre resolution, spotlight resolution in Stripmap mode. The current industry standard is 5-10 metre in L band. Misra said both the L and P band will operate simultaneously from a satellite borne SAR. Recently, Sisir Radar successfully developed and tested the world’s highest resolution L-Band SAR fitted on a drone. With 0.2 metre resolution, this is by far the highest L band SAR in the world, he said.","Space sector startup, Sisir Radar Private Ltd has hit success at the prestigious iDEX DefSpace Challenge.

Explainer: What is 'Hindu rate of growth' and why Raghuram Rajan's remarks may be 'premature',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/explainer-what-is-hindu-rate-of-growth-and-why-raghuram-rajans-remarks-may-be-premature/articleshow/98482598.cms,"What is meant by Hindu growth rate

How India's GDP has been growing

What SBI report said on savings and investment

Incremental capital output ratio

NEW DELHI: India's gross domestic product (GDP) data for the third quarter (October-December 2022) received a word of caution from the former Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Raghuram Rajan In an interview with news agency PTI, Rajan that India is ""dangerously close"" to the Hindu rate of growth in view of subdued private sector investment, high interest rates and slowing global growth.India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%.Rajan termed this sequential slowdown in growth as ""worrying"".However, a report released by the State Bank of India (SBI) economists on Tuesday dismissed arguments that India is dangerously close to Hindu rate of growth saying such statements are ""ill-conceived, biased and premature"".The term 'Hindu growth rate' was coined by late economist Raj Krishna in 1978 to describe the slow growth in the country.It basically refers to the low pace of economic growth rates during 1950s to 1980s. During this period, the Indian economy averaged 3.5%.A former lecturer at the Delhi School of Economics (DSE), Krishna noted that only if the rate of growth is persistently slow and accompanied by low per-capita GDP, then it will be known as Hindu rate of growth but it has to factor in population growth as well.Before economic reforms of 1991, India's economic growth remained stagnant and low, while per capita income averaged around 1.3%.Krishna termed this low growth situation to be a result of socialist policies of state control and import substitution.However, the economic situation changed when liberalisation, privatisation and globalisation (LPG) reforms came into effect in the year 1991, at a time when India faced balance of payment crisis.Over the years, many economists have strongly opposed the idea of 'Hindu growth rate' and the term never had universal acceptance.The Indian economy plunged into its very first technical recession in FY21 due to the impact of Covid-19 pandemic and the related nationwide lockdowns. GDP shrunk by an unprecedented 23.8% in the first quarter of the financial year 2020-21. However, due to spurt in economic activities in the subsequent quarters, the GDP decline started to narrow.However, if we look at the period before Covid-19 as well, India's growth curve shows a declining trend.From 8.26% in FY17, GDP growth plunged to 3.74% in FY20. Shutdown of economic activities in FY21 in wake of Covid-19 only made matters worse.As lockdowns started to ease and business activities resumed, India's GDP also started rising. In Q1 of FY22, growth jumped to 20.1% mainly on account of low base effect. By the fourth quarter of FY22, growth came down to 4.10%.Similarly, the new financial year 2022-23 brought fresh economic challenges in the form of Russia-Ukraine war that impacted almost all major economies of the world, slowed the pace of growth, pushed inflation to record highs.As a result, the central banks of all advanced economies spurred into action and opted for monetary policy tightening to curb the soaring inflation.With persistently rising interest rates, India's economy grew by 4.4% in Q3 of FY23, as the Centre revised upwards GDP growth for previous year to 9.10% from 8.7% earlier.The report weighed recent GDP numbers against the available data on savings and investments for the past decade and highlighted some interesting points.""Quarterly growth numbers are noisy and should be best avoided for any serious interpretation (on an average, India's GDP growth has witnessed Rs 2 lakh crore upward revision for the 3 year ended FY23),"" the report said.Gross capital formation (GCF) by the government touched a high of 11.8% in 2021-22, up from 10.7% in 2020-21.""This also had a domino effect on private sector investment that jumped from 10 per cent to 10.8% over the same period,"" it said.In fact, Ecowrap added that the trends in GCF to gross output ratio or the plough back of funds for creation of fresh capacity shows that for public administration the ratio attained fresh peak in 2021-22 owing to the emphasis on capital expenditure in recent budgets.At the aggregate level, gross capital formation is supposed to have crossed 32% in 2022-23, the highest level since 2018-19.According to the report, in 2021-22, gross savings have risen to 30% from 29% in 2020-21.""The ratio is supposed to have crossed 31 per cent in 2022-23, the highest since 2018-19. The household savings increased sharply during the pandemic period on account of sharp accretion in financial savings such as deposits,"" said the report by SBI's Economic Research Department.While household financial savings have since then moderated from 15.4% in 2020-21 to 11.1% in 2022-23, savings in physical assets have grown sharply to 11.8% in 2021-22 from 10.7% in 2020-21.The report further analysed Incremental Capital Output ratio (ICOR) -- which measures additional units of capital (investment) needed to produce additional units of output. It said that the ratio has been improving.""ICOR which was 7.5 in FY 12 is now only 3.5 in FY22. Clearly, only half of capital is now needed for next unit of output,"" the report noted.Such reducing ICOR in the current years reflects a relatively increasing efficiency of capital and shows that the economy is on a sound footing, the report said.""From that point of view, future GDP growth rates even at 7% could still mean a decent number by any standards!,"" it added.","India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%. Raghuram Rajan termed this sequential slowdown in growth as ""worrying""","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-98483158,imgsize-65724,width-400,resizemode-4/98483158.jpg"

Star Health urges lower costs for sustainability,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/star-health-urges-lower-costs-for-sustainability/articleshow/121303171.cms,"Representative image

MUMBAI: The country's largest standalone health insurer, Star Health and Allied Insurance , called for further reduction in distribution costs, including commissions, to make health insurance more sustainable. The company's CEO, Anand Roy, said that while the current cap on management expenses stands at 35%, it should be reduced gradually by a percentage point every year.""We are among the few companies operating within the expense of management (EOM) limits,"" Roy said, adding that ""bringing this cap down over time is essential to bring down the cost of insurance."" He also called for GST waivers on health premiums for senior citizens and vulnerable groups and urged for greater regulation in healthcare delivery, which remains largely unregulated compared to the insurance sector.On medical inflation, Roy said that while the headline figure of 14%, which is always talked about in the industry, may not apply uniformly, it reflects the broad trend in the insured population. ""For us, it may be closer to 8-10% depending on the hospital,"" he said. He attributed rising costs to growing consumer preference for advanced treatments and high-end implants.Roy said moderate and regular hikes in premiums are inevitable but suggested discounts for customers maintaining good health as a way to keep premiums affordable. ""Ideally, 2-3% of a family's income should go towards health insurance,"" he said, recommending higher allocations for those covering parents or in-laws.","Star Health and Allied Insurance called for further reduction in distribution costs.

NEW DELHI: Growth in the country's key core sector slowed to an 8-month low in April as six of the eight sectors slowed sharply, with three of them contracting during the month. Data released by the ministry of commerce and industry on Tuesday showed the growth in eight core sectors - spanning coal, crude oil, natural gas, refinery products, fertilisers, steel, cement, and electricity - slowed to 0.5% in April, below the upwardly revised 4.6% in March and also way below the 6.9% in April last year.The cement sector grew by 6.7%, lower than the 12.2% in March, while the steel sector grew by 3% during the month, slower than the 9.3% in March.

""The deceleration was broad-based, led by six of the eight sectors, barring coal and natural gas. Based on the tepid rise in the core sector and the performance of the other available high-frequency indicators, we expect the IIP growth to moderate sharply to 1% in April.

This cap may be raised following a review. Additionally, the proposed framework will likely mandate majority ownership by the Indian partner in the venture.“We are open to allowing foreign investment... We can even go up to 49%, but in tranches,” a senior government official told ET.At present, the nuclear energy sector currently sits on the negative list for FDI and remains entirely under government control. But with ambitious plans to increase nuclear power generation capacity from the present 8 GW to 40 GW by 2035, the government is preparing the ground for private and foreign participation.Earlier during the February budget, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman had also announced amending the Atomic Energy Act and the Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage Act. These legal changes are crucial to facilitate a larger role for private entities in India’s nuclear power programme.“Development of at least 100 GW of nuclear energy by 2047 is essential for our energy transition efforts. For an active partnership with the private sector towards this goal, amendments to the Atomic Energy Act and the Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage Act will be taken up,” Sitharaman had said.She also announced a Rs 20,000 crore outlay for a Nuclear Energy Mission, focused on research and development of Small Modular Reactors (SMRs). The government aims to operationalise at least five indigenous SMRs by 2033.The official said that changes to the Acts are currently being finalised, with ongoing discussions involving key stakeholders. Committees made up of senior government officials have been set up to draft and finalise these amendments, and the process is actively underway.Industry interest is already picking up in India's nuclear sector.

NEW DELHI: Elon Musk on Tuesday reaffirmed his commitment to lead Tesla for at least the next five years, addressing investor concerns and political backlash during a video appearance at the Qatar Economic Forum hosted by Bloomberg. His remarks followed a recent trip to Doha as part of US President Donald Trump ’s Middle East delegation.When moderator Mishal Husain asked whether he intended to remain Tesla's chief executive, Musk replied simply, ""Yes."" Pressed further on whether he had any doubts, he quipped: ""I can't be still here if I'm dead.""Tesla has faced mounting scrutiny in recent months following Musk’s collaboration with President Trump’s Department of Government Efficiency, a controversial initiative that oversaw sweeping cuts across the US federal workforce. The association led to a decline in Tesla's sales and share price, as well as violent protests targeting the company's dealerships.Asked about the impact of his political involvement and the backlash against Tesla, Musk responded: “I did what needed to be done. I'm not someone who has ever committed violence and yet massive violence was committed against my companies, massive violence was threatened against me.” Referring to those responsible, he added pointedly, “Don’t worry; we’re coming for you.”Musk also addressed his political contributions , including a reported $250 million toward Trump’s 2024 re-election campaign. “I think I’ve done enough,” he said. “In terms of political spending, I’m going to do a lot less in the future.”The Tesla chief took aim at Delaware Chancellor Kathaleen St. Jude McCormick, who recently blocked his $56 billion Tesla pay package. Musk dismissed her as “an activist who is cosplaying a judge in a Halloween costume.”Despite the legal setback, Musk acknowledged that compensation is part of his consideration to remain with Tesla. However, he underscored that his primary concern is maintaining control of the company's direction. “It’s not a money thing, it’s a reasonable control thing over the future of the company,” he said, “especially if we’re building millions, potentially billions of humanoid robots .”",Elon Musk reaffirmed his commitment to lead Tesla for at least the next five years.

It has been forty-seven days since the 47th US President sent the global economy into a turmoil. On April 2, Donald Trump announced his sweeping tariff hikes, regional trade recalibrations, on he what he called the. Trump’s “economic nationalism” has reawakened tensions last seen during his first term only this time, the stakes appear even higher.Trump's aggressive use of tariffs justified as ""reciprocal"" measures to correct unfair trade practices has rocked global supply chains, strained diplomatic ties, and rattled financial markets.On 'liberation day', Trump announced his sweeping tariffs while some countries faced a universal 10% tariff, others were subjected to higher import duties. Products from China faced a combined import duty of 104%, including reciprocal tariffs and a previously announced 20% duty.Other nations affected included Vietnam with a 46% tariff, Taiwan at 32%, and India at 26%. South Korea and Japan are facing 25% and 24% tariffs, respectively, while countries like Australia, the United Kingdom, and Brazil face a baseline tariff of 10%.However in a sudden shift on April 9, Trump announced he suspended his reciprocal tariffs for the next 90 days, setting a universal tariff rate of 10%, for all countries barring China.The Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) this week warned that trade in the region is approaching stagnation. APEC’s report shows export growth plummeting from 5.7% in 2024 to just 0.4% this year. Imports are nearly flat. The group’s director, Carlos Kuriyama, said rising tariffs are fuelling a “loss of investor confidence” and weakening demand, with implications for jobs and GDP. APEC’s forecast for regional growth has dropped to 2.6% for 2025, down from 3.3% earlier projected.The volatility has hit large and small businesses alike. Walmart, the world’s largest retailer, said last week it would be forced to raise prices due to tariff-related costs. Trump lashed out, posting online: “Between Walmart and China they should, as is said, ‘EAT THE TARIFFS,’ and not charge valued customers ANYTHING.”Behind the scenes, Scott Bessent spoke with Walmart CEO Doug McMillon , who reportedly agreed to absorb some costs. “Walmart is, in fact, going to... eat some of the tariffs,” Bessent said in an interview, adding he had not pressured the company.The S&P 500 initially plummeted by up to 15% following the tariff declaration. However, a subsequent 90-day pause in tariffs and a provisional US-China trade agreement spurred a robust rebound. By mid-May, the index had not only recouped its losses but also posted a year-to-date gain of 0.1% . Despite this recovery, analysts caution that persistent high valuations and underlying economic uncertainties could pose risks to sustained growth .After the tariff announcement BSE Sensex faced headwinds, however India's stock market became the first among global economies to recover from Trump's trade shock. The intensifying US-China trade war strengthened India’s appeal as an attractive alternative for global manufacturing.Japan's Nikkei 225 index has experienced notable declines, dropping from a high of 34,609 on 10 April to approximately 33,740 in early May. This represents a decrease of about 2.5%, reflecting investor apprehension over global trade disputes and their potential impact on Japan's export-driven economy .As per the Allianz Trade Global Survey 2025, global exporters are grappling with serious uncertainty following the US’s new trade war.Nearly 60% of firms expect negative impacts, with just under half forecasting positive export growth, down from 80% pre-announcement. Turnover expectations have plummeted, and firms in Germany, Italy, and China are shifting strategies, focusing either on cost-cutting or diversification.One-third of companies have already found new export or supply markets, with two-thirds planning to follow suit. Supply chain rerouting is accelerating, especially as tariffs remain high despite a new US-China trade deal. American firms are favouring Latin America and Western Europe, while Chinese companies are pivoting towards Asia-Pacific. Payment delays are rising, with fewer firms being paid within 30 days and longer terms hitting smaller exporters hardest.Nearly half of firms fear increased non-payment risk. As a result, most are raising prices or passing tariff costs to suppliers. Despite some easing measures, trade tensions remain volatile, and derisking is expected to continue. European and Latin American markets are gaining ground as exporters retreat from direct US-China engagement, prompting a global reshuffle in supply chains and export strategies.In South Korea, where APEC ministers are currently meeting, officials are trying to stabilise trade cooperation amid the turbulence. Despite recent talks between US and Chinese trade envoys, there’s little optimism for a return to pre-tariff normalcy. “This is positive, but this is not taking us to the situation before April,” Kuriyama said, referencing Trump’s aggressive new trade moves.Many nations are now pivoting toward regional deals in response to the United States' retreat from globalism. “This is the rate for Central America. This is the rate for this part of Africa,” Bessent said, describing the administration’s regional strategy.Yet experts say such fragmentation only exacerbates instability. “Uncertainty is dangerous,” Kuriyama warned, as quoted by AFP. “We need to make sure policies are steady... and not temporary.”Domestically, the White House insists its plan is delivering results. A spokesman toldthe administration is “slashing costly regulations, lowering energy prices, cutting Joe Biden’s runaway spending that sparked inflation,” and attracting historic investment in critical sectors. A Wall Street Journal piece cited by the White House claimed some small manufacturers are seeing an uptick in business thanks to protectionist measures.But critics argue these benefits are sparse and do not outweigh the harm. Heidi Shierholz of the Economic Policy Institute says there’s no broad constituency demanding tariffs at this scale. Former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers was more blunt, telling Axios that the measures are likely “to create fewer good-paying jobs”.For workers, the reality is bleak. Thousands of federal employees have been laid off, unions are under pressure, and minimum wages for contractors have been cut. Regulatory agencies protecting labour rights have also been weakened. In the private sector, management has grown emboldened, with fewer protections for employees and more volatility in hiring.Consumers, too, are beginning to feel the squeeze. Higher production costs due to tariffs are pushing up prices. Even with inflation easing, those savings are quickly offset by rising retail prices and economic uncertainty.","It has been forty-seven days since the 47th US President sent the global economy into a turmoil.

US tariff and trade uncertainty have 'negative credit consequences for emerging market debt issuers': Moody's,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-tariff-and-trade-uncertainty-have-negative-credit-consequences-for-emerging-market-debt-issuers-moodys/articleshow/121289368.cms,"AI-generated image

Moody’s Ratings said that continued uncertainty surrounding US tariffs is adversely affecting the credit profile of debt issuers across emerging global markets, including corporations, governments, and financial institutions.“The on-again, off-again nature of US tariffs and the difficulty in predicting US trade policy have negative credit consequences for emerging market debt issuers,” Moody’s said in a recent repor. The agency also cited rising geopolitical tensions, such as of India-Pakistan, as additional challenges facing emerging economies, as reported by news agency PTI.While exporters are directly exposed to shifts in US tariff policy, most debt issuers face broader, indirect impacts. These include slower economic growth, commodity price volatility, currency depreciation, and increased investor risk aversion.“The raft of tariffs the US administration has announced, modified, and paused this year continues to weigh on credit conditions for companies, sovereigns, and financial institutions in emerging markets,” Moody’s said.Organisations heavily reliant on US exports are particularly vulnerable.However, the broader consequences of trade policy volatility extend to nearly all emerging market entities, influencing consumer sentiment, business activity, and financial sector performance- even amid evolving tariff arrangements.In early April, the US administration announced sweeping country-specific tariffs, only to suspend them for 90 days shortly thereafter. A baseline 10 per cent tariff remains in effect, with selected exemptions for specific sectors and pre-existing higher rates on items such as steel and aluminium.The US also raised tariffs on most Chinese imports to 145 per cent, prompting China to respond with duties of up to 125 per cent on American goods. On May 14, both nations agreed to a temporary easing of select tariffs for 90 days—reducing US tariffs on Chinese goods to 30 per cent and Chinese tariffs on US imports to 10 per cent.“This development in US-China trade talks helps alleviate some pressure on global trade and improves the balance of risks surrounding the global growth outlook,” Moody’s observed.Nonetheless, US tariffs on other key trading partners and sectors remain in place or under negotiation. The continued trade uncertainty is dampening consumer and business confidence, curbing spending, and delaying investment decisions.Earlier this month, the US secured temporary trade agreements with both China and the UK. “We expect negotiations will open with additional countries, but a full reversal of tariff levels appears unlikely,” Moody’s added.Moody's statement on US tariffs comes just days after it lowered its top-tier credit rating, Moody’s Investors Service downgraded the country’s long-held Aaa rating to Aa1, citing ballooning government debt and persistent deficits.The credit rating downgrade occurred as US President Donald Trump's proposed tax and spending bill, worth trillions of dollars, failed to secure approval, facing opposition from fiscally conservative Republicans.With Moody's latest action following earlier downgrades by S&P in 2011 and Fitch in 2023, the United States no longer maintains a triple-A rating from any of the major credit assessment firms.Moody'sj ustifieded their decision by pointing to the sustained increase in government debt and interest payments over the past decade, which now significantly exceed levels seen in comparably rated nations.The agency forecasts that federal deficits will expand to almost 9% of GDP by 2035, increasing from 6.4% in 2023, primarily due to escalating interest expenses, social programme costs, and constrained revenue growth. This trajectory suggests US federal debt will increase to 134% of GDP by 2035, compared to 98% in the previous year.Read more: Moody’s strips US of last triple-A credit rating over soaring debt: What it means for Trump","Moody’s Ratings said that continued uncertainty surrounding US tariffs is adversely affecting the credit profile of debt issuers across emerging global markets.

The 2025-26 Victorian state budget, delivered by Australian treasurer Jaclyn Symes , promises to deliver on “what matters most” with sweeping investments in health, schools and public transport. Some sectors, however, are left out in the cold.Symes revealed a massive $11.1 billion boost to health, a $5 billion public transport blitz, and a landmark commitment to free travel for young Victorians, as per the Guardian.Here are the winners and losing sectors of the 2025-26 budgetFrom 2026, all Victorians under 18 will be able to travel on public transport for free, using a new $5 youth Myki card. The $318 million program is expected to benefit over one million children and save families up to $755 per child each year. Alongside children, seniors will also enjoy free public transport on weekends.School-aged children will see an increase in support for camps, sports and excursions, with eligible students receiving $400, up from $154 for primary and $256 for high school students. More than 65,000 Get Active Kids vouchers will be available for concession card holders.Additionally, $1.5 billion has been allocated for new and expanded schools, and lower-income households will get a $100 energy rebate.The budget delivered a major $11.1 billion health funding boost, including $9.3 billion for hospitals and $634 million to open or upgrade nine hospitals across Victoria, among them Footscray, Craigieburn, Cranbourne and Phillip Island.Meanwhile, paramedics will receive $84 million in support, while emergency departments will benefit from $58 million aimed at cutting waiting times.A trial allowing pharmacists to treat UTIs and reissue contraceptives without a doctor’s script will be expanded and made permanent. Pharmacists will now also be able to prescribe for allergies and high blood pressure.An almost $5 billion investment will see the Metro Tunnel ""switch on"" by the end of the year with $727 million committed, and $98.7 million will boost frequency on seven regional and metro train lines.Sunshine Station will receive a $4.1 billion upgrade as part of the Melbourne Airport Rail project, while $1 billion will go towards fixing roads and potholes in a “better road blitz”.However, a planned upgrade to Myki is $136.76 million over budget and running 18 months late.There are no new taxes on businesses this time, with the government committing hundreds of millions to boost business capacity and investment.This includes a $150 million Victorian investment fund, a third of which is reserved for regional areas, $4 million to develop entrepreneur skills, and $240 million tied to economic growth strategies, such as red tape reduction and workforce training support.Treasurer Jaclyn Symes said the budget plans for 1,200 less full-time public servants, and that number could grow to around 3,000 after the government finishes its review of the public sector by 30 June. While Symes said these won’t affect frontline services and are partly due to natural attrition, the cuts represent a significant downsizing of the bureaucracy.Despite previous promises to help millennials into the housing market, there’s no bold new housing vision in this year’s budget.There’s a modest $249 million joint spend with the federal government for infrastructure to support 4,000 new homes, and stamp duty concessions for off-the-plan homes are extended to October 2026 and expanded to more buyers.But Victoria’s target of building 800,000 new homes by 2034 still feels out of reach.While the state is forecast to post a $600 million operating surplus in 2025-26, its first since the pandemic, the story lies in the $12.2 billion overall deficit once infrastructure spending is included.The government is sticking to its promise to keep net debt below 25% of state output, but the actual debt level continues to climb now forecast to hit $194 billion by 2029, well up from the $155.5 billion projected for mid-2024.","The 2025-26 Victorian state budget promises to deliver on ""what matters most"" with sweeping investments in health, schools and public transport.

Blockbuster listing

Controversial IPO

Shares of battery maker CATL or Contemporary Amperex Technology Co Limited, soared more than 13%, after the company’s debut in Hong Kong’s stock market on Tuesday. The company raised a whopping $4.6 billion, making it the biggest initial public offering anywhere in the world so far this year.CATL is a global leader in electric vehicle battery manufacturing, producing more than a third of all EV batteries sold worldwide. The company’s secondary listing in Hong Kong comes as it ramps up efforts to expand globally, especially across Europe.The stock jumped to a high of HK$299.80 during morning trading, recording a 13.7% rise from its listing price of HK$263.00.CATL is already listed on the Shenzhen Stock Exchange in southern China, and its secondary listing in Hong Kong was announced last December. The funds raised from the Hong Kong listing are expected to fuel CATL’s overseas growth. The company is already building a second European factory in Hungary, following the opening of its first in Germany last year. It has also partnered with automotive giant Stellantis on a $4.6 billion battery plant in Spain, due to begin production by late 2026.Tuesday’s listing comes as Hong Kong’s stock exchange looks forward to bringing back major Chinese firms, aiming to reclaim its title as the world’s premier IPO venue.The financial markets had seen a downturn in new listings after a regulatory crackdown by Beijing in 2020 prompted several mainland giants to hold their IPO plans.Meanwhile, CATL’s debut has not been without controversy. In January, the US defence department designated the company as a “Chinese military company.” In April, the US house select committee on the Chinese Communist Party urged JPMorgan and Bank of America to back out of the IPO. Both banks, however, remained involved in the deal.CATL has rejected the allegations, saying it has never engaged in any military-related activities. Beijing also criticised the US listing as political ""suppression"".In a strategic move to minimise potential legal fallout, CATL structured the deal as a Regulation S offering, meaning shares cannot be sold to US-based investors.Founded in 2011 in the Chinese city of Ningde, CATL flourished on the back of China's booming EV sector, strong state backing, and partnerships with major automakers including Tesla, Mercedes-Benz, BMW and Volkswagen.","CATL is a global leader in electric vehicle battery manufacturing, producing more than a third of all EV batteries sold worldwide.

China's central bank cut interest rates to record lows to revive grappling economy,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/chinas-central-bank-cut-interest-rates-to-record-lows-to-revive-grappling-economy/articleshow/121282204.cms,"Mixed picture

China’s central bank on Tuesday slashed two major interest rates to a historical low, in efforts to inject fresh momentum into the economy struggling with weak consumer demand, ongoing property crisis, and deepening trade tensions with the United States.The People's Bank of China announced cutting its one-year loan prime rate (LPR), a key reference for household and business lending, trimming it from 3.1% to 3.0%. The five-year LPR, typically used for mortgages, was also lowered by 10 basis points to 3.5%.These are the lowest rates recorded since the LPR was introduced, and mark the first such cuts since October.The move comes days after Beijing and Washington agreed to temporarily ease tariffs in their protracted trade dispute, giving both sides a 90-day window to de-escalate tensions.Zichun Huang, China economist at capital economics, said that the cuts would offer some relief to heavily indebted companies and households, quoted by AFP.“The rate cuts will reduce interest payments on existing loans, taking some pressure off indebted firms. It will also reduce the price of new loans,” Huang noted, adding “But modest rate cuts alone are unlikely to meaningfully boost loan demand or wider economic activity.”He also suggested that more rate cuts could be on the horizon, noting that these latest reductions might not be the last this year.For 2025, the Asian giant has an annual GDP growth estimate set at 5% which the analysts perceive to be challenging considering the economic headwinds it is facing. However, the first quarter gave unexpectedly strong results with a 5.4% annual expansion, as per preliminary estimates.Fresh data released by the National Bureau of Statistics shows a complex situation, with the country's industrial outputs growing at a rapid rate for the last month, despite the Washington-Beijing trade war, however retail and property sectors slipped.For the month of April, industrial production rose by 6.1% surpassing expectations. However, it was still down from March’s 7.7% rise.Meanwhile, retail sales surged 5.1%, falling short of Bloomberg’s 5.8% forecast, signaling sliding consumer demand.Additionally, cost for new homes fell in 67 out of 70 cities last month, a clear sign of the ongoing slump in the property sector, which continues to drag down economic confidence and spending.","The People's Bank of China announced cutting its one-year loan prime rate (LPR), a key reference for household and business lending.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

Space sector start-up Sisir Radar to develop SAR on L/P band SAR,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/space-sector-start-up-sisir-radar-to-develop-sar-on-l/p-band-sar/articleshow/104558111.cms,"CHENNAI: Space sector startup, Sisir Radar Private Ltd has hit success at the prestigious iDEX DefSpace Challenge with its projects for development of “L/P band Continuous Wave SAR (synthetic aperture radar) payload for LEO Small Satellites” and “Unfurlable, Electronically Steering Antenna for L/P band SAR payload” for Indian Air Force (IAF), said a top company official.The company is promoted by former Director at the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) Tapan Misra and the brains behind the Indian space agency’s RISAT series of SAR satellites as well as the Dual Frequency SAR on the Chandrayaan 2 orbiter that is currently circling the moon.""A grant of Rs 3 crore is also there for development of the products,"" Misra told IANS.Synthetic Aperture Radar or SAR is a special kind of imaging radar technology that can provide extremely accurate high resolution imagery of the terrain through clouds, smoke and dust even in pitch dark conditions. SAR imagery provides much higher resolution than other forms of remote sensing technology such as hyperspectral and multispectral. SAR is a critical technology for strategic reconnaissance and planning as well as for disaster management.According to Misra, winning the challenge in just over a year of floating the company is a major booster.He said L and P band SAR have an advantage over other frequencies (like X band) when it comes to penetration capabilities through rain, clouds, foliage and vegetation in a tropical country like India, and underground penetration capabilities in dry terrain.Continuing further, he said the L band SAR will provide 1 metre resolution, spotlight resolution in Stripmap mode. The current industry standard is 5-10 metre in L band. Misra said both the L and P band will operate simultaneously from a satellite borne SAR. Recently, Sisir Radar successfully developed and tested the world’s highest resolution L-Band SAR fitted on a drone. With 0.2 metre resolution, this is by far the highest L band SAR in the world, he said.","Space sector startup, Sisir Radar Private Ltd has hit success at the prestigious iDEX DefSpace Challenge.

Testify: Sam Bankman-Fried acknowledges 'mistakes' but testifies he did not defraud anyone,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/cryptocurrency/sam-bankman-fried-acknowledges-mistakes-but-testifies-he-did-not-defraud-anyone/articleshow/104761929.cms,"<p>Sam Bankman-Fried (File Photo- Reuters)<br></p>

NEW YORK: Sam Bankman-Fried , testifying in his own defense at his fraud trial on Friday, acknowledged that a ""lot of people got hurt"" when the FTX cryptocurrency exchange he founded collapsed, but said he did not defraud anyone or take customer funds.Shortly after taking the witness stand in Manhattan federal court, Bankman-Fried said he made ""a number of small mistakes and a number of larger mistakes"" while running the now-bankrupt exchange. The biggest mistake, he said, was not implementing a dedicated risk management team.""We thought that we might be able to build the best product on the market,"" Bankman-Fried said. ""It turned out basically the opposite of that. A lot of people got hurt - customers, employees - and the company ended up in bankruptcy.""Prosecutors accuse Bankman-Fried of using FTX customer funds to prop up his crypto-focused hedge fund, Alameda Research, make speculative venture investments and donate more than $100 million to US political campaigns. He also faces charges of scheming to cheat Alameda's lenders and FTX investors.He has pleaded not guiltyBankman-Fried's trial, which began on October 3, is drawing to a close nearly a year after FTX collapsed amid a wave of customer withdrawals. The company declared bankruptcy in November 2022 and Bankman-Fried was indicted the following month.His testimony marked the first time the dozen jurors and five alternates have heard directly from the 31-year-old former billionaire after 12 trial days.Bankman-Fried, who was jailed in August after US District Judge Lewis Kaplan found he likely tampered with witnesses, wore a suit and spoke with two water bottles placed in front of him on the witness stand. The former mogul once known for wearing shorts and T-shirts and sporting an unkempt mop of curly locks cut his hair before his trial began.Responding to questions posed by his defense lawyer Mark Cohen, Bankman-Fried spoke in calm, measured tones during the first portion of his testimony as he recounted founding Alameda in 2017, shortly after graduating from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, despite knowing little about crypto.But Bankman-Fried - who had studied physics and worked as a quantitative trader at Jane Street - said he saw opportunities for ""arbitrage"" in the market for digital assets. He said Alameda's first office was in a small Airbnb in Berkeley, California, before he later moved the firm to Hong Kong.""We wanted to be under the radar at that point in time,"" he said on the stand, adding he named the hedge fund after the California county where it was founded in part so competitors would not discover what they were doing.Jurors have heard from three of his closest confidantes at FTX and Alameda, all of whom have pleaded guilty and agreed to cooperate with prosecutors. They testified earlier this month that they committed financial crimes at Bankman-Fried's behest.For criminal defendants, taking the stand is a risky proposition because it opens them up to potentially probing cross-examination by prosecutors.But given Bankman-Fried's penchant for risk, legal experts say he likely viewed taking the stand as his best shot to counter the allegations made by members of his inner circle, which were backed up by spreadsheets the three said demonstrated how customer funds were stolen and text messages in which they discussed FTX's shortfall of funds with Bankman-Fried.","Sam Bankman-Fried says he made ""a number of small mistakes and a number of larger mistakes"" while running the now-bankrupt exchange.

"Crypto isn’t dead, it’s evolving rapidly to create a new world",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/cryptocurrency/crypto-isnt-dead-its-evolving-rapidly-to-create-a-new-world/articleshow/101324954.cms,"Regulatory landscape



There are few technologies as confusing to most people as crypto and blockchain. The tech and regulations underpinning it are evolving so rapidly, it is difficult for even technologists to often make sense of it.Crypto assets and crypto currencies are based on blockchain tech, which is a form of distributed ledger technology that stores data on thousands of data servers around the world, as opposed to today where data is stored only in one place or clustered in a few locations. This data is open, meaning it can be viewed and verified by anyone taking part in that particular system. What this means practically is that an individual can transfer crypto assets without the help of intermediaries, say, banks or government agencies, thereby ensuring privacy, speed and lower costs.The first cryptocurrency, Bitcoin , was created with anonymity in mind, it was a way for people to conduct financial transactions away from the prying eyes of governments. While it went on to become a speculative asset, today, crypto, and the underlying blockchain technology, has a far more ambitious goal – the transformation of the internet.CoinDCX CTO Vivek Gupta says this technology can help usher in Web 3. 0 – a decentralised form of the internet where users can actually monetise their time spent online. “Whatever Web3 use case you may be driving, the value that comes from it must be distributed, and you cannot distribute that without crypto. For something as simple as depositing money in a pool and getting a receipt token, that receipt token is a crypto. That’s the proof that I have deposited the money. Without crypto there is no Web3 use case,” he says.Decentralised finance (DeFi) is a huge part of what makes blockchain tech so disruptive. Imagine being able to lend your money to strangers on the internet and get paid an interest. Or imagine spending time on socialmedia platforms or playing video games and getting paid for your time spent by someone who needs data about you. Web3 makes this possible because the data isn’t controlled by any one company or country.Decentralised apps (dApps) are another Web3 feature. Unlike traditional apps hosted on centralised servers, dApps operate on a peer-to-peer network and utilisethe consensus mechanism and transparency features of blockchain technology.“I see a big disruption coming, especially in the DeFi tokenisation space and the whole content creator economy,” says Ravi Chamria, co-founder & CEO of Zeeve, a blockchain automation platform.Ashish Singhal, co-founder & CEO of CoinSwitch, says the tech can revolutionise how we conduct business, store data, and even vote, since the tech allows people to verify data of any kind efficiently.Governments are worried about what crypto could mean for monetary policy, for their ability to regulate people’s lives. But disruption hardly ever requires consensus. If a new technology proves to be better than an old one, people will drift towards it.Central banks have recognised the importance of the technology and some are creating Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) that are based on blockchain technology. “There’s a lot of activity happening in the regulated DeFi space. Looking at the future, we think guardrails are probably a good thing to have around these sorts of technologies,” says Andrew Vranjes, VP of sales at Blockdaemon, a blockchain infrastructure platform.Cryptocurrencies too are rapidly changing. Where before the value of cryptocurrencies were based on what people were willing to pay for them, today there are crypto assets that are backed by real world assets like equity and real estate. Silvina Moschini’s Unicoin is one of them. “It is an assets backed, audited, SEC-compliant cryptocurrency,” she says.","Crypto assets and crypto currencies are based on blockchain tech, which is a form of distributed ledger technology that stores data on thousands of data servers around the world.

"US tightens crackdown on crypto with lawsuits against Coinbase, Binance",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/cryptocurrency/bitcoin/us-tightens-crackdown-on-crypto-with-lawsuits-against-coinbase-binance/articleshow/100810119.cms,"BROKER, EXCHANGE CRACKDOWN



NEW YORK: The top U.S. securities regulator sued cryptocurrency platform Coinbase on Tuesday, the second lawsuit in two days against a major crypto exchange, in a dramatic escalation of a crackdown on the industry and one that could dramatically transform a market that has largely operated outside regulation.The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Monday took aim at Binance, the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange. The SEC accuses Binance and its CEO Changpeng Zhao of operating a ""web of deception"".If successful, the lawsuits could transform the crypto market by successfully asserting the SEC's jurisdiction over the industry which for years has argued that tokens do not constitute securities and should not be regulated by the SEC.""The two cases are different, but overlap and point in the same direction: the SEC's increasingly aggressive campaign to bring cryptocurrencies under the jurisdiction of the federal securities laws,"" said Kevin O'Brien, a partner at Ford O'Brien Landy and a former federal prosecutor, adding, however, that the SEC has not previously taken on such major crypto players.""If the SEC prevails in either case, the cryptocurrency industry will be transformed.""In its complaint filed in Manhattan federal court, the SEC said Coinbase has since at least 2019 made billions of dollars by operating as a middleman on crypto transactions, while evading disclosure requirements meant to protect investors.The SEC said Coinbase traded at least 13 crypto assets that are securities that should have been registered, including tokens such as Solana, Cardano and Polygon.Coinbase suffered about $1.28 billion of net customer outflows following the lawsuit, according to initial estimates from data firm Nansen. Shares of Coinbase's parent Coinbase Global Inc closed down $7.10, or 12.1%, at $51.61 after earlier falling as much as 20.9%. They are up 46% this year.Paul Grewal, Coinbase's general counsel, in a statement said the company will continue operating as usual and has ""demonstrated commitment to compliance.""Oanda senior market analyst Ed Moya said the SEC ""looks like it's playing Whac-A-Mole with crypto exchanges,"" and because most exchanges offer a range of tokens that operate on blockchain protocols targeted by regulators, ""it seems like this is just the beginning.""Leading cryptocurrency bitcoin has been a paradoxical beneficiary of the crackdown.After an initial plunge to a nearly three-month low of $25,350 following the Binance suit, bitcoin rebounded by more than $2,000, exceeding the previous day's high. It was trading just below $27,000 at 0410 GMT.""The SEC is making life nearly impossible for several altcoins and that is actually driving some crypto traders back into bitcoin,"" explained Oanda's Moya.Securities, as opposed to other assets such as commodities, are strictly regulated and require detailed disclosures to inform investors of potential risks. The Securities Act of 1933 outlined a definition of the term ""security,"" yet many experts rely on two U.S. Supreme Court cases to determine if an investment product constitutes a security.SEC Chair Gary Gensler has long said tokens constitute securities and has steadily asserted its authority over the crypto market, focusing initially on the sale of tokens and interest-bearing crypto products. More recently, it has taken aim at unregistered crypto broker dealer, exchange trading and clearing activity.While a few crypto companies are licensed as alternative system trading systems, a type of trading platform used by brokers to trade listed securities, no crypto platform operates as a full-blown stock exchange. The SEC also this year sued Beaxy Digital and Bittrex Global for failing to register as an exchange, clearing house and broker.""The whole business model is built on a noncompliance with the U.S. securities laws and we're asking them to come into compliance,"" Gensler told CNBC.Crypto companies refute that tokens meet the definition of a security, say the SEC's rules are ambiguous, and that the SEC is overstepping its authority in trying to regulate them. Still, many companies have boosted compliance, shelved products and expanded outside the country in response to the crackdown.Kristin Smith, CEO of the Blockchain Association trade group, rejected Gensler's efforts to oversee the industry.""We're confident the courts will prove Chair Gensler wrong in due time,"" she said.Founded in 2012, Coinbase recently served more than 108 million customers and ended March with $130 billion of customer crypto assets and funds on its balance sheet. Transactions generated 75% of its $3.15 billion of net revenue last year.Tuesday's SEC lawsuit seeks civil fines, the recouping of ill-gotten gains and injunctive relief.On Monday, the SEC accused Binance of inflating trading volumes, diverting customer funds, improperly commingling assets, failing to restrict U.S. customers from its platform, and misleading customers about its controls.Binance pledged to vigorously defend itself against the lawsuit, which it said reflected the SEC's ""misguided and conscious refusal"" to provide clarity to the crypto industry.Customers pulled around $790 million from Binance and its U.S. affiliate following the lawsuit, Nansen said.On Tuesday, the SEC filed a motion to freeze assets belonging to Binance.US, Binance's U.S. affiliate. The holding company of Binance is based in the Cayman Islands.""It's important to note that recent regulatory actions are aimed at ensuring that companies operating in the cryptocurrency industry are complying with securities laws and protecting investors - this will always be their goal,"" said Joshua Chu, group chief risk officer at blockchain technology firms XBE, Coinllectibles and Marvion.""These events will ultimately lead to a more stable and trustworthy industry, which could help to attract more institutional investors and mainstream adoption.""","The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Monday took aim at Binance. The SEC accuses Binance and its CEO Changpeng Zhao of operating a ""web of deception"" If successful, the lawsuits could transform the crypto market by successfully asserting the SEC's jurisdiction over the industry.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-100810085,imgsize-36192,width-400,resizemode-4/100810085.jpg"

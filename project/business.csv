Gold price prediction today: Gold rates expected to rise in coming months,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/gold-price-prediction-today-where-are-gold-rates-headed-on-september-16-2025-and-in-the-near-term-mcx-gold-outlook/articleshow/123912847.cms,"Gold is likely to rise to $3,800 (Rs 134,000) in the coming months. (AI image)

Gold rates are expected to rise in the coming months and investors would do better to buy the yellow metal on dips rather than chasing the rally, says Praveen Singh, Senior Fundamental Research Analyst- Currencies and Commodities at Mirae Asset Sharekhan.

The analyst shares his views on gold price outlook and what levels investors should watch out for:

Gold Performance:

At the time of writing this article, spot gold was trading at $3,682, up around 1% for the day. The metal rallied to a fresh record high of $3,685 as it bettered its previous record high of $3,674 set on September 9 in the wake of disappointing QCEW report that showed a massive downside revision of 911K jobs in the twelve months through March 2025.The MCX October gold contract at Rs 110,294 was up by around 0.90%.

In the week ending September 12, spot gold posted a weekly gain of 1.58%, extending its weekly winning streak to the fourth straight week, as it closed at $3,643.

Data roundup:

China’s data released on Monday were disappointing. Retail sales grew 3.4% on year in August, down from 3.7% in the previous month, and lower than the forecast of 3.8%, while expansion in fixed-asset investment in the first eight months of the year decelerated sharply to 0.5%, the worst reading for the period on record except for the Covid period in 2020. China's data cast a doubt on the possibility of the Chinese government's GDP growth target of 5% unless more stimulus measures are announced. Industrial production expanded 5.2%, the smallest gain since August 2024, as compared with the forecast of 5.6% and the prior data of 5.7%.

The European Union's surplus in goods trade with the US declined from Euro 11.20 billion in June to Euro 10.70 billion July, which is expected to weaken the region’s 3Q 2025 GDP growth.

US Empire manufacturing (September) came in at -8.70 Vs the forecast of 5, thus, posting the worst reading since June.

Trade and tariff:

US-China talks headed into the second day as representatives of both the nations discussed TikTok, national security issues, trade and economy in Madrid. They are also trying to work out a potential meeting between Trump and Xi in October. China's delegation will be in Spain until September 17.

Reportedly, a TikTok deal has been reached and there could be telephonic conversation between Xi and Trump on September 19.

Over the weekend, Chinese officials began an anti-dumping investigation into certain US chips which are used mostly in smartphones and electric vehicles.

India and the US will hold trade talks in New Delhi on September 16 to sort out their differences over trade matters.

US Dollar Index and yields:

At the time of writing this article, the US Dollar Index at 97.30 was down nearly 0.30%. The Index slipped ahead of the US Federal Reserve's monetary policy decision due on September 17. Apart from the Fed, three other key central banks – Bank of England, Bank of Canada and Bank of Japan, are also set to announce their monetary policies this week.

MSCI emerging market currency index was up around 0.20%.

Two-year US yields fell 2 bps to 3.53% while ten-year US yields at 4.03% were down nearly 3 bps.

Thai authorities to tax gold to slow down currency appreciation:

Thai authorities are discussing ways to tax gold bought and sold as they try to stem a domestic currency rally, up nearly 7% this year, that they find is being driven by bullion shipments also

Gold surpasses inflation-adjusted record high in 1980:

Adjusting for over four decades of inflation the spot price of gold has surpassed its inflation-adjusted peak of $850 set on January 21, 1980, which comes to be around $3590, though there could be some differences in that price level depending on the ways of adjusting inflation.

Gold ETF:

As of September 12, total known global gold ETF holdings stood at 94.61 MOz as holdings rose for the second straight week.

Gold ETF holdings, currently at the highest level since November 2022, are up 365 tons this year/14.19% YTD.

Fitch Ratings downgrades France’s sovereign credit rating:

Rating agency Fitch downgraded France’s sovereign credit rating on Friday by one notch from 'AA-' to 'A+' with a stable outlook. The rating agency cited growing political division and polarization, which increases the possibility of further delay to fiscal consolidation, as the reasons leading to the downgrade.

Upcoming data:

Major Eurozone data on tap include ZEW Survey expectations (September) and industrial production (July). The UK's monthly job report for the month of July will also be out today.

Major US data on cards include retail sales advance (August), industrial production (August), NAHB housing market index (September) and import and export price Indices (August).

Gold Price Outlook:

The current week is a crucial week for the markets as the US Fed will announce its monetary policy on September 17. It is widely expected that the Central Bank will slash the overnight Fed fund rate by 25 bps to 4.25%-4.50% range, though there is a slight possibility of a 50-bps cut, too. Investors expect the Fed to cut rates by 75 bps by the end of the year.

Stronger than expected US retail sales data due today will lead to a profit booking.

The FOMC’s rate decision could be a 25-bps hawkish cut; thus, gold in that case can correct lower. Nonetheless, as the US labour market is seeing disconcerting cracks propagating across it, the downside is expected to be limited.

Gold is likely to rise to $3,800 (Rs 134,000) in the coming months.

Support is at $3,600 (Rs 107,900)/$3,550 (Rs 106,400)/$3,500 (Rs 104,900). Interim resistance is at $3,700 (Rs 110,900).

Buying the dips is favoured over chasing the rally at current prices.

The Income Tax department on Sunday dismissed social media claims suggesting that the deadline for filing Income Tax Returns (ITRs) had been extended beyond September 15, clarifying that the due date remains unchanged.In a post on X, the department said: “A fake news is in circulation stating that the due of filing ITRs (originally due on 31.07.2025, and extended to 15.09.2025) has been further extended to 30.09.2025. The due date for filing ITRs remains 15.09.2025.”The clarification came amid a wave of unverified messages circulating online.The I-T department has urged taxpayers to rely only on updates from its verified handle @IncomeTaxIndia and avoid being misled by false claims. It further noted that its helpdesk is working “on a 24x7 basis” to support taxpayers with ITR filing, tax payment and other related services through calls, live chats, WebEx sessions and X.Over six crore ITRs had already been filed for the Assessment Year 2025-26 as of Saturday.The department thanked taxpayers and professionals for their efforts, while reminding those yet to file to do so before the September 15 deadline to avoid last-minute delays, penalties and interest.The filing window had originally closed on July 31 but was extended to September 15 due to revisions introduced in ITR forms earlier this year.These “structural and content revisions” were rolled out in April–May, requiring changes to filing utilities and back-end systems, which prompted the extension.While this relaxation covered individuals, HUFs and non-audit entities, officials have underlined that a further extension is “unlikely.”Taxpayers missing the deadline can still file a belated return until December 31, 2025, though this attracts late fees under Section 234F of the Income Tax Act — Rs 1,000 for income up to Rs 5 lakh and Rs 5,000 for income above that threshold.Delays also trigger interest liabilities under Sections 234A, 234B and 234C. Moreover, belated filers are shifted to the new tax regime by default and lose the ability to carry forward certain business or capital losses.ITR submissions have been steadily rising in recent years. For AY 2024-25, a record 7.28 crore returns were filed by July 31, 2024, up from 6.77 crore the previous year, marking a 7.5% annual increase.With Monday marking the final day, the department has reiterated its appeal: file early, comply on time, and avoid penalties.",The Income Tax department on Sunday dismissed social media claims suggesting that the deadline for filing Income Tax Returns (ITRs) had been extended beyond September 15.

India’s first private strategic petroleum reserve: Top things to know

The venture includes a crude oil filling expense of $1.25 billion (Rs 11,020 crore) at present rates, representing the most substantial private investment towards strengthening the nation's energy security infrastructure.

The company has been allocated a five-year construction period and a 60-year operational term for a 2.5 million metric tonnes (MMT) strategic petroleum reserve facility in Padur, Karnataka. Padur already hosts portions of India's current strategic reserves.

This new reserve will enhance India's present 5.33-MMT strategic reserves, which currently provide only 8-9 days of crude supply when at capacity, the ET report said.

The bidding process, managed by the state-owned Indian Strategic Petroleum Reserves Ltd (ISPRL), was determined by the viability gap funding (VGF) requirements of participants. The VGF was restricted to 60% of the Rs 5,700-crore project value, amounting to Rs 3,420 crore.

The current strategic petroleum reserve facilities in India, managed by ISPRL, maintain 39 million barrels in underground storage at Visakhapatnam, Mangaluru, and Padur.

This capacity falls significantly short compared to the United States' 727 million barrels and China's estimated 1,200 million barrels.

Readying Buffer





India is looking to build its first-ever private sector strategic petroleum reserve in the next five years. The massive Rs 5,700 crore project contract has been awarded to Megha Engineering & Infrastructures Ltd.According to an ET report quoting sources, Megha Engineering has bagged the significant contract to construct and operate the first private-sector strategic petroleum reserve.Megha emerged as the successful bidder with an offer just under the maximum limit, surpassing two competitors whose identities remain undisclosed, according to informed sources quoted in the report.Sources indicate that ISPRL will shortly finalise the agreement with Megha, providing them a 214-acre plot at no cost for storage development. The agreement is expected to include provisions requiring the company to partially fill the SPR cavern to ensure emergency preparedness objectives are met.According to sources quoted in the report, Megha plans to recover its investment through storage space rentals to the government and oil firms, whilst maintaining autonomy in crude oil trading operations.Whilst storage leasing provides steady revenue, trading activities involve higher risks and require specialist knowledge.The government will maintain priority access to oil reserves during emergencies, ensuring the facility serves both commercial and strategic national interests.The Padur facility includes the construction of specialised infrastructure for oil handling, including both onshore and offshore pipeline networks.Megha's primary business involves EPC contracting for the oil and gas industry, including refinery construction, pipeline installation and rig provision. The company is currently developing an underground LPG storage facility for Hindustan Petroleum.Operating an SPR represents a significant new venture for this Hyderabad-based organisation. The concept of private involvement in India's strategic petroleum reserves was initially proposed more than ten years ago. In 2018, the Union cabinet granted preliminary approval for two PPP model projects: Padur in Karnataka (2.5 MMT) and Chandikhol in Odisha (4 MMT). The development of a suitable framework to attract private investment required several years of planning.","India is looking to build its first-ever private sector strategic petroleum reserve.

NEW DELHI: After a ""positive meeting"" between Indian and American trade negotiators, the two sides have decided to intensify efforts for a bilateral trade agreement, signaling lower turbulence going forward. Amid a conciliatory tone from American President Donald Trump over the last 10 days, India's chief negotiator Rajesh Agarwal and other officials met a team from USTR led by Brendan Lynch and held day long talks, with sources suggesting that things are getting back on track.""Acknowledging the enduring importance of bilateral trade between India and the US, the discussions were positive and forward looking covering various aspects of the trade deal. It was decided to intensify efforts to achieve early conclusion of a mutually beneficial trade agreement,"" the commerce department said in a statement after the keenly watched meeting.A US embassy spokesperson too described the meeting ""to discuss next steps in trade negotiations"" as ""positive"". Sources said that discussions will now move to virtual platforms, and the two sides are expected to finalise the dates for the sixth round of talks, which were scheduled to begin on Aug 25, but were put off in view of tariff actions on India.The statement from both sides will provide cheer to exporters who are keen that the US drops the 50% tariffs on Indian goods, which is hurting domestic players.While Indian goods were facing 25% ""reciprocal tariffs"" since early Aug, the burden doubled towards the end of last month on account of ""secondary sanctions"" imposed by Trump due to India's purchase of Russian oil.Trump has been hitting out at India, calling it the ""tariff king"" for maintaining high duties on imports and is pushing hard for govt to lower the levies on products of interest to it, including automobiles, whiskey, dairy and farm products. While govt is open to lowering duties on industrial goods, it has concerns over agricultural products such as maize, soybean and dairy products, where it has stated its reluctance, triggering an angry response from Washington which imposed significantly higher ""reciprocal tariffs"" on India.","After a ""positive meeting"" between Indian and American trade negotiators, the two sides have decided to intensify efforts for a bilateral trade agreement.

New Delhi: Over a dozen firms, including leading private equity firms, are in the fray to acquire a 10-15% stake in Balaji Wafers, where the promoters are diluting their stake, industry sources said.PE firms, including Temasek, which recently acquired a 10% stake in Haldiram, along with TPG, ADIA (Abu Dhabi Investment Authority) and some 10 other VC/ PE names, are in discussion with the promoters to acquire a minority stake in Balaji Wafers.Besides FMCG companies, ITC Foods is also in the race to acquire a stake in Gujarat-based Balaji Wafers, which has a strong presence in the chips, namkeen and confectionery products in central and western India.The company's valuation is around $3.5-4 billion, but the promoters are expecting around $5 billion in valuation, sources said.ITC Foods, part of multi-conglomerate ITC, could be the likely suitor, they added.Balaji Wafers was founded by Virani brothers who started by selling prepackaged snacks at a cinema canteen in the 1970s. They later started making their own potato wafers and namkeen snacks at home, eventually growing their business into a major Indian snack company.The brand name Balaji was inspired by a Hanuman Temple near their residence.The company, which has 65-plus product SKUs and nearly 1,300 dealers, had crossed Rs 5,000 crore in revenue in 2023.

Asset managers ramp up allocations

Challenges persist despite optimism





After years of scepticism and branding Chinese stock markets as “uninvestable"", foreign investors are once again turning their attention to Chinese equities, betting on the country’s resilience in artificial intelligence, semiconductors and biotech as well as a growing need for diversification beyond US assets.Progress in China’s AI adoption, its push in semiconductors, and breakthroughs in biotech this year have reassured investors that the Sino-US trade war and Washington’s export restrictions have not derailed innovation in the world’s second-largest economy, Reuters reported.Adding to the momentum, a US-China tariff truce and supportive domestic monetary policy have improved sentiment, helping the Shanghai Composite index touch a decade high last week, while Hong Kong’s benchmark hit a four-year peak.Foreign early movers have already started returning, lured by the 2025 bull run and seeking diversification away from crowded US assets. “China is interesting because it's very uncorrelated to the rest of the world, at least the onshore A-share market,” Brett Barna told Reuters, a former hedge fund manager who now runs two New York-based single-family offices. He added that he plans to set up an investment platform allowing US and European capital to access Chinese markets.Data backs the shift. Morgan Stanley said August saw the largest monthly buying of China stocks by global hedge funds in six months. Meanwhile, Morningstar noted that new “emerging market ex-China” fund launches fell sharply to eight in 2025, compared to 21 in 2024 and 16 in 2023—reflecting cooling demand for EM products excluding China.“A year ago, people wanted to exclude China from indices. Now, China is seen as a standalone asset class (they cannot ignore),” said Zheng Yucheng, chief investment officer of the China unit of Allianz Global Investors.London-based Polar Capital, which manages $20 billion, pivoted to a positive stance on China in late 2024, raising its allocation to over 30% from the low 20% range within its EM portfolio. “There is a revaluation of Chinese innovative assets,” said fund manager Jerry Wu, citing AI firm DeepSeek’s cost-efficient model rivaling ChatGPT.Wu added that interest has surged across AI, biotech, and robotics. Polar’s annual conference in February drew 55 clients for the China session—more than double 2023’s attendance.Benjamin Low, senior investment director at Cambridge Associates, said his team has handled about 30 client inquiries for China funds this year, a stark contrast to 2023’s near absence of interest. Many allocators from outside Asia are now planning trips to China and Hong Kong, some for the first time since COVID-19, to explore opportunities.Despite the turnaround in sentiment, structural concerns remain. China’s economy continues to show weakness, with August factory output and retail sales data underscoring sluggish demand. Foreign direct investment fell 13.2% in the first five months of 2025, prompting Beijing to unveil new measures in July to stem the decline.CLSA chief equity strategist Alexander Redman cautioned that deflationary pressures are preventing him from overweighting the market. Wu of Polar Capital also warned that AI’s momentum must translate into wider economic benefits for the rally to last beyond 2025.Foreign investors, analysts said, are now in a “rerating” phase, reassessing China’s long-term competitiveness. “Foreign capital is standing at the door and watching. They haven’t stepped in yet — but are at least thinking about coming back,” said Cheng Yu, portfolio manager at Allianz China.The Chinese stock market, including Hong Kong, is valued at nearly $19 trillion. August’s surge in foreign interest suggests early signs of a broader revival, though the durability of inflows will depend on how Beijing balances innovation with broader economic stability.","Foreign investors are once again turning their attention to Chinese equities.

"US Fed meeting begins: Trump aide Stephen Miran sworn in as governor, Jerome Powell under pressure as rate cut expected",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-fed-meeting-begins-trump-aide-stephen-miran-sworn-in-as-governor-jerome-powell-under-pressure-as-rate-cut-expected/articleshow/123925918.cms,"



The US Federal Reserve opened a key interest rate meeting on Tuesday, just hours after Donald Trump’s close aide Stephen Miran was sworn in as a governor of the central bank, while another top official, Lisa Cook, is fighting the president’s attempt to oust her.Miran, who has been a senior adviser to Trump, took the oath of office on Tuesday, the Fed said in a statement, as its rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) began a two-day policy gathering AFP reported. His arrival followed a narrow Senate vote on Monday night confirming him as one of the FOMC’s 12 voting members.Markets widely expect the Fed to announce its first interest rate cut of 2025 when the meeting concludes on Wednesday, as policymakers seek to shore up a weakening jobs market. But political pressure on the independent central bank has intensified, with Trump repeatedly urging Chair Jerome Powell to cut rates more aggressively.Miran’s appointment gives him a single vote on the FOMC, and it is unclear whether he will align with Trump’s calls for steeper reductions. On Tuesday, Trump told reporters that the Fed should “listen to smart people like me.”Before joining the Fed, Miran was serving as chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers.His decision to take a leave of absence from that role, rather than resign, drew criticism from Democratic lawmakers, particularly as his Fed term lasts just over four months. He is filling the unexpired term of Adriana Kugler, who stepped down before her stint was due to end in late January.The meeting is also overshadowed by Trump’s attempt to remove Cook, a Fed governor appointed by former president Joe Biden, over allegations of mortgage fraud. Cook has not been charged, and the alleged incidents predate her appointment. A federal appeals court ruled late Monday that she could remain in place while her legal challenge proceeds, but the Trump administration plans to take the case to the Supreme Court.White House spokesman Kush Desai told AFP that the president “lawfully removed Lisa Cook for cause,” which he said could mean malfeasance or dereliction of duty. He added: “The administration will appeal this decision and looks forward to ultimate victory on the issue.”The Fed has held its benchmark lending rate between 4.25 percent and 4.50 percent since December, monitoring the impact of Trump’s tariffs on the economy. Markets are betting on a 25-basis point cut this week, while looking for signals on the pace and scale of reductions in the months ahead.","Stephen Miran, a senior adviser to Donald Trump, was sworn in as a governor of the central bank on Tuesday.

"Thyssenkrupp sale: Jindal Steel makes bid for German steel unit, group weighs green steel push and rival interest",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/thyssenkrupp-sale-jindal-steel-makes-bid-for-german-steel-unit-group-weighs-green-steel-push-and-rival-interest/articleshow/123925696.cms,"Workers see ‘good news’

Green steel ambition





Jindal Steel International has made a non-binding offer to acquire Thyssenkrupp’s steel division, the German conglomerate said Tuesday, in a move that could reshape Europe’s traditional steel landscape. The bid, details of which were not disclosed, sent Thyssenkrupp shares soaring nearly 8% in Frankfurt trade, AFP reported.The once-iconic German industrial major has been trying to exit its struggling steel arm — Thyssenkrupp Steel Europe (TKSE) — which has been battling high domestic costs and Asian competition. The group said it would “carefully review” the proposal from Jindal and pay “particular attention” to the implications for jobs.Juergen Kerner, a workers’ representative on Thyssenkrupp’s board, described the offer from the “growth-oriented” Indian steelmaker as positive for employees. “Jindal Steel has its own access to raw materials and expertise in the green transformation,” he said, urging a quick dialogue to resolve workforce concerns.TKSE, which announced plans last year to cut 11,000 jobs by 2030 — about 40% of its workforce — has been under pressure to find a long-term buyer or partner.The Indian offer could trigger a contest with Czech billionaire Daniel Kretinsky, who acquired a stake in the steel unit through his holding firm EPCG and had been in talks for a potential joint venture.Jindal, in its statement, said it was committed to green steel production, aligning with Thyssenkrupp’s shift towards low-emission operations. Narendra Misra, head of European operations at Jindal, said the aim was to “preserve and advance the 200-year-old heritage of Thyssenkrupp” while turning it into “the largest low-emission steel producer in Europe.”The German company has been building a new site in Duisburg to produce carbon-neutral steel, though CEO Miguel Lopez has warned of profitability challenges. Jindal pointed to its Oman project, due to start in 2027, as evidence of its commitment to large-scale green steel ventures.A spokesperson for EPCG declined to comment on the Indian bid, AFP reported. Thyssenkrupp has previously indicated talks with Kretinsky about a 50:50 joint venture were still ongoing.Offloading the steel business forms part of Thyssenkrupp’s wider plan to split itself into standalone businesses to improve profitability.","Jindal Steel International has made a non-binding offer to acquire Thyssenkrupp’s steel division.

The Nasdaq Composite was down 0.1% by mid-morning trade in New York, AP reported.Stocks have rallied this year on expectations that the Fed will begin a series of rate cuts to shore up a slowing jobs market, which many traders now see as a bigger threat to the economy than inflation pressures stoked by President Donald Trump’s tariffs.The Fed has so far held off on easing policy because inflation remains above its 2% target. Markets are betting on a 25-basis point cut on Wednesday, with Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s press conference and the central bank’s updated forecasts expected to draw heavy scrutiny.Tuesday’s data showed US retail sales rose more than expected in August, though analysts said part of the increase reflected higher prices. While the report suggested household spending remains resilient, it did not shift expectations for imminent rate cuts extending into 2026.Global fund managers are tilting their allocations toward equities at the highest level in seven months, a Bank of America survey showed, even as a record 58% of respondents said stocks look overvalued.Corporate movers added to Wall Street’s mixed tone. Dave & Buster’s tumbled 16.1% after posting weaker quarterly profits, while Ralph Lauren slipped 1.3% after unveiling its “Next Great Chapter: Drive” strategy, forecasting mid-single digit annual revenue growth over three years.The New York Times Co. dropped 2.8% after Trump filed a $15 billion defamation lawsuit against the paper and four journalists, citing coverage ahead of the 2024 election.On the upside, Steel Dynamics jumped 5.9% on stronger earnings across its steel units, Oracle rose 1.2% on speculation it could be involved in a TikTok deal, and Chipotle gained 1.2% after authorising a fresh $500 million share buyback.Overseas, Japan’s Nikkei 225 added 0.3% to close at a record despite political uncertainty after Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba announced plans to step down, with a ruling party leadership vote scheduled for October 4.

As Indian investors increasingly seek to diversify their portfolios and secure long-term wealth, Greece is emerging as a strategic gateway, not just to the European Union, but to a lifestyle of prosperity, stability, and growth. More than just a scenic Mediterranean destination, Greece is fast becoming a hotspot for discerning Indian investors seeking to combine financial foresight with international mobility.At the forefront of this shift is MIBS Group , a Greek leading real estate developer that blends deep market knowledge with access to luxury properties, eligible under Greece’s coveted Golden Visa program.Greece’s economic resurgence over the past decade has transformed its real estate market into one of the most promising in Europe. With a projected GDP growth rate of 2.3% for 2025 and a booming tourism sector, property values in key regions like Athens, the capital of Greece, Crete and the Cyclades are appreciating rapidly. Moreover, Greece boasts some of the highest rental yields in Europe, offering investors both capital growth and passive income opportunities.“Indian investors are increasingly thinking long-term,” says Elena Shiapani, CEO of MIBS Group. “They want access to stable, appreciating assets, international mobility, and a high quality of life. Greece delivers on all three fronts, and MIBS Group ensures they invest wisely,” she added.A golden opportunity for diversification with the rupee facing fluctuations and domestic markets maturing, many Indian HNIs (High Net-Worth Individuals) and UHNIs are looking beyond borders. European real estate, especially in countries offering residency rights, has become a key focus.Greece’s Golden Visa programme allows non-EU investors to gain EU residency by purchasing property worth €250,000 or more. This visa grants the holder and their family visa-free travel across the Schengen Zone and access to superior healthcare, education, and a safe, cosmopolitan lifestyle.“Unlike other EU residency programs, Greece offers one of the lowest entry points,” explains Mrs. Shiapani. “It’s an ideal stepping stone for Indian families considering global mobility, children’s education abroad, or retirement in Europe.”Beyond the numbers, Greece offers a quality of life that resonates with Indian investors. Safe urban environments, international schools, a robust public healthcare system, and a relaxed Mediterranean lifestyle have made the country a second home for many. With over 300 days of sunshine, organic cuisine, and access to world-class beaches and cultural heritage, Greece is not just where someone invests their money—it’s where they live their dream.MIBS Group stands apart with its top-notch quality, offering a curated portfolio of high-yield properties , eligible for Golden Visa and end-to-end personalised services, managing the entire journey, from property selection and legal support to after-sales and property management Following the opening of its local office in Mumbai with native experts and bilingual support teams, MIBS Group is helping Indian families successfully navigate the Greek property market.“Our goal is to make the process seamless and strategic,” says Gaurav Tarkar, Head of Business Development & Sales India at MIBS Group. “We are not just selling properties, we are helping investors build generational wealth and global futures,” he added.References:","MIBS Group is a Greek leading real estate developer that blends deep market knowledge with access to luxury properties.

US retail sales rise despite Trump tariffs: August growth beats estimates; consumer spending cushions economy,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-retail-sales-rise-despite-trump-tariffs-august-growth-beats-estimates-consumer-spending-cushions-economy/articleshow/123924166.cms,"



Retail spending in the US exceeded expectations in August, rising 0.6 percent month-on-month, government data showed on Tuesday, even as President Donald Trump's tariffs continue to impact the global trade environment. On a year-on-year basis, retail sales climbed 5 percent.The Commerce Department data highlighted that motor vehicle and parts dealers saw a 0.5 percent increase in sales, while restaurants and bars recorded a 0.7 percent rise. Grocery store sales were up 0.3 percent, reflecting resilient consumer demand in key sectors, AFP reported.However, some areas showed signs of caution. Furniture store sales fell 0.3 percent from July, and general merchandise outlets dipped 0.1 percent, with department stores in particular experiencing a decline. This suggests selective pullback in discretionary spending.Economists note that while importers and retailers have absorbed part of the increased tariff burden, the sustainability of this approach is uncertain. Many businesses had stocked up in anticipation of higher duties earlier this year, but replenishing inventory could involve higher costs going forward.Since returning to office in January, Trump has imposed a 10 percent tariff on goods from multiple trading partners, later raising rates for dozens of economies including the European Union, Japan, and Vietnam. Sector-specific levies on steel, aluminum, and automobiles have further added to cost pressures.Analysts caution that these tariffs could fuel inflation over time, although current data indicates that the impact on consumer prices remains limited, and any broader effects are yet to fully materialise.","Retail spending in the US exceeded expectations in August, rising 0.6 percent month-on-month, government data showed on Tuesday.

Extended deadline for us operations

Why the US is concerned and wants China to divest?





TikTok users in the United States could be spared a potential closure following the Trump administration’s announcement of a framework agreement with China over the ownership of the popular social video platform.US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said on Monday in Madrid that President Donald Trump and Chinese Premier Xi Jinping will speak on Friday to potentially finalise the agreement. The plan aims to transition TikTok to American ownership.""The commercial terms have been agreed upon,"" Bessent said, without revealing specific details as the agreement involves private companies.China’s international trade representative Li Chenggang confirmed that both sides have reached a ""basic framework consensus"" on TikTok-related matters.Oracle Corp. is reportedly a potential buyer, though the company has not commented publicly.Chinese official Wang Jingtao said the parties agreed on handling TikTok’s algorithm usage rights and delegating US user data security to a partner.Despite lacking clear legal authority, Trump has repeatedly extended TikTok’s deadline to avoid US restrictions. The next deadline is September 17, giving more time for negotiations on American ownership.The US government’s concerns focus on ByteDance’s Chinese origins, particularly data handling and algorithm control, which have prompted legislative scrutiny under both Trump and Biden administrations.During his first term, Trump sought to ban TikTok, citing threats to U.S. national security. However, upon returning for a second term, he reversed course, signing an executive order on his first day in office to allow the app to continue operating.Under President Joe Biden, lawmakers and the administration continued to raise national security concerns, pushing for a U.S. ban on TikTok unless its Chinese parent company sold its controlling stake.TikTok continues to operate for its 170 million US users, with major tech companies supporting the platform while awaiting a final decision. Public opinion has shifted, with roughly one-third of Americans now backing a ban, down from 50 per cent in March 2023.Bottom line: While a preliminary deal offers TikTok a temporary reprieve, key details—including ownership structure and data oversight—will only become clear after the Trump–Xi discussion on Friday.",TikTok users in the United States could be spared a potential closure following the Trump administration’s announcement of a framework agreement with China.

US Tariff War: Donald Trump Blames Russian Oil Imports For India Action, Bessent Pushes EU Action





US treasury secretary Scott Bessent said on Monday that the Trump administration will not move ahead with new tariffs on Chinese goods over Beijing’s Russian oil purchases unless European countries impose steep duties of their own.Speaking in a joint interview with Reuters and Bloomberg, Bessent stressed that Washington expects Europe to take a stronger role in reducing Moscow’s oil revenues. “We expect the Europeans to do their share now, and we are not moving forward without the Europeans,” he said.Bessent noted that US President Donald Trump has already imposed an additional 25% tariff on Indian imports tied to Russian oil, and has urged European nations to introduce tariffs of 50% to 100% on China and India.He said he raised these points with Chinese officials during trade talks in Madrid, where the issue of TikTok was also discussed. According to Reuters, Chinese representatives insisted that oil purchases remain a “sovereign matter.”The treasury chief criticised some European states for continuing to buy Russian oil, while others import petroleum products refined in India from Russian crude. “I guarantee you that if Europe put on substantial secondary tariffs on the buyers of Russian oil, the war would be over in 60 or 90 days,” Bessent said, arguing that such measures would choke off Moscow’s main source of income.Trump has already said Europe’s sanctions are “not tough enough” and warned allies against fuelling Russia’s war economy. He has long pressed Nato partners to step up pressure on Beijing and New Delhi, although in recent weeks rhetoric towards India has softened as the US and India prepare for a new round of talks on Tuesday.Bessent claimed that the tariffs on Indian goods had already brought “substantial progress” in discussions with New Delhi.Meanwhile, he indicated Washington would work with European partners on tougher sanctions against Russian energy giants Rosneft and Lukoil, and explore using frozen Russian sovereign assets. Options include seizing small portions of the $300 billion in blocked funds or placing them in a special-purpose vehicle to back loans for Ukraine.The US and China recently reached a “basic framework consensus” on shifting ownership of TikTok from ByteDance to a US company, with leaders expected to discuss final terms later this week.",US treasury secretary Scott Bessent said on Monday that the Trump administration will not move ahead with new tariffs on Chinese goods over Beijing's Russian oil purchases.

India Coming to the Table: Donald Trump's Aide Peter Navarro’s Big Claim Ahead of Delhi Trade Talks





: In the hand tools section of the Ace Hardware store outside Washington DC, the medium-sized monkey wrench you check out is still priced $ 19.99. The price hasn’t changed in over a year, but the salesman warns that won’t last for long. Almost all hand tools coming into America are imported from China, India, and Vietnam, and Trump tariffs are certain to bump up the prices once the current inventory runs out, he says. The US just does make enough hand tools and some of the oldest manufacturers like CS Osborne, Wright Tools, and Klein Tools have struggled to survive the onslaught of cheaper foreign imports.Back in Mumbai, companies like Jyoti Steel and Taparia Tools, which makes stainless steel flat bars and pliers, wrenches and spanners respectively, have shipped off every tool, device, and implement they could rustle up before the Trump tariff kicked in. So much so that export figures actually ticked up in the April-May-June quarter. But the real pain will come soon, warns Pankaj Chadha, chaiman of the Engineering Export Promotion Council in India, particularly if there is no resolution to the 25 percent “Russian oil penalty” on top of the 25 percent tariff that the MAGA boss imposed on India.With 25 percent tariff, there was some chance to compete against Vietnam, which copped 19 percent. At 50 percent, no chance.Meanwhile, India’s pain isn’t going to result in any gain for the American consumer, who will pony up a tariff surcharge for the wrenches and spanners the US President has thrown in the works because the American importer and the retailer will pass on the higher cost to the buyer. US toolmakers, a dying breed, are not geared to produce to hand tools in the volume America needs, and even if they did, they wouldn’t be able to match the price of the imports even with the tariffs tagged on. Wait a couple of months, that’s when it will begin to bite, the hardware salesman chirps. And bite all around, says Chadha from Mumbai, whose organization is lobbying the Indian government for help. Businesses in both countries, indeed across natiions, are hurting.Which is why Trump minions are rushing around the world trying to sew up trade deals that are not really meeting the lofty expectations set up by the US President when he first threw a spanner in the works. Almost six months after he dropped the “Liberation Day” tariff bomb, it turns out that American consumers and producers are also experiencing the fallout, not just exporters across the world. The US media is replete with stories of granaries overflowing with unsold soybeans and corn that China has disdained, choosing to buy from Brazil after being hectored by Washington. Job numbers are down, Inflation is ticking up, and there is a discernible rise in prices that businesses say will become more evident in the months ahead.In fact, such is the adverse reaction across the world to the belligerent American tone that it is US mandarins who are now going around trying to wrap up trade deals rather than other foreign delegations trooping into Washington as they did in the initial weeks. This week, American negotiating teams are meeting their Chinese counterparts in Spain and Indian counterparts in New Delhi, even though US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said last week that Trump had invited India’s commerce minister to Washington DC. The Indian team did not turn up, so its the India pointman at the USTR, Brenden Lynch, the domain expert for all things commerce with India, who’s had to fly to New Delhi for talks.Not that it stopped Trump’s trade hitman Peter Navarro from gaslighting on the issue, claiming in a CNBC interview on Monday that India had reached out for talks. If anything, according to the Wall Street Journal, the US President got the cold shoulder from Modi after he began dissing New Delhi. In a story headlined Modi’s Strategy for Mending Ties With Trump: a Stiff Upper Lip, it cited an Indian official saying the US sought a leader-level phone call the week of July 28 to help break an impasse over trade, but India was reluctant.There are now growing signs that the US has shot itself in the foot with its tariff tantrums. Over the weekend, amid dismal job numbers, commerce secretary Lutnick said ‘The economy that Donald Trump owns starts at the end of this year.” On Tuesday, Trump called for ending quarterly earnings reports and switch to companies reporting every six months, because, he said, “ it will save money, and allow managers to focus on properly running their companies. ”Most striking was Trump's outreach to South Korea after his immigration enforcers had handcuffed and deported almost 400 South Korean workers from a Hyundai plant in Georgia for working with the wrong kind of visas, causing outrage in Seoul, where some of the returning workers swore never to return to the US. ""I don’t want to frighten off or disincentivize Investment into America by outside Countries or Companies. We welcome them, we welcome their employees, and we are willing to proudly say we will learn from them, and do even better than them at their own “game,” sometime into the not too distant future!” Trump wrote on Truth Social.","Almost all hand tools coming into America are imported from China, India, and Vietnam, and Trump tariffs are certain to bump up the prices.

US President Donald Trump has renewed his call to end quarterly earnings reports for publicly traded companies, suggesting instead a six-month reporting period to ease costs and allow executives to focus on running their businesses, AP reported.In a post on his social media platform Truth Social, Trump wrote, “This will save money, and allow managers to focus on properly running their companies.” He proposed that securities regulators review the existing three-month requirement, which the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has enforced since 1970.Trump first pushed for a review of quarterly reporting during his previous term, but no changes were implemented. The issue has gained renewed attention after the Long Term Stock Exchange, based in San Francisco, said last week it would petition the SEC to remove the quarterly mandate. The exchange lists companies prioritising long-term growth over short-term performance.Supporters of the shift argue that quarterly reporting is costly, time-consuming, and discourages companies from going public. They contend that frequent reporting can prompt executives to focus excessively on hitting short-term earnings targets rather than long-term strategic planning.Critics, however, emphasise that quarterly reports provide investors with timely financial information and help identify emerging risks, making them a key tool for transparency in public markets.","US President Donald Trump has renewed his call to end quarterly earnings reports for publicly traded companies.

Americans will be able to continue using TikTok, as a framework deal has been reached for the ownership of the social video platform, US treasury secretary Scott Bessent announced on Monday.The remarks came after weekend trade talks between the United States and China in Spain.Speaking at a press conference in Madrid, Bessent said that Trump and Chinese Premier Xi Jinping are speaking on Friday to potentially finalise the agreement.Bessent explained that the goal of the framework deal is to transfer TikTok’s ownership to US control. “We are not going to talk about the commercial terms of the deal,” he said.“It’s between two private parties. But the commercial terms have been agreed upon.”Chinese officials have not yet confirmed Bessent’s remarks and were absent from the press briefing, AP reported.The Madrid meeting marked the fourth round of trade talks since Trump launched tariffs on Chinese goods in April. Officials are now preparing for a possible Trump-Xi summit, though nothing has been confirmed. Analysts caution that potential trade hurdles could delay any visit.The issue of TikTok’s ownership has been politically charged in Washington.During Joe Biden’s Democratic presidency, both Congress and the White House invoked national security grounds to approve a US ban on the app unless its parent company, ByteDance, divested its controlling stake.Trump, however, has repeatedly extended the deadline for TikTok’s shutdown, despite legislation allowing only a single 90-day reprieve, and only if a deal and formal notification to Congress were in place.TikTok is one of more than 100 apps created by ByteDance, a company founded in 2012 by Chinese entrepreneur Zhang Yiming and headquartered in Beijing’s Haidian district. ByteDance first launched Douyin, a short-video app for China, in 2016, followed by TikTok for international markets. The company later acquired Musical.ly, a lip-syncing platform popular with Western teens, and merged it with TikTok, while keeping Douyin separate for Chinese users.The app quickly gained global popularity, becoming the first Chinese platform to achieve major success in Western markets. Unlike traditional social media platforms that focused on building user connections, TikTok’s algorithm recommended content tailored to individual interests.Its light-hearted videos and music clips earned it a reputation as a fun, authentic corner of the internet, and gave creators an opportunity to build audiences. TikTok was instrumental in launching the career of music artists such as Lil Nas X.The platform’s popularity soared during Covid-19 lockdowns, when viral dances became a cultural fixture. Competitors soon followed, with Instagram rolling out Reels and YouTube introducing Shorts to capture the short-form video trend. By then, TikTok was firmly established as a global sensation.But success brought scrutiny as US officials have voiced concerns about ByteDance’s Chinese origins, citing national laws that could compel companies to share data with the Beijing government. Another sticking point has been TikTok’s proprietary algorithm, which dictates what content users see.",US treasury secretary Scott Bessent announced that a framework deal has been reached for the ownership of the social video platform.

Investors are now focused on the Fed’s two-day meeting ending Wednesday, widely expected to deliver the first rate cut of 2025.Market watchers are paying close attention to Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s post-meeting press conference and updated projections for interest rates and economic growth, which could shape investor sentiment in the coming months.Political pressure adds another layer of uncertainty. President Donald Trump intensified his push for aggressive rate cuts, writing on his Truth Social account: “‘Too Late’ must cut interest rates now, and bigger than he had in mind.”Analysts say Trump’s comments could influence market expectations, even as concerns over inflation and a slowing US jobs market complicate the Fed’s decision-making. Treasury yields fell slightly, with the 10-year note down to 4.04% from 4.06%, reflecting expectations of monetary easing.Globally, France’s CAC 40 rose 1%, while other European and Asian indexes recorded more moderate gains, mirroring cautious optimism ahead of the Fed’s announcement. Analysts warn that higher inflation or a further slowdown in the labor market could curtail future rate cuts, potentially creating volatility for stocks that have already climbed on the assumption of easing.","The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 43 points, or 0.1%, while the Nasdaq rose 0.5% by 9:35 a.m. Eastern time.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"
E-commerce firm Udaan raises $340 million ahead of planned IPO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/e-commerce-firm-udaan-raises-340-million-ahead-of-planned-ipo/articleshow/105991030.cms,"

Stay informed with the latest business news, updates on bank holidays and public holidays.





Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain and boost vendor partnerships ahead of a stock market debut planned for 2025.The Series E round was done via a combination of fresh equity and conversion of debt, the Bangalore-based company said in a statement Thursday. The round was led by M&G Plc and existing investors including Lightspeed Venture Partners and DST Global participated.The round “fully funds our business plan,” Vaibhav Gupta, Udaan co-founder and chief executive officer, said in the statement. “It enables our continued journey of growth and profitability, positioning us well to be public-market ready in the next 12-18 months.”Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, runs an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business, though a very small part of India’s overall retail market, is expected to swell to $150 billion in sales in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co.The startup targets an initial public offering in 2025, though it’s yet to decide whether it will do so in India or overseas, Gupta told Bloomberg News last month.Udaan was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran the company until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021. The other two founders — Amod Malviya and Sujeet Kumar — are board members.","Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain.

E-Commerce startup Udaan to trim costs ahead of 2025 IPO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/e-commerce-startup-udaan-to-trim-costs-ahead-of-2025-ipo/articleshow/105001132.cms,"E-commerce startup Udaan is working to curb costs and forge new partnerships with consumer brands in India as it prepares to go public in 2025.Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta said in an interview. That’s set to happen around the same time as its initial public offering, he said.The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said. “Second, strategically we want to ensure that we are top of mind with shopkeepers, with big manufacturers, and we maintain our relative market share.”Lightspeed Venture Partners-backed Udaan is among startups trying to tap the rapid growth of India’s economy and consumer market, while meeting investor demands for profitability. Udaan, which at its peak employed thousands, joined fellow Indian startups in slashing jobs last year and tightening internal controls and compliance. It now has about 1,800 staff, and Gupta didn’t specify if further job cuts are needed.Corporate governance lapses at Indian online tutoring firm Byju’s, once the country’s top startup with a valuation of $22 billion, shone a light at unique challenges faced by founders in the South Asian nation and drove companies to be more diligent.“We continue to move towards more professionalized management, professionalized board and also institutionalized shareholders as we go towards public markets,” Gupta said.Udaan is yet to decide whether it will list in India or overseas.

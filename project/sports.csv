NEW DELHI: Carlos Alcaraz , the two-time defending champion, showcased his dominance at the ATP Indian Wells Masters on Wednesday. The world number three from Spain overcame the challenging windy conditions on Stadium Court to deliver a commanding performance against Grigor Dimitrov , defeating him 6-1, 6-1.Alcaraz's victory denied Dimitrov's bid to join Canadian Felix Auger-Aliassime as the only players to beat the Spaniard in three consecutive meetings.

NEW DELHI: Brazilian football legend Ronaldo , who is also a two-time World Cup winner, has withdrawn his intention to run for the presidency of the Brazilian Football Confederation (CBF) due to a lack of support from regional federations.In a social media post, the two-time Ballon d'Or winner stated that after publicly expressing his desire to become a candidate for the CBF presidency, he has officially withdrawn his intention.Ronaldo cited the lack of support from the majority of those with the power to decide as the reason for his withdrawal, stating that if they feel football is in good hands, his opinion does not matter.""After publicly declaring my desire to be a candidate for the presidency of the CBF during the next election, I'm officially withdrawing this intention. If the majority of those who have the power to decide feel that football is in good hands, it doesn't matter what I think,"" said Ronaldo.The 48-year-old had previously announced his intention to take the reins of the CBF in December, aiming to address what he perceived as a ""deep crisis"" in Brazilian football.However, Ronaldo revealed that 23 out of the 27 regional federations representing the various states of Brazil refused to listen to his proposals. Instead, they expressed their support for the re-election of the current CBF president, Ednaldo Rodrigues , in 2026.Rodrigues has faced criticism for his handling of the national team's coaching situation after Tite's departure following Brazil's quarter-final exit at the 2022 World Cup.Initially, Rodrigues pursued the appointment of Carlo Ancelotti, but the Italian coach ultimately decided to remain with Real Madrid. Eventually, Dorival Junior was appointed as the national team coach at the start of last year.Despite his illustrious career and desire to contribute to Brazilian football, Ronaldo's bid for the CBF presidency has been thwarted by the lack of support from the regional federations, who appear to favour the incumbent president's re-election.","Ronaldo has withdrawn his intention to run for the presidency of the Brazilian Football Confederation.

'Not going anywhere': Rohit Sharma on retirement from ODIs after winning the Champions Trophy

India win Champions Trophy title; Rohit Sharma confirms he's not retiring

Former Indian captain Dilip Vengsarkar expressed strong disapproval of the recent speculation surrounding Rohit Sharma 's retirement during the Champions Trophy . He emphasised that cricket legends like the current India captain should have autonomy in deciding their future.Rohit, 37, recently dismissed rumours about his retirement from ODI format after leading India to their second ICC title in nine months. However, he hasn't made any commitments regarding the 2027 ODI World Cup.""I am not an astrologer. A lot of matches to go till the 2027 World Cup. A lot will depend on his form and fitness. It is not fair to say anything at this stage but he has been outstanding as both captain and player. I don't know why people speculated (on his retirement), it's unwarranted. A player of his stature should get to decide about his future,"" Vengsarkar told PTI.Rohit's crucial batting performances in both the 2024 T20 World Cup and Champions Trophy proved valuable in challenging conditions. His aggressive approach in Dubai, particularly during the final against New Zealand, allowed other players to adapt to the slow pitch.""The way he has been playing all this time is nothing short of exemplary. He has got three double hundreds in ODI. What more do I say about him.""Guys like Virat and Rohit are big match players, bigger the platform the better the performance. It is very important from team's point of view. Their sheer presence is demoralising the opposition,"" said Vengsarkar, who is also a former chief selector who tracked both Rohit and Kohli in their early days.Rohit's success marks a significant turnaround from his previous struggles, which had led to him dropping himself from the final Test in Sydney.The team's victory was also supported by strong performances from Shreyas Iyer and KL Rahul on Dubai's slow pitches.""Iyer did very well but I am not happy the way he got out in the final. He should have continued till the very end and finished the game. But happy to see him realise his potential.""KL too played a few important innings at number six but still not convinced Axar Patel batting ahead of him at five. The left-hand right-hand combination could be the only reason.""Vengsarkar also acknowledged the selection committee's role in the team's success.""Credit needs to go to the selectors as well. They stuck with Rohit after the Australia series. Even the decision to take five spinners in the squad proved to be a master stroke.""","Former Indian captain Dilip Vengsarkar expressed strong disapproval of the recent speculation surrounding Rohit Sharma's retirement.

India win Champions Trophy title; Rohit Sharma confirms he's not retiring

NEW DELHI: As the Indian Premier League (IPL) 2025 approaches, Rajasthan Royals (RR) captain Sanju Samson has shared insights into his cherished bond with former Indian skipper MS Dhoni and expressed his excitement about RR's young sensation, Vaibhav Suryavanshi .In a candid conversation on JioHotstar‚Äôs 'SuperStar' program, Samson spoke about his admiration for Dhoni and how their relationship has evolved over the years. Dhoni, who will be playing in the 2025 IPL season for Chennai Super Kings (CSK) under new captain Ruturaj Gaikwad, continues to be a massive influence on young cricketers.""Like every young Indian cricketer, I always wanted to be around MS Dhoni,"" Samson said. ""Every time we played against CSK, I wanted to sit and talk to him, ask him how he does things. It was a dream for me.""Recalling a special moment from a match against CSK in Sharjah, Samson added, ""I remember playing a match against CSK in Sharjah, where I finally performed well, scored around 70-80 runs, won the game, and became the Man of the Match. After that, I met Mahi bhai, and since then, our relationship has grown. Even now, I meet him often. Just yesterday, I met him again. It's truly a blessed feeling--to go from idolising him to now sitting with him for shoots and events. I feel like I'm living my dream.""While reflecting on his bond with Dhoni, Samson also spoke highly of Vaibhav Suryavanshi, the 13-year-old prodigy who became the youngest signing in IPL history last year. Acquired by RR for Rs 1.1 crore during the mega-auction, Vaibhav has already showcased his talent on the domestic circuit. He made his first-class debut for Bihar at just 12 years old and has impressed with his fearless six-hitting ability.Speaking on the youngster‚Äôs potential, Samson remarked, ""For me, rather than giving advice, I prefer observing first--how a youngster wants to play his cricket, what he likes, and what kind of support he needs from me. Then, I work my way around that. Vaibhav looks very confident; he was hitting sixes out of the ground at the academy. People were already talking about his power-hitting. What else can you ask for?""Suryavanshi, who played for India U19 against Australia last year and smashed a 58-ball century, also impressed in the ACC Under-19 Asia Cup 2024-25, scoring 176 runs in five matches. Samson believes that nurturing his natural talent while maintaining a supportive environment will be crucial for the youngster‚Äôs development.""The key is to keep him in the best shape and provide a relaxed environment, which is something the Rajasthan Royals (RR) is known for,"" Samson said. ""We ensure a positive atmosphere in the dressing room and back our players. You never know--he might end up playing for India in a couple of years. I feel he is ready for the IPL. He looks capable of landing a few solid punches here and there. Let us see what the future holds.""","Rajasthan Royals (RR) captain Sanju Samson has shared insights into his cherished bond with former Indian skipper MS Dhoni.

Gill secured the prestigious honour after outshining Australia‚Äôs Steve Smith and New Zealand‚Äôs Glenn Phillips , thanks to his remarkable performances in One Day Internationals throughout the month.The top-order sensation has been in scintillating form, amassing 406 runs in just five ODIs at a staggering average of 101.50 and a strike rate of 94.19. His consistency and elegance at the crease were instrumental in India‚Äôs 3-0 series win over England, where he notched three consecutive half-centuries.Gill‚Äôs run began with a fluent 87 in Nagpur, followed by a composed 60 in Cuttack. He capped off the series with a masterclass in Ahmedabad, hammering 112 off 102 balls, decorated with 14 boundaries and three towering sixes. His century not only secured a comprehensive win but also earned him the Player of the Match and Player of the Series awards.Reflecting on his stellar month, Gill expressed his gratitude to the fans and his teammates, stating, ""It‚Äôs always special to contribute to the team‚Äôs success and to be recognised for it. My focus has always been on playing positively and making every opportunity count.""The accolades didn‚Äôt stop there for Gill, as he carried his blazing form into the ICC Champions Trophy 2025 . In India‚Äôs tournament opener against Bangladesh in Dubai, he struck an unbeaten 101, guiding India‚Äôs chase with class and composure. He followed that up with a gritty 46 against arch-rivals Pakistan, ensuring India remained unbeaten in their opening matches.Gill‚Äôs consistent performances throughout the Champions Trophy were pivotal in India‚Äôs triumph, as they went on to lift the coveted title last week. His exploits with the bat have cemented his position as the world‚Äôs top-ranked ODI batter, a spot he has firmly held since his prolific run in 2024.Teammate and captain Rohit Sharma also rose in the ICC ODI rankings, climbing two places to occupy the third position after his Player of the Match performance in the Champions Trophy final.This is the third time that Shubman Gill has bagged the ICC Men‚Äôs Player of the Month award, having previously won it twice in 2023 - in January and September. His consistency and hunger for runs make him one of the brightest stars in world cricket, and his current form suggests that he is far from done.","Shubman Gill named ICC Men's Player of the Month for February 2025.

Hardik Pandya: 'I know our father is watching us and blessing us'

NEW DELHI: India all-rounder Hardik Pandya finally lifted the ICC Champions Trophy eight years after his valiant knock went in vain against Pakistan in the 2017 final. That night, a young Pandya smashed a blistering 76 off 43 balls, but India fell to a crushing 180-run defeat. Pandya found redemption in 2025, playing a crucial role in the death overs with an 18 off 18 that helped secure India‚Äôs victory.Reflecting on his journey, Pandya admitted that the memory of 2017 had always lingered.""2017, the work was left. You know I could not finish the job back then. And I am very, very glad that tonight is the night where I can say that you know what, I am a Champions Trophy winner as well. So, sounds good I think,"" Hardik was quoted as saying by ICC after winning the coveted title, his face beaming with satisfaction.While celebrating the triumph, Pandya remained determined and ambitious. The victory is just another milestone on his quest for greatness, as he openly expressed his desire to bring home more titles.""For me, it has always been about winning as many championships as I can. I did say when we won in 2024 that this is not done, I still need 5-6 more trophies there. I am very happy that one more is added,"" Pandya said, reiterating his drive to secure more silverware for India.The 2024 ICC Men‚Äôs T20 World Cup victory and now the Champions Trophy have fueled his hunger for more achievements, and Pandya is far from satisfied. As one of the senior players and a leader within the squad, he takes immense pride in how his team performed collectively to seal the win.""The most important thing in my life and my cricketing journey has always been about how I can make sure that my team can win,"" he emphasised, reflecting on his growth as a cricketer and a leader.With India already looking ahead to the ICC Men‚Äôs T20 World Cup 2026 on home soil, Pandya has set his next goal. As defending champions, the Men in Blue will look to maintain their dominance in familiar conditions.""I love wins like this where everyone comes there, puts their heart out and you know I think this was for India, this was for Bharat. The Champions Trophy is done, next goal ICC T20 World Cup in India, lifting the cup,"" Pandya declared, exuding confidence and passion.","India all-rounder Hardik Pandya finally lifted the ICC Champions Trophy eight years after his valiant knock went in vain against Pakistan in the 2017 final.

NEW DELHI: Atletico Madrid coach Diego Simeone questioned the decision to rule out Julian Alvarez's penalty during his team's Champions League defeat by Real Madrid on Wednesday.The match ended 2-2 on aggregate, with Los Blancos winning 4-2 in a dramatic penalty shootout after Alvarez slipped while taking his shot. The penalty was disallowed after a VAR review for a supposed double touch on the ball.Simeone expressed his pride in his team's performance, despite the controversial penalty decision. ""But beyond that, which now just serves to argue about whether it should have counted or not, I am proud of my players, I am happy, truly,"" he said. He acknowledged that they couldn‚Äôt defeat Real Madrid but added, ""They had a really bad time (against us) again.""The Atletico coach further questioned the VAR decision , stating, ""The referee said when Julian got to the penalty spot he touched the ball with his standing foot, but the ball did not move."" He added that he wanted to believe the officials made the right call but asked the media, ""Raise your hand, anyone who saw Julian touch it twice, who is going to raise their hand? Nobody has raised their hand,"" he shouted.Real Madrid's Thibaut Courtois , however, felt that Alvarez had indeed touched the ball twice. ""In the end it's a lottery, I felt a little that he had touched it twice, that's what I told the referee. It is clearly not easy to see, but it's a bit of bad luck for them there,"" Courtois explained.The Belgian goalkeeper criticised Atletico's complaints about the decision, while also commenting on his own club‚Äôs previous attacks on Spanish refereeing. ""I think UEFA saw it clearly ‚Äì I'm sick of this victimhood, always crying about stuff like this,"" Courtois said. ""The refs don't want to help particular teams, not in Spain, not in Europe.""Real Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti also supported the VAR decision. ""They detected it.

TimesofIndia.com

NEW DELHI: ‚ÄúSUNIL CHHETRI IS BACK,‚Äù announced the All India Football Federation (AIFF) on their official X (formerly Twitter) account almost a week ago. The all-caps post of Chhetri's return included an Indian flag and a message: ‚ÄúThe captain, leader, legend will return to the Indian national team for the FIFA International Window in March.‚ÄùWhat followed was a storm of reactions ‚Äî of all kinds ‚Äî across social media, with many understandably delighted to see the return of Indian football ‚Äôs golden boy; others questioned the value of the long-form tributes written after his retirement, wondering what they meant now.While some saw it as a glimmer of hope in a bleak phase for Indian football, others asked some pressing questions: Why hasn‚Äôt Indian football produced another Sunil Chhetri ? Why couldn't India develop a worthy successor while Chhetri was still on the field? In a country of 1.4 billion, is that too much to ask?‚ÄúThere was a time when people wondered who could replace Bhaichung Bhutia. Eventually, we found a successor in Sunil. And similarly, Sunil too will be replaced, but it will take time. Everyone just needs to be patient,"" said Mehtab Hossain, former India international with 30 caps, many of them alongside Chhetri, in an exclusive chat with""If you look at countries in Africa or South America ‚Äî excluding Europe, many of them barely have proper infrastructure or even food security. But look at their football,"" he added. ‚ÄúOur government needs to step up to develop Indian football. It‚Äôs not enough to make lofty claims like having a vision for 2045 or 2050. It‚Äôs not about talking ‚Äî it‚Äôs about doing.""Chhetri, for his part, has kept mum on his dramatic return to the international fold.But the theory doing the rounds is that Indian football's poor run ‚Äî no wins in five matches since his retirement ‚Äî has fueled his comeback.‚ÄúWhen he announced his retirement, my first thought was that he‚Äôd had a beautiful career, and it was time for him to move on. I wished him the best,‚Äù recalled Robin Singh, Chhetri‚Äôs former teammate, who scored four goals in 24 appearances for India.Both Robin and Mehtab have seen Sunil's rise, fall and rise again through different phases of his career. And both believe his return can only help Indian football.‚ÄúI'm excited to see him play at the highest level again for the national team. Hopefully, he can carry over the form he‚Äôs shown in the league this season and replicate that for the country,‚Äù said Robin, referencing Chhetri‚Äôs 12-goal haul from 24 matches in the 2024/25 Indian Super League season ‚Äî second-best among all scorers in India's top-tier competition.Now 40, Chhetri is set to once again don the India jersey when the team faces Maldives on March 19, ahead of the AFC Asian Cup Qualification third-round clash against Bangladesh on March 25.And if he finds the net, it could take him a step closer to joining an elite club in world football ‚Äî players with 100 international goals.Currently with a tally of 94 goals, Chhetri is in line to join the likes of legends Cristiano Ronaldo Lionel Messi and Ali Daei -- the only three players to have achieved the feat.Considering all the aspects, Chhetri‚Äôs return is an intriguing subplot for football fans across the globe.‚ÄúI‚Äôm very happy because after Sunil‚Äôs departure, the Indian team hasn‚Äôt delivered great results. His return comes at the right time,‚Äù 39-year-old Mehtab remarked. ‚ÄúMaybe he won‚Äôt be at his peak anymore, but the leadership he brings can still lift the squad. Without Sunil, who‚Äôs the idol in this team now? He came back for the country ‚Äî otherwise, there was no reason for him to return.‚ÄùYet, the question persists: If not Chhetri, then who?‚ÄúI think the responsibility doesn‚Äôt lie with just one person or even just the national team. It‚Äôs up to the entire football fraternity to believe in the younger generation ‚Äî players like Manvir Singh, Lallianzuala Chhangte, Vikram Partap Singh and Rahim Ali ‚Äî who‚Äôve shown they can be versatile,"" Robin opined.

Seven medical professionals faced trial on Tuesday for homicide charges related to their treatment of Argentine football icon Diego Maradona before his death.Maradona passed away on November 25, 2020, at age 60, whilst recovering from brain surgery at home. He had struggled with cocaine and alcohol dependencies for decades.The accused face potential prison sentences of eight to 25 years if found guilty of ""homicide with possible intent"", for allegedly continuing treatment despite knowing it could result in the footballer's death.Supporters gathered outside the courthouse on Tuesday, displaying banners demanding justice and singing tributes to their fallen hero.Veronica Ojeda, mother of Maradona's young son Dieguito, tearfully thanked the assembled crowd. His daughters, Dalma and Gianinna, entered silently.The prosecution presented their opening statement, promising substantial evidence that the medical team failed in their duties during Maradona's final days.Prosecutor Patricio Ferrari displayed a photograph of Maradona post-mortem, showing him supine with a distended abdomen.Maradona was discovered lifeless two weeks after surgery in a leased residence in an upscale Buenos Aires area, where he stayed after hospital discharge.Medical examination revealed death from cardiac failure and acute pulmonary oedema.

The trial, featuring nearly 120 witnesses, is expected to continue until July.The defendants include various medical professionals.

NEW DELHI: The incident in southwestern Congo, where a boat capsized resulting in the loss of 25 lives, primarily football players, highlights the prevalent issue of maritime safety in the region.The players were returning from a match in Mushie city, Ma√Ø-Ndombe province, when the vessel overturned on the Kwa River on Sunday night. Alexis Mputu, the provincial spokesman, suggested that poor visibility at night may have contributed to the accident.While at least 30 individuals survived the incident, as confirmed by Renacle Kwatiba, the local administrator of Mushie territory, such tragic occurrences are not uncommon in the central African country.Overcrowded vessels and late-night travels are frequently cited as contributing factors, exacerbated by the lack of enforcement of maritime regulations by the authorities.Congo's vast network of rivers serves as a crucial means of transportation for its over 100 million inhabitants, particularly in remote areas where infrastructure is inadequate or non-existent.Regrettably, hundreds of lives have been lost in boat accidents in recent years, as more people resort to wooden vessels packed with passengers and goods, abandoning the few available roads.The incident underscores the pressing need for improved maritime safety measures, including stricter enforcement of regulations, better vessel maintenance, and awareness campaigns to promote responsible travel practices.Addressing these issues is crucial to prevent further loss of life and ensure the safe transportation of people and goods across Congo's waterways.","The players were returning from a match in Mushie city, Ma√Ø-Ndombe province, when the vessel overturned on the Kwa River.

NEW DELHI: Holger Rune delivered one of the most jaw-dropping moments of Indian Wells 2025 on Tuesday, hitting a between-the-legs winner to save break point en route to a straight-sets victory over Stefanos Tsitsipas . But as thrilled as the crowd was, Rune was just as excited ‚Äî at least until he saw the replay.""You know, I kind of had the expectation that I looked like Roger Federer when I hit it, and I didn't quite do that,"" Rune said with a laugh after his 6-4, 6-4 win. ""So that was disappointing.""The 21-year-old Dane‚Äôs flashy shot wasn‚Äôt just for show ‚Äî it helped him knock off the world No. 9 and book a spot in the Indian Wells quarterfinals for the second consecutive year.It also marked Rune‚Äôs first quarterfinal appearance of 2025, a year that hasn‚Äôt quite lived up to expectations for the former world No. 4.After bursting onto the scene in 2022 with a memorable win over Novak Djokovic at the Paris Masters, Rune has struggled to maintain consistency, slipping to 13th in the rankings while contemporaries like Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner continue to climb.Still, Rune is staying focused, emphasising growth over frustration.""It's about making results, but at the same time improving your game and having stability,"" he said. ""Because I don't believe I have become the worse player the last two years. I actually think the opposite. I think I have become a better all-around player.""He admits falling short of expectations can sting. ""You know, when you have these expectations and you don't quite, like, live up to them, of course it's disappointing,"" he said.""But it's very basic and maybe it's very boring to say it, but I just love tennis .""So even not being satisfied with my results, I still love to go down to the practice court and hit forehands, backhands, work on my shots, my physicality ...

Indian Wells: Defending champion Iga Swiatek edged closer to an unprecedented third straight Indian Wells WTA title Sunday, overwhelming Dayana Yastremska 6-0, 6-2 to reach the fourth round.Swiatek's 65-minute victory set the tone on a day that saw Daniil Medvedev spend just 10 minutes on court before ailing opponent Alex Michelsen retired.Swiatek, the world number two from Poland, was in full control against hard-hitting Ukrainian Yastremska, swinging freely as she won the first 10 games.She converted six of her 11 break chances and didn't face a break point herself and it was virtually over by the time Yastremska got on the board with wins in her last two service games.""It's always hard to finish a match like that,"" Swiatek said. ""But I'm happy that I got my intensity up the last game and closed it with confidence.""Swiatek next faces Czech Karolina Muchova , who trailed 3-5 in the first set but won 10 of the next 11 games to beat compatriot Katerina Siniakova 7-5, 6-1.Russian 17-year-old Mirra Andreeva and 2023 Indian Wells champion Elena Rybakina joined Swiatek in dishing out bagels as they lined up a fourth-round clash.Andreeva, who triumphed in Dubai last month to become the youngest ever winner of a WTA 1000 event , beat Denmark's Clara Tauson 6-3, 6-0 in 63 minutes.Rybakina downed Britain's Katie Boulter 6-0, 7-5.Andreeva -- who beat Tauson in the final in Dubai -- said she found conditions on Stadium Court tougher than she made it look.""I'm just happy the way I managed to stay in the game,"" she said. ""I didn't give her much rhythm so I guess it was not bad -- but there's a lot of things to work on.""Women's fourth seed Jessica Pegula of the United States, fresh off her first WTA title of the year in Austin, was another quick winner, putting away China's Wang Xinyu 6-2, 6-1 in just 62 minutes.Pegula next faces Ukraine's Elina Svitolina, a 6-2, 6-4 winner over Danielle Collins.Medvedev headlined the men's lineup in the combined ATP Masters and WTA 1000 event, but he was barely underway when 20-year-old Michelson retired because of illness after dropping the first two games.""Food poisoning or something like this, these things happen,"" said Medvedev, who was headed to the practice courts to tune up for a fourth-round clash with 10th-seeded American Tommy Paul.Paul beat Britain's 2021 Indian Wells winner Cameron Norrie, now ranked 77th in the world, 6-3, 7-5.Eighth-seeded Stefanos Tsitsipas, coming off his first title in almost a year in Dubai, beat Matteo Berrettini 6-3, 6-3 in a rematch of their Dubai quarter-final last week.Tsitsipas dropped just eight points on his serve as he wrong-footed Italian with a variety of athletic shots, breaking him three times on the way to victory in 68 minutes.After months in the doldrums Tsitsipas said he was relishing a new mental approach to the game.""I just feel like I want to get out there on the court and be a gladiator, and that's how I approach every single match I get to play,"" he said.Tallon Griekspoor , the world No. 43 from the Netherlands who shocked world number two and top seed Alexander Zverev in the second round, backed up his big win with a 7-6 (7/3), 6-3 victory over France's 29th seed Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard.Griekspoor fired 10 aces, dominating the first set tiebreaker, and didn't face a break point in the second set.Griekspoor needed an hour and 16 minutes to secure the win, but in a season in which dropping the first set has become an alarming habit that was fast enough.""It feels nice to win a match in under one and a half hour,"" he said.","Defending champion Iga Swiatek beats Dayana Yastremska 6-0, 6-2 to reach fourth round. Daniil Medvedev wins just 10 minutes on court before ailing opponent Alex Michelsen retires.

Former world number one Novak Djokovic , who has won the Indian Wells ATP Masters five times, suffered a surprising defeat in his opening match on Saturday, going down to lucky loser Botic van de Zandschulp, while reigning champion Carlos Alcaraz progressed to the next round.The 24-time Grand Slam champion Djokovic lost 6-2, 3-6, 6-1.""No excuses for a poor performance,"" the Serb said after the match. ""It doesn't feel great when you play this way on the court. But congratulations to my opponent -- just a bad day in the office, I guess, for me.""Van de Zandschulp has established a notable record against the big guns.His impressive victories include a remarkable win against Alcaraz at the US Open in the previous year, followed by a triumph over Rafael Nadal in Davis Cup, which turned out to be the Spanish legend's final professional match.""I think I kept my cool during the whole match,‚Äù said van de Zandschulp. ""I know if I go into the match and lose my cool, especially against the big players, it's going to be a really tough day. That's always one thing I'm trying to do well.""Djokovic reduced his unforced errors significantly in the second set, compared to his 14 mistakes in the first set and swiftly secured a service break, establishing a 3-0 advantage.He celebrated with a fist pump after striking a powerful forehand winner to the corner, earning his first break opportunity of the contest.Despite the intense exchanges continuing throughout, Djokovic's visible signs of frustration emerged occasionally. Although he lost his serve while attempting to close out the set, he succeeded in his subsequent service game, delivering a powerful forehand winner to the baseline to make it an even contest.But the momentum shift proved temporary. Zandschulp maintained consistent pressure through both baseline play and net approaches, as Djokovic's error count increased steadily.Zandschulp gained the upper hand with a break for 3-1, subsequently winning five consecutive games as Djokovic struggled to halt his opponent's progress.Djokovic exit followed a similar shock suffered by world number two Alexander Zverev and fourth-seeded Casper Ruud.The tournament's landscape has shifted dramatically, with world number three Alcaraz emerging as the highest-ranked player remaining, particularly notable given world number one Jannik Sinner's absence due to a three-month drugs suspension.Alcaraz, pursuing a remarkable achievement of three consecutive Indian Wells titles - a feat only accomplished by Djokovic and Roger Federer - commenced his title defence impressively, defeating France's Quentin Halys 6-4, 6-2.The Spanish player secured an early advantage to claim the opening set, before establishing a commanding 4-0 lead in the second set with impressive serving.His dominant display included seven aces and successful defence of the sole break point faced, concluding the match efficiently in 67 minutes.""I was nervous at the beginning of the match,"" he told a supportive crowd. ""The first match is never easy so I was trying to be focused on my game.""I just tried to be relaxed, as relaxed as I can. Can always be better, but I'm ready for the (next) round and excited.""Australian Open winner Madison Keys began proceedings at the combined ATP Masters and WTA 1000 tournament, defeating Russia's Anastasia Potapova 6-3, 6-0 in her first appearance since claiming her first Grand Slam title.Her performance was sharp as she overcame Potapova in 63 minutes.In other early contests, American players Taylor Fritz and Coco Gauff progressed to the next round.Fritz, who won the men's title in 2022, beat Italian qualifier Matteo Gigante 7-5, 6-3, while Gauff -- also seeded third in her section -- secured a hard-fought 6-3, 3-6, 7-6 (7/4) win against Japan's Moyuka Uchijima.","Former world number one Novak Djokovic suffers shock defeat at Indian Wells.

The world No.30, who clinches 89 percent of his service games, has saved 70 percent of breakpoints and averages 18 aces per match, is looking to put the blush on the receiver.Agreed that the serve is but one shot in matchups that are likely to test different tools, but Mpetshi Perricard's serve makes for a compelling case.""You need to accept that you can miss,'' he says. ""I'm aggressive, I'm near the limit. But you have to prepare yourself, be ready that you may miss a lot of times.""""And you can succeed a lot of times too.""As much as his serves appear to manifest everything that is out of control -- a hailstorm, a howling tempest - control is a big part of his motion.

""I have a lot to improve,"" he said about his game. ""I have to be better with my movement, my backhand... When my serve doesn't make the point, I have to be very good when I play backhand or forehand.""Mpetshi Perricard started out playing a two-handed backhand, but switched to the single-hander at nine years of age. ""I felt more confident with the one-handed backhand,"" he said.Tennis has been the way forward for Mpetshi Perricard and his younger sister Daphnee, who is on the junior Tour. In his player bio on the ATP website, he lists his mother as his hero.

World No. 2 Alexander Zverev , who suffered a defeat against Tallon Griekspoor in his Indian Wells opener, admitted that his ""terrible"" performance has pushed any thoughts of overtaking Jannik Sinner in the rankings out of his mind.Zverev entered the prestigious ATP Masters event in the California desert as the top seed, taking advantage of world No. 1 Sinner‚Äôs belated three-month suspension for a doping violation.Having finished as the runner-up to Sinner at the Australian Open, Zverev initially saw an opportunity to claim the top spot. However, with his current struggles on the court, that ambition is quickly fading.""Now it's less, because I'm just playing terrible,"" said Zverev, who made early exits at Buenos Aires, Rio de Janeiro and Acapulco before his disastrous Indian Wells showing.He became the first men's top seed at Indian Wells to crash out in the opening round since Andy Murray in 2017.""I have to find my game before thinking about that, because to become world number one you have to win tournaments,"" Zverev said.""I'm not past getting first, second round at the moment. So I need to figure that out first.""Zverev admitted he had no clear explanation for his dip in form since the Australian Open.Before the tournament, he had cited illness during two of the three weeks of his ""rough South American swing"" as a possible factor.However, after his 4-6, 7-6 (7/5), 7-6 (7/4) loss to 43rd-ranked Griekspoor‚Äîwho had been defeated in six of their previous seven meetings‚ÄîZverev conceded that he was simply not playing well enough.""I'm not playing a level that I want to play, definitely not playing anywhere near what I played in Australia,"" he said.After taking the first set against Griekspoor, Zverev staged a comeback from 2-5 down in the second to lead 6-5, only to be broken while serving for the match.In the third set, he saved five match points in the 12th game and converted his fifth break point to push the contest into a decisive tiebreak. However, he could not hold off Griekspoor any longer, ultimately falling short.""He played a good match,"" Zverev said. ""There's no question about that. But I have to look at myself a little bit.""""It's everything,"" he said.

Brazilian rising star Joao Fonseca demonstrated resilience by overcoming a third-set deficit to defeat British player Jacob Fearnley 6-2, 1-6, 6-3 on Thursday at Indian Wells .The teenager, who earned his place in history as the 10th-youngest ATP Tour winner with his victory at the Argentina Open in February, said: ""Today was petty difficult, a lot of windy, but I got through. Beginning of the match I played really well and he was making some mistakes.

Exclusive | Arjuna Awardee Vantika Agrawal: 'People still ask, 'Chess is fine, but what do you really do?''

NEW DELHI: Former Asian Games bronze-winner in volleyball and the father of badminton superstar PV Sindhu, PV Ramana, offers a balanced perspective on the debate surrounding the challenges of pursuing sports in India, particularly for middle-class families.Ramana's own journey, from a lower-middle-class background to becoming the parent of a two-time Olympic medalist Sindhu, serves as an instance of opportunities that sports can provide.""My father died when I was 3, I was the youngest of 10 siblings. But my elder brothers and sisters, they were so happy to support me and see me play national-level volleyball, why? Because I got a Railways job because of that sport,"" he told PTI. ""So, if you are lower middle-class or middle-class, being good in any sport actually opens up opportunities for you. Not to forget, sport is great for a child's overall development.""While acknowledging the challenges, Ramana emphasises the importance of finding a balance between sports and academics.""Talent always reveals itself and is never a prisoner of wealth. As a parent, you have to find the balance. When I realised my elder daughter was academically inclined, I encouraged her to pursue that,"" he said. ""With Sindhu, she was way ahead of everyone on the badminton court by the time she entered 10th standard in school. She had found sponsors because everyone could see she was destined for big things. We should trust the children too. They also have instincts. I don't think as a sportsperson, one should discourage others from sports.""Ramana believes that talent is not confined to wealth and that parents should trust their children's instincts and abilities and should not discourage them from taking up sports.""Getting a job through sport is one of the major considerations for middle-class parents and from what I know, there are plenty of opportunities. Railways itself is hiring thousands of athletes,"" he added. ""Also, being good in sports gets you admission in premier educational institutions through sports quota. It is the responsibility of the coaches to guide young players through proper notification of job openings and other opportunities. All academies should be doing this.""Furthermore, Ramana stresses the role of coaches in guiding young players through proper notification of job openings and other opportunities.""We should never forget that minimum graduation is required for an athlete too (to find a decent job). These days, there is quota in jobs for retired athletes as well,"" he added. ""So, don't discourage, let the child flow. In my view, they should be encouraged to find balance and pay attention to academics also because you are not training the entire day. There is time for other things.""""During Sindhu's formative years, there were days she would ask me how was it that some kids in her training travel by air while we always took the train. But look at her now,"" Ramana said.""Struggle will be there but you have to be prepared.""",PV Ramana is the father of two-time Olympic medalist PV Sindhu.

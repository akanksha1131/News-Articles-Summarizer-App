Keep calm and carry on: India’s mantra for U-19 World Cup final,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/keep-calm-and-carry-on-indias-mantra-for-u-19-world-cup-final/articleshow/127970000.cms,"Image credit: BCCI

Why this T20 World Cup could well see a 300 plus total | Will India create history?

India walk into the U-19 World Cup final against England in Harare with a sense of calm that feels almost provocative in restraint. In a tournament often coloured by hype and destiny-talk, this team under captain Ayush Mhatre has chosen a different style: of neutrality, clarity and assurance.If Aaron George’s words are an indication, this is not a team obsessed with grand plans or emotional crescendos. “There are no grand sermons and lectures. Under coach (Hrishikesh) Kanitkar sir, we believe in staying neutral and having clarity in our roles,” Aaron, centurion in the semifinal on Wednesday, told TOI.Friday will mark India’s sixth straight appearance in a U-19 World Cup final, a streak that began in 2016. This will be their 10th final at this level, four more than the next-best, Australia. “There is pressure, but I don’t see it as a burden,” he noted.Aaron’s classy 115 against Afghanistan in the semifinal stands as the third-highest score by a batter in the knockout stages of an U-19 World Cup, behind only Nicholas Pooran’s 143 in 2014 and Cheteshwar Pujara’s 129 in 2006.“It was the refusal to see it as anything other than the next ball that needs to be played,” he spoke of the match-winning knock.“There is no elaborate blueprint for the final,” Aaron says. Conditions are familiar enough, but India are comfortable letting the pitch “reveal itself”. Preparation has been rooted in repetition rather than prediction, on building muscle memory. George admitted that the summit clash brings challenges you cannot rehearse.“You can prepare for hours at the nets, but the match throws unique challenges you cannot prepare for. That is where presence of mind, instinct and honesty to process take over,” Aaron elaborates.Away from the tactical talk, the grounding influences are telling. “I listen to R&B and hip-hop to unwind,” he said. Faith, prayer and routine helps him stay centred. “I’m not God fearing, but God loving.” There is ambition too. Aaron speaks of wanting to be a three-format player for India.Pressure, Aaron acknowledges, never disappears. “The difference is learning to coexist. This final is being treated not as an extraordinary event, but as another game that demands discipline and calm. We will give our 100%,” he added.England, hardened by high-intensity contests, will test that calm.","India face England in the U-19 World Cup final in Harare on Friday.

WPL Auction: Delhi Capitals co-owner Parth Jindal on women's cricket after India's World Cup win

Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) won their second Women’s Premier League (WPL) title after beating Delhi Capitals (DC) by six wickets in the final on Thursday in Vadodara, completing a record chase with two balls to spare. It was another disappointing end for Delhi Capitals, who were playing their fourth straight final in as many seasons and again finished runners-up.Chasing 204, RCB were led by captain Smriti Mandhana, who scored 87 off 41 balls, and Georgia Voll, who made 79 off 54 deliveries. The pair added 165 runs for the second wicket, a partnership that decided the contest. With this win, RCB drew level with Mumbai Indians (MI) as the most successful teams in the WPL.Delhi Capitals had earlier posted 203 for four after being asked to bat. Skipper Jemimah Rodrigues top-scored with 57 off 37 balls, anchoring the innings after Shafali Varma and Lizelle Lee provided a strong start. Chinelle Henry provided the late push with 35 off just 15 balls. Laura Wolvaardt remained unbeaten on 44 off 25 balls, while Lizelle Lee made 37 off 30 deliveries. Shafali Verma also contributed at the top before falling in the powerplay.RCB began well with the ball, as Lauren Bell and Sayali Satghare conceded only nine runs in the first three overs. The pressure eased in the fourth over when Lee struck Satghare for two sixes. That over also included a stumping appeal created by Richa Ghosh and a difficult caught-and-bowled chance that Satghare could not hold. Delhi reached 36 after five overs.Arundhati Reddy was brought into the attack and removed Shafali Verma with a short ball, which was taken by Ghosh behind the stumps. Wolvaardt and Lee then increased the scoring, with Lee taking on Shreyanka Patil for two fours and a six as Delhi moved to 72 for one in seven overs. Nadine de Klerk broke the partnership by dismissing Lee, who was caught by Grace Harris running in from long-on.Rodrigues and Wolvaardt added 76 runs for the next wicket, keeping the innings on track. Henry’s late hitting ensured Delhi crossed the 200 mark.In reply, RCB lost Grace Harris early for nine, but Mandhana and Voll kept the chase under control. They scored freely through the middle overs and reached 100 at the halfway stage, needing 104 from 60 balls. Mandhana brought up her fifty in 23 balls and continued to find boundaries, while Voll matched her at the other end.RCB reached 150 in the 14th over, needing 54 from 36 balls. Voll was dismissed by Minnu Mani, briefly giving Delhi hope, but RCB stayed calm and finished the chase. The result meant RCB once again defeated Delhi Capitals in a final, repeating the outcome of the 2024 title match.","Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) won their second Women’s Premier League (WPL) title after beating Delhi Capitals (DC) by six wickets in the final on Thursday in Vadodara.

NEW DELHI: The Women’s Premier League has quickly established itself as a landmark tournament in women’s cricket, delivering high-quality competition, packed stadiums and memorable finals since its inception in 2023. In just four editions, the league has already produced a clear pattern of dominance, heartbreak and recurring rivalries.

Led by a balanced squad and strong leadership of Harmanpreet Kaur, MI defeated Delhi Capitals in the final, beginning a trend that would see DC repeatedly fall short on the biggest stage.Royal Challengers Bengaluru broke through in 2024, claiming their maiden WPL title by once again denying Delhi Capitals in the final. That defeat marked DC’s second straight runner-up finish, reinforcing their reputation as one of the most consistent teams without silverware.Mumbai Indians returned to the summit in 2025, lifting their second trophy and reaffirming their status as a powerhouse in the competition. For Delhi Capitals, the disappointment deepened as they finished runners-up for the third time in as many finals.The 2026 season followed a familiar script. Royal Challengers Bengaluru, inspired by captain Smriti Mandhana , lifted their second WPL title with a commanding six-wicket win over Delhi Capitals in the final. Mandhana’s magnificent 87 off 41 balls, combined with Georgia Voll’s fluent 79 in a record 165-run stand, powered RCB to a memorable chase of 203.

WPL Auction 2026: Full Breakdown of Every Major Number

NEW DELHI: The winners of the Women’s Premier League 2026 final walked away with a huge prize cheque of Rs 6 crore, underlining the league’s growing financial stability and consistency at the top level of women’s franchise cricket. The amount mirrors the prize money awarded to Mumbai Indians after their title triumph in the 2025 edition, reinforcing the BCCI ’s commitment to maintaining strong incentives for excellence in the women’s game.Royal Challengers Bengaluru, who defeated Delhi Capitals by six wickets in a high-scoring final on Thursday, pocketed the Rs 6 crore prize after clinching their second WPL title. The runners-up, Delhi Capitals, once again fell short on the biggest stage despite reaching their fourth successive final, but still earned a significant financial reward for their campaign.RCB’s title win was built around a dominant batting display in a pressure chase. Captain Smriti Mandhana led from the front with a sublime 87 off 41 balls, while Georgia Voll produced a match-defining 79 off 54 deliveries. Their 165-run partnership for the second wicket laid the foundation for a record chase, as RCB overhauled Delhi’s imposing 203 for four with two balls to spare.Delhi Capitals had earlier posted a formidable total after Jemimah Rodrigues struck a fluent 57 off 37 balls and Chinelle Henry added late impetus with a rapid 35 off just 15 deliveries.Laura Wolvaardt and Lizelle Lee also chipped in with valuable contributions, but the total ultimately proved insufficient against RCB’s relentless response.With this victory, RCB joined Mumbai Indians as the most successful teams in the history of the Women’s Premier League, both having won multiple titles. The unchanged prize money from 2025 to 2026 reflects the league’s steady commercial footing rather than short-term inflation, a sign of structured growth rather than volatility.The Rs 6 crore purse not only rewards the champions but also highlights the WPL’s stature as one of the most lucrative domestic tournaments in women’s cricket. As the league continues to mature, the consistency in prize money and the quality of high-pressure finals point towards a sustainable model that continues to elevate the profile, competitiveness and earning potential of women cricketers in India and beyond.Also Visit: England Under-19 vs India Under-19 Final: Match Details, Teams, Date and Venue",Royal Challengers Bengaluru pocketed the Rs 6 crore prize after clinching their second WPL title.

ISPL | Tiigers of Kolkata post season-record 136 in biggest win of the tournament

Tiigers of Kolkata entered the final of the Indian Street Premier League (ISPL) Season 3 with a four-wicket victory over the Ahmedabad Lions in Qualifier 2, riding on a dominant bowling effort followed by a composed, if nervy, run chase at Lalbhai Contractor Stadium on Thursday.Earlier, the Tiigers produced a clinical performance with the ball to restrict Ahmedabad to 72/9 in their allotted 10 overs. The Lions were on the back foot early after losing both openers inside the powerplay.Sikandarbhai Bhatti scored 8 off 7 balls before being caught by Saroj Pramanik off Firdos Alam in the second over. Alam struck again soon after, trapping Prathamesh Thakre lbw for 11, leaving Ahmedabad struggling at 11/2.Ashiq Ali Shamsu emerged as the lone bright spot in the innings. Batting with intent, he counter-attacked with three sixes in a brisk 29 off 15 deliveries, briefly threatening to lift the Lions to a competitive total. His dismissal, caught by Mahesh Nangude off Ankit Yadav, exposed the fragile middle order.The decisive moment arrived in the seventh over, the designated 50-50 over, when Vivek Shelar turned the game on its head.Shelar claimed a sensational hat-trick, bowling Pradeep Patil before dismissing Amit Naik and Birendra Ram on successive deliveries, reducing the Lions to disarray. The lower order failed to mount any resistance thereafter, with a late run-out of Majid Yousuf Sheikh further compounding their woes. Ahmedabad eventually limped to 72/9, with Shelar finishing with outstanding figures of 3/3, well supported by Firdos Alam (2/15) and Ankit Yadav (2/14).Chasing 73 for a place in the final, the Tiigers suffered early setbacks. Rahul Mundhe was dismissed for a two-ball duck by Jignesh Patel, before Farman Khan struck twice in the second over to remove Kiran Pawar for 8 and Mahesh Nangude for 1, reducing Kolkata to 1/3.Saroj Pramanik anchored the chase with a measured 25 off 22 balls. Although Pramanik was dismissed in the ninth over by Ashiq Ali Shamsu, captain Bhawesh Pawar sealed the contest in emphatic fashion, smashing an unbeaten 10 off just two balls to guide the Tiigers into the final, where they will face Chennai Singams on Friday.The ISPL Season 3 Final will begin at 7 PM, with live coverage on Star Sports Khel and streaming on JioHotstar.

NEW DELHI: Few clubs in Indian football have risen as swiftly or as symbolically as Real Kashmir FC. From their debut season to becoming consistent contenders in the Indian Football League (IFL), the Srinagar-based club has carved out a reputation for resilience and ambition. Yet, as the upcoming I-League season prepares to kick off on Feb 21, the Snow Leopards find themselves navigating a familiar terrain of uncertainty both on and off the pitch.Real Kashmir, back-to-back IFA Shield winners (2020 and 2021), have finished among the top five six times in I-League in the seven seasons they have competed. However, the postponement of the season has created significant logistical and financial challenges, not just for Real Kashmir but for clubs across the league.Club owner Arshad Shawl, who took over as part of the leadership group in 2019, candidly said that the turmoil is the result of a system that leaned too heavily on a single private entity for over a decade.“You have to understand the ecosystem of Indian football over the last 15 years,” Shawl told TOI. “When that private support was pulled out, there was no contingency plan in place.”With the All India Football Federation (AIFF) under financial strain, I-League clubs have been forced to absorb much of the operational burden themselves.For Real Kashmir, the challenge is compounded by geography and climate. Pre-season preparations in sub-zero temperatures, coupled with an an uncertain calendar, have made the task even tougher.“Starting this season is like starting a frozen engine in minus temperatures and asking it to run a rally,” Shawl added.Despite the obstacles, the club’s philosophy stays firmly rooted in local identity. Real Kashmir have consistently prioritised Kashmiri players and home grown talent, a vision reflected in the appointment of former India international and Kashmir native Ishfaq Ahmed as head coach. Under his guidance, the club has become a platform for local footballers to dream bigger. “This club has put Kashmir on the front pages for a happier reason,” Shawl said. “It allowed the world to look at Kashmir through the lens of football.”Beyond the first team, Real Kashmir has invested in a structured youth development, blending local prospects with experienced Indian and overseas players. A capable backroom staff supports the squad.”What continues to hold the club back, Shawl insists, is beyond its control. “We are doing everything that we can control,” he said, pointing to ownership stability, player commitment, and grass roots development.","Real Kashmir have been consistent contenders in the Indian Football League (IFL) The Snow Leopards have finished among the top five six times in the seven seasons they have competed.

NEW DELHI: Bengaluru FC players, including India legend Sunil Chhetri , have agreed to take a pay cut for the truncated Indian Super League (ISL) season starting February 14, with club owner Parth Jindal thanking the squad for making the “sacrifice” in the best interests of both the franchise and the sport.Jindal said the management held open and honest discussions with the first-team players about “navigating the situation the sport finds itself in,” as the delayed ISL prepares to restart after being paused for more than four months.Highlighting the challenges facing Indian football, Jindal took to X to explain the club’s position.""Everyone is well aware of the challenging phase Indian Football is going through. For me, as BFC team owner and someone who is deeply passionate about the sport and the club, this has been one of the toughest periods ever,"" Jindal wrote on 'X'.""I am grateful to all the first team players who have agreed to reduce their remuneration during this phase.""Without a doubt, this was one of the toughest decisions we have had to make as a club, and I truly appreciate that the players have made this sacrifice in the best interests of the club and the sport.""Jindal had earlier urged players across clubs to “make sacrifices” citing the “financial burden” franchises would face to participate in the delayed league, even warning that without player support his club might have to “shut shop for good.” While he had not detailed the nature of the sacrifice at the time, he hinted at salary reductions for the season.Bengaluru FC’s squad includes former India captain Sunil Chhetri and star goalkeeper Gurpreet Singh Sandhu. The club has also appointed former India international Renedy Singh as first-team head coach for the upcoming campaign.Last month, FC Goa players, including India captain Sandesh Jhingan, along with support staff, also accepted pay cuts for the shortened season, with the club calling it a “selfless” move and saying it was “deeply humbled by this gesture and immensely grateful for the unity, character, and commitment shown by the group.” FC Goa’s roster also features India players Udanta Singh and Boris Singh.The ISL 2025–26 season was thrown into uncertainty after former organiser FSDL ended its Master Rights Agreement with the AIFF on December 8. Although a tender for a new commercial partner drew no bidders, intervention from the sports minister and negotiations ensured all 14 clubs confirmed participation. A truncated season featuring 91 matches will be played on a home-and-away basis, with each team contesting 13 games.The AIFF has since issued the Request for Proposal for broadcast rights, with bids set to open on February 2. Clubs will bear 60 per cent of the league’s financial cost, estimated at Rs 25 crore. Fixtures are expected to be announced soon.","Bengaluru FC players have agreed to take a pay cut for the truncated Indian Super League (ISL) season starting February 14.

The NFL celebrated its biggest stars in San Francisco, and the results reshaped several legacies in one electric night. Veterans cemented greatness. Rising talents announced their arrival. Records fell. Comebacks inspired. By the time the curtain dropped ahead of Super Bowl LX, the league had honored both dominance and resilience in equal measure.From a 37-year-old quarterback rewriting history to a defensive force smashing sack records, this year’s NFL Honors delivered clarity about who truly defined the 2025 season. Here is a sharp look at the night’s biggest winners and why their impact goes beyond a trophy.Stafford delivered a masterpiece season with 4,707 passing yards and 46 touchdowns. He also posted a remarkable 5.8 touchdown to interception ratio. At 37, he led the league in every major passing category and threw 28 straight touchdowns without a pick during one stunning stretch. Few seasons at his age compare.Garrett broke the single-season sack record with 23. Even with constant double teams, he stayed relentless.Browns defensive line coach Jacques Cesaire summed it up best: ""When you got that much attention for you every week and you're still putting up the numbers that he's putting up, that's pretty special.""McMillan topped all rookies with 1,014 receiving yards and gave Bryce Young a true No. 1 option. Young said it clearly: ""He was elite,'' and added, ""He's a special player.''After injury setbacks, McCaffrey returned with 2,126 scrimmage yards. Coach Kyle Shanahan praised him: ""I think this was one of the most impressive seasons by an individual player ever.""Vrabel engineered a 10-win turnaround and a Super Bowl run. Stefon Diggs captured the locker room mood: ""Probably the best coach I've ever had,"" and added, ""I don't know how he does it. He got me to buy in, I'll tell you that.""Add in Jaxon Smith-Njigba’s Offensive Player of the Year campaign, Joe Thuney’s Protector honor, and Carson Schwesinger’s rookie defensive surge, and the message is clear.

Jaxson Dart and Marissa Ayers make a statement at NFL Honours

New York Giants QB Jaxson Dart found himself in a different kind of limelight at the 2026 NFL Honors in San Francisco, stepping onto the red carpet with Marissa Ayers. The moment quickly caught attention, marking a notable offseason move for the young QB as cameras followed the pair all night.While Dart’s rookie season already put him on the national radar, this stunning appearance added another twist to his profile. Calm, confident, and clearly comfortable, the New York Giants signal-caller shared the moment with Marissa Ayers, keeping details minimal but presence unmistakable.Jaxson Dart and Marissa Ayers didn’t need any medium to steal the show. Their red carpet entry was polished and understated, drawing eyes without trying too hard. Ayers’ stunning metallic golden gown matched perfectly with Dart’s clean, classic dark suit, creating one of the evening's more talked-about entrances.The appearance also hinted at a relationship that has gradually become more visible over recent months. The lovebirds have already gained more attention with their viral Instagram post, in which Ayers took a mirror selfie with the QB and captioned it, “rumour has it.”And Dart reacted to it, which confirmed their relationship.Big Blue’s star player revealed her importance in an interview with People, “I think that just in the world that we live in, we try to keep as much as we can, you know, between us,” and added that he is “grateful for her and the time and how much we’ve been able to build this connection.”From subtle social media moments to public outings, the two have moved at their own pace, letting moments speak rather than statements. NFL Honours became the biggest stage yet.Star-QB Jaxson Dart’s rookie season gave Big Blue fans reasons for optimism. He finished the season with 2,275 passing yards, 15 TDs, and just 5 interceptions, while adding crucial value as a runner.

Lawsuit focuses on alleged punch and public accusations

A Detroit Lions fan has filed a massive lawsuit after an alleged confrontation with an NFL player turned into a massive talking point. On Feb. 5, Ryan Kennedy moved court with a $100 million lawsuit against Pittsburgh Steelers WR DK Metcalf, claiming assault and defamation following a game-day incident.Kennedy, represented by the Marko Law Firm, filed the lawsuit. The suit also names former WR Chad Ochocinco Johnson and Shannon Sharpe’s media company, Shay Shay Media. Kennedy claims Metcalf punched him during the incident and that false allegations about his conduct were later shared publicly.According to the filing, Johnson stated on a podcast that Kennedy used a highly offensive racial slur toward Metcalf and made another inappropriate comment involving Metcalf’s mother. Metcalf has never publicly confirmed that such language was used. That distinction plays a central role in Kennedy’s defamation claim.Kennedy acknowledged the issue during a press conference in downtown Detroit on Feb. 5, 2026. ""I didn't use any racial slurs, no hate speech,"" He further added, ""I mean, none of that stuff at the game. Actually never. Fifteen years as a season ticket holder for the Lions, I've never done that at all.”During the same segment, Kennedy again referred to Metcalf by his full first name, DeKaylin. Kennedy has previously said that using Metcalf’s legal name angered the player and escalated the situation.Attorney Jon Marko released a statement on Feb. 5, saying that false public accusations can permanently damage a person’s reputation. He said the claims made about Kennedy affected his family life, business interests, and personal safety.Attorney Gasper Stare also chimes in and shared his view in a statement that reads, “What kind of reasonable person, let alone a white man in 2025 here in downtown Detroit, would go out and shout out the n-word across a field? That doesn’t make much sense now, does it? But DK Metcalf exploding that does make sense.”Kennedy told reporters the lawsuit was filed only after repeated requests for a retraction were ignored. When asked what exactly he said before the confrontation, his attorneys declined to answer, saying the question shifts attention away from the alleged punch and the media fallout that followed.","Detroit Lions fan Ryan Kennedy filed a $100 million lawsuit against Pittsburgh Steelers WR DK Metcalf on Feb. 5.

Matthew Stafford arrives for NFL Honors glory, but Kelly Stafford ’s coordinated family look steals every camera



Matthew Stafford is NFL MVP. And the Los Angeles Rams QB arrived at the 2026 NFL Honors with much anticipation, but the night quickly became about more than a trophy. The ceremony took place days after a painful NFC Championship Game loss to the Seattle Seahawks, a defeat that ended Super Bowl hopes yet framed the context of Stafford’s season. Football’s biggest individual award now sits alongside a much louder story about legacy, resilience, and family.At 37, Stafford entered the awards night carrying both elite numbers and heavy emotion. He led the league with 4,707 passing yards and 46 touchdowns while throwing just eight interceptions, a statistical peak that placed him in rare company. The timing mattered. This was his first top-five finish in MVP voting, and it came during a year when every piece finally aligned.Why this season stands apart is rooted in both production and circumstance. Stafford was not chasing personal glory. He was chasing relevance after seasons marked by injuries and questions about how much he had left. The answer came in weekly proof. He delivered under pressure, guided the Rams deep into January, and authored one of the league’s most efficient passing campaigns.When the Rams’ season ended in Seattle, the numbers still told a brutal truth.Stafford became the first quarterback in NFL history to throw for 350 yards with three touchdowns and no turnovers and still lose a playoff game. Hours later, the scene shifted from locker rooms to living rooms. At 2:30 a.m., he was home, holding one of his daughters after she told him she felt bad for him.That family presence followed him everywhere this season. From custom Rams coats in playoff games to matching winter outfits on the road, Stafford’s wife Kelly and their four daughters became familiar figures. At his final home game against the Arizona Cardinals, they waited for him near the tunnel. As the video board lit up, one of them pointed and yelled, “We’re on there! Look at it!” Kelly leaned in and said, “Last game of Daddy’s 17th season. ” Stafford smiled, told them, “I love you guys,” and returned to the field to throw four more touchdowns.That same support arrived at NFL Honors. The entire family flew in, walked the red carpet together, and quietly stole attention. Whether Stafford wins the MVP or not, his place among finalists alongside Drake Maye, Josh Allen, Trevor Lawrence, and Christian McCaffrey confirms the season’s weight.Later, reflecting on it all, Stafford offered perspective that framed the year better than any stat line.“I get to play this game. I’ve gotten to play it for 17 years,” Stafford said on his “Let’s Go!” podcast. “I’ve got four little girls that are cheering me on, a beautiful wife that’s doing the same. And sports, and football in particular, is difficult at times, but it also gives me the opportunity to teach my kids and be something for them, right? I could sit there and go, ‘Man, I feel like I played good and we didn’t win, and this happened and that happened, and excuses. ’“But it’s like, ‘No, have the courage to go put yourself out there, live with the results and learn from ’em.’”While giving his acceptance speech, Stafford gave a positive update regarding his future as the MVP said,""I will see you guys next year."" He will return with Super Bowl dream.","Matthew Stafford was named NFL MVP. He led the league with 4,707 passing yards and 46 touchdowns while throwing just eight interceptions.

Laila Edwards’ historic Milan moment gets an unlikely boost from Travis and Jason Kelce



Laila Edwards became the story on ice as the 2026 Winter Olympics opened in Italy, and her name carried more than a box score. Laila Edwards took the spotlight not just for Team USA’s 5-1 win over the Czech Republic, but for what her presence meant. She skated as the first Black woman to represent the United States in women’s Olympic hockey, a moment rooted in years of family sacrifice and community belief.This was history made by a 22-year-old forward who grew up chasing pucks in Cleveland Heights. The meaning ran deeper when it became known that two familiar names from that same city, Travis and Jason Kelce, helped make sure her family could witness it live.Laila Edwards’ Olympic debut on February 5 came with 14 family members in the stands, including her 91-year-old grandmother Ernestine Gray. That scene existed because of a GoFundMe launched by her parents to help them travel to Italy. “This just isn't something that we can afford to do on our own. So many communities have supported Laila throughout her years of hockey. We are asking for your help now so that we can be there to cheer Laila, to surround her with the love and support of family,” it read.Behind the scenes, Travis and Jason Kelce donated $10,000. When Travis later called Edwards, his message stayed with her.“Everyone's got my back.” She told the Associated Press, “He’s rooting for me. They didn’t have to do that, but they did. And I’m really grateful.”“Obviously, my name’s on the roster, but I feel like my whole family made it to the Olympics,” she said. “All the sacrifices they’ve made, the things they’ve done to get me here, my parents, my siblings, I’m so grateful. And for them to get to come and share the experience is going to be really special.” Her mother Charone Gray-Edwards added, “Oh my goodness. I was going to find words to describe the gratitude and appreciation. But I haven’t yet.”The bond with the Kelces started earlier. On the New Heights podcast in 2023, Travis said, “One of Cleveland Heights’ own, and University of Wisconsin forward, Laila Edwards. Shoutout to Leila Edwards. She’s set to become the first Black woman to play for Team USA senior hockey team. You got my love and support. Go out there and hold it down for Team USA baby!” Charone later reflected, “Two years ago, when Kelce first gave a shout-out to Laila, I thought it was huge and cool for him to acknowledge her. And then when she said 'thank you' to him, he responded. He's been kind. So this is exciting that his kindness even went further.”The GoFundMe has now crossed $60,000. Edwards has already decided what comes next. “We really want to honor the money that’s been given to us.” Extra funds will return to Cleveland Heights through equipment and free ice time, closing the circle that started her journey.","Laila Edwards is the first Black woman to represent the U.S. in women's Olympic hockey.

She remains the only woman to win Olympic gold twice in the snowboard halfpipe, first as a 17-year-old in Pyeongchang and again in Beijing in 2022.That dominance established her as a generational talent, but it is her honesty off the snow that continues to deepen her impact.Ahead of the Games, Kim shared an emotional message reflecting on what this third Olympic appearance represents. She wrote, “I can’t believe I’ve arrived in Milan to represent my country at the Olympic Games for the third time. If you told little me that, she wouldn’t believe you. This one feels especially meaningful for so many reasons. My parents left South Korea in search of a better future for their family, leaving behind everything they knew so that my sisters and I could one day have the chance to live the American dream, a sacrifice I will never take for granted. So when I stand at the top of the halfpipe, competing on the biggest stage in sport, I do so with immense pride, representing not only my country but also those who took a leap of faith and came to this beautiful nation carrying hopes, dreams, and courage. I am proud of my heritage, I am proud of my journey, and I am proud to represent a country that is strongest when it embraces diversity, dignity, and hope. GO TEAM USA!! ❤️🤍💙”The post appeared at a time when Kim had already opened up about the injury that once threatened her Olympic hopes. That vulnerability, paired with her recovery, reframed her return as more than a medal chase. It became a statement of perseverance.Away from competition, Kim also drew headlines by publicly confirming her relationship with NFL star Myles Garrett, adding another layer of cultural visibility to an athlete who has long transcended her sport. She also turned heads with a striking winter look featured by Elle, proving once again that she shapes conversations on her own terms.Soon, the focus will narrow to the halfpipe. Kim will return to her Team USA uniform with a chance to secure a third straight gold, a feat that would further redefine what greatness looks like in snowboarding.",Chloe Kim is the only woman to win Olympic gold twice in the snowboard halfpipe.

"From Sydney Sweeney rumors to Hannah Stocking sightings, Puka Nacua’s off-field life grabs Hollywood attention",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/from-sydney-sweeney-rumors-to-hannah-stocking-sightings-puka-nacuas-off-field-life-grabs-hollywood-attention/articleshow/127962180.cms,"Puka Nacua Spotted with Influencer Hannah Stocking (Getty Images)

Puka Nacua’s Hollywood crossover continues as influencer Hannah Stocking enters the picture after Sydney Sweeney buzz



Puka Nacua's dating life has become a talking point off the field after the Los Angeles Rams wide receiver was seen dining with social media star Hannah Stocking in West Hollywood. The sighting, reported from January 31 at the upscale Matsuhisa restaurant, sparked immediate buzz as fans tried to connect recent social media moments with real world appearances. The meeting raised one clear question. Was this a casual dinner or the first sign of something more?The timing made the outing impossible to ignore. Just days earlier, Nacua had gone viral for a bold yet playful interaction with actress Sydney Sweeney on X. The young receiver, fresh off another season that cemented his status as one of the NFL ’s rising stars, suddenly found his personal life pulling nearly as much attention as his production on Sundays.The interest around Puka Nacua dating life did not start with Hannah Stocking. It began when Nacua responded to a quote from Sydney Sweeney that quickly captured the internet’s attention. During her interview with Complex Magazine, Sweeney said, “Athletic and outgoing and funny. I’m a sporty girl, so someone needs to be able to climb a mountain with me, go skydiving with me. And someone who loves their family,"" when asked what she's looking for in a man.Nacua reposted the quote and added a simple reply, ""Love skydiving"". The comment exploded, crossing 19 million views and placing him firmly in pop culture conversations.While that moment did not lead to any public response from Sweeney, it kept Nacua visible beyond football circles. Days later, photos surfaced showing him arm in arm with Stocking after dinner. Stocking, 33, is one of the most recognizable faces in digital entertainment, with more than 60 million followers across platforms. Her long standing influence and past high profile relationship with NBA star Klay Thompson added another layer to the story.For Nacua, 24, the attention comes during an offseason shaped by both achievement and scrutiny. He recently wrapped up his third NFL season after a historic rookie campaign that rewrote record books. At the same time, he faced criticism late last year for a gesture made during a livestream. His public apology on Instagram, where he said he was unaware the gesture was offensive and rejected any form of hate, was widely noted as a moment of accountability.Before the Stocking rumors, Nacua was linked to Hallie Aiono from 2021 into early 2025. Her emotional post celebrating his first professional touchdown remains a reminder of how closely his personal milestones have been followed. Now, with another public sighting fueling speculation, Nacua enters the offseason under a brighter spotlight than ever.",Puka Nacua was seen dining with social media star Hannah Stocking in West Hollywood.

Turning Point USA is stepping directly into Super Bowl weekend with a rival halftime event that aims to challenge the NFL ’s main stage.

Emma Stone’s Super Bowl memories explain why this year feels different

Emma Stone is opening up about her Super Bowl memories and it took an unexpected and funny turn when the actor talked about her personal history with the NFL’s biggest night. In a new Rolling Stone interview published Wednesday, Feb. 4, the 37-year-old reflected on attending one of the league’s most forgettable title games and still finding joy in the moment. Her comments land just days before kickoff, placing her squarely in the middle of the Super Bowl conversation.What makes Stone’s take stand out is not fandom hype but honesty. She is not selling nostalgia or celebrity glamour. She is recalling a shared experience that blended work, football, and laughter. That grounded tone now shapes her anticipation for Sunday’s game, which she says she plans to watch closely, especially with a halftime performance that genuinely excites her.Emma Stone recalled attending Super Bowl LIII while filming Zombieland 2 in Atlanta, describing the game with blunt humor. “We went to what was one of the most famously slow and kind of uneventful Super Bowls in history, apparently,” she said.“It was in Atlanta a couple years ago, we were shooting Zombieland 2, and so the whole cast and crew kind of went and watched it, and not much happened, but it was still fun.”Her memory lapse about the halftime show became a moment fans quickly embraced. Asked who performed, she paused before admitting, “That’s a really good question. Let me Google that, give me one second. Clearly this was not… oh — Maroon 5.” The band headlined the 2019 halftime show alongside Travis Scott and Big Boi, a fact Stone clearly did not carry with her afterward.This year, however, Stone’s interest feels more personal. She confirmed she will be watching Super Bowl LX and made it clear why. “I’m definitely going to watch the Super Bowl — I am very invested in it,” she said. “My brother was a high school quarterback, so I will be watching with him, and that’ll be fun. But I’m really excited for Bad Bunny, obviously.”Stone has not seen Bad Bunny live but hopes that changes soon. “No, but I would love to. So I feel like I’m gonna see him in concert in a couple of days. We all are!” The game will kick off at 6:30 p.m. ET on Sunday, Feb. 8, at Levi’s Stadium in Santa Clara, Calif., with the Seattle Seahawks facing the New England Patriots. Along with Bad Bunny, performances are expected from Green Day, Charlie Puth, Brandi Carlile, and Coco Jones.",Emma Stone is opening up about her Super Bowl memories in a new interview.

Be a playoff team.” Steve believes that the team’s goal has not changed.

Everything you need to know about Ousmane Dieng's trade



Milwaukee Bucks received: Ousmane Dieng and Nigel Hayes Davis

Chicago Bulls received: Nick Richards

Phoenix Suns received: Cole Anthony and Amir Coffey

Ousmane Dieng became one of the most unusual names on the NBA transaction wire after his career took a sharp and unexpected turn within a single day. The 22-year-old forward changed teams three times as part of a fast-moving sequence of deadline adjustments.By the time the dust settled, Dieng found a landing spot with the Milwaukee Bucks. The final destination ended a whirlwind stretch that began with one trade. It has continued through two reroutes as trade deadline tension propelled the front offices to make rapid decisions as they upgrade their roster.Ousmane Dieng’s day began when Oklahoma City sent him to Charlotte in a move tied to Mason Plumlee. Hours later, Charlotte included him in a package connected to a separate deal involving Coby White. From there, Chicago moved Dieng again as part of a reworked three-team trade that redirected Nick Richards to the Bulls and sent Dieng to Milwaukee.

For Dieng, the rapid movement ended with the Bucks, where he is expected to remain after one of the most surprising trade paths of the season.The final deal reshaped multiple rosters. Below is a clear breakdown of how the trade unfolded and what each team gained.For Milwaukee, the move adds a young wing with size at 6-feet-9 and long-term flexibility. Dieng is in the final year of his rookie contract and will enter restricted free agency this summer, giving the Bucks control over his future.Dieng was drafted 11th overall in 2022 and spent four seasons with Oklahoma City. Across his time with the Thunder, he averaged 4.2 points and 2.1 rebounds in limited minutes. This season, he showed growth as a shooter, posting a career-best 36.7 percent from three-point range.","Ousmane Dieng got traded 3 times in 24 hours. The 22-year-old forward changed teams three times as part of a fast-moving sequence of deadline adjustments.

Steve Kerr drops an honest reaction after the Jonathan Kuminga trade



The Warriors traded Jonathan Kuminga to the Atlanta Hawks for Kristaps Porziņģis



The long-running tension between Jonathan Kuminga and the Golden State Warriors reached its conclusion when the franchise finalized a trade sending the 23-year-old forward to the Atlanta Hawks. The move ended months of uncertainty around Kuminga’s role and future. The trade has also updated Golden State’s roster as it continues to chase results in the Western Conference.Head coach Steve Kerr reveals that the deal was necessary. Speaking openly after the trade, Kerr framed Kuminga’s exit as the result of a fitting issue.Steve Kerr explained that Jonathan Kuminga entered the league in a difficult environment. Golden State is still locked into a win-now mindset when the former No. 7 overall pick arrived from the G League.“I think it was a tough situation for everybody, given how raw he was when he got here and given we were still playing for championships,” Kerr said, per Anthony Slater.“He needed the runway to make more mistakes. He needed the experience of being in the NBA and understanding what it was about. For him, it was very tough not being allowed to make those mistakes.For us as a staff, it was tricky trying to develop him while we were trying to win. I think it’s as simple as that.”Kerr added that Kuminga’s presence in the locker room never caused friction. “Everybody liked him. I liked him. He’s a really good guy. Very personable. Well-liked in the locker room. Just a tough fit.”Kuminga contributed during the Warriors’ 2022 title run and flashed potential across multiple seasons.Golden State’s decision to move Kuminga came with a clear roster objective. The Warriors acquired Kristaps Porziņģis to help Stephen Curry and Draymond Green.Kuminga’s 2025-26 campaign showed instability. He opened the year strong as a starter, then saw his role reduced after injuries and lineup shifts. Despite brief scoring bursts when opportunities reopened, his standing was never stabilized.Atlanta now offers Kuminga a reset and a clearer developmental path. This season, Kuminga is averaging 12.1 points per game, 5.8 rebounds, and 2.5 assists.","Golden State Warriors traded Jonathan Kuminga to the Atlanta Hawks for Kristaps Porziņģis.

Joel Embiid’s numbers this season

What to watch before the Philadelphia 76ers vs Los Angeles Lakers game (February 5, 2026)

’ game against the Los Angeles Lakers on Thursday,. The team has not confirmed his availability, and a decision is expected shortly before tip-off.The listing is related to right knee injury management. Philadelphia has followed a controlled workload plan with Embiid this season to avoid aggravating the knee and to keep him healthy over the long schedule.Embiid missed the Sixers’ win over the Golden State Warriors on February 3. That absence was part of the same management plan and came during a back-to-back set. There is some belief he could return against the Lakers, but the team has not guaranteed anything.The latest NBA injury report lists Joel Embiid as “Questionable - Right Knee; Injury Management.” This means he still has a chance to play, but he must go through warm-ups and pregame testing before the medical staff clears him.Teams usually confirm statuses about 90 minutes before tip-off, making late updates the most important.If Embiid does not play, Adem Bona is the likely replacement at center. That shift would move Barlow into a larger frontcourt role and place more scoring responsibility on Maxey and Edgecombe.Embiid has appeared in 29 games entering early February. He is averaging about 26 points, 11 rebounds, 3.8 assists, and 1.1 blocks per game.When he is unavailable, Philadelphia 76ers relies more on Maxey for scoring. Edgecombe has taken on a larger two-way role, while Barlow and Bona handle more of the interior work.The knee plan is intended to support Embiid’s availability later in the season as the Sixers compete for playoff positioning in the Eastern Conference.• Participation in warm-ups often signals whether he will play.• Official injury updates typically arrive around 90 minutes before the 10:00 p.m. ET start.• If he sits, Philadelphia is likely to use more pick-and-roll sets and depend on perimeter scoring rather than post offense.Joel Embiid has not been ruled out for the matchup against the Lakers, but he has not been cleared either. His status depends on how the knee responds before the game.Also read: Is LeBron James playing tonight vs the Philadelphia 76ers? Latest update on the Los Angeles Lakers star's injury report (February 5, 2026) For now, he should be considered a game-time decision.","Joel Embiid is listed as “Questionable - Right Knee; Injury Management’ The team has not confirmed his availability, and a decision is expected shortly before tip-off.

LeBron James' Current health situation

What happened in the last meeting

Why the game matters

’ home game against the Philadelphia 76ers on Thursday,, at Crypto.com Arena. He is not listed on the team’s injury report and is expected to play without restriction.His availability gives the Lakers their main playmaker for a game that could affect the standings in both conferences. Los Angeles is working to stay inside the top six in the Western Conference, while Philadelphia is competing for position in the East.The Los Angeles Lakers have ruled out rookie forward Adou Thiero due to a right MCL sprain. No other players appear on the injury list, leaving the team close to full strength.James has now played in 15 straight games after missing 16 of the first 22 this season. In 32 appearances, he is averaging 22.1 points, 5.8 rebounds, 6.2 assists, and 1.3 steals. He continues to handle major offensive responsibilities and often initiates possessions.Regular minutes from James have helped the Lakers maintain lineup stability after an inconsistent start to the season.LeBron James dealt with sciatica and arthritis in his left foot earlier in the year.Those issues have been monitored, but they have not forced him out of recent games. His absence from the latest injury report indicates the team is comfortable with his condition.The Lakers have leaned on a core group of James, Luka Dončić, and Austin Reaves. Reaves recently returned after missing 19 games with a calf strain, giving the rotation more structure entering this matchup.Philadelphia 76ers enters the game with a 29-21 record, sixth in the Eastern Conference. The Lakers are 30-19 and sit fifth in the West.The 76ers rely heavily on Tyrese Maxey and Joel Embiid for scoring, which means LeBron James will likely split his role between attacking the defense and creating shots for teammates.In the previous meeting on December 7, 2025, James finished with 29 points, seven rebounds, and six assists. He made a go-ahead three-pointer late in the game as the Lakers secured a 112-108 win.This result could influence playoff seeding for both teams. A win would strengthen the Lakers’ position and help them build momentum ahead of a busy part of the schedule.Also read: Is Luka Doncic playing tonight vs the Philadelphia 76ers?

Poll Will Australia's decision to rest Pat Cummins impact their performance in the Boxing Day Test? Yes, it will hurt their chances No, they can manage without him Unsure, it depends on the team performance It may motivate other players to step up

Australia squad for fourth Test:

Steve Smith (c), Scott Boland, Alex Carey, Brendan Doggett, Cameron Green, Travis Head, Josh Inglis, Usman Khawaja, Marnus Labuschagne, Todd Murphy, Michael Neser, Jhye Richardson, Mitchell Starc, Jake Weatherald, Beau Webster.

Australia will head into the Boxing Day Test at the Melbourne Cricket Ground without captain Pat Cummins and veteran spinner Nathan Lyon , opting to manage workloads and injuries after securing an unassailable Ashes lead over England.Cricket Australia confirmed on Tuesday that Cummins has been rested as part of an ongoing management plan, while Lyon will undergo surgery on a torn right hamstring, sidelining him for an extended period. Todd Murphy and Jhye Richardson have been added to a 15-man squad for the fourth Test, which begins on Friday.Australia have already retained the Ashes with dominant victories — eight-wicket wins in Perth and Brisbane, followed by an 82-run triumph in Adelaide to take a 3-0 series lead. With the series safely in hand, selectors have chosen caution over continuity for the high-profile Boxing Day clash.Cummins, who returned in Adelaide after missing Tests since July due to lower back issues, claimed six wickets in the match. However, the fast bowler will now sit out in Melbourne and could also be under a cloud for the Sydney Test, given Australia’s focus on managing his long-term fitness.Steve Smith will resume captaincy after missing the Adelaide Test with vertigo symptoms.Smith had previously led the side in Cummins’ absence earlier in the series.Lyon’s absence is a significant blow. The 38-year-old injured his right hamstring while diving to save a boundary on day five in Adelaide and hobbled off the field. Despite the injury, he claimed his 564th Test wicket in the match, moving past Glenn McGrath into sixth place on the all-time Test bowling list.Murphy is in line for a dream home Test debut, having played all seven of his previous Tests overseas. The Victorian spinner edged out Matt Kuhnemann and Corey Rocchiccioli for the spot and last featured for Australia in Sri Lanka earlier this year. Richardson, meanwhile, is eyeing a return to Test cricket after a four-year absence following three shoulder surgeries.Scott Boland and Mitchell Starc are set to spearhead the pace attack again after pulling up well from Adelaide, with Michael Neser and Brendan Doggett also in contention.","Cummins has been rested as part of an ongoing management plan.

BCCI to review India's performance in Under-19 Asia Cup

MUMBAI: In a year in which they finally ended their wait for a maiden World Cup crown by winning the 2025 Women’s ODI World Cup at home in November, there is more good news for India’s women cricketers.In another landmark decision for women's cricket in India, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) has decided to introduce a massive pay hike for India’s women domestic cricketers, more than doubling the per-day domestic match fees of senior women cricketers from Rs 20,000 to Rs 50,000.At present, for senior women's tournaments, players in the playing XI are paid Rs 20,000 per day, and reserves are paid Rs 10,000 per day.For junior women's tournaments, players in the playing 11 are paid Rs 10,000 per day, and reserves are paid Rs 5,000 per day in all T20 tournaments.Presently, on average, a senior women's cricketer receives around Rs 2 lakhs for a season if the team only plays the league stages of senior tournaments.As per the revised pay structure, which will soon be implemented by the BCCI for the senior women's tournaments, players will earn Rs 50,000 per day for being in the playing XI and Rs 25,000 per day for reserves.For T20 matches, their match fees will be Rs 25,000 for being in the playing XI and Rs 12,500 for being in the reserves.For junior women's tournaments, players will get Rs 25,000 per day for being in the playing XI, and Rs 12,500 per day will be given to the reserves.For T20 matches, the fees will be Rs 12,500 for the playing XI and Rs 6,250 for the reserves.""We have more than doubled the match fees of India's domestic women cricketers. We are only carrying forward the initiative of (former BCCI secretary and current ICC chairman) Jay Shah, who introduced pay parity for India's international cricketers,"" BCCI vice-president Rajeev Shukla told TOI.Meanwhile, concerned by India's poor performance in the Under-19 Asia Cup final after the team suffered a crushing 191-run defeat to Pakistan in the summit clash in Dubai, the BCCI will review the Indian team's performance in the tournament.""We are concerned by this heavy defeat. We will basically have a brainstorming session to strengthen our Under-19 cricket,"" Shukla said.The review is important since the 2026 Under-19 World Cup will be held in Zimbabwe and Namibia, starting from January 15.It means that the Board will seek a report from the team manager Salil Datar and hold discussions with head coach Hrishikesh Kanitkar, bowling coach Sunil Joashi and perhaps captain Ayush Mhatre.The BCCI is also concerned with the poor player conduct during the ill-tempered final against Pakistan.","BCCI to review India's performance in Under-19 Asia Cup final.

Why Rohit Sharma got really emotional at a promotional event

TOI.

""What you saw at the Asia Cup was just the trailer,” says Biju Nair, the former Services coach, who shaped Aaron George since his early teens. “Picture abhi baaki hain,"" he insists.It captures the essence of Aaron. What the U-19 Asia Cup in Dubai last week revealed was control, maturity and restraint. What it concealed — by design — was his range, power and flair.The full film, Nair insists, is yet to unfold.The teenager though, has never been one for excessive words. He prefers to let his bat do the talking.“I know what works best for me,” Aaron says. External factors like crowd, noise, occasion, and opposition stay outside his bubble.In the just-concluded U-19 Asia Cup in Dubai, Aaron, the captain, lived up to his hype, scoring two impactful knocks — an 88-ball 85 against Pakistan in the league game. It became the spine of the chase: not flashy, but chose his response and owned the ball-versus-bat battle. This was followed by a composed 58 against Sri Lanka.Everything, however, unravelled in the final against Pakistan.""Everyone had an off day,"" he rued.Aaron also chose to play down the altercations between the Indian and Pakistani players during the summit clash.Against Pakistan, there was confidence without bravado. It was leadership through composure, even if it showed only a slice of his true attacking range.Aaron grew up in Hyderabad, but his roots run deep in Kerala. His father Easo Varghese hails from Mavelikara, mother Preeti, from Kottayam.A former sub-inspector with the Hyderabad Police, Easo spotted something special when Aaron was just four. At his in-laws’ place, the boy picked up a plastic bat and instinctively played with a straight bat. No slogging. No wild swings. Just balance, poise.“That’s when I knew,” Easo recalls. “There was something natural there,” he tellsTraining began at home. Easo used 50-gram plastic balls and turned the living room into a miniature cricket pitch.""The emphasis was unwavering: straight bat, still head, eyes level. Those early routines laid the foundation for a batter built on efficiency rather than excesses,"" Easo recollects.A significant turn came when Aaron met B Subhash, an NIS coach and family friend.From 2014 to 2017, Aaron attended the HCA camp free of cost, and was the youngest participant there, holding his own against older boys until the camp shut down. Later, Nair stepped in, adding structure, discipline and tactical depth to his game.“He’s much more than what people have seen,” Nair insists. “He’s a far better striker of the ball than what he showcased at the Asia Cup.”In 2022, the selectors made a bold decision. With an opener’s slot available, they chose not to protect Aaron in age-group cricket but tested him in senior league division matches. He played five games that year and four more in 2023. The learning curve was steep, but it forged resilience.“They wanted to see if he could survive,” Easo says. “He didn’t just survive, he adapted.”That year at the U-16 Vijay Merchant Trophy, Aaron smashed 303 against Bihar, a knock that underlined his burgeoning talent. Later that year, at the BCCI High Performance camp in Vijayawada, he followed it up with a composed 83 against Delhi in the Vinoo Mankad Trophy.This year, Aaron wasn’t just part of the Hyderabad U-19 setup, he was leading it. As an opener, he scored 373 runs in five matches at a striking rate of 145, steering Hyderabad to the Vinoo Mankad title.What stands out is his evolution. Once a classical opener, Aaron has seamlessly adjusted to the No. 3 role while donning the India jersey — repairing and rebuilding when early wickets fell — accelerating when the moment demands.His idols reflect that balance and hunger to expand his game.""He admires Virat Kohli’s intensity and AB de Villiers’ philosophy of finding empty spaces and playing with intelligence,"" Easo adds.""AB is a complete package. An all-round sportsman,"" Aaron adds.Easo understands his son's need for expanding his repertoire. After serving with the Hyderabad Police from 1995 to 2008, Easo transitioned to the corporate world.That journey of discipline, change and persistence shaped the way he raised his son.With the U-19 World Cup approaching, preparation is meticulous — mental conditioning and yellow fever vaccinations. Aaron knows everyone has off days. What matters is the response.The Asia Cup gave a glimpse of his potential. Nair believes the U-19 World Cup in Zimbabwe and Namibia next month could reveal Aaron's complete package.","Aaron George was the captain of India's U-19 side at the Asia Cup in Dubai. He scored 373 runs in five matches at a striking rate of 145, steering Hyderabad to the Vinoo Mankad Trophy title.

“I have the most incredible wife”: Aaron Rodgers’ heartfelt words about his wife deepen the mystery around his private life,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/i-have-the-most-incredible-wife-aaron-rodgers-heartfelt-words-about-his-wife-deepen-the-mystery-around-his-private-life/articleshow/126092814.cms,"Aaron Rodgers has confirmed he is married but continues to keep his wife, Brittani, completely out of the public eye. His heartfelt comments describing her as “incredible” have fueled curiosity, especially with no photos or appearances to confirm her identity. Rodgers’ rare openness highlights a deeply private love story unfolding away from the spotlight.

Why Aaron Rodgers’ quiet love story continues to fascinate fans

Aaron Rodgers is not only a great quarterback in the NFL, he is also among the most discussed players of the league as he is controversial due to his frankness, individuality, and weirdness in his approach to fame.In early 2025, the Pittsburgh Steelers star stated that he was married but did not want people to know much about his wife. Her name is Brittani, but even after months of curiosity, she has not been seen. She has no photos, no appearances in the media, no social media posts. Such silence has only given people increased curiosity which has turned the personal life of Rodgers into one of the most confusing off-field stories of the NFL.Pittsburgh Steelers star Aaron Rodgers shocked fans in December 2024 when he announced that Brittani was his girlfriend on The Pat McAfee Show. June 2025, the interest increased when he visited the Steelers facility wearing a wedding ring and this confirmed they were married although he had failed to announce it publicly but Rodgers offered no public details.However, during Steelers training camp in July, Rodgers opened up emotionally in an interview with NFL Network, offering his clearest insight yet into his marriage.“When you meet the right one, and you’re with the right one, your whole world changes in a second,” he said. “And to have that person that unconditionally loves you behind the scenes, there's no better feeling in the world, and I have the most incredible wife. I just really love her.”Rodgers did not talk a lot or idealize his relationship. He instead concentrated more on emotional foundation, support and personal development as Brittani proves that she maintains things in the background..Aaron Rodgers puts a stark contrast between his image in the public and his personal tranquility by maintaining the privacy of his marriage. When being seen can be a way of being proven correct, Aaron Rodgers has proven to be the best player in the game and has shown that sometimes being silent and not showing everything is best.Also Read: Aaron Rodgers’ mystery marriage raises questions after Olivia Munn reveals what she endured","Pittsburgh Steelers star Aaron Rodgers shocked fans in December 2024 when he announced that Brittani was his girlfriend on The Pat McAfee Show.

Inside story of why Shubman Gill was DROPPED from India T20I World Cup squad

Poll Do you believe Pakistan can recreate India's recent white-ball cricket success? Yes, with the right strategies. No, it will take more time.

Senior Pakistan selector and National Cricket Academy head Aaqib Javed has made a candid revelation, admitting that he has closely followed India's recent success in white-ball cricket in an effort to rebuild and strengthen Pakistan's own cricketing structure.Speaking on a Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) podcast, the former fast bowler said India's sustained dominance across tournaments offered clear lessons for any cricketing nation serious about long-term success. “I have looked at India's success and have tried to execute plans for the betterment of Pakistan cricket,” Aaqib said. “Any cricket nation's success is based on the quality of its talent.”India have enjoyed a golden run in recent years, winning the T20 World Cup in the Caribbean last year, the Champions Trophy in Dubai earlier this year, and the Asia Cup in September — a tournament where they defeated Pakistan in the final. Aaqib believes such consistency stems from systems rather than individuals.“I think we fell away in doing the basic things correctly in our cricket system,” Aaqib admitted. “No matter who you appoint as captain, coach or selector, unless you have quality talent, nothing changes.”He stressed that talent development depends on strong infrastructure and competition. “Quality of talent can be assured by increasing bench strength and competition, and this is only possible with proper infrastructure and system,” he said.Despite past shortcomings, Aaqib expressed optimism about the current direction of Pakistan cricket. Looking ahead to the T20 World Cup early next year in India and Sri Lanka, he said the timing could not be better. “Indications are all there. We have good players, they have combined well and importantly there is a choice of players now.”He added that playing all their matches in Sri Lanka would work in Pakistan's favour. “If the World Cup had been in Australia or South Africa, I would have thought differently. But this is the best time for the team to do well.”Aaqib also highlighted the growing depth in domestic cricket and the Pakistan Shaheens setup, claiming “three to four players are ready” for international cricket. However, he emphasised that modern talent goes beyond skill alone. “Nowadays, talent is also about mental strength because players are constantly under scrutiny.”Addressing criticism, Aaqib was blunt. “The criticism is an aftershock; it only comes after a poor performance. Why should I mind it?” he said. “The only way you can avoid being criticised is to do well.”",Aaqib Javed admits he has followed India's recent success in white-ball cricket in an effort to rebuild and strengthen Pakistan's own cricketing structure.

Poll How important is Hardik Pandya for India's chances in the next T20 World Cup? Very important Somewhat important Not very important

The low of 2024, and the high

MUMBAI: The recently concluded T20I series against South Africa, which India won 3–1, once again underlined why Hardik Pandya is India’s Most Valuable Player in the T20 format. The series also marked the premier allrounder’s rousing comeback from a quadriceps injury that had kept him out of the Indian team for nearly two-and-a-half months.Using his bat like an axe, Pandya bludgeoned 142 runs in four matches at an average of 71.00 and a strike rate of 186.84, with two fifties. He also chipped in with three wickets at 38.00, conceding runs at an economy rate of 10.36. In the first T20I at Cuttack, the Baroda man smashed an unbeaten 59 off 28 balls and returned figures of 1 for 16 in two overs to play a key role in India’s 101-run win. On Friday night, he cracked a 16-ball fifty — the second-fastest by an Indian in T20Is.While India produced several fine individual performances in their 30-run win over South Africa in the fifth and final T20I at the Narendra Modi Stadium, Pandya was the standout performer.His power-packed 63 off 25 balls, featuring five sixes and five fours, left the Proteas completely flattened. Later, he also dismissed the dangerous Dewald Brevis, conceding 41 runs in three overs, and was rightly adjudged Player of the Match.South Africa head coach Shukri Conrad, unaware that the Player of the Series award had gone to Varun Chakravarthy, remarked during the postmatch press conference that he would be “surprised” if Pandya did not win the honour.“If I were brutally honest, in taking nothing away from Bumrah, I think Hardik’s been the difference between the two teams. His knock tonight was the difference between us winning and losing. He played a knock in the first one as well, where he just walked in and we had him in a little bit of trouble,” Conrad said.“There’s a reason why he’s one of the best in the world in this format. His performances have been right up there. I don’t know who the Player of the Series is, but I’d be very surprised if it’s not him,” he added.A source close to Pandya offered an insight into the 32-year-old's mindset. “Post his injury, Pandya spent almost 40 days recovering at the BCCI’s Centre of Excellence in Bengaluru. His mindset is sort of ‘lethal’ right now. He’s totally focused on the World Cup,” the source said.Pandya could have played the ODI series against South Africa, but it was decided at the CoE to ease him back through the T20 format, considering his injury history. He also featured in two Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy matches for Baroda in Hyderabad. In his first competitive game since late Sept, he smashed 77 off 42 balls to help Baroda chase down 223 against Punjab.With skipper Suryakumar Yadav out of form, and modern greats Virat Kohli , Rohit Sharma and Ravindra Jadeja having retired from T20Is, India will bank heavily on Pandya, Abhishek Sharma, Bumrah and Varun Chakravarthy as they seek to defend their title at the 2026 T20 World Cup in February–March.Pandya was among the key architects of India’s triumph in the 2024 T20 World Cup in the West Indies and the USA. He produced a superb all-round performance, scoring 144 runs in eight matches at 48.00 and taking 11 wickets at 17.36, shrugging off a difficult IPL season earlier that year where he was booed by MI fans. “Though he didn’t have a great IPL, I was confident as a selector that he and Axar Patel would deliver for us in the World Cup,” former India pacer and selector Salil Ankola told TOI. “He’s a tough cookie and a world-class player,” he added.","Hardik Pandya is India’s Most Valuable Player in the T20 format.

Why Rohit Sharma got really emotional at a promotional event

South Africa have long been known for chasing the impossible. They still hold the world record for the highest successful run chase in ODI cricket, when they hunted down 438 vs Australia. But 12 years ago at the Wanderers, they came within touching distance of pulling off something even more extraordinary in Test cricket.Set a target of 458 against India on a cracked, uneven surface, South Africa began the fifth day with far more modest ambitions. Needing 320 runs with eight wickets in hand, a draw or an India win felt like the realistic outcome. Few could have imagined that by the final hour, victory would be within reach for the Proteas.Early wickets shifted the balance back towards India, but then Faf du Plessis and AB de Villiers came together with clarity and purpose. Time at the crease mattered more than the scoreboard. What followed was a partnership built on patience, courage and immense control.For almost four hours, the pair batted with discipline on a pitch that offered variable bounce and plenty of movement. They faced 375 deliveries together and added 205 runs, taking South Africa from 197 for 4, still 261 away, to the brink of a historic chase.Cracks opened up, balls reared up and down, edges flew over the slips, but both batters absorbed it all and kept moving forward.By the final session, the equation had shifted dramatically. South Africa needed 66 runs from 15 overs with both batters unbeaten on hundreds. The chase was suddenly real.Against the flow of the game, Ishant Sharma struck. De Villiers chopped on from a back-of-a-length delivery, giving India an opening. JP Duminy followed soon after, inside-edging a cover drive. Momentum swung again when du Plessis was run out, exhausted after a long innings, following a magnificent direct hit from Ajinkya Rahane With 20 runs needed and the score reading 438, the dream was still alive. But only Vernon Philander and Dale Steyn remained, with an injured Morne Morkel and Imran Tahir unable to contribute meaningfully with the bat. Safety became the priority. Philander and Steyn blocked, left and survived. Steyn even sent the final ball of Mohammed Shami into the stands for a huge six, but it came too late. South Africa finished just eight runs short, securing one of the greatest draws the game has seen.It felt intense, dramatic and strangely anti-climactic all at once. A draw had been the morning goal, yet victory slipped away by the narrowest of margins.While du Plessis and de Villiers defined the day, the Test also marked an important chapter for India. Batting first, India were bowled out for 280, with Virat Kohli standing tall with a superb 119. Ajinkya Rahane was the next best scorer with 47. In reply, South Africa made 244, led by captain Graeme Smith’s 68, while Vernon Philander provided crucial lower-order support with a valuable 59. Zaheer Khan and Ishant Sharma picked up four wickets each.India then batted again with a slender lead of 36. Although Shikhar Dhawan fell cheaply for 15, Murali Vijay scored 39 and added 70 for the second wicket with Cheteshwar Pujara . Pujara went on to play a brilliant innings of 153 and then added 222 runs with Virat Kohli, who agonisingly missed out on a century by just four runs. India were all out for 421, setting South Africa a daunting target of 458. In the chase, Alviro Petersen’s 76 and Graeme Smith’s 44 laid a strong foundation with an opening stand of 108 before the first wicket fell.After the match, du Plessis reflected on the escape, saying: “If you had asked us this morning whether we would have taken saving the game, we definitely would have taken it. I was struggling a bit with cramps and some stomach aches too, which I don’t normally get. I was thinking about Adelaide. I knew I had done it before and I just placed a very high price on my wicket and made sure the Indians found it difficult to get me. The wicket was just a blur. In hindsight, I should have been out there holding one end while Vern went and took it on. India bowled very skilfully.”Virat Kohli was named Player of the Match for scores of 119 and 96. Cheteshwar Pujara showcased his class with a commanding 153 in the second innings. It was a period of transition, the first major overseas assignment for Kohli, Pujara and Rahane as a group.India lost the series 1-0 and went down by 10 wickets in the second Test, but they discovered something lasting. Kohli, Pujara and Rahane finished as the three highest run scorers in the series. Pujara made 280 runs at an average of 70. Kohli followed with 272 at 68. Rahane added 209 at 69.66. Together, they would go on to shape India’s batting for the next decade.Twelve years on, that final day at the Wanderers remains unforgettable.","Faf du Plessis and AB de Villiers came together with clarity and purpose.

Inside details of how MS Dhoni is training for IPL 2026 in Ranchi

Ex-India cricketer Amit Mishra has chosen reflection over resentment while revisiting the long-standing discussion around his relationship with Mahendra Singh Dhoni “People say if Dhoni was not there my career would have been better,” Mishra said. “But who knows if he was not there maybe I would not even have been in the team.”For Mishra, the beginning of his India journey itself is tied closely to Dhoni. “I came into the team under him only,” he said. “And I kept making a comeback. He would have agreed as a captain and that is why I kept coming back. So there is a positive way to look at things.”The idea that Dhoni consistently preferred other spin options never left him feeling ignored. “I did have the support,” Mishra said. “Whenever I was in the XI, it was never like Dhoni did not come to me and give me tips or tell me things. He would always tell me things.”One memory, in particular, still stands out from his playing days. “I was playing against New Zealand, which was my last one-day series. Dhoni was the captain,” Mishra recalled. “It was a tight game. We had scored 260–270 runs. I came to bowl and I thought of stopping the flow of runs and not going for wickets.”That approach, however, did not sit well with his captain. “After a couple of overs, Dhoni came to me and told me I am not bowling what I naturally bowl,” Mishra said. “He told me not to think a lot and bowl what I always do.”The advice was brief but decisive. “He told me, this is your bowling. Bowl exactly this. Don’t think a lot,” Mishra said.The impact was immediate. “I did that and then got a wicket,” he said. “It was a game-changing spell. I picked up five wickets, and I think that was also my best spell.”For Mishra, Dhoni’s clarity came from a simple understanding of the game situation. “His thinking was that if I did not pick wickets, we would lose the game,” Mishra said. “This is how he supported me.”That backing helped Mishra make the most of his opportunities whenever they came. Across 22 Tests, he took 76 wickets. In 36 ODIs, he claimed 64 wickets, including a memorable six-wicket haul. In 10 T20Is, he added 16 more wickets, often stepping up despite irregular selection.Looking back now, Mishra sees no reason for regret. “If Dhoni was not there, maybe I would not even have been in the team,” he said. “That’s the positive way to look at things.”","Amit Mishra has chosen reflection over resentment while revisiting the long- standing discussion around his relationship with Mahendra Singh Dhoni. “If Dhoni was not there, maybe I would not even have been in the team,” he said.

Why Rohit Sharma got really emotional at a promotional event

Indian leg-spinner Yuzvendra Chahal grabbed attention on social media after sharing a personal moment on Monday. If the post made by the 35-year-old cricketer is believed to be true, he has bought a new luxury BMW car ahead of IPL 2026.The post quickly went viral, not because of the car alone, but because of the message he shared with it.Chahal bought a BMW Z4 M40i, which reportedly costs around Rs 1.06 crore on the road.He shared pictures of the new car and showed that his parents were present during the special moment. For Chahal, their presence meant more than the expensive vehicle itself.Sharing his feelings on X (formerly Twitter), Chahal wrote, “Brought my new car home with the two people who made every dream possible. Watching my parents witness and relish this milestone is the real luxury.”The post touched many fans as they praised him for valuing family over material success.Chahal was retained by Punjab Kings ahead of the IPL 2026 auction.However, on the national team front, he has not played for India since 2023. And despite being out of favour at the international level, he remains an important name in domestic cricket and the IPL.Recently, Chahal also revealed that he was diagnosed with dengue and chikungunya Because of this, he had to miss the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy final between Haryana and Jharkhand. His absence proved costly for Haryana, who struggled in the match and lost by 69 runs.In that final, Jharkhand lifted their maiden Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy title, led by a brilliant century from Ishan Kishan.","Yuzvendra Chahal bought a BMW Z4 M40i, which reportedly costs around Rs 1.06 crore on the road.

Sam Curran: 'People like it, people hate it, if you're a good team, you don't need an Impact Player'

Former England cricket chief Andrew Strauss has spoken out after England’s latest Ashes defeat in Australia. He believes that simply removing head coach Brendon McCullum or captain Ben Stokes will not fix England’s long-standing problems in Australian conditions.Strauss knows what it takes to win in Australia. He was the last England captain to win an Ashes series there, leading his team to a 3-1 victory in 2010/11.Since then, England’s record has been very poor. They have lost 16 Test matches and managed only two draws in Australia.England are once again under pressure after going 3-0 down in the current Ashes series, with two matches still to play.Many fans and experts are questioning the leadership of McCullum and Stokes. However, Strauss has warned against quick and emotional decisions.In a long post on LinkedIn, Strauss reflected on England’s latest failure. He wrote, ""So there it is, another ambitious set of England cricketers made the journey to Australia, full of hope and optimism, only for their dreams to come crashing down around them after only 11 days of cricket.""Strauss said McCullum and Stokes will face heavy criticism, just like previous England coaches and leaders did after past Ashes defeats.""McCullum and Stokes will come under extreme scrutiny for the decisions they took in preparation for this tour in the same way that (Ashley) Giles and (Chris) Silverwood did after the last tour. And Andy Flower after 2013/14 and Duncan Fletcher after 2006/07,"" he further added.Strauss stressed that the blame should not fall on a few individuals.He noted, ""While they will know that this goes with the territory, none of the above are responsible for England losing so incredibly consistently in Australia since 1986/87. We have been badly mauled time after time over there because Australia are a better team, served by a better high-performance system.""He ended by calling for real change, saying, ""If we are genuinely serious about changing this depressingly one-sided story, then we need to look beyond sacking England coaches and captains and ask whether we are genuinely willing to make the changes necessary to break the trend.""","Former England cricket chief Andrew Strauss has spoken out after England’s latest Ashes defeat in Australia.

Poll Do you think Aston Villa can win the Premier League this season? Yes, they have a strong chance No, they will fall short Not sure yet They need to improve further

Aston Villa continued their stunning Premier League title charge on Sunday as Morgan Rogers’ brilliant brace sealed a 2-1 victory over Manchester United at a raucous Villa Park, extending Unai Emery’s side’s extraordinary winning run.Rogers put Villa ahead late in the first half with a moment of individual brilliance before restoring the lead after the break, his goals securing a 10th consecutive victory in all competitions and keeping the Midlands club firmly in the title conversation.Third-placed Villa now sit just three points behind leaders Arsenal and one adrift of Manchester City, chasing what would be their first English league title since 1981. Their current run is their best in all competitions since 1914, while seven straight top-flight wins marks their strongest league streak since the 1989-90 season.Villa’s rise has been remarkable given their dismal start to the campaign, when they collected just two points and scored a single goal from their opening five matches — their worst beginning for 28 years. Under Emery, however, Villa Park has become a fortress, with only one Premier League home defeat in 2025, fewer than any other side.Even Manchester United, who had lost just once in their previous 26 visits to Villa, could not halt Emery’s momentum. United briefly responded after Villa’s opener, Matheus Cunha finishing clinically after Matty Cash gifted possession on the stroke of half-time.But the loss of captain Bruno Fernandes to an apparent hamstring injury at the interval proved decisive. Already depleted by injuries, suspension and Africa Cup of Nations absences, Ruben Amorim’s side lacked control after the break.Villa regained the lead in the 57th minute when Rogers showed greater hunger than Leny Yoro, pouncing on a loose ball in the box and finishing confidently for his sixth goal in as many league appearances. Emery celebrated wildly on the touchline, tossing his jacket skywards as Villa closed in on another statement win.United had chances to respond, with Emiliano Martinez producing key saves and Cunha wasting a gilt-edged header, but Villa held firm. Amorim handed a debut to teenager Jack Fletcher late on, yet the evening belonged to the hosts.",Aston Villa beat Manchester United 2-1 at Villa Park on Sunday.

Fans throw objects, vandalise stadium after Messi leaves early | Hyderabad next

NEW DELHI: Former India football captain Bhaichung Bhutia has strongly criticised the chaos that took place during Lionel Messi ’s public event at the Salt Lake Stadium in Kolkata.Speaking on Sunday, Bhutia called the incident unfortunate and said sports events should always be treated with importance, without unnecessary delays caused by politics or formalities.He said fans come to stadiums to enjoy the sport and watch their favourite players, not to sit through long speeches or wait for VIPs to arrive.“I think when there is a sports event, sports should get priority,” he said.He also pointed out that this problem is seen often across India. According to Bhutia, many sporting events are delayed because organisers wait for politicians or chief guests. He said such practices only harm the experience for fans and players.“Many times across India, we see sporting events getting delayed because of political speeches, chief guest handshakes and all that. That is not necessary. Fans and players are coming to watch the sport, and the sport should begin rather than waiting for VIPs.”Talking about Lionel Messi’s recent G.O.A.T. Tour of India, Bhutia said the response from fans clearly showed what people really want. He said fans in Kolkata and other cities only wanted to see Messi and enjoy the sport, without any extra drama.“It was good to see not just in Kolkata, but across different cities, fans just wanted to see the sporting event, who just wanted to see Messi and nothing else.”Bhutia hopes that what happened in Kolkata will act as a wake-up call for organisers and authorities in the future.“I hope this is a lesson we will learn and that this trend will change,” he added.The promotional event featuring Lionel Messi turned chaotic due to poor planning and crowd control.Thousands of fans were disappointed as politicians, celebrities and officials surrounded Messi, limiting his interaction with the public.His time on the field was also cut short. Frustrated by the situation, some spectators created disturbances inside the stadium.","Bhaichung Bhutia has strongly criticised the chaos that took place during Lionel Messi’s public event at the Salt Lake Stadium in Kolkata.

Erling Haaland continues to motor along at better than a goal a game for Manchester City in the Premier League His latest victim was West Ham on Saturday.The Norway striker scored in each half to move to 19 goals in 17 matches in this campaign and also set up Tijjani Reijnders' goal in a 3-0 win at Etihad Stadium on Saturday.The victory lifted City into first place, a point ahead of Arsenal before the deposed leader's match at Everton later Saturday.Haaland has 38 goals in a combined 28 games for club and country in what is shaping up to be the most prolific season of his career. Injury permitting, the season will end in him going to his first World Cup with Norway.His double gave him 104 in the Premier League, one more than Cristiano Ronaldo having played 122 games fewer.Haaland scored at the second attempt from Phil Foden's cross to give City a fifth-minute lead and took advantage of a defensive mix-up to make it 3-0 in the 69th. In between, Haaland slipped a short pass to Reijnders, who took a touch and rifled a shot into the roof of the net in the 38th.Woltemade's week What a difference a week made for Nick Woltemade.Last weekend, he scored an own-goal to consign Newcastle to a derby loss at fierce rival Sunderland.Six days later, he netted twice in the opening 20 minutes to give his team a fast start against Chelsea.Chelsea recovered, though, to draw 2-2 with Joao Pedro's equalizer coming off a rare assist from a goalkeeper.Robert Sanchez smashed a long clearance up to Pedro, who headed the ball forward and ended up collecting it himself after Fabian Schar slipped. Pedro slotted a finish underneath Newcastle goalkeeper Aaron Ramsdale to earn Chelsea a point in the 66th.""I wanted to give a good performance today and I think I did,"" Woltemade said. ""I just want to say thank you to the fans for still being good with me.""Reece James launched Chelsea's fightback by curling a free kick in off the post after halftime.Chelsea stayed in fourth place and has won only one of its last five games in the league.

Armando Broja grabbed Burnley's equalizer in the 90th.Sunderland is doing much better since promotion.

Lionel Messi India tour: Inside story of what went wrong in Kolkata

NEW DELHI: Satadru Dutta, the main organiser of Lionel Messi’s event held on December 13 and now under arrest, has told investigators that the footballer was unhappy with physical contact during his appearance at the Salt Lake Stadium and left the venue before completing the scheduled programme, news agency PTI reported on Saturday, quoting a source in the Special Investigation Team (SIT).During questioning, Dutta told SIT officers that Messi ""did not like being touched on the back or being hugged"" and that this concern had been communicated in advance by foreign security officials assigned to protect the footballer, the source said.""Despite repeated public announcements to restrain the crowd, there was no impact. The manner in which Messi was surrounded and embraced was completely unacceptable to the World Cup-winning footballer,"" Dutta told investigators during his grilling on Friday, the source added, as cited by the PTI.West Bengal sports minister Aroop Biswas was seen close to Messi during the programme, with visuals showing him holding the footballer around the waist while posing for photographs. Biswas has been accused of using his influence to allow relatives and personal acquaintances access to Messi. Amid criticism, he resigned from his post as sports minister pending completion of the investigation.Investigators are examining how a large number of people were allowed to access the ground area.Dutta claimed that initially only 150 ground passes were issued, but the number was tripled after a ""very influential person"" arrived at the stadium and ""overpowered him"". Police are checking whether the increase in access led to the crowd control failure.""The arrested accused also claimed that once that particular influential person reached the stadium, all the flow-chart for the Messi programme got disturbed and he could not control it,"" the official told PTI.Dutta also shared financial details related to Messi’s India visit. ""Lionel Messi was paid Rs 89 crore for the tour, while Rs 11 crore was paid as tax to the Indian government,"" he told investigators, putting the total cost at Rs 100 crore. Sources said 30 per cent of the amount came from sponsors and another 30 per cent from ticket sales.SIT officers also found more than Rs 20 crore in Dutta’s frozen bank accounts. On Friday, they seized several documents during raids at his residence.""Dutta claimed that the amount in his bank account was the money which he got from selling the tickets for the Messi event in Kolkata and Hyderabad and also from the sponsors. We are verifying his claims,"" the officer said.What was supposed to be a marquee football spectacle turned into widespread violence and disorder at the stadium last week after Messi’s brief and tightly ring-fenced appearance, his first at the venue since 2011, left large sections of the crowd frustrated.They failed to catch a glimpse of their superstar despite having travelled from far and wide, paying hefty sums for tickets.The West Bengal government has formed an SIT comprising senior IPS officers Piyush Pandey, Javed Shamim, Supratim Sarkar and Muralidhar to investigate the vandalism, security lapses, access violations and the role of organisers and officials in the incident, the officer added.","Satadru Dutta, the main organiser of Lionel Messi’s event held on December 13 and now under arrest, has told investigators that the footballer was unhappy with physical contact.

A trophy with a meaning

The hollow in a million hearts

A new trophy, a new start

A forgotten memory

NEW DELHI: Looking back today, it feels almost unreal that the original FIFA World Cup trophy no longer exists.In an era where constant digital tracking and tight security were absent, football lost one of its most treasured symbols quietly and permanently. The Jules Rimet Trophy, which crowned the world champions of football for four decades, was stolen in 1983 and never recovered.The Jules Rimet Trophy was the first official World Cup prize. It was awarded to the winners of the FIFA World Cup from 1930 to 1970. Named after Jules Rimet, the former FIFA president who played a key role in starting the World Cup, the trophy carried enormous historical value.It was made of solid gold and featured a sculpted figure holding a cup, making it instantly recognisable to fans across the world.For Brazil, the trophy had special meaning.The country first won the World Cup in 1958 and defended the title in 1962. Brazil won the tournament in 1970 for the third time, completing a remarkable journey.At the time, it was under FIFA rules that any country that won the World Cup three times was allowed to keep the Jules Rimet Trophy permanently.Led by football legend Pelé, Brazil’s victory in 1970 gave the nation permanent ownership of the trophy.After the celebrations ended, the Jules Rimet Trophy was placed at the headquarters of the Brazilian Football Confederation in Rio de Janeiro.It was displayed in a glass case and treated as a symbol of Brazil’s football greatness. Security arrangements were modest, reflecting a time when the idea of stealing such an object seemed unlikely.That sense of safety did not last.In December 1983, the Jules Rimet Trophy was stolen. It all happened under the night skies when thieves broke into the CBF building. They damaged the display case and took the trophy.When officials arrived later, they found that the most famous prize in football history was gone.News of the theft reached the ears of the general public soon across Brazil and beyond. In a country where football makes people fanatics, the loss was deeply felt.The trophy was not only the representation of their success on the pitch, but it also stood for generations of players and moments that shaped the sport.Brazilian police launched an investigation immediately. Over time, several suspects were arrested, including a jeweller. Investigators worked to trace the trophy and understand the motive behind the theft. Their findings pointed to a simple but devastating conclusion. The Jules Rimet Trophy was made of solid gold, and gold could be melted.According to the investigation, the trophy was melted down and sold as gold. This conclusion was based on police evidence and statements from those involved.Once melted, the trophy lost its identity completely. No markings, shapes or features remained. Not a single piece of the original Jules Rimet Trophy has ever been recovered.This was not the first time the trophy had been stolen. In 1966, ahead of the World Cup in England, the Jules Rimet Trophy disappeared from an exhibition in London.In an interesting end to the saga, the trophy was found wrapped in newspaper under a hedge by a dog named Pickles.It was soon returned safely, and the incident became part of football folklore.The 1983 theft in Brazil had no such ending.With no hope of recovery, Brazil later commissioned a replica of the Jules Rimet Trophy. The replica was placed on display to preserve the memory of Brazil’s achievement.However, it could not replace the historical value of the original trophy that had been lifted by champions from 1930 onwards.The disappearance of the Jules Rimet Trophy also influenced how football treated its prizes.After Brazil’s third World Cup win, FIFA introduced a new trophy, first awarded in 1974. The current FIFA World Cup Trophy is not permanently awarded to any nation. Winners lift the original trophy during celebrations but are later given a replica to keep. The original remains under FIFA’s control.The loss of the Jules Rimet Trophy forced FIFA to look at this rule with a strict eye.For Brazil, the theft was especially painful.The 1970 team is widely considered one of the greatest sides in football history. Players like Pelé, Jairzinho, Rivelino and others created moments that will forever be in the memories of the fans.The trophy they earned through skill and success on the field was lost through negligence and crime.The story continues to be remembered even after decades.Authorities believe they know what happened to the trophy. Yet, the sense of loss remains because the outcome cannot be reversed.Football history was erased in physical form.Today, fans can only see photographs and replicas of the Jules Rimet Trophy. Museums display its likeness, and books recount its journey. But the original, which once travelled across continents and crowned the first world champions, no longer exists.The stolen World Cup trophy stands as a reminder of a different era. It shows how even the most valuable symbols can be lost if they are not protected. It also highlights how fragile history can be.Football has moved forward since then. New trophies have been lifted, new legends have emerged, and new memories have been created. Yet the story of the Jules Rimet Trophy remains one of the sport’s most sobering chapters.It is a throwback to a time when the World Cup could disappear. And never return.","The Jules Rimet Trophy was the first official World Cup prize. It was awarded to the winners of the FIFA World Cup from 1930 to 1970. For Brazil, the trophy had special meaning. The country first won the World Cup in 1958 and defended the title in 1962. Brazil won the tournament in 1970 for the third time, completing a remarkable journey. At the time, under FIFA rules that any country that won the Cup three times was allowed to keep the trophy permanently.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126080260,imgsize-141630,width-400,resizemode-4/conmebol-holds-tribute-event-for-pel-in-doha-as-he-remains-hospitalized.jpg"

Engage with the Ministry as outlined above; and Constitute a joint working group comprising representatives of AIFF, Ministry and the Clubs to address legal, regulatory, and transitional matters, including timelines and approvals from AFC, FIFA, and the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India.""Representatives of all ISL clubs have been invited to attend the upcoming AIFF Annual General Meeting on Saturday, where the matter is expected to be discussed.","Indian Super League (ISL) clubs formally propose a fundamental restructuring of the country's top-tier professional football league.

At least 59 people, including seven police officers, were injured after violent clashes erupted between rival football supporters following Colombia’s Copa Colombia final in Medellin on Wednesday night, authorities said, in scenes that overshadowed Atletico Nacional’s title triumph.The unrest broke out moments after the final whistle at the Atanasio Girardot Stadium, where Atletico Nacional edged past city rivals Deportivo Independiente Medellin 1-0 to lift the trophy. What should have been a night of celebration quickly descended into chaos as fans from both sides stormed the pitch, hurled projectiles and clashed with security forces.Videos of the violence circulated widely on social media, showing dozens of supporters invading the field and confrontations breaking out in different sections of the stadium. Riot police were forced to intervene to restore order as the situation spiralled out of control in front of a crowd of around 43,000 spectators.Medellin’s security secretary Manuel Villa confirmed that 52 fans were treated for injuries sustained during the clashes, while police said seven officers were also hurt. No arrests were reported, but Villa said authorities were reviewing CCTV footage from inside and around the stadium to identify those responsible.The violence had immediate consequences for the event, with officials cancelling the post-match trophy presentation and medal ceremony for Atletico Nacional players due to safety concerns.In Colombia, visiting fans are typically barred from attending high-risk fixtures to prevent crowd trouble. However, Medellin city hall had allowed Atletico Nacional supporters — officially designated as the visiting side — to attend the final as part of an initiative to promote peaceful coexistence in football.Medellin mayor Federico Gutierrez strongly condemned the incidents, describing those involved as “criminals” and “misfits” who do not represent the sport.","At least 59 people, including seven police officers, were injured after violent clashes erupted following Colombia’s Copa Colombia final.

PARIS: Paris Saint-Germain goalkeeper Matvey Safonov has been left with a fractured hand following his penalty shootout heroics to win the Intercontinental Cup.Safonov made four straight penalty saves as PSG beat Brazil's Flamengo 2-1 in the shootout on Wednesday to secure the club's first global title. He was thrown in the air by his teammates during the celebrations.PSG said Friday that Safonov has a fracture in his left hand and that “his situation will be re-evaluated” after three or four weeks.“I can’t explain anything, it’s incredible. The player doesn’t know how it happened,” coach Luis Enrique said in translated comments Friday.He added that the most plausible explanation seemed to be that Safonov was hurt during the shootout and kept playing with the fracture.In a video posted on social media app Telegram, Safonov didn't address what happened directly, but said: “You know, no matter what happens, I can't be broken.”Safonov, PSG’s Russian backup goalkeeper, hadn’t played a single minute for the team until summer signing Lucas Chevalier sustained an ankle injury which has ruled him out since his last game Nov. 29.Chevalier was on the bench against Flamengo.

NEW DELHI: The Indian Super League (ISL) clubs were on Thursday asked to submit a proposal for forming a consortium to run the 2025-26 season of the league, which is yet to begin.Representatives of all ISL clubs were invited to attend the Annual General Meeting of the All India Football Federation on Saturday, on the sidelines of which the matter was discussed.“Regarding the consortium thing, the clubs have been told to submit to the ministry their proposal so that it can be discussed during the Dec 20 AGM. But there is no guarantee,” a club representative told news agency PTI.The request followed a virtual meeting on Thursday between AIFF officials, ISL club representatives and the sports ministry. The clubs were asked to submit their proposal by Friday evening.The AIFF also informed the clubs that, under its new constitution, any amendment to its provisions could be done only after the General Body of the national federation was formed according to the new constitution itself.“It could be hotchpotch also since the new National Sports Grievance Act is likely to be implemented shortly. So there can be changes under the Act also,” a source in the know of things said.Meanwhile, the Indian Women’s League, starting December 20, will be held without a sponsor after the AIFF and Capri Sports – the lone bidder in the national federation’s tender to monetise the commercial rights of the first and second divisions of the IWL for five years – could not reach an agreement.The clubs had earlier suggested forming a consortium to resolve the ongoing commercial impasse in Indian football.The AIFF said this would require deliberations and approval by its Executive Committee and the AGM.The Marketing Rights Agreement between the AIFF and Football Sports Development Limited, which organised the ISL for 12 seasons since its inception in 2014, ended on December 8, leaving the top-tier league without a commercial framework.","Indian Super League (ISL) clubs were on Thursday asked to submit a proposal for forming a consortium to run the 2025-26 season of the league, which is yet to begin.

NEW DELHI: Today is December 18. For some, it is just another day on the way to Christmas and the New Year. For football fans, however, it is a date that will forever live in the sport’s collective memory as the night Lionel Messi completed the game.Under the bright lights of Lusail Stadium in Qatar three years back, Argentina defeated France in a final that felt less like a match and more like destiny unfolding in real time.For Messi, it was not just a World Cup title; it was the closing chapter of a lifelong pursuit that had defined his career, his country, and an entire generation of football fans.For nearly two decades, Messi’s greatness had been measured against an absence.He had won everything at club level, from Champions League to multiple Ballon d’Ors, league titles and goal-scoring records that once seemed untouchable.And yet, the World Cup remained the one prize that eluded him, the yardstick by which football immortality is often judged.In Argentina, where Diego Maradona ’s shadow still loomed large, that absence was felt more sharply than anywhere else.Qatar 2022 began with doubt rather than certainty. Argentina’s shocking opening defeat to Saudi Arabia threatened to derail the campaign before it truly began.For a brief moment, old fears resurfaced: was this another World Cup destined to end in heartbreak for Messi?But what followed was a team and a captain refusing to surrender to narrative or pressure.Messi led with calm authority. He scored, he created, he inspired, and, perhaps most importantly, he believed.From the group stages to the knockout rounds, Argentina grew stronger with each game, feeding off Messi’s composure and clarity. Against Australia, the Netherlands, and Croatia, he was not just a playmaker but the emotional compass of the side, guiding younger teammates through moments of chaos and tension.Then came the final: Argentina versus France, Messi versus Kylian Mbappé, experience versus explosive youth. It was billed as a passing-of-the-torch moment, but Messi was not ready to hand anything over.He scored from the penalty spot to give Argentina the lead and later added a second, arriving in the box with perfect timing to finish off a flowing move. At 2–0, it seemed as though the dream was finally within reach.Football, however, rarely allows fairy tales to unfold without resistance. In a breathtaking twist, Mbappé struck twice in the space of minutes to drag France back into the contest.Extra time followed, and Messi once again stepped up, poking the ball home to make it 3–2. Still, France refused to yield. Mbappé completed his hat-trick from the penalty spot, forcing a shootout that felt almost unbearable in its tension.As penalties loomed, the weight of history hung heavy. Argentina had been here before. It was close, but not close enough. This time, though, the script was different.Emiliano Martínez produced heroics in goal, Argentine penalties were struck with conviction, and when Gonzalo Montiel converted the decisive kick, Messi dropped to his knees, overcome with emotion.Tears flowed freely.Teammates swarmed him. In that moment, the burden he had carried for so long seemed to lift. The image of Messi, draped in the black bisht as he raised the World Cup trophy, became instantly iconic.For Argentina, the victory healed old wounds. It united generations that had debated Messi’s place in the pantheon and finally allowed him to be celebrated without caveats.For Messi himself, it was redemption, validation, and closure all at once.He had not just won a World Cup; he had done so as the undisputed leader of the team, delivering when it mattered most.Two years on, the significance of that night has only grown.December 18 is no longer just a date on the football calendar. It is the day Lionel Messi stepped beyond comparison, beyond debate, and into footballing eternity; World Cup in hand, legacy complete.","Lionel Messi won the FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022 trophy on December 18, 2013.

Who is Philip Rivers’ wife Tiffany?



Philip Rivers’ return to the NFL at age 44 with the Indianapolis Colts has reignited conversations not just about his remarkable career but also about the enduring partnership that has shaped him off the field. From middle school sweethearts in Alabama to parents of ten, they have come a long way. Philip often credits Tiffany for helping him stay grounded, saying, “We’re best friends. That to me has been the key. Whenever it gets kind of crazy, we’ll figure it out together. She’s awesome.”Their connection blossomed early. Philip remembers noticing Tiffany at a young age and being drawn to her character, recalling, “With Tiffany, I remember pointing her out at a ballgame at the ball field when I was young. But I remember telling my mom, ‘Hey Mom, see that girl over there, she’s a good girl. And she was centered on faith and Christ. She had those values that I was looking for.’” Their shared values guided them through high school, college, and eventually into marriage at ages 19 and 18. Tiffany converted to Catholicism the day before their wedding, embracing Philip’s faith as they built a life centered on God and family.Tiffany Rivers is more than just the quarterback’s partner.Beyond managing a bustling household of ten children, she co-founded Hermoza, a swimwear brand that prioritizes modesty and practicality over trend-driven fashion. She has consistently demonstrated her commitment to philanthropy, co-launching the Rivers of Hope Foundation with Philip in 2009 to support foster and orphaned children. Their charity work continues privately through initiatives like the Rivers of Hope Birthday Club and Camp Connect, which helps reunite siblings separated in foster care.Philip often highlights Tiffany’s active role in nurturing faith and family life. On the “Saints in the Parish” podcast, he shared vivid memories of her bringing their children to visit him during NFL games. He described teammates’ reactions: seeing “a 2-year-old, 4-year-old, 6-year-old, and 8-year-old running around and Tiffany coming in carrying one and then running and playing and laughing,” made a lasting impression. He also pointed to Tiffany’s leadership in family prayer practices, including rosaries and a “prayer jar” for children to draw intentions from.Through it all, their marriage reflects a balance of love, faith, and friendship. Philip notes, “It’s awesome. Tiffany is awesome. It doesn’t matter if it’s the first child or the 10th child. It’s an awesome miracle every time. Everyone is home now, and everyone is good.” For Philip Rivers, Tiffany is not just his wife; she is the heart of his family and the anchor that has guided him through life, both on and off the field.Also Read: Josh Allen and Hailee Steinfeld’s lavish holiday gift for Bills linemen has fans calling him the ultimate teammate","Tiffany and Philip Rivers are the parents of ten children.

Paul Rudd Kansas City Chiefs fan embraces perspective over disappointment



Paul Rudd on Why Jack Black is The Best, Worst Auditions, Chiefs Fandom & Naming Your Nuts | EP 171

Paul Rudd has never hidden his loyalty to the Kansas City Chiefs, but his latest comments reveal a deeper, more reflective side of fandom. After Travis Kelce publicly apologized to him for the team’s difficult season, the actor chose gratitude over frustration. Speaking on the Dec. 22 episode of New Heights, Rudd framed the setback as part of a larger emotional journey, one shaped by family, memories, and years of winning that reshaped what it means to be a devoted supporter.For Paul Rudd, Kansas City Chiefs fandom is less about a single season and more about shared experiences. Those Sunday rituals, the highs, the heartbreaks, and the moments passed down to his kids have created a bond that outlasts the standings. Even as playoff hopes faded, his perspective remained steady, grounded in appreciation rather than entitlement.“As a Chiefs fan, I am so happy to be a Chiefs fan,” Paul, 56, said during the Dec. 22 episode of New Heights with Jason and Travis Kelce. “The joy and the memories and everything that the Chiefs have given me with my family, with my kid, it’s been an embarrassment of riches.”That mindset carried through as he addressed the team’s elimination from playoff contention, ending a historic run of dominance.Instead of dwelling on what went wrong, Rudd opened space for other fanbases to feel that same thrill Kansas City supporters have known for years. “You know what, this wasn’t the year, but that’s OK,” he continued. “I know it’s tough. I’m excited for whoever does it for their fanbase.”His thoughts also turned personal when discussing Patrick Mahomes, who suffered a torn ACL during the Dec. 14 game. “I’m thinking about Patrick,” Paul added. “I’m wishing him a speedy recovery and everything for the club and I’m OK.”Even humor found its way into the conversation as Rudd looked ahead to the offseason. With Kansas City accustomed to deep playoff runs, he saw value in rest and recovery for a roster that has carried an extra workload. “I’m excited for some of the players to get maybe a little bit of a summer vacation,” the Clueless star joked. “I mean, my God. It’s like you’ve played an extra season of football compared to everyone else. And so I’m like, ‘Oh good you get a break, a chance to kind of rest up. ’”As he summed it up plainly, “I’m not too upset.”Also Read: Josh Allen and Hailee Steinfeld’s lavish holiday gift for Bills linemen has fans calling him the ultimate teammate","Paul Rudd has never hidden his loyalty to the Kansas City Chiefs.

Why Josh Allen’s “everybody eats” philosophy made his offensive line’s holiday season unforgettable



Josh Allen offensive line gift stories usually surface quietly in locker rooms. This one landed with a thud on social media and instantly felt different. At a time when holiday gestures often lean flashy, the Buffalo Bills quarterback chose something personal, practical, and deeply rooted in team culture. As the playoffs approach, Josh Allen offensive line gift choices reveal more than generosity. They show trust, gratitude, and a shared grind built in the trenches.The moment became public not through a press release, but through a candid TikTok video that captured genuine surprise. Alysha Monet, wife of Bills offensive tackle Alec Anderson, let fans peek behind the curtain. The gift was not symbolic. It was substantial. It also carried the quiet message that protection up front matters every single snap.Monet opened her video with heartfelt honesty, saying, ""One of my favorite parts about this time of year is gift giving. I think it's really cool to see all the gifts the guys get each other, so I'm going to show you guys the gift Josh got for all the O-Linemen because it's so sweet."" The reveal followed quickly. Allen and his wife, Hailee Steinfeld, gifted each lineman a quarter of a cow.Bags of premium cuts filled the room as Anderson helped narrate the moment.Monet could barely hide her disbelief. ""I feel like this is something we've always wanted to get for ourselves. So I don't know how he knew we would want this!"" She went on to list wagyu, filet, chuck eye, skirt steak, ground beef, and more, calling it ""the insane amount of different cuts of meat."" The gift even required a last-minute deep freezer purchase. ""This is so dope. We actually had to go and buy a deep freezer from the store right now just to put all this meat in, but we're so grateful to Hailee and Josh. They are the sweetest people ever and this is such a good, functional gift.""The generosity did not stop with the meat. Allen and Steinfeld also included an infrared steak searer so every lineman could cook it properly. As Monet explained, ""Pretty much he got something for everyone to be able to cook all this meat. Thought this was cool to share with all you guys."" She closed the video with quiet gratitude, saying, ""Absolutely such a special time of the year. So grateful.""Quarterbacks have long taken care of their linemen, from luxury watches to golf gear. Patrick Mahomes has famously gone big with high-end watches, smart training kits, and travel upgrades. Allen’s approach stands apart because it feels grounded. It fits Buffalo’s identity and the team’s “everybody eats” mantra.With the Bills chasing another postseason run, this gesture carries weight beyond the holidays. It signals unity, respect, and a quarterback who understands where games are truly won. In Buffalo, that message came packed in steak cuts and shared appreciation.Also Read: George Kittle’s wife Claire reveals the behind-the-scenes game day secrets that make 49ers watch parties unforgettable","Josh Allen and his wife, Hailee Steinfeld, gifted each lineman a quarter of a cow.

Claire Kittle game day routine sets the tone beyond kickoff



San Francisco 49ers Sundays have a second spotlight that rarely shows up on stat sheets. While George Kittle battles defenders, Claire Kittle turns game day into a shared experience that feels part celebration, part tradition. The Claire Kittle game day routine has grown into its own ritual, one shaped by early mornings, careful planning, and an instinct for bringing people together. From the stands, she adds rhythm to the roar, blending football passion with a sense of welcome that fans recognize instantly.That presence now carries beyond Levi’s Stadium. Claire has stepped into a larger role this season, partnering with Smirnoff as part of the brand’s We Do Game Days campaign. For someone who treats football Sundays as an all-day event, the alignment feels natural. She does not frame game day as a single kickoff moment. She frames it as a story that unfolds hour by hour, fueled by people, preparation, and atmosphere.Claire sees football Sundays as layered experiences, not short bursts of action. As she told PEOPLE, “Game days are so much more than just the game: it's about 'fits, who's in town, who traveled here.”Those details shape how the day feels long before the first snap. She explained, “We do so many fun things pre-game, at the game, post-game ... Smirnoff has always been that and it's at the center of all of those things.”The schedule often surprises outsiders. Claire says the day starts far earlier than fans expect, with strict timing and early departures. “The timing of the day” stands out most to newcomers, especially “how early we leave the house and drive to the stadium,” she says. “We are at the stadium two hours before kickoff.” That structure allows her to manage a long stretch of energy, hosting friends and family throughout the day.Inside the suite at Levi’s Stadium, Claire leads without forcing the moment. She creates space for others to shine. “I feel like we have a lot of life-of-the-parties in our group, and it could be anybody on any given Sunday,” she says. “We'll always have one or two really good ring leaders, good party members. That's always at the forefront.” The approach keeps things light, even during tense moments on the field.Music plays a central role. Claire credits her brother Riley Till with setting the emotional pace. “It's a very vital role when we're on the bus and we're going to the game,” she tells PEOPLE. “He's got to know what to play, when to play it and for how long, so that always sets the tone as well.” In those details, Claire shows that game day magic often happens far from the end zone.Also Read: Patriots QB Drake Maye addresses rumors and attention surrounding wife Ann Michael ahead of high-stakes Sunday Night Football clash",Claire Kittle is the wife of San Francisco 49ers tight end George Kittle.

DK Metcalf suspension: How many games will the Steelers WR miss following his heated altercation with Lions fan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/dk-metcalf-suspension-how-many-games-will-the-steelers-wr-miss-following-his-heated-altercation-with-lions-fan/articleshow/126131164.cms,"DK Metcalf 2-game suspension (Getty Images)

DK Metcalf suspension exposes a rare and costly NFL precedent



The moment unfolded in seconds, but the consequences for DK Metcalf will linger deep into the Steelers’ playoff push. What began as a heated exchange along the sideline in Detroit has now turned into one of the most severe fan related punishments the NFL has handed down in recent years. For a league obsessed with image, order, and crowd control, the decision sends a loud message that lines cannot be crossed, no matter the provocation.For DK Metcalf, the suspension lands at the worst possible time. Pittsburgh is fighting for postseason life, juggling tiebreakers, and weighing whether each snap in the final two weeks will define its season. The absence of a physical, game breaking receiver alters the Steelers’ offensive ceiling and sharpens questions about accountability, fairness, and where player protection ends when fans step out of bounds.The NFL announced a two game suspension without pay after determining that Metcalf violated league policy regarding player fan interactions. In its statement, the league said that “players may not enter the stands or otherwise confront fans at any time on game day and … if a player makes unnecessary physical contact with a fan in any way that constitutes unsportsmanlike conduct or presents crowd-control issues and/or risk of injury, he will be held accountable.The altercation occurred during the second quarter of Pittsburgh’s 29-24 win over Detroit. Television cameras captured Metcalf grabbing a fan leaning over the railing behind the Steelers’ bench. The referees did not see the exchange, and no penalty was assessed during the game.Conflicting accounts followed. The fan, Ryan Kennedy, told the Detroit Free Press, “I called him that, and then he grabbed me and ripped my shirt. I’m a little shocked.” Kennedy later denied using any slurs, stating through attorney Murphy Law that he “denies using the ‘N-word,’ the ‘C-word,’ or any racial, misogynistic, or hate-based slur.”Former players Chad Johnson and James Harrison offered a different version after speaking with Metcalf. Harrison said, “I talked to DK personally, and DK said that he actually called his mom a (c-word). And as he asked him what he was saying, he then called him a (n-word).” Johnson echoed the claim on his podcast, saying, “(The fan) called him the n-word and he did call his mom a (c-word).”NFL Network later reported that Metcalf had previously flagged a Lions fan to security during a game in Detroit last season. While that history remains disputed, the league still acted decisively.If the suspension stands, Metcalf will miss games against Cleveland and Baltimore, costing him $555,555 in salary. More than the money, the ruling highlights how quickly emotions can derail a season, even for one of the league’s most dominant stars.Also Read: Will DK Metcalf face NFL punishment after viral video shows Steelers star punching Lions fan?","Pittsburgh Steelers wide receiver DK Metcalf was suspended for two games without pay for punching a Detroit Lions fan.

“It ruins your spirit”: Stefon Diggs' beau Cardi B explains why challenging Mariah Carey’s Christmas legacy isn’t worth it,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/it-ruins-your-spirit-stefon-diggs-beau-cardi-b-explains-why-challenging-mariah-careys-christmas-legacy-isnt-worth-it/articleshow/126122573.cms,"Cardi B once revealed she turned down the chance to record a Christmas song out of respect for Mariah Carey’s holiday legacy. Calling Christmas music “untouchable,” the rapper said she didn’t want to risk releasing a song that failed and spoiled the season’s spirit. Instead, Cardi chooses to celebrate Christmas personally while letting Carey continue to dominate the charts.

Cardi B’s respect for Mariah Carey shows strategic restraint, not hesitation

Cardi B loves Christmas but not enough to challenge its undisputed queen. Known for turning the holidays into a spectacle of towering trees, lavish décor, and family-centered celebrations, the rapper has fully embraced the season in her personal life. Fans have long wondered why that festive energy hasn’t translated into a Cardi B Christmas single.The answer, as she’s explained before, is rooted in respect, self-awareness, and a rare understanding of cultural legacy. For Cardi, Christmas music isn’t just another genre, it’s sacred territory best left untouched.Back in 2019, Cardi B was firmly in her commercial prime, making her decision to turn down a Christmas song opportunity all the more notable. While promoting a holiday campaign, she acknowledged that the idea was on the table, but quickly dismissed it.“I feel like those aren’t things you should touch,” she said at the time. “You should leave it to Mariah Carey and leave it there,” she continued. “You don’t want to mess it up. You don’t want to put a Christmas song out and it don’t do good and it ruins your spirit. Listen, I am not playing with Christmas.”That mindset reveals more than humility, it highlights business instincts many artists lack.Holiday music is unforgiving. Unlike standard releases, Christmas songs live or die by tradition, nostalgia, and repeat listening. Few songs illustrate that better than Mariah Carey’s All I Want for Christmas Is You, which continues to dominate charts more than three decades after its release.In 2025, the song tied the record for the most weeks at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100, logging 19 nonconsecutive weeks at the top. Carey also became the first artist to score No. 1 hits across four decades, a feat that cements her holiday reign as untouchable.Rather than chasing a risky seasonal hit, Cardi has chosen to celebrate Christmas on her own terms, through family, visuals, and viral moments, without diluting her brand or competing with a cultural institution. In an industry obsessed with constant output, sometimes knowing when not to release music is the smartest move of all.Also Read: Stefon Diggs’ beau Cardi B becomes one of the highest-paid OnlyFans creators with a reported $9 million per month","Cardi B turned down the chance to record a Christmas song out of respect for Mariah Carey's holiday legacy.

Taylor Swift honors backup singer’s strength after cancer diagnosis during Eras Tour

The Eras Tour by Taylor Swift has been praised as grand and showcased, but a much more human narrative unraveling behind the scenes is now making the same impact. In a recent episode of the Disney+ original series, Swift and her crew discuss the cancer diagnosis of her backup singer Jeslyn Gorman during the tour and her incredible recovery back on the stage.Jeslyn Gorman, who previously toured with Swift during the Reputation Stadium Tour in 2018, was one of the newest additions to the Eras Tour vocal lineup. ""Most of the people I’m out here on the road with have known me since high school. But also there are people that I just got to know in this phase of my life,"" Swift said in the docu series. ""Jeslyn is one of the most talented, resilient, loving people I’ve ever been around. She was the newest addition to our backups singers.""ID@undefinedCaption not available.ID@undefinedCaption not available.Gorman then recalled first working with Swift on the Reputation Stadium Tour in 2018. ""I had never done a stadium tour before, and so the first show was just like, ‘Whoa, this is a lot of people,’” she said.Swift further added that the Eras Tour marked their second major run of shows together, ""and when Jeslyn got sick, it was the first blow that the tour family experienced emotionally.""It was like, completely unfathomable to us.”For six months, Gorman “had to take off and go through chemo, surgery” and battled “skin issues.” Swift then added, “I cannot believe she was back in a few months. The will to come back and do the hardest show ever, none of us could believe it. I still can’t.”She gushed over her “professional family” sticking together as they “go through phases of life … ups and downs and heartbreaks. There are people I just got to know in this phase of my life. Jeslyn is one of the most talented, resilient people I’ve ever been around.”Elsewhere in the episode, Swift pulled back the curtain on her intense workout routine, shared the reasoning behind adding a second “Reputation” catsuit, and offered more behind-the-scenes insight. The fourth episode leaned heavily into her relationship with Travis Kelce, with Swift describing her now-fiancé as her “right fit.”Four episodes of “End of an Era” are available to stream on Disney+, with the final two premiering December 23.Also Read: “The losses affect Taylor”: Travis Kelce’s season-ending loss forces Taylor Swift into an emotional reality check","Taylor Swift opened up about a painful chapter during the Eras Tour.

“Didn’t want anything over the top”: Insiders reveal why Gisele Bündchen opted for a quiet wedding with Joaquim Valente,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/didnt-want-anything-over-the-top-insiders-reveal-why-gisele-bndchen-opted-for-a-quiet-wedding-with-joaquim-valente/articleshow/126121590.cms,"Gisele Bündchen kept her wedding to Joaquim Valente private because she wanted to escape public attention and celebrate on her own terms, sources say. The model preferred a small, intimate ceremony focused on family and happiness rather than spectacle. Now settled in Miami, Bündchen is said to feel fulfilled, grounded, and genuinely content in this new chapter of her life.

Why Gisele Bündchen chose a deeply private wedding with Joaquim Valente

Tom Brady's ex-wife Gisele Bundchen is no stranger to the public eye, but her most recent big event occurred out of the cameras and the headlines. Earlier this month, she got married this month in Surfside, Florida, to jiu-jitsu instructor Joaquim Valente. Bündchen decided to have a small wedding.According to those around Bündchen, the decision was not one of concealment, but one of ownership. The 45-year-old model is now creating a life centered on sustainability, privacy, and joy of his own, after years of extreme public attention.Gisele Bündchen opted to keep her recent nuptials with Joaquim Valente private. “Gisele is tired of all of the attention on her private life, but [she and Valente] are both so happy being together, and being new parents it was what they wanted to do. They are best friends with a lot in common and are so excited about everything,” the source told PEOPLE.“Gisele just wants to do things her own way,"" the insider added. ""And a small, private non-event was what she wanted. Her life is filled with her kids, her loving family and work, but it is more manageable. She is happy being married again, happy being a mom and happy in her environment. It is an enviable position.”Another source revealed that Bündchen didn’t want anything “over the top” for her second wedding.“Gisele is happy and in love, and getting married was in her plans, the timing just had to be right. She didn’t want anything over the top or made public so they could enjoy the day, each other and the family.”The source also said that she hasn’t been this happy in a very long time. “Everything has fallen into place for her, and she is fulfilled. Those close to her are so happy for her. Getting married was right.”Bündchen and Tom Brady divorced in October 2022 after 13 years of marriage. They agreed to joint custody of their children: Benjamin, 14, and Vivian, 11. Brady, 46, is also dad to son Jack, 16, with his ex-girlfriend, actress Bridget Moynahan.

Joe Alwyn sparks fresh family speculation after rare public outing amid Taylor Swift breakup revelations

Joe Alwyn is once again in the limelight of discussion due to absolutely unrelated reasons to movie releases or Oscar nominations. Recently, the British actor was seen on a family outing in the North of London, the first occasion he has seen the spotlight after Taylor Swift openly discussed her split with him in her recent Disney+ documentary.What would otherwise have appeared to be a typical Sunday walk was quickly discussed on the internet, which underscored the constant interest in the personal life of Alwyn after a long, notoriously low profile relationship with the pop celebrity.The pictures of Alwyn holding a pram with his mother, Elizabeth, and a little kid caused an immediate gossip on social media, with some of the fans wondering whether the actor has secretly had a baby.

Travis Kelce stays focused on Kansas City Chiefs season amid Taylor Swift rumors

Rumors around Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce took over sports and pop culture this week after a surprising on-air comment. Sports analyst Bill Simmons claimed Swift is pregnant while talking about Kelce’s future with the Kansas City Chiefs. The comment came during Simmons’ Sunday night show, where he was reacting to the Chiefs’ tough loss to the Tennessee Titans in Nashville. Simmons made the statement while urging Kelce to protect his health and end his season early. The claim has not been confirmed by Swift, Kelce, or their representatives, and Simmons has not clarified or corrected his words so far.Still, the moment spread fast online. Fans were left wondering if Simmons misspoke, was guessing about the couple’s future, or knew something that has not been shared publicly. As of now, there is no official announcement.Simmons said on his show:“It was officially a ‘feel bad for Kelce.’ Guy’s a Hall of Famer, he’s getting married to Taylor Swift, having a kid with her, probably flies everywhere private, has private security everywhere he goes. And he’s just kind of running around this f***ing Titans game, trying not to get hurt. Fake an injury. Just fake an injury and end the thing.”Swift was not at the game in Nashville. She usually attends Chiefs home games and rarely travels for road matchups.Despite the noise, Travis Kelce has stayed calm and careful with his words. Speaking to Kansas City reporters at a Chiefs press conference on Friday, he avoided talking about retirement or his personal life.Kelce said:“I think I would rather just keep the focus of the media and everything on this team right now and all the conversations I have with the team and everything moving forward will be with them.”He added:“I think it’s a unique time in my life and unfortunately I got three games left and I know when the season ends this year, typically we go into it and we don’t know when it’s gonna end and that’s the beauty of it.”The Chiefs are already out of playoff contention. They play next on Christmas Day at Arrowhead Stadium against the Denver Broncos, followed by a final game on January 4 in Las Vegas against the Las Vegas Raiders.There is also concern around Kelce’s future without his close teammate Patrick Mahomes, who suffered an ACL injury in a recent loss to the Los Angeles Chargers.Off the field, attention remains on Swift and Kelce’s upcoming wedding plans. Reports earlier this month said the couple could marry on June 13, a date linked to Swift’s favorite number. There has also been talk about Swift’s Rhode Island home being prepared for a possible wedding. None of this has been officially confirmed.For now, the only confirmed truth is this: Travis Kelce says his focus is still on his team, while the pregnancy talk remains unproven talk sparked by one analyst’s words.Also Read: ‘She’s Not Going Anywhere Unless…’ Taylor Swift Skips Beau Travis Kelce’s Road Loss, And The Security Talk Isn’t Dying","Sports analyst Bill Simmons claimed Swift is pregnant while talking about Travis Kelce’s future with the Kansas City Chiefs.

Sherrone Moore’s Instagram messages raised concerns years before arrest

“It was not sexual harassment. It was propriety, ‘Are you an idiot?’ kind of stuff.”

“I guess we will have to see! I would say yes but you would also have a driver haha.”

“inappropriate relationship with a staff member.”

Sherrone Moore became the focus of fresh questions this week after a detailed report described a pattern of uncomfortable social media messages sent to women over several years. The report, published by The Athletic on Monday, linked those messages to wider concerns about his judgment while he was leading the Michigan Wolverines football program.The report came after Sherrone Moore was fired for cause by the University of Michigan following an off-field incident involving a female staff member. While the Instagram messages were not described as criminal, they added context to concerns raised inside the program months earlier.According to The Athletic, five women said they had strange or uncomfortable exchanges with Sherrone Moore on Instagram between 2020 and October 2024.The women told the outlet that Moore often started conversations by liking their stories or sending direct messages, even though they had no professional link to Michigan football.Two people briefed on the situation said these interactions were reported to university officials by fall 2024, during Moore’s first season as head coach in Ann Arbor, Michigan.Officials reportedly reviewed the behavior but did not view it as criminal or as involving university employees.One official told The Athletic,Moore, who is married and a father of three, allegedly asked one woman if he could fly her to Michigan.When she asked what that would involve, Moore replied,The social media revelations surfaced after a serious incident earlier this fall.

Cleveland Browns’ quarterback situation becomes clear as NFL insider details Deshaun Watson's status and Shedeur Sanders' role for 2025,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/cleveland-browns-quarterback-situation-becomes-clear-as-nfl-insider-details-deshaun-watsons-status-and-shedeur-sanders-role-for-2025/articleshow/126127987.cms,"Browns settle Deshaun Watson and Shedeur Sanders roles (Image via: Getty Images)

Browns move forward with rookie QBs Shedeur Sanders and Dillon Gabriel for remaining games



The Cleveland Browns’ quarterback situation in 2025 has been anything but simple, with injuries and rookie development shaping the season. After weeks of speculation, it now appears the team will stop at three quarterbacks this year. Veteran Deshaun Watson recently returned to practice following a long Achilles injury but remains on the physically unable to perform (PUP) list. Head coach Kevin Stefanski faces the PUP activation deadline on December 23, yet insiders indicate Watson will not see game action in the final two weeks.Even if Watson is activated, his role would likely be limited to practice rather than actual games. Browns insider Zac Jackson of The Athletic notes that Watson’s return this season was never realistic. This leaves rookie quarterbacks Shedeur Sanders and Dillon Gabriel to handle Weeks 17 and 18.Both Sanders and Gabriel played in Cleveland’s narrow 23-20 loss at home against the Buffalo Bills. Sanders completed 157 yards with one touchdown and two interceptions, briefly leaving the game after injuring the pinky on his throwing hand. He returned after missing just one snap, while Gabriel took that lone play and was sacked for minimal yardage.Even though the QB rotation looks to be set as of the end of 2025, there are some uncertainties as to next season. The Browns have confirmed Watson will return in some capacity in 2026, but his role is uncertain. Financial considerations complicate the picture, as releasing him before June 1 would result in a $131 million dead cap hit. This makes Sanders the likely starter unless the team opts for a major roster change.Sanders has a record of 1-4 as a starter, throwing 55% of his passes successful with six touchdowns, eight interceptions, and 183.8 passing yards per game. However, his willingness to throw downfield and the 123 rushing yards and a touchdown he’s added with his legs show there’s still some encouraging upside in his game. Still, work is needed if Watson decides to come back in 2026. The future of the team’s quarterback situation in Cleveland has been of great interest.Also Read: Shedeur Sanders makes jaw-dropping move backing Deshaun Watson in Cleveland Browns locker room","Browns move forward with rookie QBs Shedeur Sanders and Dillon Gabriel for remaining games.

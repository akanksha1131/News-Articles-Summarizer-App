This year, most scrambled to check the Google Maps to find Curacao when the smallest-ever nation, in terms of population and size, qualified for next year’s mammoth World Cup 2026. With 155,000 inhabitants, the Caribbean island was guided to the top tier by Dick Advocaat, the former Rangers and PSV boss who has also worked with eight national teams including his native Netherlands (1992-94).Sebastian Migne never set foot on Haiti, another Caribbean nation, because international flights do not land there. They played all their World Cup home qualifiers in Curacao, some 500 miles across the sea.These football stories are the brightest beacon of 2025. In contrast, the darkness around Indian football seems to have grown deeper, unfathomable, with no light at the end of the tunnel.The year gone by has seen All India Football Federation officials spend more time making rounds of the courts than the national team spent on the field.It might delight a research scholar to know that AIFF has presented itself to the Supreme Court 16 times and counting.The national team has played only 12 matches. None of it, though, will bring cheer to the fans.Never since Independence has Indian football slipped into such a deep abyss. For the first time since 1996, when the national league was begun by then-AIFF president Priya Ranjan Das Munshi, it has stalled.One can say with a heavy heart that the league is an orphan now.The sponsorship ran out. The new occupants of Football House, who took charge in 2022, were aware of the matter. But the negotiations just refused to yield any money, assurance, or hope.Since 2010, the AIFF received Rs 50 crore every year from Football Sports Development Limited (FSDL), a Reliance Industries subsidiary, as part of an agreement. The 15-year contract ran out on Dec 8.It was obvious to all, except those in Football House, that no one wants to waste money to keep Indian football – once called a sleeping giant by Sepp Blatter just over a decade and a half ago – alive and awake.Till reports last came in, the AIFF plans to start the elite league around Feb 7-8 after presenting a 20-year plan to the ISL clubs. In accordance with the constitution, the league will be owned and operated by the AIFF and will “implement the principles of promotion and relegation.”“I am convinced we can start the league and then work out a long-term solution,” said IFA secy Anirban Dutta, a member of the committee to resolve the ISL crisis.All year, the stakeholders went into hair-splitting debates and nuanced offerings but the outcome, sadly, has been zero. Even a few clubs had temporarily stopped paying salaries to the players. There has been a frustrating sense of ennui.Last heard, there was some warmth shown by the beleaguered clubs towards the AIFF’s proposals. The format for a truncated league is expected to be confirmed in the year’s final week.Add to it the dismal performance of the national team. Hours after India lost to Bangladesh in their last Asian Cup qualification engagement, Haiti’s ticket to the World Cup sent euphoric shock waves around the world. To watch India’s matches this year, under coaches Manolo Marquez and Khalid Jamil, was like visiting the dentist with a severe toothache.The Indian senior men’s team failed to qualify for the 2027 AFC Asian Cup, which means no competitive football until at least Nov 2027. That is nearly three years without meaningful matches. One wonders what will be Khalid Jamil’s work schedule now?One question keeps haunting, though. If Curacao are able to hire the services of a world-renowned coach like Advocaat, why could India, claimed to be the fourth-largest economy in the world, never reach beyond the Manolos and the Stimacs and the Koevermans? One can keep waiting for an answer but there will only be silence from the All India Football Federation.Following some creditable performances against Bahrain (2-0) and Brunei (6-0), U-23 coach Naushad Moosa got stuck in Doha. Not one to be easily perturbed, even by the sudden bombing of the Qatari capital, Moosa showered rousing praise on the boys. But his enthusiasm was laced with bleakness.“What’s next for the boys? They will go back to their clubs and warm the bench. They won’t be getting any minutes,” he had said in Sept. With the U-17s, Bibiano Fernandes also made headlines by helping the boys cross the Asian Cup qualification hurdles.Repeating himself, Moosa confirmed his apprehensions in Dec. “Nothing is happening. The players too are sadly cooling their heels.” And we couldn’t but recall the days not too long ago, when the AIFF had to put a cap of 45 matches on the national team players.One may point out that these are silver linings. If so, then why can’t Manolo or Jamil do without Sunil Chhetri , India’s weather-beaten warhorse who is past 40? The striker had to break his retirement vows and don the India shirt again, confirming that Indian football’s cupboard is starkly bare.The year 2025 will stay in memory as the lowest point in Indian football.LEAGUE UNCERTAINTY: It’s the end of December, half-time in most football seasons, a time when clubs redraw their strategies, depending on the progress they’ve made in the league. This year, nothing. Indian football has never seen anything like this. There’s no word on the top tier ISL or the I-League, because the AIFF has simply failed to find a commercial partner. Everything’s at a standstill: clubs have paused first team operations, players have stopped training and many foreigners plan to move elsewhere once the transfer window opens on Jan 1. One club has told players they will have to “forego salaries” for months and they’d be “happy to resume payments” only from the date of restart.CAMPS WITHOUT PLAYERS: National team camps often kicked off without half the players. Coach Khalid Jamil wanted more time with the boys, but clubs refused to release players outside the FIFA international windows. It was no different for U-23 assignments. The trust deficit between the two parties has grown so much that Mohun Bagan SG, who have the maximum players at national camps, even accused the federation of negligence over the handling of their captain Subhashish Bose.MONUMENTAL FAILURE: In the 15 months between May 2024 and August 2025, the national team had three coaches — Igor Stimac, Manolo Marquez, Khalid Jamil — none of whom could ensure that India makes it to the AFC Asian Cup, the country’s first failure since the tournament was expanded to accommodate 24 teams. In the final round of qualifiers, India were the highest-ranked side but finished at the bottom, unable to register a single win and in five matches, scoring just twice. The defeat to Bangladesh in Dhaka, the first in 22 years, rankled the most.THE BIG EXIT: The City Football Group’s exit from Mumbai City FC was probably the biggest reflection of the mess that is Indian football. CFG, the world’s leading private owner and operator of 13 clubs, including Manchester City, had joined hands with Mumbai City with much fanfare. Their decision to divest its shareholding in the club is a huge blow. The reason: “CFG made this decision following a comprehensive commercial review and in light of the ongoing uncertainty surrounding the future of the Indian Super League (ISL). ”BUT, A SILVER LINING: The women’s team provided joy in an otherwise grim state. The senior team defied the odds to defeat World Cuppers Thailand and qualify for the AFC Asian Cup. The U-17 and U-20 teams also left India with three continental competitions to play for in the opening months of 2026. At club level, East Bengal’s SAFF Club Championship triumph and a first group stage win in the AFC Women’s Champions League brought cheer.UNDER MANOLO MARQUEZUNDER KHALID JAMILIndia won Bronze Medal at CAFA Nations CupTOTAL MATCHES: 11India Won: 3India Lost: 5Drawn: 3Goals Scored: 8Goals Conceded: 12","Indian football has slipped into such a deep abyss.

Ryan Rickelton press conference: 'Been tough last couple of months mentally in India'

Florian Wirtz's first Liverpool goal fired the Reds into the Premier League 's top four despite an unconvincing 2-1 win over Wolves on a day both clubs paid tribute to Diogo Jota . Jota, who was killed in a car accident alongside his brother Andre Silva in July, won four trophies after joining Liverpool from Wolves in 2020.Two of his children led the teams out as mascots, while his wife Rute Cardoso watched on from the sidelines.Both sets of fans sang chants in Jota's name in the 18th and 20th minutes -- the shirt numbers he wore during his spells at Molineux and Anfield respectively.""After the tragedy happened until now, I have seen so many special moments -- where the fans remembered him or our players conducted themselves unbelievably in the circumstances,"" said Liverpool boss Arne Slot.""Not only our fans but the fans of away teams have shown the respect both Diogo and his brother deserved. It was special to see his children being the mascot and how emotional it was before the game and then in the 20th minute.""On the field, both clubs have suffered this season with Wolves staring down the barrel of relegation after taking just two points from their opening 18 league games.Liverpool's form has improved of late and Wirtz is beginning to show flashes of the brilliance that lured the English champions into paying Bayer Leverkusen £100 million ($135 million) for the German international.The 22-year-old registered his first Premier League assist last weekend for a goal that came at some cost to Liverpool as Alexander Isak suffered a broken leg in opening the scoring against Tottenham.Shorn of the most expensive player in English football history for the coming months, there is even more pressure on Wirtz to deliver on his hefty price tag.""He's been very important for us throughout the season. But in football it is about results, you are mainly judged on results or on goals and assists,"" added Slot.""I think today he showed much more than just the goal he scored; he was special for us in many parts of the game.""Wirtz finally opened his account in his 23rd Liverpool appearance by prodding home Hugo Ekitike's pass to double the home side's lead.Just 90 seconds earlier, Liverpool had made the breakthrough when Ryan Gravenberch slammed in Jeremie Frimpong's cross.Yet, even with a 2-0 half-time lead against a side on course to become the worst in Premier League history, Slot could not relax.Santiago Bueno exposed Liverpool's frailty from set-pieces to pull a goal back just six minutes into the second half.Slot's men have made a habit of late collapses at Leeds and Tottenham in recent weeks and needed a perfectly-timed tackle from Conor Bradley to deny Jhon Arias a late equaliser.","Liverpool beat Wolves 2-1 in Premier League.

Navjot Singh Sidhu insta post

Gautam Gambhir's year as India coach ends like it started - on a chaotic note

Former India cricketer Navjot Singh Sidhu has sparked fresh debate around Virat Kohli ’s Test retirement with an emotional Instagram post that has resonated widely among fans. Posting on Saturday, Sidhu wrote, “If God granted me a wish I’d say bring Kohli out of his retirement & make him play Test Cricket …. Nothing would give more joy and ecstasy to a country of 1.5 billion! His fitness is that of a twenty year old — he himself 24 carat gold.”Virat Kohli announced his retirement from Test cricket earlier this year, officially stepping away from the format on 12 May 2025. He brought down the curtain on a distinguished red-ball career after 123 Tests, scoring 9,230 runs at an average of 46.85, with 30 centuries and 31 half-centuries to his name.Kohli had already retired from T20 internationals last year, bowing out after India’s triumphant T20 World Cup campaign in Barbados. Following his Test retirement, the former India captain is now a single-format player, focusing solely on One Day Internationals.Despite stepping away from two formats, Kohli’s form in ODIs has remained outstanding. After India’s Champions Trophy triumph earlier in March, the team toured Australia for a bilateral series. The tour began on a rare low for Kohli, who registered back-to-back ducks in the first two ODIs — the first time that had happened in his international career.However, the turnaround was emphatic. In the Sydney ODI, Kohli rediscovered his rhythm, scoring an unbeaten 74 as India chased down 237 with ease. Rohit Sharma led the way with a commanding 121 not out off 125 balls, striking 13 fours and three sixes, as the pair finished the job with more than 11 overs to spare — in what could potentially be their final international appearances in Australia.Kohli carried that momentum into the South Africa tour, where he produced back-to-back centuries in the first two ODIs. He then capped the series with an unbeaten 65 in the third match, guiding India to a successful chase of 271 and sealing a 2–1 series win.The numbers underline the resurgence. The 37-year-old finished the year with 651 ODI runs from 13 innings, averaging an exceptional 65.10 — a testament to the enduring quality that prompted Sidhu’s heartfelt appeal for a Test comeback.","Navjot Singh Sidhu appeals for Virat Kohli to return to Test cricket.

Why Rohit Sharma got really emotional at a promotional event

JAIPUR: Call it the sport’s multiplier effect. Following Rohit Sharma ’s entertaining batting display against Sikkim on Wednesday, the Rajasthan Cricket Association (RCA) officials are bracing themselves for another surge, this time greater, of fans when the star studded Mumbai play their second Vijay Hazare Trophy match at the Sawai Mansingh Stadium here on Friday.It will be Blockbuster Friday should Rohit continue his magical batting show against Uttarakhand.On Wednesday, around 20,000 spectators showed up and enjoyed the match as Rohit unleashed his wide range of strokes to hammer a 94-ball 155 runs as Mumbai cruised to an eight-wicket win over the minnows.With Christmas holidays on, the organisers are expecting more spectators Friday.“We are opening two more stands in the north block as we are expecting more cricket lovers on Friday. There were at least two-three thousand fans waiting outside on Wednesday as the stands we opened were absolutely packed. We will make all possible efforts so that more people can watch the Mumbai match tomorrow. It will be free entry for all the spectators,” RCA ad-hoc committee convener DD Kumawat told TOI on Thursday.Uttarakhand, who lost to Himachal Pradesh in their opening match on Wednesday, also had a practice session on Thursday.The Mumbai team, meanwhile, had an optional practice session on Thursday and only eight players turned up at the RCA Academy ground in the afternoon session.Most of the senior players including Rohit and captain Shardul Thakur opted to rest.The Khan brothers — Sarfaraz and Musheer — had a long batting session in the nets. Upcoming batter Suryansh Shedge and experienced left-arm spinner Shams Mulani sweated it out in the nets. Those players who did not get a chance to play against Sikkim showed up at the optional practice along with the support staff. After nets, all of them went through fielding drills and catching sessions.Some of the die-hard fans also turned up at the RCA Academy ground hoping to get a glimpse of Rohit but they were disappointed as the star did not come to the venue. “We are obviously disappointed not to see him today at the practice but we will be surely coming to see the match tomorrow and hoping to get full entertainment from Rohit’s batting display,” said some of the fans on Thursday.","Mumbai play second Vijay Hazare Trophy match at Sawai Mansingh Stadium on Friday.

Gautam Gambhir's year as India coach ends like it started - on a chaotic note

As the year drew to a close, Indian cricket found itself sharing space with an unfamiliar kind of headline. Vaibhav Sooryavanshi, still three months short of his 15th birthday, was named a recipient of the Prime Minister’s National Award for Children, the Pradhan Mantri Rashtriya Bal Puraskar. It is the country’s highest civilian honour for achievers between the ages of five and 18. No cricketer had ever received it before. That alone set him apart. The fact that he now sits alongside names like chess stars R Praggnanandhaa and R Vaishali only underlined how extraordinary his rise has been.The award felt like a natural conclusion to a year in which Sooryavanshi did far more than chase records. He rewrote expectations of age, time and readiness. In 2025, no Indian cricketer was searched more on Google. Not Virat Kohli. Not Rohit Sharma. Instead, it was a schoolboy left-hander from Motihari, Bihar, whose name kept reappearing on screens across the country. What began as curiosity soon turned into understanding. This was not noise built on novelty. It was attention driven by performance.The defining moment arrived quietly, without television cameras or primetime build-up.In a Vijay Hazare Trophy match against Arunachal Pradesh, Sooryavanshi produced an innings that seemed to belong to another era. He smashed 190 off just 84 balls, striking at 226.19, with 16 fours and 15 sixes. That knock made him the youngest player in the history of List A cricket to score a century, breaking a 39-year-old world record previously held by Pakistan’s Zahoor Elahi.Yet this was no sudden eruption. Months earlier, on April 28 in Jaipur, Sooryavanshi had announced himself on the IPL stage with startling clarity. At 14 years and 32 days, he scored a breathtaking 101 off 38 balls against Gujarat Titans. It was fearless, explosive and unapologetic. Seven fours, eleven sixes, and a tally of maximums that equalled Murali Vijay’s IPL record. At 14, he also became the youngest player ever to score a T20 century.Even his final appearance of the IPL season felt scripted. Against Chennai Super Kings, he struck 57 off 33 balls to seal a Rajasthan victory. Broadcasters framed it as “Gen Bold vs Gen Gold”. By then, the identity of the poster boy was already clear.Records trailed him everywhere. He made his Ranji Trophy debut at 12 years and 284 days, becoming India’s youngest first-class cricketer. At just 13, he earned an IPL contract worth Rs 1.1 crore, the youngest player ever to be bought at an auction.His impact stretched beyond domestic cricket. Against Australia Under-19, he blasted 104 off 58 balls, the fastest Under-19 century by an Indian and the second-fastest worldwide. Across consecutive Under-19 Asia Cups, he remained central to India’s batting narrative. In 2025, he went even further, hammering an audacious 144 off 42 balls against UAE, an innings that included a 32-ball hundred.Indian cricket has known prodigies before. Very few, however, have shaped an entire year around themselves before finishing school. Vaibhav Sooryavanshi did exactly that.","Vaibhav Sooryavanshi was named a recipient of the Prime Minister’s National Award for Children, the Pradhan Mantri Rashtriya Bal Puraskar.

Gautam Gambhir's year as India coach ends like it started - on a chaotic note

NEW DELHI: Former India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni, who largely keeps a low profile away from the cricket field, made a rare public appearance when he attended Bollywood superstar Salman Khan’s 60th birthday celebrations in Panvel, Maharashtra. Khan marked the milestone with a midnight party at his farmhouse, which was attended by close family members, friends and colleagues from the film industry. Dhoni’s presence at the event quickly became a talking point, underlining his enduring popularity even years after retiring from international cricket.As Dhoni left the venue and settled into his car, fans gathered outside broke into loud chants of “Mahi bhai! Mahi bhai!”, a reminder that his aura remains untouched by time or absence from the international stage.While Dhoni now limits his cricketing appearances to the Indian Premier League, his fan following continues to be unmatched, cutting across generations and sporting loyalties.Dhoni will once again be seen in Chennai Super Kings colours in the IPL 2026 season, having been retained by the franchise he has led with remarkable success over the years. Under his captaincy, CSK have built a reputation for stability, backing experience while seamlessly integrating young talent.Notably, Vijay played eight IPL seasons for CSK, all under Dhoni’s leadership, a testament to the former skipper’s ability to foster long-term player development.The influence of Dhoni is already evident on CSK’s latest recruits. Kartik Sharma, one of the franchise’s newest entrants, admitted he was overwhelmed by the intense bidding war that unfolded for him at the recently concluded IPL auction and said he was “extremely excited” at the prospect of sharing a dressing room with the veteran.Watch the video here Kartik, along with Prashant Veer, became the joint-highest-priced uncapped players in IPL history after CSK paid a staggering Rs 14.20 crore each for the duo, who had entered the auction with a base price of Rs 30 lakh. The investment highlighted CSK’s clear intent to nurture emerging Indian talent alongside established names.Speaking to JioStar, Kartik described the emotional rollercoaster of auction night. “First of all, a special thank you to all my family members and friends. Without their support, I don’t think I would have reached this stage. My entire family is very happy, everyone is celebrating and dancing,” he said. Kartik added that playing with Dhoni was a dream come true, revealing that he broke down in tears as the bids kept climbing.Recognised for his aggressive middle-order batting and reliable wicketkeeping, Kartik has scored 334 runs in 12 T20 matches at a strike rate of 164, hitting 28 sixes and featuring among the top six-hitters in the Ranji Trophy. He has also impressed in the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy and earned praise after training with CSK last season, particularly for his ability to handle both spin and pace — qualities that could flourish under Dhoni’s guidance.","MS Dhoni made a rare public appearance when he attended Bollywood superstar Salman Khan’s 60th birthday celebrations in Panvel, Maharashtra.

On This Day: Ajinkya Rahane’s century that changed Indian cricket,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/on-this-day-ajinkya-rahanes-century-that-changed-indian-cricket/articleshow/126192786.cms,"Ajinkya Rahane and Ravindra Jadeja (AP/PTI)

Gautam Gambhir's year as India coach ends like it started - on a chaotic note

On this day in 2020, December 27, Ajinkya Rahane played an innings that quietly altered the course of Indian Test cricket. It did not come wrapped in noise or bravado. It arrived in the aftermath of trauma. India had been bundled out for their lowest-ever total in the previous match - a humiliating 36 all out in Adelaide. Captain Virat Kohli had flown home on paternity leave. Mohammed Shami was ruled out of the tour. Umesh Yadav was injured. Confidence was fractured, belief questioned, and Australia sensed blood. What followed at the Melbourne Cricket Ground was not merely a response but a reclaiming of dignity, led by a stand-in captain who spoke with his bat.India began the second Test carrying the weight of collapse and expectation. When Day 2 started, they were 36 for 1 after Australia had been bowled out for 195, the echoes of Adelaide still loud. The morning was overcast, the ball moved, and Australia’s fast bowlers bowled disciplined lines.Australia struck early. Shubman Gill and Cheteshwar Pujara fell in quick succession, briefly threatening another collapse.Yet Rahane stood firm. From the very first delivery he faced, there was clarity in his intent. He drove straight when the ball was full, pulled with control when it was short, and trusted his defence when Australia searched for errors. A dropped catch on 78 off the second new ball proved decisive. Rahane marched on, making Australia pay for every missed chance.He stitched the innings together patiently. Partnerships with Hanuma Vihari, Rishabh Pant, and eventually Ravindra Jadeja rebuilt India’s hold on the match. Vihari and Pant showed promise before falling, but Jadeja became the perfect partner. Jadeja left well, chose his scoring areas carefully, and allowed Rahane to dictate the tempo. Their century stand for the sixth wicket broke Australia’s resistance. The bowlers tired, the new ball lost its threat, and frustration crept in. Even when Starc struck Rahane on the handle late in the day, fortune stayed with him as another chance was spilled. By stumps, India had surged to 277 for 5 and momentum had firmly shifted. Rahane’s century was not just technically sound; it was emotionally stabilising. It gave India belief when very little existed.Rahane’s stay ended on 112 off 223 balls the following morning, in unfortunate fashion — run out after a mix-up following Jadeja’s call. There was no visible frustration or anger. Instead, Rahane walked back and gently patted Jadeja on the shoulder, a quiet acknowledgement that such moments are part of the game. Only a week earlier in Adelaide, Rahane himself had been involved in Virat Kohli’s unfortunate run-out, a moment that triggered India’s dramatic collapse in the first innings. Perspective came easily to him. India eventually added a few more runs to be bowled out for 326, but by then the damage to Australia had already been done.Australia’s second innings only deepened the shift. India strangled their scoring, conceding almost nothing. Australia were bowled out for 200 in 103.1 overs, their slowest home Test innings in decades. They did not manage a single half-century. R Ashwin closed it out, Jasprit Bumrah provided the hostility, and Mohammed Siraj continued his remarkable rise. India were left chasing just 70.There were flickers of tension. Mayank Agarwal fell early. Pujara followed. Memories of 36 briefly hovered. But this was not the India from Adelaide. Shubman Gill batted with freedom, and fittingly, it was Rahane who struck the winning runs. India went from humiliation to dominance in the space of a week.That hundred at Melbourne did more than win a Test. It reset the tour. It restored belief. It laid the foundation for what would become one of India’s greatest Test series victories. Quietly, without theatre, Ajinkya Rahane played one of the most important innings in Indian cricket history.Rahane will forever remain an enigma in Indian cricket. Over the years, he played several outstanding overseas innings, often in some of the most difficult conditions imaginable. He remains one of the rare Indian batters whose Test average away from home is better than his record in India, a statistic that speaks volumes about his technique and temperament. Remarkably, India have never lost a Test match when Rahane scored a century, and under his captaincy, the team remains unbeaten in Test cricket.At the same time, his overall numbers never quite reflected the full extent of his ability. An average of 38.46 does not truly capture the quality of a batter who delivered when conditions were hostile and margins were fine. Rahane’s last few home series were particularly challenging, played on surfaces where batting was extremely difficult and excessive turn made run-scoring a constant struggle. These conditions did not affect him alone. The averages of Cheteshwar Pujara, Rahane, and Virat Kohli all took a hit during this phase, largely because India played on wickets where survival itself was an achievement.Rahane played his final Test in 2023 against the West Indies. He had earned a recall for the World Test Championship final earlier that year and responded by finishing as India’s highest run-scorer in the match, with scores of 89 and 46 in the two innings. That performance briefly suggested a late-career revival.However, the subsequent tour of the West Indies proved disappointing. India played two Tests, but the runs did not come. Soon after, he was dropped from the Test side. Since then, Rahane has remained out of the national team, and it appears highly unlikely that he will represent India in Test cricket again.His career, much like his personality, defied easy definition.

Former England cricketer Michael Vaughan has said that Test cricket fans should not be celebrating after the fourth Ashes Test between Australia and England at the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG) ended in two days.England, led by Ben Stokes, beat Australia by four wickets in the fourth Test on Saturday. It was England’s first win of the tour. The five-match series now stands at 3-1, with Australia having already retained the Ashes by winning the first three Tests.Vaughan shared his view after the match. While acknowledging England’s result, he said the nature of the contest was not something Test cricket supporters should welcome.“A win is a win, and England should celebrate ... but NO Test cricket fans should be celebrating what we have seen for 2 days,” Vaughan wrote on X.In the match, England won the toss and chose to bowl. Josh Tongue picked up 5 for 45, becoming the first England bowler to take a five-wicket haul in a Boxing Day Test at the MCG. Australia were bowled out for 152 in 45.2 overs. Michael Neser scored 35 off 49 balls with seven fours, while Usman Khawaja made 29 off 52 balls with two fours.England were then dismissed for 110 in 29.5 overs.

Zak Crawley scored 37 off 48 balls with three fours and a six, while Ben Duckett made 34 off 26 balls with four boundaries and a six. Crawley also added 47 runs for the third wicket with Jacob Bethell, who scored 40 off 46 balls with five fours.Australia reduced England from 112 for 2 to 165 for 6, but Harry Brook, unbeaten on 18, and Jamie Smith, unbeaten on 3, took England to the target and sealed the win.","England beat Australia by four wickets in the fourth Test on Saturday.

From MCG to T20 World Cup snub: How Indian cricket let Shubman Gill down

Former India batter Robin Uthappa has said that Sanju Samson should open the batting for India in the T20 World Cup 2026, insisting that he must be part of the playing XI at the top of the order.""Sanju Samson should be a starter in the T20 World Cup eleven, no matter what. And I will tell you why. So Sanju Samson is amongst the hundred makers post T20 World Cup 2024. In South Africa, he got back-to-back hundreds and then Bangladesh. (He) Motivated young stars who also put their hands up – if Sanju can score one hundred, I could score as well,"" Uthappa said.The former India wicketkeeper-batter questioned the decision to move away from Samson’s opening partnership with Abhishek Sharma. ""For me, secondly, what wrong did the opening partnership of Sanju Samson and Abhishek Sharma do for them to get broken? It was a working partnership. Because of his versatile nature as a batsman, Sanju can bring stability to the playing combination along with his brilliance in leading a team, so he knows how to react under tough circumstances,"" he added in a video posted on his Instagram profile.Uthappa said Samson also brings balance to the side and cited his performances in pressure situations.""The third reason that he brings a lot of balance into the side. We saw him absorb pressure in the Asia cup in the finals along with Tilak Verma and build that important partnership. But I still think if you're playing Sanju Samson, he has to bat either 1, 2 or 3, not below that,” he said.Samson has been named in India’s squad for the T20 World Cup next year. Ishan Kishan has been picked as the second wicketkeeper-batter in the squad, with Samson set to open the innings alongside Abhishek Sharma.The squad was announced by BCCI secretary Devajit Saikia at the board’s headquarters last Saturday in the presence of captain Suryakumar Yadav and chief selector Ajit Agarkar.Shubman Gill was left out of the squad amid concerns over fitness and form. Gill missed the fifth and final T20I against South Africa due to a foot injury sustained before the fourth T20I, which was abandoned due to fog. Since returning to the T20 side during the Asia Cup as vice-captain, Gill scored 291 runs in 15 matches and innings at an average of 24.25 and a strike rate of over 137, with no fifties and a highest score of 47.Sanju Samson and Abhishek Sharma have now been most likely confirmed as India’s opening pair, while Rinku Singh has also returned to the national side.",Former India batter Robin Uthappa says Sanju Samson should open the batting for India in the T20 World Cup 2026.

Harbhajan Singh lashes out at Virat Kohli, Rohit Sharma critics

How it unfolded

Inglorious end

Cricket matches usually end because one team scores more runs than the other. On December 27, 2009, in Delhi, the pitch ended the contest instead.The fifth and final ODI of the series between India and Sri Lanka at the Ferozeshah Kotla was abandoned after just 23.3 overs because the surface was deemed unsafe. India had already won the five-match series, but this game never reached a sporting conclusion. Instead, it became a reminder that a cricket pitch can take control of a match when it behaves beyond what players can reasonably expect.The Ferozeshah Kotla became the centre of attention for the wrong reasons after the match was abandoned following concerns over safety of payers. The decision brought an uncomfortable end to the series and even raised questions about the venue’s readiness to host international cricket.India had already sealed the five-match ODI series before the teams arrived in Delhi. However, only 23.3 overs were possible before officials decided that the surface offered ""extremely variable bounce and was too dangerous for further play"". From similar areas of the pitch, the bounce ranged from shin height to shoulder height.Batters could not trust length, pace, or bounce; but could only react and hope.Sri Lanka were asked to bat first. Within a few overs, it was obvious that this was not a normal contest between bat and ball.Balls climbed sharply. Others stayed low. Some seamed off the grass, others died off bare patches. The danger was not theoretical. Batters were being hit.On a surface where deliveries of similar length behaved very differently within an over, Sri Lanka were fortunate to escape with only two blows that required medical attention. The uneven bounce made batting difficult and unpredictable throughout the short duration of play.Former India captain Sunil Gavaskar, who was on pitch-report duty, expressed his displeasure with what he saw. He described the irregular grass cover on the wicket as a ""hair transplant"" with bald patches. He explained that balls hitting grassy areas seamed and bounced, while those landing on bare patches stayed low. What added to the problem was that the areas producing such contrasting behaviour were close to each other. Moisture in the pitch added to the difficulty.Despite lasting only 23.3 overs, the match saw a lot of action. There was a wicket off the first ball, a dropped catch off the first ball of the second over, several blows to the body, thick edges flying past third man, and wickets for Zaheer Khan, debutant Sudeep Tyagi and Harbhajan Singh. MS Dhoni, returning after a two-match ban, impressed behind the stumps, handling both low shooters and rising deliveries without conceding a single bye.The match was abandoned after 23.3 overs, triggering unruly scenes in the packed stands. Angry spectators threw water bottles and chair covers and damaged parts of the stadium, bringing a chaotic end to a series India won 3-1.The relaid Kotla pitch proved difficult for the Sri Lankan batters, who were asked to bat first. Deliveries rose sharply, forcing players into awkward defensive shots. Sri Lanka were in the 24th over when Thilina Kandamby approached the on-field umpires to express concerns.This led to a meeting involving match referee Alan Hurst, India captain MS Dhoni, Sri Lanka captain Kumar Sangakkara, coaches Gary Kirsten and Trevor Bayliss, and curator Vijay Bahadur Mishra. Officials from the Delhi and District Cricket Association (DDCA), including vice-president and former Test cricketer Chetan Chauhan, offered an alternative pitch. However, the match could not be resumed.India entered the final match hoping to finish the series with a win, but the conditions made that impossible. Sri Lankan opener Tillakaratne Dilshan was struck on the forearm by an Ashish Nehra delivery and needed on-field treatment after falling to the ground in pain. Sanath Jayasuriya, who batted the longest, was hit several times on the upper arm and wrist during his stay. Despite visible discomfort among batters, play continued until the 24th over.The situation escalated after a delivery from Sudeep Tyagi rose sharply and Kandamby again complained to umpires Marais Erasmus and Shavir Tarapore. The match was eventually abandoned, though the official announcement came more than an hour later. By then, both teams and officials had already left the ground.Earlier in the day, conditions had seemed favourable for hosts. Dhoni, back after serving a ban, won the toss and chose to bowl. India’s bowlers reduced Sri Lanka to 63 for several wickets inside 18 overs.Zaheer Khan struck with the first ball of the match, beating Upul Tharanga’s defence. Ashish Nehra nearly dismissed Dilshan with his first delivery, but Suresh Raina dropped a catch at cover. Dilshan later took a blow to the forearm from another Nehra delivery before Zaheer ended his innings.Sri Lanka captain Kumar Sangakkara was dismissed for one run, becoming Sudeep Tyagi’s first ODI wicket. Sanath Jayasuriya struggled through his innings before Harbhajan Singh trapped him lbw with a top-spinner. Thilan Samaraweera was run out following a mix-up with Kandamby.The match continued for another 5.3 overs before it was finally called off, marking one of the most uncomfortable days in Delhi’s cricketing history and a reminder of how unsafe pitches can bring international matches to a halt.Feroz Shah Kotla, now known as the Arun Jaitley Stadium, was barred from staging international matches for one year, a decision that proved lenient as a two-year ban from the ICC would have cost Delhi its 2011 World Cup fixtures.",The fifth and final ODI of the series between India and Sri Lanka at the Ferozeshah Kotla was abandoned after just 23.3 overs.

WTC Points Table

England produced a stunning Boxing Day result at the Melbourne Cricket Ground on Saturday, pulling off a memorable four-wicket win over Australia that carried significance well beyond the Ashes scoreline. Although Australia had already sealed the urn with a commanding 3-0 lead in the series, the victory marked a rare and much-needed breakthrough for the visitors, ending a 19-Test winless run in Australia.The result also sent ripples through the ICC World Test Championship 2025–2027 standings. Australia had entered the match with a flawless record and a perfect 100 per cent points percentage. The defeat brought that run to an end, handing them their first loss of the current cycle and opening up the race for the rest of the field.Australia remain firmly at the top of the table despite the setback, but their points percentage has dropped from 100 to 85.71. While they are still well placed to qualify for the WTC final, the cushion they enjoyed over New Zealand has been reduced, making the contest at the top slightly tighter.For England, the win provided a valuable boost in an otherwise challenging campaign. Ben Stokes ’ side have now collected 12 points in the cycle, lifting their points percentage to 35.18.However, they continue to sit seventh in the standings, with significant ground to make up on India and the teams placed above them.New Zealand and South Africa stand to gain the most from Australia finally dropping points. With the leaders no longer perfect, the battle for top spot, and the confidence that comes with it, is very much alive.India currently occupy sixth place with a points percentage of 48.15. With Australia and New Zealand maintaining strong positions, India will need an almost flawless run in their upcoming fixtures to push into the top two. England, while still behind India, will be aiming to close that gap after adding another win to their tally.The focus now shifts to Sydney, where the final Test of the Ashes series begins at the SCG on January 4. Australia will be eager to reassert their authority, while England will hope the momentum from Melbourne helps them climb further up the World Test Championship table.","England beat Australia by four wickets at the Melbourne Cricket Ground.

Thiruvananthapuram:

Virat Kohli's childhood coach makes a big statement on 2027 ODI World Cup

India’s women's team will seek to continue their dominance and secure a fourth straight victory against Sri Lanka in the fourth T20I in Thiruvananthapuram on Sunday.At the heart of India’s command stands Renuka Singh , the indefatigable pacer from Himachal who seems to find something extra every time she turns up in Kerala.Kerala, it appears, has a way of rewarding Renuka ’s faith. Each visit to Thiruvananthapuram brings with it an extra spring in her stride and a sharper nip through the air. From her U-19 days to the senior international stage, the venue has steadily become her personal hunting ground.“Kerala is my lucky place,” Renuka said after India’s dominant win over Sri Lanka on Friday. “I played U-19 cricket here as well. Whenever I come here, I take four wickets. I’m always excited to come to Kerala and Thiruvananthapuram is my lucky ground.”In the third T20I, Renuka ripped through Sri Lanka’s middle order with figures of 4/21, a spell that earned her the player-of-the-match award and left the visitors struggling for answers.That medal around her neck tells a deeper story, one built on persistence, preparation and an unwavering belief in process. “I never get five wickets, it’s always four,” she laughs disarmingly, even as she continues to be India’s most dependable pace option in the shortest format.Preparations for Renuka follow a familiar and disciplined path. Before every major assignment, she heads to the National Cricket Academy.“I go to the NCA to prepare for any tournament because it works for me,” she says. “I can do some extra work on my bowling and fitness, and that helps me execute better.”Over the last year, the 29-year-old’s evolution has been unmistakable. No longer just a new-ball bowler relying on swing and seam, Renuka has broadened her repertoire.Slower balls, changes of pace, and subtle variations in length and release are now central to her craft. The timing is deliberate. With a World Cup on the horizon, she knew there was no room for doubt.“For the last six months to a year, I’ve been working on my variations because I knew the World Cup was coming up,” she explained. “There shouldn’t be a doubt in my head. I want to be mentally prepared.”That mental clarity shows most when things don’t go to plan. Even if the first over goes for runs, as it did in the third T20I, Renuka doesn’t retreat.She recalibrates, reads the pitch and commits to the delivery she believes will fetch a wicket. Leadership support from skipper Harmanpreet Kaur helps, but so do the words of a mentor she deeply respects.Jhulan Goswami ’s advice — that five-wicket hauls demand extra effort — still echoes. Renuka has just one T20I five-for so far, a 5/15 against England at the 2023 World Cup, and she knows there is more to chase.Former India player and women’s team coach WV Raman sees her value clearly. Renuka, he says, is a “vital cog” in India’s bowling unit: crafty, intelligent and armed with truckloads of variations.“In helpful conditions, she can be a handful. England, host of next year’s T20 World Cup, with its seam-friendly pitches and swinging skies, could well be her stage,” Raman argued.India, buoyed by the recent ODI World Cup success, is shaping its core for the future. In that group, Renuka remains indispensable. In Thiruvananthapuram, and perhaps soon in England, she isn’t just bowling spells, but carving out her signature, one hard-earned wicket at a time.","India's women's team will seek to continue their dominance against Sri Lanka in the fourth T20I in Thiruvananthapuram on Sunday.

Australian captain Steve Smith said excess grass on the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG) pitch made batting difficult during the fourth Ashes Test, which ended inside two days as England won by four wickets on Saturday.A total of 36 wickets fell across six sessions, with 20 wickets on the opening day and 16 on the second. England’s win ended their long wait for a Test victory in Australia.Smith said the 10mm grass left on the surface played a key role in how the pitch behaved.""It probably started quite slow and it's hard to explain. Not tennis bally normally, that's from like the moisture of the wicket,"" Smith said during the post-match press conference.He added that the thickness of the grass affected how the ball behaved after pitching.""I think because of the thickness of the grass. The ball was just sitting in the grass, if that makes sense to you. Like I felt in the first innings, a couple almost like chipped one to mid on playing a defensive shot that just sort of sat in the grass and it was tricky to drive the ball because of how much it was. The seam was just catching the grass and it was stopping,"" he said.Smith said the surface offered too much seam movement, making it hard for batters to settle.""It was tricky. No one could really get in.

Rayan Cherki steals the show as Manchester City edge Nottingham Forest to go top of the Premier League,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/top-stories/rayan-cherki-steals-the-show-as-manchester-city-edge-nottingham-forest-to-go-top-of-the-premier-league/articleshow/126206283.cms,"Manchester City's Rayan Cherki celebrates with Erling Haaland (Barrington Coombs/PA via AP)

Rayan Cherki delivered another decisive statement of his growing influence at Manchester City as his late strike secured a 2-1 Premier League win over Nottingham Forest and lifted Pep Guardiola’s side to the top of the table on Saturday.The France international was at the heart of everything City did well at the City Ground. After setting up Tijjani Reijnders for the opening goal early in the second half, Cherki returned in the closing stages to fire home the winner, capping a standout display that underlined his importance to City’s title push.City had to weather sustained pressure from Forest, who matched Guardiola’s men for large spells and were level soon after falling behind. Omari Hutchinson, scoring his first goal for the club, punished a rare City mistake to bring the home side back into the contest and briefly threaten another memorable result against the champions.Guardiola’s team eventually found a way through, extending their winning run to eight matches in all competitions and six straight league victories. The result moved City one point clear of Arsenal, although the Gunners could reclaim top spot later in the day with a home win over Brighton.Before kick-off, Forest paid tribute to club legend John Robertson, who passed away on Christmas Day at the age of 72. The former Scotland winger was a central figure in Forest’s back-to-back European Cup triumphs in 1979 and 1980, and his flair and end product were fondly remembered by the City Ground crowd.Cherki, who joined City from Lyon in the summer, appears to share that same blend of creativity and cutting edge. At just 22, he has quickly become a key figure in Guardiola’s side and, should City edge Arsenal to the title, his contribution is likely to be pivotal.Guardiola had set a stern tone over the festive period, warning his players against excess and making it clear that fitness standards would not be compromised. He even cancelled a planned rest day after last weekend’s win over West Ham. When asked about his squad’s condition, Guardiola joked that he was the only one who had put on weight.Despite that discipline, City looked flat before the break and Forest had the better chances. Morgan Gibbs-White went close after meeting a Callum Hudson-Odoi cross, while City struggled to impose themselves. Erling Haaland, who has 19 league goals by Christmas, the joint-most at this stage in Premier League history, was largely kept quiet.The visitors finally found their rhythm just after the interval. Cherki drifted inside and slipped a clever pass to Reijnders, who finished calmly from 12 yards for City’s first shot on target. Cherki then tested goalkeeper John Victor with a fierce effort moments later.Forest responded swiftly. Reijnders lost possession near his own area, allowing Gibbs-White to release Igor Jesus, whose cross was drilled home by Hutchinson from close range. With City wobbling, Neco Williams forced Gianluigi Donnarumma into a save before Nicolo Savona blazed over from the rebound.The decisive moment arrived in the 83rd minute. A loose ball fell to Cherki just inside the box and the Frenchman lashed an unstoppable finish past Victor. He celebrated by mimicking Haaland’s trademark calm pose in front of the travelling supporters.It was a fitting end to a performance that highlighted why Cherki is fast becoming one of Guardiola’s most trusted match-winners as City continue their relentless pursuit of another Premier League crown.",Manchester City beat Nottingham Forest 2-1 at the City Ground.

The All India Football Federation (AIFF) on Friday proposed a new structure for the Indian Super League (ISL), under which the league would be owned and operated by the national body in accordance with its new constitution for the next 20 seasons.According to the new proposal the AIFF formulated after a meeting with the ISL clubs, the league will implement a promotion and relegation system from the upcoming season. Each season will be calculated from June 1 to May 31 of the next year.""We have sent the proposal to the clubs, we have to wait for their response in the next couple of days before finalising our plan,"" an AIFF source told PTI.""Let the clubs respond, we will try to find a solution after hearing them.""It is expected that the AIFF and the clubs will have two more rounds of meetings -- one on Sunday and the other on Monday.If all goes well, the ISL season may start in the first week of February, according to the source.According to the proposal, the ISL will have a predetermined 'Central Operational Budget' for every year that would come from yearly contributions from all 'revenue share holders' proportionate to their revenue share in the league.""This would be known as the 'League Membership Contribution'. Any operational expenses required for the league to be conducted and for clubs to comply with their applicable licensing criteria with the addition of prize money distribution would be capped and borne out of this budget,"" the proposal said.""Governance would be overseen by a Board that would be empowered by the AIFF general body with certain operational autonomy over commercial matters of the League. The jurisdiction of the board would be limited to the utilisation of unrestricted funds within the yearly operational budget earmarked for the same.""Each club, under the proposal, will pay the AIFF a 'standard participating fee' of Rs 1 crore a year at the beginning of the season. This would, however, be independent of any calculations of the 'Central Operating Expenditure'.""This amount would be fully reimbursable from the central revenue prior to distribution of 'Net Revenue'. The total participation fee for all clubs would be put at 20% of the 'central operational budget' of the League. In case the Board decides to raise the 'central operational budget' by 10% in the future, the 'standard participation fee' would proportionately increase.""Any profit, or savings from the operational budget, will be distributed equally amongst all revenue shareholders in proportion to the respective revenue shares.On December 20, a proposal from 10 ISL clubs for ""perpetual"" operational and commercial ownership of the country's top-tier competition failed to get the approval of the AIFF's General Body, which formed a committee to look into the matter.The AIFF panel was tasked with holding discussions with representatives of five clubs - Chennaiyin FC, Mumbai City FC, Delhi Sporting Club, NorthEast United FC and Mohun Bagan Super Giant from December 22 to 29.Under the AIFF's proposal, the total outlay of the first season of the ISL will be Rs 70 crore with the AIFF's revenue share pegged at 10 per cent (that is Rs 7 crore) in the first season, while 50 per cent (Rs 35 crore) will come from the clubs -- 14 as of now unless there is any pull out.But interestingly, a revenue share of 30 per cent has been reserved for a potential commercial partner. The AIFF is yet to get a commercial partner as it did not receive any bid after a tender was floated on the supervision of a Supreme Court-appointed committee under a retired SC judge.Though the AIFF has included a 30 per cent revenue share for a potential commercial partner in the proposal, it is learnt that since the number of matches this season could be less than earlier years, the ISL can be run with a 'central operating budget' of less than the proposed Rs 70 crore.",The All India Football Federation (AIFF) has proposed a new structure for the Indian Super League (ISL) The league would be owned and operated by the national body in accordance with its new constitution for the next 20 seasons.

RABAT: Organisers at the Africa Cup of Nations in Morocco are allowing supporters in for free after kick-off in matches where stadiums are not full, a Confederation of African Football source told AFP.The Group F game between Cameroon and Gabon on Wednesday in Agadir kicked off in front of almost empty stands but the ground filled up significantly over the course of the first half despite incessant rain.The official attendance was later announced as 35,200 inside a venue which can hold over 45,000.There have been similar scenes at numerous matches across the opening days of the competition, even leading to confusion over the attendance figures themselves.The crowd at Tuesday's Group D encounter between the Democratic Republic of Congo and Benin at Rabat's Al Medina Stadium -- which filled up considerably over the course of the game -- was initially announced as 6,703 before later being corrected to 13,073.The CAF source indicated that organisers, in agreement with African football's governing body, were opening stands around 20 minutes into games to allow fans gathered outside to enter without paying.Filling stadiums is an important issue for Cup of Nations organisers in Morocco, for which a successful hosting of the tournament is key as it builds towards the 2030 World Cup to be jointly held in the North African country, Spain and Portugal.CAF's official ticketing platform on Thursday showed seats available for almost all remaining group matches for prices starting at 100 dirhams ($10.96).The only matches shown as sell-outs were hosts Morocco's games against Mali on Friday and Zambia on Monday, as well as Algeria against Burkina Faso on Sunday and Algeria versus Equatorial Guinea next Wednesday.","Africa Cup of Nations organisers are allowing supporters in for free after kick- off in matches where stadiums are not full.

Where did it all go wrong for Indian football?

FC Goa players made a strong statement during their AFC Champions League 2 match against FC Istiklol by staging a silent protest before kick-off on Wednesday at the Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium.As the referee blew the whistle for kick-off, the FC Goa players staged the pre-planned protest and did not play for a few seconds.The protest was aimed at highlighting the “deepening uncertainty” that is affecting the Indian football ecosystem.Issues related to administration and commercial matters have caused major delays around top-tier domestic football competitions like the Indian Super League and the I-League.Players, coaches, and staff across clubs are feeling the impact of this situation.Soon after the incident, FC Goa released a statement on social media to explain their action.“This action was solely intended to draw attention to the broader challenges facing the domestic football ecosystem,” the club said in an official statement.FC Goa also made it clear that the protest was not against their opponents or the Asian Football Confederation.Instead, it was meant to show the frustration and concern felt by those involved in Indian football, who are unsure about the future of the game in the country.On the field, FC Goa started well despite the tense backdrop. The home team took the lead in the eighth minute when Dejan Drazic found space inside the box and scored with a fine curling shot into the top corner.In the second half, Istiklol made a strong comeback. A defensive mistake allowed Paul Komolafe to score the equaliser in the 53rd minute.Just three minutes later, another error led to a penalty, which Amirbek Juraboev converted to put the visitors ahead.FC Goa tried hard to score an equaliser, but their efforts did not succeed.Istiklol held on to win 2-1.

Lionel Messi India trip: Mumbai out in numbers for the superstar





No takers for game





Court hearings, President's appeal, sports ministry intervention





Women and juniors shine

NEW DELHI: Indian football remained in a state of terminal decline after experiencing arguably its darkest phase in a year marked by severe administrative crisis, court hearings, financial issues, absence of domestic leagues, and a steep decline in performance of the senior men's team.As the year drew to a close, the high-profile Lionel Messi GOAT India Tour generated some interest and forced a conversation around the sport.The much-publicised event did what it was meant to, and was not supposed to serve as a catalyst for real improvement in Indian football.If its own problems were not enough, the chaos and absolute disorder at Salt Lake Stadium on the first day of the Messi tour added to the embarrassment.While the breakdown of law and order in the 'Mecca of Indian football' was not good advertisement, the remaining three legs in Hyderabad, Mumbai and Delhi were well organised.Of the many disappointments, one on-field moment that still stings came when little-known Bangladeshi midfielder Sheikh Morsalin darted into the box and slipped the ball between the legs of Gurpreet Singh Sandhu with a delicate touch, completing another round of humiliation.The 11th minute strike, in an inconsequential 2027 AFC Asian Cup qualifying match on a November evening in Dhaka, meant the Indian senior men's team suffered its first defeat to Bangladesh in 22 years, after having struggled through the last 12 months to produce a result of any significance.While several factors contribute to a country's overall football ecosystem, globally the senior team's performance is often the most visible metric, and India was found severely wanting on that front.Unlike in 2024, when the team drew a blank in international matches, the Indian senior men's side did manage to churn out a few wins occasionally this year, including a bronze medal finish at the CAFA Nations Cup in the central Asian countries of Tajikistan and Uzbekistan in September.But, in the matches that mattered the most, India failed to deliver and could not qualify for the Asian Cup for the first time since the 2011 edition, following which the team plummeted further in the FIFA rankings.Besides Bangladesh, the team also suffered defeats to other lower-ranked opponents such as Hong Kong and Singapore, a 1-2 loss to whom dashed its hopes of entering the Asian Cup following a disappointing campaign in the Qualifications.While the men's team struggled on the field, especially when it came to scoring goals, the administrators grappled with issues off it.The game remained in the middle of a crisis due to the All India Football Federation's failure to secure a new commercial partner for the Indian Super League after its previous contract with the Reliance-owned Football Sports Development Limited (FSDL) expired on December 8.On expected lines, the lack of a commercial partner has had a crippling effect on the game. The ISL, which would have been into its third month now under normal circumstances, remains on hold.The sponsors are pulling out, clubs have put their operations on hold, players are staring at an uncertain future, after having implored each and every stakeholder to resolve the issue, and serious doubts hover over the domestic leagues' future.The ongoing crisis has highlighted a systemic failure in the country's football ecosystem brought about by poor governance, lack of long-term vision and the absence of proper youth development programmes.The year was also marked by frequent hearings at the Supreme Court and intervention from the union sports ministry to resolve the crisis. Even President Droupadi Murmu asked the stakeholders of Indian football to work together for the upliftment of the game in the country, reflecting the severity of the situation.When the Supreme Court approved the draft Constitution of the AIFF, prepared by former apex court judge L Nageswara Rao, in September, it was believed that a solution amenable to all concerned parties would finally be arrived at.However, no such thing happened in the ensuing months.Amid the gloom surrounding the sport, the women's national teams and the junior squads have impressed with their performances, raising hopes of a better future. In Chiang Mai, Thailand in July, the women's team scripted history by qualifying directly for the AFC Women's Asian Cup 2026, a feat never achieved before.Up against regional heavyweights and hosts Thailand in the final, the Indian women rode on Sangita Basfore's brilliant brace to emerge winners and make a statement of sorts. The achievement reminded one of former AIFF president Praful Patel's old statement that chances of the Indian women's team playing in a FIFA World Cup before their male counterparts are higher.While the girls still have a long way to go, they are definitely moving in the right direction.In another milestone, Indian Women's League reigning champions East Bengal FC became the first team from the country to win a main-draw match in the AFC Women's Champions League, helping the side earn a direct spot in the league stages of the next edition.As far as the junior teams were concerned, the India squad lifted its seventh SAFF U-17 Championship title in Sri Lanka, edging out Bangladesh in a dramatic final that went to penalties after a 2-2 stalemate.Under the guidance of Bibiano Fernandes, India then shocked continental giants Iran 2-1 to qualify for their 10th U-17 Asian Cup finals, even as the struggle to monetise the sport continued without a solution in sight.",Indian football remained in a state of terminal decline after experiencing arguably its darkest phase in a year marked by severe administrative crisis.

The return of war

A story that lives on

On Christmas morning in 1914, something happened that no military plan could have predicted and no weapon could have forced. In the middle of World War I , one of the bloodiest conflicts in human history, soldiers laid down their guns and stepped out of their trenches. And what did they do? They ended up playing football.For a few precious hours, war made way for humanity. This moment, now known as the Christmas Truce, remains one of the most powerful stories ever told about football and peace.Fought between the Allied Powers, backed by France, Britain, Russia, later joined by the US, Italy, and Japan, and the Central Powers, led by Germany, Austria-Hungary, the Ottoman Empire, and Bulgaria, World War I had erupted in the summer of 1914.Europe was torn apart as nations rushed into battle with confidence and somewhat misplaced optimism.Many soldiers believed the war would be short.“Home by Christmas,” they said.Instead, by December, the war had stalled into a brutal deadlock. Soldiers on both sides were trapped in muddy trenches across Belgium and northern France.Life there was unbearable. Freezing cold, constant shelling, disease, hunger, and fear became daily companions.Young men, many of whom were barely out of school, faced death every hour.Christmas was approaching, but joy felt impossible.On the night of December 24, something strange happened along parts of the Western Front. British soldiers heard singing coming from the German trenches.At first, they suspected a trick. But the tune was unmistakable. The Germans were singing Christmas carols.“Stille Nacht”, which translates to Silent Night in English, floated gently through the cold air. British troops replied with their own songs.Soon, laughter replaced gunfire. Shouts of “Merry Christmas!” crossed no man’s land, the deadly strip of ground that usually meant instant death.Against all logic, the blazing sounds of gunfire went silent.As dawn broke on Christmas Day, soldiers cautiously climbed out of their trenches. Hands raised. No weapons. No orders. No one fired.British and German soldiers met in the middle. They shook hands. They smiled awkwardly. They exchanged cigarettes, chocolate, buttons, badges, and even small gifts sent from home.Photographs of loved ones were shown. Stories were shared. For the first time, soldiers saw the faces of the men they had been told to hate. They discovered something shocking. The enemy looked just like them.Then came the football. In some places, it was a proper leather football. In others, it was a bundle of rags tied together. It didn’t matter. There were no goalposts, no referee, no rules. Hwever, soldiers marked goals with caps or coats. Their boots were heavy, and the ground was frozen and uneven. But they couldn't care less.British soldiers kicked the ball with German soldiers. Scores were kept loosely, if at all.Some accounts claim the Germans won one match 3–2. Others say the result didn’t matter, because the real victory was simply playing.Soldiers used the calm to recover bodies that had been lying in no man’s land for weeks. Joint burial services were held. Prayers were said together.Men who would soon be ordered to kill each other stood side by side in silence.Many later wrote letters home describing how surreal it felt.One British soldier wrote that it seemed “too wonderful to be real.” Another admitted he struggled afterwards to fire at men he had just shared laughter with.The Christmas Truce was never officially approved. High-ranking officers were furious when they learned what had happened. To them, the truce threatened discipline and the will to fight.Orders were quickly sent down the line. By December 26, the guns roared again. The war resumed its brutal course. Many of the men who played football that day would be killed in the months that followed.For years, the Christmas Truce was pushed aside. Military leaders feared it showed too much humanity in war. Some reports were censored. Others were ignored. But stories have a way of surviving.Letters were found in attics. Diaries were published. Veterans spoke quietly of that day when the war stopped making sense. Slowly, the truth emerged.Football already belonged to everyone in 1914. It was played in England, Germany, France, and beyond. It needed no shared language. No explanation. You just kicked the ball.That simplicity made football powerful. It reminded soldiers of home. Of weekends. Of joy. Of life before the trenches.Football did not end the war. But it proved that hatred was learned, and humanity was natural.Today, more than a century later, the Christmas Truce is remembered across the football world. Memorial matches are held. Statues stand near former battlefields. Clubs and fans share the story every December.Because on Christmas Day in 1914, football did something extraordinary. It reminded the world that before we are soldiers, enemies, or nations, we are human beings. And sometimes, a simple game is enough to make us remember that.","In the middle of World War I, soldiers laid down their guns and stepped out of their trenches.

Justin Herbert and Madison Beer bring balance beyond football



Justin Herbert and Madison Beer are finding their own rhythm at a moment when pressure, performance, and public attention collide. With the Los Angeles Chargers surging toward the postseason, the quarterback’s life feels balanced between Sunday stakes and quieter sources of strength away from the field. The Chargers entered Saturday’s clash against the Houston Texans with confidence and momentum. But they lost the game by 16-20.Justin Herbert has been central to that edge. Across 15 games, he has thrown for 3,491 yards with 25 touchdowns. Away from the stadium lights, Herbert’s relationship with Madison Beer has drawn attention for reasons that extend beyond celebrity curiosity. First linked in the fall, the two moved from quiet speculation to public confirmation in October, appearing together on the Chargers’ sideline and later at several events. The visibility sparked headlines, but the substance of their connection became clearer through Beer’s own words.On Dec. 10, Beer appeared on the “Call Her Daddy” podcast and spoke about the emotional support she said Herbert provides. “I feel, like, taken care of in a way that I can break down and like I have someone to lean on. And I think it’s important,” Beer said.Those words carried weight because they arrived alongside honest reflections on mental health and past trauma.Beer has been open about her journey, and she framed the relationship as a source of grounding during an intense professional phase. Rather than glamour, she emphasized reliability and presence, qualities often overlooked in public narratives.As the Chargers chase playoff positioning, herbert's focus remains sharp. And Beer will be by his side. The loss for the Chargers means that the Denver Broncos have won the AFC West. Next week’s matchup will be simply for playoff positioning and not the division title.Also Read: Travis Kelce reveals the unexpected person guiding his retirement decision, and it’s not who fans think","Los Angeles Chargers quarterback Justin Herbert and girlfriend Madison Beer have been linked since the fall.

Christian McCaffrey and Olivia Culpo embrace game day parenthood

Christian McCaffrey and Olivia Culpo have entered a season of life that has quietly reshaped everything, including how game days feel. For the San Francisco 49ers star, football still demands focus and intensity, but something deeper now grounds him before kickoff. The moment he sees his five month old daughter, Colette, the noise fades. What remains is purpose, clarity, and calm.That feeling has followed McCaffrey through a demanding NFL schedule. Between travel, treatments, and preparation, family time is limited. Still, those brief moments matter more than ever. Fatherhood has added weight to every snap, not pressure, but meaning. It has changed how he walks onto the field and why he plays.In a recent conversation with People, McCaffrey spoke openly about the impact of having his family present before games. ""My family is one of the reasons I play,"" he said. ""Whenever you get to see them right before you go out to battle, it's a quick reminder of why you're doing it."" The presence of his daughter, even at such a young age, carries emotional significance.""It means everything to have my family there,"" he added. ""I got to watch my dad play when I was a kid.I know my daughter won't remember it, but just knowing she was there and able to be present when I played means a lot to me.""Olivia Culpo has embraced the moment just as fully. Known for her style and attention to detail, she has already made game day outfits a family affair. McCaffrey laughed when asked about it, saying, ""Yeah, if you know her mom, she'll dress her up, that's for sure."" Those small touches have turned stadium visits into shared memories.The couple also keeps expectations simple during the holidays. With football dictating the calendar, tradition looks different right now. ""Our lives are so hectic, especially during football season,"" McCaffrey explained. ""We're just blessed if we can get our family together."" For now, that is enough.In a league driven by results, McCaffrey’s story is a reminder. Success is not only measured in yards or wins, but in who you see before the lights come on.Also Read: Christian McCaffrey’s wife Olivia Culpo reflects on a difficult behind-the-scenes Super Bowl LIX experience","San Francisco 49ers star Christian McCaffrey has a five-month-old daughter, Colette.

Myles Garrett earns Chloe Kim’s respect beyond the spotlight

Myles Garrett and Chloe Kim's relationship grew quietly, without attention or hype, built on respect and simply being there for one another. As Kim prepares for another Olympic season, the way she speaks about Garrett shows how much his presence matters in her life.With the 2026 Winter Olympics approaching, Kim is entering one of the most demanding stretches of her career. The offseason, she admits, is the hardest part mentally. Anxiety creeps in before competition begins. Amid that pressure, she finds grounding in people who truly see her. That includes Garrett, whose work ethic and character have left a deep impression on her.Kim spoke candidly about how little she knew of Garrett before they met. “I grew up in a very Korean household, so we didn’t really watch American sports, or sports in general,” she said. Her sports knowledge was limited. “Like I know Tom Brady and LeBron James. That’s my extent, that’s all I know.” What started without expectations has grown into genuine admiration.What stands out to Kim is not Garrett’s accolades, but who he is away from cameras. “Honestly, Myles is such an incredible athlete,” she said.“I’m constantly inspired and in awe of him and how hard he works and how incredibly kind he is.” That balance matters to her. Kindness, she emphasized, is not performative. “He genuinely is one of the kindest people I think I’ve ever met.”For Kim, who has openly discussed years of mental health struggles, that steadiness carries weight. She described how pressure built over time, eventually forcing her to confront her limits through intensive therapy after the 2022 Olympics. The support systems around her now feel clearer.Her appreciation for Garrett reflects that shift. “I’m really lucky to be part of his life and lucky that he’s part of mine,” Kim said. “Yeah, we’re happy.” The words are simple, but they land with honesty.As Kim returns to competition, she carries lessons learned the hard way. Confidence does not mean fear disappears. It means knowing who stands beside you when it shows up. For Chloe Kim, Myles Garrett represents that presence that is quiet, supportive and steady.Also Read: Who is Myles Garrett’s girlfriend Chloe Kim?

“So grateful to have her ”: Aaron Rodgers opens up about the emotional shift that came with meeting his wife,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/so-grateful-to-have-her-aaron-rodgers-opens-up-about-the-emotional-shift-that-came-with-meeting-his-wife/articleshow/126204184.cms,"Aaron Rodgers has confirmed he is happily married but insists his wife will remain completely private. While praising the stability and love she brings to his life, the quarterback strongly rejected public curiosity and speculation. Rodgers said his wife never chose fame and emphasized that his personal life will stay off-limits, regardless of outside pressure or criticism.

Aaron Rodgers doubles down on privacy and rejects public entitlement

Aaron Rodgers has always lived in the public eye, but when it comes to his marriage, he is drawing a firm line. The Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback is embracing a deeply personal chapter while making one thing unmistakably clear. His wife will remain out of the spotlight. That choice, he says, is not secrecy. It is protection.Just weeks after confirming he is married, Rodgers shared a rare insight into how marriage has reshaped his life. His words were open, emotional, and deliberate. The details, however, stopped there. For Rodgers, love does not require visibility, and happiness does not need validation from strangers.The veteran quarterback described the emotional shift that came with meeting his wife, Brittani. “When you meet the right one, and you’re with the right one, your world changes in a second,” he said. “To have that person who loves you unconditionally behind the scenes, there’s no better feeling in the world.”Rodgers did not hide his gratitude. “I’ve got the most incredible wife,” he added. “I just really love her and I’m so grateful to have her by my side at the end. When you have that stability and that rock behind you at the house, you feel like you could do anything.”Still, admiration does not mean access. Rodgers has faced criticism for refusing to share photos or personal details about his wife. He has not softened his stance. During a recent appearance, he pushed back forcefully against speculation. “It’s a sick society isn’t it?” he asked. “I lived in the public eye for 20 years. I had a public relationship. How did that work out?”Rodgers explained that his wife never signed up for fame and fully supports staying private. “I'm with somebody who’s private, who doesn't want to be in the public eye, didn't sign up to be a celebrity and because I do things in private, because I want my personal life to be private, now I'm weird,” he said. “My private life is my private life and it's going to stay that way.”Now 41, Rodgers insists fans should expect no shift in approach. He may share moments of gratitude, but names, photos, and personal access are off the table. As he bluntly put it, “The entitlement to information about my private life is so f—-ng ridiculous and embarrassing.”For Aaron Rodgers, marriage is not a performance. It is something he plans to keep exactly where it belongs. At home.Also Read: “A senior citizen…”: Steelers fans urges Aaron Rodgers to retire and focus on life with wife Brittani","Aaron Rodgers has confirmed he is happily married.

Away from public noise, Bündchen has focused on healing with Joaquim Valente, her husband. She has chosen simplicity, privacy, and honesty, even as curiosity around her personal life refuses to fade.For Bündchen, the loudest headlines came after her marriage ended, not during it. Rumors followed quickly, forcing her to confront a familiar narrative. “I really don’t want to make my life a tabloid,” she said. When accusations suggested infidelity, she responded clearly and without hesitation. “That is a lie.”She framed the issue as larger than herself. “This is something that happens to a lot of women who get blamed when they have the courage to leave an unhealthy relationship and are labeled as being unfaithful,” she said.Rather than dissect the past, she emphasized perspective. “No one really knows what happens between two people, only the two people in the relationship.”Bündchen confirmed she is dating again but with caution and care. “This is the first time I am seeing someone that was a friend of mine first,” she said. “It’s very different. It is very honest, and it’s very transparent.”Beyond relationships, she has turned inward, focusing on health, motherhood, and creative work, including her upcoming cookbook.

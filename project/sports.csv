Cricket fans at The Oval witnessed a lighthearted moment on Day 3 of the fifth and final Test between India and England when Ravindra Jadeja politely asked a spectator to change his t-shirt mid-match.The moment unfolded while Jadeja was batting, only to be distracted by a fan seated behind the bowler’s arm wearing a bright red t-shirt.The colour seemed to interfere with Jadeja’s sightline, a common issue for players when trying to focus on the ball coming out of the bowler’s hand.Rather than create a scene, Jadeja simply informed the on-field umpire about the problem. After security personnel and match officials approached the individual, he eventually agreed to change his t-shirt.Instead of moving, the spectator gamely switched into a grey t-shirt right then and there, drawing cheers from the crowd.Watch:Jadeja gave him a thumbs-up and a grin, diffusing the situation with trademark charm.The incident, caught on camera, quickly went viral, with social media hailing it as yet another reason to love Jadeja’s on-field personality.On the cricketing front, India finished Day 3 in a dominant position. Yashasvi Jaiswal starred with a composed 118, while Akash Deep impressed with a maiden Test fifty, scoring 66 and adding crucial lower-order runs. Washington Sundar provided a late-innings blitz, including three sixes in five balls, propelling India to a second-innings total of 396.England’s response began steadily, with Crawley and Duckett putting up a 50-run stand. But Mohammed Siraj broke through on the final ball of the day, clean bowling Crawley for 14 with a deadly yorker.At stumps, England were 50/1, needing another 324 runs for victory with two days to go—an uphill battle against a confident Indian side. But amidst the serious contest, Jadeja’s fan interaction was a timely reminder of the joy cricket can bring.","Ravindra Jadeja politely asked a spectator to change his t-shirt mid-match.

Poll Can England successfully chase down the 374-run target set by India? Yes, definitely! No, it's too high.

TimesofIndia.com in London: England pacer Josh Tongue admitted that bowling a bowler short on Day 3 was always going to be a tough challenge, but remained calm about the fourth-innings chase as the hosts were set a daunting 374-run target by India in the final Test at The Oval.“It was always going to be a tough ask for us bowlers,” said Tongue after stumps on Saturday. “But we’re pretty chilled. Not overthinking the target. With the batting line-up we’ve got, there’s no reason why we can’t chase it.”Tongue also spoke about how the pitch has changed over the course of three days. “There was a bit in it early on, but the heavy roller seemed to flatten it. Still, the odd one is jumping from length.”When asked about a potential Ashes tour later this year, the fast bowler brushed it aside. “Not thinking ahead right now,” he said.Tongue, who was taken for a few by nightwatchman Akash Deep, admitted the lower-order runs were frustrating. “He got a few runs. That hurt.”India had earlier taken charge of the match with a fine hundred from Yashasvi Jaiswal and a fiery 66 from Akash Deep, who shared a century stand in the morning session. Washington Sundar then smashed a 46-ball 53 as India set a record target of 374 — the highest ever set at The Oval in Test cricket.At the close of play, England were 50 for 1, with Siraj removing Crawley just before stumps. With two full days left, the match is still open, though India look firmly on top.

Greenstone Lobo predicts result of India vs England fifth Test | What's in the stars?

The leap of faith, punch in the air and the helmet was off in a flash. The gloves were next as he took a few steps back after placing his gear on the ground and started blowing multiple kisses towards the section which houses the dressing room and multiple hospitality boxes. At level one were his teammates, the second floor had his parents and enjoying the game from the hospitality suite was former India Test captain Rohit Sharma . The kisses were followed by a gesture where he made a heart with the fingers of his two hands.He thoroughly enjoyed reaching three figures and would have certainly meant the world to him because it came in front of his ""Rohit bhai"". It wasn't a typical Jaiswal hundred where he exercised control and dominated the opposition but looked very determined to get a big one in what had been a quiet series by his lofty standards, and against an opposition he has had a lot of success against.A hundred in the first innings of the series was followed by just two fifties in the next seven, and the pressure of his own expectations would have certainly increased after an early departure in the first innings of fifth Test. The left-hander was the leading run-getter - 391 runs in five Tests - for the side in Australia and had a bumper home season when England toured India last season where he amassed 712 runs in the five Tests.The second essay at The Oval presented him with an opportunity to end the series on a high and the stakes couldn't have been bigger. With the match reduced to almost a single-inning shootout, the visitors needed a solid start and all eyes were on the pair of KL Rahul and Jaiswal. The former got out early, next man in Sai Sudharsan too didn't last long but Jaiswal carried on. First to see off the nervy period with nightwatchman Akash Deep towards the end of Day 2, and then to pile on the misery on the hosts, a bowler short, in the morning session of Day 3.The 23-year-old was dropped twice, played and missed plenty of times but stayed at it. The rub of the green did go his way and even though he never looked in control, he rode his luck and operated with a mature head to give India a solid foundation. But for Jaiswal, more than the innings or the situation in which it came, what would have mattered more is the fact that it allowed him to get a sense of reassurance. Runs at home, in Australia and now England.Not many have managed to do what the southpaw has so early in his career and his hunger for runs, and big runs, doesn't seem to die down any soon. Whether it's the eve of the match or even morning of his inning, he doesn't waste an opportunity to knock a fair few in the nets and likes to be in the zone. Sticking to the ""process"" continues to be the key word and his approach is not at all complicated.Very chatty with his partners, aware of the fields and itching to get on top of the bowlers, continue to be the ingredients which allow him to serve that delicious dish on most occasions he goes out to bat for the country. Jaiswal's sixth hundred in the format, and fourth against England, not only allowed India to set a stiff target for the opposition but reaffirmed why he continues to be an asset for the side at top of the order in the format.Ever since he occupied the position, and later combined with Rahul, India's opening woes have become a thing of the past and that's likely to be the case in the home season which follows.For Jaiswal, however, home or away has hardly mattered as he continues to deal in tons, and the heart celebration could well become the coolest celebration of town!","Yashasvi Jaiswal scored his sixth hundred in the format.

Poll Should MS Dhoni continue playing for CSK in the next IPL season? Yes, he should continue No, it's time to retire

NEW DELHI: Mahendra Singh Dhoni has once again sidestepped retirement speculation, instead turning the spotlight on Chennai Super Kings ’ (CSK) disappointing IPL campaign and the urgent need for a squad overhaul.Speaking at the inauguration of the Maxvision Eye Super Speciality Hospital in Chennai, the former India captain admitted that CSK have ""holes"" to fix and need to start afresh ahead of the next season.The five-time champions endured one of their worst seasons in IPL history, finishing at the bottom of the table with just four wins in 14 matches. With regular skipper Ruturaj Gaikwad sidelined, Dhoni had to step in as captain midway through a campaign marred by inconsistency and injury setbacks.“There were certain holes that we need to plug in. I think our batting order is quite sorted out now. Rutu will be coming back. A small auction is coming in December… We will try to plug those in,” Dhoni said.Despite his advancing age — Dhoni turned 44 last month — and the speculation swirling around his playing future, the veteran remains CSK’s primary wicketkeeper. However, he emphasised that individual legacy means little if the team falters.“The beauty of sport is how good you look on paper doesn’t matter. What you do consistently over a period of time matters.You have to pull your socks up once you reach the knockouts and win with two or three big performances. That’s how trophies are won,” he said.Reflecting on back-to-back underwhelming seasons, Dhoni didn’t sugarcoat CSK’s decline: “The last couple of years have not been good for us. We have not, you can say, been up to the mark. What is important is to see the learnings.”And while fans remain uncertain whether Dhoni will don the yellow jersey again, he made it clear that CSK’s focus is firmly on rebuilding. “Next year, when you turn up again, you have to start from scratch,” he concluded.",Mahendra Singh Dhoni admits Chennai Super Kings have 'holes' to fix.

Poll Will England successfully chase the 374-run target set by India? Yes, they will achieve it No, they will not It will be very close

NEW DELHI: England’s Bazball brigade faces its sternest test yet as they gear up to chase a mammoth 374-run target set by India in the fifth and final Test at The Oval. If successful, it would be the highest fourth-innings chase ever achieved at this historic venue — shattering a record that has stood since 1902.India’s second-innings total of 396 — powered by Yashasvi Jaiswal ’s second century of the series (118), and impactful fifties from Akash Deep (66), Ravindra Jadeja (53), and Washington Sundar (53) — has left England with a mountain to climb.No team has successfully chased more than 263 at The Oval in the fourth innings — a record England set over a century ago in their one-wicket win over Australia. To overhaul that by 111 runs would demand not only Bazball’s signature aggression but near-flawless execution.England’s top two successful chases in history — 378 against India in 2022 (Edgbaston) and 371 against India earlier this series in Leeds — both came on flatter tracks. But The Oval’s variable bounce and wearing pitch pose a different challenge altogether.India, resuming on 75/2 on Day 3, rode on a 107-run partnership between Jaiswal and nightwatchman Akash Deep. Jadeja and Sundar continued the pressure, even as England’s bowlers, hampered by the absence of Chris Woakes and six dropped catches, struggled to contain the flow of runs.Jaiswal’s hundred came off 127 balls, decorated with 12 fours and two sixes. Akash Deep, playing only his tenth Test, impressed with his maiden fifty. Sundar’s 53 off just 46 balls added vital late runs.Captain Shubman Gill’s 11 took his series tally to 754 — just 20 runs shy of Sunil Gavaskar’s all-time Indian Test series record.England now have just over two days to rewrite history. Can they do it, or will India clinch a famous series-leveling win in London?",India's second-innings total of 396 has left England with a mountain to climb.

The quiet coach

Long before Khalid Jamil became Indian football’s headline appointment—long before his name was etched in I-League history as the architect of Aizawl FC’s fairytale title run, and long before he coached in the ISL— he was just a young midfielder at Air India , lingering behind after training.He’d buy tea and samosas for his coach, Bimal Ghosh, pull out a chair, and request that he stay back a little longer. Just one more hour, he’d ask. Just one more drill. And then he’d train like a madman. “He used to come early and would be the last to leave,” Ghosh recalls. “I’d be sipping chai and watching him run, trying shooting drills. I’ve never seen anyone train like that.” That madness—disciplined, unrelenting, and almost monk-like in its obsession— has now taken Khalid Jamil to Indian football’s highest seat: Head coach of the national team. And few appointments have felt as honest, and as earned, as this one.A commanding central midfielder, he plied his trade with Air India and Mahindra United, known for his nononsense style, leadership, and consistency. Former teammate Godfrey Pereira, who shared the Air India dressing room with him and later did AFC ALicense coaching alongside him, remembers him as the most disciplined man on the field.“He used to travel all the way from Mira Road to Kalina— never late, never missing training,” Godfrey says. “And as a coach, he’s carried that same spirit. ” What sets Khalid apart is that he never took shortcuts. He built Mumbai FC from the ground up, and shocked the country in 2017 by leading Aizawl FC—a club with one of the league’ssmallest budgets—to an ILeague title.Perhaps Jamil’s biggest strength is his ability to understand players—not just their strengths and weaknesses, but their psychology.Steven Dias, who played with him at Air India and Mahindra and now serves as his assistant coach at Jamshedpur FC, describes him as a coach who never overburdens players. “He understands every player’s capacity,” Dias says. “For instance, when I played under him at Mumbai FC, he gave me complete freedom in attack. He didn’t ask me to defend. That’s his genius.”Jamil doesn’t come from a PR-polished world. He isn’t active on social media. He speaks little—and when he does, it’s straight to the point.“He doesn’t say thank you or sorry,” Godfrey chuckles. “He expects results.” And perhaps that’s why he stands out. His appointment to the top post is also a huge boost for homegrown coaches.","Khalid Jamil is the new head coach of the Indian national team.

AHMEDABAD: When 18-yearold Khushbu Saroj walks on to the pitch at Thuwunna Stadium in Yangon on Aug 6 to face Indonesia in the AFC U-20 Women’s Asian Cup Qualifiers, she’ll carry more than just a jersey with the Indian tricolour — she’ll carry a dream that once seemed impossible.The daughter of a humble gardener, Khushbu has been named in India’s 23-member squad for the continental tournament. Hailing from Ahmedabad, she is joined by Tapi district’s Shubhangi Singh as the two Gujarat players in the squad. For Khushbu, this is not just a football match — it’s a moment of quiet triumph against years of doubt, social resistance, and hardship.“My father works as a gardener in people’s homes. He used to be ridiculed by his friends for letting me leave the house in shorts to play football,” Khushbu recalls. “He would often tell me, ‘ Kuch bhi nahi rakha in sab cheezo mein ’ (There’s no future in such things). But my mother and sisters never gave up on me. They were my strength.”Her journey began in the narrow lanes of Ahmedabad, where she first kicked a ball after watching seniors play at her school. What started as curiosity quickly turned into a passion. But the path wasn’t easy. Her father’s reluctance and societal judgment weighed heavily on the family.Still, Khushbu persisted.It wasn’t until she earned a spot in the Gujarat state team that her father’s attitude began to shift. “When I finally wore the India jersey and returned from Thailand after my first international tournament, my parents came to receive me. They were filled with pride,” she says, a smile audible in her voice.Her coach at Kahaani FC, Lalita Saini, played a pivotal role in her rise. “Lalita ma’am was like a second mother. She guided me in everything – diet, discipline, mental strength. When I got injured in 2022 and my parents asked if I should quit the sport, Lalita ma’am told me injuries are just part of a player’s life. The real story is in making a comeback.”Khushbu’s father’s words today are a stark contrast to the doubts of past: “I used to stop her when she went for training. Today, I’m proud of her.”Her mother’s eyes well up as she added, “People used to mock her. Today feels like a dream. We never imagined our daughter would play for India.”From Ahmedabad to Yangon, Khushbu Saroj’s story is one of perseverance, passion, and quiet revolution – a testament to the power of belief in oneself.",Khushbu Saroj named in India's 23-member squad for AFC U-20 Women's Asian Cup Qualifiers.

PANAJI: The All India Football Federation (AIFF) has cleared the path for Khalid Jamil to take over as coach of the national football team.Should Jamil — currently coaching Jamshedpur FC — agree to the terms offered by the AIFF in the next 24 to 48 hours, he will become the first Indian as full-time coach since Sukhvinder Singh in 2005. Two other Indians, Armando Colaco and Savio Medeira, held interim charges, following the sacking of Bob Houghton in 2011.“It was felt the federation must give an opportunity to an Indian coach,” the AIFF said after its executive committee meeting on Friday. “The members felt that since India are set to participate in the CAFA Nations Cup this month, followed by back-toback AFC Asian Cup final round qualifiers (against Singapore in October), Jamil would be a better option, since he has been working with Indian players on a regular basis. ”AIFF technical director Syed Sabir Pasha and national teams director Subrata Paul presented a SWOT analysis of all the three shortlisted coaches – Jamil, Stephen Constantine, and Stefan Tarkovic. While the mood was in favour of an Indian coach, a “strong recommendation” from technical committee chairperson and former India captain IM Vijayan helped members decide.In its presentation, AIFF said Jamil’s playing style is easy for the players to adapt, and that he is “known to create teams that are hard to score against.” An AFC pro coaching license holder since 2015, the 48-yearold has managed over 200 games in the I-League with stints at clubs like Mumbai FC, Aizawl FC – with whom he scripted a fairytale I-League triumph – East Bengal and Mohun Bagan. In the Indian Super League (ISL), now the top-tier league, he has guided NorthEast United FC and Jamshedpur to the semifinals, despite being teams with much lower budgets.Jamil’s teams are known to be disciplined and well drilled. It’s no secret either that he likes to work with a core group of players who he has trusted through his career, none of them big names or superstars.“At Mohun Bagan and East Bengal, two of the biggest clubs Khalid has managed, he was never really successful,” said Pradhyum Reddy, Dempo’s technical director who has formerly coached in both I-League and ISL. “The question is whether he can manage the egos (in the national team dressing room) or get rid of the egos.”Others feel Jamil’s lack of experience with international football can prove to be challenging.“Khalid was the best option among the three coaches who were shortlisted. But purely from a technical point of view, it’s not the best appointment,” said Reddy.Many feel the AIFF were left with no choice than make a domestic coach appointment due to the precarious state of its finances. The budgets, according to sources, have been approved only till December, when the 15-year agreement with its marketing partners comes to an end.“Without an assured annual payment of Rs 50 crore (from the marketing partners), AIFF will be left with nothing. At times like these, hiring an experienced Indian coach makes perfect sense,” said one member.AIFF sources said the plan is to offer Jamil a two-year contract with a one-year extension clause. Neither party is in favour of a dual club-andcountry role.● Youngest Indian coach to win the I-League.● Most number of matches in I-League by any coach.● First full-time Indian coach in ISL, with NorthEast United and now Jamshedpur.● Guided Aizawl FC to a historic I-League title in 2017, finishing a point ahead of Mohun Bagan.● Reached ISL semifinals with NorthEast and Jamshedpur. Super Cup finalist with East Bengal (2018) and Jamshedpur (2025).● Made his national team debut in 1997 in a SAFF Cup match against Bangladesh in Kathmandu.● Played 15 matches for India till his retirement in 2006 due to injuries.Tajikistan vs IndiaIndia vs IranAfghanistan vs IndiaSingapore vs IndiaIndia vs SingaporeBangladesh vs India","The All India Football Federation (AIFF) has cleared the path for Khalid Jamil to take over as coach of the national football team.

Poll Do you believe that appointing an Indian coach for the national team is a step forward for Indian football? Yes, it shows trust in Indian managers No, we need international experience

Khalid Jamil, appointed as the new head coach of the Indian men’s football team on August 1, 2025, brings with him decades of experience and a deep understanding of the domestic game. Born in Kuwait City on April 21, 1977 to Punjabi parents, Jamil's early love for football was shaped by an under-14 camp where he met French legend Michel Platini. .After moving to India, Jamil turned down early offers from clubs like East Bengal and Mohun Bagan due to sponsorship reasons. He began his playing career with Mahindra United and later turned out for Air India and Mumbai FC.As a midfielder, he earned 40 international caps for India between 1998 and 2006 before injuries forced him to retire in 2009.Jamil's true impact, however, has been as a manager. Starting with Mumbai FC in 2009, he built a reputation for doing more with less. Over seven seasons, he kept the club competitive in the I-League despite limited resources.His biggest achievement came with Aizawl FC in the 2016/17 season, when he guided the underdog club to a historic I-League title , which was also the first ever by a team from Northeast India. The triumph made his name even more popular and showcased his ability to build winning teams.Stints with East Bengal, Mohun Bagan, and NorthEast United followed. In the 2020/21 season, he became the first Indian coach to guide a team to the ISL playoffs, leading NorthEast on a 10-match unbeaten run. Later, he was also named as the league’s first permanent Indian head coach with the same club.Jamil has also coached Bengaluru United, Nepal's Chitwan FC, and Jamshedpur FC, with valuable experience across various levels. With Jamshedpur, he led the side to a Super Cup semi-final in 2024.Now at the helm of the Indian national team and the first Indian to take on the role since 2012 , the 48-year-old brings a grounded, hard-working, and tactical approach. Known for his deep tactical understanding and ability to connect with players, his appointment shows India's attitude in putting trust in Indian managers and a step forward in shaping the next phase of Indian football.","Khalid Jamil has been appointed as the new head coach of the Indian men’s football team on August 1, 2025.

With Khalid Jamil’s appointment as the new head coach of the Indian men’s national football team, the All India Football Federation (AIFF) has brought back an Indian at the helm after over a decade. Jamil becomes the first Indian head coach since Savio Medeira in 2011–12 and joins an exclusive list of Indians to have led the national side in the 21st century.Jamil’s appointment was confirmed by the AIFF on Friday following a meeting of the federation's Technical Committee. He was selected from a final shortlist that included former India coach Stephen Constantine and Slovakian manager Stefan Tarkovic. The panel, which included national team director Subrata Paul, emphasised the importance of cultural familiarity and domestic experience, which was the criterion that tilted the decision in Jamil’s favour.His appointment comes after the departure of Spaniard Manolo Márquez, who stepped down last month following a winless year in charge. Márquez had taken over from Igor Štimac, whose five-year term ended after India failed to make significant progress in World Cup qualifying and regional tournaments.Jamil, a former India international midfielder, has earned praise in recent years for his work in the I-League and Indian Super League (ISL), most notably leading Aizawl FC to a historic I-League title in 2017.His ability to extract the best out of domestic talent and his deep understanding of the Indian football ecosystem were key factors in his selection.With the national team set for a period of rebuilding, Jamil's task will be to stabilise performances, integrate the next generation of talent, and lead India into the 2026 AFC Asian Cup qualifiers with a renewed sense of belief.Here’s a list of all national team head coaches in the 21st century:",Khalid Jamil has been appointed as the new head coach of the Indian men’s national football team.

McLaren team principal Ian James pens open letter to fans

What’s next in Formula E?

Team Principal Ian James of the departing Formula E team NEOM McLaren has penned an open letter to the fans of the team, marking their departure from the electric motorsport format. Addressing the Papaya Army, James thanked them for their trust and support as the team went on to win two Drivers’ World Championships and two Teams’ World Championships over 103 races in seven seasons.Ian James began the letter saying that he wrote it with “a huge amount of pride, as well as with more than a hint of sadness,” as the team closed the final chapter after seven years of competing in the ABB FIA Formula E World Championship.Thanking the fans for their love on social media and at the track, he said, “The team was always blown away by the amount of papaya we saw at circuits across the world, race-in, race-out, right from our very first round as the NEOM McLaren Formula E team. Through the early days, the good days, the bad days, and the great days, we have always felt an overwhelming amount of support from you all.”For the partners associated with the team, he wrote, “They say that ‘racing is a state of mind’, and since its inception, this team has had the privilege of working for organisations, with partners, and racing for fans who fully embrace this philosophy.This is certainly true of those at McLaren, whose passion for racing is second to none.”“My heartfelt thanks go out to everyone who has been involved: those at McLaren who backed us, the fans who supported us, and the partners who allowed us to go racing. We couldn’t have done it without you all — your trust and support have never been taken for granted,” he added.Praising the two McLaren drivers, he wrote, “Sam clinched McLaren’s first-ever fully electric win at the São Paulo E-Prix in Season 10, pulling off one of Formula E’s all-time great overtakes, before being waved across the line by none other than Emerson Fittipaldi – McLaren's first Formula 1 World Champion. While Taylor has been a rookie sensation in Season 11, securing five Formula E records, including the youngest driver to start a race, the youngest points scorer, the youngest driver to lead a lap, the youngest podium finisher, and the youngest polesitter. ”He ended the letter saying, “Some of us have been together since the day we first launched this team, while others have seamlessly fitted in along the way and flourished within the environment we have cultivated. For many, I am sure that we will cross paths again soon, but whatever the future holds for those here at Bicester, whatever path they choose to follow, I have no doubt that it will be bright.

How do Formula E and ABB work together?

What do ABB and Formula E say about the partnership?

After a successful Season 11, ABB and Formula E have announced that they will continue their partnership in the upcoming season. This gives ABB another opportunity to promote its new brand positioning via the ABB FIA Formula E World Championship, along with technologies that help industries take a cleaner route.Over a period of eight seasons, the partnership with Formula E has provided ABB a platform to showcase how technology can help industries outrun challenges, engage with customers around the world, and implement its own solutions into the series to improve reliability and efficiency. The partnership extension will provide a year-round opportunity for brand-building and activation, communicating ABB and its technology solutions to new global audiences, including Formula E’s international fanbase.ABB and Formula E will also join hands to engage a new generation of fans, collaborating with unexpected influencers and content creators to tell compelling stories that make advanced electrification and automation technologies tangible and exciting.The end of the mid-race car swap, a 150kW increase in power, top speeds that are 43 percent higher, and energy recovery increasing from 15 to 50 percent indicate how far Formula E technology has come to outperform on track.ABB has also built on its technical involvement in the series, supplying the race chargers from Season 9, and introducing its ABB Ability OPTIMAX® energy management software (Season 9) and Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) technology (Season 5) to the sport.ABB Head of Brand Paco Liebrand said, “We are pleased to be continuing our partnership with Formula E which, like ABB, is striving for a leaner and cleaner future. The synergy between the two organizations, combined with the global appeal of the Championship, makes it a great platform to promote our brand positioning.”He further said, “Formula E is increasingly working with content creators, influencers, and celebrities, with initiatives such as the Evo Sessions making an impact through digital channels beyond the racing itself, which is also an essential part of ABB’s new brand strategy. Going forward, we will be enhancing the way we harness the benefits of this collaboration, ensuring the focus is on delivering content and activations that reinforce our new messaging, build familiarity, and tell the ‘Engineered to Outrun’ story. ”Formula E Chief Revenue Officer Tiziana Di Gioia said, “Our renewed partnership with ABB is a testament to the commercial power and benefit of Formula E as a global platform that drives both brand and business growth. ABB, like our wider partnership portfolio, has and continues to see enormous value in collaborating with the fastest-growing motorsport on the planet, with viewership, commercial integration, and brand storytelling continuing to accelerate. Over eight seasons, ABB has moved from brand visibility to brand activation—integrating deeply into the fan experience, the sport’s ecosystem, and our innovation narrative.Also Read: Antonio Felix Da Costa shares happy memories as Porsche wins Formula E Teams and Manufacturers’ World Championships “This next chapter elevates the partnership even further. With ABB’s new positioning, we are co-creating opportunities across content, digital storytelling, and market engagement, transforming a title partnership into a year-round, value-generating relationship. It’s a model of how modern sponsorships should evolve, rooted in purpose and cultural alignment but measured by impact,” she added.Formula E Season 12 will begin with testing in Valencia in October.","ABB and Formula E have announced that they will continue their partnership in the upcoming season.

Nick Cassidy takes third spot in Driver Standings

N ick Cassidy seems to have all the luck on his side as he went on to win his third race of the season, just days after announcing his exit from Jaguar TCS Racing at the end of this season. The New Zealander won the London E-Prix Round 15 race at the ExCeL Arena on Saturday. He himself called the win “unbelievable,” which was also witnessed by his grandmother at the circuit. Not only that, he also secured a front-row start for the Round 16 race on Sunday.Nick Cassidy himself was in disbelief over his third win and said, “It’s unbelievable! To win here at home for Jaguar and our team, in front of a lot of our friends, family, and partners who are here today, is incredible.”Talking about their strategy and the car, he said, “I wasn’t the happiest guy this morning, but that was for a reason, and I knew we had good potential in the car. In that race, I was able to show that, which is pretty cool.To be honest, it was a little bit fluid — a huge shoutout to my strategy team. I was really scared about not coming out of the pits after Pit Boost in the lead of that second group, and it was tight, but I was able to hang on there, and that’s what made the race.It meant that we could do the Attack Modes later, which was really powerful.”Nick Cassidy also shared a video montage of his podium celebration, where he sprayed champagne and celebrated with his team and family. He wrote, “Parked it in Victory Lane in London! That was incredibly special and will take a while to sink in. One more race today to finish off the season @jaguarracing.”The official social media pages of Formula E also shared a video featuring Cassidy’s grandmother, who witnessed his victory at the London E-Prix. It was shared with the caption: “Seeing your grandson on top of the podium @NickCassidy's Grandma was in London to witness the special moment.”Nick Cassidy was able to successfully counter Nyck de Vries' early Attack Mode and late Pit Boost strategy to surpass him with his eyes on the finish line. The Jaguar driver started fifth on the grid and helped the team follow up their double win in Berlin with a third consecutive victory — only the fifth team in Formula E history to achieve that feat.Also Read: London E-Prix Round 15 results: Nick Cassidy wins 3rd race of season 11, climbs into top three in Driver Standings The win also propelled Cassidy into the top three in the Formula E Driver Standings with 127 points.

London E‑Prix Season So Far: Key Moments from Formula E Season 11

Hits and Misses at the London E-Prix

It was Jaguar TCS Racing’s day at the London E-Prix on Saturday. Fresh off his Berlin win, Mitch Evans started from pole but spun during the race and lost his lead. It was eventually his teammate Nick Cassidy who went on to win Round 15. The victory was even more special for Cassidy, who had announced that he would be leaving the team after the season wraps up on Sunday. He also pushed Taylor Barnard to fourth by taking the third place in the Formula E Driver Standings.In a message to Jaguar TCS Racing after clinching his third win of the season, Nick Cassidy said, “I take back every single little thing I said about strategy today because I got it completely wrong, and you guys got it completely right. It’s an honour to drive for you. Thank you so much. That one was for you guys.”Cassidy was followed by Mahindra Racing’s Nyck de Vries, who secured second place on the podium — his second of the season. He had started from the front row and managed to hold his ground. TAG Heuer Porsche’s Pascal Wehrlein finished third, adding another podium to his season. He currently sits second in the Formula E Drivers’ Standings behind championship leader Oliver Rowland.Maserati MSG Racing’s Stoffel Vandoorne finished fourth, followed by Andretti’s Jake Dennis in fifth. DS Penske’s Jean-Eric Vergne came in sixth, while Mahindra Racing’s Edoardo Mortara secured seventh. Envision Racing’s Robin Frijns was eighth, Nissan’s Norman Nato ninth, and Mitch Evans — despite starting on pole — ended in 10th after his spin. Championship leader Rowland finished 11th.The race saw early drama when DS Penske’s Maximilian Günther hit the wall right after the start, triggering a pile-up that also involved McLaren’s Taylor Barnard and Sam Bird, as well as Lola Yamaha ABT’s Zane Maloney.Near the finish line, Cupra Kiro’s Dan Ticktum also crashed into the wall and retired from the race. Earlier, Ticktum had made contact with Mitch Evans’ Jaguar, causing Evans to spin and lose his lead — ultimately finishing 10th.Also Read: Nick Cassidy to bid farewell to Jaguar TCS Racing after London E-Prix: “It’s been an incredible two years together” The London E-Prix Round 16 race will take place on Sunday at the same time.

Kush Maini is a pro when it comes to cricket knowledge

Who is Kush Maini?

Mahindra Racing’s Indian Formula 2 champion Kush Maini is not just an impressive presence on the track but also well-versed in his country’s favourite sport — cricket. The racer from Bengaluru recently took a cricket quiz and nearly scored a perfect 10/10, answering almost every question with precision. He is the only Indian to have won a Formula 2 race in Monaco and recently delivered an impressive performance at the Berlin Rookie Test, finishing among the top three in both sessions.A video of Kush Maini’s cricket quiz shows him getting momentarily confused with the first question, though he gave the correct answer initially. When asked about the number of players in a cricket team, he initially said “eleven” but changed it to “twelve” after counting the number of openers and following players.After that brief hiccup, Maini breezed through the quiz like a pro. He correctly answered questions about the criteria for a four and a six, and explained terms like LBW, duck, and clean bowled. He also knew the number of overs bowled in T20, One-Day, and Test matches.When asked which team Virat Kohli represents in the IPL, Maini confidently replied, “RCB… that’s me, can’t get that wrong.” He also tackled a question about the British singer who joked about not understanding cricket despite coming from the country that invented it.Maini answered “Ed Sheeran” — and was pleasantly surprised to learn he was right. He also knew that David Beckham was the English footballer who once played a friendly match with Sachin Tendulkar.Watch Kush Maini’s candid video here Kush Maini moved to England at the age of 13–14 to pursue racing. Originally from Bengaluru, he now spends more time abroad than in India. He became the first Indian to win the prestigious Monaco Grand Prix in Formula 2 earlier this year.He recently showcased his racing talent during the Berlin Rookie Test, representing Mahindra Racing. He finished second in the morning session and third in the afternoon. Speaking after the test, he said, “In the morning, we focused on 350kW runs, and in the afternoon, more on race runs. Whatever the run, we were always in the top three and really fast, so a good step was made. Whenever I get into this car, I leave with a smile on my face. ”Also Read: Berlin Rookie Test standouts Gabriele Minì and Kush Maini share insights after impressive runs Maini continues to shine on the track and, following his impressive performance in Berlin, may even join Formula E one day.","Kush Maini is the only Indian to have won a Formula 2 race in Monaco.

Toronto:

'You have to compete'

Anastasija Sevastova stunned two-time defending champion Jessica Pegula 3-6, 6-4, 6-1 on Friday to book a fourth-round clash with Naomi Osaka at the WTA Canadian Open.Sevastova, a former world No. 11 now ranked 386th, snapped fourth-ranked Pegula's 11-match WTA Canada win streak, the longest since Serena Williams reeled off 14 consecutive wins in 2011, 2013 and 2014.She will try to extend her Montreal run in a round of 16 meeting with Osaka, a four-time Grand Slam champion from Japan who ousted another Latvian, 22nd seed Jelena Ostapenko, 6-2, 6-4.""Somehow, I was down 2-0 in the second set and started to play better and better,"" Sevastova said. ""Third set I played really good.""Just trying to stay on the court as long as possible,"" added Sevastova, who has dealt with injury since returning from maternity leave in February 2024.In the night session, second-seeded Iga Swiatek -- playing her first tournament since winning Wimbledon -- raced into the fourth round with a 6-2, 6-2 victory over Germany's Eva Lys.Swiatek next faces Denmark's Clara Tauson, who beat Yuliia Starodubtseva 6-3, 6-0.Pegula, last year's US Open runner-up in her best Slam showing, was the first woman to win back to back Canadian Open titles since Martina Hingis in 1999-2000.But she has struggled in recent months, dropping her openers at Wimbledon and at Washington last week.The American broke to open the match and again at love to claim the first set.But she couldn't maintain an early break in the second, with Sevastova breaking for a 5-4 lead and denying Pegula on three break chances before holding in the final game to force a third set in which she seized a 4-1 lead on the way to victory.""It was a weird match for me,"" Pegula said. ""I felt like I had total control and then I just played a couple of terrible games for, like, three games.""That totally flipped the momentum of the match, and I went from being up a set and 2-0 to being down very quickly.""I don't really feel like I'm playing great tennis,"" Pegula admitted. ""At times I am, but I feel very up and down, kind of sloppy, which I don't like. I've got to figure it out.""Osaka, twice a winner at both the US and Australian Opens, is one match away from her first quarter-final run at either a Grand Slam or WTA 1000 event since she returned from maternity leave at the start of 2024.Now ranked 49th, Osaka broke on a double fault to capture the first set in 30 minutes and raced to a 3-1 lead in the second.They exchanged breaks before Osaka served for the match with a 5-3 lead, but Ostapenko saved a match point on a forehand crosscourt winner and broke when Osaka sent a forehand beyond the baseline.The Japanese star responded by breaking Ostapenko at love in the final game.""I went in there knowing she's a great player and if I give her a chance she's going to hit a winner on me, so I just tried to keep my pace and stay as solid as I could,"" Osaka said.Australian Open champion Madison Keys, seeded sixth, beat fellow American Caty McNally 2-6, 6-3, 6-3 and will next meet Karolina Muchova, a 6-7 (2/7), 6-2, 6-3 winner over Belinda Bencic.Fifth-seeded American Amanda Anisimova, regrouping this week after a crushing 6-0, 6-0 loss to Swiatek in the Wimbledon final, swept past Britain's Emma Raducanu 6-2, 6-1.She lined up a meeting with Ukrainian Elina Svitolina, who beat Russian Anna Kalinskaya 6-1, 6-1.Taylor Fritz ended Canadian hopes at the ATP Toronto Masters on Friday as he crushed Gabriel Diallo 6-4, 6-2 to advance to the fourth round.The American second seed needed just 77 minutes to dispatch the the 37th-ranked local and book a meeting with Jiri Lehecka, a 3-6, 6-3, 6-4 winner over France's Arthur Fils.Fritz is aiming to at least reach the quarter-finals north of the border, the only Masters where he has not gone that far.He broke once in the opening set against a nervous opponent and dominated from there.""It was important not to let him get into the match and get the crowd fired up,"" Fritz said. ""I knew the momentum could shift at any time.""I'm super happy with it, considering how I felt on the court two nights ago in my first match,"" Fritz added.""I felt way more comfortable, confident, just hitting the ball, being aggressive, just striking it. I did well to be up an early break in the sets. I did well to just hold.""Played really solid from the baseline as well. I backed it up well from the ground, and just did a good job of not letting him back in the sets.""Brandon Nakashima won his first set against American Ben Shelton before the fourth-seeded Shelton rallied to finish off a 6-7 (8/10), 6-2, 7-6 (7/5) win.Shelton had trailed by a break in the deciding set and Nakashima saved four match points before Shelton sealed the victory with his 19th ace.Shelton finished with 46 winners to improve to 5-0 against Nakashima and will fight for a quarter-final berth against Flavio Cobolli, who downed Fabian Marozsan 6-2, 4-6, 6-3.""I've got to find my fire from somewhere,"" Shelton said of the late-night crowd support in Canada. ""I live off of that.""Night matches are never easy, the temperature cools down and conditions are different. I showed a lot of perseverance. it's difficult being down against a big server. To come from behind takes a bit of luck.""The seeded pair of Andrey Rublev and Frances Tiafoe were tested over three sets before also making their way into the fourth round.Sixth seed Rublev, runner-up in Canada a year ago to Alexei Popyrin, advanced 5-7, 6-4, 6-3 as Lorenzo Sonego double-faulted on match point in their contest.Tiafoe, the number seven, confessed to a bad day but earned his win the hard way as he beat Australian Aleksandar Vukic 6-3, 4-6, 6-3.""The ball was flying a lot, it was really ugly, but I'm happy to get through it,"" Tiafoe said. ""It doesn't matter how you win. You just have to compete.""Tiafoe next lines up against another Aussie in Alex de Minaur, who advanced when compatriot Christopher O'Connell pulled out with an injury.Rublev now goes against Alejandro Davidovich Fokina, who beat him this season on clay in Barcelona. The Spaniard beat Jakob Mensik 6-2, 6-4.""I'm really happy, it's my first time in the round of 16 here in Toronto,"" Rublev said, adding that he had to adjust his serve in windy conditions to fashion his comeback.""I played more aggressive in the second set and made fewer mistakes. I was doing more with my serve. I had to slow it wide in the wind.""","Anastasija Sevastova stuns two-time defending champion Jessica Pegula 3-6, 6-4,. 6-1 on Friday to book a fourth-round clash with Naomi Osaka.

Toronto:

Wimbledon champion Iga Swiatek cruised, Naomi Osaka battled through and Canadian Eugenie Bouchard called time on her WTA career with a gutsy second-round loss in Montreal on Wednesday.Switzerland's Belinda Bencic sent Bouchard into retirement with a 6-2, 3-6, 6-4 victory -- but not before the Canadian thrilled her hometown fans by seizing an early break in the third set.Spectators were on their feet, trying to will Bouchard to another victory on the heels of her first-round triumph on Monday -- her first WTA win since 2023.But Bencic won five of the last six games to vanquish Bouchard, who had announced earlier in July she would retire after a final appearance in her home tournament.""I think it's so special to play my last match here in Montreal on this court in front of you guys,"" a teary Bouchard said as she was honoured on court after the match.""I remember being a little kid sitting in these stands, hoping and dreaming that I would play on this court one day.""I grew up playing on these courts, and courts all around Montreal and near here, so it feels like such a full circle moment to finish my career here.""Bouchard, who rose as high as fifth in the world rankings, shot to prominence in 2014 when she reached the Wimbledon final and made semi-final runs at the Australian and French Opens.But her career was hindered by injuries, including a concussion suffered in a locker room slip at the 2015 US Open and a shoulder injury that required surgery in 2021.There was no drama for Poland's Swiatek, who breezed past Chinese qualifier Guo Hanyu 6-3, 6-1 in her first match since her crushing victory over Amanda Anisimova in the Wimbledon final.Swiatek, seeded second, broke Guo's serve six times to book her spot in the third round.It was much harder going for Japan's four-time Grand Slam champion Osaka, who saved two match points in a 4-6, 7-6 (8/6) 6-3 triumph over Liudmila Samsonova.Osaka, now working with Tomasz Wiktorowski after announcing on Monday she had split with coach Patrick Mouratoglou, surrendered early breaks in each of the first two sets.Wimbledon quarter-finalist Samsonova served for the match at 5-4 in the second and led 40-15. The Russian fired a forehand long on her first match point and on her second a lackluster drop shot effort gave Osaka an opening and the Japanese star pounced.Samsonova's double fault on break point allowed Osaka to level the set, and after storming back from 5-2 down in the tiebreaker to force a third set Osaka took control early, breaking Samsonova twice on the way to a 4-1 lead.""She definitely came out really hard and, for me, I was definitely overwhelmed and I didn't know if I should also be hitting winners,"" Osaka said. ""After a while I just tried to keep the ball in court.""Jessica Pegula, the two-time defending champion and third seed, saved five set points in the opening set on the way to a 7-5, 6-4 victory over Maria Sakkari of Greece.Australian Open champion Madison Keys, the sixth seed, opened her campaign with a 6-2, 6-1 victory over Laura Siegemund, avenging a third-round loss to the German at Wimbledon.Second-seeded Taylor Fritz struggled with three rain delays and a stubborn Spanish opponent on Wednesday, pulling out a tight 7-5, 7-6 (7/1) win over Roberto Carballes Baena at the ATP Toronto Masters.The second-round match was halted repeatedly by light rain, with the final 18-minute pause coming just as the second-set tiebreaker was about to start.But Fritz, winner of Stuttgart and Eastbourne titles this season, quickly sprinted to victory before heavier rains were expected to set in.The American was far from pleased with a win which was marred by 45 unforced errors and confessed that he has not yet felt on his game in Canada.""Even in practice I'm having a hard time putting the ball into the court,"" he said. ""But I'm happy to get through this one.""Everything is not feeling great, it's tough to control the ball.""Since I've been here it's been absolutely brutal. But I have another match to figure it out and hopefully I can play myself into the tournament.""Fritz's fourth-seeded compatriot Ben Shelton had no complaints after earning his first career win over gritty Frenchman Adrian Mannarino 6-2, 6-3.Shelton had dropped two prior meetings with 37-year-old qualifier Mannarino but said he was able to vary his serve to get over the line this time.""This win was huge for me. He's a shotmaker, he can take the racquet out of your hands,"" Shelton said. ""I've played well against him in the past and come up short, he can make things really difficult.""- Tiafoe hangs on -American Frances Tiafoe squeezed out a win after more than two and a quarter hours against Japan's Yosuke Watanuki, hailing his opponent's fighting spirit after a 1-6, 7-5, 7-6 (7/5) triumph.""He can hit a winner on any shot,"" Tiafoe said. ""I needed some luck in those last two sets to win.""Tiafoe managed just 19 winners to the 45 of his 158th-ranked foe, but now lines up against Australian Alexsandar Vukic, who defeated Briton Cam Norrie 6-3, 6-7 (2/7), 6-3.Andrey Rublev, runner-up in Canada a year ago to Alexei Popyrin, won his 250th career match on hardcourt as he beat France's Hugo Gaston 6-2, 6-3.The sixth seed needed four match points to advance after 86 minutes and now plays Italian Lorenzo Sonego, a 6-1, 6-4 winner over China's Bu Yunchaokete.Wimbledon quarter-finalist Flavio Cobolli of Italy delivered four aces in the final game of a rain-interrupted match to clinch a 6-4, 5-7, 6-4 victory over Canadian Alexis Galarneau.But Canadian Gabriel Diallo came out on top against his Italian opponent, beating Matteo Gigante 6-3, 7-6 (7/5) to next face Fritz.Montreal's Felix Auger-Aliassime suffered another early disappointment, losing his opening match in his home Masters for a third straight year as he fell to Fabian Marozsan 6-4, 6-4.Former top 10 ranking regular Stefanos Tsitsipas, now 30th in the world, continued a downward slide with a 6-4. 4-6, 6-2 loss to Australian Christopher O'Connell.Alex de Minaur, winner in Washington on Sunday, defeated Francisco Comesana 6-4, 6-2.""It was not pretty by any means,"" Australia's de Minaur said. ""The wind and rain made it quite tough. I'm happy I was engaged and focused from the first point to the last.""Backing up a good week is the toughest ask in tennis. You don't have a lot of time to enjoy the moment after a week of emotional highs.""You have to find a way to re-set and do it all over again.""","Wimbledon champion Iga Swiatek cruised, Naomi Osaka battled through.

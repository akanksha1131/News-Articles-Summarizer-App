Poll Do you believe that reducing player wages is a viable solution for clubs in the Indian Super League (ISL)? Yes, it's necessary to adapt to lower revenues No, it could lead to legal issues Maybe, depending on individual club circumstances

All 14 first division clubs have confirmed their intention to play the much-delayed 2025-26 season of the Indian Super League (ISL) on Monday. Some clubs have been clear that they want to get the ball rolling while others have sought clarity on finances from the All India Football Federation (AIFF).On January 6, all clubs had verbally agreed to play the truncated league, although at least six had asked for conditional support to go ahead. The clubs wanted a complete waiver of Rs 1 crore participation fee and government support in reduced costs to host games.""We are standing our ground saying, 'Yes we will participate as we committed to the government. But we need more clarity from you, from the AIFF,"" said a club official to TimesofIndia.com.""Easier way to say it is that our participation is confirmed (in the ISL), if certain conditions are met,"" added the official before clarifying that they need commitments to be made over the financial aspects of the league.As the deadline to confirm their home venues came on Monday, all clubs confirmed their participation to the AIFF, including Odisha FC who had sought further time to deliberate.Odisha FC had suspended first team operations in August 2025, and pulled out of Durand Cup and Super Cup.They had sought a long-term financial roadmap before committing to play.The objective for clubs will now be on cutting costs. With 91 games to be played in the season in a single-leg home and away format, ISL will begin on February 14 and would end before May 31.Of the Rs 24.26 crore budget allocated for the 2025-26 season, the clubs will foot Rs 1 crore each as participation fee, AIFF will contribute Rs 9.77 crore and the remaining expenses will be come from federation's resources on an ongoing basis.As a result, the clubs will pay the participation fee, the logistics, for the venues, player wages among other things. The returns, in comparison to previous years, will be lower with broadcast revenue alone amounting to Rs 275 crore per season - something that won't be as substantial this time.""Which is why we've all questioned the participation fee and said that ideally it should be lesser if not charged at all. But I think it's also a new model that everyone's trying to work out and experiment, right?,"" reasoned an ISL club official.One significant outlay for ISL clubs over the years has been on salaries. One player agent confirmed that some clubs have reached out to players and asked them to take a pay cut now that the revenues will be lower.The agent explained that the clubs cannot force pay cuts on players since they are contract bound. If a club does look to force their way, a player can take the legal route. In case the players do accept the proposals of reduced wages, a new contract will be drawn.At this stage, not every ISL club is looking at reduced player wages as first option. With season shortened, logistical costs will be reduced and resources will be utilised differently to prepare home venues.""There were certain standards which were set by the ISL. There were certain norms that we used to follow, there were certain criteria's which we used to follow, certain kind of basic parameters. It could be a difference of almost 20 to 30 percent in cost, resource management type, resource utilization (now),"" said another ISL club official who wished to not be named.""So that would obviously ... we'll try to see where we can curtail without compromising on any kind of safety or any of those things. But yeah, maybe the glamour quotient will come down,"" he added.Some clubs are okay to bite the bullet to get the league underway in the first place. Newly promoted Inter Kashi are one who have agreed to play all their games on the road since their home stadium in Varanasi would only be operational around Diwali.""I think the most important part is that in our country, since the last 6 months, football had come to a stop. Now, football is going to start. And there will be football. Let us focus on the football,"" said Prithijit Das, President of Inter Kashi.""What is the production cost, who is the sponsor, what difference does it make? If you play a game, that game is starting, that is the biggest thing. At the end of the season, we can have a discussion on what was bad, what was good. But first, there should be a season. We were thinking there won't be a season at all,"" he added.His views were echoed by another club chief who were one of the firsts to confirm participation in the 2025-26 ISL.""Our biggest (goal) was that football should happen. We were anyway not making profits and this was not going to make you profitable anyway. If there is a gap year, Indian football will go to the dogs! All the effort that you've put in so far, would have gone for a toss.""Today it is more about being alive than sustainability in time to come. Going by the circumstances, we were more for football and that's what we were pushing for.""The immediate next steps for AIFF will be finalising a shortened calendar, getting an exemption from AFC related to ACL 2 slot and finding commercial and broadcast partners.","14 first division clubs have confirmed their intention to play the much-delayed 2025-26 season of the Indian Super League (ISL) On Monday, all clubs confirmed their participation to the All India Football Federation (AIFF) The objective for clubs will now be on cutting costs.

Why India need leader Shreyas Iyer for 2027 World Cup | Greenstone Lobo prediction

VADODARA: Virat Kohli slammed a majestic 93 (91b, 8x4, 1x6), but after suffering a collapse, India found their heroes in Harshit Rana 29 (23b, 2x4, 1x6) and KL Rahul 29* (21b, 2x4, 1x6) to huff and puff their way to a thrilling four-wicket win in the first ODI against a spirited New Zealand at the BCA Stadium on Sunday night. The hosts have taken a 1-0 lead in the three-match series.Walking out bravely to bat despite suffering a side strain that must worry India ahead of the T20 World Cup next month, Washington Sundar (7 not out off 7 balls) added 27* in 16 balls with Rahul for the seventh wicket to ensure India head to Rajkot for the second ODI on Jan 14 with a leg up. Showing off his fabulous finishing skills once again, Rahul aced the tense chase with two fours—a scoop followed by a booming cover drive—followed by a match-sealing six to deep mid-wicket off debutant Kiwi pacer Kristian Clarke off the last ball of the 49th over, triggering the 30,000-packed crowd here into celebrations.Credit must be given to Rana too for taking pressure off Rahul by striking some lusty blows in their crucial 37-run stand for the sixth wicket.Losing their composure in the tense moments, the Black Caps uncharacteristically dropped catches to let off Rana (Daryl Mitchell at long on) and Sundar (Adithya Ashok at short fine-leg), to let India sneak through.Fired by Kohli’s regal show, India seemed to be cruising while chasing 301, placed at 234 for 2 in the 40th over, before suffering a stunning collapse as tall pacer Kyle Jamieson took a career-best 4 for 41 to wreck their innings.Jamieson took the big wickets of Rohit Sharma (26, 29b, 3x4, 2x6), Kohli, Shreyas Iyer (47, 41b, 4x4, 1x6) and Ravindra Jadeja (4) to jolt India.Unleashing some exquisite strokes, Kohli put on 118 in 107 balls for the second wicket with captain Shubman Gill (56, 71b, 3x4, 2x6), and then 77 in 76 balls for the third wicket with Iyer. The trio took a heavy toll of Black Caps leggie Ashok (1-55 in six overs)Coming back into the side after being out for three months due to a spleen injury, Iyer enjoyed a fine outing, and effected a run-out to send Bracewell back after sprinting in from long-on and firing in a brilliant direct hit to catch Bracewell short.Earlier, continuing his fondness for feasting on India’s bowling attacks, Daryl Mitchell smashed a sublime 84 off 71 balls, in an innings studded with five fours and three sixes, to take New Zealand to 300 for 8, after they looked like finishing with much less following a middle-order collapse.The 34-year-old Mitchell, who stroked two magnificent centuries— both in a losing cause—against India in the 2023 ODI World Cup in India, showed exactly why he is the world’s No 3 ranked batter in ODIs behind India superstars Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma. Asked to bat first by India, the Kiwis received a perfect start when their openers Devon Conway (56 off 67 balls; 6 fours, 1 six) and Henry Nicholls (62 off 69 balls; 8 fours) put on a 117-run stand in 130 balls. However, the Black Caps lost their way to slide to 239 for 7 in the 44th over, as India fought back through pacer Harshit Rana’s second spell, which saw him take two wickets in two overs.","India beat New Zealand by four wickets to take 1-0 lead in three-match series.

Brief Scores

Pretoria Capitals:

MI Cape Town:

Pretoria Capitals surged to the top of the SA20 standings after producing a ruthless all-round display to hand MI Cape Town a 53-run defeat at a sold-out Centurion on Monday night.The bonus-point win lifted the Capitals to 20 points, moving them above defending champions Sunrisers Eastern Cape, while MI Cape Town’s playoff hopes were left hanging by a thread with only two matches remaining — both against Sunrisers.After being put under pressure early, the Capitals were rescued by a blazing innings from Sherfane Rutherford, whose 53 off 27 balls transformed a shaky position into a commanding total of 185 for 6. Walking in at 89 for 4 with just over seven overs remaining, the West Indies power-hitter launched a counter-attack that completely flipped the momentum.Rutherford found an ideal ally in Dewald Brevis, and the pair added a furious 69 off just 34 balls for the fifth wicket. MI Cape Town were made to pay for sloppy fielding, with both batters dropped off consecutive Corbin Bosch deliveries, errors that proved costly.Brevis then lit up Centurion with two audacious sixes off Kagiso Rabada — one a no-look flick over fine leg and the other a one-handed swipe over cover — while Rutherford punished Trent Boult for 16 runs in a single over.When Rutherford fell off the final ball of the innings, caught at long-on, the damage had already been done.The Capitals carried that momentum straight into the field. Gideon Peters delivered a decisive blow by ripping through MI Cape Town’s middle order with a sensational double-wicket maiden. His spell triggered a dramatic collapse as the visitors slumped from 46 for 2 to 55 for 6, losing four wickets for just 11 runs.Brevis then turned the match on its head with two breathtaking boundary-line catches, showcasing agility and awareness that matched his batting flair.Despite a lone resistance from Reeza Hendricks , who struck an unbeaten 68 from 50 balls, MI Cape Town never recovered and were restricted to 132 for 7.With this emphatic victory, the Capitals now head into their remaining fixtures — against Paarl Royals at home and Joburg Super Kings away — brimming with confidence as they chase a direct path to the SA20 playoffs.185 for 6 in 20 overs (Sherfane Rutherford 53, Dewald Brevis 34; Kagiso Rabada 2-33)132 for 7 in 20 overs (Reza Hendricks 68; Gideon Peters 3-32)",Pretoria Capitals beat MI Cape Town by 53 runs to go top of SA20 standings.

NEW DELHI: Defending champions Karnataka advanced to the semifinals of the Vijay Hazare Trophy for the fourth season in a row after beating Mumbai by 55 runs via the VJD method on Monday.Chasing a target of 255, Karnataka were 187 for 1 in 33 overs when rain stopped play at the BCCI Centre of Excellence Ground 1 in Bengaluru. At that stage, the VJD par score was 132, with Karnataka well ahead. Devdutt Padikkal was unbeaten on 81 off 95 balls, while Karun Nair was not out on 74 from 80 deliveries.Earlier, Mumbai were restricted to 254 for 8 after Karnataka captain Mayank Agarwal chose to bowl. Mumbai were already without pacer Tushar Deshpande due to personal reasons, and suffered another setback when Sarfaraz Khan was ruled out after injuring his finger during net practice.Mumbai struggled early and slipped to 60 for 4 in 17.2 overs. Shams Mulani held the innings together with 86 off 91 balls, hitting eight boundaries. He added 76 runs for the sixth wicket with captain Siddhesh Lad, who scored 38 off 58 balls.After Lad was dismissed, Mumbai lost two quick wickets, but Mulani continued to anchor the innings. He reached his half-century off 68 balls and accelerated later with support from Sairaj Patil, who scored 33 not out off 25 balls.The pair helped Mumbai add 59 runs in the final five overs. Mulani was dismissed lbw by Abhilash Shetty in the final over.For Karnataka, Vidyadhar Patil picked up three wickets for 42 runs, while Abhilash Shetty and Vidwath Kaverappa claimed two wickets each.In the chase, Agarwal and Padikkal started cautiously before Karnataka lost their captain in the powerplay. Agarwal edged Mohit Avasthi to slip for 12 off 24 balls. Mumbai then missed two chances to dismiss Padikkal. On 24, he was dropped by Onkar Tarmale at deep fine leg, and later survived another chance at first slip.Padikkal made Mumbai pay and increased the scoring rate, hitting boundaries through the leg side. He and Nair added 143 runs for the second wicket in 150 balls.Nair returned to form with a half-century off 44 balls, his third fifty of the tournament and 16th in List A cricket. Mumbai used seven bowlers, but apart from Avasthi’s early wicket, none could make further breakthroughs.Karnataka had earlier topped Elite Group A with six wins from seven matches and continued their strong run with this victory.","Defending champions Karnataka advance to semifinals of Vijay Hazare Trophy.

Allan Donald on Virat Kohli’s legacy: Can he reach 100 centuries?

Royal Challengers Bengaluru produced a one-sided show in Navi Mumbai as an explosive opening stand between Grace Harris and Smriti Mandhana sealed a nine-wicket win over UP Warriorz in the Women’s Premier League on Monday.Asked to bat first, UP Warriorz were rocked early by disciplined bowling from RCB and slumped to 50 for 5 inside nine overs. The innings was rescued by a calm and increasingly aggressive sixth-wicket partnership between Deepti Sharma and Deandra Dottin. After steadying things initially, the pair lifted the tempo late, adding 93 runs together to take UPW to 143 for 5. Deepti finished unbeaten on 45 off 35 balls, striking five fours and a six, while Dottin supported her with an unbeaten 40 off 37 deliveries. Nadine de Klerk and Shreyanka Patil picked up two wickets apiece, while Lauren Bell impressed again with figures of 1 for 16 from four overs.RCB’s reply was brutal. Harris set the tone straightaway, taking on Deepti Sharma in the opening over and never easing up. Alongside her, Mandhana rotated strike smoothly and punished anything loose. The turning point came in the final over of the powerplay, when Harris dismantled Deandra Dottin for 32 runs, an over that featured three sixes, four boundaries, a no-ball and a wide. Harris brought up a 22-ball fifty as RCB stormed to 78 without loss at the end of six overs, a phase that effectively ended the contest.RCB crossed 100 in just 7.5 overs and were 121 without loss at the halfway mark. The 137-run opening stand ended when Harris was caught by Meg Lanning for a stunning 85 off 40 balls, which included ten fours and five sixes. By then, the target was all but done. Mandhana remained unbeaten on 47, with Richa Ghosh alongside her, as RCB completed the chase in 12.1 overs to register a second straight win, while UP Warriorz slipped to their second successive defeat.Brief scores: UP Warriorz 143/5 in 20 overs lost to Royal Challengers Bengaluru 145/1 in 12.1 overs.",Royal Challengers Bengaluru beat UP Warriorz by nine wickets.

Bangladesh seek T20 WC match shift from India after Mustafizur Rahman's IPL exit

NEW DELHI: Sources within the International Cricket Council (ICC) have denied claims that security concerns could prevent the Bangladesh men’s team from travelling to India for the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup 2026, clarifying that the cricket board's risk assessments do not support such a conclusion.The clarification comes after Azif Nazrul, Bangladesh’s sports advisor, told reporters on Monday that the ICC’s security team had validated Dhaka’s concerns and warned of heightened risks for Bangladeshi players and supporters in India.Nazrul claimed the ICC had flagged increased security threats if star left-arm seamer Mustafizur Rahman was included in the squad, if fans wore Bangladesh jerseys in public, and if the tournament coincided with Bangladesh’s upcoming national elections.Nazrul went further, arguing that these purported observations made it “unrealistic and unreasonable” for Bangladesh to participate in a World Cup hosted in India.In a detailed statement on Monday evening, however, an ICC source rejected that interpretation, saying some public comments had selectively referenced its security risk assessment and misrepresented routine contingency planning as concrete threats.“The ICC’s independent risk assessments, carried out by internationally recognised security experts, do not conclude that Bangladesh cannot play its scheduled matches in India,” said the source in the ICC. It added that the overall security risk for the tournament had been assessed as “low to moderate”, consistent with many major global sporting events.The source further clarified, no specific or direct threat has been identified to the Bangladesh team, officials or match venues. The risk associated with Bangladesh’s scheduled fixtures in Kolkata and Mumbai has also been assessed as low to moderate, with no indication of dangers that cannot be effectively managed through standard security planning.""The ICC wishes to be clear that it has never suggested, nor would it suggest, that any team should select or exclude players for security reasons, that supporters should be restricted from wearing national colours, or that domestic democratic processes be altered in order to participate in an ICC event,"" the source explained.Tensions around Bangladesh’s participation escalated earlier this month after reports that the Bangladesh men’s team had decided not to travel to India for the 2026 tournament, citing safety concerns. The Bangladesh Cricket Board subsequently confirmed it had formally written to the ICC outlining its position, arguing that prevailing security issues made participation unfeasible if the event were held in India.The backdrop to the dispute also includes recent friction involving Mustafizur Rahman’s release from Kolkata Knight Riders squad ahead of the Indian Premier League 2026 season.Bangladesh are due to play three matches in India during the T20 World Cup, at the Eden Gardens in Kolkata and one match at Mumbai's Wankhede Stadium. They are scheduled to take on West Indies, Italy and England on February 7, 9 and 14, respectively.

Bangladesh sports advisor Asif Nazrul on Monday claimed that the International Cricket Council (ICC) has acknowledged Bangladesh’s security concerns about travelling to India for the T20 World Cup.Bangladesh have expressed reservations about touring India for the T20 World Cup, which is scheduled to begin on February 7. The team has requested that its matches be moved to co-host Sri Lanka, citing security concerns. This came after Bangladesh pacer Mustafizur Rahman was released by IPL franchise Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) following instructions from the BCCI, which cited unspecified ""developments"" for the decision.""I need to inform you that the security team of the ICC and those in charge of security have sent a letter (to BCB). In that letter, it has been said that three things will increase the security threat to the Bangladesh team,"" Nazrul said at a press conference in Dhaka, as quoted by local newspaper Daily Star.""One is if Mustafizur (Rahman) is included in the Bangladesh team. Two, if the supporters of the Bangladesh team walk around wearing the national jersey of Bangladesh.And the third is that the security threat of the Bangladesh team will increase as the (Bangladesh) elections approach,"" he added.The ICC, while confirming that it has been in touch with the Bangladesh Cricket Board, denied Nazrul’s claim that it accepted Bangladesh’s concerns in the manner described.""There has been an internal communication from ICC to BCB with regards to security in India. But what Asif Nazrul said is a complete lie. ICC's communication never mentions that Mustafizur's selection will be an issue. It's complete falsehood...There is no such advisory in formal communication,” an ICC source was quoted as saying by news agency PTI.The T20 World Cup is scheduled to be held from February 7 to March 8 across venues in India and Sri Lanka.The BCB’s concerns followed Mustafizur’s release from the Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) squad amid reports of attacks on Hindus in Bangladesh.As per the current schedule, Bangladesh are set to play their first three group matches in Kolkata, followed by their final group game in Mumbai.After Mustafizur was released by KKR, the Bangladesh government also banned the broadcast of the Indian Premier League in the country.","Bangladesh have expressed reservations about touring India for the T20 World Cup.

NEW DELHI: Saurashtra secured a place in the semifinals of the Vijay Hazare Trophy after defeating Uttar Pradesh by 17 runs through the VJD method in a rain-hit contest at the BCCI's center of excellence in Bengaluru on Monday.

NAVI MUMBAI: Two matches of the ongoing fourth season of the Women’s Premier League (WPL) on January 14 and 15 at the DY Patil Stadium here are likely to be held behind closed doors, with Mumbai Police unable to provide adequate security due to the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) elections scheduled for January 15.Apparently, the Mumbai police has informed the Board that it won’t be able to depute enough personnel for the WPL fixtures, forcing the BCCI to have matches without crowds.""The BMC election is on Jan 15, so we are thinking of whether we would be able to have crowds in the stands or not.

PARIS: Former Marseille coach Rolland Courbis, a charismatic figure of French soccer who later became a prominent pundit, has died, his employer said on Monday. He was 72.RMC radio did not disclose the cause of the death in a statement released in agreement with Courbis' family.Born in Marseille, Courbis came through the club's academy. A rugged defender, he was part of the team that won the French league and cup double in 1972 and returned to the club in the late 1990s as coach.As a player, he also won two French league titles and a French Cup with Monaco.""A Marseillais at heart, he embodied popular, dynamic football. His unmistakable accent carried his frank, direct, often passionate and always sincere words,"" Marseille said in a tribute.Courbis enjoyed a much-traveled coaching career, with spells in France and abroad, notably at Bordeaux, Lens, Montpellier and the USM Alger.Among the many defining moments of his career was a stunning comeback he oversaw when coaching Marseille. His team found itself 4-0 down at home to Montpellier in 1998 but fought back to seal a remarkable 5-4 victory.Courbis, who had a taste for casino gambling and lived with an Italian countess for a while, led a tumultuous life.He was seriously wounded in 1996 when gunmen fatally shot the president of a French soccer team outside a stadium following a game. Courbis, who was also involved in several legal cases and sentenced to prison, was hit by a bullet during the attack.France coach Didier Deschamps said that with his passing, French soccer lost ""a fine connoisseur of football and its inner workings, but also of the game itself.""""He was a true passionate figure,"" Deschamps added. ""And in recent years, he chose to pass on that passion behind a microphone, with a turn of phrase all his own.""Since 2005, he had become a consultant on RMC, where he commented on football news.""His passion came through in his trademark Marseille accent and in a very direct rapport with listeners,"" RMC said. ""A freedom of tone that kept the language of the supporters, while sharing their questions and emotions. He was particularly successful in remaining approachable and warm, while still being demanding on substance.""","Former Marseille coach Rolland Courbis has died, his employer says. He was 72.

It was already a bruising night for Manchester United and their captain. Hours after the club's FA Cup journey ended with a 2–1 defeat to Brighton, Bruno Fernandes found himself at the centre of an unexpected storm off the pitch, after his official X account was hacked and began posting a series of bizarre and taunting messages.Fernandes played the full 90 minutes in the third-round loss on Sunday, a result that compounded United's inconsistent season. Later that night, however, confusion spread among supporters when the Portuguese midfielder's verified X account — followed by more than 4.5 million users — suddenly sprang to life for the first time in months.The posts initially appeared to promote cryptocurrency-related content, asking followers for help “making a coin” and expressing mock confusion over crypto platforms. Within minutes, the tone shifted sharply, with messages openly mocking Manchester United's struggles just hours after their FA Cup exit. One post read: “Man Utd are in the dumps,” while another claimed, “This is why I need to get paid more.”As the situation escalated, the hacker began tagging high-profile accounts, including YouTuber KSI, world darts champion Luke Littler, the England cricket team and even adult star Bonnie Blue.One message bizarrely promoted Macclesfield FC, fresh from their shock FA Cup upset of Crystal Palace.Manchester United were quick to acknowledge the breach. In a statement from the club's official account, United warned supporters: “Bruno Fernandes' X account has been hacked. Fans should not interact with any posts or direct messages.”Despite the warning, the individual behind the hack continued to post and reply, even mocking the situation with comments such as: “Aren't you having fun?” One of the most provocative posts resurfaced an image of Liverpool's infamous 7–0 win over United at Anfield in March 2023, rubbing salt into fresh wounds.The hacked account also replied sarcastically to teenage United prospect Shea Lacey, who had apologised publicly after being sent off against Brighton.Fernandes, who rarely uses X, had last posted in October to mark his 300th appearance for the club. By late night, the posts were deleted as club officials worked to regain control.The incident adds Fernandes to a growing list of elite players targeted online, highlighting the increasing vulnerability of high-profile athletes in the digital age.","Manchester United captain Bruno Fernandes' official X account was hacked.

United in disarray

MANCHESTER: Manchester United 's problems mounted as the managerless Red Devils crashed out of the FA Cup after a 2-1 defeat against Brighton on Sunday. Brajan Gruda put Brighton ahead in the first half at Old Trafford and former United striker Danny Welbeck netted after the break.Benjamin Sesko's reply came too late to save his side from a third round exit as United teenager Shea Lacey was sent off in the final moments.United were barraged by jeers from furious fans following the latest miserable result in another troubled season.Caretaker boss Darren Fletcher has failed to stop the rot following Ruben Amorim's shock sacking on Monday, with United looking to appoint an interim manager until the end of the season.Former United boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Michael Carrick, a decorated ex-United midfielder, have both been linked with the temporary role.But regardless of United's past pedigree, the chaos enveloping Old Trafford hardly makes it an appealing job for any manager of stature these days.Welbeck, 35, was at United when they won their most recent Premier League title in 2013 under Alex Ferguson, who watched the Brighton debacle from the director's box as the current generation showed how far they have fallen from the Scot's golden era.United, currently a disappointing seventh in the Premier League, are without a win in four games and have managed only one victory in their last seven matches.That wretched form is unlikely to improve anytime soon with United hosting Manchester City next weekend before travelling to Premier League leaders Arsenal on January 25.After a humiliating League Cup loss at fourth tier Grimsby in August, United have exited both domestic cups at the first hurdle for the first time since 1981-82.Avenging their 2023 FA Cup semi-final loss to United, Brighton have now won on four of their last five visits to Old Trafford.United midfielder Kobbie Mainoo started for only the second time this season as Fletcher left Casemiro on the bench in one of three changes from the midweek 2-2 draw at lowly Burnley.Albion keeper Jason Steele made fine saves to deny Diogo Dalot and Bruno Fernandes in the early stages.But Brighton made the most of those escapes to take the lead in the 12th minute.Welbeck was the catalyst with an incisive run and cross to Georginio Rutter, whose header was cleared off the line by Lisandro Martinez before Gruda slammed past Senne Lammens from close-range.United were in disarray and chants against co-owners Jim Ratcliffe and the Glazer family rang around Old Trafford.Fernandes sent a free-kick wide and Matheus Cunha was narrowly off-target as United trudged off with boos ringing in their ears at half-time.Mainoo was hauled off in the second half after a lacklustre display that did little to rebuke Amorim's decision to ignore him for much of this season.United's problems are far wider than just Mainoo and Brighton punished their shambolic defending to double the lead in the 64th minute.Gruda was given time and space to pick out Welbeck inside the area and he lashed an exquisite strike past Lammens as the atmosphere turned even more toxic.Sesko set up a frenetic finale after heading home from Fernandes' 85th minute corner.But United couldn't muster a late escape as Lacey, already on a booking, brought a fitting end to a painful defeat when he was sent off for throwing the ball away in frustration.",Manchester United crashed out of the FA Cup after a 2-1 defeat against Brighton.

Poll What do you think of Kazuyoshi Miura's decision to play professional football at 58? Inspiring Questionable Unusual but brave

Kazuyoshi Miura is not ready to fade away. At 58, the former Japan international striker has vowed to show he still belongs on the football pitch as he prepares for an extraordinary 41st professional season, extending a career that began nearly four decades ago.Popularly known as “King Kazu,” Miura has joined third-division side Fukushima United on a six-month loan ahead of the new Japanese season, which kicks off in early February. The move brings him back into the J. League structure for the first time in five years and underlines his refusal to let age dictate the end of his playing days.Speaking at his official unveiling in Tokyo on Friday, Miura said he was determined to repay the faith shown in him by his new club. “Strikers can score goals in bunches or they can go through dry spells, and you have to have an image in your mind of scoring goals,” he told reporters. “It’s difficult to put a number on it but I definitely want to score and assist.”Still brimming with ambition, Miura added that he wants to contribute in multiple ways. “I’d like to dribble down the left wing and whip in crosses,” he said, offering a glimpse of the attacking intent that has defined his long career.Miura made his professional debut in 1986 with Brazilian giants Santos and has since played across the globe, turning out for clubs in Italy, Croatia, Australia and Portugal. He was a central figure in popularising football in Japan, particularly after the launch of the professional J. League in 1993.Last season, Miura featured for fourth-tier Atletico Suzuka, making eight appearances without scoring as the club was relegated after finishing second from bottom and losing a playoff. Despite the setback, he remains undeterred.Miura, who earned 89 caps and scored 55 goals for Japan but was famously omitted from their 1998 World Cup squad, summed up his motivation simply: “I just want to be on the pitch, even for just one minute or one second longer.”","Kazuyoshi Miura has joined third-division side Fukushima United on a six-month loan ahead of the new Japanese season, which kicks off in early February.

Arsenal winger Gabriel Martinelli has issued a public apology to Liverpool defender Conor Bradley after a controversial late incident marred the goalless Premier League draw at the Emirates, drawing fierce criticism from pundits and rival players alike.The flashpoint occurred deep into stoppage time when Bradley went down near the touchline after landing awkwardly while making a clearance. As the Liverpool defender lay in visible pain, Martinelli attempted to hurry the restart by dropping the ball on him and then shoving him off the pitch. Bradley eventually left the stadium on crutches with his knee strapped, raising fears of a serious injury.The Brazilian winger was shown a yellow card, but some former players felt the punishment was lenient. On Sky Sports, Roy Keane branded Martinelli's conduct “a disgrace,” while Gary Neville described it as “absolutely disgraceful,” reflecting the widespread backlash that followed the final whistle.Responding to the criticism, Martinelli took to Instagram to offer a heartfelt apology, revealing he had already contacted Bradley directly.“Conor and I have messaged and I've already apologised to him,” Martinelli wrote. “I really didn't understand he was seriously injured in the heat of the moment. I want to say I'm deeply sorry for reacting. Sending Conor all my best again for a quick recovery.”Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta came out in defence of his player, insisting there was no malicious intent. “Knowing Gabi, there's zero intention,” Arteta said. “Probably he doesn't know [Bradley is injured]. He's an incredible, lovely guy and would never do that if he knew the situation.”Liverpool boss Arne Slot echoed that view while expressing concern over Bradley's condition. “Let's hope for the best, but I fear the worst for Conor Bradley,” Slot said. “You cannot expect Martinelli to think so clearly in the 94th minute. I'm 100 percent sure that if he knew what the injury might be, he would never do that.”However, Slot also admitted his discomfort at seeing an injured player being moved. “I didn't like to see one of my players being moved out of the pitch if he might have such a big injury,” he added.The match itself ended 0-0, marking Arsenal's first home blank of the season but still extending their lead at the top of the table to six points over Manchester City.","Gabriel Martinelli has issued a public apology to Liverpool defender Conor Bradley after a controversial late incident.

From Kolkata Chaos to Delhi Celebration: Lionel Messi’s G.O.A.T India Tour At A Glance

BUENOS AIRES: Lionel Messi would prefer to become a club owner rather than a coach when he quits as a player, the Argentina football star has said.In October, he signed a three-year contract extension with Inter Miami to take him through the 2028 season.“I don’t see myself as a coach,” the 38-year-old Messi told the Luzu TV streaming channel in an interview recorded in December that aired Tuesday. “I like management, but if have to decide for one of the three I would like to be an owner.“I would like to have my own club, to be able to grow it, to start from the bottom and to be able to give the kids, the people, the opportunity to grow and make it an important club. If I had to choose, that’s what would appeal to me most.”Messi, who led Argentina to the World Cup title in Qatar in 2022, is already a part owner of Uruguay’s fourth-division team Deportivo LSM, which is co-owned by Inter teammate Luis Suarez.“Deportivo LS is a family dream that began in 2018. We have grown a lot with more than 3,000 members,” club founder Suarez said last May in a video alongside Messi. “I want to offer Uruguayan football, the place I love and where I grew up as a child, opportunities and tools for teenagers and children to grow.”The eight-time Ballon d’Or winner Messi also has a future minority ownership stake in Inter included in his contract.Messi won the MLS Golden Boot this season after scoring 29 goals, five more than LAFC’s Denis Bouanga and Nashville’s Sam Surridge. He also had 19 assists, and his 48 total goal contributions was one shy of matching the league record set by Carlos Vela in 2019.Messi also became the became the first player to win back-to-back MVP awards in MLS history.",Lionel Messi would prefer to become a club owner rather than a coach when he quits as a player.

Antonio Brown’s fiery reaction sparks social media buzz after DK Metcalf’s costly mistake in Steelers vs Texans wild-card game,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/antonio-browns-fiery-reaction-sparks-social-media-buzz-after-dk-metcalfs-costly-mistake-in-steelers-vs-texans-wild-card-game/articleshow/126496351.cms,"Antonio Brown and DK Metcalf (Image via: IG/Getty)

The early DK Metcalf moment and Antonio Brown ’s reaction that set the tone for the Steelers

The wild-card match between the Pittsburgh Steelers and the Houston Texans resulted in a first half that was low-stress, and every snap had a point. With such narrow margins, DK Metcalf, a wide receiver, was an early target following an expensive error that halted a good Steelers drive. That moment, which was no less than an act of execution in a postseason game, soon acquired some added weight, as the discussion raged on long after the field as Pittsburgh entered the halftime with only one point in the lead.The play occurred during the first quarter when the Aaron Rodgers threw to Metcalf on a break towards the right side of the field. It was a catchable pass and could have swung first momentum, however the contact was not made, stopping the drive in its tracks.The missed opportunity became special in playoff football, where there are limited opportunities and defense is on the increase. A second time drop later in the half just added to the feeling that the Steelers were leaving good yards out there. With the replays in the broadcasts and the timelines, the former Steelers wide receiver Antonio Brown contributed to the discussion with a row of posts on social media.Brown posted a edited photo with the reference to the drops and tagged it with the following, “I’m open- DK Metcalf”, a remark that rapidly went viral and served to further scrutinize the Steelers receiver.The response highlighted how miscues at playoffs might easily transform into a viral trend, particularly when ex-players express their opinions on the matter in the public.Though the offensive was not complete, Pittsburgh remained close to the competition. The halftime score was 7-6, with C.J. Stroud passing a touchdown pass in the second quarter, but the Steelers were trailing on two field goals by Chris Boswell. Metcalf had two receptions and 42 yards in the first half with Rodgers making 9 of 15 pass attempts and 79 yards. As head coach Mike Tomlin made changes, the question turned to whether the Steelers would be able to overcome the initial missteps and remake the story in the second half.","Pittsburgh Steelers wide receiver DK Metcalf dropped a pass in the first quarter against the Houston Texans.

Tyreek Hill reacts in surprise after Fred Warner’s recovery video goes viral across the NFL,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/tyreek-hill-reacts-in-surprise-after-fred-warners-recovery-video-goes-viral-catching-fans-and-players-off-guard-across-the-nfl/articleshow/126495960.cms,"Fred Warner (Image via: AP)

Fred Warner’s recovery clip quickly becomes a talking point around the league

In NFL, recovery of injuries tends to be scripted. Players are slow, teams are conservative and information is not very forthcoming. This is why a little social media video by the linebacker of San Francisco 49ers Fred Warner immediately caught eye. And only a few days following a wounding playoff victory and a few weeks ago following a severe ankle injury, Warner appeared surprisingly fresh. His mobility, balance and confidence caused a buzz throughout the league.One who was studying closely was Miami Dolphins wide receiver Tyreek Hill, whose response would be a perfect example of the unexpectedness of the progress that Warner would have. It did not take long to be talked about among the most incredible stories of recovery in the postseason.Warner posted the video on Monday, just a day after the San Francisco 49ers survived a close Wild Card win of 23-19 over the Philadelphia Eagles. On the film, it is possible to observe that Warner is training catches and moving fluently, as it seems strange considering how badly he has been hurt lately.The message was viral in nature and received both fan and player feedbacks. Tyreek Hill summed up the overall disbelief by simply responding on X, “ Fred Warner who your trainers.”It was not just a joke in the comment. It was sincerely amazed at the extent to which Warner had gone in the recuperation campaign.The recovery of Warner is particularly epic when compared to the chronology of the injury. He injured his ankle September 13 in a tackle with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Such injuries can take a long period of rehabilitation, and there is no guarantee that one can be back to the top form in the same season.But the most recent video by Warner gives an impression that momentum is gaining. The observers of the league feel that the extent of his practice might open earlier than anticipated, a move that will immensely enhance the defense of the 49ers as the season takes on a more aggressive aspect in the post season.The response given by Hill also has some context. The Dolphins star is battling back after he had a leg injury of his own, and one can only be impressed and pay attention to the visible success of Warner. Warner has turned things around in a league where patience is generally being preached. It is no longer just an update. It has now become a reminder of the unpredictable and amazing NFL comebacks.","Fred Warner posted a video on social media showing his recovery from an ankle injury.

Playoff heartbreak leads Jason Kelce to blame teammates, absolving coaches completely



The reigning Super Bowl champions will not have a chance to defend their crown after the Eagles’ season ended abruptly with a 23-19 loss to the 49ers in the wild-card round. The Eagles’ offense, once a high-powered unit, sputtered when it mattered most, managing only six second-half points despite a roster stacked with talent. Their early momentum against a depleted San Francisco defense quickly faded, leaving fans and analysts questioning why Philadelphia’s attack failed under pressure.While critics have often singled out offensive coordinator Kevin Patullo for the team’s struggles, Eagles legend Jason Kelce shifted the spotlight elsewhere. “I know that everybody is out on Kevin Patullo, I happen to know the guy, I love Kevin Patullo. I know he’s a great coach. I know it wasn’t the best performance this year offensively,” Kelce said on ESPN Monday. “They had the No. 1 highest-paid offense in the league and were mediocre across the board. That’s unacceptable. They had their chances to win that game yesterday, and they-the players-didn’t make the plays.”Kelce’s comments highlight a deeper problem: execution on the field. He praised San Francisco’s coaching and strategic plays, noting, “What Robert Saleh did, that defense, is commendable.What they’ve done to get to here is absolutely a testament to that organization and how well they’re built and they function across the board. Kyle Shanahan with the trickeration, finding a way to get things open, you tip your cap to them, but Philly had their opportunities. ”Analyst Marcus Spears echoed Kelce’s sentiment, pointing to critical mistakes on key plays. “This is the playoffs. It’s on the line and you don’t go to your $100 million receiver that’s in man-to-man coverage,” Spears said. “I don’t care if he dropped passes earlier in the game. I don’t care what the situation is. Even DeVonta, your first-round draft pick that you paid is out there singled-up. If not for going for that one-on-one, you threw the ball in the middle of the field with three defenders around the receivers. Stop it, man!”Regardless of potential coaching changes, the Eagles face a clear message: talent alone won’t win games. With the league’s highest-paid offensive roster, consistent execution is non-negotiable. If Philadelphia hopes to contend again next season, the players themselves must rise to the occasion and deliver when it counts most.Also Read: Shannon Sharpe explains how Dallas politics shut the door on Troy Aikman’s Cowboys front office future","Jason Kelce blames teammates, not coaching staff, for Eagles' playoff loss.

Shannon Sharpe drops blunt truth on why Troy Aikman was never welcomed into Cowboys leadership



Troy Aikman’s growing influence with the Miami Dolphins has sparked plenty of debate about why he hasn’t been tapped for a similar role with the Dallas Cowboys. Aikman has long expressed interest in running an NFL franchise, yet while he helps the Dolphins identify their next general manager and head coach, his hometown team has never extended the same opportunity. The answer, according to Shannon Sharpe, lies in the nature of credit and control in Dallas.“Because [Falcons owner Arthur Blank] doesn’t care about the credit,” Sharpe said, pointing out the difference between Miami’s approach and Dallas’ leadership style. “You know who cares about the credit.” That “you know who” is Jerry Jones, the Cowboys’ owner, who Sharpe argues prioritizes attention over collaboration. Jones’ need to be seen as the central figure in all decisions has likely prevented him from inviting someone like Aikman, who could overshadow him while trying to restore the franchise to championship form.Aikman’s role with the Dolphins contrasts sharply with opportunities or the lack thereof in Dallas. He recently told The Musers, a Dallas sports radio show, that while the Dolphins approached him about assisting in their executive search, he has never been contacted by Jones for any Cowboys personnel decisions over the years.This absence of outreach underscores a recurring pattern: Jones is more concerned with visibility than sharing responsibility.Sharpe highlighted a recent incident where Jones compared himself to a political figure in a bizarre analogy about running the team.“Did you not hear the man say he’s like Trump Venezuela? He’s running Venezuela?” Sharpe said. The point is clear: Jones wants the spotlight, and bringing in someone like Aikman could dilute it. Meanwhile, owners like Arthur Blank, who recently welcomed Matt Ryan back to the Falcons as president of football operations, demonstrate that trusting experienced veterans can produce both results and respect without ego clashes.For Aikman, the Dolphins provide a platform to exercise his football insight freely, without navigating the attention-driven dynamics that define the Cowboys’ front office. For Dallas, the question remains whether chasing credit will continue to outweigh building a sustainable path to another Super Bowl Also Read: Aaron Rodgers’ secret wife remains unseen as Steelers playoff run fuels wild speculation among NFL fans","Troy Aikman's growing influence with the Miami Dolphins has sparked plenty of debate about why he hasn't been tapped for a similar role with the Dallas Cowboys.

George Kittle's torn Achilles leaves emotional void but fuels 49ers resolve



George Kittle's torn Achilles changed everything in Philadelphia, even as the 49ers walked off with a 23-19 wild-card win that should have felt lighter. Victory usually brings relief. This one carried weight. When Kittle went down in the second quarter, the stadium noise fell away, replaced by the kind of silence players recognize instantly. San Francisco advanced, but it did so without the heartbeat of its offense, a leader whose presence stretches far beyond box scores.Inside the locker room, the moment turned deeply human. Kittle was carted away, greeted not by cameras but by care. His wife, Claire, was there. So was owner Jed York, who honored a simple request with a bottle of tequila. The scene captured what the tight end means to the organization. Pain sat beside loyalty, and resolve followed close behind.George Kittle broke his silence the next day, sharing his first public words since the injury.“Football sucks sometimes,” Kittle wrote on Instagram on Monday. “But I love it. I love these guys and this team. Heartbroken but have felt so much love and support from everyone reaching out.I’ll be good. Thank you. We aren’t done yet! Also when your team owner is the first person to meet you in the locker room, you know you’re in a special place. 🥃 cheers, all my love.”Those lines revealed more than frustration. They showed acceptance, gratitude, and defiance. Kittle spoke like someone already looking forward, even as doctors confirmed the most serious injury of his career. A torn Achilles ends his season and likely keeps him sidelined well into next year. After battling a hamstring issue earlier, this setback hits harder, both physically and emotionally.Yet Kittle never stopped lifting others. Fullback Kyle Juszczyk recalled a halftime exchange that steadied the room.""I'm not dead yet, man. I'll be back. Go win it.’”Christian McCaffrey echoed that spirit after the game.“He’s somebody that, even going through something that he had to go through, us finding a way to finish, he’s the first guy in the locker room smiling, bumping music, happy for his teammates,” McCaffrey said Sunday. “When you lose a leader like that, you never really lose him because his presence is still in this locker room, his energy is still here. We’re praying for him, love him, going to play for him the rest of the way. ”The timing stings. San Francisco now heads to Seattle without Kittle, Nick Bosa, Mykel Williams, and possibly Fred Warner. Still, belief travels with them. Juszczyk said it best.""Even when he was down, he was still positive. I came in at halftime and he was smiling, and he said, 'I'm not dead yet, man. I'll be back. Go win it,'"" Juszczyk recounted. ""And that meant a lot.""Kittle will watch from home on Jan. 17, but his voice will echo at Lumen Field. The 49ers carry more than a game plan.

Dak Prescott’s net worth journey from rookie deals to NFL’s highest-paid quarterback



A look at Dak Prescott’s endorsements, investments, and off-field success



When Dak Prescott entered the NFL in 2016, few could have predicted the financial curve he would follow over the next decade. Prescott was selected in the fourth round of the draft by the Dallas Cowboys, but many other teams seemed to have passed on him, and the Cowboys were interested in using him as a replacement for Tony Romo. Yet in his debut season, Prescott got the award of the NFL Rookie of the Year, and since then, the net worth of Prescott continues rising as he advances in his career as one of the best quarterbacks in the NFL.The decade since his NFL debut has been a story of resilience, on-field leadership, and strategic financial growth. From a modest rookie salary to blockbuster contracts and diverse business ventures, Prescott has built a net worth that reflects not just his talent but also his business acumen. As the year 2026 continues, Dak’s life seems to have come a full circle with the “2026 is the new 2016"" message that symbolically relays the strength of the foundation established in the formative years of his life in the face of today’s challenges.Prescott’s entry into the NFL began with a standard four-year, $2.7 million rookie contract. In his first season, he earned a base salary of around $540,000, gradually increasing to $630,000 in 2018 and $2.2 million in 2019.During these years, his net worth remained in the low millions, supplemented by early endorsements. Despite the modest pay, Prescott’s leadership on the field quickly made him the face of the Cowboys and a promising franchise quarterback.The next stage of Prescott’s financial rise came in 2020 when he was franchised by Dallas, earning over $31 million that season. However, by the year 2021, he signed a deal that would see him receive a contract extension worth four years, valued at $160 million, with a signing bonus worth $66 million and had $126 million guaranteed.In 2024, Prescott secured another massive four-year, $240 million deal, including an $80 million signing bonus and $231 million in guaranteed money. Indeed, with his annual salary averaging $60 million, he became at that time the highest-paid player in NFL history. As of late 2025, his net worth was estimated at $90 million (as per Celebrity Net Worth), a figure that includes earnings both on the field and off.Prescott has diversified his earnings beyond football. His endorsements include major brands such as Adidas, Nike, AT&T, Beats, and Pepsi. Beyond endorsements, he co-owns Walk-On’s Sports Bistreaux, a Louisiana Creole-themed bar, and has investments in GLOW Beverages, OxeFit, and RealTruck. He also channels resources into philanthropy through his Faith. Fight. Finish. Foundation, honoring his late mother and brother by supporting families, communities, and youth development.Although there have been highs and lows in terms of performance on the field, such as playoff games and missing matches, his career path is an example of what can be accomplished through perseverance, performance, and strategic planning in a span of a decade, starting as a fourth-round Rookie and progressing to a Franchise Quarterback and Business-Savvy Athlete.","Dak Prescott was selected by the Dallas Cowboys in the fourth round of the 2008 NFL draft.

Reporter’s compassionate postgame comment to Jaguars head coach Liam Coen triggers heated debate among fans



Lynn Jones-Turpin's Jaguars press conference moments are usually brief, routine, and quickly forgotten, but this one took a very different turn. After Jacksonville’s narrow playoff loss to the Buffalo Bills, a short exchange between a veteran reporter and the Jaguars’ head coach cut through the standard postgame script and landed squarely in the national spotlight.What should have been a quiet end to the season instead became a flashpoint for a larger conversation about sports media, professionalism, and empathy. Within hours, the moment spread across social platforms, drawing strong reactions from journalists, fans, and broadcasters alike. Some praised the warmth behind the words. Others questioned whether emotion belongs at the podium.After the Jaguars fell 27-24 to the Bills, Lynn Jones-Turpin used her brief moment at the microphone to console head coach Liam Coen. Her words were simple and direct. ""I’m going to tell you, congratulations on your success, young man,"" Jones-Turpin said. ""You hold your head up. You guys have had a most magnificent season. You did a great job out there today. You just hold your head up, OK? Ladies and gentlemen, Duval. You keep it going. We got another season."" Coen replied softly, ""Thank you, ma'am,"" smiling as the room shifted.That 19-second clip ignited social media after ESPN’s Adam Schefter shared it, calling it an uplifting exchange.Within hours, millions had weighed in. Critics argued that press conferences are not pep rallies. Supporters pushed back, saying compassion does not erase credibility. The debate exposed a familiar tension between objectivity and empathy in modern sports coverage.Jones-Turpin, 64, did not retreat. She explained her reasoning plainly. ""I can understand the motivating words, because keep your head up. Why we need to keep talking about the 4th quarter punt, and the this, and the that. The season is over! Why do I need to continue to browbeat you about that?"" she said. ""That man had the weight of the city on him, and he's only been here a year. You understand what I'm saying here? This is just football. ""Her background gives context to that choice. Detroit born and Jacksonville rooted, Jones-Turpin has covered communities as much as teams. She has interviewed Barack Obama and Tiger Woods, yet nothing matched the sudden glare of becoming the internet’s auntie. Still, deadlines waited. ""I gotta go to work. I gotta get the paper out this week!"" she said.As subscriptions surged and messages poured in, Jones-Turpin stayed grounded. She embraced the moment without chasing it.

Josh Allen , Hailee Steinfeld and the lesson that reshaped his identity



Josh Allen and Hailee Steinfeld has become more than a headline tied to sports and Hollywood. It now signals a personal shift for one of the NFL ’s biggest stars. In a season packed with pressure, playoff expectations, and public scrutiny, the Buffalo Bills quarterback is choosing to speak about something quieter but far more revealing. It is not about yards gained or trophies earned. It is about identity, growth, and the steady influence of the woman beside him.At 29, Allen stands at the peak of his professional powers, yet his latest words show a man reflecting beyond the field. In an interview shared by ESPN Originals, he did not speak like a franchise quarterback selling confidence. He spoke like a husband who has learned how grounding love can be when life moves fast. That honesty has resonated, especially because it comes during one of the busiest chapters of his life.Allen did not hesitate when describing his admiration for his wife. “My wife is an unbelievable, undeniable rockstar in her work and in her life as a person,” he said. “She's everything that I need in my life.” The praise felt natural, not rehearsed. It reflected respect for Steinfeld not only as a celebrated actor but as a partner who brings balance to his world.When asked what she has taught him about himself, Allen paused. That moment mattered. His response revealed how deeply the lesson runs. “Maybe that I am more than a football player,” he said. “My whole dream as a kid was to be in this position and I never thought of anything outside that or beyond that, and you know hopefully I get to still play this game for a very long time.” The words carried the weight of someone who has spent years defining himself through performance alone.That realization arrives at a powerful time. The couple, who began dating in 2023 and married quietly in 2025, are now preparing to welcome their first child. They shared the news in December, later posting a joint video online. “I love you ❤️,” Allen wrote in the comments, a simple message that said enough.Their worlds collided again on Jan. 11. Allen led the Bills to a 27-24 playoff win over the Jaguars while Steinfeld celebrated two Golden Globe wins for Sinners. Though miles apart, support flowed freely. As the Bills move toward the divisional round against the Broncos, Allen carries more than championship hopes. He carries perspective, shaped by love, partnership, and the understanding that life, like football, has chapters beyond the next play.Also Read: Justin Herbert’s romance with Madison Beer creates headlines as couple embraces hard launch in style",Josh Allen and Hailee Steinfeld are preparing to welcome their first child.

Drake Maye’s wife Ann Michael breaks silence on constant comparisons to Gisele Bündchen,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/drake-mayes-wife-ann-michael-breaks-silence-on-constant-comparisons-to-gisele-bndchen/articleshow/126494359.cms,"Drake Maye’s wife Ann Michael Maye addressed comparisons to Gisele Bündchen, sparked by Patriots fans revisiting the Tom Brady era. Speaking openly, Ann said she finds most comments funny and kind, while gently pushing back on criticism of Bündchen, making it clear she is focused on her own life, not replacing anyone.

Ann Michael Maye responds with grace as comparisons grow louder



The New England Patriots are back in the game and along with the victory, comes a publicity that extends beyond the field. With rookie quarterback Drake Maye still bringing vitality to the fan base, the focus has now broadened to his wife, Ann Michael Maye, who has in turn become a somewhat familiar face on-line.What began as harmless fan-worship has turned into an ongoing draw parallels on the companion of Tom Brady, Gisele Bundchen , of the past. Rather than simply sacking the chatter, Ann tackled it with good intent and insight, opting against aggression and instead of engaging in a fight, she selected aiding humor as the Patriots culture struggles once more with the past and future.Ann has leaned into fan engagement through TikTok and Instagram , where lighthearted comments dominate her posts. Speaking candidly with Barstool Sports founder Dave Portnoy, she explained why she reads everything.""I always look [at the comments]. Everyone's got to give them a scroll. They're so funny. People really just ran with it. No one is mean. That's the best part. It's always really nice... It's always like 'tuck my husband' and 'tuck our husband into bed,'""Portnoy acknowledged a sharper edge in some fan reactions, noting, ""I've seen it. I read people even taking shots at Gisele,"" a trend Ann had already noticed herself.""Yeah, it's always 'Gisele would never this... Gisele would never that,'"" she said, before offering a calm reminder that cut through the noise. ""But she's been pretty good, guys, okay?""Her response struck a chord because it refused to fuel rivalry. Instead, it reinforced balance. While Maye’s on-field success invites inevitable comparisons to a Patriots legend, Ann made it clear she is not auditioning for a legacy role. She is building her own space, enjoying community support, and letting her husband define his career without borrowed shadows. In a market obsessed with history, that restraint may be the most refreshing statement of all.Also Read: Drake Maye’s wife Ann mixes fashion and focus with bold look and two-word message before playoff game","Ann Michael Maye responds with grace as comparisons grow louder to Gisele Bündchen.

ESPN senior writer announces moratorium signed between WNBA and WNBPA

Napheesa Collier breaks the silence on failure to reach an agreement on a new CBA

Also Read:

The WNBA and the WNBPA had agreed on a 6-week extension to figure out the differences on the Collective Bargaining Agreement. Announced on November 30, the extension deadline was January 9. However, both sides failed to reach an agreement by the deadline and now both the WNBA and the player association have decided to sign a moratorium for all legal business purposes.ESPN’s senior writer, Ramona Shelburne, made the announcement on X. The moratorium will only exist till the time the new CBA receives the formal consent for its functioning. This will put the free agency on hold while the rules of the former CBA will continue to exist. This is in order to conform to the US Labor laws.ESPN’s senior writer, Ramona Shelburne, made an important announcement on January 12, 2026. Ever since the WNBA and the players’ association failed to reach an agreement on the CBA, both sides have entered the status quo. This means that the rules of the previous CBA remain unchanged and allow both sides to continue negotiations. Under these rules, the agreement also prevents the league and its players from going on strike without proper notice.Now, on January 12, the league has decided to sign a moratorium with the players’ association.ESPN’s Ramona made the announcement on X. She wrote, “The WNBA and WNBPA have reached an agreement on a moratorium for league business, sources tell ESPN. This is necessary because the sides had failed to reach an agreement on a new CBA agreement or an extension by the January 9 deadline.” This will halt the initial stages of free agency. Here, the team would have sought to deliver qualifying offers and franchise tag designations to players. Ramona further wrote in the announcement, “Didn’t make sense for teams to be offering qualifying offers, core designations or courting free agents until there was a new CBA.” The moratorium for both sides makes sense, as they lag apart on salaries and revenue sharing.Despite the 6-week extension, both the WNBA and the WNBPA failed to reach an agreement on the new CBA. Breaking her silence on the issue, the Vice-President of the WNBA, Napheesa Collier, commented, “Obviously, we'd hoped that we would be a lot farther along than we are, because it's been about [15] months at this point, but at the same time, we have to stay strong in what our values are and what we're standing for.”She emphasized the kind of unity that the players were experiencing. Napheesa added, “The players feel really united right now. We're waiting for the league to come back, and we're not going to accept a bad deal. We're waiting for the league to come back and respond to our thoughtful and reasonable proposals.”","ESPN’s senior writer, Ramona Shelburne, made an important announcement on January 12, 2026.

Ex-Timberwolves star questions Bam Adebayo’s star status



A'ja Wilson’s Miami Heat boyfriend under scrutiny amid team slump



The Miami Heat’s uneven start to the season has placed a bright spotlight on its core players. As the Heat sit at 20-19 and hovering around the middle of the Eastern Conference, questions continue to surface about where the team stands and who should carry it forward. Some young contributors have delivered steady production, yet the expectations are higher for the franchise pillars who define Miami’s identity.That focus has landed squarely on Bam Adebayo, the longest-tenured player on the roster and a central figure in the Heat’s plans. His recent performances have drawn reactions across the league, including a blunt assessment from a former Timberwolves guard that quickly turned heads and sparked debate. Adebayo, who is dating Las Vegas Aces center A'ja Wilson, has yet to find his footing this season.Former All-Star and longtime NBA guard Jeff Teague did not hold back while discussing Adebayo’s role during a recent appearance on Club 520. Teague addressed the growing conversation around Miami’s ceiling and framed Adebayo as a player whose impact falls short of the league’s elite tier.“Bam don’t really be killing. He’s just a good player. He’s not a star.He’s a good complimentary piece. He’s still a quality player, fringe All Star. I think if they get Ja Morant some new blood in there that can run P&Rs with him I think he’ll step up. I just don’t think he’s playing with a pure PG right now,” Teague said on Club 520.He commented during a stretch when Adebayo’s numbers had dipped by his own standards. He is averaging 16.4 points per game, his lowest mark since the 2019-20 season. His efficiency has also declined, with shooting splits of 44.6 percent from the field and 31.7 percent from three. Against Oklahoma City, the struggles were evident again as he scored six points in a 124-112 loss.Adebayo’s season has unfolded as Miami continues to search for stability. Injuries and lineup changes have limited continuity, a point Adebayo addressed publicly while explaining the team’s ongoing adjustments.“This is like the third game we’ve been fully healthy for the whole season, so it’s going to take some time. Guys have been in and out of lineups, plug and play, we’re trying to figure it out. So hopefully we can stay healthy and get through this bump and get back to winning some games.”The Heat followed those remarks with another loss, extending a three-game skid that included defeats to Minnesota, Indiana, and Oklahoma City. While Tyler Herro’s return offered optimism, Miami has yet to regain their strenght.Also Read: Why did NBA fine Jaylen Brown?

Lineups and broadcast details

LeBron James is in the lineup for the Los Angeles Lakers when they faced the Sacramento Kings on January 12, 2026. His availability has been confirmed well before tip-off, easing concerns around the Lakers, who are already dealing with injuries. On the road at the Golden 1 Center, James delivered a steady performance that reflected his current form.The game came at a point where the Lakers needed stability. With a 23-13 record, they were sitting fifth in the standings but coming off uneven results. Sacramento, at 9-30, remained in rebuild mode and struggled to keep pace with more experienced teams.Los Angeles Lakers enter the matchup as clear favorites. The Sacramento Kings are relying heavily on Russell Westbrook, but defensive issues continued to hurt them. The Lakers, meanwhile, were without Austin Reaves, which increased the load on James and Luka Doncic to manage the offense and control the tempo.Rather than pushing speed, the Lakers are expected to focus on clean possessions and limiting mistakes. LeBron James plays a central role in that approach, keeping the offense organized and making sure the team stays composed during key stretches.LeBron James enters the game with no injury restrictions. Earlier in the season, he had dealt with issues including sciatica, but those concerns were no longer affecting his status.Over recent outings, he had been averaging around 22 points, six rebounds, and seven assists, numbers that reflected a balanced role rather than a scoring-only focus.Betting lines mirror that outlook, setting his points, rebounds, and assists total at 37.5. Expectations are based on both his consistency and Sacramento’s defensive struggles.Sacramento are known to often send extra defenders toward James, which opens space for others. He handles pressure calmly, moves the ball early, and set up teammates such as Marcus Smart when help defense arrives. His reads helps the Lakers avoid long scoring droughts and keeps the game under control.The Lakers’ projected starting group featured Doncic, Smart, Rui Hachimura, James, and Deandre Ayton.

The Toronto Raptors are being linked to a major trade as the February 5, 2026, deadline approaches. League talk suggests Toronto has shown interest in Ja Morant, with the Memphis Grizzlies open to hearing offers for the two-time All-Star.Toronto’s interest is tied to performance, not hype. The Raptors sit in the middle of the playoff race but rank 20th in offense. The front office is weighing whether a high-level point guard upgrade could push the team from competitive to dangerous in the Eastern Conference, especially alongside Scottie Barnes and Brandon Ingram.The proposed deal would send Immanuel Quickley, Ochai Agbaji, and a 2026 lottery-protected first-round pick from Toronto Raptors to Memphis Grizzlies in exchange for Ja Morant.From a financial standpoint, the trade works. Quickley’s recent extension pays him about $32.5 million per season over the next three years, which aligns closely enough with Morant’s $197 million contract to meet league salary rules. The first-round pick adds value in a draft class viewed as deep, while Agbaji gives Memphis a young, defense-first wing.Ja Morant would immediately become Toronto’s primary ball-handler and offensive driver.His ability to create shots and pressure the rim addresses the Raptors’ biggest weakness. For a team currently sitting at 23-16, the move signals a push to compete now rather than wait for internal growth.Memphis gains flexibility. Moving Morant allows the Grizzlies to step away from ongoing injury concerns and off-court issues while adding multiple assets. Quickley provides steady scoring and playmaking as a potential long-term starter, Agbaji strengthens perimeter defense, and the draft pick gives the front office future options as the team reshapes its roster.Morant’s ceiling remains higher, even in a limited season, while Quickley offers consistency and availability.Morant, 26, averaged more than 23 points per game last season. Quickley, also 26, offers a lower ceiling but more predictable production.Also read: NBA trade rumors: Los Angeles Lakers potentially eyeing $80 million Houston Rockets star to for iconic trio with LeBron James and Luka Doncic Toronto would be taking on risk in exchange for star-level upside, betting that Morant can stay healthy and available.

Kawhi Leonard’s sneaker deal and strategic brand alliances



Kawhi Leonard was drafted as the 15th overall pick by the Indiana Pacers in 2011, but his rights were immediately traded to the Spurs. Later, he signed a 5-year, $90 million extension with them in 2015, and was eligible for a $221 million extension. But got traded to the Raptors while a year was left on the contract. Currently set to earn a staggering $50 million for this season, Leonard has transformed from a rising star to a global icon.Kawhi Leonard’s quiet and reserved personality, yet destructive ability and clutch performances on the court, earned him the nickname: silent superstar. But opposite to this nickname, his financial portfolio speaks with remarkable volume.According to Celebrity Net Worth, Kawhi Leonard’s net worth as of 2025 was estimated to be approximately $160 million, a figure driven by lucrative contract extensions and a landmark deal in the sneaker industry.But this wealth trajectory shifted into high gear during the 2018–2019 season after he led the Toronto Raptors to their first-ever NBA championship. He later signed with the Los Angeles Clippers, where he has since secured three major contracts: $103 million contract in 2019, then a 4-year, $176.3 million extension in 2021, and the most recent, 3-year, $149.5 million veteran extension in January 2024, as per Spotrac.By the time his current deal expires at the end of the 2026–2027 season, Kawhi’s career on-court earnings are projected to surpass $425 million.Leonard’s decision to sign with New Balance after leaving Jordan Brand in 2018 due to stalled negotiations was definitely a career-defining move. As per ESPN, New Balance offered $5 million per year, which was on par with Jordan’s $22 million over 4 years. Through this deal, New Balance returned to the NBA.When it comes to off-court interests and investments, Kawhi Leonard was in hot water after signing a $28 million endorsement deal with Aspiration in 2022. Aspiration was an environmental fintech startup that faced an NBA investigation for being a no-show job and eventually faced bankruptcy.Other than this, Leonard has a production company called Lavish, and his Klaw brand has long term long-term endorsements with companies like Cargo Jet and Honey, which significantly support his financial fortress.

From 2016 to 2020: How injuries shaped Joel Embiid’s first NBA years

From 2021 to 2026: How repeated injuries and recovery periods defined Embiid’s prime years

Joel Embiid, a center for the Philadelphia 76ers, was born on March 16, 1994. In the first round of the 2014 NBA Draft, he was chosen third. He has been named to the NBA All-Star squad seven times, the All-NBA squad five times, the All-Defensive Team three times, and the NBA scoring champion twice. He is a very promising player.In 2023, he was named NBA MVP. Embiid is thirty years old and has won two scoring titles, an Olympic gold medal, and league MVP ten years after being drafted. But he is very prone to injuries. The 76ers center was at the center of another injury-related controversy before the start of the 2024-25 NBA season after he made a startling statement regarding playing back-to-backs.According to Fox Sports, Joel Embiid had sustained over 100 injuries during his NBA career as of January 2065. His foot and knee issues, however, were the most severe, with some of them leading to injuries that ended his season.Embiid sustained a tumble during his 30th NBA game in January 2017, aggravating his left knee. As a result, he misses Philadelphia's following three games due to swelling and soreness. Embiid played a few games that same month before returning to the sidelines due to swelling in his left knee.It was revealed on February 11, 2017, that Embiid has a torn meniscus in his left knee, although surgery was not required.He was listed as doubtful because it resulted in knee oedema. Embiid was declared out indefinitely on February 27 due to swelling, two days later.Embiid then suffered an orbital fracture in March 2018 during a collision with teammate Markelle Fultz, which prevented him from playing for ten games in a row. This contains the first two games of the Sixers' playoff series against the Miami Heat in the opening round. He wore a black safety mask when he got back.During a victory over the Thunder on January 6, 2020, Embiid sustained a horrific finger injury. Embiid missed the following nine games for Philadelphia due to the injury, which necessitated surgery.In Game 4 of the Eastern Conference Playoffs against the Wizards on May 31, 2021, Embiid fell awkwardly. Afterwards, the 76ers revealed that Embiid would miss one game due to a partially torn meniscus in his right knee. When Embiid faced the Raptors in Game 3 of the Eastern Conference Playoffs in April 2022, he tore a ligament in his right thumb. According to reports, the ailment would necessitate surgery during the offseason.Then, in the fourth quarter of the 76ers' 119-107 loss to the Warriors in January 2024, Embiid was double-teamed in coverage by Golden State's Draymond Green and Jonathan Kuminga. Embiid collapsed to the ground as Kuminga forced the ball from his clutches. He missed 29 games due to the injury. He had surgery.After missing the whole preseason due to ""left knee injury management,"" Embiid was sidelined for Philadelphia's regular season start in October 2024.Then, in November 2024, Embiid played four games in nine days before being initially sidelined for Philadelphia's next two games due to swelling in his left knee. Embiid missed a total of seven games and was sidelined for two weeks due to the swelling, which went beyond the initial prediction.Embiid participated in four of Philadelphia's next five games until being ruled out on January 6, 2025, following reports that he sprained his foot on Christmas Day. Embiid has missed 15 games in a row after being initially categorized as day-to-day.

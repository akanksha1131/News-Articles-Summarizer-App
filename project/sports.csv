Champions Trophy: Pant's trademark no-look sixes and Iyer's clean hits steal the show

Team India arrives for practice amid loud cheers for Virat Kohli, Rohit Sharma, Hardik Pandya | EXCLUSIVE VISUALS

It's been three days since the Indian cricket team landed in Dubai and the majority of that time has been spent at the ICC Academy. There is very little gap between their first two games versus Bangladesh (February 20) and Pakistan (February 23), and it wasn't a surprise to see the Men in Blue sweat it out for hours at the global cricket body's training facilities not far from the venue of Champions Trophy fixtures.The bowlers had extended spells, batters didn't want to come out of the nets, the fielding coach ensured everyone underwent extended drills and the physios, strength & conditioning coach had a customised recovery plan for every individual.On both days - February 16 and February 17 - every squad member applied those crucial touches to their respective game before the multi-nation tournament gets underway. The order in which they honed their skills could be a subtle hint of the Playing XI, for the first game at least, but that had no say on the intensity they operated with.Shubman Gill might have created a record of sorts for the hours he spent batting; Rishabh Pant played with pain but smashed plenty with disdain; Rohit Sharma looked to find that touch; Virat Kohli seemed assured; KL Rahul flexed his batting muscle but the highlight across sessions was the batting of Shreyas Iyer and Hardik Pandya . The two were at their belligerent best and were severe against spin. A lot of ball-watching was essential as they smashed plenty out of the training ground and kept everyone on their toes.As far as bowlers are concerned, Mohammed Shami put fitness concerns, if any, to rest as the experienced seamer bowled lengthy spells during both sessions. He still has compression sleeves protecting the knees but there was no lack of rhythm when he operated with the new ball with Arshdeep Singh before Harshit Rana joined in the fast-bowling net. The spinners - all five of them - had the far net and there were plenty of fireworks as batters went bang, bang from the word go.Amid all the action and high-intensity preparations, the mood remained very upbeat as the players engaged in regular banter with each other. The warm-up and fielding drills served a lot of entertainment, and Arshdeep Singh was on the receiving end of a lot of sledging from the opposite group when his turn to hit the target would come. Senior players Virat Kohli, Rohit Sharma and Hardik Pandya joined in, and even fielding coach T Dilip got rapturous cheers when he took a stylish catch in the deep with the big glove on.Head coach Gautam Gambhir was very upbeat and played his part in the fun activities before the serious business got underway. He would do plenty of one-on-one conversations with players and support staff but was mostly stationed between the three nets so that he could keep an equal eye on the action. The last two days could well have been the most intense training days of the Champions Trophy as the action will soon take centrestage and India could have a light session on eve of the match. There is a possibility of them training at the Dubai International Stadium to get a feel of the venue and get used to the ring of fire, which could be an issue for the first-timers as it has its own set of challenges and is very different from the usual tower floodlights.The body language of all players was positive, the camaraderie was in full display and they seemed very relaxed during both afternoon and evening sessions. The little bit of free time was used by some players to take a trip to the famous Dubai Mall while most preferred food delivery from their preferred joints.The action will take centrestage on February 20 but the Men in Blue have certainly managed to tick the boxes they would have liked during their little preparatory period.","The Indian cricket team have been training at the ICC Academy in Dubai.

Team India undergoes intense training in Dubai ahead of Champions Trophy | Exclusive Visuals

Solid batting lineup (at last)

India’s Champions Trophy 2025 schedule:

India vs Bangladesh on February 20 in Dubai

India vs Pakistan on February 23 in Dubai

India vs New Zealand on March 2 in Dubai

India's Champions Trophy squad:

Rohit Sharma (c), Shubman Gill, Virat Kohli, Shreyas Iyer, KL Rahul, Rishabh Pant, Hardik Pandya, Axar Patel, Washington Sundar, Kuldeep Yadav, Harshit Rana, Mohd. Shami, Arshdeep Singh, Ravindra Jadeja, Varun Chakaravarthy.

NEW DELHI: A year before the 50-over World Cup at home in 2023, India played 30 ODIs in order to find the right balance and the right combination. As a result, India had a near faultless show - up until that forgettable evening in Ahmedabad.With the ICC Champions Trophy in the offing, things are the complete opposite. Chasing a spot in the World Test Championship (WTC) final for a third cycle running, India have played the longest format for the most part. Since losing to Australia in November 2023, India have played just nine ODIs - the fewest of the eight teams that will compete in Pakistan and Dubai. Overall, only Ireland has played fewer matches than India in this period.In the last 12 months, that number has been reduced to just six matches - three in Sri Lanka and three against England at home this month. While Sri Lanka shattered India's series streak over them, India had little trouble romping past England.With few ODIs to go back on, selectors and team management had a tricky time deciding the playing XI versus England. In the first ODI, Harshit Rana played over Arshdeep Singh despite the left-arm seamer being part of the squad. Harshit, however, has made the journey to Dubai since Jasprit Bumrah's injury.The absence of Bumrah with a back injury is arguably the biggest challenge for India going into the Champions Trophy. ""My concern is they [India] are going to miss Jasprit Bumrah, there is no doubt he will be a big absence and I think they will feel it very strongly,"" wrote 2013 Champions Trophy winner Shikhar Dhawan in his column for the ICC.""For me, he is the best bowler in the world, and his accuracy is hard to replicate. He is also a very calm character and that is crucial in a huge ICC event like this,"" he added.How do you find a suitable replacement for the Player of the Tournament in the T20 World Cup and then the Player of the Series in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy? By bringing in the highest wicket-taker from the ODI World Cup, for one.After playing a lengthy will-he-won't-he game on his return from multiple injuries, Mohammed Shami played his first India game in 14 months this January. In the four matches - two T20Is and two ODIs - the returns have been modest. He's posted figures of 0/25, 3/25, 1/38 and 1/66 in the four fixtures. Maybe, more importantly, he hasn't looked to be a fitness casualty. Even though he sported the brace during the nets session in Dubai, the 34-year-old has bowled full tilt without fuss.Yet, there is no clear indication whether he will fill right back into the playing XI or will that place go to Harshit Rana. If form is an indication, the 23-year-old put his name right up the list with 3/33 in the T20I against England and then 3/53 in an ODI versus the same opponents.Dhawan has predicted Rana to have a ""breakout tournament.""""I like his attitude, he is a go-getter and he is not afraid of anything. He accepts challenges and we have seen in the England series that he is in form. I am sure he will look to seize this opportunity and, if he does, he could provide a real x-factor for India,"" stated the southpaw.After some horrible shows with the bat against New Zealand and Australia in the Test matches, India looked like a well-oiled machine against England in the shorter formats. Shubman Gill , who slammed a ton in Ahmedabad, and Shreyas Iyer have been in good form which helps the team take away the dependency on the senior batters in Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli. They, too, found runs in the ODI series. The India skipper produced 119 runs sandwiched between two single digit returns. Kohli, meanwhile, raised his bat after a half century in Ahmedabad.At the top of the order, the Rohit-Gill combination has been a fruitful pairing for India. Since 2023, Rohit and Gill have made 1874 runs as an opening pair in 27 innings, averaging 72.07, including six 100-plus and 11 fifty-plus standsPresence of Hardik Pandya , Ravindra Jadeja, Axar Patel and KL Rahul down the order gives the team the solidity it needs to produce big totals.",India have played just nine ODIs since losing to Australia in November 2023. The absence of Jasprit Bumrah with a back injury is arguably the biggest challenge for India going into the Champions Trophy. Harshit Rana has made the journey to Dubai since the left-arm seamer's injury.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118358462,imgsize-48610,width-400,resizemode-4/118358462.jpg"

Bayern Munich clinched their spot in the Champions League's last 16 with a last-gasp goal against Celtic on Tuesday. The German giants will be joined by Club Brugge and Benfica , who also progressed to the next round. But it wasn't to be for AC Milan , who made a painful exit after a draw with Feyenoord .Bayern, who held a 2-1 advantage from the away leg, struggled to extend their lead at home. Harry Kane came close but struck the crossbar in the first half, while it was the visitors from Scotland who took a surprising lead after 63 minutes when Nicolas Kuehn, who previously played for Bayern, capitalised on Kim Min-jae's defensive error to slot the ball into the bottom corner.That meant the tie was heading for extra time, but Bayern ultimately would not need to go that far as they scored in the fourth minute of injury time.Davies scored from close range to level the match at 1-1, securing Bayern's progression with a 3-2 aggregate victory in the prestigious European competition.The draw scheduled for Friday will reveal whether Kompany's side faces Bayer Leverkusen or Atletico Madrid in the round of 16.Earlier, seven-time European Cup winners Milan were eliminated by Feyenoord, following their 1-1 draw at San Siro. It took the Dutch club through 2-1 on aggregate.Santiago Gimenez, facing his former team after his recent departure, scored from close proximity in the opening minute, bringing Milan level on aggregate.The match took a turn when Milan's Hernandez received his second yellow card early in the second period, resulting in his dismissal. Carranza equalised for Feyenoord with 73 minutes on the clock.In the closing moments, Feyenoord's Read was dismissed with a red card, though his team had already secured their progression in the tie.They now await to face either Inter Milan or Arsenal in the last-16 stage.In Lisbon, Benfica secured their progression despite a 3-3 home draw with Monaco, winning 4-3 on aggregate, setting up a clash with either Barcelona or Liverpool.The Portuguese side, who had secured a 1-0 away victory in the previous week, strengthened their position when Kerem Akturkoglu found the net halfway through the opening period.Monaco mounted a strong response as Takumi Minamino and Eliesse Ben Seghir scored before and after the interval, bringing the aggregate score level.Vangelis Pavlidis converted from the spot, marking his seventh goal in six Champions League appearances, levelling the match at 2-2, before Monaco's substitute George Ilenikhena responded with another goal.However, the tie swung decisively back towards Benfica as Orkun Kokcu made it 3-3 on the night in the 84th minute.Young sensation Chemsdine Talbi netted twice to help Club Brugge secure a 3-1 away win against Atalanta in Italy, sealing a comprehensive 5-2 aggregate victory.Following Talbi's double, Ferran Jutgla added a brilliant goal as the Belgian side built upon their 2-1 home advantage from the previous week's first leg. They will now face either Lille or Aston Villa in the round of 16.Despite Atalanta's 29 shots at goal, they fell victim to counter-attacks from the visitors, with Ademola Lookman's goal early in the second half providing little comfort.Lookman missed from the penalty spot and Atalanta skipper Rafael Toloi received a red card in the closing stages, leading to Atalant's elimination.","Bayern Munich secure their place in the Champions League's last 16 with a last- gasp goal against Celtic on Tuesday.

Australian cricket star Steve Smith has expressed confidence that spinner Matt Kuhnemann will pass all tests on his bowling action, stating he was ""surprised"" when told the left-armer had been reported.Kuhnemann is set to undergo biomechanical testing within the next 10 days after match officials raised concerns about his action during the second Test against Sri Lanka. Despite this, Smith remains optimistic about the outcome.""It's come as a bit of a surprise to me,"" Smith said. ""He has been playing for eight years in professional cricket and nothing has been said in that amount of time. I am thinking of him, at present, he has to go through the process. We're confident he will pass. He will go through that process back home, we wish him all the best.""Australian officials have been reserved about the specifics of Kuhnemann’s assessment, but it is expected to take place in Brisbane. The 28-year-old will undergo hours of testing, with markers attached to his arm and cameras monitoring whether his elbow extension stays within the ICC’s permitted 15-degree limit.Despite the report, Kuhnemann is still eligible to play domestic cricket and is set to feature for Tasmania in the Sheffield Shield. However, ICC rules prohibit him from participating in international matches until he is cleared.The decision to flag Kuhnemann’s action has left Australian players and officials puzzled, given that he has played 124 professional matches since 2017 without any prior concerns. The left-arm spinner has previously represented Australia in ODIs against Sri Lanka in 2022 and in Tests against India in 2023, before starring with 16 wickets at 17.18 in the recent Test series win in Galle.Smith revealed that he only learned of Kuhnemann being cited after Australia’s series-clinching win in Galle and did not notice anything unusual in the spinner’s action.Sri Lankan players had reportedly raised concerns about Kuhnemann’s action during the series, prompting umpires to refer him to the ICC. However, Sri Lanka's spin bowling coach, Piyal Wijetunge, defended Kuhnemann, suggesting that the doubts arose due to his distinctive wrist action rather than any illegal movement.If Kuhnemann's action is deemed illegal, he will face a tight deadline to rectify it before Australia's three-Test series against the West Indies in June and July. His availability will also be crucial for Australia's 2027 tour of India, where his left-arm spin could play a key role alongside Nathan Lyon","Matt Kuhnemann set to undergo biomechanical testing within the next 10 days.

Mission Champions Trophy gets underway as Team India lands in Dubai

NEW DELHI: Former India spinner Harbhajan Singh has dismissed the hype around the much-anticipated India-Pakistan clash in the upcoming ICC Champions Trophy , calling it an ""overhyped game"" and predicting that India will dominate their arch-rivals in Dubai on February 23. India, placed in Group A, will face co-hosts Pakistan in their second match of the tournament, which begins on February 19.Harbhajan, speaking on his YouTube channel, pointed to India's superior squad strength and Pakistan’s recent inconsistency to support his claim that the game is unlikely to be competitive. ""This India-Pakistan game is an overhyped game because there is nothing in it. India is a very strong team. Pakistan recently lost against New Zealand while playing at home. Pakistan is a very inconsistent team, and if you look at their statistics and compare them with Indian batsmen and bowlers, you will get a clear picture,"" he stated.While acknowledging that past performances do not guarantee future results, Harbhajan reiterated his stance that India are far superior. ""When I look at both teams, the difference is very high. India's team looks too strong. Pakistan’s team appears weak apart from Babar [Azam] and [Mohammad] Rizwan. If we talk about Babar and Rizwan, then apart from them, no other batsman stands out. Their bowling unit is also not in form.""Harbhajan, however, identified Fakhar Zaman as a key player for Pakistan who could pose a threat to India. ""I have taken out some statistics. Their main batsman, Babar, has an average of 31 against India. A top batsman should have an average around 50. Rizwan has an average of 25 against India. Fakhar is the only opener who has a solid average of 46. He can take the game away from India. But beyond that, their batting does not inspire confidence. Faheem Ashraf’s average is 12.5, and Saud Shakeel’s is just six against India. When I look at that batting lineup, I do not feel confident that this team can fight against India.""The former cricketer also pointed out that most of India's key players are in strong form ahead of the tournament. ""India is very strong. Rohit [Sharma] has just scored runs, [Shubman] Gill has scored runs, Axar Patel is in form. [Virat] Kohli recently scored a fifty. Although he is not in the form we are used to seeing, I believe he will succeed because he always performs in big tournaments. KL Rahul’s form is also good.""Harbhajan further compared the teams’ recent performances, emphasising that India’s bowling attack is in good rhythm. ""If we look at our bowlers, their form is good. We recently defeated England in a home series, while Pakistan lost to New Zealand at home. New Zealand will play Pakistan in their opening match, and I think New Zealand will defeat them once again because they know how to bat first and set a strong total. Pakistan won an ODI series in Australia, which should have given them confidence, but they have not looked different since. Rizwan’s captaincy is good, his intent is good, but maybe the players they have are not strong enough. Babar has not scored runs, and although Rizwan and Salman Agha have hit centuries here and there, the team does not inspire confidence. Even in Pakistan, their former players say that India is far ahead.""He also touched on the high ticket prices for the match, suggesting that fans may not get the competitive encounter they expect. ""The prices of tickets have increased a lot, but I don't think the game will be as exciting as people are expecting. In this overhyped game on February 23, I think it will be a one-sided game.""Looking beyond the marquee clash, Harbhajan expressed his belief that India are strong contenders to win the tournament and also praised Afghanistan as a potential dark horse. ""India is far ahead in this match-up and is a very capable team that can win this Champions Trophy. The other team I think will play very well in this tournament is Afghanistan, as they will thrive in these conditions.""India will be aiming to capture their third Champions Trophy title, while Pakistan, the defending champions from the 2017 edition, will look to prove their critics wrong. However, according to Harbhajan Singh, the gap between the two teams is simply too large for an upset to happen.","Harbhajan Singh has dismissed the hype around the much-anticipated India- Pakistan clash in the upcoming ICC Champions Trophy.

Feel of the ball

Mission Champions Trophy gets underway as Team India lands in Dubai

Arshdeep's zen mode

About fifteen minutes before the team bus was parked outside the ICC Academy in Dubai, Virat Kohli went to the local manager and made some requests. The manager patiently heard the star batter and walked to the main entrance. When he returned, there was a big paper bag from a popular food joint which had few boxes of Kohli's post-session meal. While the others packed their kit bags after more than three hours of intense training, Kohli was refueling and even saved a box for the road.It was the Indian cricket team's first hit ahead of the Champions Trophy and the side hit the ground less than 12 hours after landing in Dubai on February 15. The session started with a unique drill where a tennis ball was hit way up into the air and a player, with the helmet on, had to rebound it off his head and one of the surrounding fielders were waiting to catch it to earn a point. Some points and lots of fun and games later, serious business got underway.Kohli was one of the first batters to scratch the popping crease and he had Rohit Sharma and Hardik Pandya for company in the adjacent nets. One had just throwdowns, the other featured quicks Arshdeep Singh and Mohammed Shami while the corner-most was the spin net with Ravindra Jadeja, Axar Patel and Kuldeep Yadav bowling. Pandya went bang-bang and Shreyas Iyer continued with similar approach as fireworks were underway when the two were batting. ""Watch the ball, watch it, ball incoming,"" the support staff kept screaming warnings for the security personnel and media near the ropes as the big hits didn't stop.The adjacent nets were quiet on that front as both Kohli and Rohit were happy to get a feel of the ball. There weren't many deliveries in that outside-off channel to Kohli as the right-hander was mostly fed the stump line. Some creaming flicks, on-drives and lofted drives later, he grew in confidence and even showcased his range off the back-foot. The crisp pulls and slashes square off the wicket were on display as he batted for close to an hour. Similarly, Rohit was happy to feel the middle of the blade and was even tested on a few occasions by Arshdeep Singh's incoming deliveries and the occasional yorker.Throughout the session, the intensity from both the batters and bowlers didn't drop an inch as Arshdeep and Shami bowled for close to an hour at full tilt, and the batters were at it even while taking turns on different surfaces. Head coach Gautam Gambhir was stationed right behind the nets as action unfolded and there was a moment of concern in the afternoon when Rishabh Pant was doing his wicketkeeping drills. Pandya slash hit Pant on the left knee and he was down on the ground the next moment.The physios and medical team rushed to give him immediate attention as he grimaced in pain. It was the same knee which received a lot of damage during the horrific accident few years back and immediate ice treatment was necessitated by the blow with Pant flat on the ground. Some time later, he was up on his feet and limped towards the rope before he was interrupted by Pandya who checked on him and gave a hug. After some more treatment, Pant had his knee heavily strapped.All this while, Pant continued to smile and to everyone's surprise started padding up for a hit. He limped to the nets but that didn't affect his big hitting. The left-hander batted without any visible discomfort but he was limped when he made his way back to the change room. The limping continued when he boarded the team bus as well but the smile never left his face. Pant as usual!Something unusual, however, happened towards the end of the session as Arshdeep, after a really long spell, switched to zen mode when he took a book out and started reading. Others around him continued to be chatty and noisy but the youngster was so engrossed in his book that he only left the chair when the manager signalled the players to start walking to the bus.On expected lines, a massive crowd had assembled to catch a glimpse of their favourite stars and Kohli had to momentarily ditch his food box to sign autographs for the waiting fans who created a buzzing atmosphere before the team could finally make their way back to the hotel.","Team India hit the ground less than 12 hours after landing in Dubai on February 15.

India’s squad for ICC Champions Trophy, 2025:

Late in the afternoon on February 15, an unusual frenzy gripped the business class arrivals lounge of the Dubai International Airport. The word had travelled that the Indian cricket team was going to land shortly and plenty of fans had assembled to catch a glimpse of their favourite superstars. The area which generally sees passengers quietly make their way to the fleet of luxury vehicles waiting outside was buzzing with activity.Security officials were working overdrive when the flight carrying the Men in Blue landed on the runway. Few luggage trolleys were used to cordon off the area and the intensity picked up when the local police directed everyone to vacate the lounge area and head to the parking lot outside. There were loud cheers when head coach Gautam Gambhir led the entourage to the team bus. Everyone - from Virat Kohli to Hardik Pandya to Shreyas Iyer - acknowledged the fans while boarding the team bus.When the players took their respective seats, the waiting fans kept looking inside because captain Rohit Sharma was yet to exit the building. And when he did, there were loud cheers for the Hitman who walked briskly to the waiting bus and even summoned the security official for some instructions. Did he forget something again? Eh, not quite sure but you never know! The bus left the airport and KL Rahul, who made his way out at least 20 minutes after the team, took a separate car to the team hotel.Business as usual resumed after that and the usual calm was restored to the business class arrivals lounge. The ICC Champions Trophy 's first match in Dubai is still some days away and the buzz has naturally been missing in the city. And quite understandably so. Only India would be parked here because the rest of the teams will play their matches in Pakistan, the official hosts of the tournament. The teams allotted fixtures vs India will travel to Dubai and then head back as per the hybrid arrangement okayed by the International Cricket Council (ICC).The tournament gets underway on February 19 with India playing their opening match vs Bangladesh in Dubai on February 20. The large section of Bangladeshis residing here are excited to see their heroes in action and sound very optimistic on their chances too. The only question on their lips is ""when will the Bangladesh team land?"" and they certainly sound confident of taking a Jasprit Bumrah-less India down in their tournament opener.""I support Bangladesh and want them to win. It will be difficult but easier than before because Jasprit Bumrah , the dangerman, is not here. And we have good pacers. So it will not be an easy game for India as pacers do well in Dubai,"" said a cab driver who makes multiple trips to the airport in a day.""Pakistan is 50-50. They can do anything on their day but when it's not their day, they are a difficult team to even watch on TV (laughs),"" he added on the hosts' chances.Pakistan, the defending champions, will put their credentials to the test in the opener against New Zealand in Karachi.Rohit Sharma (Captain), Shubman Gill (Vice-captain), Virat Kohli, Shreyas Iyer, KL Rahul (WK), Rishabh Pant (WK), Hardik Pandya, Axar Patel, Washington Sundar, Kuldeep Yadav, Harshit Rana, Mohd.

Mission Champions Trophy gets underway as Team India lands in Dubai

NEW DELHI: Former India pacer Laxmipathy Balaji has backed Mohammed Shami to lead India's pace attack with distinction at the ICC Champions Trophy , set to begin on February 19 in Karachi. With India set to play all their matches in Dubai, Balaji believes Shami's experience and skill will be crucial to the team's success.""Actually, he had out-bowled Bumrah in the 2019 (50-over World Cup) and in the last World Cup (2023). Bumrah is the champion bowler across formats. But Shami has experience and, before Bumrah's arrival, it was Shami who carried India's attack all through,"" Balaji, now a reputed pace bowling coach, told PTI.With Jasprit Bumrah unavailable, Shami will have an added responsibility to make early breakthroughs. Balaji underlined the importance of a strong start with the new ball.""I think it's very important. If India has to do well, then Shami has to come good with the new ball. The kind of impact he can make in his first six overs with the new ball will play a crucial role for India. The old ball is anyway... it is a defensive game now. If he can make early inroads regularly, that will give a huge booster to India,"" he added.Concerns have been raised over Shami's rhythm following his ankle injury, but Balaji expressed confidence in his ability to regain his optimal bowling speed.""Since that (ankle) injury has happened, there was a little bit of slowness, maybe. It's natural. But there is nothing you can do about it. It's part of any sportsperson's career. He has the experience to get over it, and he will do it as he bowls more. It's just about accepting the (physical) condition and continuing his best practices,"" he said.Shami's role in the tournament will extend beyond taking wickets, as he will also have to mentor younger pacers like Arshdeep Singh and Harshit Rana . Balaji emphasised that Shami's extensive experience makes him an ideal leader.""Shami is the leader of the pack right now. I mean, he has been the leader of the pack for a long time now. If you see what Shami has done in 12 years of cricket and, especially, in Test cricket, it has been humongous. Now, if he starts striking with the new ball, the confidence it gives to other bowlers will be huge,"" he said.Dubai, where India will play their matches, has historically provided some assistance to pacers. Balaji feels this could work in Shami's favour.""He keeps attacking the stumps, a quality that is very critical in a place like Dubai, where batsmen may get a little bit more assistance,"" said Balaji.Elaborating on Shami's effectiveness with the new ball, Balaji pointed out the key strengths that make him a formidable bowler.""Shami has one of the best wrist positions in the game, helping him bring all of his variations. See, conditions in Dubai will more or less be similar to India, so he just needs to follow his methods there,"" he added.Balaji further explained Shami's ability to generate movement off the pitch, making him a constant threat to batters.""What Shami does is hit the seam and move the ball off the deck. It is dangerous as batsmen will not be able to guess easily which way the ball is going to move. It also brings into the equation the LBWs and clean bowled dismissals. The away movement ensures that the slip cordon too will be in the mix,"" said Balaji.""And he also bowls closer to the stumps, which allows him to explore those subtle angles. So, he will always be among the wickets,"" he added.India will begin their campaign against Bangladesh in Dubai on Thursday, with Shami expected to play a leading role in their quest for Champions Trophy glory.",Former India pacer Laxmipathy Balaji has backed Mohammed Shami to lead India's pace attack at the ICC Champions Trophy.

'Everyone played a part': Captain Rashid Khan as MI Cape Town clinch maiden SA20 title

SA20 showcasing perfect balance between bat and ball: Vernon Philander

NEW DELHI: Dinesh Karthik came in as Jos Buttler's replacement in the Paarl Royals squad ahead of the third season of the SA20 - South Africa's premier T20 competition. On January 11, he made his debut against two-time defending champions Sunrisers Eastern Cape in a milestone moment. 'DK', as he is commonly and popularly known, became the first Indian to feature in the SA20.Unlike the female players, Board of Control for Cricket in India ( BCCI ) has a strict rule on Indian players plying their trade in foreign T20 leagues. In order to retain exclusivity for the Indian Premier League (IPL), male players cannot play in T20 leagues abroad. The exception, however, is made when the player announces retirement from international cricket and the IPL.Karthik fit that bill after playing his last for Royal Challengers Bengaluru in IPL 2024. After 257 IPL matches in which he scored 4842 runs, DK decided to say goodbye for good. He decided to make a U-turn because of the competition and the lure of playing for the Royals.Now with the season wrapped up, where Paarl Royals bowed out after Qualifier 2, Karthik admits BCCI's stiff policy is for the betterment of Indian cricket and its players with enough happening at state levels as well to aid youngsters.""I'm a big believer that the IPL should be the crown jewel for BCCI. And it is, at the moment, the crown jewel in world cricket. And for that to maintain its status quo as No. 1, I believe that Indian cricketers shouldn't be allowed unless they're retired,"" he said in a conversation organised by SA20.""Because they can take the call if they feel they're done with the IPL and then move on to play other leagues. I completely stand with the BCCI on that front. I agree you can always argue saying 'Can youngsters be given an opportunity?' But I think there is enough in India in terms of competition and ways of being financially secure. And if you're good enough, IPL is a great platform. They have domestic cricket and all the state franchise leagues as well.""So I think there's a lot of cricket that's played in India. And I think cricketers from India should be allowed to play once they retire. And I believe that is the right way to go. And I think SA20, or any other league for that matter, will be more than happy to work with and to have a couple of the players who have retired from BCCI and from playing for India,"" he added.Karthik played 11 matches in the season for Paarl Royals and scored 130 runs at an average of 21.67 and strike rate of 121.50 in a season that saw scarcity of runs under tough pitches. Enough that Royals set a record of bowling their entire 20 overs against Pretoria Capitals with spinners - an aspect that brought out a chuckle from DK who compared the conditions at Boland Park to Tamil Nadu.He might not have set the scoring charts ablaze but did have a jolly time in South Africa with family in tow - especially at the 10,000 capacity Boland Park.""IPL (and SA20) had one thing in common - the fact that there were full houses for all games that I played. So Paarl is well supported, but you have to understand the numbers are very different. South Africa had packed houses, almost all the games that we played, which was very encouraging,"" he said.""Standard of cricket is very good. Obviously, with IPL, the challenges are very different. The quality in terms of how it is played over two months is very, very different to SA20.""Paarl Royals (and eventual champions MI Cape Town) went unbeaten in the league stage with five wins in five played. While MICT went all the way, Royals stumbled against the Sunrisers Eastern Cape. Yet, it was a memorable debut season for Karthik who shared the dressing room with England's Joe Root.""Playing with Joe Root was one of the highlights, I believe, for me personally, playing this tournament. I've never interacted much with him. Always seen him - said a hello, but to rub shoulders with him, be with him in the same dressing room, what a terrific personality. He's a legend of the game. Easily will go down as one of the greatest batters to have ever played this sport.""But the attitude that he brings, it's just very warm, welcoming, helps the youngsters so much. And always wants to have fun and a laugh. And wants the team to have a great time. Like we had this pushups contest after a match. And it was all started by him. It's just the energy that he brings, the genuinity that he brings towards the sport. It was wonderful playing with him. It was one of the best experiences, actually, playing with such a legend who has no hang-ups about himself. Very relaxed, very humble. It was a lot of fun,"" stated Karthik who acknowledged he would be keen on being part of the SA20 again in the future.",Dinesh Karthik is the first Indian to feature in South Africa's premier T20 competition.

Mission Champions Trophy gets underway as Team India lands in Dubai

Former Australian skipper Michael Clarke has backed India captain Rohit Sharma to be the leading run-scorer in the upcoming ICC Champions Trophy , which kicks off on February 19 in Karachi. India have been placed in Group A alongside Pakistan, New Zealand, and Bangladesh. The Men in Blue begin their campaign on February 20 against Bangladesh in Dubai.Rohit Sharma returned to top form during the recent three-match ODI series against England, notching up a century in the second ODI. The 37-year-old Indian captain faced significant scrutiny following a poor Test series against Australia but silenced critics with a commanding hundred.""Well, I am saying India is going to win (Champions Trophy). I am going to go with their captain, who's back in form. I am going to say Rohit Sharma — leading run scorer in the tournament,"" Clarke stated on the latest episode of Beyond23 Cricket Podcast.""It's good to see him making runs again. I think India need him for sure,"" he added.Clarke also predicted that England’s Jofra Archer would emerge as the tournament’s top wicket-taker, despite expecting England to underperform in the Champions Trophy. England are in Group B alongside Australia, South Africa, and Afghanistan.""I want to go with Jofra Archer — leading wicket-taker. I know England; I am not expecting them to do that well, but I think he's a superstar. I think Jofra is going to be really hard to play. So, I am going to have him as my leading wicket-taker,"" Clarke mentioned.The 2015 World Cup-winning captain further picked Australian opener Travis Head as the Player of the Tournament. While he expects Australia to reach the final, he does not see them lifting the trophy.""I am going to go with Travis Head (for Player of the Tournament). Travis Head has been in terrific form. His IPL form was phenomenal. Australian Test summer form was phenomenal. He has had a bit of a break in Sri Lanka. He is ready to go again. So, I am going to say Travis Head Player of the Tournament even though I think Australia might lose the final,"" Clarke concluded.","Michael Clarke has backed India captain Rohit Sharma to be the leading run- scorer in the upcoming ICC Champions Trophy.

NEW DELHI: The United States successfully defended the lowest-ever total of 122 in a non-curtailed ODI match, defeating Oman by 57 runs in their Cricket World Cup League 2 encounter.This total stands as one of the lowest successfully defended scores in men's ODIs, excluding matches with a revised target or reduced overs.In conditions heavily favoring spin bowling , Nosthush Kenjige 's metronomic left-arm spin led the American charge, claiming an impressive 5/11 from 7.3 overs to dismiss Oman for a paltry 65.Milind Kumar's off-spin (2/17) claimed the crucial wicket of Oman captain Jatinder Singh (7), while Harmeet Singh (1/25) and Yasir Mohammed (2/10) complemented Kenjige's efforts.The surface at the Oman Cricket Academy, which had shown more pace in previous years, particularly during the 2021 T20 World Cup, has favored slower bowlers in the recent ODI tri-series, which forms part of the Cricket World Cup 2027 qualification process.Notably, not a single over of pace was bowled in the match, with Oman's five-pronged spin attack matched by the USA's Milind Kumar, Harmeet Singh, Yasir Mohammad, and Kenjige.After electing to bowl first, hoping to emulate their spin success against Namibia two days prior, Oman's bowlers stifled the USA's batting lineup, with skipper Monank Patel (0) being one of five batters to fall inside the first 13 overs.Aaron Jones (16) and Sanjay Krishnamurthi (16) put up a fight, but it was Milind (47*) who carried the innings, hitting six boundaries to push the score past three figures.The Americans were bowled out for 122 in 35.3 overs, with Shakeel Ahmad's 3/20 being the best figures for Oman.However, their spin quartet's efforts overshadowed the hosts' bowling performance, as the USA successfully defended their low total, dismissing Oman for 65, their lowest score in men's international cricket.","The United States successfully defended the lowest-ever total of 122 in a non- curtailed ODI match, defeating Oman by 57 runs in their Cricket World Cup League 2 encounter.

Ireland 240 (A. Balbirnie 64, L. Tucker 61, H. Tector 51; R. Ngarava 2-42, T. Gwandu 2-44) v Zimbabwe 246-1 (B. Curran 118 not out, C. Ervine 69 not out, B. Bennett 48)

Result: Zimbabwe win by nine wickets

Series: Zimbabwe win 2-1

NEW DELHI: Ben Curran struck a career-best 118* to lead Zimbabwe to a commanding nine-wicket victory over Ireland in Harare on Tuesday, sealing a 2-1 series triumph.The 28-year-old, son of former Zimbabwe cricketer Kevin Curran and brother of England internationals Tom and Sam Curran, showcased a remarkable turnaround in form.Facing 112 balls, his unbeaten knock included 14 fours, making him the first Curran family member to score an international century. His previous highest ODI score was just 28.Curran reached his maiden century in the 36th over, driving off-spinner Andy McBrine for a boundary. Zimbabwe comfortably chased down Ireland’s 240/6, finishing at 246/1 with 63 balls to spare, despite a brief 30-minute rain delay.""Congratulations to Ben for a magnificent innings. I had a feeling we were due for a performance like this,"" said Zimbabwe captain Craig Ervine . ""There is a lot of talent in this squad, and this win proves that.""Opening with Brian Bennett (48), Curran put on a solid 126-run stand before Bennett was trapped LBW by Graham Hume . Ervine then joined Curran, playing a blistering knock of 69 off 59 balls, including three sixes and five fours, adding an unbroken 122-run partnership to seal the victory.The win was a morale booster for Zimbabwe, who had suffered home series defeats against Pakistan and Afghanistan.Earlier, Ireland struggled after losing captain Paul Stirling for nine, caught at cover off Richard Ngarava. Curtis Campher (11) also fell cheaply before Andy Balbirnie (64) and Harry Tector (51) steadied the innings with an 86-run stand.However, Balbirnie was dismissed after mistiming a shot to midwicket, and Tector fell soon after attempting an aggressive stroke. Wicketkeeper Lorcan Tucker (61) was the third Irish batter to register a half-century, but his innings ended when he lost his stumps attempting a wild swing.Zimbabwe’s dominant run chase ensured a convincing series victory, marking a significant resurgence for the hosts in white-ball cricket.","Zimbabwe beat Ireland by nine wickets to win series 2-1.

Team India arrives for practice amid loud cheers for Virat Kohli, Rohit Sharma, Hardik Pandya | EXCLUSIVE VISUALS

NEW DELHI: Australian cricket legend Ricky Ponting has expressed his preference for Arshdeep Singh over Harshit Rana as a replacement for the injured Jasprit Bumrah in India's opening match of the Champions Trophy against Bangladesh.Ponting's recommendation comes despite Rana's commendable performance ahead of the ICC event, citing Arshdeep's superior ability to bowl during all phases of a 50-over match.According to Ponting, Arshdeep's skills, particularly with the new ball and in death overs, closely match those of Bumrah, which India will miss.""I would go with the left-armer and I'd go with Arshdeep (to replace Bumrah),"" Ponting told The ICC Review.""We know how good he's been in T20 cricket and if you think about the skill set, he probably provides a similar skill set to what Bumrah does with new ball and death overs and that's what India will miss. That's taking nothing away from Harshit Rana because I think he has got a lot of talent and we know what he can do with the new ball, but I don't think his death skills are as good as what Arshdeep Singh's are.""Ponting also highlighted the strategic advantage of having a left-arm fast bowler in the team, emphasizing their importance in big tournaments, especially against predominantly right-handed batting line-ups.""And just that left-arm variation, someone that can bowl left-arm with a new ball and move the new ball. We know how important they are and crucial they can be, especially in big tournaments when you've got a lot of right-handers at the top. I would personally lean that way if I was India,"" Ponting explained.He also noted the positive signs for India, with key players like Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli regaining form in the recent ODI series against England, and Shreyas Iyer's performance strengthening the middle order.""It's great to see Shreyas Iyer back in the team and playing well in the middle order. He was great,"" he added.""More importantly for India, (Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli) were back scoring runs and that's what they need going into big tournaments. Rohit, Virat, your experienced players, you need them to stand up in the big tournaments in the big moments. So, everything for India right now, with the exception of the loss of Bumrah, everything else looks in good order.""",Australian cricket legend Ricky Ponting has expressed his preference for Arshdeep Singh over Harshit Rana as a replacement for the injured Jasprit Bumrah.

Brief scores: Kerala 418/7 in 177 overs (Mohammed Azharudeen 149 not out; Arzan Nagwaswalla 3/64).

NEW DELHI: Mohammed Azharudeen ’s resilient 149* — his first century in red-ball cricket in seven years — propelled Kerala to a formidable 418 for 7 at stumps on Day 2 of their Ranji Trophy semifinal against Gujarat in Ahmedabad on Tuesday.Resuming at 206 for 4, Kerala suffered an early setback as skipper Sachin Baby , who was unbeaten on 69 overnight, departed without adding to his tally. Left-arm pacer Arzan Nagwaswalla struck on the second ball of the day to remove him, briefly putting Gujarat in control.However, a determined 149-run partnership between Azharudeen and Salman Nizar (52 off 202) helped Kerala recover and cross the 350-run mark.Azharudeen, who started the day on 30, batted through the entire day, facing 303 balls for his unbeaten 149, which included 17 boundaries, mostly through the off-side. This knock marked only his second First-Class century since making his Ranji debut in 2015.Nagwaswalla remained Gujarat’s standout bowler, picking up three wickets, including the late dismissal of Ahammed Imran (24), who had frustrated the hosts with a 40-run stand alongside Azharudeen.Despite Kerala’s strong position, their cautious approach on a batting-friendly surface raised eyebrows. Having scored 206 runs on Day 1, they managed only 212 on the second day, allowing Gujarat a chance to fight back.With a first-innings lead now in sight, Kerala will aim to bat as long as possible on Day 3, while Gujarat must produce a strong batting display to regain control in the semifinal clash.","Mohammed Azharudeen scores 149* as Kerala reach 418 for 7 at stumps on Day 2 of their Ranji Trophy semifinal against Gujarat in Ahmedabad on Tuesday.

NEW DELHI: Left-arm spinner Parth Rekhade turned the game on its head with a stunning three-wicket burst in an over, leaving Mumbai reeling at 188 for 7 in response to Vidarbha ’s first-innings total of 383 on Day 2 of the Ranji Trophy semifinal in Nagpur on Tuesday.Trailing by 195 runs at stumps, Mumbai’s title defence was under serious threat as they faced a disciplined Vidarbha bowling attack at the VCA Stadium .Opener Akash Anand stood firm with an unbeaten 67, battling at one end, while Tanush Kotian (5*) was the last recognised batter at the crease, trying to salvage Mumbai’s innings.At one stage, Mumbai appeared steady at 113 for 2, but Rekhade, playing just his second First-Class match, triggered a dramatic collapse. His first breakthrough came in the 41st over when an innocuous delivery saw Ajinkya Rahane (18) drag the ball back onto his stumps.Two balls later, Suryakumar Yadav (0) fell victim to a sharp catch at silly point by Danish Malewar after a hard-handed defensive prod. A couple of deliveries later, Shivam Dube (0) was dismissed in similar fashion, caught for a two-ball duck as Mumbai crumbled from 113/2 to 113/5 in no time.The slide continued as Shams Mulani fell leg-before to Harsh Dubey, reducing Mumbai to 118/6. However, Anand and Shardul Thakur attempted a rescue act, stitching together a crucial 60-run partnership.Thakur, known for his fighting knocks, played a counterattacking 37 off 41 balls, laced with four boundaries and a six. Just as he looked set for a bigger contribution, he fell to a well-directed short ball from Yash Thakur, who had earlier dismissed Siddhesh Lad (35) to break a vital second-wicket stand.Mumbai had a shaky start to their innings, with opener Ayush Mhatre departing early, caught at cover by Malewar. Lad and Anand then steadied the innings, but Vidarbha’s relentless attack ensured that Mumbai remained under pressure.Earlier in the day, Vidarbha added 75 runs to their overnight total of 308/5, with Rathod reaching his half-century before falling for 54 off 113 balls, striking seven boundaries. Despite his efforts, Vidarbha could not push beyond 383, but their bowlers ensured they remained in control of the contest.With Mumbai still trailing significantly and only three wickets in hand, Vidarbha holds the upper hand heading into Day 3.","Mumbai trail Vidarbha by 195 runs at stumps on Day 2 of Ranji Trophy semifinal in Nagpur.

NEW DELHI: Pakistan's star batter Babar Azam has been honoured with the ICC Men's T20I Team of the Year 2024 cap, just ahead of the Champions Trophy.The 31-year-old prolific batter was named in the prestigious team last month for his outstanding performances in the shortest format. On the eve of Pakistan's tournament opener against New Zealand, the ICC shared a video on Instagram capturing the moment Babar received his cap.""The ICC T20I Team of the Year 2024 cap fits perfectly on Babar Azam,"" the ICC captioned the post.Babar had a stellar run in 2024, scoring 738 runs in 24 matches, including six half-centuries. Renowned for his consistency and elegant stroke play, he remained the backbone of Pakistan’s batting lineup throughout the year.He kicked off 2024 with three consecutive fifties against New Zealand and continued to thrive under pressure, reaffirming his status as one of the world’s finest T20I batters.With his dominance established in T20Is, Babar now sets his sights on making an impact in ODIs as Pakistan begin its Champions Trophy campaign in Karachi on Wednesday.Leading up to the marquee event, Pakistan struggled to find momentum in the ODI tri-nation series against New Zealand and South Africa.

Arne Slot confident Liverpool can handle Premier League title race pressure,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/epl/top-stories/arne-slot-confident-liverpool-can-handle-premier-league-title-race-pressure/articleshow/118356270.cms,"Arne Slot. (Liverpool FC Photo)

Liverpool boss Arne Slot insists his side can cope with the mounting pressure of the Premier League title race despite showing signs of nerves in their tense 2-1 win over Wolves.The Reds travel to Aston Villa on Wednesday, knowing a victory will extend their lead to 10 points over second-placed Arsenal as they push for a record-equalling 20th English title.However, Liverpool have looked less assured in recent weeks. They nearly squandered a two-goal lead against Wolves and had already suffered a late collapse in the Merseyside derby when Everton’s James Tarkowski scored a stoppage-time equaliser. Their recent FA Cup exit at the hands of second-tier Plymouth has only added to concerns that the treble chasers may be feeling the pressure.Left-back Andrew Robertson admitted nerves were natural as the finish line approaches, but Slot pointed to Liverpool’s ability to grind out tight wins as proof they won’t buckle.“This is happening because we are nearing the end of the season, not because of us, but because of what people make of it,” Slot said on Tuesday. “We have won plenty of games by just one goal, home and away. I remember Crystal Palace away when it was tight in the end. If this happens now, people talk about nerves. But securing a win in the Premier League, especially at 1-0, always involves hard work and defending.”Adding to Liverpool’s challenge is Arsenal’s remarkable 15-match unbeaten run in the league since their last defeat at Newcastle on November 2.Several Liverpool players have prior title race experience from their 2020 Premier League triumph under Slot’s predecessor, Jurgen Klopp. Slot himself successfully managed pressure when leading Feyenoord to the Dutch title. However, he remains cautious about overvaluing past experiences.“We lean on the players. They have to show up and perform,” he said. “We don’t hold meetings on how to handle pressure—it doesn’t work that way. Experience helps, but we shouldn’t overvalue it. The ones who won the league here last time did it in the COVID era with no fans, and at one point, they were 25 points ahead. That’s hardly pressure.”Slot acknowledges that Aston Villa, who boast a formidable home record, pose a serious challenge for Liverpool.“When you see the fixture list, Villa away is one of the toughest you can face. They have a very good manager with a strong game plan,” Slot said.Despite not being at their best against Wolves, Slot believes that grinding out a win after the disappointment against Everton was crucial.“These are the games you must win if you want to achieve something. We didn’t play our best, but we fought until the end.

Tottenham Hotspur secured a narrow 1-0 victory against Manchester United on Sunday, dealing another disappointing result to Red Devils' manager Ruben Amorim. A solitary goal from James Maddison in the 13th minute propelled Spurs above United to 12th position, marking their third triumph over United this season.The win provided relief for Tottenham's manager Ange Postecoglou, who had faced criticism following recent eliminations from domestic cup competitions and poor league performance. United slipped to 15th position, though maintaining a comfortable 12-point gap from the relegation zone.""The place in the table is my worry, I am not worried about me,"" said Amorim, who has managed just four victories in 14 Premier League matches since his November appointment. ""I hate to lose. That feeling is the worst. The rest I am not thinking about. I understand my situation, my job, I am confident in my work and I just want to win games.""Tottenham's first home league victory since November occurred amidst supporter unrest. Fans expressed their dissatisfaction towards ENIC and chairman Daniel Levy through protests before and after the match. A prominent banner stated ""24 years, 16 managers, 1 trophy - Time for change"" as supporters demanded Levy's departure.Postecoglou's squad received a boost with several key players returning from injury. Goalkeeper Guglielmo Vicario made his first appearance since November, whilst Maddison returned to the starting eleven. Destiny Udogie, Brennan Johnson and Wilson Odobert were available as substitutes.""They are quality players. We've had it pretty tough the last two-and-a-half months,"" said Postecoglou. ""It was important for us to win and gain some traction. I certainly feel there is still a massive opportunity for us in this back half of the season and hopefully today is the start of that.""United faced their own injury challenges, with Amad Diallo joining Lisandro Martinez as long-term absentees and Kobbie Mainoo sidelined for a month. Amorim's bench included eight teenagers, whilst Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee started upfront.The match saw several chances for both sides. Vicario denied attempts from Hojlund and Alejandro Garnacho, whilst Maddison capitalised on Andre Onana's parry to score. Garnacho missed a clear opportunity before halftime, and Zirkzee failed to convert a promising header later in the match.United's offensive struggles continued, with only the bottom three clubs and Everton scoring fewer than their 28 goals in 25 league matches.

NEW DELHI: Liverpool on Sunday secured a 2-1 victory against Wolves at Anfield, extending their lead at the top of the Premier League to seven points.Luis Diaz ended his goal drought with his first goal in 2025, while Mohamed Salah continued his impressive form as Liverpool bounced back from a disappointing week.The Colombian forward scored his 13th goal of the season after going 10 games without finding the net.Salah's penalty conversion before halftime marked his 28th goal across all competitions this season.Wolves' Matheus Cunha scored in the second half, but Liverpool managed to hold on despite showing signs of fatigue in a tense finish.Liverpool's previous two matches resulted in an FA Cup fourth round defeat to Plymouth and a 2-2 draw with Everton.Arsenal's recent 2-0 victory at Leicester had put additional pressure on Liverpool's title pursuit.Liverpool's response moved them closer to potentially securing their 20th English title, which would equal the existing record.With upcoming matches against Aston Villa, Manchester City, and Newcastle in the next 10 days, Liverpool could strengthen their position in the title race.Manager Arne Slot was present despite facing charges for confronting referee Michael Oliver after the Merseyside derby.The incident stemmed from Slot's disagreement over James Tarkowski's stoppage-time equalizer, which he believed should have been disallowed due to a possible foul by Beto on Ibrahima Konate.Slot had urged Liverpool to use their 'anger' from the painful end to the Everton game as fuel to get back on track against Wolves.Diaz opened the scoring in the 15th minute with his first league goal at Anfield since September.The goal came after Diaz found Salah, whose return pass deflected off Toti Gomes. Diaz managed to chest the ball past Wolves goalkeeper Jose Sa.Dominik Szoboszlai nearly added to Liverpool's lead with a low shot that went wide.Jose Sa was forced to save Diogo Jota's attempt following Andy Robertson's cross.Liverpool extended their lead in the 37th minute through Salah's penalty, despite Wolves' protests about a possible push by Diaz on Emmanuel Agbadou.Salah's recent form has been exceptional, with seven goals in his last six appearances.Wolves' new signing Marshall Munetsi missed a clear opportunity early in the second half, with Alisson Becker making a crucial save.A penalty decision for Liverpool was overturned by VAR after replays showed Jota had dived following Agbadou's challenge.Cunha took advantage of Liverpool's declining momentum, scoring with a curling shot past Ryan Gravenberch in the 67th minute.Liverpool persevered through a challenging final period to claim their fourth victory in five league matches.","Liverpool beat Wolves 2-1 to extend their lead at the top of the Premier League to seven points.

Bagan show their might to Blasters,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/indian-super-league/top-stories/bagan-show-their-might-to-blasters/articleshow/118293743.cms,"KOCHI: On Saturday evening, Mohun Bagan Super Giant demonstrated to Kerala Blasters why they are on top of the ISL table. They also proved that superior ball possession and attacking prowess cannot compensate for defensive frailties.Despite Blasters controlling 67% of the possession, Bagan secured a commanding 3-0 victory over the home side at the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium, Kochi, with Jamie MacLaren netting twice (28, 40) and Alberto Rodriguez (66) completing the tally for the visitors.The first 25 minutes of the game were all about Blasters. They mounted one attack after another on the Bagan goal but failed to convert any of their chances into goals. However, the Kolkata giants weathered the storm and scored against the run of play in the 28th minute. Once they found an opening, Bagan knew how to kill the game and did just that.The home side's best chance in the first half came in the 20th minute, but Jesus Jimenez squandered it. A poor backpass inside the box from Bagan's Lalengmawia Ralte was collected by Jimenez. Despite successfully beating the offside trap, the forward's shot sailed high over the crossbar.The architect of Bagan's first goal was Liston Colaco. With a clever move, he outmanoeuvred Luna and delivered the ball from the left to MacLaren inside the box. MacLaren's excellent first touch followed by a powerful left-footed strike thudded into Blasters' net.Bagan nearly doubled their advantage five minutes later as Colaco's curling attempt from the left narrowly missed the target.MacLaren made it 2-0 four minutes before half-time. The sequence began with Vishal Keith's long pass to MacLaren, who cleverly backheeled to Jason Cummings. The UK striker then chipped the ball towards MacLaren, who sprinted past the Blasters' defence and cleverly lobbed it over the advancing Sachin Suresh into the goal. Although MacLaren put the ball in the Blasters' net one more time during first-half stoppage time, the goal was disallowed for offside.Bagan extended the lead in the 66th minute through defender Alberto Rodriguez Martin's strike. Once again, the Blasters defence failed to clear their lines during a set piece. After the initial shot was blocked by the two-man wall, the ball fell before Rodriguez, whose powerful left-footer was enough to beat a diving Sachin Suresh.The defeat has hit Blasters' playoff qualification hopes. They are eighth in the points table with 24 points from 20 matches and trail sixth-placed Mumbai City by seven points. Bagan, having already secured their playoff spot, strengthened their position at the summit with 49 points from 21 matches.","Mohun Bagan beat Kerala Blasters 3-0 at the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium, Kochi.

Real Madrid maintained their top position in La Liga despite a 1-1 stalemate at Osasuna on Saturday, a match marked by Jude Bellingham's dismissal, whilst Atletico Madrid also drew 1-1 against Celta Vigo.The league leaders scored first through Kylian Mbappe , but proceedings took a turn when Bellingham received a red card for dissent near the conclusion of the first period.Osasuna equalised via Ante Budimir's penalty conversion at the 58-minute mark, as the defending champions extended their winless league run to three matches.Despite playing with reduced numbers after Pablo Barrios' early dismissal in the seventh minute, Atletico Madrid stayed within a point of Los Blancos, whilst Barcelona could potentially match Real Madrid's points tally should they triumph over Rayo Vallecano on Monday.Bellingham defended his actions, stating he was merely expressing personal frustration. ""I think you can see clearly in the video, I remember the incident very well, it was an expression to myself,"" he told reporters. ""I'm not even directing myself towards the referee, but obviously there was a misunderstanding. He's believed that I've said (something insulting) to him... There was no intent to insult him, there was no insult.""Carlo Ancelotti, Real Madrid's manager, expressed satisfaction with his team's performance despite the result. ""In a footballing sense we started very well, and we finished well despite having one less player,"" said Ancelotti.The Italian tactician adjusted his lineup considering the upcoming Champions League fixture against Manchester City, resting Rodrygo whilst giving Brahim Diaz a start.Los Blancos dominated early proceedings with swift ball movement, and Mbappe soon converted Fede Valverde's cross, marking his seventh goal in five La Liga appearances.The match shifted when Bellingham received his red card at 39 minutes after an exchange with referee Jose Munuera Montero.Ancelotti defended his player: ""I think with Bellingham's red card (the referee) didn't understand the English well... I don't think it's something offensive. I think the red card came out because the referee was nervous... Bellingham did nothing today to have been sent off, absolutely nothing.""After previous complaints about Spanish officiating, Madrid's frustrations grew in the second half. Osasuna equalised through Budimir's penalty after Camavinga fouled him, bringing the striker's season tally to 13 goals.Mbappe had a final opportunity in stoppage time, but goalkeeper Sergio Herrera made a crucial save.Regarding Atletico's match, Diego Simeone praised his team's resilience: ""The team had gladiators again, playing 90 minutes with one fewer player is very tough,"" whilst acknowledging Barrios' dismissal as correct.Koke reflected on the challenge: ""When we were left with 10 men it's very difficult... the team tried everything. We defended well, we suffered when we had to. Obviously we're still in the fight for the title.""In another fixture, Valencia secured a 1-1 draw at Villarreal in their relegation battle.","Real Madrid held to 1-1 draw by Osasuna in La Liga.

Former US Open winner and

Jessica Pegula

reflect on the suspension of Stefano Vukov, the coach of

Elena Rybakina

Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel.

DUBAI: The Women's Tennis Association's efforts to create a safe environment for players isn't lost on the leading ladies in the Dubai Duty Free tennis championships, but that awareness is delivered with a coordinating conjunction. While they applauded the WTA 's stand in general they refused to comment on the suspension of Stefano Vukov, coach of Elena Rybakina.Coco Gauff ,the third seed at the WTA 1000 event here, steered clear of Vukov's oneyear ban because she knew the 25-year-old was unhappy with the Tour's decision to ban her coach. ""It's nice that the WTA is out there to protect players, I definitely feel protected by them,"" the 20-year-old American said, adding the Tour put up contact information on bathroom stalls in lockerrooms around the world, providing an avenue for players to report abuse anonymously.The 37-year-old Vukov — a former player from Croatia — started working with Rybakina in Febuary 2019. Rybakina, the world No. 7, who opens her campaign here against qualifier Moyuka Uchijima, denied Vukov had ever mistreated her.The Moscow-born Kazakh's game improved rapidly when she teamed with the Croat, her ranking climbing from 191 to the top-40 in less than a year. Rybakina, who won Wimbledon in 2022, quickly became the talking point in tennis circles, not just for her obvious talent and smooth style of play, but also because of Vukov, whose behavior was obviously out of order. A report in The Athletic noted that Vukov had called Rybakina ‘stupid', telling her that without him she would ‘still be in Russia picking potatoes.'Rybakina, who has struggled with her health, especially in the past year, split with Vukov last August, but rehired him in January adding a twist to an already complicated situation. In between she started working with former Wimbledon champion Goran Ivanisevic, who quit her team after the Australian Open. The Kazakh, who says she's still getting coached by Vukov on the phone, is also working with Italian Davide Sanguinetti.""I'm disappointed with the situation, and how the process went,"" Rybakina said of the decision to ban Vukov.Abusive coaches and parents are not new to tennis and the WTA has been quick on the button, famously with Jim Pierce and Damir Dokic, both of who fell in the dads from hell column and faced bans from the Tour.Gauff said, ""That's important in our sport because a lot of times victims don't even know they are victims. It has happened so many times in this sport. You see former players speaking out (on abuse) years after their careers ended.""She added, ""It's a unique sport, you're 14, 15 and out of the country, most of the time you aren't traveling with your parents, so anything can happen.""And sometimes it is the parents who are the problem.

The World Anti-Doping Agency on Monday offered an explanation for why top-ranked tennis player Jannik Sinner received a much shorter doping ban than the six-year suspension it handed to a Spanish figure skater in a similar doping case.Spanish media has been calling attention to the lengthy ban handed to local skater Laura Barquero after she tested positive for the anabolic Clostebol, the same substance that earned Sinner a three-month ban after a settlement reached between WADA and the Italian tennis player on Saturday. The deal was criticised by many of his fellow tennis professionals this weekend.WADA pointed out that while both cases involved the same substance, the specific facts related to Barquero's case were ""very different"" to Sinner's.""The fundamental difference between the two cases is that Ms. Barquero's version of how the substance entered her system was unconvincing in light of the evidence, such that the circumstances remained unknown as far as WADA was concerned,"" WADA said in an email sent to The Associated Press. ""In contrast, in the Sinner case, the evidence clearly confirmed the athlete's explanation as outlined in the first instance decision.""Barquero first tested positive for Clostebol during the 2022 Winter Olympics, then again in January 2023 in an out-of-competition test carried out by the International Skating Union. WADA eventually entered into a ""case resolution agreement"" in which the athlete was suspended for six years. It said the agreement was accepted and signed by WADA, the ISU and the athlete herself.""If Ms. Barquero did not agree with the proposed sanction, she was not obliged to sign the case resolution agreement and was free to take the case forward for hearing at CAS,"" WADA said.The agency had sought to ban Sinner, a three-time Grand Slam champion, for at least one year. It had challenged a decision last year by the International Tennis Integrity Agency not to suspend Sinner for what the ITIA judged was accidental contamination of the banned anabolic steroid last March.WADA formally withdrew its appeal saying it accepted the athlete's explanation for the cause of the violation, and that Sinner did not intend to cheat.Sinner's explanation was that trace amounts of Clostebol in his doping sample was due to a massage from a trainer who used the substance after cutting his own finger.Barquero's Instagram account republished several stories calling attention to the discrepancy in the punishment given to her and to Sinner. She then posted a video talking about how her lengthy suspension had affected her.""It's a disproportionate sanction that meant the end of my career,"" she said. ""I believe it serves as a clear example of the failures of the system. I really don't know what happened. But I have to assume the consequences, accept the current regulations and face sanctions that sometimes are extremely disproportionate.""The 23-year-old Barquero said she decided to accept the six-year ban based on ""unfair rules"" and so she could start moving on with her life.She said the trace amounts of Clostebol showed up in her results through the contamination of a cream commonly used to treat skin wounds that is sold in Italy without prescription and not intended to improve sporting performance.""I had the misfortune of accidentally contaminating myself with a cream that a colleague had bought and that was used by people close to me,"" she said. ""I couldn't imagine that to test positive all you have to do is touch a person who has used that cream, or touch an object that was in contact with the cream.""","Top-ranked tennis player Jannik Sinner received a much shorter doping ban than the six-year suspension it handed to a Spanish figure skater in a similar doping case.

DUBAI: Jessica Pegula threw her arms up in frustration trying to get a handle on the World Anti-Doping Agency 's (WADA) decision to enter into a 'case resolution agreement' with world No.1 Jannik Sinner, who tested positive for Clostebol last March.Pegula, ranked five, speaking on the sidelines of the Dubai Duty Free tennis, a WTA 1000 event, argued that no matter which side of the divide one fell, whether people thought Sinner was guilty or not, ""the process seemed not to be a process"".""Whatever factors they take into consideration they make up their own ruling, I don't really understand how that's fair for athletes, there's just so much inconsistency,"" Pegula said of the agency, which until last week appeared to be pulling for at least a year-long ban.WADA, who lodged an appeal at the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) in September, was initially looking at a period of ineligibility of between one and two years for the Italian. With the date for the appeal of the 'no fault or negligence' ruling of the International Tennis Integrity Agency set for mid-April, WADA tossed a curveball on Saturday, handing the 23-year-old a threemonth suspension that ends on May 4.Sinner, who has maintained he's innocent, saying the drug had entered his system when his physiotherapist, who had used the cream on himself, had subsequently massaged him. ""I have always accepted that I'm responsible for my team, on that basis I have accepted WADA's offer to resolve these proceedings on the basis of a three-month sanction,"" Sinner said in a statement.On the morning after, the bulk of the tennis community questioned WADA's decision, with the likes of the former British No.1 Tim Henman calling the length of the ban, which allows Sinner to return to the Tour in time for the Masters 1000 event in Rome, as convenient.""We get these emails explaining why this happened,"" Pegula, who is part of the WTA Players' Council, said. ""It's like I can give a reason and explain a million different ways to make it sound right. The process is broken, it needs to be seriously considered. They have so much power to ruin someone's career, something needs to be done about that because it seems unfair.""Pegula, whose parents Terry and Kim own the Buffalo Bills (NFL), Buffalo Sabres (NHL) and Buffalo Bandits (Lacrosse), is no stranger to the business of sport. The 30-yearold underlined that the number of players who had trust in the process was ""zero"".""It's a horrible look for the sport when there's so much inconsistency with player rulings,"" she said, ""I don't know what to think. The past couple years there seems to be no rhyme or reason for whatever they decide. So, I'm not really that shocked that there all of a sudden is a settlement.""Aryna Sabalenka, the world no.1 and top seed in Dubai, said the recent positive tests of Sinner and Iga Swiatek had made her wary. ""You start to be more careful,"" the 26-year-old Belarusian said, ""before I wouldn't care, I would leave a glass of water in a restaurant and go to the bathroom. Now I'm not going to drink (from) the same glass. These things get to your head, if someone uses a cream on you and you test positive, they're going to go for you. You become scared of the system.""""I don't see how I can trust the system,"" added Sabalenka.","Jessica Pegula questions World Anti-Doping Agency's decision on Jannik Sinner.

'He was in a lot of pain': Sai Sudharsan admits Rishabh Pant's absence could hurt India

Poll Do you agree with Alastair Cook's concerns about injury substitutions? Yes, it's a valid point No, Vaughan's idea is better I'm neutral on the issue

Former England captain Michael Vaughan on Wednesday called for a tweak in the rules following Rishabh Pant's foot injury, while another ex-England skipper, Alastair Cook , disagreed.Rishabh Pant was retired hurt and went for scans after copping a blow on his right foot while attempting a reverse sweep off England pacer Chris Woakes on the opening day of the fourth Test at Old Trafford.Vaughan said the unfortunate injury had made the balance of the Test uneven.""I don't like the fact that we've got four days left in the game — four days of action in what has been an incredible series — where we are going to have ten versus eleven,"" Vaughan said on Test Match Special.""I prefer that you'd have a sub. You know, once they brought in concussion subs, I was crying out, saying, ‘Well, just have substitutions then in the first innings of a game.’ That would be my stepping point. If it happens in the second innings, I feel that team might kind of break the rules or indulge in a bit of skullduggery.""But if it's clear and obvious — when someone breaks a hand or a foot or ruptures a calf — it's so evident that someone is in real pain and can't carry on. I think it's very clear to me: you should be allowed a sub.""Meanwhile, Alastair Cook disagreed and raised a hypothetical scenario: what if it’s just a bruise?""I’m not sure I agree,"" said Cook.""I’m not even sure what I think at the moment. But say we've just seen Pant walk off — he looks in all kinds of pain. And then it turns out it’s not broken.""So there’s nothing on the X-ray — it’s just a bruise. Does he have to play on then? If he has broken his foot, then that’s a different thing.""But there will be cases where someone gets hit on the arm. ‘I can’t move my hand, I’m bruised.’ But it's only a bruise. So do you get replaced because of discomfort and the fact that you can’t hold the bat as well as you’d like — even though it’s just a bruise?""Pant was batting on 37 off 48 balls at the time. The wicketkeeper-batter first received on-field medical attention but had to be moved off the field in a golf cart labelled as an ambulance.Blood was seen seeping from Pant’s right foot, and the affected area was visibly swollen. More details on his latest injury are awaited.Woakes’ full-length delivery crashed into Pant’s toe, and the England players went up in appeal for leg-before. But a tiny inside edge on review saved the day for Pant.This was Pant’s second injury in the series — he had bruised his finger while keeping during the third Test at Lord’s, which prevented him from guarding the stumps in England’s second innings.","Former England captain Michael Vaughan on Wednesday called for a tweak in the rules following Rishabh Pant's foot injury.

Rishabh Pant suffers right foot injury in India vs England Test; taken off in an ambulance

Poll Do you think Ben Stokes' commitment to bowling long spells is beneficial for the England team? Yes, it inspires the team. No, it could lead to injuries.

'Can’t see him take any further part': Liam Dawson voices concern as Rishabh Pant exits injured

Veteran all-rounder and England captain Ben Stokes etched another chapter in his storied Test career on Day 1 of the fourth Test against India, becoming a symbol of grit and leadership as he bowled more overs in a single series than ever before.With 14 hard-fought overs on Wednesday at Old Trafford, the England skipper took his series tally to 119 overs — surpassing his previous best of 116.5 during the 2013–14 Ashes in Australia.Despite a long history of injuries, including two hamstring setbacks in the past year, the 34-year-old continues to lead England from the front. His 2/47 helped check India’s progress after a solid opening partnership, and reaffirmed his role as England’s tireless engine.""I'm not going to lie, I cannot wait to just lie on my bed for four days,"" Stokes had quipped after the draining Lord’s Test, where he claimed five wickets, scored 77 runs, and was involved in Rishabh Pant ’s run-out.But ahead of the Old Trafford clash, he remained committed: ""If the situation requires it again then I'll do what I need to do.""The England skipper’s commitment has stood in sharp contrast to debates around workload management, especially concerning India’s Jasprit Bumrah Both bowlers have struggled with injuries, but Stokes’ willingness to bowl marathon spells has set the tone for his team.At stumps, India were 264/4, but the bigger talking point was Rishabh Pant’s retirement hurt after being struck on the right foot by a Chris Woakes delivery. His absence could have serious implications for the visitors, who are trailing 1-2 in the five-match series.Ahead of the Manchester Test, comparisons to England’s legendary 2005 Ashes series have surfaced, and Stokes welcomed the noise: “Two teams going toe-to-toe… it’s been great to play in. I presume it’s been great to watch.”","England captain Ben Stokes bowled more overs in a single series than ever before.

Poll Which candidate do you believe has the best chance of improving Indian football? Khalid Jamil Stephen Constantine Stefan Tarkovic

PANAJI: The technical committee of the All India Football Federation (AIFF) has recommended Khalid Jamil as its top choice to fill the national coach vacancy, following the resignation of Manolo Marquez.Should Jamil get the nod from the AIFF’s executive committee, he will become the first Indian as full-time coach since Sukhvinder Singh in 2005. Two other Indians – Armando Colaco and Savio Medeira –held interim charges, following the sacking of Bob Houghton in 2011.“We had lot of applications, and after careful scrutiny, the technical committee has recommended three names to the executive committee,” AIFF’s national team director Subrata Paul told TOI after the technical committee meeting on Wednesday. “We believe in the potential of these three coaches. They can take our national team forward.”Stephen Constantine, hoping for a third stint with the national team after winning four trophies in the past, is the second name on the list, while former Slovakia and Kyrgyzstan coach Stefan Tarkovic has also been shortlisted.“All coaches have their own strong points. Khalid has done extremely well in the I-League and Indian Super League (ISL).Constantine knows Indian football inside out and India played well at the Asian Cup in 2019. Tarkovic has a good national team experience, after stints with Slovakia and Kyrgyzstan,” said another official.The technical committee has backed Jamil for the top job, given his record in domestic football. Despite limited resources, the former India midfielder won the I-League with Aizawl FC, scripting one of Indian football’s most remarkable stories in 2017. He then caught everyone’s attention with semifinal spots in the ISL with NorthEast and Jamshedpur FC, a side he continues to coach.“The AIFF will now speak with the coaches and look at their (salary) demands. If Khalid agrees to the terms, he will get the India job,” said another official.Besides the technical committee, Khalid has also got the backing of Dronacharya Award winners, Armando Colaco and Bimal Ghosh, both of whom were consulted as advisors to AIFF president Kalyan Chaubey.According to sources, Constantine too has support within the committee, chaired by former India captain IM Vijayan. India went from 173 to 97 in FIFA rankings between 2015 and 2018 when Constantine was at the helm of affairs. The English coach, who last managed Pakistan, won four trophies with the national team: LG Cup (2002), SAFF Cup (2015), Tri Nation Series (2017) and Inter-Continental Cup (2018).From the 170 who applied for the national team job, the list was pruned to 20 and presented before the technical committee which met virtually on Wed.

Rishabh Pant suffers right foot injury in India vs England Test; taken off in an ambulance

TimesofIndia.com in Manchester: England all-rounder Liam Dawson expressed concern for Rishabh Pant, who suffered a painful blow to his right foot and was forced to retire hurt on Day 1 of the fourth Test at Old Trafford.“Thoughts with Rishabh Pant, but can’t see him take any further part in the match,” Dawson told reporters after stumps, reflecting the seriousness of the injury.Pant, batting fluently on 37 off 47 balls, was struck while attempting a reverse sweep off Chris Woakes.The ball smashed into his boot, leaving him writhing in pain.England went up in appeal for LBW, but UltraEdge showed a faint under-edge, sparing Pant from dismissal. However, the injury was severe enough to halt his innings.Medical staff rushed onto the field as Pant lay on the ground.There were signs of swelling and bleeding on his right foot, and after initial treatment, he was carried off by the physio before being transported on a medical cart.Later, Pant left the ground in an ambulance, accompanied by the team doctor and support staff. BCCI confirmed he was taken for scans, stating, “Rishabh Pant was hit on his right foot while batting on Day 1 of the Manchester Test.The BCCI Medical Team is monitoring his progress.”India had earlier made a strong start after being put into bat, with KL Rahul (46) and Yashasvi Jaiswal (58) putting together a 94-run opening stand.However, England struck back in the second session with Woakes removing Rahul, Dawson dismissing Jaiswal, and skipper Ben Stokes (2/47) trapping Shubman Gill (12).Sai Sudharsan (61 off 151) anchored the middle order before falling to Stokes. At stumps, Ravindra Jadeja (19 not out) and Shardul Thakur (19 not out) were unbeaten, guiding India to 264/4.Pant’s fitness remains a major talking point ahead of Day 2, with Dhruv Jurel likely to keep wickets if he is ruled out.","Rishabh Pant suffers right foot injury in India vs England Test; taken off in an ambulance.

The moment the ball crashed into the side of his right boot, Rishabh Pant was in serious pain. England went up after their appeal was turned down, and the replays suggested that some bat saved the left-hander after he failed to make a good connection with the audacious reverse-sweep. Pant survived the shout for leg before but couldn't survive the pain, as he struggled to stay still due to the unbearable pain. The moment the boot came off, one could see the swelling as the camera zoomed in on the impact point.The physio gave the initial treatment; there was some blood, but the pain didn't subside as the 27-year-old continued to grimace. The damage was done, and Ravindra Jadeja was getting ready to walk out. But when Pant tried to stand up, he couldn't keep the foot down. A mini-ambulance was summoned to ferry the stumper back to the change room.A solid partnership was developing between Pant and Sai Sudharsan, but the injury allowed England to bring some momentum their way, and they made it count. With light fading, England saw this as the opportunity to have a real crack at the visitors. For the entire day, the hosts were relentless but got a solid response from India in the morning session, where the conditions remained overcast but good for batting.There was some anxious energy when the longer hand of the clock inched closer to the Lunch break, as India batters have been guilty of losing concentration close to the end of sessions. They wouldn't have wanted a repeat at Old Trafford, especially after the start, and both KL Rahul and Yashasvi Jaiswal ensured there were no casualties this time around. 78/0 was a job well done, and with both Rahul and Jaiswal getting their eye in, a post-Lunch feast was on the cards.Manchester has been very wet for the last one week, but it had very little bearing on the nature of the surface. Even after the rain and the moisture seeping in, the surface remained on the drier side, and it didn't have the spicy carry and the pace everyone expected it to offer. Chris Woakes asked a lot of questions early in the morning, but the rub of the green went to Jaiswal as he survived the edgy period and grew in confidence as the innings progressed.There was a nice buzz around the ground as the crowd got behind both teams, but India threw the start away as they lost wickets of KL Rahul, Yashasvi Jaiswal, and Shubman Gill in quick succession. It was Gill's wicket which gave Ben Stokes, and the entire England team, a spring in their stride, and they were very incisive during that passage of play.Sai Sudharsan had a trial by fire as Stokes stuck to his leg-side trap for the youngster, and it nearly paid off before Jamie Smith made a mess of a regulation catch behind the stumps. It could have been a horrible session for the visitors, but Sudharsan battled it out with Pant, and together they ensured India remained in control even when the few cracks on the pitch were doing the odd trick.Sudharsan was attacked on the stumps from around the wicket, had a trap for the flick/pull on the leg side, and he was presented the bait far too often, but he maintained the solidity and stuck to his character. For 150 deliveries, the left-hander gave a solid account of his batting temperament but perished pulling Stokes to Brydon Carse in the deep. All the hard work was undone by a shot that was not true to the character the left-hander is known for.India lost the set batter, and not far away from action, another left-hander was receiving first aid at the ground's medical centre. Accompanied by physio Yogesh Parmar and the medical team, Pant got attention before he was stretchered into an ambulance for further scans/treatment at a nearby medical facility. In the middle, Shardul Thakur and Ravindra Jadeja ensured there was no further damage as the team ended Day 1 at 264/4.","Rishabh Pant was taken off on a golf cart after sustaining a foot injury on Day 1 of the fourth Test between England and India in Manchester.

TimesofIndia.com in Manchester: On a day when India’s batters showed grit against England’s disciplined attack, Sai Sudharsan credited India's Test captain Shubman Gill for his calm guidance that helped him craft a vital 61 off 151 balls on Day 1 of the fourth Test at Old Trafford.“After first game, Shubi (Shubman Gill) gave me complete backing behind the scenes. He tells everybody clearly. It’s been same Shubi from IPL,” Sudharsan told reporters in the press conference after the day's play on Wednesday.Sudharsan, who replaced Karun Nair in the playing XI, looked composed even on a challenging surface that offered inconsistent bounce and seam movement.“There was variable bounce, two-paced wicket. Throughout the day, the ball was moving and was doing something off the pitch,” he explained.The young left-hander was candid about his dismissal, a mistimed pull to fine leg.“I didn’t know how I edged it down the leg. England do it quite often for other batters too. I was quite aware coming into this game,” he said.Despite the pressure of a comeback Test, Sudharsan insisted he was focused on playing for the team.“I am not looking at this as pressure but an opportunity to express myself.I wanted to play the situation and do well for the team,” he further said.Sudharsan also revealed that Rishabh Pant was struggling with pain after being struck on the right foot during his aggressive 37-run knock. “Rishabh Pant was in a lot of pain. He was batting really well today as well,” he remarked, hinting at a possible concern for the team management ahead of Day 2.India finished Day 1 at 264/4, with Ravindra Jadeja (19 not out) and Shardul Thakur (19 not out) holding fort.

Poll Do you believe Ayush Mhatre will be a future star for Indian cricket? Yes, definitely No, I don't think so

On a day when opener Vaibhav Suryavanshi was dismissed for a golden duck, India U19 captain Ayush Mhatre produced a magnificent counterattack, scoring a sensational century in the second Youth Test against England U19 at the County Ground in Chelmsford. Chasing a stiff target of 355 on Day 4, Mhatre led from the front, reaffirming his growing stature as one of India’s most promising young batters.The 18-year-old, who celebrated his birthday just a week earlier on July 16, has enjoyed a remarkable run of form in this series. Having marked his birthday with his teammates at Lord’s, Mhatre brought the celebrations to the pitch with a commanding performance.Opening the innings alongside Suryavanshi, Mhatre wasted no time in asserting himself, scoring freely and setting the tone for India’s chase. He formed a crucial partnership with wicketkeeper-batter Abhigyan Kundu, who also played a valuable role with a composed half-century. Mhatre raced to his century in just 64 balls, showcasing his fearless stroke play and positive intent. His eventual score of 126 came off just 80 deliveries, before he was caught attempting a slog sweep off the fourth ball of the 27th over from England’s Albert. His run tally featured 13 boundaries and 6 sixes.Mhatre’s consistency throughout the series has been a standout. In the first Youth Test at Beckenham, he scored a well-paced 102 off 115 balls in the first innings and followed it up with a brisk 32 in the second. He continued that momentum in the first innings of the Chelmsford Test with a fluent 80 from 90 deliveries.As India look to gain the upper hand in the series following a drawn first Test, Mhatre’s inspirational leadership and red-hot form have provided the perfect foundation in the high-pressure chase.","India U19 captain Ayush Mhatre scored a sensational century in the second Youth Test against England U19 at the County Ground in Chelmsford.

After falling out of favour at United, the 27-year-old spent the latter half of last season on loan at Aston Villa.At Barcelona, Rashford will be part of a forward line that already includes Lamine Yamal, Brazil’s Raphinha, and veteran striker Robert Lewandowski.Rashford arrived in Barcelona on Sunday to complete the deal. He met his new teammates and reportedly trained with the squad on Tuesday. Financial details of the agreement have not been disclosed, but Spanish media reports suggest the loan includes an option for Barcelona to buy the England international for around €30 million ($35 million).Barcelona had initially targeted Spain forward Nico Williams during the transfer window, but the Athletic Bilbao star signed a long-term extension, opening the door for Rashford’s move.Despite having the most prolific attack in Spain last season, Barcelona were keen to strengthen their frontline. The trio of Yamal, Raphinha, and Lewandowski combined to score 102 goals in the league — 24 more than Real Madrid's tally. They also led the Champions League scoring charts with 43 goals before being eliminated in the semifinals by Inter Milan.Rashford, a product of Manchester United’s academy, made 429 appearances and scored 138 goals, winning five major trophies with the club. However, he only reached the 20-goal mark in three seasons and scored a combined 15 goals in his last two at United. While at Villa, he added another four in 17 games.Despite his recent struggles, Rashford’s talent has rarely been doubted. He recently returned to the England squad under new coach Thomas Tuchel, keeping his hopes alive for a place at next year’s World Cup.","Marcus Rashford has joined Barcelona on a season-long loan from Manchester United.

Poll Do you agree with Crystal Palace's exclusion from the Europa League? Yes, they deserve to be excluded. No, they should be reinstated.

Crystal Palace supporters have staged a bold protest outside UEFA headquarters in Nyon, Switzerland, over the club’s controversial exclusion from the Europa League.Despite earning a spot in the competition by winning the FA Cup last season, Palace were ruled out by UEFA for allegedly breaching regulations related to multi-club ownership. The decision is being contested by the club at the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS), with a verdict expected on August 11.If the ruling stands, Nottingham Forest are expected to take Palace’s Europa League spot, with the Eagles moving down to the Europa Conference League.Refusing to stay silent, Palace fans, and the Holmesdale Fanatics in particular, carried out a symbolic protest by delivering a suitcase filled with fake money to UEFA’s lakeside offices. The gesture was meant to highlight what they see as UEFA’s preference for financial interests over fairness.Alongside the suitcase, a letter addressed to UEFA president Aleksander Ceferin was hand-delivered. It demanded the governing body reverse its decision and reinstate Palace in the Europa League.A post from the Holmesdale Fanatics on X reflected the supporters' sentiment and urgency in the appeal to reinstate the club.Part of it read, ""Following this, we then travelled to the CAS headquarters in Lausanne to remind their organisation that this ruling can and should be overturned. The protests against those responsible will continue. REINSTATE PALACE NOW.""The issue stems from American businessman John Textor holding ownership stakes in both Crystal Palace and French club Lyon, which is a situation that UEFA rules prohibit if both clubs qualify for the same competition.The fans' protest reflects growing frustration over what they see as an unfair punishment, and their message is clear: they believe Crystal Palace deserve their place in the Europa League.","Crystal Palace were excluded from the Europa League by UEFA.

Poll Do you believe Arsenal will maintain their dominance in women's football with this signing? Definitely Maybe, but it's not guaranteed No, other teams are catching up

Arsenal have completed a historic £1 million transfer of Canadian forward Olivia Smith from Liverpool, marking the first seven-figure transfer in women's football. The 20-year-old's move to the European champions surpasses the previous record of £900,000 paid by Chelsea for American defender Naomi Girma from San Diego Wave in January.The milestone transfer comes 44 years after Trevor Francis became the first male player to command a million-pound fee when he moved from Birmingham City to Nottingham Forest in 1979. Arsenal secured Smith's services after successful negotiations with Liverpool, who initially were reluctant to let go of their player of the season.""It's my dream to compete for the biggest titles here in England and in Europe and I'm excited to get started and contribute to doing that here with Arsenal,"" Smith said in a statement.Smith demonstrated her value at Liverpool last season, scoring nine goals and earning the club's player of the season award despite the team's struggles. Her versatility allows her to play both as a forward and on the wing, making her an attractive signing for Arsenal.Arsenal's director of women's football, Clare Wheatley, expressed enthusiasm about the signing: ""We're thrilled to bring Olivia to Arsenal. She's one of the most talented young players in the game and has huge potential for further development here.""Smith's journey in football began with her becoming the youngest player to represent Canada at age 15. She then moved to Sporting Lisbon in 2023, where she scored 16 goals in 28 games before joining Liverpool.""It's a privilege and an honor to sign for Arsenal. The atmosphere the supporters create at Emirates Stadium is incredible and I can't wait to have that behind me now,"" Smith stated.The transfer represents Arsenal's ambition to strengthen their position in women's football, following their Champions League victory. The club, which holds the distinction of being the most decorated in English women's football, has also secured the services of winger Chloe Kelly, Taylor Hinds, and Anneke Borbe on free transfers for the upcoming season.Liverpool, who finished seventh last season, plan to use the transfer fee to reinforce their squad. The record-breaking transfer signifies Arsenal's intent to maintain their dominance in the league while setting a new benchmark for women's football transfers.The transfer marks a significant moment in the development of women's football, establishing a new financial milestone that reflects the growing investment and commercial value in the women's game.

PANAJI: Three months after the All India Football Federation (AIFF) declared Churchill Brothers FC as the I-League winners and hastily handed over the trophy during a ceremony in Goa, the federation announced Inter Kashi FC as the new champions on Friday.The announcement follows orders from the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS), after the Switzerland-based tribunal set aside the AIFF appeals committee decision, which had adjudged that the re-registration of Mario Barco by the Varanasi-based club made him an ineligible player. Points were forfeited following a protest by three clubs – Churchill Brothers, Namdhari and Real Kashmir -- leaving them lower in the table.The CAS panel, an independent international body that settles disputes related to sport through arbitration, however set aside the appeals committee decision issued on May 31 and ordered AIFF to “adjust the points table of the I-League and declare Inter Kashi as champions.”The final points table leaves Kashi at the top with 42 points, two more than second-placed Churchill.Real Kashmir finished third with 37 points.“We won on the pitch, fair and square, but many could not accept that,” said club president Prithijit Das. “Our club is barely two years old, which played the I-League with heart and grit. Maybe because we weren’t part of the old order, false cases were filed, our integrity questioned, our name dragged. We didn’t give up. We went all the way to CAS, fought steadily, and won.”Significantly, this was the second win for Kashi at CAS in as many months after the Swiss body had previously overturned the appeals committee decision of taking away three points that were awarded by the disciplinary committee as Namdhari fielded an ineligible player (Cledson da Silva)“This win is not just ours. It’s a reminder of what sport should stand for; passion, fairness, and honesty, not politics,” said Das.AIFF was quick to readjust the league points table and officially declare Kashi as the new champions.“CAS has ruled that the AIFF shall declare Inter Kashi as winners of the I-League 2024-25. The AIFF congratulates Inter Kashi on being adjudged champions,” AIFF said in a statement.With the CAS order and AIFF’s statement, the I-League title race has now finally concluded, more than three months after the teams had played the last round of matches. On the final day, Churchill had their chances to settle the race on the ground itself but only ended up drawing 1-1 against Real Kashmir in Srinagar.Kashi, who were almost out of the race, turned the standings on its head after scoring twice in four stoppage-time minutes for a 3-1 win against Rajasthan United. The players celebrated at their home ground, believing they had come from behind not just for a win but also a memorable triumph.“It was a very difficult time for everyone at the club but in the end, victory is ours. We have won not just the I-League title, but our name and respect as well,” said Das.","Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) overturns AIFF decision to declare Churchill Brothers the I-League champions.

From a mental health perspective, I feel a lot lighter, like a weight has come off my shoulders. It’s not something we drivers talk about very often, but the last few days have been a huge release of emotion and energy. It feels great.

Other Formula E initiatives

Formula E has several initiatives running under its sustainability campaign. Among them is a youth education program called Driving Force, supported by PIF E360. It aims to teach children between the ages of 8 and 18 about science, technology, and sustainability. The goal is to reach over 50,000 students worldwide by the end of 2025.The Driving Force initiative comes at a time when there is expected to be a massive demand for 200,000 skilled workers in the UK for green jobs by 2030, according to PwC.Driving Force helps students learn about clean energy and the environment. It also introduces them to role models from the fields of science and technology, helping them gain the knowledge and confidence needed to consider careers in these areas. These workshops use fun and practical activities to show how what students learn in school can lead to exciting real-world careers in racing, clean energy, engineering, and more.On July 16, over 90 students participated in Formula E’s Driving Force workshop at Hammersmith Academy in London. The session was one of five workshops held at schools across London in July, near the London E-Prix race site in East London and Formula E’s headquarters in Hammersmith.Earlier this year, similar workshops were also held in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, and Miami, USA, during Formula E race weeks.Julia Pallé, VP of Sustainability at Formula E, said, ""A survey in 2024 of more than 7,000 UK secondary school students reveals a worrying downward trend in both their involvement in and their ambition to pursue STEM subjects — a stark wake-up call for educators and policymakers alike.""""Teachers are being asked to make stronger connections between subjects and careers, but they need support from employers to do that effectively. Driving Force, presented by PIF E360, is part of the solution to help the education system deliver what our students and our green economy both desperately need to succeed,” she added.Also Read: Taylor Barnard overtakes Antonio Felix Da Costa in Berlin to claim 3rd in Formula E Driver Standings Formula E’s broader social impact strategy includes several other initiatives such as FIA Girls on Track, the Better Futures Fund, and Inspiration Hour.

It’s not unusual for teams to introduce new designs for special Formula E races, be it for livery or driver suits. While Nissan’s cherry blossom livery at the Tokyo E-Prix was a hit and now NEOM McLaren will be racing in a striking white and blue livery, the Lola Yamaha ABT team did something absolutely unexpected at the Berlin E-Prix.

Seems like I'm in the wrong place at the wrong time too often. 3 wins lost in the last laps because of safety cars, a few mistakes my mixture, the season could have been so different, but that's what it is in sport, and the bad moments, if used well, are the best thing we have.

Oliver Rowland’s journey in Formula E was full of ups and downs

Oliver Rowland shares his happiness on Formula E championship win

Things weren’t always well-planned for Oliver Rowland, who has just clinched the Formula E World Championship. The 32-year-old Nissan driver took major risks throughout his career, including walking away from a team without another offer in hand. He describes that time as one of the toughest periods of his life. But Rowland eventually bounced back, joining a new team and going on to win the championship this season.Oliver Rowland made his one-race debut in Formula E with Mahindra Racing at the 2015 Punta del Este ePrix, replacing the injured Nick Heidfeld. He quickly disappeared from the scene afterward.Reflecting on that strange start in Formula E’s second season, Rowland told Formula E’s official website, “If you go back to Punta del Este, I remember having no idea about anything when I arrived and leaving thinking, ‘I'm not sure I want to do that again, because it was pretty tough.’”He eventually returned as a full-time Formula E driver with Nissan e.dams in 2018. After delivering notable performances over a few seasons, he switched to Mahindra Racing in 2021. However, midway through the 2023 season, Rowland made another bold move — quitting the team without a confirmed offer elsewhere. Nissan brought him back the following season, leading to two remarkable years that culminated in him winning the Season 11 championship.Speaking about his decision to leave Mahindra Racing in 2023 after two seasons, Rowland said, “I took a huge risk for my career and for my family because my contract is what keeps us all fed and watered, so walking away from that was a really, really tough period in my life. I remember not sleeping for like, two, three weeks at some point. To kind of write the story and come out on the other side with the team that I started in Formula E with is just perfect. ”He added, “As a racing driver, a lot of days are bad, and you have to keep believing in yourself — that you're capable of doing it. Going into this year, I was confident that we would have a good chance.”Now, Oliver Rowland has become the Formula E World Champion in just his second year back with Nissan. “The moment I arrived in the championship and looked at the caliber of drivers here and the previous World Champions, it's such a good achievement for me to become World Champion. To be part of that is incredible,” he said.Also Read: Oliver Rowland’s rise to champion: Rare childhood moments highlighted in touching video Rowland will now race in front of his home crowd in London, where he’ll lift the World Championship trophy.

How Taylor Barnard surpassed Antonio Felix Da Costa in Driver Standings

This is 21-year-old Taylor Barnard’s first full-fledged season as a rookie driver, and the NEOM McLaren racer has achieved what many of his peers couldn’t. At the recently held Berlin E-Prix, Barnard put up a strong performance on the track, managing to surpass Antonio Felix Da Costa and take the third spot in the standings. With two races remaining, Barnard still has a chance to overtake Pascal Wehrlein for the second place.Taylor Barnard outperformed TAG Heuer Porsche’s Antonio Felix Da Costa in Berlin. Da Costa, who had been comfortably sitting in third, has now slipped to fourth in the standings.Taking to Instagram to reflect on his Berlin performance, Barnard wrote, “Reflecting on Berlin. Definitely a weekend of what could have been, but we scored good points across both races, closing the gap to P2 in the standings. An unfortunately timed SC on Sunday cost us the chance of going for the win, but we will maximise our efforts to go into London as strong as possible.Taylor Barnard finished fourth in Round 13 and sixth in Round 14 race at the Berlin E-Prix, collecting a total of 20 points. In comparison, Da Costa finished 10th and 8th in the two races, scoring just 5 points — enabling Barnard to leap ahead of him in the standings.Currently, Oliver Rowland has sealed the Formula E Championship title with 184 points.Pascal Wehrlein holds second place with 125 points, while Barnard trails closely behind with 112. A strong performance in London could be enough for Barnard to overtake Wehrlein and claim second place in the championship.So far this season, Barnard has secured five podium finishes — one each in Sao Paulo, Tokyo, and Shanghai, and two in Jeddah — though he is yet to clinch his first Formula E race win.Barnard will now race on home soil in London alongside his McLaren teammate Sam Bird. The duo will sport a new blue-and-white livery and race suits.

How fate turned around for 3 Formula E drivers at Berlin E-Prix on Sunday

Jean-Eric Vergne on winning his second podium of the season

DS Penske driver Jean-Eric Vergne finally clinched his second podium of the season at the Berlin E-Prix. The Number 25 driver had hoped to secure a podium position in Saturday’s Round 13 race as well, but he was unable to finish the race. He is, however, happy with how things turned out on Sunday and has shared his joy at the podium finish.Interestingly, all three drivers — Jean-Eric Vergne, Jake Dennis, and Oliver Rowland, who failed to finish Round 13 in Berlin on Saturday had a reason to celebrate on Sunday. While Vergne grabbed third place on the podium and Dennis finished second, Rowland missed the podium but sealed his Formula E World Championship victory.Jean-Eric Vergne started from 18th on the grid and put on a great performance to finish third in the Round 14 race. Sharing his experience at the Tempelhof Airport Circuit during the Berlin E-Prix weekend, Vergne said, “I guess I took it a little bit easy at the beginning, it feels nice to be on the podium, especially after the bad luck yesterday. I think another podium yesterday would have been possible, so overall I’m quite happy with the weekend.It was a strong one, and the team deserves a little bit of a reward. I’m happy for the guys, it was a good race!”Taking to Instagram, the French driver shared a picture of himself sipping champagne on the podium and captioned it, “Was good to drink champagne in Berlin.”His fans and friends erupted in celebration in the comments section and congratulated him on his podium spot. One fan wrote, “So well deserved, my eagle. Congrats to you and the team!” Another said, “Congratulations on the podium, Jean-Eric. Look forward to seeing you in London.” One more commented, “Fantastic race!!! Congratulations.”Jean-Eric Vergne had earlier secured a podium finish in Shanghai, where he finished second in Round 10 of the Formula E season.

Oliver Rowland was worried after how Round 13 turned out in Berlin

Formula E Berlin Round 14 – 60‑Second Blitz!

Pascal Wehrlein’s Round 14 performance sealed Oliver Rowland’s championship win

Oliver Rowland’s fans kept their fingers crossed and waited with bated breath for the Nissan driver to seal his Formula E World Championship at the Round 13 race in Berlin on Saturday. But the day ended on a sad note for the driver as he failed to even finish the race, while his closest competitor, Pascal Wehrlein, clinched second spot on the podium, closing the gap between them in the Formula E Driver Standings. Rowland has confirmed that he did doubt his championship win when things didn’t play out well that day.There was reason to be worried for Nissan driver Oliver Rowland when TAG Heuer Porsche’s Pascal Wehrlein closed the gap between them in the Driver Standings to 50 points. He was second in the Formula E Driver Standings and could have changed the championship outcome with two more races remaining in the season.Sharing his fears in an interview with Formula E, he said, “I was hoping before the weekend that the outcome could be [the World Championship], but after yesterday (Saturday) and this morning (Sunday) I was more worried that it might never come.”Pascal Wehrlein ended 15th in the Round 14 race on Sunday despite starting from pole position.Rowland eventually bounced back to finally seal his championship win by finishing fourth in the race. He missed out on the podium, which had Jaguar TCS Racing’s Nick Cassidy as the winner, but his 12 points, along with his closest competitor Pascal Wehrlein’s disappointing performance, were enough for him to clinch the championship.“I wasn't aware of where Pascal was at all. My engineer came on, I think with four or five laps to go, and said ‘P4 is good,’ and I thought that's a bit weird. Then I looked at the TV screen, and I got to about eighth, and I thought, ‘Oh, he's not in the top eight then.’ The next time I came around looking again, I found him when I started from the bottom. I didn't know if he'd had a problem, so then I was aware that fourth would be enough if Wehrlein didn't score, so I knew that myself. I didn't want to ask, because I didn't want to jinx anything,” he said.Oliver Rowland took to Instagram on Wednesday to share a post to mark his Formula E Championship win. Sharing a few pictures of his celebrations with his team, the Nissan driver wrote: “2025 FIA FORMULA E WORLD CHAMPION! It still hasn’t quite sunk in what we have achieved this season. I couldn’t have imagined being in this position 2 years ago! Thank you to my incredible team @nismo & everyone that’s supported me! Thank you for all the messages and well wishes I’ve received in the last 48 hours!

Poll What do you think is the biggest factor in Alcaraz's decision to withdraw? Wimbledon fatigue and recovery Injury concerns

World No. 2 Carlos Alcaraz has pulled out of next week’s ATP Canadian Open in Toronto, citing the need to recover after his run to the Wimbledon final earlier this month. Tournament organisers confirmed the Spaniard’s withdrawal on Monday.Alcaraz, a five-time Grand Slam singles champion, lost to world No. 1 Jannik Sinner in the Wimbledon final on July 13. The 22-year-old had been aiming for a third consecutive Wimbledon title.""I'm really sad to have to miss the National Bank Open in Toronto,"" Alcaraz said in a statement.

This comes right after other big names dropped out of the ATP Masters hardcourt tournament.“After many consecutive weeks of competition without rest, I will not be able to play in Toronto this year,” Alcaraz wrote on X. “I have small muscle issues and I need to recover physically and mentally for what comes next. To the tournament and to my fans in Canada I am very sorry, I will see you next year!”Sinner, who beat Alcaraz at Wimbledon, won't defend his Toronto title due to an elbow injury from a fall at the All England Club.

If

How do you, when beaten to the ground, bruised and busted, get back on your feet? Jannik Sinner knows.The 23-year-old wore his pain plainly in Paris, seated at his court side space, having finished at the wrong end of the five-hour 29-minute epic against Carlos Alcaraz.Five weeks later, on a dazzling Sunday in July, he punctuated a five-match losing streak against his arch nemesis, and brought a rivalry to life on Wimbledon ’s lawns. No tennis player has crossed the channel with greater purpose than Sinner, turning the Paris heartbreak to a memorable hurrah, his fourth Major title, and first in this leafy London suburb.The mental miles the 23-year-old Italian covered in the five weeks must anoint him as the sport’s newest mentalist.On the wall of the players’ entrance to Centre Court are the words from, a Rudyard Kipling poem: “If you can meet with triumph and disaster/ And treat those two impostors just the same.”In terms of expression, Sinner doesn’t give much away, no passionate celebration like Alcaraz on Paris’ red clay, just a smile that sparked his eyes. The turnaround was scripted during a stretch that features a diabolic switch of surfaces, from stubborn red clay to slick grass.It was when the Italian picked himself up, and in washing away the stains of squandering three successive match points, he underlined the size of his fight.There were big questions surrounding Sinner’s morale coming into Wimbledon. “This is the part I’m the proudest of because it has not been easy,” said Sinner, who tried to take positives from his loss in Paris. “It’s much better that you lose a Grand Slam final that way than someone kills you, you make two games.”The Italian’s coaches — Darren Cahill and Simone Vagnozzi — discussed Roland Garros threadbare with Sinner for about 24 hours after the final but didn’t bring it up again thereafter.“For us it was important to move forward as quickly as possible,” Cahill said. “The week leading to Wimbledon was the best practice week we’ve ever had as far as attitude and form. We knew we had something special coming in. We knew that he had already put Roland Garros behind him. He was playing with real purpose. You could see that from the first match that he played, he wasn’t carrying any baggage from Roland Garros.”Following his win on Sunday, the world No. 1 leaves London with a hefty 3,430-point lead over Alcaraz.Sinner’s struggles of the last six months — when he served a three-month doping ban (February to May) for testing positive for anabolic agent clostebol — included the reactions of the locker room, most of who weren’t supportive of the Italian. A large section of the players thought the four-time Major winner had been treated favourably, add to that the vitriol directed at him on social media, and he was wading through murky waters.The 23-year-old, a methodical creature, turned to work, shrugging the weight off his shoulders. “We’ve tried to push at every practice session, I was struggling at times mentally,” Sinner explained. “Maybe even more in practice sessions because I feel when I play the match, I can switch off and just play.”Sinner’s win on Sunday was significant as much for himself as for this young rivalry. While the Italian is obviously too good a player to never beat the Spaniard again, the five successive losses across a near two-year stretch was beginning to gnaw. Sinner said, “When you lose several times against someone, it’s not easy.”Cahill pinned Sinner’s victory to the details. “You saw a bit more energy from him in the big moments, a bit more focus to knuckle down and make sure that when he had his nose in front, he kept on closing the door against Carlos,” the Aussie said.Vagnozzi added, “He was brave today, in the important moments he was really brave.”Alcaraz, the charismatic Spaniard, now leads the rivalry 8-5, but these numbers become irrelevant on the court where the margins are infinitesimal. Also, Sinner and Alcaraz are a level above the rest of the field.“Our level is really high, we don’t watch a level like this when other players are playing against each other,” Alcaraz said. “This rivalry is becoming better and better. We’re building a really great rivalry, we’re playing in the finals of Grand Slams, Masters, the best tournaments in the world. It’s going to get better and better.”That’s the bargain the Italian spent a little over three hours on Sunday signing on.",Jannik Sinner beat Carlos Alcaraz to win Wimbledon men's singles title.

Poll Will Sinner's Wimbledon victory change the future of Italian tennis? Yes, it will inspire future generations No, it won't have a significant impact

Jannik Sinner whipped a forehand cross-court that had Carlos Alcaraz scrambling to his right. The energetic Spaniard was on it in a flash. Two shots later, it was Alcaraz's turn to have Sinner on the run - moving to his right on a short, angled ball. The Italian responded with a cracking forehand down the line that looked destined to be a winner. In most cases, against most opponents, that would have been a winner or at least forced an error. Instead, Alcaraz took a couple of steps to his left, flung his backhand with some spin, and it landed in - much to everyone's surprise. The crowd on Centre Court was up on its feet.Still, 44 minutes into the Wimbledon final, Jannik Sinner could be forgiven for thinking about yet another title clash he had let slip. Just four weeks ago, Sinner was two sets up against Alcaraz in the French Open final. The Italian had three championship points, and failed to capitalise. Alcaraz went on to turn the match around to clinch his fifth major title.The script was turning out to be quite similar so far. Sinner led 4-2 in the first set and hadn’t put a foot wrong. Yet, Alcaraz elevated his level to bag four games in a row, including that seemingly unwinnable point, to take the opener.The turning point came a game later. It wasn’t a stellar shot, or a crucial juncture in the contest, or one of the many dramatic points played between these two new rivals in men’s tennis. It was a routine forehand that Alcaraz sent long at 30-40 in the second set. It gave Sinner the service break and the momentum, which he never let go of.Forty-eight minutes after seeing that ball land in, dropping the first set and possibly getting those flashes of Paris, it was Sinner’s turn to hit a remarkable shot to clinch the second set. The 22-year-old Spaniard’s angled backhand pushed Sinner to his left. The 23-year-old went down the line before Alcaraz forced him into covering the vacant court. On the run – seemingly with sliding shoes on – Sinner threw the kitchen sink at it, firing a forehand cross-court winner. “Unbelievable,” chimed the commentator. The crowd, on its feet, felt similarly, with the decibel level rising.The dramatics of that Paris evening on June 8 were not repeated – even if there were hints of it. In the fourth set, having taken the third, Sinner broke early like he had in Paris. But he never gave it back – unlike Paris. There was a whiff of danger as two break-point chances came and went for Alcaraz at 4-3.There were no signs of nerves, either, as Sinner closed out the match to win his first Wimbledon title with a 137mph serve his fastest of the day.“He needed that win today,” Sinner’s coach Darren Cahill said. “So he knew the importance of closing this one out when he had the opportunities. I think you saw a bit more energy from him in the big moments and a bit more focus to knuckle down and make sure that when he had his nose in front, that he kept on closing the door against Carlos.”The emotions at the end showed how much it meant to him. He raised both arms before going down on his haunches in the middle of the court and tapping the grass, as the applause grew bigger and louder. The top-ranked player then made his way to his coaches, his family, and friends including his brother, who didn’t miss it this time for a Formula 1 race!Sinner’s ability to out-hit opponents cannot be doubted. As he became the first Italian to win a singles title at Wimbledon, his mental fortitude stood out as well.“It’s the part I’m most proud of because it hasn’t been easy. I always try to be honest with myself. Things can happen. If you lose a Grand Slam final that way, it’s much better than losing where someone kills you by losing two games,” he said of bouncing back from the disappointment of losing the French Open final. “That’s why I said after Roland Garros that it’s not the time to put me down because another Grand Slam is coming up – and I did great here,” he added.Sinner had the champagne cork between his fingers during the second set as an overzealous fan popped some bubbly at SW19. At the time, all the Italian did was usher it to the ball girl, who got rid of it. “Only here at Wimbledon – but that’s exactly why we love playing here,” he said after the match when asked if he’d ever had that happen before. “It’s a very expensive tournament, you know,” he added to laughs.At the time, getting his hands on some champagne was premature. Now, with the job done, and deservedly so, he got his hands on the champagne, the trophy, and £3,000,000 in prize money.",Jannik Sinner beat Carlos Alcaraz in straight sets to win Wimbledon men's singles title.

Indian-American Ronit Karki may not have cleared the final hurdle in the Wimbledon junior boys event on Sunday, but the 17-year-old has done enough these last two weeks working his way through the qualifying draw and making the title round -to show that he’s a talent to watch out for.Karki went down 2-6, 3-6 to world No.6 Ivan Ivanov, the 16year-old from of Bulgaria, in the boy’s final. Earlier in his run to the final, Karki, ranked 52, took down No.9 Yannik Alexandrescou of Romania, No. 8 Jack Kennedy of the United States, No.14 Alan Wazny of Poland, and No. 12 Alexander Vasilev of Bulgaria. Karki played the J300 at Roehampton two weeks ago, making the third round, when competing for the first time on grass.The New Jersey-born teen, who trains in Florida, was just one out of the main draw, but said he wouldn’t change a thing about playing the qualifiers. “Everything is connected, so maybe playing the qualifying draw was a good thing, and maybe the reason why I’m here right now,” he said.Karki, whose family home is in East Brunswick, New Jersey, took to tennis because his father Trilok started playing the sport when he lived in New York with his wife Kanchan. “My sister (Naomi) started playing tennis too, then I just picked it up because my sister and my dad played it,” Karki said, “My dad is the reason I play tennis.”","Ronit Karki, 17, lost 2-6, 3-6 to world No.6 Ivan Ivanov in the Wimbledon junior boys final.

NEW DELHI: Indian men's cricket team head coach Gautam Gambhir on Saturday used the post-match press conference after the third ODI win against South Africa to respond to the criticism that followed India’s 2-0 Test series defeat.Gambhir said the reaction to the Test losses ignored key details. He said: ""There were so many things said and written after we lost the Test series against South Africa, but nobody spoke about the fact that in the first Test we played without our captain, who didn't bat in either innings (Shubman Gill, who was out after playng three balls in the first innings due to neck injury) and we lost the match by just 30 runs. If you are going through a transition and lose your captain, who is also an in-form batter, it's tough. No one talked about this.""Gambhir also responded to comments made by Delhi Capitals co-owner Parth Jindal, who had called for split coaching in Indian cricket after the Test series defeat. Gambhir said: ""A lot was said. Even people who have nothing to do with cricket spoke up. An IPL owner also wrote about split captaincy."" He added: ""Everyone should remain in their domain. If we don't interfere in other's domain, then they don't have the right to interfere in our domain"".Jindal had criticised India’s Test performance after the 2-0 loss against South Africa . He posted on X: ""Not even close, what a complete thrashing at home! Don’t remember seeing our test side being so weak at home!!! This is what happens when red ball specialists are not picked."" He also wrote: ""This team is nowhere near reflective of the deep strength we possess in the red ball format.

NEW DELHI: After India’s nine-wicket win over South Africa in Visakhapatnam sealed the ODI series 2-1, a light-hearted moment between Virat Kohli and Arshdeep Singh that quickly went viral.As players celebrated the comprehensive victory, Arshdeep jokingly told Kohli, “Few runs short, otherwise another century was confirmed for you.”Kohli instantly fired back, laughing, “It was good we won the toss, otherwise you would have also completed your century due to the dew!”The exchange reflected the relaxed aura around the Indian camp, especially with Kohli back at his dominant best.Kohli finished the series as the leading run-scorer with 302 runs, following hundreds in the first two games and an unbeaten 65 in the finale.More importantly for him, the innings symbolised a mental shift.“Honestly, playing the way I have in the series is the most satisfying thing for me. I feel really free in my mind. I haven't played like this in 2-3 years,” Kohli said after receiving the Player of the Series award.The former captain admitted that even seasoned players aren’t immune to self-doubt.“When you play for that long — 15-16 years — you do doubt yourself. Especially as a batter when one mistake can get you out. It's a whole journey of getting better and getting better as a person along the way.It improves you as a person and it improves temperament as well.”India’s win was shaped by their bowlers, with Prasidh Krishna (4/66) and Kuldeep Yadav (4/41) dismantling South Africa’s middle order after a strong start led by ton-up Quinton de Kock.With the ODI series wrapped up and spirits high, banter included, both teams now shift focus to the upcoming T20Is in Cuttack.",India beat South Africa by nine wickets in Visakhapatnam to win ODI series 2-1.

Gautam Gambhir Press Conference: Team India head coach heaves fire after 2-1 ODI series win over SA

VIZAG: KL Rahul was beaming after India won the toss for the first time in 21 matches. That change of luck proved a good omen as India rode on Yashasvi Jaiswal’s masterful maiden ODI century (116*; 121b, 12x4, 2x6) and another ‘Ro-Ko’ special to record a commanding nine-wicket victory over South Africa, sealing the series 2-1 in the bargain here at the ACA-VDCA stadium.India’s batters complemented the excellent show of their bowlers earlier in the afternoon. Prasidh Krishna (4/66) and Kuldeep Yadav (4/41) helped India skittle out the opposition for 270 in 47.5 overs. The full house that turned up in anticipation of a ‘Ro-Ko’ show got their money’s worth as Rohit Sharma (75; 73b, 7x4, 3x6) and Virat Kohli (65*; 45b, 6x4, 3x6) entertained the crowd with their trademark shots to ensure the hosts romped home in 39.5 overs.With dew being a major factor, Rahul gladly invited the opposition to bat and his bowlers did a fine job, despite Quinton de Kock smashing his 23rd ODI century (106; 89b, 8x4, 6x6), his seventh against India.Jaiswal and Rohit began the chase brilliantly with a big opening stand. Jaiswal hit Lungi Ngidi for a six straight over his head while Rohit walked down to the same bowler to despatch him for a maximum over deep midwicket.He then swept Keshav Maharaj for a boundary as India posted 48 for no loss in 10 overs. Rohit reached his half-century off 54 balls and took India to 102/0 in the 20th over. Rohit smoked Bosch for a six over deep square leg and at the other end, Jaiswal reached his half-century off 75 balls off Bosch and celebrated it with consecutive boundaries in the same over.Rohit, however, holed out to mid wicket off Keshav Maharaj in the 26th over. Kohli then entertained the crowd and the stadium erupted when he hit Bosch for a ‘no-look’ six in the 34th over. Jaiswal nudged Bosch for a single to reach his maiden century in 111 balls. At the other end, Kohli hit Bosch for a four to reach his fifty off 40 balls and sealed the match with consecutive boundaries off Ngidi.Earlier, Arshdeep Singh provided India the perfect start by dismissing Ryan Rickleton with the fifth ball of the innings. Harshit Rana and Arsh deep bowled tight lines and de Kock and Temba Bavuma chose to be cautious, taking their side to 42/1 in 10 overs. De Kock then launched into Prasidh, smashing him for 18 runs with back-to-back sixes and a boundary in the 11th over.De Kock and Bavuma added 113 runs and looked threatening before Jadeja broke the stand. He forced a false stroke off Bavuma (48; 67b, 5x4), who was caught at point by Kohli. But de Kock, who had poor outings in Ranchi and Raipur, looked in fine nick here, sweeping and pulling the bowlers with authority. He added 54 runs with Matthew Breetzke (24; 23b, 2x6).Prasidh, who also had a poor series so far, made amends with twin blows in the 29th over to check the Proteas’ progress. He first trapped Breetzke leg before and removed last match centurion Aiden Markram (1), who drove the bowler straight into the hands of Kohli at covers and reduced the visitors to 170/4.""Honestly, playing the way I have in the series is the most satisfying thing for me. I feel really free in my mind. I haven’t played like this in 2-3 years. I know when I can bat like that in the middle, it helps the team a long way."" — Virat Kohli | Player of the SeriesDe Kock hit Harshit for a six to reach his ton in 80 balls. But he soon perished when Prasidh rattled his stumps in the 33rd over. Kuldeep then put paid to SA’s hopes of posting a big total with the wickets of Dewald Bre vis (29) and Marco Jansen (17) in a span of three balls. Brevis was beaten by flight and was caught at mid-wicket while Jansen holed out to deep midwicket.

NEW DELHI: Defending champions Argentina and strong contenders Spain received favourable draws for the 2026 World Cup during a star-studded ceremony.Lionel Messi’s Argentina will kick off their title defense — following their triumph in Qatar 2022 — against Algeria, before facing Austria and debutants Jordan in Group J.Spain, European champions and among the tournament favorites, will begin their campaign against first-time qualifiers Cape Verde, with Uruguay and Saudi Arabia completing Group H.Two-time winners France face challenging tests in Group I against Senegal and Erling Haaland’s Norway, with the group rounded out by an intercontinental play-off winner from Iraq, Bolivia, or Suriname.For the first time, the draw was structured to keep the four highest-ranked teams apart — meaning Spain, Argentina, France, and England cannot meet before the semi-finals, should they all top their respective groups.Key reactions from coaches after the 2026 World Cup draw in Washington on Friday:Roberto Martinez, coach of Portugal. Drawn with Uzbekistan, a qualifier and Colombia in Group K:""I think contenders is the right word. But I think the favorites are the teams that have won the World Cup before because there is a psychological aspect... I think we have to grow still, but we are full of hope and excitement.""The 1966 team of Eusebio is the reference point for us... We have won the European Championship and the Nations League and now I think it is very important that we should be able to fight for the dream we all have, to do something we have never done before.""On Cristiano Ronaldo's longevity: ""I think the secret he has is that he works every day as if it were the last day of his career... He never loses his hunger, he is an example for all of us. He is our captain, a reference for us, and very important for us.""Walid Regragui, coach of Morocco. Drawn with Brazil, Scotland and Haiti in Group C.""We're playing against one of the favorites (Brazil) right from the start, and they are playing one of the favorites right from the start,"" a confident Regragui said of Morocco's opening match against the five-time World Cup winners.""Whatever happens, Brazil remain Brazil. They are always potential winners. Having one of the potential winners in our group, and to play them in the first game, is never easy. They have picked up one of best coaches in the world (Carlo Ancelotti) with lots of experience -- he will give them serenity. We will try to be up to the task to make our fans proud.""Steve Clarke, coach of Scotland. Drawn with Brazil, Morocco and Haiti in Group C:""Brazil are an institution, if you like, they are one of the top teams. You always want to play against Brazil, so we have the chance to do that and I am pretty sure we will give them a good game.""It will be a tough game as always -- it will be (the) third game in the group. Hopefully we (will) have some points in the bag before we play them, but to get to a World Cup for a country like Scotland, it has taken us a long time to get back here -- 1998 was the last time, so we were determined to get there and do well... Every game in the World Cup is special –- we don't get there very often so every game is special for us.""Bubista, coach of first-time qualifiers Cape Verde. Drawn with Spain, Saudi Arabia and Uruguay in Group H:""We want to show people who we are (and) play with heart, a good attitude and a lot of humility. It is not a matter of being afraid of Spain. I am pleased to be playing against Spain because I played in Spain for (club side) Badajoz. It is just about enjoying the game, against a team we obviously need to be very wary of.""It means a lot for us, for our country –- everyone will be watching. Our country will be better known around the world... We won our qualifying group and we are very proud to be in our first World Cup.""Dick Advocaat, coach of Curacao, also making their World Cup debut. Drawn with Germany,Ivory Coast and Ecuador in Group E:""Three difficult teams for us but in principle every game is difficult. It is exciting to play there at the highest level and we will see what we can do.""One thing is that we have a team with a lot of fighters and I know from experience we are always difficult to beat, so every opponent we come up against will have to play very well. It is exciting for the island, the people are so proud.""","Defending champions Argentina and strong contenders Spain received favourable draws for the 2026 World Cup.

NEW DELHI: Defending champions Argentina and European powerhouse Spain received favourable group draws for the 2026 World Cup during a star-studded ceremony that also saw U.S. President Donald Trump awarded FIFA’s new peace prize.The draw, held at the Kennedy Center in Washington, marked the official countdown to the expanded 48-team tournament, now just six months away.Lionel Messi and Argentina will open their title defense against Algeria, with further group-stage fixtures against Austria and tournament debutants Jordan in Group J.Spain, among the leading contenders and current European champions, will begin their campaign against first-time qualifiers Cape Verde before facing Uruguay and Saudi Arabia in Group H.""All the praise will not weaken us, quite the opposite,"" insisted Spain coach Luis de la Fuente.""We want to do something big at this World Cup and that means making sure we do well in the group stage, then carrying on from there.""Thomas Tuchel's England, seeking to win the World Cup for the first time since 1966, will hope to win Group L that features beaten 2018 finalists Croatia as well as Ghana and Panama.Two-time winners France, meanwhile, face awkward tests against Senegal and Erling Haaland's Norway in Group I, which will be completed by an intercontinental play-off winner from either Iraq, Bolivia or Suriname.For the first time, the draw was done in such a way as to ensure the four highest-ranked nations were kept apart -- Spain, Argentina, France and England cannot meet before the semi-finals, if all four top their groups.However, the path to that stage -- with an extra knockout round now following the group phase -- looks perilous for some of the contenders.If the top seeds all finish first in their groups, England could, for example, find themselves playing co-hosts Mexico in Mexico City in the last 16 and then Brazil in the quarter-finals, before a last-four clash with Argentina.The tournament will be held across the United States, Mexico and Canada from June 11 to July 19, with 16 more teams added to the global showpiece, up from the 32 nations involved in 2022.That means a total of 104 matches, compared to 64 games last time.While the US will host the majority of matches including the final at the MetLife Stadium outside New York, three of the 16 venues will be in Mexico and two in Canada.The three hosts have experienced turbulent relations since Trump came to power but he brushed that aside.""We've worked closely with those two countries, and the coordination and friendship and relationship has been outstanding,"" Trump said after receiving his peace prize from FIFA president Gianni Infantino.""It is truly one of the great honors of my life. It is such an honor to be with Gianni. He has done such an incredible job,"" Trump added.Trump seized the limelight, even dancing when the Village People performed, but Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney and Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum were also in attendance.The event was co-hosted by supermodel Heidi Klum and American actor and comedian Kevin Hart. NFL legend Tom Brady, ice hockey icon Wayne Gretzky and former NBA superstar Shaquille O'Neal were among the stars who helped conduct the draw.Co-hosts Mexico will take on South Africa in Group A in the opening game of the tournament at the Estadio Azteca in Mexico City on June 11.Carlo Ancelotti's Brazil and surprise 2022 semi-finalists Morocco came out together in Group C, which also features Scotland and Haiti.Germany's opponents in Group E will be Ivory Coast, Ecuador and Caribbean minnows Curacao, while Cristiano Ronaldo's Portugal will face Uzbekistan, Colombia and a play-off winner.Co-hosts the United States got a manageable draw, with Paraguay, Australia and a European play-off winner in Group D.The top two teams in each group advance to the last 32, joined by the eight best third-placed teams.""It will be the greatest World Cup ever,"" Infantino claimed. ""This is like 104 Super Bowls in one month -- this is the magnitude of what we are organizing.""Because of the complexity, teams will only learn the full details of their match venues and kick-off times on Saturday.The 12 groups for the 2026 World Cup in the United States, Canada and Mexico from June 11 to July 19, 2026 following Friday's draw in Washington:Mexico, South Africa, South Korea, a qualifierCanada, a qualifier, Qatar, SwitzerlandBrazil, Morocco, Haiti, ScotlandUnited States, Paraguay, Australia, a qualifierGermany, Curacao, Ivory Coast, EcuadorNetherlands, Japan, a qualifier, TunisiaBelgium, Egypt, Iran, New ZealandSpain, Cape Verde, Saudi Arabia, UruguayFrance, Senegal, qualifier, NorwayArgentina, Algeria, Austria, JordanPortugal, a qualifier, Uzbekistan, ColombiaEngland, Croatia, Ghana, Panama","Defending champions Argentina and Spain receive favourable group draws for the 2026 World Cup.

NEW DELHI: Twelve Indian Super League (ISL) clubs have approached the All India Football Federation (AIFF) with urgent concerns about the domestic football crisis. The situation has become critical as the Marketing Rights Agreement between AIFF and Football Sports Development Limited expires on December 8.The affected clubs include FC Goa, Sporting Club Delhi, NorthEast United FC, Jamshedpur FC, Bengaluru FC, Mohun Bagan Super Giant, Chennauyin FC, Mumbai City FC, Kerala Blasters, Punjab FC, Odisha FC, and Mohammedan Sporting.Inter Kashi, a newly promoted team, have also joined the initiative.""While majority of the clubs have continued to honour salaries and contractual dues to players and staff in good faith, the current position is not merely challenging it is approaching commercial impossibility and risks rendering ongoing operations untenable,"" the clubs stated in their letter to AIFF president Kalyan Chaubey.""For nearly eleven years, ISL clubs have continued to invest substantially in football in India despite persistent losses on strength of a predictable league structure and, most critically, central revenue. This revenue stream has historically been the principal source of income that enabled clubs to manage salaries, infrastructure, and sporting operations.""With the expiry of the MRA and the consequent absence of a commercial rights holder, central revenue has ceased entirely.The uncertainty has also caused local sponsors to withdraw or pause commercial commitments, leaving clubs with no viable income whatsoever, despite ongoing obligations.""The clubs have recommended that AIFF collaborate with the government to address these issues. They suggest submitting proposed actions to sports minister Mansukh Mandaviya before December 8 to inform the Supreme Court about remedial measures.""... time is now of the essence. The viability of the clubs and indeed the future of the ISL and the Indian football ecosystem depends on immediate steps being placed before the Hon'ble Supreme Court. It is, therefore, imperative that the report of the Union of India and/or the AIFF on the actions proposed to be taken in respect of the issues highlighted herein be filed on or before 8 December 2025, so that the Court is apprised of the remedial pathway and commercial certainty can be restored without further delay,"" it added.The clubs expressed concern that any delay beyond the specified date could severely damage the football ecosystem developed over the past decade.AIFF responded by confirming they would forward the concerns to the Ministry of Sports and engage KPMG to develop solutions, including a possible re-tender.""The AIFF shall also put in all possible effort as per our AIFF Constitution to ensure ISL gets a long-term sustainable model for growth and development of Indian football. We are also forwarding this mail to KPMG to work on a suitable solution, including the possibility of issuing a re-tender keeping time constraints in mind,"" the letter read.The clubs have filed an Interim Application with the Supreme Court to address constitutional impediments affecting the tender process.""Should the Court process take time, we urge that the AIFF consider exercising this power with utmost urgency, in consultation with the Government where necessary, so that the sport is not imperilled by procedural delay.""The AIFF plans to hold its Annual General Body Meeting on December 20. A previous tender for selecting a new ISL commercial partner was unsuccessful.The clubs have suggested forming a consortium to operate the league if a new tender fails to attract suitable partners.""Such an approach is consistent with global best practices and reflective of the long-term commitment of the Clubs to Indian football,"" the clubs stated.""It must be conducted within a strict and non-extendable timeline, such that the process is completed well before the end of this month. Only a hard time-bound tender window of this nature provides any realistic opportunity to stabilise the commercial structure of the league and salvage the current season. Beyond the re-tender itself, we respectfully submit that a long-term solution must be formulated without delay. A temporary or stop-gap arrangement ... momentary relief but does not address the underlying structural issues.""","12 Indian Super League (ISL) clubs have approached the All India Football Federation (AIFF) with urgent concerns about the domestic football crisis.

Teams & tournament format

Lionel Messi hopes to participate as Argentina defend title

The 2026 FIFA World Cup draw ceremony will take place in Washington on Friday at the Kennedy Center, featuring U.S. President Donald Trump receiving the inaugural FIFA Peace Prize. The ceremony, starting at 1700 GMT, will include American sports stars and entertainment celebrities for the first-ever 48-team World Cup finals to be hosted across North America from June 11 to July 19.The expanded tournament will include 16 more teams than the 2022 Qatar World Cup, making it the most logistically complex World Cup in history. The matches will be played across 16 venues, with 11 in the United States, three in Mexico, and two in Canada.FIFA President Gianni Infantino has established a close relationship with Trump, who will receive the FIFA Peace Prize during the ceremony. According to Infantino, the award is ""to recognize the enormous efforts of those individuals who unite people, bringing hope for future generations.""Trump, who recently became chairman of the Kennedy Center, has made the World Cup a centerpiece event of both his second presidency and the 250th anniversary of U.S.independence next year. However, he has threatened to relocate World Cup matches from Democratic-run cities if he deems conditions unsafe.""I would call Gianni, the head of FIFA, who's phenomenal, and I would say, let's move it to another location. And he would do that,"" Trump stated recently.The star-studded ceremony will be co-hosted by supermodel Heidi Klum and actor-comedian Kevin Hart. It will feature performances by Village People, Andrea Bocelli, Nicole Scherzinger, and Robbie Williams, while sports icons Tom Brady, Wayne Gretzky, and Shaquille O'Neal will help conduct the draw.Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney and Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum will attend the ceremony. Iran initially threatened to boycott but later decided to send representatives, including head coach Amir Ghalenoei, after visa issues for some delegation members.Iranian Football Federation president Mehdi Taj criticized the U.S. visa decision as ""purely political"" before Iran's change of stance regarding ceremony attendance.The tournament's expansion has enabled first-time qualifiers like Cape Verde, Jordan, and Curacao to participate. FIFA's head of global football development Arsene Wenger defended the expansion, calling it a ""natural evolution"" and stating that 48 teams is ""the right number.""The teams will be divided into 12 groups of four, with the top two from each group and eight best third-placed teams advancing to the last 32. The draw will ensure the four highest-ranked nations - Spain, Argentina, France, and England - cannot meet before the semi-finals if they top their groups.Argentina, the reigning champions, will be among the top seeds alongside European champions Spain, Brazil, France, Germany, England, Portugal, the Netherlands, Belgium, and the three host nations.Lionel Messi, who will turn 39 during the tournament, expressed hope about participating. ""I hope I can be there. I've said before that I'd love to be there,"" Messi told ESPN.Six finals berths remain undecided and will be determined through playoffs. The playoff winners will be among the bottom seeds, potentially including Italy, who failed to qualify for the last two tournaments despite being World Cup winners in 2006.The opening match will be held at Mexico City's Azteca Stadium, with the final at the MetLife Stadium (NJ) outside New York City.

Inter Miami, led by Lionel Messi , will face the Vancouver Whitecaps in the Major League Soccer championship final on Saturday at Chase Stadium in Fort Lauderdale, where four World Cup winners including Messi, Thomas Mueller, Sergio Busquets, and Rodrigo De Paul will compete for domestic glory.The 38-year-old Argentine has guided Miami through an impressive playoff run, with the team scoring 17 goals in five games.Vancouver presents a formidable challenge with German star Thomas Mueller, who joined in August, enhancing their attacking prowess.Mueller has dismissed suggestions of a personal rivalry with Messi ahead of the final.""It's not about Messi against Thomas Mueller,"" Mueller stated after Vancouver's 3-1 victory in the Western Conference final. ""It's Miami against the Whitecaps.""Miami's journey to the final appeared unlikely in April when Javier Mascherano's team managed only two wins in eight games, including a 5-1 aggregate loss to Vancouver in the CONCACAF Champions Cup.At that time, broadcast analysts criticized the team harshly: ""They can't run, they can't defend, and there's not a balance in the team.""Miami has since undergone a remarkable transformation, strengthened by De Paul's addition in midfield and Mascherano's decision to start 19-year-old Mateo Silvetti over veteran Luis Suarez.Whitecaps coach Jesper Sorensen downplayed the significance of their earlier victories against Miami.""It almost seems like it was last season, right?"" Sorensen said. ""It's a new game. It's two teams that approach the game in their way, and we will see who comes out on top come Saturday.""Messi expressed confidence about playing the final at home in a rare interview with ESPN Argentina.""We're in a very good moment, the team is solid and excited,"" Messi said. ""Playing at home is a plus. Even though we went through a stretch where we were very inconsistent and struggled to win back-to-back games, at home we always stayed strong.""Mueller, who has historically dominated encounters with Messi, winning seven out of their ten meetings, including the 2014 World Cup final and Bayern Munich's 8-2 victory over Barcelona in the 2020 Champions League.""I look back in the past and I feel very comfortable with that, because that's already in the books, and I had a lot of great experience in these games with my teams, so it was fun,"" Mueller reflected on his previous matches against Messi. ""But it doesn't really matter for Saturday, it's a new game.""The final represents a clash between Miami's resurgent form and Vancouver's dynamic attack, with both teams aiming to write their names in MLS history.","Inter Miami will face Vancouver Whitecaps in Major League Soccer championship final.

Deion Sanders’ surprise Browns visit creates touching father-son moment amid Shedeur Sanders’ major NFL strides,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/deion-sanders-surprise-browns-visit-creates-touching-father-son-moment-amid-shedeur-sanders-major-nfl-strides/articleshow/125812521.cms,"Deion Sanders gave a Cleavland visit (Getty Images)

Shedeur Sanders shines in Cleveland, fueled by proud dad energy



Deion Sanders just made a headline-grabbing move, bringing Sacramento State’s Brennan Marion to Colorado as the new offensive coordinator. Marion’s rapid rise through the coaching ranks has many wondering if Coach Prime didn’t just hire a play-caller but might have landed a future head coach. His arrival signals a serious commitment to transforming an offense that struggled with consistency last season. With creativity, swagger, and a dynamic playbook in hand, Marion is expected to revitalize Colorado’s game plan and inject new energy into the program.The timing couldn’t be better. With Pat Shurmur’s contract expired, Colorado is betting big that Marion can finally get the offense on schedule. Known for motion-heavy schemes and inventive play-calling, he brings a fresh perspective that could turn the Buffaloes into one of the nation’s most exciting teams. Fans and analysts alike are watching closely, eager to see how Marion’s approach will translate on the field.Meanwhile, Deion Sanders’ son, Shedeur Sanders, is finding his stride as a rookie quarterback for the Cleveland Browns. Settling into the NFL’s pace, Shedeur is beginning to read defenses and control the field with growing confidence. Ahead of the Browns’ December 7 clash with the Titans, Deion shared a heartfelt Instagram post featuring his son inside the team facility, exuding what he called pure “PROUD DAD ENERGY.It read, “seen this in the @clevelandbrowns building and it made me smile like a DAD WOULD SMILE! I saw this pic online and @deionsandersjr was in the bottom corner and I smiled again. It was GODS way of saying ‘everything is gonna be alright’ like he said it would. #Dad”Shedeur’s journey hasn’t been without challenges. During training camp, he told his father, “Dad, I may get three, four reps at practice. I don't want you seeing that ... I'm not where I need to be yet. Let me get where I need to be.” His focus on earning respect independently highlights his determination to step out of his legendary father’s shadow. When a concussion to the starter finally thrust him onto the field, Deion admitted the moment was overwhelming: “I was in straight dad mode. I wasn't in coach mode and I loved that I was able to see him gain the first victory. I was in tears.”Shedeur’s accuracy, poise, and decision-making indicate that he could develop into a reliable starter in the coming seasons. With Coach Prime cheering from the sidelines and Marion innovating in Colorado, both Sanders and the teams they influence are set for a thrilling ride.Also Read: Kayla Nicole’s ‘wild’ bikini reveal sends weekend buzz soaring as Travis Kelce’s ex commands social media again","Brennan Marion is the new offensive coordinator for the Colorado Buffaloes.

Brittany Mahomes sends a clear message to fans as they question Patrick Mahomes’ legacy during tough season,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/brittany-mahomes-sends-a-clear-message-to-fans-as-they-question-patrick-mahomes-legacy-during-tough-season/articleshow/125812172.cms,"Patrick Mahomes faces scrutiny amid the Kansas City Chiefs' uncertain playoff outlook. NBA star Kevin Durant and Mahomes' wife, Brittany, have publicly defended the quarterback, dismissing claims of a ""down year"" and questioning his legacy. With playoff hopes on the line, Week 14 presents a crucial opportunity for Mahomes to silence critics and reaffirm his all-time status.

Brittany Mahomes cosigns Kevin Durant as he blasts critics calling Mahomes overrated

As the Kansas City Chiefs head into Week 14 with their most uncertain playoff outlook in years, the spotlight is shining brighter on Patrick Mahomes than ever before. A rare 6–6 record has fueled social media debates and TV chatter over whether the two-time NFL MVP is having his first “down year,” and some have gone as far as questioning his long-term legacy.For anyone in Mahomes’ circle, that idea sounds absurd. Leading the charge in shutting down the narrative is not only NBA superstar Kevin Durant, but also Mahomes’ biggest supporter, his wife, Brittany, who isn’t letting the internet rewrite a quarterback’s résumé over one rocky stretch.During an appearance on Up & Adams, Durant reacted in disbelief when asked if a struggling Chiefs season should affect how fans view Mahomes’ legacy. The Phoenix Suns forward immediately shut down the question.“What kind of a question is that? That makes no sense at all,” he said, refusing to let a single year overshadow a career that includes three Super Bowl titles. He continued, “If anybody is questioning Pat Mahomes legacy from a one-off year… I don’t give a damn. This man is Patrick Mahomes… potentially the greatest.”The clip went viral after host Kay Adams posted it to Instagram, where Brittany Mahomes quickly jumped into the comments to echo Durant’s defense, writing, “Let them know.”She didn’t need to say more; her agreement signaled that those closest to Mahomes are listening, and they’re not amused by the rush to judge.Kansas City’s playoff chances now hinge heavily on their Sunday Night Football matchup against the red-hot Houston Texans. A win boosts their postseason probability to 49%. A loss drags it down to a desperate 11%. Even Mahomes knows the stakes, telling reporters, “We’re going to have to throw it all out there and find a way to win… This will be a big game for us to showcase who we are.”Critics may be circling, but Mahomes has survived bigger moments with far less support around him. With urgency growing and his family and fans rallying behind him, Week 14 is shaping up to be more than a game, it’s a statement opportunity. And as Durant reminded everyone, one season won’t define a player already carving an all-time legacy.Also Read: Did Patrick and Brittany Mahomes unknowingly spark Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce’s love story?

Why did the NFL hit Isiah Pacheco with one of the season’s biggest fines for a routine helmet collision?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/why-did-the-nfl-hit-isiah-pacheco-with-one-of-the-seasons-biggest-fines-for-a-routine-helmet-collision/articleshow/125812206.cms,"Running back Isiah Pacheco was fined $46,371 for impermissibly lowering his helmet on a hit, a penalty not called during the game. This retroactive discipline, impacting other players too, highlights the NFL's strict enforcement of helmet contact rules, raising questions about player responsibility and the league's policing of instinctive plays.

League crackdown on helmet contact puts spotlight on unclear enforcement

Isiah Pacheco has earned a reputation as one of the most fearlessly physical running backs in the league, but his latest collision with Cowboys cornerback DaRon Bland brought a consequence many around the NFL didn’t see coming. Despite the play looking like a standard sideline hit, officials later ruled that Pacheco “impermissibly lowered his helmet,” leading to a hefty $46,371 fine.What makes the situation more controversial is that there was no penalty on the field, no special emphasis from commentators, and no visible concern from the Cowboys defense. It was the sort of moment that typically goes unnoticed, until the league decides it shouldn’t.This quiet crackdown by the NFL fuels a growing debate: how much responsibility should players bear for a split-second decision during a fast, instinctive play? And if the league interprets helmet use differently than the players executing those hits, where is the real line?The fine issued to Pacheco is not only far above the standard starting penalty of $22,500 for a first offense, it also raises suspicions that the NFL classified it as either a repeat violation or an “especially egregious” action. Yet to most watching, it wasn’t a crown-of-the-helmet blow or an intentional strike at all. It was a running back bracing for contact.This isn’t an isolated development. Similar fines have recently impacted Zach Charbonnet and Saquon Barkley, both disciplined retroactively despite no in-game flags. For players, it highlights a widening gap between how football feels in real time and how the NFL polices it after slow-motion review.The league says the rule enforces a broader goal of preventing head and neck trauma. That mission is valid, but the question now becomes whether the NFL can protect players without punishing the instinctive mechanics of the sport itself. For the Chiefs, Pacheco’s situation isn’t just a financial hit, it’s a reminder that even the most routine play can become a high-priced judgment call in today’s NFL.Also Read: Dak Prescott reflects on racist encounter before NFL draft while emerging as Dallas’ franchise leader","Isiah Pacheco was fined $46,371 for impermissibly lowering his helmet on a hit, a penalty not called during the game.

“Not what I dreamed of”: Gisele Bündchen reflects on her marriage to Tom Brady with honesty and acceptance years after their split,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/not-what-i-dreamed-of-gisele-bndchen-reflects-on-her-marriage-to-tom-brady-with-honesty-and-acceptance-years-after-their-split/articleshow/125804318.cms,"Gisele Bündchen reflected on her divorce from Tom Brady, emphasizing personal growth and acceptance over regret. She acknowledged grieving a future she envisioned but highlighted that couples can grow apart. Bündchen dismissed speculation about Brady's football comeback causing the split, focusing instead on gratitude for their children and the life they built.

A marriage she hoped would last, and a life she has learned to embrace

When Gisele Bündchen opened up about her divorce from Tom Brady in 2023, it marked one of the first times the supermodel allowed the public a genuine look at how she felt about the end of one of Hollywood’s most followed marriages. At that time, Bündchen had just turned 43 and was settling into a new rhythm outside of her 13-year marriage to the NFL legend.While the breakup sparked countless rumors, especially around Brady’s return to football, she made it clear that the truth was far more personal and less dramatic than tabloids wanted it to be. Looking back now, her reflections stand out not as regret, but as perspective shaped by growth, motherhood, and acceptance.In her interview with “CBS News Sunday Morning,” Bündchen didn’t portray herself as heartbroken or angry. Instead, she admitted to grieving a future she once imagined. “It’s not what I dreamed of and what I hoped for,” she said candidly, emphasizing that her parents’ 50-year marriage set the example she wished to follow.Yet her tone wasn’t bitter. It was reflective, acknowledging that time changes people, and not all unions last simply because they begin with love.She explained that life evolves and couples don’t always grow in the same direction. “Sometimes you grow together, sometimes you grow apart,” she reflected, a line that would later resonate with many women navigating similar transitions. After their divorce was finalized in 2022, Bündchen rejected public speculation that Brady’s football comeback caused their split, dismissing it as “the craziest thing I’ve ever heard. ”Instead, she focused on gratitude for their children and the life they built. “I mean, he’s the father of my kids, you know? So I always wish him the best,” she said, praising the family they created and the lessons gained from their marriage.Since then, Bündchen has built a new lifestyle prioritizing family, wellness, and independence, from creating a solar-powered home to co-parenting peacefully. Her perspective, especially now, offers a quiet reminder that endings don’t always carry sadness, sometimes they simply make room for a different kind of life, one she says she “wouldn’t change absolutely anything” about.Also Read: Tom Brady “got screwed” for ignoring the biggest red flag in his marriage: Gisele Bündchen’s past with Leonardo DiCaprio",Gisele Bündchen opened up about her divorce from Tom Brady in 2023.

Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce’s special wedding date carries a secret message to fans,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/taylor-swift-and-travis-kelces-special-wedding-date-carries-a-secret-message-to-fans/articleshow/125804246.cms,"Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce are reportedly planning their wedding for June 13, 2026, a date rich with personal symbolism for Swift. Sources suggest Swift secured the Ocean House venue by paying off another bride, highlighting the couple's deliberate approach to their relationship. The chosen date, with its numerological significance of closure and rebirth, aligns perfectly with Swift's thematic storytelling.

A wedding date that blends Taylor Swift’s favorite number and deeper symbolism

Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce ’s love story is heading toward a wedding that feels more like a carefully scripted chapter pulled from the singer’s own playbook. The couple, who got engaged in August, reportedly plans to marry on June 13, 2026, a date loaded with personal symbolism for Swift and now, as insiders suggest, history of its own.Sources claimed Swift was so determined to secure the date at the posh Ocean House in Watch Hill, Rhode Island, that she wrote a large check to the bride who had already booked it. The move fits the energy surrounding this relationship: intense, deliberate, and definitely not accidental. When Swift makes a choice, she doesn’t just circle a date on the calendar, she builds meaning around it.Swift isn’t shy about her fascination with the number 13. Born on December 13, it’s long been her symbolic compass, quietly sewn into her music, merchandise, and milestones. June 13 happens to be her half-birthday, and in a more layered twist, numerology fans online are buzzing over what the full date: 6/13/26, represents.If you add each number (6 + 1 + 3 + 2 + 6), the sum equals 18, and then 1 + 8 equals 9. According to Numerology.com, the number nine represents closure and rebirth, “completion in a cyclical sense… the ending of one cycle, which creates the potential for another to begin.”That symbolism hits a nerve with Swifties. For a woman whose albums thrive on themes of closure, rebirth, and transformation, choosing a date that numerology defines as the doorway to a new cycle feels like a calculated emotional narrative.It’s the kind of storytelling that echoes her songwriting; intentional, layered, and obsessed with easter eggs.Reports previously suggested Swift and Kelce initially planned a small, intimate ceremony but expanded the guest list after realizing just how many friends and family they wanted present. Now, they’re considering multiple locations, including the Ocean House, Swift’s nearby Rhode Island mansion, a Tennessee farm, or even a private Caribbean island.Whether the wedding unfolds as a dazzling spectacle or a high-security fairy tale, one thing seems certain: every detail, including the date, will mean something.Also Read: Did Patrick and Brittany Mahomes unknowingly spark Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce’s love story?

Game Impact and Entertainment Angle

The Texas rivalry between the Houston Rockets and the Dallas Mavericks is set to return on December 6, 2025, but instead of a clean star-driven contest, the matchup is shaping up to be a test of survival. Both teams enter the night carrying heavy injury baggage, forcing coaches to prepare improvised rotations and rely on depth pieces in a high-stakes Western Conference clash. Houston, sitting at an impressive 15-5, comes in as a -7.5 favorite, yet the second night of a back-to-back is expected to stretch their roster thin against a hungry Dallas squad desperate for stability.For the Mavericks, the storyline centers on whether their patchwork lineup can keep pace without their foundational scorers and rim protectors. With several starters sidelined or listed as questionable, Dallas will likely lean heavily on youth, hustle, and the unpredictability of their remaining core. The buildup to tip-off has become less about star duels and more about which team can survive a war of attrition.Houston’s absence list strikes directly at their frontcourt depth, leaving the Rockets without multiple key interior defenders. Steven Adams remains unavailable with right ankle tendinopathy, a lingering setback that rules him out until at least December 11.Alperen Sengun, the engine of Houston’s offense averaging 23.1 points, 9.1 rebounds, and 7.1 assists, enters doubtful due to illness, leaving Houston to rely on makeshift big-man combinations.Tari Eason continues recovering from a right oblique strain with hopes of returning in late December, while Dorian Finney-Smith’s left ankle surgery keeps his season debut pushed into January. Fred VanVleet’s absence looms large for Houston’s backcourt organization, as his right knee ACL repair could cost him the entire season. With their depth tested, Amen Thompson and Jabari Smith Jr. are expected to carry the scoring and pace, with Thompson bringing 17.9 points and 7.1 boards per game and Smith contributing 14.9 points with 2.0 made threes per night.Dallas Mavericks face an even more compromised roster. Kyrie Irving continues his ramp-up from left knee surgery, keeping their primary creator off the floor. Dante Exum remains out for the season with a right knee issue. The Mavericks’ center depth is depleted further as Dereck Lively II misses his eighth straight game due to right foot injury management, with no clear timeline for return. Daniel Gafford is listed doubtful with persistent right ankle soreness.P.J. Washington, one of Dallas’s most consistent forwards at 16.0 points and 7.8 rebounds, enters questionable with a right ankle sprain. Rookie standout Cooper Flagg is expected to play through a thumb splint, offering 17.2 points and much-needed defensive energy.With both center rotations decimated, the matchup is likely to shift into a guard-driven scramble. Houston will lean on Thompson’s burst and Smith’s shooting, while Dallas counters with Flagg’s dynamic two-way presence and Anthony Davis’s availability after recent knee concerns. Rebounding battles are expected to be chaotic, hinging on effort rather than size. Fans are tuning in not just for the rivalry, but to see whether Washington can push through his ankle issue or whether Houston’s depth will overwhelm a depleted Mavericks roster. The late-afternoon injury report sets the tone for a tense, unpredictable showdown.","The Houston Rockets host the Dallas Mavericks on December 6, 2025.

Milwaukee Bucks’ Injury Report vs the Detroit Pistons (December 6, 2025)

Detroit Pistons Injury Report vs the Milwaukee Bucks (December 6, 2025)

Season Impact for Milwaukee

The Milwaukee Bucks enter their rematch against the Detroit Pistons in a difficult spot, missing their franchise cornerstone on a night that was supposed to showcase a classic Eastern Conference clash. Instead, the spotlight shifts to how a shorthanded Milwaukee roster will cope against one of the league’s top teams.The Pistons, sitting comfortably near the top of the East, are expected to apply pressure early, especially after narrowly losing their previous meeting with Milwaukee. Without Giannis Antetokounmpo on the floor, the Bucks face a test not only of talent but of identity.Giannis Antetokounmpo will not play tonight due to a right calf strain, an injury that is projected to sideline him for at least two weeks. The star forward went down just three minutes into the Bucks’ recent home win over Detroit on December 3, slipping while transitioning to defense after assisting A.J. Green. He exited the game with only 2 points before limping to the locker room, sparking immediate concern about a potential Achilles injury.Imaging later confirmed a calf strain, easing early fears but still setting a 2-4 week recovery window that effectively wipes out Milwaukee’s December schedule, including this rematch.This setback follows a left adductor strain in November that already cost him four games, complicating what had been an MVP-caliber start to his season.Milwaukee Bucks’ issues extend beyond Giannis. A.J. Green is listed as questionable with a left shoulder contusion and may undergo additional evaluation, while Taurean Prince remains out indefinitely following neck surgery for a herniated disc. Alex Antetokounmpo is also unavailable due to G League commitments.Despite those obstacles, the Bucks managed to grind out a recent win over Detroit without their superstar, leaning on Jericho Sims’ 15-point, 14-rebound double-double alongside steady production from Kevin Porter Jr. and Ryan Rollins. Head coach Doc Rivers praised the resilient effort, calling the team’s response “tremendous.”Detroit enters at 18–5 with only minor injuries, Marcus Sasser remains out with a hip issue, and Bobi Klintman is sidelined by an ankle sprain. Key contributors Cade Cunningham, Jalen Duren, and Tobias Harris are all cleared to play. Cunningham is expected to match up with Porter Jr., while Duren faces Myles Turner in a battle of interior anchors.The Pistons aim to avenge their narrow loss in Milwaukee Bucks, where their typically dominant form sputtered late. Facing a depleted Bucks squad, Detroit sees an opportunity to reassert control atop the East.Giannis Antetokounmpo had been averaging around 29-31 points, 10–11 rebounds, and over 6 assists on elite efficiency before the injury, placing him firmly in MVP conversations. His absence raises questions about Milwaukee’s ability to stay competitive, and even sparked trade speculation linking him to the Knicks and Spurs, rumors Rivers quickly dismissed. Tonight will reveal whether the Bucks’ supporting cast can steady the ship or if Detroit capitalizes on Milwaukee’s chaos.","Giannis Antetokounmpo will not play tonight due to a right calf strain.

Chicago Bulls’ injury nightmare worsens as Noa Essengue’s season ends abruptly

Bulls’ struggles grow as Essengue’s strong G-League form is halted by injury

In a matter of days, they went from being at the top of the Eastern Conference to being relegated to the play-in spots. The Chicago Bulls' season has been a real roller coaster. Furthermore, Chicago has battled with several injuries, which have limited the rotation. Now comes another huge setback: the season-ending loss of one of their best promising prospects.Rookie Noa Essengue, taken 12th overall in the NBA Draft, has seen his progress interrupted abruptly. According to reports from the United States, Essengue sustained the injury during a game with the Windy City Bulls, where he had been performing well and prepared for a gradual integration later this year.The Chicago Bulls are facing two tough truths. A five-game losing streak and numerous players out with injury. One of the athletes is Noa Essengue, an 18-year-old rookie. However, his season ended due to shoulder surgery, according to the NBA.The official notice of the team read:“Noa Essengue Medical Update Chicago Bulls forward Noa Essengue will undergo left shoulder surgery and be out for the remainder of the season. Updates will be provided as appropriate…”Additionally, according to head coach Billy Donovan, he saw an issue and asked Essengue to solve it straight away.“I think the recommendation was to get it fixed now instead of waiting, because it’s something that could continue to be a problem for him… The decision was made pretty much some time today.”With a great 6-1 start, Chicago appeared to be on a new path right away. They are now between the ages of 9 and 12, and the situation appears dismal.Injuries are obviously a factor. Many of its important players, including Coby White, Josh Giddey, Ayo Dosunmu, Patrick Williams, Isaac Okoro, and Kevin Huerter, have been sidelined due to injuries.The Bulls are also without forwards Coby White (left calf strain), Kevin Huerter (left hamstring strain), Zach Collins (left scaphoid fracture), and Jalen Smith (left hamstring strain), as well as guards Isaac Okoro and Tre Jones.On November 22, Essengue made his Bulls debut against the Washington Wizards. Overall, he went 0-for-3 from the field and played six minutes in two games. He played 30.8 minutes per game with the NBA G League's Windy City Bulls, averaging 23 points and 8.5 rebounds.Essengue was the No. 12 pick in the NBA Draft this summer, coming from France. Chicago suffered a 113-103 setback to the Brooklyn Nets on Wednesday. On Friday, they will face the Indiana Pacers, followed by the Golden State Warriors on Sunday.Essengue averaged 23 points, 8.5 rebounds, and 30.8 minutes per game while playing for the G-League Windy City Bulls. In addition, the Bulls fell to 9-12 with their fifth consecutive loss. Chicago played minus seven injured players, including Essengue.Also read: When did Derrick Rose retire?

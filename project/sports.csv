Smriti Mandhana's Father And Fiance Palash Muchhal Rushed To Hospital, Wedding Postpones!

Look who is back! Virat Kohli arrives for the ODI series vs South Africa

NEW DELHI: Social media speculation claiming that Indian cricketer Smriti Mandhana had unfollowed her fiancé, Palash Muchhal , on Instagram has turned out to be incorrect. Their wedding, originally scheduled for September 23, was postponed due to medical emergencies involving both families.A verification by TOI Sports confirmed that Mandhana is still following Muchhal on Instagram, despite screenshots circulating online suggesting otherwise.However, Mandhana has taken down all wedding-related posts from her social media platforms.The decision to postpone the wedding was made after Mandhana’s father developed heart-attack-like symptoms during breakfast on the morning of the ceremony and was rushed to Sarvhit Hospital.Just a day later, Palash also suffered health complications and required medical attention.With Mandhana’s father still under observation, both families mutually agreed to delay the wedding until he and Palash fully recover.Palash’s mother, Amita Muchhal, told the Hindustan Times that her son had already been considering postponement even before Mandhana made the decision.""Palash is very emotionally attached to Smriti's father, Shrinivas Mandhana.Their relationship is even closer than the Smriti-Palash chemistry,"" Amita Muchhal said.She explained that Palash became extremely distressed after the haldi ceremony when Mandhana’s father fell ill, which triggered his own health issues. He required around four hours of medical care, including an IV drip and ECG tests. While his reports have since returned to normal, he continues to experience stress-related symptoms.The wedding has now been postponed indefinitely as both families prioritise recovery and well-being. Despite ongoing social media rumours of a breakup, the families have clarified that the delay is due solely to medical circumstances.","Smriti Mandhana has taken down all wedding-related posts from her social media platforms.

NEW DELHI: India allrounder Ravindra Jadeja said on Tuesday that the likely series loss to South Africa will not influence India’s next Test assignment in Sri Lanka in August next year. He added that managing to draw the second Test would feel like a ""win"" for the young side.India are on the verge of losing the two-Test series, with a target of 549 to chase on the final day.""I don't think it will affect the next series. But, as a cricketer, nobody wants to lose the series, especially in India. So, hopefully, we will try our best cricket. We will try to put our best foot forward tomorrow,"" Jadeja, who has taken seven wickets in the match, said after fourth day's play.""Hopefully, we will try and save the Test match. So that, at least, I know even if we aren't winning the series at least, we are able to draw the match, which is going to be a win-win situation for us.""Jadeja, who turns 37 in a few weeks, said a defeat will still help the younger players in the squad learn. India’s XI includes several players early in their Test careers — Yashasvi Jaiswal, Sai Sudharsan, Nitish Kumar Reddy, Dhruv Jurel and Washington Sundar.""Look, the youngsters in the team, I think, they are in a learning phase. Their careers are starting. So, in international cricket, no matter what format you play, it's not easy.No matter what format you play, it's always a bit challenging.""He said the inexperience of young players attracts more attention when the team loses at home.""So, in India, when a situation like this happens, and you play 3-4 youngsters in the team, it feels like the whole team is young and inexperienced. And that gets highlighted. But, when India wins in home condition, people think that it's not a big deal. But, if you lose a series in India, it becomes a very big deal,"" the all-rounder said.""For a youngster, it's a learning phase. If they handle this situation well, they will mature as players. And, India's future will be better.""Jadeja said India got the tough end of the conditions after batting first.""See, honestly, as a bowler, when we were bowling for the first two days, there were no marks on the wicket. The wicket was shining like a mirror. And, when they (South Africa) came to bowl, because of the wicket taken by the fast bowler, the spinners came into play more. And, their ball was turning and bouncing,"" he said.He added that once India conceded a 288-run first-innings lead, South Africa’s batters played without pressure.""So, as I said, the situation matters a lot in cricket. If it were the other way around, if we were 300 runs ahead and they came to bat, then it's possible that we would have won by a large margin.""Jadeja said the batters need to ignore the first four days and focus only on the final day.""For us, tomorrow will be very important as a batting unit that we keep ourselves in a positive frame of mind and try to play the whole day.""","India are on the verge of losing the two-Test series, with a target of 549 to chase on the final day.

India vs Pakistan again at an ICC event; T20 World Cup schedule is out!

Former India captain Anil Kumble grabbed headlines from the commentary box on Tuesday, but not merely for his analysis. The cricketing legend drew attention for a spontaneous mimicry of KL Rahul ’s costly shot during the closing stages of Day 4 in the second Test against South Africa at Guwahati, a moment that quickly went viral across social media.As India’s hopes of salvaging the match dwindled, Rahul’s dismissal to Simon Harmer sparked a visible reaction from Kumble . On air, he recreated Rahul’s misjudged attempt to flick a sharply turning off-spinner, a gesture that was instantly clipped and shared, creating a buzz among fans.The incident occurred when Harmer, introduced late in the session to exploit the rough outside the right-hander’s off stump, delivered a ball brimming with drift and bounce. Rahul, on 6, came forward assuming he could drive the delivery but misjudged the length. The ball gripped the surface, turned sharply, and struck his stumps, leaving India at 27/2 in a daunting chase of 522.Analyzing the shot, Kumble praised Harmer’s delivery while critiquing Rahul’s approach. “Simon Harmer bowled a brilliant off-spinner with plenty of dip and revolutions. KL committed too early and didn’t get to the pitch, which left him exposed,” he said.Kumble also noted how experienced batters typically adjust on deteriorating pitches. “On fourth- or fifth-day surfaces with rough outside off, you usually protect all three stumps, as the LBW risk is minimal. KL covered the centre, but his off-stump remained vulnerable,” he explained.The former leg-spinner broke down Rahul’s stance further, explaining that his guard forced him to stretch unnecessarily. “Standing on middle-and-off helps smother balls, but middle-and-leg pushes you out, exposing your off-stump. That’s what happened here,” Kumble said.Summing up, he acknowledged the lapse but credited the bowler: “He probably thought it was a drivable length, but the dip deceived him. Harmer executed it perfectly, and KL played a shot he shouldn’t have.”",Anil Kumble's mimicry of KL Rahul's costly shot went viral on social media.

Smriti Mandhana's Father And Fiance Palash Muchhal Rushed To Hospital, Wedding Postpones!

NEW DELHi: India cricketer Smriti Mandhana ’s father was suddenly hospitalised with heart-attack–like symptoms on Sunday, forcing the family to postpone the much-awaited wedding. A day later, reports emerged that groom-to-be Palash Muchhal had also been rushed to a hospital in Sangli after breaking down under emotional stress.Palash has since returned to Mumbai and is “resting and recovering”, his mother Amita Muchhal said, while revealing how the emotional turmoil around Smriti's father's health took a severe toll on her son.“Palash ko uncle se bahut zyada attachment hai… Smriti se zyada yeh dono close hain,” she told Hindustan Times, describing how deeply Palash is connected to Shrinivas Mandhana. “Jab unko hogaya toh Smriti se phele Palash ne decision liya ke phere nahi karne jab tak uncle thik nahi ho jaate.” According to her, even before Smriti, it was Palash who insisted the wedding must be halted until her father recovered.Amita recounted the frightening moments leading up to the hospitalisation: “Rote rote ek dum tabiyat kharab ho gai… stress bahut hai. They had to keep him in the hospital for four hours. IV drip chadi, ECG hua, aur doosre tests hoye.Sab normal aaye, but the stress was just too much,” she said. Since the haldi ceremony had already taken place, the family had asked Palash to stay indoors — but the emotional pressure overtook him.The couple were set to get married in Sangli on November 23, but everything changed when Smriti's father, Shrinivas, suddenly fell ill and was rushed to Sarvhit Hospital. Doctors later told ANI that his symptoms were likely triggered by “physical or mental stress” from the hectic wedding preparations.Amita described how joyous he had been the previous day: “Ek din phele bahut dance kiya… Instagram pe Stories dal rahe the. But while we were planning the baraat, he suddenly felt discomfort. Pehle bataya nahi… jab badhne lagi, ambulance bulai.”Only the pheras were left when the families realised they had no choice but to postpone the wedding.“Smriti and Palash dono takleef mein hain… Palash dreamt of coming home with his bride. I had even planned a special welcome,” she said, adding that she cancelled all remaining functions for November 24.Despite the emotional setback, Amita remains hopeful: “Everything will be fine… shaadi bohot jaldi hogi.”","Smriti Mandhana's father, Shrinivas, rushed to hospital with heart-attack-like symptoms.

India ODI squad: Bizarre selection calls, no explanation and no logic

Former India captain and former head coach Ravi Shastri pulled no punches as he criticised India’s first-innings batting approach during the second Test against South Africa in Guwahati. India, who have experimented with multiple players at the number 3 slot in recent times, raised eyebrows again when Washington Sundar was promoted to that position in the opening Test. For the second match, Sai Sudharsan returned to the XI and reclaimed the spot, pushing Sundar all the way down to number 8.The reshuffle did little to help India’s cause. Their batting faltered once more, and the side folded for 201 in response to South Africa’s commanding 489.Speaking on commentary for the Star network, Shastri strongly questioned the team’s planning and clarity.“Absolutely not. It makes no sense. I can’t figure out the reasoning. When they review this series, some of these selections will leave them puzzled. In Kolkata you picked four spinners and one of them bowled only a single over, when you could’ve easily picked a specialist batter. And here, after making Washington bat at three in the last Test, you could’ve slotted him at four today since you already had your number three. He’s not a number eight. He’s much better than that,” the former all-rounder remarked.Despite the chaos at the top, Sundar and Kuldeep Yadav did put up a fight, adding 72 valuable runs for the eighth wicket after India had slumped to 122 for 7 at the Barsapara Stadium. Their resistance helped India scrape past 200, but the deficit still ballooned to a massive 288.Sundar fell for a gritty 48 off 92 deliveries, while Kuldeep hung in for 19 off 134 balls.For South Africa, Marco Jansen dominated with the ball, returning outstanding figures of 6 for 48. Simon Harmer supported him well with a three-wicket haul for 64.","Former India captain and former head coach Ravi Shastri criticised India's first-innings batting approach during the second Test against South Africa in Guwahati.

Poll Do you think India's Test team is missing Virat Kohli's leadership? Yes, absolutely No, they need to move on

NEW DELHI: Former Royal Challengers Bengaluru wicketkeeper-batter Shreevats Goswami has ignited a fresh debate around India's leadership and direction in red-ball cricket, saying the team desperately misses the “energy and belief” that defined Virat Kohli 's era. His remarks came as India suffered yet another batting implosion against South Africa in the second Test in Guwahati.In a strongly worded post on X, Goswami said Kohli's retirement from Tests came too soon and the format “misses him” far more than ODIs.""Ideally Virat should have left playing ODIs & continued playing Test cricket until he had nothing to give. Test cricket misses him. Not just as a player but just the energy he brought, the love & passion playing for India where he made the team believe that they can win in any condition,"" he wrote as India faltered once again at home.His comments reflect the growing frustration around India's red-ball slide. After a shocking series defeat to New Zealand last year, the Rishabh Pant-led side now faces the prospect of another home series loss — this time to South Africa, who haven't won a Test series in India since 2000.On the field, towering left-arm quick Marco Jansen produced a devastating spell of 6/48 to bowl India out for 201, giving South Africa complete command.India, replying to 489, crumbled to 122/7 before Washington Sundar and Kuldeep Yadav briefly resisted, but the damage had long been done.With South Africa ending day three at 26/0 and extending their overall lead to 314, India are staring at a fifth home defeat in seven Tests — a stark contrast to the invincible aura once associated with Kohli's reign.As Goswami's post continues to gain traction, it echoes a sentiment that many fans and former players now share: India's Test team looks adrift, and the void left by Kohli feels bigger than ever.",Former Royal Challengers Bengaluru wicketkeeper-batter Shreevats Goswami has ignited a fresh debate around India's leadership and direction in red-ball cricket.

NEW DELHI: India’s long-anticipated bid to host the 2030 Commonwealth Games is set to receive formal approval on Wednesday at the Commonwealth Sport General Assembly in Glasgow — a move that will officially bring the multi-sport extravaganza back to the country after 20 years and mark a major leap in India’s ambitions to become a global sporting hub.Although the hosting rights were all but assured over a month ago, Wednesday’s vote will put the final seal on what the Commonwealth Sport Board has already recommended after a detailed evaluation process. The review assessed candidate cities on technical delivery, infrastructure, governance, athlete experience, and alignment with the movement’s core values.Ahmedabad emerged as the preferred host city over Abuja, Nigeria. Commonwealth Sport has decided to work with Abuja for a strengthened bid for 2034, citing plans to “support and accelerate” Africa’s hosting ambitions.During the Assembly, India will make a final presentation outlining its vision for the “Amdavad” Games. A formal announcement is expected around 6:30 pm IST, with India represented by Joint Secretary (Sports) Kunal, IOA President PT Usha , and Gujarat Sports Minister Harsh Sanghavi.Calling it a defining point in the Commonwealth movement’s 100-year history, the organisation said the approval would be followed by a “unique broadcast moment”.Hosting the 2030 Games would be a significant milestone as India eyes an even bigger goal — the 2036 Olympic Games, also proposed to be staged in Ahmedabad. The city has rapidly expanded its sports infrastructure, including the massive Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Sports Enclave, anchored by the world’s largest cricket stadium.Ahmedabad has recently hosted major international events, including the Commonwealth Weightlifting Championships and the Asian Aquatics Championships, and will stage the World Police and Fire Games in 2029.With Glasgow 2026 scaling down its programme due to budget constraints, India has assured a full-strength roster for 2030, including medal-rich sports like shooting, wrestling, hockey, kabaddi and kho kho. “The plan is to have all our medal-earning sports,” IOA joint secretary Kalyan Chaubey had said earlier.The approval will officially return the Games to India for the first time since Delhi 2010.Commonwealth Sport last month said India’s bid demonstrates “the scale and diversity of modern sport”, acknowledging the nation’s rich sporting history and fourth-place finish at the 2022 Birmingham Games.","Ahmedabad emerged as the preferred host city over Abuja, Nigeria.

Family statements highlight emotional toll

No rescheduled date yet

Indian women’s cricket vice-captain Smriti Mandhana ’s wedding celebrations in Sangli, Maharashtra, were abruptly halted on Sunday when her father, Shrinivas Mandhana , fell seriously ill. Hospitalised immediately, his condition forced the couple to postpone the much-anticipated ceremony. Mandhana’s business manager, Tuhin Mishra, confirmed that the decision to halt proceedings was made by the cricketer herself, prioritising her father’s recovery. “Smriti is very close to her father. She decided that until her father gets well, this marriage… is indefinitely postponed,” Mishra said.Initially feared to be a heart attack, Mandhana’s father was later diagnosed with angina. Dr Naman Shah, the family physician, explained that Shrinivas experienced left-sided chest pain, with elevated cardiac enzyme readings and high blood pressure prompting hospital observation. “If the situation exacerbates, we will have to do angiography,” Dr Shah noted, adding that his condition was being closely monitored.In a stressful turn, Mandhana’s fiancé Palash Muchhal was also admitted to a hospital shortly after her father’s illness.He was treated for viral symptoms and acidity issues, though his condition was not serious. Following initial treatment in Sangli, Palash has been moved to Mumbai for rest and recovery, under the watchful eye of his family.Following the events, Mandhana deleted all wedding-related posts from her Instagram, including her proposal video. Her teammates and close friends, including Jemimah Rodrigues , Shreyanka Patil, and Radha Yadav, also removed or unfollowed related content, fueling speculation among fans. Mandhana’s older casual posts featuring Palash remain unaffected.Palash’s sister, singer Palak Muchhal , requested privacy for the families during this difficult time. Meanwhile, Palash’s mother, Amita Muchhal, revealed the depth of her son’s bond with Mandhana’s father. “Palash is extremely attached to Smriti’s father, even more than Smriti herself. When he fell ill, Palash immediately insisted that the wedding be postponed until he recovered,” she explained. Amita also described Palash’s brief hospitalisation, where he received an IV drip, ECG, and other tests after stress took a toll on his health.As of now, neither Smriti Mandhana nor Palash Muchhal has confirmed a new wedding date. Both families remain focused on Shrinivas Mandhana’s recovery and the couple’s emotional well-being.","Indian women's cricket vice-captain Smriti Mandhana’s wedding celebrations in Sangli, Maharashtra, were abruptly halted on Sunday.

Guwahati:

India fans in Guwahati are behind the hosts, expect a fightback on Day 3

“To borrow a phrase, we wanted them to really grovel.” When South African coach Shukri Conrad uttered these words after stumps on Day Four, the press room was left stunned. The Indian team and its peripheral contingent, used to believing that they are the bosses of world cricket, couldn’t believe what they were hearing.Tony Greig’s infamous, racist jibe ahead of the 1976 series against West Indies was answered by the Caribbean ‘fire in Babylon’ that resulted in a 3-0 win for Clive Lloyd’s team. But there isn’t enough fire in Barsapara in Gautam Gambhir ’s boys to shout out loud at the end of the series: “Who’s grovelling now?”The Proteas, on the verge of a historic series win against India at the Assam Cricket Association ground, made India very hard through the fourth day. Sitting on a mountainous 288-run first innings lead, the visitors piled on 260-5 in the second innings, killing off any hopes of an Indian fightback.As the shadows got longer, a young Indian fan cried out, “Please bat, I have tickets for Day 5!” India limped to 27-2, needing another 522 runs to win. Everyone knows the eventual outcome on a deteriorating pitch. The best India can hope for is a draw, but only if the batters can bat out of their skins.Going by the evidence of the last hour’s play on Tuesday, that would be as good as a miracle.The pitch, with its natural wear and tear, has started to misbehave, with a few deliveries keeping low. Six-foot-eight Marco Jansen already seems to be in his element after the first-innings heroics, removing Yashasvi Jaiswal, who once again fell to the cut shot. The ball kept a little low, got the edge of Jaiswal’s bat, and the ’keeper Kyle Verreynne celebrated after completing the catch.The bigger worry for India could be around KL Rahul’s mode of dismissal. Offie Simon Harmer , pitching one just outside Rahul’s off-stump, turned the ball 6.1 degrees, which was a clear 2 degrees more than the turn that the Indian spinners managed on Day Four. The ball went through the gate, and Rahul’s dismissal late in the day was a huge blow for India’s chances of survival. Sai Sudharsan survived a very close leg-before shout, among a few other anxious moments, with night-watchman Kuldeep Yadav for company.“The pitch is turning and bouncing, and batting is not getting any easier. It will get tougher on Day Five, and we will have to apply ourselves to manage a draw. Obviously we can’t win it, but even if it’s a draw, it will feel like a win,” Ravindra Jadeja said at the end of the day’s play.Jadeja (4/62) became the fifth Indian to take 50 wickets against South Africa, but it was hardly a bother for the visitors, who went on with their merry ways. Probably the quick turn that Jadeja was getting in the second session would be a bigger worry for India than it was for South Africa.With the pressure of runs completely gone, the South African middle order weathered the slightly difficult moments and carried on with the charge. Tristan Stubbs (94) took the maximum toll of a demoralized Indian attack, while left-hander Tony de Zorzi (49) showed how to deal with spin on a track like this. He came down the track and forced the spinners to over-compensate with a slightly fuller length. Immediately, the southpaw unleashed his sweep, and there wasn’t much Washington Sundar, Jadeja, and Kuldeep Yadav could do about it.“When the pressure of run scoring or survival goes away, things become much easier. If we had won the toss, it could have been the same for us,” Jadeja said, trying to defend his team’s predicament.As South Africa carried on batting in the final session, one felt whether they were delaying their declaration just a little too much. But South Africa wanted to ensure that the series was wrapped up and that they get to use the new ball under fading light.Coach Conrad was slightly miffed when asked whether the declaration was delayed. “There’s no right or wrong to this. We wanted to use the new ball under lengthening shadows and have the newish ball for tomorrow as well,” he said. The coach followed it up with the ‘grovel’ bit, and it’s to be seen whether the Indian batters figure out the historical context of the ‘insult’ and manage a draw that helps them get a few crucial points in the run-up to the WTC Final.","South Africa on verge of historic series win against India at Assam Cricket Association ground.

Look who is back! Virat Kohli arrives for the ODI series vs South Africa

Guwahati: It was during the first Test in Kolkata that Jasprit Bumrah referred to South African captain Temba Bavuma as “bauna (dwarf)” — with another choicest expletive to go with it — while discussing a probable DRS consultation with his teammates. The cameras caught it but when Bavuma was asked about it, he simply didn’t react. On Tuesday in Barsapara, it was South Africa’s turn to return the favour, albeit equally innocuously.To a very casual question about whether South Africa delayed their declaration on Tuesday, their coach Shukri Conrad gave the ‘grovel’ quote, which has deep historical context in cricket. Conrad seemed aware of what he was saying, and one is completely within his rights to try and imagine whether this was his way of hitting back at the ‘bauna’ jibe. It’s to be seen how Cricket South Africa, the biggest proponents of antiracism, react to their ‘coloured’ coach’s jibe.That’s all about the off-field battle. On the field too, South Africa have well and truly vanquished the Indian team. After 25 years, they’re now on the doorstep of a series win in India and the only question is whether they can make it a ‘whitewash’. It will also cap off a superb tour of the subcontinent for the South Africans, who drew 1-1 in Pakistan before this series.These results will be a massive boost for South Africa looking forward to a second consecutive WTC Final berth.“I think the big prep was before the Pakistan series and we had a couple of days camp where we tried to mimic the conditions. We sent the Test boys back after the Pak series for them to stay nice and fresh for this because this was going to be a big series,” Conrad said. The coach felt that the biggest reason for his team to put up such a fight against Pakistan and India was the quality of the spinners that they have. “We’ve got quality spinners who are not necessarily better but probably slightly better equipped than the Indian spinners in these conditions,” Conrad said.He was referring to the Barsapara track, where the South African spinners bowled slightly slower through the air and extracted more turn than the Indians. “Our spinners are not used to bowling on massively responsive pitches and look to bowl with a little more guile and variation and that certainly stood us in good stead here.”The best thing about this performance for South Africa was the fact that they did it without Kagiso Rabada, their premier paceman who was nursing a rib injury. Marco Jansen stepped up and delivered and the coach said that “it’s the beauty of this team that somebody or the other stands up”. “We could see how gutted he was after he missed the century, but he just delivered when it was needed,” the coach referred to the crucial breakthroughs that the tall paceman got in both the Tests.The icing on the cake for South Africa will be a 2-0 result and that will help them emulate what Hansie Cronje ’s boys did in 2000.","Jasprit Bumrah referred to South African captain Temba Bavuma as ‘bauna (dwarf)’ during the first Test in Kolkata.

Cricket’s First Landing

Ask any cricket fan where India’s first One Day International on home ground was, and you’ll likely hear Mumbai, Kolkata or Delhi. The correct answer reveals something essential about how Indian cricket has evolved, not through its traditional power centres, but through unlikely pioneers. On Nov 25, 1981, it was Ahmedabad’s Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Stadium that hosted this historic match. The venue was newly built and lacked conventional infrastructure — spectators sat on wooden planks and concrete steps; manual scoreboards were updated after every over; and the sight screen was a cloth strung up by local mandap decorators. But the enthusiasm was unparalleled. Between 25,000 and 30,000 people queued through the night for the privilege of witnessing India’s entry into a format that would eventually redefine cricket in the subcontinent.The selection of Ahmedabad stumped local cricketers. “Initially, we were surprised to learn that Ahmedabad was getting a chance to host such a major international match,” recalls Anil Patel, then a first-class cricketer and now Gujarat Cricket Association (GCA) secretary. “Previously, we had Ranji Trophy and Irani Trophy matches at Sardar Patel Stadium.” Mrugesh Jaykrishna, who served as both Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) vice-president and GCA leader, was instrumental in the decision.“As BCCI’s VP and a GCA leader, I took part in cricketing decisions, including where matches are allocated. I was very well-placed to influence cricket infrastructure and to push for Gujarat to host international cricket,” the 84-year-old recalls. “GCA saw this as an opportunity to host a marquee match and raise its profile. In short, it was partly infrastructure (Ahmedabad had a decent ground), partly timing (ODIs gaining importance), and partly opportunistic (first ODI in India) that resulted in Ahmedabad getting the edge. ”The very existence of the match represented a compromise. BCCI feared ODIs would diminish Test cricket’s importance. The board, says cricket writer Suresh Menon , was apprehensive that Test cricket might lose relevance. Players, too, considered Tests as the ultimate format. “England’s management insisted on including ODIs in the tour. BCCI was initially reluctant but conceded under pressure, and Ahmedabad was chosen as one of the venues,” Jaykrishna says. Even the match length became a negotiation: “The English management proposed a 45-over-per-side match, citing ‘short day, cold night,’ but BCCI insisted on 50 overs originally. Ultimately, a consensus was reached, and the match was cut to 46 overs per side.”The historic occasion, however, nearly didn’t happen. “A rumour was floated that the tour would be called off,” Menon recalls. “The then Indira Gandhi govt objected to the inclusion of Geoffrey Boycott and Geoff Cook in the English team.” Both had played in South Africa despite the country being banned by the ICC in 1970 because of its apartheid policies. “Gandhi was in Mexico on a foreign trip, and a decision would be taken after her return. The impasse was resolved less than a week before the team departed, when the two players concerned let it be known they were opposed to apartheid.”With the political crisis resolved, Ahmedabad faced an enormous practical challenge. “We had only 15-20 days to prepare the ground,” recalls Jayshree Patdiwala, wife of the late Rajendra Patdiwala, who was stadium in-charge. “The grass was so high that chopping alone took seven to eight days. We used a long sword/sickle to cut the grass and worked day and night to get the ground ready.”The stadium’s condition reflected the compressed timeline. “At that time, the stadium was not fully constructed,” explains Kalpesh Patdiwala, Rajendra’s son and a former Ranji player. “There were no seats but only steps or benches to sit on. There were wooden planks all around.” Without modern infrastructure, the organisers had to improvise. “The scorecard was manual and kept on the side. Two or three people used to sit on it,” Patel describes. “Placards used to be put on the board to showcase the number of runs scored and the target in the second innings. It used to be changed after every over. BCCI’s official scorer for the match was manually maintaining the scoresheet in a big book.”“The sight screen was made from cloth, with mandap decorators erecting temporary structures to hold it up,” Patel adds. Seating was equally makeshift — wooden benches designed for seven routinely accommodated 10 as spectators squeezed together.The response from the public was overwhelming. “Fans slept overnight outside the stadium to get tickets,” Kalpesh remembers. “Only local police were there to manage the crowd. There was a mad rush, and the mood was like a festival.” Around 25,000-30,000 spectators packed the stadium, creating an electric atmosphere. “There was no awareness about ODIs as a concept those days, but people just wanted to be part of the spectacle,” Patdiwala notes.When play began on Nov 25, conditions heavily favoured the bowling side. “In those days, 50-over games used to start at 9am. It was difficult to negotiate for the team batting first because there was dew on the wicket and dampness,” explains Dilip Vengsarkar. “Winning the toss was crucial.” England won that crucial toss and invited India to bat. The start was disastrous: openers Sunil Gavaskar (who captained the side) and Kris Srikkanth were both dismissed for ducks.“When we lost a couple of wickets, my intention was to see the new ball off and then improvise,” recalls Vengsarkar, who top-scored with 46. “Unfortunately, we didn’t have enough partnerships.”Kirti Azad contributed 30, while debutant Ravi Shastri scored 19 and Syed Kirmani 18* as India managed 156/7 in their 46 overs. Ian Botham (2/20) and Derek Underwood (2/18) were the pick of the England bowlers. England’s chase proved comfortable. Mike Gatting’s 47* and Botham’s unbeaten 25, which included two sixes that had the crowd roaring, guided them to a five-wicket victory with 13 balls to spare. “Roger Binny bowled brilliantly and Ravi Shastri kept things tight,” Vengsarkar notes, “but Gatting batted well and his match-winning stand with Botham sealed the match for England. ”Ahmedabad’s effort in successfully hosting the match earned widespread appreciation. “England won, following which the visiting captain, Keith Fletcher, gave a medal to my father,” Kalpesh reveals. “He said the pitch was very good and they enjoyed playing on it.” “We had a function after the match where both teams were invited,” Vengsarkar adds. “It was an amazing crowd. The atmosphere was electrifying considering the historic occasion. ” For participants like Kirti Azad, the occasion left its mark: “I remember scoring runs in that match. It was a very memorable and historic moment.”The choice of Ahmedabad carried historical weight. Gujarat’s cricketing roots run deeper than most realise. It was at Cambay, the port town nearest to Ahmedabad, that India first encountered cricket. An East India Company fleet brought the game in the early 18th century. Lieutenant General Clement Downing, who led the fleet, documented how sailors played the game during a stopover, while locals gathered to watch. His 1737 book, ‘A Compendious History of the Indian Wars’, provides the earliest recorded account of cricket on Indian soil. The region that had connected India to global trade routes through its merchants now connected the nation to what would become its greatest passion.Nearly 250 years later, Ahmedabad was ready to make history again. And it was just the beginning for the city, which went on to host the 2011 World Cup quarter-final, India’s 1,000th ODI in 2022, and the 2023 World Cup final. From cloth sight screens to world-class infrastructure, the transformation took four decades. But what Nov 25, 1981, proved still holds: history doesn’t wait for perfect conditions. Sometimes it just needs a city willing to clear the grass and open the gates.",Ahmedabad's Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Stadium hosted first ODI in 1981.

Look who is back! Virat Kohli arrives for the ODI series vs South Africa

NEW DELHI: Former India cricketer Suresh Raina said he is looking forward to Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli returning for the ODI series against South Africa. He said their comeback will make India very strong and pointed to their consistent performances.Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli are part of India's squad for the three-match ODI series, which starts in Ranchi on November 30.Speaking to news agency ANI, Raina referred to Rohit Sharma’s hundred against Australia in the third ODI in October. He also said he wished the two had played more matches earlier, while adding that it was their personal decision.""Rohit scored a brilliant hundred. When RoKo (Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli) return, it will be difficult to stop them because of the way they perform. I think both of them should have been there. I think they could have played a little more. But it's a personal call,"" Suresh Raina said.Raina said Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli may play the 2027 ODI World Cup and that their presence gives confidence to the team and supporters. He said he hopes they will guide India to an ODI series win in South Africa.""The World Cup is in 2027 and we'll have to see how things pan out because when Rohit and Virat play, there is a different belief in the crowd. As a coach, as a player, as a fan of Indian cricket, there presence is reassuring. They bring a different kind of passion into the game. Virat has been a gun player, with the number of runs he's scored. I think there's a lot of cricket left in both of them. I hope both of them win us the ODI series against South Africa,"" Raina said.","Former India cricketer Suresh Raina says he is looking forward to Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli returning.

Estevão’s solo brilliance lifts Chelsea to dominant win over 10-man Barcelona,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/top-stories/estevos-solo-brilliance-lifts-chelsea-to-dominant-win-over-10-man-barcelona/articleshow/125577093.cms,"Chelsea's Estevao, second right, celebrates with his teammates (Bradley Collyer/PA via AP)

A night marked by wholesale rotations, defensive mistakes and a moment of teenage brilliance saw both Manchester City and Barcelona fall to damaging Champions League defeats on Tuesday. While 18-year-old Estevão lit up Stamford Bridge with a stunning solo effort, lapses at the back hurt both European heavyweights.Pep Guardiola’s 100th Champions League match in charge of City turned sour as Bayer Leverkusen punished a heavily changed side with a 2-0 win. Guardiola rested almost his entire starting XI from the weekend loss to Newcastle, including Erling Haaland, but the reshuffle backfired. Alejandro Grimaldo put Leverkusen ahead in the 23rd minute with a precise low finish, before Patrik Schick doubled the lead with a well-placed header in the 54th.“It feels wonderful and we gave everything till the last second,” Schick told DAZN.Barcelona’s night was even more chaotic. Chelsea cruised to a 3-0 victory at Stamford Bridge, helped by Jules Koundé steering the ball into his own net after a defensive mix-up in the 27th minute. Things worsened when Ronald Araújo collected a second yellow just before half-time for a reckless challenge on Marc Cucurella.Chelsea took full advantage. Estevão shrugged off two defenders to score a superb solo goal in the 55th, and Liam Delap added a third from close range in the 73rd.Barcelona have now lost four of their last 10 matches across competitions, leaving coach Hansi Flick under mounting scrutiny.The results left the top end of the table unchanged. A City win would have pushed them higher, but Wednesday’s fixtures featuring Bayern Munich, Arsenal and Inter Milan will now shape the standings. Borussia Dortmund climbed to fourth, Chelsea moved into fifth, and both clubs sit level with City on 10 points. Barcelona slid to 15th, while Juventus rose to 21 points as their revival continued.There was better news for José Mourinho, who finally secured his first Champions League victory with Benfica. Samuel Dahl smashed in a sixth-minute volley and Leandro Barreiro sealed a 2-0 win at Ajax, who remain winless after five games and have managed just one victory in their last 10 overall.Elsewhere, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang struck twice in four minutes to lead Marseille to a 2-1 comeback win over Newcastle. Dortmund snapped a three-game winless stretch with a commanding 4-0 victory over 10-man Villarreal, powered by a brace from Serhou Guirassy.Juventus edged Bodo/Glimt 3-2 in the Arctic Circle, needing a stoppage-time finish from Jonathan David after the hosts equalised late. Substitute Kenan Yildiz was involved in all three goals.Union Saint-Gilloise edged Galatasaray 1-0 through Promise David, with the Turkish side missing injured top scorer Victor Osimhen and ending the match with 10 men after youngster Arda Ünyay was dismissed.Scott McTominay continued his scoring run by netting the opener in Napoli’s 2-0 win over Qarabag. Qarabag’s Kevin Medina was briefly knocked unconscious after being struck by another McTominay effort but was later replaced. Napoli supporters also marked the fifth anniversary of Diego Maradona’s passing.Finally, Athletic Bilbao’s goalless draw with Slavia Prague kept both teams outside the qualification spots with five matches played.","Pep Guardiola's 100th Champions League match in charge of City turned sour as Bayer Leverkusen punished a heavily changed side with a 2-0 win.

Right structure required to take Indian football forward: Ireland coach Heimir Hallgrimsson,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/top-stories/right-structure-required-to-take-indian-football-forward-ireland-coach-heimir-hallgrimsson/articleshow/125569892.cms,"Heimir Hallgrimsson

CHENNAI: Indian football is at an all-time low. The top-tier leagues are yet to kick off for the season, and the players have no option but to plead to the national federation, at a time when they must be putting on a show on the pitch.In a period when much ink has been spilt on the country’s football ecosystem, Republic of Ireland head coach Heimir Hallgrimsson stressed that a structure must be built to reap rewards in the future. Hallgrimsson, who recently guided Ireland to the World Cup playoffs, has a fair idea of Indian football, considering his association with Sports For Life (SFL), a platform for grassroots sports development.“Football is not a new sport in India, but there is not much experience that one can tap into. Obviously, a football culture is not there. So, people in charge may not have been in the game or played the game at an elite level. We, as coaches, can only teach what we know. That is a weakness which needs to be assessed,” Hallgrimsson, the global ambassador and football mentor for the SFL, told TOI during a virtual interaction.While there is a feeling of doom and gloom in Indian football, Hallgrimsson remarked that it is not impossible for the country to create a superstar if a structure is put in place.“In India, football is growing really fast, like everywhere else in the world. If it (work) is done properly, the next big one can come from India. If there is a good structure, it is kind of unlikely that there will be no big football players from India. I do not know when, but it will happen at some point of time. If we start early, we may have a big name in the game in 10 to 12 years,” added Hallgrimsson, a former Iceland and Jamaica coach.Talking about his work at the SFL, Hallgrimsson said: “I like the project. I have a really broad spectrum of coaching; I have done a lot of seminars for coaches in Iceland. So, I am trying to help the SFL and ensure that they do not take the wrong step like many have done.”",Heimir Hallgrimsson says Indian football needs a structure to reap rewards in the future.

FIFA Fever: Fans Go WILD As Scotland Qualifies For Dramatic World Cup Return After 28 Years

Lee Bowyer vs Kieron Dyer (Newcastle, 2005)

Ricardo Fuller vs Andy Griffin (Stoke City, 2008)

Everton midfielder Idrissa Gueye entered an unwanted chapter of Premier League history on Monday, becoming part of only the third incident in which a player has been sent off for an offence against his own teammate — with four players now shown red cards across these rare flashpoints. The bizarre moment unfolded during Everton’s 1–0 win over Manchester United at Old Trafford, overshadowing the result and sparking widespread debate across football circles.The flashpoint came in the 13th minute with the score at 0–0. Moments after Gueye lost possession inside his own box — leading to a Bruno Fernandes effort — the midfielder and defender Michael Keane got into a heated argument. As the two confronted each other face-to-face, Keane appeared to shove Gueye, prompting the Senegal international to retaliate with a left-handed slap to his teammate’s face.Referee Tony Harrington immediately issued a straight red card, a decision later confirmed by VAR, which deemed the action a “clear strike to the face.” Everton goalkeeper Jordan Pickford and teammate Iliman Ndiaye quickly stepped in to separate the players.Gueye’s dismissal puts him in rare company — only two other incidents in Premier League history have seen players sent off for striking their own teammate.In one of the Premier League’s most infamous meltdowns, Bowyer and Dyer fought each other during Newcastle’s 3–0 defeat to Aston Villa. Both players were sent off, with Dyer handed a three-match ban and Bowyer suspended for seven games.With Stoke leading West Ham 1–0, Fuller slapped captain Andy Griffin after blaming him for an equaliser. He was immediately dismissed, and the incident derailed Stoke’s momentum as West Ham went on to score a late winner.Gueye’s red card, though unprecedented in Everton’s modern history, now joins those notorious moments.",Everton midfielder Idrissa Gueye was sent off against Manchester United.

Everton secured a 1-0 victory against Manchester United at Old Trafford on Monday in a Premier League match marked by Everton's Idrissa Gueye receiving a red card for striking his teammate Michael Keane. Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall's 29th-minute goal proved decisive, as the 10-man Everton team successfully defended their lead despite United's dominant second-half performance.The match took an unexpected turn in the 13th minute when Gueye, frustrated with Keane's apparent failure to receive his pass inside the Everton penalty box, confronted his teammate. After Bruno Fernandes missed a shot, Keane shoved Gueye, who responded by slapping Keane's face, resulting in referee Tony Harrington showing a red card for violent conduct.""The referee's call of red card to Gueye for violent conduct was checked and confirmed by VAR — with the action deemed to be a clear strike to the face of Keane,"" the league announced on social media.Gueye became the first Premier League player to be sent off for fighting with a teammate since Stoke City's Ricardo Fuller clashed with Andy Griffin in 2008.""I think it was just a moment of madness,"" Dewsbury-Hall said. ""It was avoidable but Idrissa has apologized to us all at full-time and said his piece. We move on from it. The reaction from the lads after that is unbelievable. We could easily have crumbled and lost the game comfortably and if anything it made us grow as a team.""Gueye later apologized on Instagram: ""What happened does not reflect who I am or the values I stand for. Emotions can run high, but nothing justifies such behavior. I'll make sure it never happens again.""""They were the better team, with 11 players or 10,"" United coach Ruben Amorim admitted. ""I felt from the first minute that we were not there with the same intensity so they deserve the win. If they have 10, let's push the opponent to the final third. We need to be near on the transition. We needed to be focused. We need to do more.""Despite being down to 10 men, Everton took the lead through Dewsbury-Hall's impressive 18-meter strike. Manchester United dominated the remainder of the match with 25 shots on goal compared to Everton's three.""I will sleep well tonight,"" Dewsbury-Hall said. ""I am so thankful we got the three points.""The victory marked David Moyes' first win as a visiting coach at Old Trafford in the Premier League after 18 unsuccessful attempts.""I'm incredibly proud of the players and the fans,"" Moyes said. ""We got over the line with 10 men. We started the ball brilliantly well, got the sending off, the game changed. But we showed resilience. Manchester United are in pretty good form at the moment, so it was never going to be an easy game. Good goalkeeping when we needed it. The boys were brave.""The result ended United's unbeaten run, marking their first defeat since a 3-1 loss to Brentford almost two months ago.

Jordon Hudson reacts to cheerleaders who couldn’t explain Bill Belichick’s job

Some stories in college football are about the game. This one is about the buzz swirling around Bill Belichick, his role at UNC, and the intrigue orbiting Jordon Hudson. While Belichick, 73, now leads North Carolina football, the cheer community turned the spotlight toward Hudson after a curious misunderstanding sparked laughter across social media. The drama and humor unfolded in real time, revealing how sports culture now stretches far beyond the sidelines. In this case, it merged cheerleading circles, family tension, playful slang, heated arguments and courtroom energy.Hudson watched the mix-up unfold online, sparked by one viral fan reaction. “Omg i thought ppl were saying that that bill guy is an unc coach as in like an old coach but i just realized yall were talking about the college and not actually calling him unc-,” a cheerleading fan account wrote via X on Friday, November 21. The slang interpretation of “unc,” meaning uncle or an older male figure, became instant comedy for Hudson, who reshared a response saying, “This is by far the funniest tweet [of the year] on cheer [twitter]. ”Away from the humor, Jordon Hudson found herself at the center of a tense family dispute. According to a New York Post report, Belichick’s daughter-in-law, Jen Schmitt, confronted Hudson after UNC’s game against Stanford on November 8.Schmitt allegedly claimed Hudson “is control s***” and called her “bats*** crazy.” The confrontation reportedly escalated when Schmitt told Belichick, “You choose your family or you choose Hudson,” while also directing Hudson to “eat a burger” and criticizing her clothing choices. The two women had already appeared to avoid each other during the matchup, adding fuel to a growing emotional conflict.Hudson did not publicly react with anger. Instead, she kept her presence visible and upbeat, posting from Kenan Stadium on November 22, writing, “I’ve loved supporting @billbelichick at his adult all-male football league competitions this season… Until next year, Kenan! 💋” Her tone suggested resilience and a sense of ownership over her public narrative.That continued when Hudson signaled legal intentions toward journalist Pablo Torre after he claimed she was “no longer allowed in the football building, she is not allowed on the football field.” Hudson fired back with, “P.S. I’m suing you @pstorre 🫶🏻,” while showing proof of access. Torre replied, “Hi @Jordonbella… I look forward to hearing from you!”In the world of football prestige and cheerleading energy, Hudson seems determined to make sure her voice remains just as loud as the game-day crowds.Also Read: J.J.

Leanna Hunter birthday outfit goes viral



It’s Leanna Hunter’s 24th birthday, yet she rocked a custom Travis Hunter Jacksonville Jaguars fit on her big day, turning a personal celebration into a moment of team pride. Even while Travis is sidelined and recovering, Leanna found a way to merge fashion, family, and football. Her choice of outfit was more than bold style. It was a statement of loyalty to the Jaguars and devotion to her husband, who is currently battling back from injury.Travis unfortunately suffered a lateral collateral ligament tear in his knee in a non-contact practice incident on October 30. The injury required surgery and ended his rookie season, leaving him at home recovering with their baby son while Leanna takes on support, care, and motherhood. She even playfully teased him with a “two babies” post as she navigates both caring for their child and her recovering husband.This year, Travis wanted to make her birthday unforgettable once again, decorating their new Jacksonville mansion and bringing the same love he showed last year when he treated her to a luxury brand shopping spree. Leanna then shared her birthday look, posting three photos in black jeans and sleek high-heeled boots.The highlight was her sleeveless lace-up Jaguars inspired top. She captioned the post simply with “24,” followed by a heart and pink flower emojis. Her followers quickly flooded the comments with compliments and birthday messages. Even WNBA star Angel Reese stepped in with, “Happy birthday gorgeous.”This birthday is a milestone for Leanna as it is her first as a mother. The couple welcomed their baby in August and chose to keep both their pregnancy and their child’s name private. Their story goes back to Collins High School in Suwanee, Georgia, eventually marrying on May 24 in Tennessee with 250 guests celebrating their relationship.Leanna has been by Travis’s side through highs and controversy alike, including the time she drew attention for not standing during his Colorado Buffaloes Heisman celebration. Since then, their life has evolved at full speed. Marriage. A new home. A new city. A child. And a birthday celebration filled with style and symbolism.As the Jaguars sit 7-4 and prepare to face the Titans on November 30, Hunter’s absence forces roster shifts. Yet, through it all, Leanna’s birthday look made one thing clear. Their bond, their resilience and their pride in Jacksonville remain unshaken.Also Read: ""Get f***ed"": Kylie Kelce leaves no doubt about her opinion of Cowboys with savage remark ahead of Chiefs clash","Leanna Hunter wore a custom Travis Hunter Jacksonville Jaguars outfit for her 24th birthday.

Kylie Kelce is not shy about rooting against the Cowboys

Kylie Kelce is not shy when it comes to her Philadelphia Eagles fandom, and her emotions have been running high. Watching the Eagles take a 21-0 lead against the Dallas Cowboys, only to collapse in a 24-21 defeat, stung in a way only bitter division losses can. Yet her focus quickly shifted to a personal mission as the NFL’s Thanksgiving lineup delivers a game with family ties. Dallas will host the Kansas City Chiefs, giving Kylie’s brother-in-law, Travis Kelce , a primetime stage. She made her stance clear and asked her listeners to follow along.“Speaking of Thanksgiving football,” Kelce began. “Don’t root for the Cowboys and do root for the Chiefs. Let’s go, Uncle Trav… I’m so sick of the idea that the Cowboys are America’s Team. So, they can kiss my ass and, you guessed it, get f***ed.”Her frustration with Dallas runs deeper than just last Sunday. Kylie has watched the narrative of the Cowboys being “America’s Team” linger since the late 1970s, and she is tired of it. For her, this week is about family pride and a little bit of payback. Uncle Trav has faced Dallas three times, recording twelve receptions for 147 yards and a touchdown, along with a rare rushing touchdown.If he matches those numbers on Thursday, it could become a memorable night for Kansas City.His relationship with Taylor Swift has brought new attention to the Chiefs, but his on-field success is the bigger story. Kylie even celebrated his latest milestone, as he recently broke the Chiefs’ all-time touchdown record, previously held by Priest Holmes.This Thanksgiving matchup is also a rarity. The Cowboys and Chiefs have played only twelve times since 1970. Their most recent was in 2021, and the last time the Chiefs visited Dallas was in 2017. The NFL clearly recognized the weight of this year’s meeting. With the game airing on CBS and called by Jim Nantz, Tony Romo, and Tracy Wolfson, the viewership will be massive.Kylie Kelce hopes many will tune in and cheer against Dallas. For her, it is personal, passionate, and family-driven. The Chiefs will fight to stay in the AFC playoff hunt. The day after, the Eagles have their own crucial matchup against Chicago. It is shaping up to be a charged holiday stretch in the Kelce household, and Kylie has already planted her flag regarding who deserves the country’s support.Also Read: J.J.

Amid concussion protocol drama, J.J. McCarthy finds peace holding newborn son in touching family snapshot

Vikings quarterback J.J. McCarthy is now in the league’s concussion protocol after reporting postgame symptoms during the team’s flight home from Green Bay. Coach Kevin O’Connell confirmed the development Monday and said McCarthy will be closely monitored this week. With the Vikings preparing for a trip to Seattle, McCarthy’s status remains uncertain and his absence would leave the team in a difficult spot. The rookie quarterback was evaluated Sunday night at TCO Performance Center, following a 23-6 loss to the Packers that saw him sacked five times and struggle through another disappointing performance.O’Connell declined to specify the severity of McCarthy’s symptoms or determine whether he will be cleared to play. He made it clear that the organization will follow medical direction, saying, “I think it’s probably too early to tell that as far as the quarterback not really taking contact in practice and the different phases of the protocol, I think we just gotta take it a day at a time and leave it to the medical professionals and the protocol that’s in place for a reason. ” The coach also noted that neither McCarthy nor the team could pinpoint a specific hit, but believed it “had to be late.”If McCarthy isn’t cleared, undrafted free agent and former Minnesota Gopher Max Brosmer will handle first-team practice reps, though O’Connell said it is “too early” to confirm a starter. The timing is difficult, not only because McCarthy is already under pressure, but because his opponent would be the Seahawks featuring former Vikings QB Sam Darnold, who is enjoying a strong season.This marks the second time McCarthy will miss practice time due to injury. Earlier, he missed five games with a high ankle sprain, just a season after he was kept out entirely with a torn meniscus suffered in preseason. On the field, his numbers reflect the rough season. He is 2-4 as a starter with 929 yards, six touchdowns, and 10 interceptions. The promise he showed as a national champion at Michigan has not yet translated to consistent NFL success.Away from the pressure, his personal life offers a different story. McCarthy and fiancée Katya Kuropas welcomed their first child, a baby boy named Rome, in September. After Sunday’s loss and the wave of criticism, Kuropas shared a heartwarming photo of McCarthy holding his son. For a 22-year-old quarterback in a demanding spotlight, moments like that remind him what remains bigger than the scoreboard.Also Read: Nick Bosa caught in viral non-girlfriend drama after Megan Moroney’s surprising public swipe at him","Vikings quarterback J.J.

Megan Moroney’s random dig at Nick Bosa leaves 49ers fans stunned and demanding to know what really happened



Many fans were already halfway convinced that Megan Moroney and Nick Bosa were quietly turning into the NFL’s newest celebrity pairing. After all, when Moroney appeared at a San Francisco 49ers game wearing a personalized jersey, the speculation engine went into overdrive. Add to that the mutual Instagram follows, which today basically act as a neon sign of mutual interest, and it felt like a story already in motion. The internet saw a spark and ran with it. Then came the 49ers hat and that only stirred the pot even more.Right when the narrative looked like it would bloom into something real, Moroney chose a different tone with People magazine. The timing struck fans especially hard knowing that Bosa, the 28 year old reigning powerhouse of the 49ers, is sidelined with a torn ACL from Week 3 against the Cardinals. In the midst of this, Moroney delivered her statement with clarity.Her exact words were, “I'm not dating right now at all,” Moroney said. “I'm too busy.” That answer created a wave of curiosity. People magazine leaned into the connection to Bosa, but the real mystery is whether Moroney was addressing him directly. Was the question specific or general. Were follow up questions intentionally avoided. Those missing details leave room for interpretation.There is also the matter of timing. These two followed each other for a reason. They had some level of communication. Maybe a flirtation. Maybe more. Even now, they still follow one another on Instagram. This at least suggests no visible drama and no unfriendly split.Moroney’s touring schedule is not light or casual. She is in demand and booked heavily. Anyone trying to date seriously in the middle of that would find it difficult. Bosa, meanwhile, is in recovery and away from the field at a time when athletes need support more than attention. For many fans, that is exactly why the hope remains. The idea that once the stadium lights dim and the travel schedule settles, the door may not be fully closed.Until then, we take Moroney at her word. And we still admit we are invested. This is sports entertainment after all.Also Read: Kane Brown opens up about the 'traction' he got after clicking the viral photo featuring 'biggest couple' Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce",Megan Moroney appeared at a San Francisco 49ers game wearing a personalized jersey.

Is Hollywood star John Cena's wife Shay Shariatzadeh a huge NFL fan? Their shocking love story explained,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/is-hollywood-star-john-cenas-wife-shay-shariatzadeh-a-huge-nfl-fan-their-shocking-love-story-explained/articleshow/125563032.cms,"John Cena's relationship with Shay Shariatzadeh began with an unexpected ""love at first sight"" moment in Vancouver. Their bond developed privately, grounded in shared values and mutual respect rather than fame. Shariatzadeh, an engineering manager, brings independence and intellect, inspiring Cena and contributing to a mature, genuine connection that fans find captivating.

How their relationship developed beyond public image and into something deeper

John Cena’s relationship with Shay Shariatzadeh has fascinated fans because it feels strikingly real in a world full of staged celebrity romances. Long before marriage, headlines, or red carpet appearances, their story began with something almost cinematic, a moment of connection that Cena didn’t see coming. During filming in Vancouver, he noticed Shay at a restaurant and later admitted, “It was love at first sight.”That instant spark didn’t lead to rushed publicity or dramatic proclamations, instead, it grew quietly, privately, into something genuine. Fans have wondered whether Shay’s interests, including her rumored NFL enthusiasm, played a role in bonding with Cena. But their relationship seems grounded in shared values rather than shared fame.Shay Shariatzadeh didn’t step into Cena’s life as a fan or follower of his career, she stepped in as a successful engineering manager with her own ambitions, confidence, and grounded personality. Cena has called her “an inspiration,” a compliment that reveals how much he admires her independence and intellect.Rather than being drawn to the Hollywood spotlight, Shay approached the relationship with quiet dignity, rarely offering interviews or self-promotion.Their love story is especially compelling because Cena, once known for public relationships and a high-profile breakup with Nikki Bella, chose a different path this time; privacy, maturity, and emotional clarity. By the time they married in 2020, it felt less like a celebrity news splash and more like a personal milestone.As for the NFL curiosity, whether Shay is a hardcore football enthusiast or simply enjoys the sport socially, what matters more is how naturally she supports Cena’s world, while maintaining a full life outside of it. Their relationship seems to thrive on mutual respect, private laughter, and a shared belief that love is something nurtured away from constant scrutiny.In the end, fans are drawn to them because they look like a couple who truly chose each other, not for publicity, not for brand alignment, but for connection. Their romance stands as a reminder that sometimes the most captivating Hollywood love stories are the ones that begin quietly, with a glance across a room, and grow into something real.Also Read: Taylor Swift’s Disney+ docuseries faces unexpected legal threat from Florida courtroom as Travis Kelce remains silent","John Cena's relationship with Shay Shariatzadeh began with an unexpected ""love at first sight"" moment in Vancouver.

Will Jaxson Dart be able to return to face the New England Patriots?





The New York Giants are experiencing a challenging season without Jaxson Dart





Jaxson Dart, the 22 year old New York Giants’ star player, has a lot of responsibilities on his shoulders after Russell Wilson, the NFL veteran, was benched for him.But things came to a standstill for Jaxson Dart when he suffered a brutal concussion in Week 10 as the New York Giants lost against the Chicago Bears in Week 10. The New York Giants’ star player has already missed two games as fans panic about his presence in the upcoming game against the New England Patriots on 1st December.While Jaxson Dart is still recovering from his concussion, there is a high chance of the New York Giants’ star player returning to the field in the game against the New England Patriots on Monday night.A couple of days ago, the New York Giants’ interim head coach opened up about Jaxson Dart and said, ""Jaxson looked like his normal self…He looked great.""But that’s not all; in the last week, Jaxson Dart has also been spotted being a limited participant in practice sessions for three days.At this point in time, the New York Giants are following the concussion protocol of the league for Jaxson Dart.The 22 year old has gone through the fourth of the five stages of the standardized recovery process. It seems if Jaxson Dart is able to turn into a full participant in practice as the team gears up to face the New England Patriots, he would most probably be returning to the field on next Monday.However, as of now, neither the New York Giants nor Jaxson Dart has broken their silence on when he could return to the field.The New York Giants also recently lost Cam Skattebo to an ankle injury as he faced the Philadelphia Eagles.Without Cam Skattebo and Jaxson Dart, the New York Giants’ fans are concerned about the future of the team in the new season.The New York Giants have lost ten out of the twelve matches played so far and have consecutively lost in the last six matches.Also Read: OnlyFans model’s lawsuit claimed Shannon Sharpe reportedly “insisted” on filming their sexual acts","Jaxson Dart, the New York Giants’ star player, suffered a brutal concussion in Week 10.

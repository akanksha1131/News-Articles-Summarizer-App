Champions Trophy Squad: Chief selector Ajit Agarkar and skipper Rohit Sharma PC

KOLKATA: He came, met up with his old India teammates and then to the great relief of the team management, bowled full throttle.All eyes were on Mohammed Shami on Sunday, as the pacer returned to the national fold after more than a year following injury and prolonged rehab, with the India side getting down for the first practice session at the Eden Gardens ahead of the five-match T20I series opener against England starting Wednesday.With his troubled left knee still strapped heavily, Shami was the first bowler to pick up the white ball to loosen up. Bowling coach Morne Morkel marked the good length spot on the practice pitch as Shami bowled with a short run-up. However, even in those few deliveries, he got the ball to move around. It brought back memories.Over the course of a fine career, Shami has played some of his best cricket at the Eden Gardens. He will begin his comeback in India colours too from the same venue where it all began way back in Nov 2010, when as a 20-year-old boy from Amroha in UP, he made his first-class debut for Bengal against Assam. It went almost unnoticed, but the pacer picked up three wickets to be the highest wicket-taker for his side in that match.Three years later, an Eden Gardens packed to witness Sachin Tendulkar's penultimate Test match, also happened to see the rise of a future star of Indian cricket when Shami bagged nine wickets in his debut Test against West Indies. One legend was departing, another was taking form.At the age of 34 and with the wear and tear that his body had undergone over the years, it might not be wrong to assume that this homecoming would be the old warhorse's home stretch. On Sunday, after some fielding practice drills, Shami got into his bowling shoes to line up with fellow pacer Harshit Rana at the pacers' net. The duo bowled long spells to openers Abhishek Sharma and later Sanju Samson The need to get back a fit-again Shami has become paramount as questions remain over the availability of the recuperating Jasprit Bumrah for the Champions Trophy beginning next month. If Bumrah fails to get ready on time, India will need the experience of Shami to lead the attack. BCCI 's head of sports science Nitin Patel and National Cricket Academy (NCA) trainer Nishant Bordoloi have thus put the pacer in a strict dietary regime that includes more fruits and no place for his favourite biryani.It was learnt that Shami is unlikely to play all the five matches of the T20I series against England, but being more of a rhythm bowler, it is imperative for him to get into his stride before the Champions Trophy.Skipper Rohit Sharma on Saturday heaped praise on Shami, calling him the ""stalwart of white ball cricket"". The team will look up to him to deliver again, starting here at the Eden Gardens.",Mohammed Shami returned to the India fold after more than a year following injury and prolonged rehab. The 34-year-old bowled with a short run-up but got the ball to move around. Shami is unlikely to play all the five matches of the T20I series against England.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117383017,imgsize-28398,width-400,resizemode-4/117383017.jpg"

ILT20: Alex Hales, Jason Holder reflect on Desert Vipers' 53-run win over Abu Dhabi Knight Riders

ILT20: Erasmus, Dunk share thoughts after Gulf Giants beat Dubai Capitals for their first win

NEW DELHI: The Abu Dhabi Knight Riders secured their second win in the ILT20 Season 3, defeating Gulf Giants by 37 runs at Dubai International Stadium on Sunday.Despite Aayan Afzal Khan 's exceptional bowling performance of four wickets for 16 runs, setting a new UAE player record in DP World ILT20, the Knight Riders managed 176/9, led by Michael Pepper's half-century. Ibrar Ahmad, Jason Holder and Ali Khan claimed two wickets each to restrict the Giants.The Giants' batting struggled early as they lost both openers during the powerplay. David Willey dismissed Adam Lyth in the first over, whilst captain James Vince fell to Ibrar Ahmad for 14 runs in the fourth over.With 40/2 at powerplay's end, the Giants were lagging behind. The situation worsened when Jordan Cox departed for 10 runs and Ibrahim Zadran was bowled by Sunil Narine after scoring 24 runs from 22 deliveries.The Giants struggled at 62/4 at the halfway mark. Gerhard Erasmus and Shimron Hetmyer attempted to salvage the innings, but Hetmyer fell for 20 runs off 15 balls to Ali Khan. Jason Holder then removed Erasmus, who scored 24 runs from 23 balls, leaving them at 96/6 in 14.1 overs.The chase proved unsuccessful as Holder dismissed Mark Adair for 19 runs, with the Giants finishing at 139/8.Earlier, the Knight Riders' powerplay was eventful, reaching 60/2. Kyle Mayers and Andries Gous scored 19 and 17 runs respectively before Tymal Mills bowled Mayers and Wahidullah Zadran caught Gous behind.Michael Pepper, batting at four, started aggressively, hitting three consecutive boundaries off Mark Adair. He achieved a 31-ball fifty with six fours and a six, forming a 50-run partnership with Joe Clarke in 33 balls.The Knight Riders' momentum was halted by Aayan Afzal Khan's remarkable spell of 4/16, surpassing Zuhaib Zuhair's previous UAE record of 4/22. He dismissed Joe Clarke (24), Alishan Sharafu, Andrew Russell (12) and Sunil Narine, reducing Knight Riders to 131/6 in 15 overs.In the final overs, Pepper was caught behind off Adair for 57, while Evans, Holder and Willey made brief contributions. Blessing Muzarabani took two wickets as the Knight Riders posted 176/9.Player of the Match, Michael Pepper said: ""When I went in, when the ball was hard, it came on nicely. Not too much bounce in the wicket. Through the innings, it got slower and slower and started turning a little bit more. There is a lot of instinct that goes in, waiting for your areas and then going from there. We have a long batting order; everyone can hit it out of the ground, but it still must be the batters that score runs""Abu Dhabi Knight Riders captain, Sunil Narine said: ""We were always thinking two steps ahead and there were more hands on deck. We could have gone closer to 200 after our start. Losing wickets in clusters denied us and that is something we can work on moving ahead. Our batting depth, it is a good problem. You have players batting down the order who might be playing higher otherwise. The guys are willing, and it is about them trying to make the best of whatever position they get.""","Abu Dhabi Knight Riders beat Gulf Giants by 37 runs at Dubai International Stadium.

Masters standings: Praggnanandhaa (1.5), Gukesh (1.5), Caruana (1.5), Abdusattorov (1.5), Keymer (1.0), Wei (1.0), Fedoseev (1.0), Warmerdam (1.0), Sarana (1.0), Harikrishna (1.0), Van Foreest (0.5), Erigaisi (0.5), Giri (0.5), Mendonca (0).

NEW DELHI: Playing with the black pieces on Sunday in the second round of the Tata Steel Chess Tournament 2025 , D Gukesh conceded his first draw since becoming the world chess champion.Gukesh's opponent, Vladimir Fedoseev of Russia, began the day strongly at Wijk aan Zee, following his draw in the inaugural round on Saturday.Inside the playing hall, amid the chilly atmosphere, Gukesh finally donned the grey hoodie he had been carrying throughout many tournaments. However, there looms a question over its necessity as the heat on the board was enough to keep the grandmasters both engaged and warm.After a conservative start to the game, Gukesh moved his queen to capture Fedoseev's pawn on c5, giving the Russian an opportunity to exchange queens.Gukesh, without hesitation, traded Fedoseev's queen with Nxc5. With the queens off the board, Gukesh soon lost his rook on the 47th move but retaliated by capturing Fedoseev's knight with Kxe7. With both players left with four pawns and one rook each, they ultimately reached a stalemate. The players shook hands to agree on a draw, Gukesh's first in the 87th edition of the ""Wimbledon of Chess"".Overall, it was a day of draws, with India’s No. 1, Arjun Erigaisi , starting strong against Dutch No. 1 Anish Giri but ultimately settling for a stalemate. Both Arjun and Anish had begun their Tata Steel Masters campaigns on the back foot, suffering defeats in their respective tournament openers.While Arjun's defeat to Pentala Harikrishna was not as discouraging as Anish's heavy loss to Gukesh, Sunday's draw allowed both players to return to their camps—Anish, in particular, with a much happier face.After another long game, Pentala Harikrishna resigned against R Praggnanandhaa , giving the latter the tournament's first win and propelling him to the summit of the Challengers standings.Despite playing with the white pieces, Pentala was unable to withstand Praggnanandhaa's sharp and strategic play. With three pawns up, Praggnanandhaa left Pentala with no choice but to concede defeat.Not everyone in the Indian camp had reason to celebrate, as Leon Luke Mendonca, last year's Challengers winner, suffered another quick defeat. Facing the formidable Nodirbek Abdusattorov, Leon made a critical blunder on his 25th move with Qxd4.Capitalising on this error with precise knight and queen manoeuvres, Nodirbek secured Mendonca's downfall for the second consecutive day.Looking beyond the Indian contingent, World No. 2 Fabiano Caruana secured his first win of the tournament on Sunday, defeating the Netherlands' Jorden Van Foreest. Meanwhile, defending Masters champion Yi Wei settled for a draw against Alexey Sarana. The day's longest game, a 66-move marathon between Vincent Keymer and Max Warmerdam, also ended in a draw.ALSO SEE: Tata Steel Chess 2025 Schedule In the Challengers section, Divya Deshmukh, despite arriving late to the table, started the game on a strong note, putting Thai Dai Van under early pressure. However, the Czech chess grandmaster mounted a solid comeback, prompting Divya to settle for a draw, a fair outcome for the Indian player.Divya's compatriot, Rameshbabu Vaishali , who had secured an outstanding victory in the opening round, was forced to accept a draw against 14-year-old Miaoyi Lu of China.","D Gukesh concedes his first draw since becoming world chess champion.

NEW DELHI: The wait is finally over. India men's senior selection committee chaired by Ajit Agarkar will pick India's provisional squad for the upcoming Champions Trophy tomorrow (January 18) in Mumbai and they are set to face a happy headache while doing the same. While top-order is more or less clear, they need to find the right pieces for the middle-order puzzle. There are plenty of players in the mix for those 3-4 positions but Shreyas Iyer remains a no-brainer for the middle-overs period.With the right mix of caution and aggression, he has aced the 50-over game in the past and had a stellar 2023 ODI World Cup where he amassed 530 runs in 11 innings. The runs came at a healthy strike-rate and he hit two hundreds and three half-centuries during India's campaign. The right-hander had a turbulent little period where he lost out on an annual contract but bounced back in emphatic fashion during the IPL where he led KKR to the title.There were three ordinary outings against Sri Lanka in the ODIs but he rediscovered the touch during the domestic season where he made substantial contributions, across formats, for Mumbai. 452 runs in five First Class innings were followed by 345 runs in Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy and 325 runs in five List A fixtures. He has the weight of runs behind him but more importantly has the game suited for the surfaces in Dubai. With spin expected to play a major role in the tournament, Iyer has what it takes to control the middle period of the game like he did during the 2023 ODI World Cup.He has time and again reiterated that he is not fussy about batting positions and that flexibility will certainly come good. The England ODIs will definitely help coach Gautam Gambhir and captain Rohit Sharma to finalise composition of their middle-order, and it will make a lot of sense if it revolves around Iyer.Yes, there are plenty of right-handers in the middle-order mix at the moment but India do have some flexible left-handers in the lower-order who they can seamlessly move around as per the match situation. Those movements were on display during the three ODIs vs Sri Lanka and it could well continue in the upcoming ODI assignments.Axar Patel or Ravindra Jadeja? Or both?India picked both the left-arm spin all-rounders for the T20 World Cup but only Axar played the Sri Lanka ODIs as Jadeja was rested. The selectors now need to take that tough call because Axar did exceedingly well in the T20 World Cup and looked good in the ODIs vs Sri Lanka too. Jadeja, on the other hand, last played an ODI back in November 2023.It now remains to be seen whether the management moves on from Jadeja or carries both. It will be very difficult to ignore Axar because he lends a lot of balance to the Playing XI with his all-round abilities.All the questions will be answered in a few hours' time as the men who matter will get in a huddle to pick the squad for the multi-nation tournament.",India men's senior selection committee will pick provisional squad for Champions Trophy. Shreyas Iyer remains a no-brainer for the middle-overs period. Axar Patel or Ravindra Jadeja? Or both?

David Miller lauds Lhuan-dre Pretorius after Paarl Royals beat MI Cape Town

Dinesh Karthik on Lhuan-dre Pretorius, start for Paarl Royals in SA20

Jasprit Bumrah injury: Where things stand with BOOM!

Lhuan-dre Pretorius may be living life in the fast lane at the Paarl Royals in the SA20 , but the teenager’s dad Abe is still picking up traffic fines.Pretorius has burst on the global cricket scene in spectacular fashion with the former South Africa U-19 star smashing two half-centuries in three matches to top the SA20 run-scorers list.He has surprised many with the maturity he’s shown at the crease. Unfazed at the prospect of facing up to the likes of Trent Boult, Kagiso Rabada, Marco Jansen and Ottniel Baartman.But Abe Pretorius - Lhuan-dre’s father - claims his son is still just a normal teen finding his way in the world.“I remember when Anrich Nortje bowled to him. He told me an interesting story: ‘Dad, I wasn’t scared of the ball. I was more scared of me running into him because I saw it on TV.’ He was never afraid. Pace never bothered him,” said the senior Pretorius.“But he’s still a baby. He’s only 18. He has a mustache. But his beard is soft. He's still a kid and sometimes I forget.“But he's also not a kid getting all the speed fines. The car is still in my name. It's crazy!”The Pretorius family have certainly been there to support Lhuan-dre and fellow South African schools prodigy Vihan - ‘he’s my baby and can do no wrong’ - cricket aspirations since they first picked up a cricket bat.Abe installed a training net at their home in Potchefstroom early on and since they stayed close to Senwes Park - home of the North West Dragons - would regularly take his sons there to train.Lhuan-dre, therefore, had the privilege of spending time with the likes of SA20 stars Bjorn Fortuin and Rassie van der Dussen from a very young age.“He always wanted to play the game. He was brought up next to the field at Senwes Park. So, I was privileged to have a hospitality suite there. And that’s where he met Bjorn and Rassie.“He always played with them or next to the field to see them playing. And that's what's so nice. He plays now with Bjorn. There's a bit of banter going on between them.”At this critical age parents can often become over-indulged with their children’s sporting careers, forcing them to train when they may no longer enjoy it.Abe was never confronted with this issue.“He lives for cricket. He YouTubes cricket every night. I don’t think he’s watched a cartoon ever in his life. From a young age, before any big game, he would wake me up at five.“And we had a net in our yard at the back. So I needed to throw to him before school. And when he gets picked up and then he's ready in the afternoon.“I think more waking him up for academics. He never wanted to study. That was a headache and we had to get a tutor to assist him.”Whilst it was almost the perfect childhood growing up in Potchefstroom, the major cricket-playing high schools are based in Johannesburg. That’s close to 120 kilometres away.It is common practice for young South African boys to leave their family homes at 12-13 years old after being afforded scholarships to attend these ivy-league schools as hostel boarders.But Abe was having none of it. Instead, he packed up and relocated the entire family to “The Big Smoke” - as Johannesburg is colloquially referred to - for Lhuan-dre to attend the prestigious St Stithians College - alma mater of Kagiso Rabada, Grant Elliot and a certain Kwena Maphaka.The latter is, of course, the same age as Lhuan-dre with their cricket journeys following an almost identical path. They played together at school, youth provincial Lions teams, SA U19, and now at the Royals.And according to Abe, it's Lhuan-dre, who kept wicket for most of this period, that knows how to inspire the tearaway rookie fast bowler.“Lhuan-dre knew just how to switch Kwena on. He would always go up to Kwena and whisper something in his ear, and Kwena would get spitting mad,” he said.“After that, Kwena would run through the teams. There are a lot of video clips of when they were at school together, especially when Lhuan-dre was keeping. They were a mean team.”With Lhuan-dre being a left-handed opening batter that keeps wicket, has Gunn & Moore as his bat sponsor, and also having an aversion to a prospective academic career, the comparisons with Proteas and Durban's Super Giants star Quinton de Kock were inevitable.But according to Abe, Lhuan-dre would not want it any other way, and is looking forward to the Royals’ first clash against the Super Giants at Kingsmead on Thursday, January 23.“He’s had a photo up of Quinny since he was very young. He’s still Quinny’s biggest fan. He simply loved Quinny.“Everything about him is Quinny. Yeah, I think you're going to see when they're going to play each other. It's going to be a challenge. I think he's going to be a star-struck!""Everything is happening at the speed of light for Pretorius right now. If he maintains this early season momentum through SA20 Season 3, it would not be far too to suggest that the powerful left-hander could come into the reckoning as a potential replacement at the Indian Premier League (IPL) in the near future.So, how does a father keep a teenager in check when the whole world suddenly wants to give him everything his heart has always desired?“I'm Afrikaans! That's all. He knows me. I don’t play.“I'm a mining oak and I'm Afrikaans. So, he'll know his way.“That's a cultural thing. He knows how it works. You stay humble.”",Lhuan-dre Pretorius has scored two half-centuries in three matches for Paarl Royals in the SA20. The 18-year-old has surprised many with the maturity he’s shown at the crease. Abe Pretorius says his son is still just a normal teen finding his way in the world.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117332449,imgsize-38972,width-400,resizemode-4/117332449.jpg"

Numbers elicit praise from likes of Sachin

NAGPUR: Ironic as it may sound, the buzzword in Indian cricket over the past weeks has been a non-cricketing term - PR. Fan wars on social media, ignited by the debacle in Australia, sparked debates on 'paid news' versus authenticity.With the debate still raging, a post on X went viral on social media on Thursday evening. "" Karun Nair has a serious shot at making it to the Indian team if he can afford hiring a PR agency for a while,"" said the post.The witty remark struck a chord, highlighting the one element missing in Nair's arsenal - a robust social media presence. But in the Vijay Hazare Trophy , it wasn't PR that spoke for him; it was his bat, loud and clear.A total of 752 runs, at an unbelievable average of 752 was enough for Nair to trend on X. Social media has been abuzz, with many urging Indian selectors to draft Nair into the Indian squad for the forthcoming England ODI series and the Champions Trophy scheduled in Pakistan and Dubai.With an unstoppable 88* off just 44 balls on Thursday, Nair, who had been knocking on the selectors' door, almost broke it in the semifinal. Coming in to bat in the 35th over, the Vidarbha skipper unleashed his magic in the final 15 balls he played in the match, stacking up 55* runs. His ball-by-ball figures read 4, 0, 4, 0, 4, 6, 6, 1, 6, 4, 0, 6, 4, 4, 6. He hit boundaries for fun and toyed with the field at will.Cricket legend Sachin Tendulkar lauded Nair's run on Friday. ""Scoring 752 runs in 7 innings with 5 centuries is nothing short of extraordinary, @karun126. Performances like these don't just happen, they come from immense focus and hard work. Keep going strong and make every opportunity count,"" he posted on X.Former Indian spinner Harbhajan Singh too was vocal on his Youtube channel, questioning the double standards of selectors. ""Different rules for different people… that shouldn't be the way. When Nair is scoring runs, you need to play him, right? He doesn't have tattoos, doesn't wear fancy clothes, is that the reason you're not picking him? Does he not work hard,"" he said.Some also drew comparisons of Nair's purple patch with that of VVS Laxman before the stylish batsman was re-drafted in the Indian squad. ""When Laxman made a comeback into the Indian team, he made a big statement with 1,400-odd runs. Nair's stupendous show should be enough for him to launch his comeback,"" a post read.Nair's super show has rewritten history books too. He now tops the list of most runs as a captain in the Vijay Hazare trophy. He is also set to finish as batsman with highest average in Vijay Hazare history.Prior to being dismissed for 112 against Uttar Pradesh, Nair had set a new List A record of scoring 542 runs without being dismissed, going past former New Zealand allrounder James Franklin","Vidarbha batsman Karun Nair scores 752 runs at an average of 752 in Vijay Hazare Trophy.

To get off the plane in the morning and do that is special.

He expressed the team's desire to excel in this aspect of the game.""Fielding is an area of our game that we can work on. We try to collectively put in a big effort in the field. So, that's something we want to work on and fielding is something we want to be better at for sure,"" Duminy said.Avishka Fernando, who scored a blistering 81 off just 27 deliveries, with 8 sixes and 6 fours, credited his success to focusing on his natural game and maintaining a positive mindset while chasing a formidable target. Fernando's knock was the fastest-ever 50 in the history of the ILT20 .""Focussing on my natural game and thank the lord for today's knock. The wicket was nice to bat today, the thoughts when chasing 200 was to be positive, it came naturally and thankful for that. I did not realise that I have broken the record for the fastest-ever 50.""Coach Duminy showered praise on Fernando, commending his confidence and ability to perform despite having just joined the team. He emphasised the importance of creating an environment where players feel at ease, which is something the Sharjah Warriorz strive for.""Just the mindset that he came in with, he got off the plane last night and got introduced to the team after that. And to have the confidence to arrive and play the way he did, shows, not only his character but also his ability. And just for him to feel at ease in our environment is something we (Sharjah Warriorz) strive for, but that was certainly one of the most special knocks we have seen,"" the coach added.Duminy revealed that the team talk at the halfway stage was light-hearted, focusing on the quality of the pitch and the need to play to their abilities. He emphasised that intent would never be lacking in their lineup and that consistency was the key moving forward.Sharjah Warriorz will face the MI Emirates in their next match at Sharjah on Sunday.",Sharjah Warriorz beat Dubai Capitals by five wickets.

We're a better outfit than the last two games: Super Giants coach Lance Klusener

Keep improving and play some better cricket: Sunrisers' Liam Dawson

Durban's Super Giants faced another setback in the ongoing SA20 League , suffering a 58-run loss to defending champions Sunrisers Eastern Cape at Kingsmead on Friday. The defeat marked their second consecutive loss at home, leaving head coach Lance Klusener visibly disappointed with his team's performance.""We have a proud record from last season playing at home, so this is absolutely disappointing,"" Klusener said after the match. ""I think we're a better outfit than how we turned out in the last two games. While the surfaces have been challenging, that's no excuse. We lacked the aggression to take the first punch, and when you're on the back foot, it's tough to recover.""The Sunrisers, who entered the match on the back of three consecutive losses, delivered a resounding comeback. Klusener credited their sharpness and determination. ""They came in with three losses, so for them to bounce back the way they did was outstanding. They were running well between the wickets, and we all know how well they field. Sometimes it's the small things that make the big difference.""The Super Giants' batting woes continued to be a concern, with the team failing to capitalise on starts. ""It's not about the batting quality; we have outstanding batters. The problem lies in not building partnerships or capitalising on starts. This evening that surface was tough to make a comeback against some quality spin,"" Klusener explained.Noor Ahmad was the standout performer for Super Giants, taking 4 for 25. Klusener praised his former Afghanistan players, Ahmad and Naveen-ul-Haq , the latter finishing with 1 for 44. ""Noor has been an outstanding performer for a few years now. He bowls at a good pace, making it tough to pick him through the air. That's his strength. Naveen is quality too - most wickets in T20s last year. It's great to see them both step up.""Looking ahead, Klusener emphasised the need for self-reflection. ""We need to focus on ourselves rather than worrying too much about the opposition. The way we batted, especially without building partnerships, needs to change. While our bowling is in a better place, we need to score more runs to be competitive,"" he said.Meanwhile, Sunrisers Eastern Cape finally broke their losing streak in the SA20 season with the big win. The defending champions, who had struggled in their first three matches, delivered a performance that Liam Dawson described as crucial for their campaign.""It was a very important win. We know how good they are, especially at home,"" Dawson remarked in the post-match press conference. ""They've got two quality spinners in Noor Ahmed and Keshav Maharaj. So we knew it was going to be tough coming here and getting a win. As a group, we’ve been honest with ourselves—we haven’t played to our potential at all yet in this tournament. This was a massive game for us, and we’re very, very happy to get the win.""Dawson highlighted the team’s resolve to use this victory as a turning point. ""Without doubt, we’d love this to be the catalyst for more winning performances and points on the board. We know we’ve been below our standards in the first three or four games. We’ve got to come back Sunday and try to produce another good performance against a very strong side,"" he said.Acknowledging the competitive nature of the SA20 League, Dawson stressed the need for continuous improvement. ""Every team is strong in this competition. We won’t take this win for granted at all. There’s a lot we need to improve on as a group. The focus is on keeping the momentum and playing better cricket,"" he added.",Durban's Super Giants lost 58-run to Sunrisers Eastern Cape at Kingsmead. Defeat marks their second consecutive loss at home in the SA20 League. Head coach Lance Klusener was visibly disappointed with his team's performance.

What does the horoscope of struggling Prithvi Shaw say?

Former India cricketer Aakash Chopra has expressed surprise over the BCCI 's decision to enforce mandatory travel rules for players, requiring them to travel together with the team for matches and practice sessions. Speaking on his YouTube channel, Chopra questioned the necessity of such a regulation and suggested it might have been introduced due to prior misuse.""Players cannot travel separately with families. All players are expected to travel with the team to and from matches and practice sessions. I am extremely surprised by this rule. Going for practice or the match is with the team only,"" Chopra said. ""This has been happening forever. If someone wants to practice more, they request the coach. But has someone been leaving early? Some abuse must have happened; that's why this rule is being enforced,"" he added.The BCCI's decision follows a review meeting held after India's 1-3 loss to Australia in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy, attended by captain Rohit Sharma , head coach Gautam Gambhir , and chief selector Ajit Agarkar Referencing recent incidents, Chopra clarified that isolated lapses, like Yashasvi Jaiswal reportedly arriving late to a session, do not reflect a widespread issue. ""I am pretty sure everyone wouldn't have been flouting the rule. Yashasvi Jaiswal couldn't reach recently, and he got punished for being late. That's a different story,"" he explained.Chopra also highlighted the importance of accountability for those who might have allowed exceptions in the past. ""If someone claims they don't need to travel with the team because they're staying elsewhere or it's their city, then whoever permitted this should be called out,"" he asserted.The new rule requires players seeking to travel separately to obtain permission from both the head coach and the chairman of selectors. While acknowledging that such regulations might feel overly strict, Chopra remarked, ""Such things are bound to happen if rules are abused.""",Aakash Chopra has expressed surprise over the BCCI's decision to enforce mandatory travel rules for players.

Gavaskar recalls ‘love at first sight’ with Wankhede

MUMBAI: At a time when the fans are despondent thanks to India’s back-to-back series defeats home and away to New Zealand and Australia, India’s Test and ODI captain Rohit Sharma has offered hope amidst the gloom.Speaking at a glittering function hosted by the Mumbai Cricket Association (MCA) on Sunday evening at the Wankhede Stadium to celebrate 50 years of the iconic venue in Mumbai on Sunday, Rohit expressed his desire to bring the Champions Trophy back to the Wankhede Stadium, while referring to the celebrations at the stadium after India clinched the 2011 ODI World Cup and the T20 World Cups in 2007 and 2024.Sharing his aspirations for the global tournament, the 37-year-old said, “We will try our best... I’m sure that the wishes of 140 crore Indians will be behind us when we land in Dubai for the Champions Trophy. We will try to do well and bring the Champions Trophy 2025 to the Wankhede Stadium.”The 2025 Champions Trophy will begin from Feb 19 in Pakistan and UAE.On the occasion, the MCA felicitated all the surviving Mumbai players who went on to captain India-Sunil Gavaskar, Diana Eduilji (women's), Dilip Vengsarkar, Ravi Shastri Sachin Tendulkar , Rohit and Ajinkya Rahane.Recalling the celebrations at the Wankhede Stadium, which included an open-top bus parade at the Marine Drive here after India won the T20 World Cup in the West Indies & USA under his captaincy last year, Rohit said, “We were locked inside the hotel in Barbados (due to a hurricane). But winning the World Cup and celebrating it with your people is a different thing. You celebrate anyway with your players and teams but celebrating it with your people is a different feeling and I knew that will happen only once we are back in Mumbai.”Rohit revealed that he wanted the T20 World Cup trophy celebrations to take place only at the Wankhede Stadium. “I remember, we were still in Barbados after winning the (T20) World Cup and we were stuck there due to a storm but planning was in process as to what we will do once we are back in India. It was planned that we would go to (New) Delhi but what after that?“No one knew what to do after that, but I wanted that World Cup (trophy) should come here at Wankhede. Each of the World Cups which we have won in 2007 and 2011 have been celebrated at Wankhede and bringing it (the trophy) of 2024 was also very important for us. When we celebrated here (last year), the stands were full, (and) even today they are full, which is special about Wankhede,” he gushed.It’s clear that the enthusiastic Wankhede crowd, which makes for an electric atmosphere, has a special place in Rohit’s heart. “It was my dream to play cricket here at Wankhede since I was a kid. Irrespective of who plays here, India, Mumbai or Mumbai Indians, the crowd never disappoints and that’s why it’s a different feeling when you play here. When we returned from South Africa after winning the (T20) World Cup, I dreamt about winning another World Cup and bringing it here,” he said.Explaining why this stadium means so much to him, Rohit said, “Wankhede is one ground where every cricketer enjoys making dreams of playing here and seeing them come to reality. It is good to dream and to see them come to reality and I have watched and played cricket since my childhood because the atmosphere at this ground is very different. Every cricketer loves to come here and play cricket so that is the feeling you get at Wankhede.”Turning emotional as the MCA celebrated his 75th birthday on the special occasion, Gavaskar said, “When the Wankhede Stadium was built in 1974, our dressing room was downstairs. When we stepped into the ground for the first time for a practice session, it was love at first sight. Prior to that, we were playing at the Brabourne Stadium, which belonged to a club (Cricket Club of India). But coming here, it felt like the home ground of Mumbai cricket. The feeling is always different when you have a home ground. I still get that feeling whenever I come for commentary. My chest swells with pride.”Responding to his thoughts on the famous picture on being carried on his shoulders by his teammates after India triumphed in the 2011 World Cup, Tendulkar said, “It was without any doubt the best moment of my life. (Referring to Gavaskar), their 1983 victory inspired me that even I should have a trophy in my hand. We came close to winning the World Cup in 1996 in India and in South Africa in 2003. However, we crossed the final at the Wankhede Stadium at my home ground. Till that point, no host nation had won the World Cup.”The MCA also felicitated veteran cricket coach Vilas Godbole, who is the only living member of the 1972-73 managing committee, when the Wankhede Stadium was being built, and Shashi Prabhu, the architect of the cricket venue.",India captain Rohit Sharma has expressed his desire to bring the Champions Trophy back to the Wankhede Stadium.

His figures were the best by a West Indian bowler in Pakistan, surpassing Malcolm Marshall's 5 for 33 at Lahore in 1986.The Test match lasted fewer than eight sessions, despite a delayed start on the first day due to poor visibility. The Multan pitch offered sharp turn, which Pakistan's spinners exploited to great effect.Sajid dismissed key batters, including skipper Kraigg Brathwaite (12), Keacy Carty (6), Kavem Hodge (0), and Mikyle Louis (13). Noman trapped Justin Greaves leg before wicket for nine just before lunch, leaving West Indies in trouble at 54 ror 5.Earlier, Pakistan had resumed their second innings on 109 for 3 but could only add 48 runs.Warrican's impressive bowling earned him match figures of 10 for 101, his first 10-wicket haul in a Test match.The second Test match is scheduled to begin on January 25, also in Multan.",Pakistan beat West Indies by 127 runs on third day of first Test in Multan.

I am privileged to be part of the UAE team and just trying to give my best to that.""Parashar emphasised the importance of representing his country and balancing his league commitments. ""National duty always comes first. I always give a lot of priority and put my full efforts in it. After that, I look at the ILT20 and other leagues. That's international cricket; you are representing your country. That's very important,"" he added.Born in India and raised in Dubai since the age of three, Parashar’s journey reflects his diverse cricketing experiences. ""I started playing cricket in Dubai when I was eight. I played a year in the UK in age-group county cricket and half a season in a club in Mumbai. When I don’t have national duties, I go to India or overseas to train, like this time in the UK to play club cricket,"" he shared.He attributed much of his success to his parents' unwavering support.

They backed my dreams, and I am very grateful for that,"" he said.With an impressive start to his ILT20 career and his sights firmly set on the IPL, Parashar is determined to continue his hard work.

Darwin Nunez 's stoppage-time brace secured a crucial 2-0 victory for Liverpool at Brentford , extending their Premier League lead over Arsenal to six points.The Gunners, who were held to a 2-2 draw by Aston Villa after squandering a two-goal advantage, have seen their title challenge falter once more.Despite Liverpool's wastefulness in front of goal, Nunez came off the bench to make a significant impact, scoring his first Premier League goals since November.The Uruguayan striker finished off a neat one-two between Harvey Elliott and Trent Alexander-Arnold before smashing in a second goal, with Elliott providing the assist.""As a striker you get judged on goals, especially at a club like Liverpool,"" said the Reds' captain Virgil van Dijk. ""Today he put his mark on the game.""Liverpool also have a game in hand over the injury-hit Arsenal, whose title hopes took another blow at the Emirates Stadium.Gabriel Martinelli's effort crossed the line despite Emi Martinez's efforts, giving Arsenal a deserved first-half lead.Kai Havertz's shot also found the back of the net, despite Martinez getting a touch on it.However, Villa staged a comeback through Youri Tielemans' header, and the Belgian midfielder nearly leveled the score moments later when his shot hit the post.Ollie Watkins equalised for the visitors 22 minutes from time, cushioning in Matty Cash's cross off the underside of the crossbar.""Today we cannot concede the two goals we did after everything we did,"" said Arteta.

Griezmann blows penalty

Barcelona were held to a 1-1 draw by Getafe in La Liga on Saturday, failing to make up ground on the top two teams in the Spanish title race.Jules Kounde gave Barcelona an early lead, but Mauro Arambarri equalised for Getafe in the first half, and the Catalans were unable to break down Jose Bordalas' well-organised team.The draw leaves Barcelona in third place, five points behind league leaders Atletico Madrid, who suffered a 1-0 defeat at Leganes earlier in the day.Despite winning the Spanish Super Cup last week and thrashing Real Betis in the Copa del Rey, suggesting a return to form after a slump in late 2024, Barcelona dropped two points on the road in their first league match of 2025 against 16th-placed Getafe.""It's not done yet, we still have some matches to play and as I said before, we will fight until the end,"" Flick told reporters.""Today it's one point more, not two points less. We missed (out on) two points, but we have to look forwards and make it better next time.""Flick fielded his strongest side in recent weeks, hoping to secure a result at Getafe, where Barcelona had failed to score in their previous four away visits.The Blaugrana ended that streak in the ninth minute when Kounde, who also scored in the midweek Copa del Rey win against Real Betis, was cleverly set up by Pedri and scored on the rebound after David Soria saved his initial effort.However, Barcelona faced the same difficulties they have often encountered at the Coliseum, with Getafe digging in and denying top scorer Robert Lewandowski any space.Getafe equalized in the 34th minute when Coba's shot was parried by Barcelona goalkeeper Inaki Pena, and Arambarri pounced to score.The hosts maintained their tight defensive setup in the second half, making life difficult for Barcelona.Raphinha missed a golden opportunity to win the game for Barca in the closing minutes, hitting the side netting from close range after being found by Lamine Yamal's cross.""It was a shame, the match, we had control of the game and with one chance they scored one goal against us, it's a shame,"" Kounde told Movistar.After the match, Barcelona defender Alejandro Balde reported being subjected to racist abuse from some home supporters during the first half.On Sunday, Spanish and European champions Real Madrid, currently second in La Liga, host Las Palmas with the aim of moving to the top of the table.In another surprise result, league leaders Atletico Madrid suffered a shock defeat at Leganes, ending their club record run of 15 consecutive victories.Matija Nastasic headed Leganes in front early in the second half, and Antoine Griezmann missed a late penalty, dragging his effort wide, as Atletico fell to their second league defeat of the season.""I thought we were low on energy, it wasn't enough from us,"" Atletico goalkeeper Jan Oblak told DAZN.""We'll keep our head up after (winning) 15 games, we lost this one and we have to keep going forwards... unfortunately the streak is over.""Leganes, 15th in the table, defended well to keep Atletico at bay in the first half, with Julian Alvarez and Griezmann hitting the woodwork.Nastasic's header from a corner put Leganes ahead early in the second half, and they protected their lead without much trouble until controversially conceding a penalty for a debatable handball by Sergio Gonzalez.Griezmann took responsibility from the spot but rolled his 90th-minute effort wide of the goal.Atletico must now regroup in the Champions League, where they aim to reach the knockout rounds, as they face Bayer Leverkusen on Tuesday.""They were 15 extraordinary games, I feel enormously proud at having set the (consecutive) winning record in Atletico's history,"" Atletico coach Diego Simeone told DAZN.""We have to accept that defeat is part of the game and prepare ourselves for Tuesday.""","Barcelona held to a 1-1 draw by Getafe in La Liga on Saturday.

NEW DELHI: Darwin Nunez delivered a late heroics to fire Liverpool back into Premier League title contention with a dramatic stoppage-time brace, securing a hard-fought 2-0 victory over Brentford at the Gtech Community Stadium on Saturday.Liverpool entered the match desperate to end a run of two consecutive league draws, and Nunez, who had struggled for form with just four goals in 26 appearances this season, emerged as the unlikely hero. The Uruguayan's double lifted the Reds seven points clear of second-placed Arsenal, though the Gunners have an opportunity to close the gap with a win over Aston Villa later in the day.The result provided a massive boost to Arne Slot ’s side, who remain in control of their title destiny with a game in hand. It also marked Liverpool’s first league win in three games, after a series of disappointing results that included a draw against Nottingham Forest and a League Cup semi-final first-leg defeat to Tottenham.Brentford, boasting the joint-best home record in the Premier League, made life difficult for the visitors early on. The Bees nearly took the lead when Mikkel Damsgaard failed to convert Mads Roerslev's inviting ball across the six-yard box. Bryan Mbeumo also tested Alisson Becker with a fierce drive from the edge of the area.Liverpool, meanwhile, created a host of chances but were thwarted by Brentford’s resilient defense and in-form goalkeeper Mark Flekken. Dominik Szoboszlai came agonizingly close to breaking the deadlock, smashing a 25-yard strike against the crossbar, while Cody Gakpo and Luis Diaz both missed opportunities to find the net.In the second half, Brentford continued to threaten on the counter, with Alisson twice denying Mbeumo and Nathan Collins making a crucial goal-line clearance to keep Salah's deflected shot out.With time running out and frustration building, Slot turned to Nunez, bringing him on alongside Andrew Robertson. The move paid off spectacularly in stoppage time. Trent Alexander-Arnold delivered a pinpoint cross, and Nunez calmly slotted home from close range, sparking wild celebrations on the Liverpool bench.Moments later, Nunez struck again, this time latching onto Harvey Elliott’s perfectly weighted pass and rifling a fierce shot past Flekken to seal the win. The Uruguayan’s decisive contributions silenced his critics and ensured Liverpool stayed firmly in the title race.For Brentford, the defeat marked a missed opportunity to capitalize on Liverpool's recent struggles. Thomas Frank's men, who had shown resilience in their 2-2 draw with Manchester City earlier in the week, were left to rue missed chances and late lapses in concentration.Liverpool’s victory not only ended their mini-slump but also sent a statement to their title rivals. With Nunez rediscovering his scoring touch, the Reds are primed for a strong push in the second half of the season.",Darwin Nunez scores stoppage-time brace as Liverpool beat Brentford 2-0.

NEW DELHI: Justin Kluivert delivered a sensational performance with a hat-trick as Bournemouth ended Newcastle 's winning streak in emphatic fashion, securing a dominant 4-1 victory at St. James’ Park on Saturday.The result propelled Bournemouth into the Premier League 's top six while halting Newcastle’s bid for a club-record 10th consecutive win across all competitions.The Cherries, now unbeaten in 11 matches, stunned the Magpies with their relentless energy and clinical finishing. Kluivert, the son of former Newcastle striker Patrick Kluivert , stole the spotlight before Milos Kerkez added the finishing touch with a late fourth goal in stoppage time.Newcastle, still in fourth place, saw their cushion over Bournemouth in the race for a Champions League spot shrink to just one point. The defeat also ended Alexander Isak’s remarkable scoring streak, as the Swedish striker, who had scored in eight consecutive Premier League games, was effectively neutralized by Bournemouth's resolute defense.Andoni Iraola’s Bournemouth started brightly, dominating from the first whistle. They nearly went ahead in the opening minutes when Dango Ouattara’s shot was saved by Martin Dubravka, and Antoine Semenyo blasted the rebound over the bar. Just two minutes later, they found the breakthrough as Semenyo’s cut-back was clinically swept into the far corner by Kluivert.Though Newcastle managed to briefly equalize through Bruno Guimarães, who headed in Lewis Hall’s corner, Bournemouth restored their lead before halftime. Kluivert doubled his tally with a composed finish from Ouattara’s precise pass, leaving the hosts reeling.The second half saw Bournemouth continue to dominate, with chances falling their way. Ouattara had a goal disallowed following a VAR review, and David Brooks was denied by a combination of Dubravka and the post.Unlike their midweek disappointment against Chelsea, where they conceded a stoppage-time equalizer, Bournemouth ensured there would be no repeat this time.Kluivert completed his hat-trick with a stunning strike from outside the box, marking his second treble of the season—though this one was particularly special as all three goals came from open play, unlike his hat-trick of penalties against Wolves in November.Milos Kerkez then capped off the victory in style, drilling home Bournemouth’s fourth. The 19-year-old Hungarian left-back, rumored to be on the radar of Liverpool and Manchester United, added insult to injury for Newcastle with his impressive strike.The defeat marked a humbling afternoon for Eddie Howe’s men, who were thoroughly outplayed in front of their home crowd.

NEW DELHI: Manchester City star Erling Haaland on Friday signed a new contract with the Premier League champions that will keep him at the club until 2034.City announced the nine and a half year extension for the 24-year-old striker, who has netted an impressive 111 goals in 126 matches since his arrival from Borussia Dortmund in 2022.The extension marks the longest contract in the league's history, surpassing the nine-year agreement Cole Palmer signed with Chelsea last year. Haaland’s salary is reportedly set at £500,000 ($610,000) per week.Haaland, who joined City in 2022, made an immediate impact by scoring 52 goals across all competitions in his debut season. His stellar performances helped the club secure a historic treble, winning the Champions League, Premier League, and FA Cup. He continued his remarkable form last season, netting 38 goals and contributing to the team’s fourth consecutive league title.""I am really happy to have signed my new contract and to be able to look forward to spending even more time at this great club,"" said a joyous Haaland.""Manchester City is a special club, full of fantastic people with amazing supporters, and it's the type of environment that helps bring the best out of everybody.""I also want to thank Pep (Guardiola), his coaching staff, my team-mates and everyone at the club as they have all helped me so much in the past couple of years.

NEW DELHI: Amad Diallo's remarkable 12-minute hat-trick rescued Manchester United from a potentially embarrassing defeat against struggling Southampton at Old Trafford on Thursday.The visitors, who are battling to avoid finishing the season as the worst team in Premier League history, took a deserved lead through Manuel Ugarte's own goal late in the first half.Southampton had numerous opportunities to extend their advantage, with Ivan Juric's side playing with confidence and intensity. However, Diallo's introduction in the second half proved to be a game-changer for the hosts.The young forward equalised in the 82nd minute, capitalising on a defensive lapse to score his first goal. Eight minutes later, he latched onto a clever pass from Christian Eriksen to put United ahead.Deep into stoppage time, Diallo completed his hat-trick, taking advantage of another defensive mistake from the visitors.The 3-1 victory provided a much-needed boost for Manchester United, who had endured three consecutive Premier League defeats prior to this match.It also lifted them to 12th in the table, while Southampton remained 10 points adrift of safety.Despite the eventual scoreline, Southampton's performance was commendable, as they caused numerous problems for United's defence throughout the match.Kamaldeen Sulemana was particularly impressive, tormenting the home side's right-back with his pace and trickery.Ruben Amorim's decision to introduce Diallo and make other attacking substitutions proved to be a masterstroke, as the forward's clinical finishing ultimately secured all three points for Manchester United in a match that appeared to be slipping away from them.","Manchester United beat Southampton 3-1 at Old Trafford on Thursday.

""We never go down, we're always fighting... it was a tough game, but we got the goals and we won. We knew that in extra-time we had to run more, do more, get upfield, and we scored three very good goals.""Despite the victory, concerns regarding Madrid's defensive stability remain.The match also featured a disallowed goal for Madrid and a notable save by Madrid's goalkeeper, Andriy Lunin.""These goals are for Antonio (Rudiger), he knows what he does every day with me,"" added Endrick, thanking his team-mate for motivating him in training.

NEW DELHI: Brazilian football star Neymar jr recently shared his perspective on the dynamics within the Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) team during his time there.In a podcast hosted by Romário, a Brazilian World Cup winner, Neymar discussed the impact of Lionel Messi's arrival at the club in August 2021.According to Neymar, his former teammate Kylian Mbappé became ""a little jealous"" after Messi joined the team. Neymar suggested that Mbappé, who has since joined Real Madrid, didn't want to share the spotlight with anyone else, leading to some conflicts and a change in behaviour.“No, he is not. I have my things with him, we had a little fight, but he was fundamental for us when he arrived. I used to call him golden boy. I always played with him, said he was going to be one of the best. I always helped, talked to him, he came to my place, we had dinner together,” Neymar said.Neymar acknowledged that he had a good partnership with Mbappé initially, referring to him as the ""golden boy"" and praising his potential to become one of the best players.“We had some good years of partnership, but after Messi came he was a little jealous. He didn't want to split me with anyone. And then there were some fights, a change in behavior,” the Brazilian further added.While Neymar didn't explicitly name individuals, he mentioned that big egos within the team often hindered their performances in crucial matches.“It is good to have egos, but you have to know that you don't play alone. There needs to be another guy by your side. (Big) egos were almost everywhere, it can't work,” Neymar said. “If nobody runs and nobody helps, it is impossible to win anything.”Neymar also reflected on the possibility of returning to Brazil after his contract with Al-Hilal in Saudi Arabia expires later this year.It's worth noting that neither Mbappé nor Messi has responded to Neymar's comments as of now.","Neymar discussed the impact of Lionel Messi's arrival at Paris Saint-Germain.

Barcelona advanced to the quarter-finals of the Copa del Rey with a resounding 5-1 victory over Real Betis on Wednesday. The star of the show was 17-year-old Lamine Yamal , who put on a dazzling display at the Olympic Stadium.Gavi opened the scoring for Barcelona early in the match, and the Catalans continued to dominate with goals from Jules Kounde, Raphinha, Ferran Torres, and Yamal himself. The young winger's performance was particularly impressive, as he scored and helped create two more goals.Barcelona's confidence was high coming into the match, having recently won the Spanish Super Cup in Saudi Arabia by thrashing Real Madrid. Despite resting key players like Robert Lewandowski, the team's attacking prowess was on full display.Pau Cubarsi, a 17-year-old defender who came through Barcelona's youth academy alongside Yamal, praised his teammate's performance.""I've been enjoying watching him for many years, now the whole world is, and he deserves it all.""Barcelona's dominance was evident from the start, with Dani Olmo, who recently obtained a temporary playing license, starting as a false nine in place of Lewandowski. Olmo was involved in the opening goal and had several chances of his own, hitting the post and firing over.Kounde scored Barcelona's second goal after a sublime pass from Yamal, exploiting the right side of Betis' defense. Although Kounde had a second goal disallowed for a marginal offside, Barcelona continued to create chances.In the second half, Yamal had a goal of his own disallowed for an offside in the build-up, but it didn't matter as Raphinha scored minutes later after another surging run from the young winger. Ferran Torres added a fourth goal, and Yamal finally got on the scoresheet himself with a near-post finish.Betis managed to pull one back from the penalty spot through Vitor Roque, who is on loan from Barcelona, after Kounde fouled Jesus Rodriguez in the area.After the game, Gavi praised Yamal as the best player in the world after Lionel Messi, and coach Hansi Flick also commended the winger's talent.""Gavi's very emotional, so I say also yes (he's the best),"" joked Flick.""You can see it, in great matches you see big talent and he showed it many many times, he's on a good (path).""Yamal, who shone for Spain during their Euro 2024 victory last summer, has an impressive tally of nine goals and 13 assists across all competitions for Barcelona this season.In other Copa del Rey action, Atletico Madrid joined Barcelona in the last eight with a comfortable 4-0 win over second division Elche. This marked Atletico's 15th consecutive victory across all competitions.Atletico coach Diego Simeone rested some of his regular starters, but the team still managed to secure a commanding win. Alexander Sorloth scored twice in the first half, and Elche's chances of a comeback were further diminished when Nico Fernandez was sent off early in the second half.Rodrigo Riquelme and Julian Alvarez added to Atletico's lead, sealing an emphatic victory for the Rojiblancos.The Copa del Rey action continues on Thursday, with defending league champions Real Madrid hosting Celta Vigo and cup holders Athletic Bilbao welcoming Osasuna.","Barcelona defeated Real Betis 5-1 in the Copa del Rey on Wednesday.

London: Arsenal reignited their Premier League title challenge with a 2-1 victory over Tottenham on Wednesday, while Newcastle secured a spot in the top four thanks to a brace from Alexander Isak.In other matches, David Moyes had a disappointing return to the Everton dugout as his team lost 1-0 to Aston Villa at Goodison Park.The win at the Emirates lifts Arsenal to within four points of league leaders Liverpool, who drew 1-1 with Nottingham Forest on Tuesday, and ended a three-match winless run for the Gunners across all competitions.Tottenham took the lead through Son Heung-min in the 25th minute, but Arsenal equalised 15 minutes later when Gabriel's header from a corner deflected off Dominic Solanke for an own goal.Arsenal completed the turnaround just before halftime, with Leandro Trossard blasting a shot past new Spurs goalkeeper Antonin Kinsky.Despite numerous chances to extend their lead, Arsenal failed to do so and had a nervous moment when Pedro Porro hit the post in stoppage time.Arsenal now sits on 43 points after 21 matches, four points behind Liverpool, who have a game in hand.Mikel Arteta, the Arsenal manager, praised his team's performance, calling it ""outstanding.""""We had some big chances and big situations. At the end we had to suffer more than we wanted,"" he told the BBC.""When you have opportunities (to close the gap) you have to take them. We are on a really consistent run in the Premier League. It's about recovery tomorrow and Aston Villa on Saturday, going and going.""The defeat is another setback for injury-plagued Tottenham, who have taken only five points from their last nine Premier League games and have fallen to 13th in the table.Tottenham manager Ange Postecoglou was critical of his team's performance, saying, ""Nowhere near good enough, especially in the first half. We were too passive.""Newcastle moved into fourth place, ahead of struggling Chelsea, with a 3-0 victory over Wolves, thanks to a record-chasing performance from Isak, who scored for the eighth consecutive league match.Isak's deflected shot off Wolves defender Rayan Ait-Nouri put Newcastle ahead in the 34th minute, and he doubled the lead before the hour mark with his 15th league goal of the season.Anthony Gordon added a third goal for Newcastle.""I feel amazing,"" said Isak, who has Jamie Vardy's record of scoring in 11 straight Premier League games in his sights.""Individually I feel free and confident but looking at the team we are doing so well as well, defending and with threats going forward. It is a team and I have to keep contributing with goals.""At Goodison Park, Ollie Watkins scored the only goal for Aston Villa in the 51st minute, slotting past England teammate Jordan Pickford after being sent through by Morgan Rogers.Despite their efforts, Everton lacked creativity, which is unsurprising for a team that has scored only 15 league goals in 20 matches this season.The result lifts Aston Villa to seventh in the table, while Everton remain in deep trouble, just one point above the relegation zone in 16th place.Everton, who have been in the top flight since 1954, have struggled against relegation for the past three seasons and are once again in a perilous position.David Moyes, who enjoyed success during his 11-year stint at Goodison Park from 2002 to 2013, was brought back by Everton's new American owners, the Friedkin Group, after they sacked Sean Dyche last week.""Obviously it's been a bit of a whirlwind,"" Moyes said. ""Sean Dyche left a group of players that have great character and a great attitude.""I'm really pleased to take over that. What I need to do is add quality and find a way of getting results but you can't change the whole thing around straight away.""In another match, Leicester suffered their sixth consecutive league defeat, losing 2-0 to Crystal Palace, which leaves them second from bottom in the table.Jean-Philippe Mateta scored for Palace early in the second half, and Marc Guehi secured the points with a late second goal.","Arsenal beat Tottenham Hotspur 2-1 to move within four points of Premier League leaders Liverpool. Newcastle move into fourth place, ahead of struggling Chelsea, with a 3-0 victory over Wolves.

NEW DELHI: 24-time Grand Slam champion Novak Djokovic on Sunday refused to participate in the customary post-match TV interview at the Australian Open following his win over Jiri Lehecka in straight sets.The 37-year-old's interview snub came in protest of the comments made on air by Tony Jones, who works for Channel 9 , the official broadcaster of the tournament in the host country.During an on-air appearance at Melbourne Park, where a crowd of Djokovic's supporters were chanting, Jones referred to the Serbian player as overrated and a has-been.Although Djokovic did not name Jones directly, he expressed his dissatisfaction with the comments.""A famous sports journalist who works for official broadcaster, Channel 9 ... made a mockery of Serbian fans and also made insulting and offensive comments toward me,” Djokovic said, mentioning that he will continue to avoid speaking to the network.“I leave it to Channel 9 to handle this the way they think they see fit. That’s all,” Djokovic said.After defeating Jiri Lehecka in three sets at Rod Laver Arena and advancing to the quarterfinals, Djokovic was expected to speak with former player Jim Courier on television. Instead, he addressed the crowd directly, expressing his gratitude for their presence and support, promising to see them in the next round.Later, during his news conference, Djokovic clarified that his decision not to do the interview was due to his displeasure with Jones and the broadcaster, not Courier or the fans in the stadium.He also mentioned that he had spoken to Craig Tiley, the CEO of Tennis Australia, about the issue.“I just wanted to make sure that he knows where I stand and the reasons behind it,” Djokovic said. “So I told him: ‘If you guys want to fine me for not giving an on-court interview, that’s OK.’ I’ll accept that ’cause I feel like this is something that needs to be done. That’s all there is to it.”","Novak Djokovic refused to participate in the customary post-match TV interview at the Australian Open.

NEW DELHI: 10-time champion Novak Djokovic on Sunday set up a blockbuster Australian Open quarter-final against Carlos Alcaraz after beating Czech Jiri Lehecka .The Serbian, 37, who is aiming for a record 25th Grand Slam title, triumphed over the 24th seed Lehecka 6-3, 6-4, 7-6 (7/4) at the Rod Laver Arena.The victory marks Djokovic's 15th quarter-final appearance at Melbourne Park, a record he now shares with Roger Federer and is one ahead of Rafael Nadal and John Newcombe.The win also extends his own all-time mark to 61 for the most quarter-final appearances at major tournaments, three ahead of the Swiss great.Djokovic's reward is a showdown on Tuesday with third seed Alcaraz, who, at the age of 21, is already a four-time Slam winner but has never advanced beyond the Australian Open quarters. The Spaniard secured the clash after Briton Jack Draper retired during their last-16 match while trailing 7-5, 6-1.""Being in a quarter-final, I'm going to approach the match the same as I did in the previous matches against him, and let's see,"" said Alcaraz of Djokovic.""When we are seeing him playing, he seems like he's young again, so... It's unbelievable. He's in a really good shape.""But the Spaniard added: ""I'm just ready and I know what I have to do in quarter-finals.""Djokovic and Alcaraz have faced each other seven times, with the Serb holding a 4-3 lead, including a victory in their most recent encounter in the Paris Olympics final.They have met at Grand Slams three times, twice in the Wimbledon decider, with the Spaniard winning on both occasions. However, they have never played at Melbourne Park, where Djokovic has achieved his greatest success.Lehecka, who won the lead-up Brisbane International event where Djokovic lost in the quarter-finals, was never seriously in contention on the big stage.Djokovic quickly put pressure on his serve and achieved a break in the eighth game of the first set when the Czech double-faulted.Another break on Lehecka's opening serve set the tone for the second set, with Djokovic dominating from the baseline.In a closer third set, the young Czech changed tactics, pushing Djokovic to the net more while increasing his serving intensity. The set went to a tiebreak, where the Serb produced some stunning shots to seal the win.In his match against Draper, Alcaraz was well in control when the Briton retired on a sweltering afternoon due to 'multiple areas really in pain'.The 15th seed Draper needed five sets to win his first three Melbourne matches, rallying from behind in all of them to stay in the tournament, and it finally caught up with him.""It's not the way I wanted to win. But obviously I'm happy to play another quarter-final here in Australia,"" said Alcaraz.""Physically, I'm feeling great. So coming into the second week of a Grand Slam it is important to feel well physically because right now the matches are even tougher.""","Novak Djokovic beats Czech Jiri Lehecka to reach Australian Open quarter-finals.

'Was playing a bit too passive': Coco Gauff drops a set but reaches Australian Open quarters,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/top-stories/was-playing-a-bit-too-passive-coco-gauff-drops-a-set-but-reaches-australian-open-quarters/articleshow/117372387.cms,"Coco Gauff (AP photo)

Belinda Benic , 27, a new mother, with flat ground strokes and an aggressive counterpunching style of play, was the mirror Coco Gauff needed to look into in her Australian Open fourth-round clash.The 20-year-old, ranked three in the world, dropped her first set of the season to the 2021 Olympic gold medallist Bencic. The American, playing in a light green bodysuit with cut-outs on the back, that also included a tennis skirt in a cargo green shade, stepped up the pace in time to execute a 5-7, 6-2, 6-1 win in a two-hour and 26-minute comeback to improve her 2025 win-loss record to 9-0.Matt Daly, a former collegiate tennis player, with a degree in finance, was expressly roped into the Gauff coaching team last September. The 46-year-old Daly, who played on the pro tour briefly, urged the world No.3 to accelerate at the end of the 62-minute opening set.“I just got one (suggestion), which was to be more aggressive,” Gauff said of the message coming from her coaching box. “She (Belinda) was playing great tennis, I was playing a lot of defence, my balls were landing short. Obviously when I lost that set, I knew I was playing a bit too passive at moments, (especially) when you're playing someone who is standing on top of the baseline and ripping. I almost just kind of had to play like her.”“I started going for my shots more and being okay with maybe making more unforced errors and hopefully seeing the reward later on,” she said.It helped that Bencic, whose daughter Bella is eight months, had lost her legs by the end of the first set.Gauff, whose serve is still work in progress, leads the women’s draw for double faults at 29, she had nine from her latest outing and her aces tally also tops the leaderboard at 28 so far in the tournament.The Rod Laver Arena was firmly behind the 20-year-old and showed little appreciation for Bencic, who had given everything she had in the first set and just about held on in the second and by the time the decider came around she was literally doubling over but refused to stop.The near full house started with ‘Let’s go Coco, let’s go’, and then switched to, ‘Here we go Coco, here we go’, after the American took charge of the match in the second set. Bencic wasn’t amused, but she’ll have to wait for an adequate response.“In the heat, the court plays faster. As far as court speed (goes), it was probably more of an advantage for her because I think she likes to play faster on faster courts,” Gauff said. “I guess weather-wise, I felt pretty confident in my physicality. Against anyone, I feel pretty confident in my physical fitness. Also being from Florida, September and August, is really disgusting (heat wise).”In the last eight-clash on Tuesday, Gauff will be up against Spain’s 11th seed Paula Badosa, who knocked Serb Olga Danilovic 6-1, 7-6 (2) in her fourth-round clash. The Spaniard, who made the US Open quarterfinals last September, made the last eight for the first time at Melbourne Park. The left-handed Danilovic, 23, is the daughter of basketball legend Predrag Danilovic.Gauff and Badosa are locked 3-3 in head to head clashes, with the 20-year-old winning their most recent outing on hardcourts in the semi-finals in Beijing last September.Gauff was asked what made Badosa so tough to put away. “Her physicality,” she said. “She can obviously serve well, hit on both wings of the court. I think it’s her physicality. She's a great mover and can play aggressive, she's an all-around player, complete.”","Coco Gauff beat Belinda Bencic 5-7 6-2, 6-1 in her Australian Open fourth-round clash.

NEW DELHI: Alexander Zverev secured a spot in the Australian Open quarter-finals on Sunday, overcoming a mid-match wobble to defeat France's Ugo Humbert.The second seed Zverev, focused on winning his first Grand Slam title, next faces American 12th seed Tommy Paul , who easily defeated Spain's Alejandro Davidovich Fokina in straight sets.Zverev started and finished strongly on John Cain Arena, beating the 14th seed 6-1, 2-6, 6-3, 6-2 despite a brief lapse in concentration.""He's an incredible top player and has improved tremendously and I'm happy to be in the quarter-finals,"" said Zverev, a two-time Grand Slam finalist.""Extremely happy to be in the quarters only losing one set. I definitely want to play three more matches here.""The 27-year-old has been in impressive form, continuing his stellar 2024 season that propelled him to a career-high ranking of world No. 2.This is his second consecutive quarter-final appearance for Zverev in Melbourne, having reached the semi-finals last year before losing to Daniil Medvedev.Despite reaching Grand Slam quarter-finals 14 times, Zverev has never been able to win a title after a decade of trying. If he succeeds, he would be the first German man to win a Slam since Boris Becker in Melbourne in 1996.Zverev remained calm and composed against Humbert, who has yet to reach a Grand Slam quarter-final in 25 attempts, even after losing the second set. He refocused and reasserted control, winning 100 percent of his first serve points in the third set and never looked back.Paul is expected to be a tougher opponent for Zverev. The Australian Open has been Paul's most successful Grand Slam throughout his career, with a 15-5 win-loss record in his six tournaments.Paul's best Slam result came in Melbourne when he reached the semi-finals in 2023, becoming the first American man to do so since Andy Roddick in 2009. He defeated Davidovich Fokina along the way that year before being eliminated by Novak Djokovic ""I'm always happy to be back in Australia and to be in the quarter-finals again. It's amazing,"" said Paul after the 6-1, 6-1, 6-1 demolition job.""This court is where I came through to my first quarter-final ever, and now my second one here in Australia on this court.""So great memories on this court,"" added the 27-year-old, who dominated on serve against the Spaniard while crunching 25 winners.",Alexander Zverev beats France's Ugo Humbert to reach Australian Open quarter- finals.

Carlos Alcaraz progressed to the Australian Open quarter-finals after his opponent, Jack Draper , retired during their last-16 match on Sunday at Rod Laver Arena amidst scorching conditions. At the time of Draper's withdrawal, the Spanish third seed was leading the match with a score of 7-5, 6-1.Draper, seeded 15th, had previously endured three grueling five-set victories in his earlier matches, staging comebacks in each one. The nearly 13 hours he spent on court, compared to Alcaraz's six, proved to be too demanding in the end.""It's not the way I wanted to win. But obviously I'm happy to play another quarter-final here in Australia,"" Alcaraz stated, expressing sympathy for Draper's injury.The British player had previously withdrawn from the United Cup due to hip issues. This marks Alcaraz's second consecutive quarter-final appearance at Melbourne Park, with his previous attempt in January 2024 ending in a loss to Alexander Zverev.He now awaits the winner of the match between Novak Djokovic and Czech Jiri Lehecka .

Coco Gauff , the world number three, continued her impressive run at the Australian Open on Sunday, despite losing a set for the first time this season. She battled through the heat in Melbourne, with temperatures reaching 34 degrees Celsius, to overcome Switzerland's Belinda Bencic 5-7, 6-2, 6-1.The win sets up a quarter-final clash against Spain's Paula Badosa , who earlier defeated Serbia's Olga Danilovic 6-1, 7-6 (7/2).""I thought, first set, she played great tennis and it was tough for me to be on the offensive,"" said Gauff, who extended her unbeaten streak to 13 matches going back to last year's WTA Tour Finals. ""I just played more aggressively in the second set and then also the third set. But overall, I'm happy with how I played.""The match was evenly contested in the early stages, but Bencic's variety of shots seemed to unsettle the American. Gauff, who had not dropped a set in eight matches this season, faced pressure from Bencic, who converted a second break point in the ninth game.This stirred a response from the American, who immediately broke back to level the score at 5-5 with a sizzling backhand pass down the line. However, Gauff double-faulted twice, handing Bencic the decisive break and the opening set after 62 minutes.Gauff struggled with her serve throughout the match, committing nine double faults in total. Despite this, she managed to turn things around in the second set, forcing a decider.Bencic, the Tokyo Olympics gold medallist, entered the match with a 2-1 win-loss record over Gauff, but their last meeting was in 2023. Shortly after that, Bencic took maternity leave to give birth to her daughter Bella and only returned to tennis at the end of 2024.Gauff's hard-fought hold after three deuces at the start of the third set set the tone for the remainder of the match, as Bencic began to feel the effects of the heat. The American wore down her opponent and broke for a 3-1 lead before closing out the match in 2 hours and 26 minutes.Badosa's victory marks her first quarter-final appearance at the Australian Open. She is the first Spanish woman to reach the last-eight at Melbourne Park since Garbine Muguruza achieved the feat in 2020.","Coco Gauff defeated Switzerland's Belinda Bencic 5-7, 6-2,6-1 at the Australian Open.

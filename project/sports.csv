NEW DELHI: Karun Nair is back in top-flight cricket with Delhi Capitals this IPL season. It’s been five years since he last played an IPL game. Incidentally, when his career hit its peak with a Test triple century in 2016, he was a part of the Delhi franchise.“Only thing that has changed since then is that I am a lot older now, besides it’s no more Delhi Daredevils now,” Nair said with a modest smile.At 33, Nair has become a hot topic in Indian cricket with nine centuries this domestic season. He has managed to resurface after being dropped by his home state Karnataka a few years ago -- there’s something cold about the smile on his face now.Nair’s career started unravelling three Tests after he became the only the second Indian to score a triple century. From being one of the hottest properties in Indian cricket, he was consigned to the cold storage in six months. He was out of sight and almost out of mind till the 2024-25 domestic season happened with Vidarbha. And now, he may well be pushing his case to make a comeback in India’s rather fragile Test middle order if he is picked for the India ‘A’ tour ahead of the England Test series.“I have been playing cricket for a while, I have seen ups and downs and it’s all about how you come back from the downs and treat the ups. I have learnt how to react to those situations,” Nair said on Sunday. “Obviously it has been tough times. It is something that helped bring myself to this stage, push me for more motivation and have hunger all the time.”When most players fall by the wayside, he managed to find the motivation to go through the entire process all over again — performing in domestic cricket, earning an IPL spot and pushing for an India ‘A’ selection before getting back in national reckoning. But he doesn’t want to believe that he has reattained his peak yet.“I think I am closer but don’t know how close. That’s not my focus but it’s at the back of the mind,” he said.Nair saw dizzy heights and hit rock bottom in no time. Does that make him careful about the highs now?“No. You should be able to enjoy the highs. That’s what you work for,” was Nair’s curt reply. But it’s been a long time since he played such high intensity cricket. He is aware that it will take some more work to get used to this environment.“I will find my process and rhythm as soon as I can. I’ll like to start well early and try to get better as the tournament goes on. The only thing that I have done is play according to the situation, added a few shots and built the confidence to execute them when needed. I also now try to stay relaxed,” he claimed.He may have gone through the journey all over again, but this is not unfamiliar territory. That he will have his long-time mate KL Rahul by his side at Capitals will ease the process for him.“It is exciting to be back with KL. We have played together since our childhood. He has done well in the IPL and had a great Champions Trophy. I am happy to be back with him,” Nair said.",Karun Nair is back in top-flight cricket with Delhi Capitals this IPL season.

Will Rohit Sharma win 2027 World Cup? Astrologer Lobo predicts after getting Champions Trophy bang on!

New Zealand spinner Ajaz Patel has thrown his weight behind Indian cricket legends Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli , stating that both icons have the right to decide their own ODI futures amid growing speculation over their potential retirements following India's recent Champions Trophy triumph.Patel, who is currently in India as part of New Zealand Prime Minister Christopher Luxon's delegation, acknowledged the immense contributions of the two batting greats and stressed that their decision should be respected.""They're the greats of the game. To be honest, I think they can decide when they want to stop playing. They're well within their rights to go for as long as they want,"" Patel told IANS. ""They've both got phenomenal records and they're both phenomenal players, and I know as a bowler it's always worrying to be able to bowl to either of them.""Virat Kohli was in sublime form throughout India's title-winning campaign in Dubai, scoring 218 runs from five matches at an average of 54.50. Kohli's consistent performances played a pivotal role in India claiming their third Champions Trophy title.Meanwhile, Rohit Sharma further cemented his legacy as a captain by becoming the second most successful Indian skipper in terms of ICC titles. Under Rohit's leadership, India clinched their second ICC silverware in less than nine months after winning the 2024 T20 World Cup.Patel acknowledged India's dominance in the final, saying, ""India just played good cricket on the day, I guess. New Zealand performed really well throughout the tournament and we played some phenomenal cricket. I think the conditions obviously made it tougher as well, but at the end of the day, India played very good cricket and unfortunately we lost on the day.""With the 2025 edition of the Indian Premier League (IPL) set to kick off on March 22, Patel also spoke about the tournament's significance for New Zealand cricketers.""IPL is a massive tournament around the world and it's a highly lauded tournament, so it's always exciting to watch. You get to see some of the best cricket, some of the best players, and obviously the way that it's run and structured is quite impressive,"" he said. ""It's been fantastic for New Zealand players to be able to come over here, challenge themselves, and get exposure on the world stage as well.""",Ajaz Patel says Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma can decide when to retire.

"WPL: Nat Sciver-Brunt has been Mumbai Indians’s MVP, rivals’ envy",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/wpl/wpl-nat-sciver-brunt-has-been-mumbai-indianss-mvp-rivals-envy/articleshow/119030527.cms,"Nat Sciver-Brunt (PTI Photo)

MUMBAI: ""Form goes up and down,” says Nat Sciver-Brunt , so she wants to make the most of it as the “feeling when you are not so confident isn’t that nice.”It’s a captain’s delight to have someone like the England allrounder on the roster. The 32-year-old has unlocked her beast mode for Mumbai Indians this season, topping the Orange Cap list with 493 runs in nine games at an average of 70.42, with the help of five fifties. She already became the first player to score 400-plus runs in WPL history and is just seven runs short of crossing the 500-run mark in a season. She also has nine scalps in her kitty, putting her in the driver’s seat to take the Player of the Tournament award.She also played a stellar role in MI’s title run in the inaugural edition in 2023, scoring 332 runs and taking 10 wickets.A trait of top players is that they always find a way to improve their game consistently, and Sciver-Brunt is among those. During this campaign, she has impressed with her ability to score at a brisk rate through the middle overs. Her career strike rate in T20Is is 118.12, while in WPL it is 143.24, but in this edition, her strike rate stands at 156.50.Other MI batters have benefited from it, as well as her calm approach while batting, which has given the likes of Hayley Matthews and Harmanpreet Kaur the time to build their innings.Sciver-Brunt stressed that she didn’t try anything different in the lead-up to the tournament. “I haven’t done anything different in terms of my preparation or how I go about my innings. I have stuck to my strengths quite a lot and have played what is in front of me,” she said.Besides scoring briskly, what has made her more dangerous is her ability to score all around the park. Fuller lengths have been dispatched down the ground or through the covers, while anything slightly wide or short has been sent to the boundary with ferocity.Sciver-Brunt and Matthews have developed a nice understanding between them, which has seen them stitch match winning partnerships for MI. Like the 71-ball 133-run association against Gujarat Giants in the eliminator on Thursday, which was also their second 100-plus stand of the season. They also put on a 133-run association against UP Warriorz (UPW), besides two 50-plus stands—92 and 57 against UPW and Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB), respectively. She has also taken on the lead role while mentoring the West Indian, who at times has found it difficult to construct her innings.“Apart from this tournament, I haven’t really batted with Hayley, but we seemed to click well from the first year. (Against Giants) she wanted to go off after a quicker start, but it was good she stayed out there and didn’t give her wicket away. I was just reassuring her that you only need to time the ball, you don’t need to whack it,” reasoned Sciver-Brunt.","Nat Sciver-Brunt has scored 493 runs in nine games for Mumbai Indians. The 32-year-old is seven runs short of crossing the 500-run mark in a season. She also has nine scalps in her kitty, putting her in the driver’s seat.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-119030574,imgsize-192130,width-400,resizemode-4/119030574.jpg"

Champions Return: Rohit, Hardik, Shreyas, Gambhir return after India's title triumph

NEW DELHI: The Hundred Draft witnessed a notable absence of Pakistani cricketers , with none of the 50 players from the country receiving bids. This development has sparked discussions and raised questions about the potential factors contributing to this outcome.Among the Pakistani contingent, prominent names such as Naseem Shah , Saim Ayub, and Shadab Khan , who were placed in the top price brackets, failed to attract any bidders.Naseem and Shadab were listed in the highest category of GBP 120,000, while Ayub positioned himself in the GBP 78,500 segment. Similarly, the female cricketers from Pakistan , including Aliya Riaz, Fatima Sana, Yusra Amir, Iram Javed, and Jaweria Rauf, did not receive any offers.One potential reason cited for this lack of interest in Pakistani players is the involvement of Indian Premier League ( IPL ) owners in the Hundred teams.Currently, four IPL franchises hold stakes in various Hundred teams, including Mumbai Indians in Oval Invincibles, Lucknow Super Giants in Manchester Originals, Sunrisers Hyderabad in Northern Superchargers, and Delhi Capitals in Southern Brave.Additionally, Sanjay Govil, an Indian-American entrepreneur, has acquired a 50% stake in Welsh Fire, while Cricket Investor Holdings Limited, a consortium of Silicon Valley tech entrepreneurs, has purchased a 49% stake in London Spirit.While the influence of IPL owners cannot be discounted, another factor that may have contributed to the lack of bids for Pakistani cricketers is their modest form in white-ball formats.The recent performances of these players in limited-overs cricket might have played a role in deterring potential buyers from investing in their services.It is worth noting that last year, players like Naseem Shah and Shaheen Shah Afridi faced challenges related to obtaining No Objection Certificates (NOCs) from the Pakistan Cricket Board ( PCB ), which ultimately curtailed their participation in the Hundred.Such administrative hurdles could also have impacted the decision-making process of the teams during the draft.",The Hundred Draft witnessed a notable absence of Pakistani cricketers.

A day after dethroning reigning champion Jonatan Christie , Lakshya Sen faltered against Li Shi Feng of China 10-21, 16-21 in the men’s singles quarterfinals of the All England Championships in Birmingham on Friday.Soon after, the Indian challenge ended as the women’s doubles pair of Treesa Jolly and Gayatri Gopichand lost to Chinese second seeds Liu Sheng Shu and Tan Ning 14-21, 10-21.Given his 7-4 win-loss record and having won the last two matches against Li last year, Lakshya was expected to fare well in the quarterfinals. But the Indian was a pale shadow of the shuttler on show against Christie.From 4-4, Li widened the gap. He scored eight points on the trot and Lakshya was out of the first game even before he had warmed up.Emboldened by the easy victory in the first game, Li started on an aggressive note while Lakshya crawled his way back. With good netplay and by pushing the shuttle to the corners with good effect, Lakshya secured a crucial three-point lead (11-8) at the halfway stage. However, Li toned down his aggression and scored the next four points by engaging the Indian in long rallies, mostly close to the net. It was anybody’s game till 15-15.Thereafter, Li came up with two smash winners and a lucky net drop to widen the gap to 19-15. Li produced 10 smash winners in the second game to silence Lakshya.The 87-minute three-game second round contest against Koreans Kim Hye Jeong and Kong Hee Yong, late on Thursday affected TreesaGayatri, who had only 14 hours to recover for the quarterfinal.Though they led 10-7 at one stage the duo struggled to move well on the court. The Chinese took off from 7-10 and won 14 of the next 18 points to pocket the first game. In the second game they were even more dominant. “We were slow on the court today. Maybe the long match late last night affected us a bit,” Gayatri said after the match. Chirag Shetty who injured his back in the second round is travelling back to India.

Champions Return: Rohit, Hardik, Shreyas, Gambhir return after India's title triumph

NEW DELHI: Retired Test opener David Warner has cast doubt on whether England’s high-octane "" Bazball "" approach will hold up on Australian soil, insisting it’s a risky tactic against the conditions Down Under.“I don’t know if 'Bazball' is a myth now, but I can’t see it happening in Australia,” the 38-year-old told reporters this week, as quoted by Fox Sports.Warner, who called time on his international career last year, had a front-row seat to England’s aggressive style during the 2023 Ashes . While the approach earned praise for its entertainment value, he believes the fast-paced batting might falter on bouncier Australian pitches .“With the bounce and everything, the fields Australia set last time in England, it would be pretty high risk to play that in Australia,” he said.“It’s probably not the way to go about it. If that is the way they go … it’s going to be high tempo, high energy and we’ll all get a couple of days off at the back end.”England’s ""Bazball"" era, led by Test captain Ben Stokes and coach Brendon McCullum , has seen mixed results since kicking off three years ago. The team surged to a dominant home summer in 2022, then made headlines with a record-breaking 3-0 whitewash in Pakistan.However, their fortunes turned in 2023. England failed to retain the Ashes on home soil and later slumped to a 4-1 series loss in India, reigniting doubts about the long-term sustainability of the ""Bazball"" strategy in varied conditions.Meanwhile, Warner is gearing up for a new challenge. Earlier this week, he was picked up by the London Spirit for AU$245,000 in The Hundred Draft . He’ll reunite with former Australian coach Justin Langer as the 100-ball tournament kicks off in August.Warner’s home ground will be Lord’s—where tensions famously boiled over during the 2023 Ashes, as he and his teammates clashed with MCC members in the Long Room. Asked about the reception he expects from Spirit fans, Warner was candid.“We’ll just have to wait until I step foot on that park first, won’t we? Then we’ll see how the reception is,” he said.“I’ll have to walk past the Long Room first to get to the changing room! I actually want them to come at Australians. I love that stuff, that’s what gets me going but I want them to support London Spirit.ALSO SEE: Why all 50 Pakistan cricketers went unpicked in The Hundred Draft “If they want to boo me, boo me, but don’t boo the team.

India win Champions Trophy title; Rohit Sharma confirms he's not retiring

Dinesh Karthik (C) spoke at the RCB Innovation Labs, Indian Sports Summit in Bengaluru.

Will Rohit Sharma win 2027 World Cup? Astrologer Lobo predicts after getting Champions Trophy bang on!

COUNTRY VS FRANCHISE TALENT IDENTIFICATION

Had India not won the Champions Trophy in Dubai, it is quite conceivable that Rohit Sharma ’s place at the helm of the Indian cricket team would have come under scrutiny. He was on a perilously slippery slope, having fared poorly with the bat in back-to-back series losses against New Zealand and Australia in red-ball cricket. Forget captaincy, his place in the side was questioned. And in Dubai, he faced criticism over his fitness.But success in the white-ball version has shone the spotlight on his leadership acumen. Former Indian wicketkeeper Dinesh Karthik , who was part of the Indian team when they won the Champions Trophy in 2013, watched Rohit and his men’s successful journey from the commentary box recently. He believes Sharma’s leadership skills are second to none.Speaking at RCB Innovation Labs, Indian Sports Summit here on Friday, Karthik said: “In the past nine months, this Indian team has won two massive competitions (T20 World Cup and Champions Trophy). So, I think the sky's the limit for them because they are led by a very able leader in Rohit Sharma. You can see that he’s got the respect of his peers. Most importantly, he walks the walk and talks the talk with how cricket needs to be played.”Still, even with the best leadership, one needs a smattering of talent to go the distance in a multi-team event and the fact wasn’t lost on Karthik. “The beauty of this Indian team is the strength and depth that they have in terms of the number of players that they've got,” he said. “Not many countries today can say that they can field two or three teams in international cricket and have them competing with each other.”Did the IPL have a role in India’s near dominance of white-ball cricket? “India right now is in a very privileged and blessed place where they have such a good assortment of cricketers across skill sets. They could easily compete for the next decade or so considering the assembly line of players that the IPL and Indian domestic cricket are producing. The value in terms of understanding pressure, the big moments is what makes this Indian team really special,” said Karthik, who was in conversation with former England player and commentator Isha Guha and Mo Bobat , Royal Challengers Bengaluru ’s Director of Cricket.The 39-year-old gloveman went on to say: “In a lot of sporting environments, superpowers don’t go on to win tournaments. It’s always a challenge sometimes to just manage and assemble a group of players that produces results.”Once known as the T20 ‘razzmatazz’, Karthik believes the IPL, which turns 18 this year, has ensured a paradigm shift in perception and practice.“For a long time, Team India has been a cricketing nation which used to be happy competing, but now that attitude has changed. We want to win, and fans expect the team to win. That is what IPL has done. The influx of money has meant financial benefits that teams and stakeholders earn and a lot of it has gone back into infrastructure. When infrastructure grows, eventually the quality of sport develops and that’s the two biggest takeaways I think post the introduction of IPL in 2008,” said the current RCB batting coach and mentor.Karthik, who made his IPL debut for the erstwhile Delhi Daredevils, reflected on playing alongside Australian pace Glenn McGrath and the takeaways from it “For me the whole ideology of how Australia played at that time was a massive shock. They felt like a pack of wolves out to win every game. But with IPL, in my first year I got to spend time with Glenn McGrath in close quarters and practice with him. I got to know him better and became comfortable, that helped the confidence and mindset of competing with the best,” he said at the Padukone Dravid Centre of Excellence.Highlighting the difference between talent identification for a national team and a franchise, Bobat, who quit his role as performance director of the England men’s team to join RCB in 2023, stated, “In international cricket we often found that you were trying to really unpick and make sense to identify talent that was playing at a level beneath international cricket and making predictions about whether that talent could thrive at the level above. Coming over to RCB, firstly, it's an international market because you have overseas players. Understanding Indian talent is quite hard because of the volume and unstructured nature of it as well. So, finding talent in India is a much bigger challenge than it is finding it in the UK, but in a good way.”","Dinesh Karthik is the batting coach of the Royal Challengers Bengaluru in the IPL.

WPL Final: Toss crucial in dew-heavy Brabourne as Delhi Capitals and Mumbai Indians clash,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/wpl/wpl-final-toss-crucial-in-dew-heavy-brabourne-as-delhi-capitals-and-mumbai-indians-clash/articleshow/119029922.cms,"Mumbai Indians vs Delhi Capitals (Photo Credit: @wplt20 on X)

MUMBAI: It won’t come as a surprise if Saturday’s WPL finalists—Mumbai Indians and Delhi Capitals—opt to chase if the toss rolls in their favour.Both teams have enjoyed success while hunting down targets this edition.MI have opted to bat second on five occasions and have won four games. DC decided to chase on six occasions and succeeded in five of them, twice against their rivals on Saturday.With both teams batting deep, they feel more comfortable chasing. Many matches going down to the wire this season is a testimony to that as well.MI may look top-heavy with Hayley Matthews, Nat-Sciver Brunt, and skipper Harmanpreet Kaur batting at No. 2, 3, and 4. The small but effective contributions of Amanjot Kaur and Sajeevan Sajana give them that confidence. It’s similar to DC as well. While Meg Lanning , Shafali Verma, Jemimah Rodrigues, and Jess Jonassen have done the heavy lifting for them, they have the likes of Niki Prasad, Sarah Bryce, and Shikha Pandey, among others, to provide that back-up in case the top order has an off day.MI have an edge when it comes to their bowling, especially in the spin department, with off-spinner Matthews and leg-spinner Amelia Kerr among the top two wicket-takers in the tournament.On the eve of the final, while both captains didn’t reveal their cards, they agreed that backing their skills and strengths is what matters. MI’s Harmanpreet said that their decision depends on the “conditions” and they “plan accordingly for it,” but the focus is on doing things they are “comfortable about.” “We never thought too much about winning the toss. It’s just going out there and performing,” she added.Her DC counterpart Lanning assessed: “It’s about what your strengths are and backing that. And throughout the tournament, we’ve done that.” She added: “We’re not too bothered about what we do first. The conditions seem to be similar throughout the match. It’s just about doing whatever we can in that first innings and then backing yourself.”In the last two finals, DC won the toss both times, but their batters failed to put on a fighting total on the board. In the 2023 final, MI restricted them to 131 before registering a seven wicket win. Last edition, Royal Challengers Bengaluru shot them out for 113 before recording an eight-wicket victory.Lanning is aware of it, and she admitted that there’s more on the line in the final than a round game. “We’ve just been focusing on what we can do this year and playing to our strengths, backing ourselves. What’s happened in the round games, doesn’t count for anything. It’s about performing tomorrow night,” said Lanning.MI will be playing their fourth match in six days, while Capitals have had a seven-day break. Both captains had a different take on their schedule. While Harmanpreet felt that it “will play to their advantage” as they “now know the conditions well”, Lanning felt that the break gave them time to “refresh” themselves and the conditions won’t be alien as a lot of their players have played here.","Both teams have enjoyed success while hunting down targets this edition.

The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has served a legal notice to South African cricketer Corbin Bosch for breaching his contract by failing to honour his commitment to the Pakistan Super League PSL ).Bosch, who made his international debut against Pakistan earlier this year, was selected by Peshawar Zalmi in the Diamond category during the PSL Players Draft held in Lahore on January 13. His sudden withdrawal from the tournament has sparked controversy, especially after he was announced as a replacement player for the injured Lizaad Williams by the Mumbai Indians , a franchise in the Indian Premier League ( IPL ).The PCB has sent the legal notice through Bosch's representative, demanding an explanation for his decision to pull out of the PSL despite being contracted to play. The board has also outlined the potential consequences of his exit from the tournament and has given him a specific period to respond.The situation has drawn significant attention as it comes at a time when the PSL and IPL schedules are set to overlap for the first time since the PSL’s inception in 2016. The PCB was compelled to adjust the PSL schedule from its usual February-March window to April-May due to the Champions Trophy and other international fixtures hosted in Pakistan. This shift has created challenges for players juggling commitments to both leagues.Bosch's unexpected departure from the PSL has raised questions about player loyalty and contract enforcement, especially considering that several international cricketers who went unsold at the IPL auction later registered for the PSL.","The Pakistan Cricket Board has served a legal notice to South African cricketer Corbin Bosch for breaching his contract.

Legendary cricketer Sachin Tendulkar has been testing products from his new sports athleisure brand , “Ten X You,” through the ongoing International Maters League. This venture, under the company SRT10 Athleisure Pvt. Ltd., has Tendulkar blending his cricketing expertise with a hands-on approach to product development.Tendulkar, alongside former Swiggy executives Karthik Gurumurthy and Karan Arora, launched SRT10 Athleisure last year with backing from Peak XV (formerly Sequoia) and Whiteboard Capital.Unlike typical celebrity endorsements, Tendulkar’s involvement goes far beyond being a mere face. Sources close to the project reveal that he has been deeply engaged in shaping the brand’s vision and strategy of driving accessibility to premium sporting goods through local manufacturing. He has also been working closely with design and product teams for over six months.The initial product lineup includes athleisure apparel and footwear, with a focus on cricket and training gear—items which Tendulkar has been spotted sporting during the league.Fans and keen observers have noticed Tendulkar sporting prototype cricket shoes, training apparel, and even luggage throughout the tournament. Insiders say he’s been in constant communication with his product teams, offering feedback to refine designs and functionality.But Tendulkar isn’t the first athlete to test products mid-competition.Basketball icon Michael Jordan famously debuted early Air Jordan prototypes during NBA games in the 1980s, a move that not only showcased the shoes but also built the brand’s mystique.Similarly, tennis star Serena Williams wore her Nike-backed apparel line during Grand Slams, refining designs through real-time performance.'Ten X You' aims at offering affordable, locally manufactured products — a nod to India’s growing sports goods market and government policies promoting domestic production. With footwear dominating 60% of the market and apparel at 30%, Tendulkar’s venture taps into a rising demand for premium, yet accessible, gear.","Sachin Tendulkar has been testing products from his new sports athleisure brand.

New Zealand registered a convincing nine-wicket win over Pakistan in the first T20I on Sunday in Christchurch as the visitors received a thrashing after being dismissed for their lowest T20I total in New Zealand.Kiwi fast bowlers Jacob Duffy (4 for 14) and Kyle Jamieson (3 for 8) delivered outstanding performances, collectively claiming seven wickets to dismantle Pakistan's batting order. 'Player of the Match' Jamieson's early spell proved decisive as he captured three crucial wickets, leaving Pakistan struggling at 11 for 4 within 4.4 overs.However, NZ skipper Michael Bracewell felt they could have bowled out Pakistan for lower than 91 had he asked Jamieson to bowl his fourth and last over on the trot.""I had to hold Kyle back for the 4th over; he was ready and at the top of his mark...but it's always a challenge to rotate the bowlers around, especially in shorter formats like the T20s...maybe we could have restricted them to a lesser score,"" said Bracewell.Openers Finn Allen (29 not out) and Tim Seifert (44) then added 53 runs in 5.5 overs before the latter was sent back by spinner Abrar Ahmed as the only wicket to fall in New Zealand's run-chase, which was completed off the first ball of the 11th over.Speaking of his performance, Jamieson said: ""It was nice to be back on home soil, in favourable conditions. Myself and Duffy, we'll take these conditions and it was nice to cash in...Needed to keep the seam upright, it made our job easy and was a clinical team performance.""Jamieson also praised fellow pacer Duffy's four-wicket effort.""He did an outstanding job, at the top and the back-end as well,"" said the tall pacer.Pakistan's previous lowest total in a T20I in New Zealand was 101 in Wellington during the 2016 tour.The second T20I of the five-match series will be played in Dunedin on Tuesday.","New Zealand beat Pakistan by nine wickets in the first T20I in Christchurch.

Virat Kohli has revealed that India's recent tour of Australia was one of his most disappointing experiences, drawing parallels with his challenging 2014 England tour where he failed to score a single fifty in 10 innings.India suffered a 3-1 defeat in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy against Australia, which was played from November 22 to January 5.Kohli's performance in the series mirrored his struggles in England, particularly with deliveries outside the off stump. Despite scoring an unbeaten century in India's win at Perth, his form deteriorated significantly. He managed only 190 runs at an average of 23.75 across nine innings, with eight dismissals to catches behind the wicket.""If you ask me the intensity of how disappointed I've been, the most recent Australia tour would be the one that's most fresh. So it might feel the most intense to me.""""For a long time, the tour of England in 2014 bothered me the most. But I can't look at it that way. I might not have an Australia tour again in four years. I don't know. You have to make peace with whatever's happened in your life. In 2014, I still had the chance to go in 2018 and do what I did. It might not have been the case. It might have been another blunder. But it didn't turn out that way.""""So, there's no such guarantees in life. I think when you are at a stage for a long period of time, when you perform, people get used to your performances. They start feeling for you more than you feel sometimes. This has to be corrected.""Kohli acknowledged that his mounting failures in Australia led to increased desperation to correct his mistakes. He later realised the importance of accepting disappointment rather than rushing into changes.""Once you start taking on the energy and the disappointment from the outside, then you start burdening yourself way more. And then you start thinking about things, like 'I've got two or three days left on this tour, I need to make an impact now.' And you start getting more desperate. That's something I've surely experienced in Australia as well.""""Because I got a good score in the first Test. I thought, right, 'let's go.' There's going to be another big series for me. It doesn't turn out that way. For me, it's just about the acceptance of, 'okay fine, this is what happened. I'm going to be honest with myself. Where do I want to go? What are my energy levels like?'""""I'm not sitting here in 48 hours or 72 hours-time to make a decision like 'let me go.' Spend time with family. Just sit down. Let everything calm down. And see how I feel in a few days. And within five-six days I was excited to go to the gym. I was like, okay fine. It's all good. I don't need to tweet anything right now.""""Me playing the game is not for achievement. It pretty much comes down to just the pure joy and enjoyment and love for the game. And as long as that love is intact, I will continue to play the game. I have to be honest about that with myself. Because the competitive streak doesn't allow you to find the answer.""""Recently, I had a very interesting conversation with Rahul Dravid when he was our coach. He said you always have to stay in touch with yourself. Figure out where you are placed in your life. And the answer is not that easy, because you might be going through a lean phase and you feel like 'this is it.' But it might not be.""""But then when it was time, he said my competitive streak would not allow me to accept it. Maybe one more. Maybe six more months, whatever. So, I think it's a fine balance. And you have to just pray and hope that you get clarity when it comes. At this point in my life, I feel pretty happy. I still love playing the game. Don't get nervous, I'm not making any announcements, as of now, everything is fine.""",India suffered a 3-1 defeat in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy against Australia.

Barcelona secured a dramatic 4-2 victory against Atletico Madrid after coming back from a two-goal deficit in Sunday's crucial Spanish league match .Lamine Yamal and Ferran Torres scored in stoppage time, helping Barcelona reclaim the top spot in the standings after Real Madrid had temporarily moved ahead following their win against Villarreal on Saturday.Barcelona and Real Madrid are now level on 60 points, with Barcelona holding a game in hand. Atletico Madrid sits four points behind the leaders following their home defeat against Hansi Flick's team, completing a disappointing week after their Champions League exit.""How we play, the confidence we have, it's really good to see. We will try everything to win trophies, the match today gives us more confidence,"" said Flick.Barcelona, who had previously suffered late setbacks against Atletico this season, turned the tables this time, extending their unbeaten run to 18 matches across all competitions.The match saw Julian Alvarez and Alexander Sorloth put Atletico ahead before Robert Lewandowski and Torres equalised for Barcelona, who ultimately secured victory in added time.""I think that after the anger, the feeling of impotence, not being comfortable in the game, we put our best foot forward and gave the best that we have. It was a very important game to win in the end, beating Atletico was a statement win, we put ourselves back as leaders having played a game fewer and we're very happy,"" Yamal told DAZN.Flick had earlier cautioned his players about maintaining focus, following a December incident where they conceded a 96th-minute goal to Atletico, losing their league lead in a 2-1 home defeat.Barcelona's first significant opportunity came near halftime when Pedri set up Lewandowski, whose powerful shot hit the crossbar.Atletico immediately capitalised on the subsequent goal kick, with Antoine Griezmann providing a brilliant pass to Giuliano Simeone, leading to Alvarez's opener.The goal provided some consolation for Alvarez, who had experienced disappointment earlier in the week when his penalty against Real Madrid was controversially disallowed during their Champions League elimination.Diego Simeone refreshed his team with substitutes following their Champions League exit, bringing on Sorloth and Conor Gallagher, who combined for Atletico's second goal.Griezmann played a crucial role in another well-executed team move, with Gallagher assisting Sorloth for his 11th league goal of the season.Barcelona quickly responded despite their protests about a Rodrigo De Paul handball being dismissed. Martinez launched an attack and found Lewandowski, who controlled well and scored.Torres then equalised after receiving a cross from Raphinha, before Yamal's deflected long-range effort put Barcelona ahead in stoppage time.""We have to congratulate our opponent, they had a good game and in the end were very effective with their chances. They had that bit of luck which you have to have, in the deflection for Yamal's goal for 3-2,"" said Simeone.Torres sealed the victory with his second goal in the closing moments.""It was a strange game because we did well in the first half, we had them under control and scored two goals... it's true the 120 minutes in the Champions League weighed on us, and in the end the team fell apart. We will fight to the end (for La Liga ), we have seen many times how things change, you have a good month and someone else has a bad one, and you turn it all around,"" said Atletico's Llorente.",Barcelona come from two goals down to beat Atletico Madrid 4-2 in La Liga.

Leicester set unwanted record

Chelsea 's bid for a Champions League spot weakened following their lifeless 0-1 loss at Arsenal on Sunday, while Fulham secured a 2-0 victory against Tottenham. Manchester United continued their upward trend with a 3-0 win at Leicester.A solitary goal from Mikel Merino settled an uninspiring match at the Emirates, helping Arsenal strengthen their second position and reduce Liverpool's advantage to 12 points.The absence of Cole Palmer through illness proved costly for Chelsea, who delivered a lacklustre performance that hampered their top-four aspirations.Despite maintaining fourth position presently, Chelsea face pressure from five clubs between Manchester City in fifth and Aston Villa in ninth, all within four points of Enzo Maresca's side.Arsenal's goalscoring difficulties have persisted since Kai Havertz's season-ending injury forced midfielder Merino to adopt a forward position. The Spanish international proved decisive from a corner, heading in Martin Odegaard's delivery at the far post after 20 minutes.Whilst Chelsea created few chances, they nearly equalised when David Raya mishandled Marc Cucurella's attempt, with the ball rolling wide.Robert Sanchez produced an excellent save to prevent Merino from scoring Arsenal's second, in what was the half's finest attempt.The match concluded quietly with minimal attacking threat, as the subdued display intensified criticism of Maresca's tactical approach amongst Chelsea supporters.""We did enough to deserve to win the game,"" said Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta. ""Now we have the international break so let's take a chance to breathe and bring some players back hopefully.""Tottenham, fresh from their Europa League quarter-final qualification against AZ Alkmaar on Thursday, experienced another post-European setback at Craven Cottage.Fulham's triumph elevates Marco Silva's team to eighth position, four points from fourth place and three behind fifth.A fifth-place finish should secure Champions League participation next season, owing to English clubs' strong European performances.Spurs have struggled with their Premier League form following European fixtures, winning just three of 10 league matches after Europa League games.Ange Postecoglou's team were second-best throughout, conceding in the 78th minute when Rodrigo Muniz converted Andreas Pereira's pass. Ryan Sessegnon sealed the victory against his previous club with an elegant finish.""It's been a difficult campaign for sure,"" said Spurs captain Son Heung-min.""But I feel we've lost too many games that we should have got stuff out of, and this was one of those games.""United extended their unbeaten streak in open play to seven matches with a convincing win over a struggling Leicester side.Rasmus Hojlund broke his 21-game goal drought by scoring to put United ahead in the 28th minute.Alejandro Garnacho had to be patient for his first goal since November, having been flagged offside early in the second half. However, he eventually found the net with a quick shot that Mads Hermansen should have saved.This victory marked United’s fourth win against Leicester this season, including two matches where Ruud van Nistelrooy served as the interim manager for the Red Devils. Unfortunately for the Dutchman, he hasn't achieved the same success at the King Power Stadium.Leicester's situation has worsened, suffering 13 losses in their last 14 league games and now sitting nine points behind safety. Additionally, they set an unwanted record as the first Premier League team to go seven home games without scoring.Bruno Fernandes capped off United's victory with a brilliant strike from the edge of the box, marking his seventh goal in as many games.",Arsenal beat Chelsea 0-1 at the Emirates.

It will be a challenging task, but senior defender Sandesh Jhingan expressed on Saturday that the Indian football team aims to defeat Maldives and Bangladesh without conceding a goal in the upcoming international matches.

And I want more.

Instead, he framed the moment as a reminder of Haaland’s importance in the club’s final run-in.“He has to help us more and more to achieve what we want to do this season,” Guardiola added. “But the numbers are unbelievable since he arrived… hopefully he can reach that little record tomorrow.”City, who trail Liverpool in the title race, are focused on securing Champions League qualification with 10 league games to go. Guardiola acknowledged a dip in performance levels compared to previous title-winning campaigns, attributing it to the fierce competition across the league.“We helped raise the bar in the Premier League,” he said. “Now, every team is organised, structured, with good players and good ideas.

NEW DELHI: Brazilian football superstar Neymar has been ruled out of the upcoming World Cup qualifiers against Colombia and Argentina due to fitness concerns.The Brazilian Football Confederation announced this decision through a video statement by coach Dorival Júnior, who cited unspecified reasons for the exclusion of Neymar, goalkeeper Ederson, and defender Danilo from the squad.The 33-year-old striker, who recently rejoined his former club Santos in January, last played on March 2 but was substituted due to an apparent left thigh injury. As a precautionary measure, he was rested for the Sao Paulo state championship semifinal against Corinthians a few days later.Neymar's absence has paved the way for Real Madrid's promising young striker, Endrick, to be called up to the national team squad. Ederson's replacement is Lyon's Lucas Perri, while Flamengo defender Danilo has been replaced by his club teammate and Brazil veteran, Alex Sandro.Neymar's return to the national team setup this month marked a significant milestone, as he had been absent for almost 1 1/2 years due to an ACL injury sustained in October 2023 while playing for Brazil against Uruguay. His recent recovery and return to action had raised hopes for his participation in the upcoming qualifiers.Brazil, currently fifth in the South American qualifying standings, faces a crucial double-header, hosting Colombia on March 20 before traveling to Buenos Aires to take on the group leaders, Argentina, five days later.The absence of key players like Neymar, Ederson, and Danilo undoubtedly presents a challenge for the Brazilian team. However, it also provides an opportunity for emerging talents like Endrick and others to step up and showcase their abilities on the international stage.","Neymar has been ruled out of the upcoming World Cup qualifiers against Colombia and Argentina due to fitness concerns.

It wasn’t a great few weeks for me. I was struggling so much with my health, I was fatigued, I was barely practicing. And when I practiced or played I would feel super tired.”“It has been good in the last two weeks.

Sabalenka trounces Keys in Australian Open re-match

Russian teenager Mirra Andreeva ended the defending champion Iga Swiatek 's quest for a historic third Indian Wells title, defeating the world number two 7-6 (1), 1-6, 6-3 on Friday to advance to the final.At just 17, Andreeva snapped Swiatek's 10-match winning streak at Indian Wells, marking her second victory over the Polish star in three weeks—having previously triumphed in Dubai's quarter-finals en route to becoming the youngest WTA 1000 champion ever.On Sunday, Andreeva will face Aryna Sabalenka , who dominated Australian Open champion Madison Keys . The American veteran Keys had denied Sabalenka a third consecutive title in Melbourne, where she claimed her first major in January.Andreeva is the youngest finalist at Indian Wells since Kim Clijsters, who was 17 in 2001.In the match against Swiatek, Andreeva showcased her skills in the first set tiebreaker and managed to regroup after a challenging second set.Although Swiatek started confidently, dropping only one point in her first three service games, Andreeva seized a 5-4 lead with a crucial break, benefiting from a double fault by Swiatek. The match proceeded to a tiebreaker where Andreeva dominated.""I felt like I'm gonna go and play the tiebreak like it's the last tiebreak of my life,"" she said. ""So I just went for all my shots. My serve was great. I just felt super comfortable and confident,"" she said.""I saw my mom's nervous face in the big screen,"" Andreeva told the crowd. ""I tried not to look there.""Despite Swiatek rebounding in the second set with three breaks, the momentum shifted back to Andreeva in the third. She ultimately secured victory with her third break of the set.""I just decided to kind of still play the same but maybe go for my shots more, trying to play a little bit more aggressive,"" she said.""I feel also that I was dealing with the nerves and the pressure pretty good, so I just feel proud of myself.""World number one Aryna Sabalenka dispatched Madison Keys 6-0, 6-1 to reach the Indian Wells final, avenging her loss to the fifth-ranked American in the Australian Open final.In just 51 minutes, Sabalenka set up a title match against Andreeva.The Belarusian, seeking revenge after her January defeat to Keys, was sharp from the start, completing the first set in just 23 minutes.""I was hungry,"" said Sabalenka, who had made no bones about wanting revenge. ""That Australian Open match was really heartbroken for me, and I really needed some time to recover after that.""And if I would lose today again, it would get in my head and I didn't want that to happen. I was really focused -- I was just really hungry to get this win against Madison.""Keys, who had a 16-match winning streak culminating in her Australian Open victory, struggled to make an impact.""I think tactically I played really great tennis,"" said Sabalenka, adding her strategy was to ""just keep her out of the rhythm"".Despite overcoming the cold, swirling winds on Stadium Court and winning the first 11 games, Sabalenka's dominance was clear. Keys managed to hold serve for the first time at 5-1 in the second set, but Sabalenka quickly closed out the match.This marks Sabalenka's second appearance in the Indian Wells final; she was the runner-up to Elena Rybakina in 2023.","Russian teenager Mirra Andreeva beat defending champion Iga Swiatek 7-6 (1), 1-6, 6-3.

Madison Keys powered into the Indian Wells semifinals on Thursday, dismantling wild-card Belinda Bencic 6-1, 6-1 in just 65 minutes to notch her 16th straight victory. The fifth-seeded American, who claimed the Australian Open title earlier this year, now sets up a highly anticipated rematch with world No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka . The two last met at Melbourne Park in January, where Keys defeated Sabalenka in a three-set battle, halting the Belarusian’s bid for a third straight title.Despite upsetting No. 4 seed Coco Gauff in the previous round, Bencic — a 28-year-old from Switzerland — had no answers for Keys’ relentless play.Elsewhere in the women’s draw, defending champion Iga Swiatek continued her dominant run in the California desert, advancing to her fourth straight semifinal at Indian Wells with a 6-3, 6-3 win over eighth-seeded Qinwen Zheng. Swiatek, the No. 2 seed and a five-time Grand Slam winner, is aiming to become the first woman to win the event three times. She’s riding a 10-match win streak at Indian Wells, having also lifted the trophy in 2022.Zheng, who had ended Swiatek’s 25-match winning streak at the Paris Olympics last year, couldn’t replicate that magic. Though she broke Swiatek twice and won six games — equaling the total games Swiatek had lost all tournament — the Polish star converted all five of her break points to seal the match.In the men’s draw, two-time defending champion Carlos Alcaraz fought off determined challenger Francisco Cerundolo 6-3, 7-6 (7/4) to reach the semi-finals.On another cold, blustery night in the California desert, Alcaraz battled back from 1-4 down in the second set, coming up with a break and two love service holds to force the tiebreaker as he kept his bid to join Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic as the only men to win three straight Indian Wells titles on track.Alcaraz had to save break points in each of his first three service games. But after an emphatic hold for 4-3 he gained the first break of the contest with a deft volley and just like that he was serving for the first set.After sliding to pop a drop volley winner over the net for set point Alcaraz drilled a deep forehand that Cerundolo could barely get a racquet on.But it was Cerundolo who broke first in the second, finally converting his ninth break point of the match then holding for 4-1.But he couldn't hold off the world number three, who raced to a 5-2 lead in the tiebreaker on the way to victory.""It was really difficult for me to start the match,"" said Alcaraz, who looked less comfortable in the windy weather than he did just a day before.""He got a lot of chances in the first set,"" Alcaraz said. ""I'm just pleased about saving all of them and taking the only one that I had.""I didn't hit the ball as clear as yesterday, but I just did what I had to and that's what it's about.""Alcaraz next faces Britain's Jack Draper, who reached his first Masters 1000 semi-final with a 6-4, 7-5 victory over American Ben Shelton.Draper took the opening set with one break of serve then rallied from 0-3 down in a second-set slug-fest.Shelton's 32 unforced errors included five double-faults -- including one to hand Draper a break for 6-5 in the second.Russian Daniil Medvedev , runner-up to Alcaraz each of the past two years, rallied from a break down in a wild, wind-blown final set to beat Arthur Fils 6-4, 2-6, 7-6 (9/7).The world number six booked a semi-final meeting with Denmark's Holger Rune , a 5-7, 6-0, 6-3 winner over Tallon Griekspoor.Medvedev, a six-time Grand Slam finalist, trailed 20-year-old Fils 2-4 in the third set of a compelling clash that was momentarily paused as gusting winds sent towels and trash cans flying on Stadium Court.France's Fils had shown admirable maturity in the face of Medvedev's formidable defensive skills.He cut down on the unforced errors that marred his first set to win the second with ease and maintained his poise as he erased an early break in the third to seize the lead.But Medvedev wouldn't be denied and after forcing the tiebreaker prevailed on his third match point when Fils pushed a backhand volley long.Medvedev, who had won just one of his past nine third-set tiebreakers, gave a leap of sheer joy after securing the win in 2 hours and 25 minutes to keep alive his bid for a first title since 2023 -- when he won five.""I lost a lot of tight matches this year where I could have won, should have won maybe,"" Medvedev said. ""I have lost a lot of tight matches where it goes a little bit 50-50 and the more it goes like that, the more you can lose confidence in the tight moments.""I was happy I was able to get over the line as he saved some match points and had a break lead in the third. I am just happy to win.""Medvedev faces another young gun in Rune, who burst onto the scene in 2022 with a win over Novak Djokovic in the Paris Masters final.Rune has struggled often since, but after dropping the first set he dominated Griekspoor, the 43rd-ranked Dutchman who had ousted top-seeded Alexander Zverev in the second round.","Madison Keys crushes wild-card Belinda Bencic 6-1,6-1 in just 65 minutes to notch her 16th straight victory.

NEW DELHI: Mirra Andreeva ’s stunning rise in the WTA rankings has been so rapid that even the 17-year-old Russian admits she can’t quite keep up with it. Just last month in Dubai, she made history as the youngest-ever WTA 1000 champion , defeating both Grand Slam winners Iga Swiatek and Elena Rybakina on her way to the title — a win that catapulted her into the top 10 for the first time, landing at No. 9.Now at Indian Wells , Andreeva entered the tournament ranked 11th, but wins over Rybakina once again in the fourth round and Elina Svitolina in the quarter-finals are expected to lift her back into the top 10. Not that she’s been checking too closely.""Before, I was always checking live rankings because before I was playing for a dog,"" Andreeva said with a smile. ""So after every match I play I would check the live rankings to see if I did it.""That milestone — breaking into the top 20 — came after she defeated Magda Linette in Beijing last October. The reward? A promise of a dog. But even now, the pet hasn’t arrived yet, as she’s still narrowing down her choice.""I'm thinking to get an ultra mini labradoodle ,"" she revealed. ""It's going to be a labrador mixed with poodle and it's ultra min, so going to be even smaller than a mini version. It's going to take time until the dog that I want will be born.""While rankings may not be her primary focus anymore, Andreeva is channeling her energy into what’s right in front of her — like an upcoming semi-final clash at Indian Wells against defending champion Swiatek. Despite her recent win over the Pole in Dubai, she’s not expecting it to give her any advantage.""It doesn't give me any benefit to our match (on Friday),"" she admitted.Tennis has become increasingly serious for the teenager, but she's not letting that take the fun out of the game completely. The young star, who draws inspiration from athletes like Roger Federer and LeBron James, is trying to balance focus with enjoyment.""When I was a bit younger it would all be about having fun,"" Andreeva said. ""But now I start to understand that it's pretty serious what I do out here. I feel like when I have fun on the court I play great tennis, so I still try to not be super, super serious but also to have fun a little bit.""So while a top-10 return and a potential title shot are on the horizon, Andreeva remains grounded — eyes on the next match, and perhaps more importantly, on the tiny dog she’s patiently waiting for.","Mirra Andreeva's rise in the WTA rankings has been so rapid that even the 17-year-old Russian admits she can’t keep up with it.

NEW DELHI: Carlos Alcaraz , the two-time defending champion, showcased his dominance at the ATP Indian Wells Masters on Wednesday. The world number three from Spain overcame the challenging windy conditions on Stadium Court to deliver a commanding performance against Grigor Dimitrov , defeating him 6-1, 6-1.Alcaraz's victory denied Dimitrov's bid to join Canadian Felix Auger-Aliassime as the only players to beat the Spaniard in three consecutive meetings. The Bulgarian had previously won their last two encounters, including the quarter-finals at the Miami Open last year.With his 50th ATP Masters 1000 match win, Alcaraz kept his hopes alive of joining Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic as the only men to win three consecutive Indian Wells titles.Having reached the fourth round without dropping a set, Alcaraz produced his most impressive performance of the tournament. Despite the swirling winds that caused ball kids to scramble after blowing trash, Alcaraz appeared supremely untroubled.He broke Dimitrov's serve to open the match and secured the first set with another break. Alcaraz didn't face a break point until the fifth game of the second set, but he overcame that challenge with an ace on Dimitrov's third break chance. Alcaraz then broke the Bulgarian's serve to take a 5-1 lead.Alcaraz sealed the victory in style, earning a match point with his sixth ace of the match and clinching the win with a forehand winner. He will next face Argentina's Francisco Cerundolo , who defeated Australian Alex de Minaur 7-5, 6-3, for a place in the semi-finals.","Carlos Alcaraz defeated Grigor Dimitrov 6-1, 6- 1 in the fourth round of the ATP Indian Wells Masters.

NEW DELHI: Belinda Bencic produced a stunning comeback to upset world number three Coco Gauff on Wednesday, booking her place in the Indian Wells quarter-finals where she will face Australian Open champion Madison Keys .The Swiss star, who gave birth to her daughter Bella last April, triumphed 3-6, 6-3, 6-4 to reach her first WTA 1000 quarter-final since becoming a mother. Unranked when she returned to the tour in October, Bencic has steadily climbed back, capturing her ninth career title in Abu Dhabi last month and rising to 58th in the world this week.“I just kept on working also on the physical side,” Bencic said. “In the last matches in tournaments, I was able to play back-to-back, some three-set matches, and am fresher every time. The body is holding up much better, almost like it was before.”Bencic showed remarkable poise against Gauff, recovering from a first-set loss and keeping the American under constant pressure. Gauff, who had beaten Bencic at the Australian Open earlier this year, struggled with her forehand and gave away the crucial break with a loose return at 4-4 in the deciding set.Keys also had to fight back in her match, defeating Croatia’s Donna Vekic 4-6, 7-6 (9/7), 6-3. After failing to convert a set point in the second set and trailing 3-5 in the tiebreak, the American dug deep and eventually powered through, breaking twice in the third set to seal victory with a fierce backhand return.In the men’s draw, Ben Shelton downed Brandon Nakashima 7-6 (8/6), 6-1 to reach his third ATP Masters 1000 quarter-final.

But as thrilled as the crowd was, Rune was just as excited — at least until he saw the replay.""You know, I kind of had the expectation that I looked like Roger Federer when I hit it, and I didn't quite do that,"" Rune said with a laugh after his 6-4, 6-4 win.

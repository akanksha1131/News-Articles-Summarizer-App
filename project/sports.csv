Pakistan vs New Zealand Super 8s weather report: What happens if PAK-NZ gets called off?



Pakistan will lock horns with New Zealand in their first Super 8 clash of the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup 2026 at the R Premadasa Stadium in Colombo on Saturday. With a storied rivalry and plenty at stake, the contest promises to be a high-intensity encounter between two evenly matched sides.This will be the 50th T20I meeting between Pakistan and New Zealand, underlining how closely contested this rivalry has been in the shortest format. Of the 49 matches played so far, Pakistan have won 24, New Zealand 23, while two games ended in ties — a near-perfect split that highlights the fine margins between the teams.Since January 2022 alone, the two sides have faced each other 24 times in T20Is. New Zealand hold a slight edge with 13 wins compared to Pakistan’s nine. However, Pakistan fans draw confidence from their memorable victory in the 2022 T20 World Cup semi-final, where they defeated the Black Caps to book a place in the final.New Zealand and Pakistan last played a T20 match in March last year, when New Zealand hosted the 2009 T20 World Cup champions for a three-match series, which the home side won 2-1.Performance of both teams in their last 5 matchesIn this edition, both teams have blown hot and cold. Pakistan suffered a setback against India in the group stage, while New Zealand went down to South Africa.As a result, both finished second in their respective groups and now find themselves in a challenging Super 8 group that also includes England and Sri Lanka.Form-wise, Pakistan come into the game with three wins in their last five matches (W, W, W, L, W), while New Zealand’s recent run reads L, W, W, L, W — again reflecting how evenly matched the sides are.While the cricketing rivalry adds spice, the weather in Colombo could play a decisive role. Rain is forecast before and during the match, which is scheduled to begin at 7 PM local time. Showers are expected during the first half, with temperatures hovering between 24 and 26 degrees Celsius and humidity above 80 per cent.There is no reserve day for this Super 8 fixture. If the match is abandoned due to rain, both teams will share one point each — a scenario that could severely dent their semi-final hopes.Officials will have an additional 90 minutes on the day to try and force a result, but if even a five-over contest isn’t possible, the game will be called off.","Pakistan face New Zealand in their first Super 8 clash of the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup 2026 at the R Premadasa Stadium in Colombo on Saturday.

New Zealand hold intense nets before Super Eight match vs Pakistan | T20 World Cup

Veteran Pakistan batter Ahmed Shehzad has strongly criticised all-rounder Shadab Khan following the latter’s recent comments aimed at former national players. The backlash comes in the wake of Pakistan’s defeat to India in the T20 World Cup, a result that triggered widespread criticism of the Salman Ali Agha-led side.In response to former cricketers questioning the team’s performance, Shadab had pointed out that he had at least been part of a Pakistan side that beat India in an ICC event — something he suggested the previous generation could not accomplish. The remark did not sit well with Shehzad.Speaking during a television debate, Shehzad launched a fierce attack, questioning Shadab’s place in the national team and accusing him of benefiting from undue support. He alleged that the all-rounder had not done enough in domestic cricket to justify his selection and hinted at preferential treatment.""First of all, you came in through the back door (Ek to aap chor raastey se aaye ho). You're neither a performer nor a regular in domestic cricket. Despite not performing at all, you're getting the backing. You didn't even do rehab after getting injured. They axed Hasan Ali from the central contracts, but not you.If that's not favoritism, then I don't know what is. It doesn't look good when you make such statements. And you're comparing yourself with the team from the 90s? They had their issues and lost to India in World Cups, but they were far superior to you. Look at their performances; they dominated India during that period. Just because two former players criticized the team, you suddenly forgot the backing they gave you. So, learn to respect your seniors,"" said Shehzad.The debate also featured former Pakistan pacer Mohammad Amir and ex-wicketkeeper Rashid Latif, both of whom weighed in on the controversy.Amir expressed disappointment over Shadab’s timing, suggesting that such remarks were inappropriate during an ongoing tour.""If you're on tour, there will be criticism. So, you've got no right to say such things when you are on tour. Even we used to get criticized during tours, but my focus was to shut those critics up with my performances. So, if you're not performing, you should keep quiet,"" Amir noted.Latif, meanwhile, offered a pointed response of his own.""Shadab should get credit for showing the courage to say what he said. Everyone has the right to speak, so it is okay,"" Latif added in a sarcastic tone.",Ahmed Shehzad has strongly criticised all-rounder Shadab Khan following the latter's recent comments aimed at former national players.

New Zealand hold intense nets before Super Eight match vs Pakistan | T20 World Cup

After returning figures of 4/27 to earn the Player of the Match award, Adam Zampa conceded that Australia’s emphatic nine-wicket win over Oman did little to soften the blow of their early exit from the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup 2026.“To be honest, it has been a rough few days for us,” Zampa said after the match. “The voice in our changeroom has been pretty quiet as we are very disappointed that our World Cup is ending so soon,” he said.Captain Mitchell Marsh capped the group stage with a blazing half-century as Australia signed off on a high, underlining their superiority over Oman. Zampa led the charge with the ball in what was a one-sided contest from start to finish, but the dominant display could not alter Australia’s fate in the tournament.Having opted to field first, Australia bundled Oman out for 104 in 16.2 overs. Zampa ripped through the middle order to derail the innings, while Glenn Maxwell, Xavier Bartlett, Marcus Stoinis and Nathan Ellis ensured there was no way back.Despite his four-wicket haul, Zampa reflected candidly on his overall campaign. “I think that I could've done more in that Sri Lanka game. My contribution in that game was not good at all.I think that I could've done better in that game. My job is to get wickets through the middle,” he said.Australia then chased down the modest 105-run target in just 9.4 overs, with Marsh smashing 64 off 33 balls and Travis Head adding 32 off 19 in a 93-run opening stand. But individual success offered little consolation to Zampa.“You would always like to have wickets rather than not having. I am not thinking about that much. I am disappointed that our tournament ended today.“We have built this squad in the last few years, but we failed to do our jobs right,” he added.",Adam Zampa takes four wickets in Australia's nine-wicket win over Oman. Captain Mitchell Marsh hits 64 as Australia reach Super Eight. Zampa says it has been a 'rough few days' for his side. Australia will now face New Zealand in the semi- finals on Sunday.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128631233,imgsize-79604,width-400,resizemode-4/australia-2102-sd.jpg"

Pakistan hockey captain Ammad Shakeel Butt criticised Pakistan Hockey Federation after troubled Australia tour during which his side didn't just have to roam the streets for lack of accommodation but also ""wash dishes before going to play a match"".Speaking to reporters at Lahore Airport, early this morning that the Pakistan Hockey Federation had been telling them lies and ""enough was enough"".""We can't work with this current management of the federation.

Pakistan lost 2-3 to Australia in their first FIH Pro League match and went on to lose all their matches during the Australia leg, including games against Australia and Germany.Butt said the situation was embarrassing and affected the team’s performance.""What was pathetic was that even the Airbnb accommodation was arranged for 10 days when we had to stay for 13 days. We had to move into a cheaper residence after 10-days,"" Butt said.The Pakistan Sports Board said it had given more than 10 million rupees to the federation for hotel arrangements. Its Director-General, Noor us Sabah, said a detailed report is being prepared for Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, who has ordered an inquiry into the matter.The Sharif is the patron-in-chief of the PHF.Butt also revealed that players were warned not to speak to the media.""I am speaking up because of what we have been through in Australia,"" he said.""We need a foreign coach if we have to move forward.

Netherlands

A dominant India will be hoping that Abhishek Sharma rediscovers his destructive form and that the rest of the batting lineup steps up against spin when they take on the Netherlands in their final T20 World Cup league match on Wednesday. Despite being one of the most dangerous batters over the past 18 months, Abhishek has yet to make a big impact in the ICC event at home.After a duck in the opener, a stomach infection kept him out against Namibia. He returned for the high-stakes clash with Pakistan but again failed to score.Thankfully, Ishan Kishan’s imperious form at the other end has kept India’s campaign on track. To his credit, Abhishek’s high-risk approach has delivered multiple wins for India, and it may only be a matter of time before he dismantles top bowlers again. Yet, four ducks in his last six innings indicate he might need to rethink his powerplay strategy.With India already through to the Super 8s, the Netherlands game offers the perfect chance to get back among the runs. On the bowling front, India could rest a few players ahead of the next stage, including pace spearhead Jasprit Bumrah. After opting for Kuldeep Yadav over Arshdeep Singh in Colombo, the team is expected to revert to two specialist pacers.If Bumrah is rested, Mohammed Siraj and Arshdeep Singh are likely to open the attack.The India vs Netherlands match will be played on Wednesday, February 18.The match will be played at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad.The match will start at 7:00 PM IST, with the toss scheduled for 6:30 PM IST.The match will be televised live in India on the Star Sports Network.Live streaming will be available on the Jio Hotstar app and website.The match can be followed live on TimesofIndia.com.- Probable XI: Abhishek Sharma, Ishan Kishan, Tilak Varma, Suryakumar Yadav, Rinku Singh, Hardik Pandya, Shivam Dube, Axar Patel, Arshdeep Singh, Jasprit Bumrah, Varun Chakarvarthy- Probable XI: Michael Levitt, Max O'Dowd, Bas de Leede, Colin Ackermann, Scott Edwards, Zach Lion-Cachet, Roelof van der Merwe, Logan van Beek, Aryan Dutt, Paul van Meekeren, Fred Klaasen: Suryakumar Yadav (c), Abhishek Sharma, Tilak Varma, Sanju Samson, Shivam Dube, Ishan Kishan, Hardik Pandya, Arshdeep Singh, Jasprit Bumrah, Mohammed Siraj, Varun Chakaravarthy, Kuldeep Yadav, Axar Patel, Washington Sundar, Rinku Singh.: Scott Edwards (c), Colin Ackermann, Noah Croes, Bas de Leede, Aryan Dutt, Fred Klaassen, Kyle Klein, Michael Levitt, Zach Lion-Cachet, Max O'Dowd, Logan van Beek, Timm van der Gugten, Roelof van der Merwe, Paul van Meekeren, Saqib Zulfiqar.","India take on the Netherlands in their final T20 World Cup league match on Wednesday.

Refreshed and energised after the one-day break, players began descending the long staircase from the dressing room to the field around 5:30pm and immediately got to work. There were no absentees and everyone made their presence felt with bat, ball and the catching session under fielding coach T Dilip.What initially started as a hit on one practice pitch trickled down to the far end of the practice square where ground staff made late arrangements for range hitting. Even the practice cage toward the stadium's main enclosure was lit, hosting Kuldeep Yadav, Tilak Varma, and Mohammed Siraj working on their skills, with Jasprit Bumrah joining late. There was activity everywhere and it became difficult to keep a tab on multiple hot spots which were activated for the marathon yet high-intensity training session.After completing his usual release work with the resistance band and getting a feel for the main ground, Bumrah went to the nets with bowling coach Morne Morkel . The South African was asked to remove his boots which were precisely placed around the popping crease and Bumrah had his target locked. The bowler delivered a few looseners from a short run-up; once satisfied with the run-up and grip near the landing area, he bowled with full effort.It was a masterclass in accuracy as he repeatedly bowled to perfect his art of nailing yorkers at will and received constant feedback from the bowling coach. The two would break into short chats after almost every delivery and like a very patient learner, Bumrah soaked in the advice he received. Mohammed Siraj, still padded up, dropped by and the two had some nice banter before Bumrah resumed business. By the time he was done, Morkel's footwear was severely damaged as the ball thudded into the pair on many occasions but the coach wasn't complaining. It was a job well done, and attention returned to the main ground.​​The ring of fire was lit in its full glory and shouts of ""Watch out! Mind!"" reverberated in the empty stands as a barrage of sixes were launched by the India batters, Hardik Pandya in particular. The right-hander switched nets and partners but looked to go big almost every delivery. The onslaught began against the Indian squad's spinners, continued against the seamers, and concluded with the destruction of everything net bowlers and side-armers sent his way during the marathon two-hour hitting session.His teammates had to duck for cover and the handful of officials and media personnel watching the nets from the sight screen were constantly focused on the ball. This could well be India's last full-throttle hit before the Super 8s get underway and no player showed any drop in intensity during their time in the middle. From Sanju Samson, Ishan Kishan, Tilak, and Suryakumar Yadav to the bowlers Siraj, Kuldeep, and Varun Chakravarthy, and then the all-rounders —Axar Patel, Shivam Dube and Washington Sundar — they arrived fresh but left drenched in sweat after what seemed like a satisfying outing.As expected, initial attention was restricted to World No.1 T20I batter Abhishek Sharma , who is yet to get off the mark in the tournament. With three ducks in as many games, the youngster looked a bit low on confidence and his delayed entry into the batting net raised some eyebrows. It, however, was similar to what he had done on the eve of the match vs USA at Wankhede where he was one of the last players to have a hit. Similar to that pleasant evening in Mumbai, the left-hander first bowled an extended spell and then focussed only on hitting sixes in Ahmedabad on Friday. The connections however weren't as sweet and the baggage of three ducks did seem to weigh him down a bit.Before proceedings got underway, Coach Gautam Gambhir gave an extended pep talk. The fist bump between the two after their animated chat assured that management has his back. Bowling coach Morne Morkel echoed this sentiment at the press conference preceding the training.""Abhishek is a world-class player. Luckily, there were guys standing up with Abhishek obviously not scoring the runs he would like. But we're going through a very important phase of the World Cup now and I'm pretty sure he's going to deliver,"" said Morkel when asked about discussions around Abhishek in the Indian camp.""Not so much just for the team, but also for all the viewers watching the game, because he's entertaining and we love to see that. So, yeah, I'm pretty sure [he'll turn it around]; he's hitting the ball well in the nets. It's just a matter of getting that start and getting his innings going,"" the 41-year-old further added.​​Abhishek's nearly 20-minute hit had everyone glued to the net he was batting in. From coach Gautam Gambhir to captain Suryakumar Yadav and other support staff members, everyone watched the young lad who has had a forgettable T20 World Cup campaign so far. The way everyone grouped outside the nets explained what the left-hander's return to form means for the entire group, and how much they value his contributions and role in the side.With quality players, the question is always when, not how. There are very few doubts about their ability and it's that one sweet connection everyone waits for. The wait wasn't long as Abhishek managed to connect a few shots in his brief hit but the way he exited the net and stood near his training gear, he didn't look content. For a batter who has sent shivers down the opposition's spine, the struggle to return to form seemed real. It was also a reminder of how this sport unfolds and continues to be a great equaliser.Come Saturday, the belligerent southpaw will have another opportunity to hit the right notes, as the rest of the clan is expected to relax in the team hotel while only a few endure the afternoon heat.","India intensified their preparations for their Super Eight clash against South Africa with a rigorous four-hour training session in Ahmedabad on Friday evening. Players showcased high energy and focus across batting, bowling, and fielding drills. Jasprit Bumrah honed his yorkers and Hardik Pandya unleashing powerful sixes.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128634223,imgsize-122886,width-400,resizemode-4/128634223.jpg"

During the 2016 T20 World Cup, the then Netherlands captain Peter Borren, in one of the press conferences, was almost in tears and made an emotional plea to the International Cricket Council (ICC) to spend more on the Associates. “There is a sort of malaise towards Associate cricket. To grow further in the game, we always hear it is not commercially viable,” he had said.“Look at Indian television, highlights of us beating England are everywhere. Clearly, fans enjoy watching new teams succeed. So give us the opportunity. Let us compete, and let us be seen,” he had said, referring to the highlights of the Netherlands beating England in the 2009 T20 Cricket World Cup.Cut to the present, the noise is again getting louder, with Associates pushing Full Members to the edge, and it all started with the Netherlands again.Pakistan had slipped from 98/2 to 114/7 while chasing 148 against the Netherlands. Max O’Dowd dropped a catch in the penultimate over, and Faheem Ashraf became the hero with three sixes and two fours.India had a disastrous start against the USA and were reeling at 63/4 by the 10th over.Shubham Ranjane got down low but could not hold on to a Suryakumar Yadav catch. Surya went on to score a match-defining 84 off 49 balls.Having earlier reduced England to 57/3, Nepal eventually restricted them to 184/7. During the chase, they were 175/5, needing 10 runs off seven balls. Lokesh Bam was well set on 35 off 15 balls. Over the next four deliveries, Bam scored just three runs and England scraped through after a tight final over from Sam Curran.Scotland, who replaced Bangladesh, had England on the ropes as Tom Banton and Will Jacks occupied the crease in their chase of 153. Things had slowed to near run-a-ball over the previous three overs, and England now needed eight off the final six balls. Jacks then struck a six and a four to take them past the finish line.A couple of days later, England were 105/5 in the 13th over against Italy before eventually posting a strong 202. During the chase, Italy surged to 173/7 following 34 runs in two overs. Grant Stewart was set on 44 off 20 balls. The first-timers needed 30 off the last 12 deliveries. Sam Curran then removed Stewart, crushing their hopes.Not as dramatic perhaps, but Afghanistan got past the UAE in the final over, while the Netherlands pushed India despite looking down and out at one stage.Before the India vs Netherlands game, a broadcaster arrogantly parroted the pre-tournament claim that a 300-run total would be breached. Instead, the Men in Blue posted 193/6, restrained by Logan van Beek’s three-wicket haul.The eight Associate teams have made themselves count at this T20 World Cup and have not been the pushovers many expected them to be. The gap, as is repeated every two years, is reducing between the Associates and the Full Member nations.The reason for results going unfavourably for the Associates can be attributed quite simply to the lack of top-level opportunities and the inability to absorb pressure at key moments.“Until you play matches, you won’t be in those situations. No matter how much net practice you do, how do you come out of tight situations like 80/5? Or how do you win a match if you need 30 runs in the last two overs? You won’t feel it until you experience it on the ground,” said UAE coach Lalchand Rajput.“The more matches you play against good teams, the more situations you face. You might win only one out of five games, but it builds confidence that the next time you are in the same situation, you will be able to win,” he added.Namibia coach Craig Williams, too, didn't mince his words and has asked for more matches for the associates, if the ICC wants to make the sport global.""I think it's not rocket science. If you play more cricket, you're going to get better. And especially if you play more competitive cricket. So I think all the associate nations are calling out for the same thing. It's been a number of years since I was playing as well,"" he had said ahead of their last match against Pakistan in Colombo.Players, coaches and even administrators have urged the ICC to introduce more fixtures in the next Future Tours Programme.“There should be more matches, and definitely the ICC is working on it. That’s why this T20 World Cup has 20 teams. Hopefully, it will keep growing and more Associates will follow. If we qualify for the World Cup, we should get bigger chances to showcase ourselves,” Rajput said.Canada captain Saad Bin Zafar agreed. “If there is one thing I would like to change, it would be Associate countries getting more opportunities to compete against the best nations because that is the learning ground. That is where you learn,” he said after their loss to Afghanistan.Netherlands all-rounder Bas de Leede used the World Cup stage to remind everyone that his team has no cricket scheduled until June, with their next assignment being a World Cup qualifier.“We’ve shown the level Associate cricket is at right now. We can only ask for more opportunities against big teams because that is ultimately how we are going to improve as a collective,” said De Leede.The challenge of finding space in the calendar and the financial hurdles involved are not lost on those advocating for more matches.“The calendar doesn’t allow more matches with Full Members because Associate countries mostly play among themselves. It is also about TV rights, media and sponsorship, as everyone focuses on the top 10 teams. They have challenges as well. But this World Cup has shown that Associate countries are good enough to receive more funding and play more matches,” Rajput said.De Leede also offered a solution.“I understand the financial reasoning, but maybe a tri-nation series involving two Full Members could be an option. I recently saw a post about a European T20 series involving England, Scotland, Ireland, the Netherlands and Italy,” he said.“We saw how close Italy pushed England. There are a lot of options. Normally during the World Cup, it gets attention and then it fades away,” he added.History, though, does not look promising.After reaching the Super Eight stage and becoming one of the stories of the 2024 T20 World Cup, the USA did not play a single Full Member until this edition came around.The Netherlands, who reached the Super 12 of the 2022 T20 World Cup and shocked South Africa, did not play a single T20I between that day in Adelaide and a match against Nepal 479 days later in February 2024. Their only game against a Full Member in that period came against Ireland in the build-up to the 2024 edition.A major reason for improved performances, despite the lack of opportunities at the highest level, can be attributed to the growth of T20 leagues. More leagues mean more demand for players and more platforms for Associate cricketers to showcase their skills. USA wicketkeeper-batter Andries Gous underlined this with an unbeaten 120 for Desert Vipers against MI Emirates in the recently concluded ILT20.Curran, who helped keep two Associates at bay, acknowledged that more matches play a role. “The Associate nations are playing more often and getting much better. They are being exposed to better cricket and better grounds,” he said.UAE captain Muhammad Waseem, who plays for MI Emirates in the ILT20, shared dressing rooms with the likes of Rashid Khan, Chris Woakes, Kieron Pollard, Shakib Al Hasan, Jonny Bairstow and Nicholas Pooran ahead of the T20 World Cup.“We’ve learned to improve by playing alongside the best players in leagues. In the same way, if we play Test-playing nations, we will continue to get better. Then, in big tournaments, you will get even more competitive matches,” he told TimesofIndia.com.The presence of experienced heads in the dugout has helped as well.Stuart Law is the head coach of Nepal. Ian Harvey is the bowling consultant. Gary Kirsten is Namibia’s consultant. Rajput brings his wealth of experience from the Indian dressing room to the UAE. Duleep Mendis heads Oman, while Pubudu Dassanayake coaches the USA.Having done all they can on the field, the Associates can only hope they receive more opportunities before the next edition rolls around. Otherwise, the same conversations and pleas will be repeated in Australia and New Zealand.","The eight Associate teams have made themselves count at this T20 World Cup and have not been the pushovers many expected them to be. The gap, repeated every year, is reducing between the Associates and the Full Member nations.

Why Pakistan don't trust Babar Azam any more | T20 World Cup 2026

Pakistan dropped ace left-arm pacer Shaheen Afridi and demoted star batter Babar Azam against Namibia in a must-win game after facing heavy defeat against India in the T20 World Cup group-stage match, but the team's head coach, Mike Hesson on Friday rejected suggestions that changes were reactions to the heavy loss against India.Hesson said the decisions, including moving Babar Azam down the order and leaving out Shaheen Shah Afridi for the match against Namibia, were made for tactical reasons.India defeated Pakistan by 61 runs in the group-stage match, with Ishan Kishan leading the win with a major innings.Shaheen conceded 15 runs in his final over, while Babar scored five runs.""No, I wouldn't say that (Shaheen was dropped because of poor performance and Babar pushed down the order because of the loss to India). I think, as I said, (pacer) Salman Mirza deserved his opportunity,"" said Hesson in a media interaction.""And Babar was the first to recognise when left-arm spin was taking shape and it was turning that it wasn't a smart move to send out two right handers.""Babar did not bat against Namibia as Sahibzada Farhan scored an unbeaten century and carried the innings.""So no, certainly not a paradigm shift, (it was) more about roles,"" said Hesson, when asked if there was a ""paradigm shift"" after the defeat to India.Pakistan will next face New Zealand in their Super 8 opener in Colombo on Saturday. Improving their powerplay returns is a key focus.Hesson said Babar was moved from the opening position because his scoring rate in the powerplay has been below expectations.""Babar is well aware of that. I think he's well aware (his) strike rate in the powerplay in World Cups is less than 100 in T20s. So clearly, that's not a role that we think here we need. We think he's a fine player through the middle, if required, in terms of if we're in a little bit of trouble, or as we saw against the USA,"" said Hesson.""Once he gets himself set, he can increase his strike rate at that point. So, we brought Babar back in for a specific role post the Asia Cup. We wanted some batsmanship through the middle, and he certainly brings that for us.""Against Namibia, Shadab Khan was sent ahead of Babar. Farhan and Shadab batted through the full 20 overs.Hesson said Babar was not suited to come in around the 12th over when the team wanted to increase the scoring rate.""So, the other day we got to the 12th over mark and at that point, Babar Azam is not the best person to come in. We've got plenty of other options who can come in and perform that role towards the end. He knows that he's got a certain set of skills that the team require, and there are certain times where other players can perform that role more efficiently,"" added Hesson.",Pakistan dropped ace left-arm pacer Shaheen Afridi and demoted star batter Babar Azam.

How Suryakumar Yadav and Tilak Varma are hurting India | T20 World Cup

Former India cricketer Sanjay Bangar believes the India team have not fully lived up to expectations in the group stage of the ICC Men's T20 World Cup, but said the team’s best performance is still to come. He also pointed to one area that needs improvement before the Super Eight stage.India remained unbeaten in the group stage with wins over the United States, Namibia, Pakistan and the Netherlands However, the side showed difficulty against spin, batted cautiously in the middle overs and dropped chances in the field.Speaking on JioStar, Bangar said the team had made a steady start and had not dominated opponents, which meant they appeared slightly below their usual level.""However, the good thing is that their best is yet to come. Another positive aspect is that all the players have had a chance to feature in the playing XI, which augurs well in case there are any injury concerns later in the tournament. All the players are match-ready. If there is one department where they would want to improve, it would be catching, because we saw a few chances being dropped against Pakistan and the Netherlands,"" he added, as cited by news agency ANI.Bangar said that with limited runs from Abhishek Sharma, the world’s top-ranked T20I batter who is yet to score in three innings, Ishan Kishan has become crucial for India. Kishan has scored 176 runs in four matches at a strike rate of 202.29, including two fifties and a 40-ball 77 on a slow track against Pakistan in Colombo. He also highlighted Suryakumar Yadav and fast bowler Jasprit Bumrah as key players.""From here on, three players who are going to be extremely critical to India's journey in this T20 World Cup are the men in form. That's where I feel Ishan Kishan, given the way he has been batting and the lack of runs from Abhishek Sharma, becomes crucial. The onus is now on Ishan Kishan to provide those explosive starts. So, he is player number one. Player number two is Suryakumar Yadav. He has scored runs in most games on a consistent basis, while understanding the situation of the match. The third player is Jasprit Bumrah, because everybody is talking about the spin strength of this Indian team, but I believe Jasprit Bumrah will hold the key when the match is on the line, as far as bowling is concerned,"" he concluded.India have struggled against spin through the tournament. They lost three wickets for 42 runs in eight overs of spin against the USA, and five wickets for 61 runs against spin in eight overs against Namibia. Their run rates in those matches were 5.25 and 7.6. Namibia off-spinner Gerald Erasmus returned 4/20 in that game.Against Pakistan, 18 overs of spin were bowled, and India managed 144 for six against spin at a run rate of eight per over. Pakistan captain Salman Ali Agha dismissed Abhishek Sharma, while Saim Ayub and Usman Tariq kept things tight. India hit only two boundaries in four overs against Tariq.India’s best return against spin came against the Netherlands, scoring 70 runs in eight overs and losing two wickets at a run rate of 8.75.India will begin their Super Eight campaign against the South Africa in Ahmedabad on February 22. They will then face the unbeaten Zimbabwe in Chennai on February 26, before meeting the West Indies in Kolkata on March 1.","Former India cricketer Sanjay Bangar believes the team's best is yet to come.

PALLEKELE: Australian spinner Adam Zampa went past West Indies batting icon Chris Gayle, becoming the player with the second-highest 'Player of the Match' awards in the ICC T20 World Cup history.Zampa achieved this massive upward movement in tournament charts during his side's final group stage match against Oman at Pallekele. Aussies played with nothing to lose, for their pride, and Zampa's 4/21 in 3.2 overs was at the heart of their dominant performance.With this, Zampa has earned his sixth POTM in the T20 World Cup, overtaking Gayle, who had five. The player with the highest T20 WC POTM awards is Virat Kohli . The Indian icon has eight 'Player of the Match' awards and is the top run-getter in the tournament history, having earned these awards with some classic, clutch knocks coming during the biggest and most critical situations.Zampa surpassed Afghanistan spin superstar Rashid Khan to become the second-highest wicket-taker in the history of the ICC T20 World Cup.With this outing, Zampa now has 44 wickets in 25 T20 World Cup matches at an impressive average of 13.84. His tally includes one five-wicket haul and three four-wicket hauls to his name, and best figures of 5/19. He has overtaken Rashid, who took 43 scalps in 27 matches at an average of 15.30 and three four-wicket hauls to his name.The highest wicket-taker in T20WC history is Bangladesh legend Shakib al Hasan, who has 50 wickets at an average of 20.12 with three four-fers and best figures of 4/9.With his fourth four-wicket haul, he has also overtaken Shakib (three four-wicket hauls) for most four-fers in T20 WC history.Zampa ends his T20 WC campaign with eight wickets at an average of 14.50, with two four-fers to his name.Coming to the match, Australia won the toss and opted to bowl first. Wasim Ali (32 in 33 balls, with four boundaries) was the only batter to cross the 20-run mark as the rest of the batters barely offered any resistance against an Aussie attack wounded by an early exit from the tournament. The Aussies were out for blood, skittling out Oman for 104 in 16.2 overs, with Glenn Maxwell (2/13 in three overs), pacer Xavier Bartlett (2/27 in four overs) being amongst the thick of action. Marcus Stoinis and Nathan Ellis also got a wicket each.In the chase, skipper Mitchell Marsh (64* in 33 balls, with seven fours and four sixes) and Travis Head (32 in 19 balls, with six fours) bludgeoned the bowling attack, chasing down the target in 9.4 overs with nine wickets in hand.Australia end at the third place in their group, with two wins and two losses. After the match, Zampa reflected in his 'Player of the Match' speech that the group had endured ""really tough few days"" and felt really ""quiet and flat"" after their campaign fizzled out in the group stage itself with humiliating losses to Zimbabwe and Sri Lanka.""We genuinely felt we had built something over the last few years and had a clear brand of cricket we believed would stand up. Unfortunately, when the pressure came, it just did not work for us. So it is disappointing. I think that did happen a little bit. But looking back, I also feel I could have done more - particularly in that game where we were one for 110. You would expect a much bigger total than 180 from that position. My contribution in that match was not where I wanted it to be, and I am not happy with that,"" he said, reflecting on the match against Sri Lanka where he went wicketless for 41 runs in four overs while defending 182 runs.Zampa feels his execution has not been consistent enough and does not feel ""ready to be flying home tomorrow"".""As I said, players sitting on me definitely played a part, but from my point of view, I could have executed better, especially in the last game. My job is to take wickets through the middle overs. I managed to do that in a couple of games, but not consistently enough. We have built something over the last few years, and in big tournaments, everyone has to play their role. Unfortunately, when it mattered most, we could not quite get it done. You would always rather take wickets than not, but honestly, it is not really on my mind right now. I am pretty disappointed overall. I'm certainly not ready to be flying home tomorrow,"" he concluded.",Adam Zampa overtakes Chris Gayle as second-highest 'Player of the Match' in T20 World Cup history. Zampa takes 4/21 in 3.2 overs as Aussies beat Oman in Pallekele.

New Zealand hold intense nets before Super Eight match vs Pakistan | T20 World Cup

Australian captain Mitchell Marsh on Friday described the team's group-stage exit from the T20 World Cup as a ""missed opportunity"" but still believed he had the squad to go all the way in the tournament.Australia, one of the giants of limited-overs cricket with six ODI and one T20 World Cup title triumphs, failed to progress beyond the group stage in this edition of the T20 showpiece following defeats to Zimbabwe and Sri Lanka, but ended their campaign with a nine-wicket drubbing of Oman.""Probably just the sense of a missed opportunity,"" Marsh said when asked what's going on in his mind as the team leaves the tournament earlier than expected.At the presentation ceremony after the game against Oman, the skipper added, ""As I've said a few times, it's a bitterly disappointed change room. Like every team, we built towards this for two years.""Unfortunately, in a couple of key games, we just didn't play our best cricket - and that's tournament play. You lose a game like the one against Zimbabwe, and suddenly you're under pressure.""Credit to them, they played well, but we're a very disappointed group right now.""The tournament is being held jointly by India and Sri Lanka, and the conditions have been different in both countries. Marsh, however, refused to read much into the conditions as his team was grappling with injuries, poor form of players, and a few questionable selections.""I don't think conditions were the main issue. In Colombo, it was slow, but we had prepared for that. I still believe we had the squad to get the job done. But in tournament cricket, if you're even slightly off, you can lose a game that puts you on the back foot.""Over the last couple of weeks, there were good opportunities for us, but we just weren't able to deliver when it mattered most,"" Marsh said.Oman failed to win a single match in the tournament, and skipper Jatinder Singh said they will reflect on the preparation and performance, which was ""not up to the mark"".""It is a proud moment for all of us that we got a chance. The result and the journey, it did not go our way. Will reflect on the preparation, it was not quite up to the mark.He added, ""Could not get the full members' support.

Pep Guardiola 'couldn't care less' about Arsenal stumble in Premier League title race,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/epl/top-stories/pep-guardiola-couldnt-care-less-about-arsenal-stumble-in-premier-league-title-race/articleshow/128610937.cms,"Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola during a press conference in Manchester, England, Tuesday, Nov. 4, 2025, ahead of the Champions League soccer match against Borussia Dortmund. (AP)

LONDON: Pep Guardiola insists he ""couldn't care less"" about Arsenal's stumble letting Manchester City back into the Premier League title race.Guardiola's side were in danger of being blown away by Arsenal after their inconsistent form left the Gunners in pole position.But second-placed City have been handed a lifeline by Arsenal's damaging draws against Wolves and Brentford.They are now just five points behind Arsenal with a game in hand and a home match against Mikel Arteta's men to come in April.If City win their remaining 12 matches they will be crowned champions for the fifth time in the last six seasons.But Guardiola is not getting carried away by the opportunity.Instead, he remains focused on Saturday's visit from Newcastle, when a win would close the gap on Arsenal to two points before the Gunners face Tottenham in the north London derby on Sunday.""I didn't talk about the table, or our position or something like that. I could not care less,"" Guardiola told reporters on Friday.""I didn't talk about that for one second. Just Newcastle, Newcastle, Newcastle.""If you ask me this question with two or three games left, I will have your answer. It's 12 games left, it's an eternity.""Having won six titles during 10 years at City, Guardiola knows the final weeks of the season will bring more twists and turns.He also has experience of watching Arsenal let substantial leads slip away in the 2023 and 2024 title races, allowing City to snatch the trophy from their grasp.""Many things are going to happen until the end of the season. For now it is Newcastle, a rest and after it Leeds. It has always been like that,"" he said.""Seventy per cent of the players are new, so they don't have the experience to live these kinds of situations. An experience is to win tomorrow. It is only one.""Arsenal were nine points (ahead) when we had a game in hand, so whenever everybody is on the same games played then after that we will see the difference.""I understand you want to anticipate what is going to happen. That doesn't count. It is Newcastle, that is all.""Meanwhile, Guardiola said racism remains a problem for society to cure rather than just football.Real Madrid star Vinicius Junior claimed he was racially abused by Benfica winger Gianluca Prestianni during a Champions League tie this week.The match was paused in line with UEFA regulations after Vinicius alleged he was abused after celebrating scoring.""There is a lot of work still to do. It is in the society, it is not just in football. Racism is everywhere,"" Guardiola said.""You pretend that racism is just for the colour of the skin? How you behave is racism.""It's how you pretend you are better than the other one just for many reasons.""","Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola insists he ""couldn't care less"" about Arsenal's stumble.

On the eve of NorthEast United FC ’s Indian Super League (ISL) opener against East Bengal FC, head coach Juan Pedro Benali struck a deeply emotional yet clear-headed note, calling on fans to rally behind their teams while keeping the bigger picture of Indian football in mind.“It’s easy to criticise on social media. Buy the tickets to watch your team, be it NorthEast United FC, East Bengal FC or Kerala Blasters FC, make people feel that football is important,” he said, before adding, “Rather than sitting at home and criticising, not watching the games, come to the stadiums.”The 56-year-old Spaniard emphasised that even small acts of support can make a meaningful difference, urging fans to go the extra mile for their clubs and the sport.“We know it is a difficult moment, but support your team. Just for that Rs 100, Rs 200 or Rs 50 (match ticket price), it’s money. The sacrifice that you make by travelling to watch the game, be it 10, 20, 50, or 80 km, is a sacrifice. But when you make that sacrifice, you earn the right to criticise, and you can say, I helped my club,” Benali added.While acknowledging the frustrations surrounding Indian football, Benali made it clear that fans are fully entitled to express their views — but insisted that criticism should be matched with action.“The national team is not doing well, because of this, that… I understand. It’s your right (to voice your opinion). Do it, but also help. Rs 200 for each game. Go to the FanCode, pay Rs 299 for the season pass. Buy the subscription to watch NorthEast United FC (Team Pass). That’s what we’re asking from the fans. That’s the support. That’s the help. This is where the clubs can feel that they have (supporting) hands, and not the fans who only talk,” he said.In a call for unity during what he described as a challenging phase, Benali urged supporters to stand by their teams regardless of results or circumstances.“It is not a moment to say NorthEast will not do well or go to the second division. No, it is a moment to be with everyone, regardless of the results. Be with your team, your players,” he added.He signed off with a broader appeal, urging the entire Indian football ecosystem to come together as one.“This is the real moment to be a family. This is the real moment to be an Indian football family, all together. The clubs, the players, the fans. This is the moment to show the world that even if 10 per cent of the Indian population loves football, that’s 150 million people. But let’s be together,” Benali said.Dream Sports-owned FanCode is the official broadcaster of the ISL , having come onboard after a bid of Rs 8.62 crore.

The military will use two types of equipment:

A semi-mobile system that creates a protected zone where no unauthorized drone can fly.

A portable system that a soldier can carry and point at a suspicious drone.

The Mexican military is getting ready to deal with unauthorized drones during this summer’s football World Cup.Mexico is hosting the tournament together with the United States and Canada from June 11 to July 19. On Tuesday, soldiers at a military base in Mexico City showed the anti-drone equipment they plan to use to protect stadiums.The move comes because drug cartels in Mexico have increasingly used drones bought online to attack rivals and sometimes civilians. This has become more common over the past five years.However, most of the cartel violence happens far from the three World Cup host cities: Mexico City, Guadalajara, and Monterrey. These cities will host 13 matches during the tournament.""(Drone prevention) is going to be focused in the stadiums and where there are crowds, which could be the 'Fan Fest' events, or any point where there are meetings of people,"" army Captain Jose Alfredo Lara, a communications and electronics engineer, told AFP.Once the military team locates a drone, it cuts off the pilot's communication with the apparatus. ""The device loses control and won't be able to come close,"" Lara explained.This causes the drone to lose control and prevents it from getting close. Depending on how it is set up, the drone may return to its operator, try to leave the blocked area, or crash.Several major criminal groups in Mexico, including the Sinaloa Cartel, Cartel Jalisco Nueva Generacion, and La Familia Michoacana, are known to use drones. Their activity is mostly reported in states like Michoacan, Chihuahua, and Guanajuato.Last October, drones carrying homemade explosives attacked state prosecutor offices in Tijuana, a city near the US border.The Mexican military says these new security measures are meant to reduce the risk of drone attacks during the World Cup and keep fans safe.",Mexico is hosting the tournament together with the United States and Canada from June 11 to July 19.

Vinicius Junior scored the only goal as Real Madrid beat Benfica 1-0 away in Lisbon in the first leg of their Champions League play-off.However, the match was overshadowed by controversy. After scoring early in the second half with a powerful shot into the top corner, Vinicius celebrated by dancing in front of the home fans and was given a yellow card.Soon after, Benfica’s Gianluca Prestianni appeared to say something to him. Vinicius reported to the referee, Francois Letexier, that he had been called “mono” (Spanish for monkey). The game was stopped for several minutes, and Vinicius was later booed by the crowd.Benfica coach Jose Mourinho was sent off late in the game for protesting too strongly. This means he will miss the second leg in Madrid. Despite 12 minutes of added time, Benfica could not equalise and now face a tough task in the return match.""(What happened) is something that nobody likes, you have to ask the Benfica player what he said,"" Real coach Alvaro Arbeloa told broadcaster Movistar.""(Racism) is something we have to eradicate from the world of football and if the players don't fix it then this is very complicated.""In another match, Paris Saint-Germain came back from two goals down to beat AS Monaco 3-2.Folarin Balogun scored twice in the first 18 minutes to give Monaco a strong start.PSG missed a penalty through Vitinha, and Ousmane Dembele went off injured.But substitute Desire Doue changed the game.

Kolkata: Some wobbles, some worries and in the end Mohun Bagan Super Giant got just what the doctor ordered — a 2-0 win over Kerala Blasters to start their defence of the ISL title here on Saturday.Jamie Maclaren put Sergio Lobera’s side in front in the 36th minute and Tom Aldred came off the bench to head home the second goal to polish the victory up deep into injury time.However, it was not the kind of rise-and-shine moment the 30,000-odd fans present at the stands would love to be thrilled with.The defending champions’ path to victory was strewn with some avoidable potholes here and there, something which one might be tempted to attribute to their opening match rustiness and ineptitude.It was Petratos who had a direct role in breaking the deadlock. The Bagan No. 9, receiving the ball inside the box from Apuia, laid it off quickly for fellow Australian Maclaren, who steered clear of Aiban Dohling’s challenge with a sharp turn to beat the goalkeeper Sachin Suresh with a left-footed low volley. Bagan thereafter had more possession and more territory, but they couldn’t control the opponents, who looked more ambitious in the second half, especially with the arrival of Kevin Yoke.Sensing the problem, Lobera introduced Aldred in the 81st minute, taking off Petratos. Defender Aldred calmed the nerves for his team, rising to the occasion to meet Anirush Thapa’s free-kick and beating the Blasters goalkeeper for the second time. It also ensured a perfect start to the Lobera reign at the club as the Spaniard has now kept the record of a winning debut in the ISL for all four clubs he has managed so far.",Mohun Bagan Super Giant beat Kerala Blasters 2-0 in ISL opener.

Patrick Mahomes and family go all out with over-the-top Peppa Pig birthday celebration for daughter



Sterling’s 5th birthday turned into a private storybook scene for the family of Patrick Mahomes , who traded football routines for pink frosting and preschool joy. On Friday, the celebration unfolded behind closed gates at Peppa Pig Theme Park Dallas-Fort Worth, which was reserved entirely for the occasion. No crowds. No waiting. Just laughter echoing through empty walkways as Sterling and her loved ones enjoyed a world built around her favorite character.It was not about spectacle for the public eye. It was about presence. Mahomes and his wife, Brittany Mahomes, watched their daughter soak in every moment, joined by her younger brother Bronze and a small circle of family and friends. Some had traveled across states to be there. At the entrance, the family paused for a portrait, the kind that quietly captures time before it slips forward again.Sterling’s 5th birthday carried a simple idea executed in a rare way. The park was closed to the public so she could experience it freely, turning familiar rides into something personal. Clips shared later showed Sterling riding Grampy Rabbit’s Dinosaur Adventure with both parents beside her, smiling as they followed her lead rather than the other way around.The highlight came when Peppa Pig herself appeared. Sterling’s face lit up as she hugged the character she had watched so many times at home. Her cake followed the same theme, covered in pink and designed with the playful charm of Peppa’s world.The timing carried its own meaning. This offseason has looked different for Patrick as he works his way back from a torn ACL. Instead of stadium noise, his days have included family projects and quiet milestones. Friday fit that shift. It was not about recovery schedules. It was about being present for a memory his daughter will carry.Sterling has been part of her father’s football life from the start. Born on Feb. 20, 2021, she has often been seen on sidelines in outfits stitched with personal touches. Brittany once described those moments to PEOPLE, saying, ""She truly enjoys going down to the field and getting to see him before the game. I think it's a very special moment wherever I get to bring them to the game and they get to watch their dad play football. ""Birthdays have long been emotional markers for Brittany too.

A recent poll shows BTS leading by a wide margin, with BLACKPINK and Taylor Swift also in contention. Swift has hinted she would not perform while Travis Kelce is still playing. The early results highlight the NFL’s growing global reach and shifting musical influence.

BTS surge ahead in early fan voting for Super Bowl LXI

Taylor Swift remains a perennial favorite

It's only been a few days since Bad Bunny's historic Super Bowl halftime show, but people are already talking about who will headline the 2027 show. Fans are excited to see which global superstar could match the size and cultural impact of this year's show. The next championship game will be on February 14, 2027, at SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, California.Early reports say that the talk is no longer just about American pop stars. International acts and crossover megastars are winning fan polls and industry talk, showing how the halftime show has become a global cultural event instead of just a U.S. event.According to discussion highlighted on Billboard’s Pop Shop Podcast, BTS currently lead fan voting by a massive margin, capturing more than 85 percent of the vote in a recent poll. The group’s reunion and anticipated comeback album, Arirang, along with a global tour expected in the coming months, have strengthened expectations that the K-pop superstars could take the Super Bowl stage next.Their dominance in the poll shows that the NFL's audience is growing around the world and that the league is interested in artists who can get attention all over the world. BLACKPINK also got 3.67 percent of the vote, which shows how popular K-pop acts are around the world.BTS are more than just numbers, they are a rare mix of stadium-scale performance power and cross-cultural reach. A halftime show would be another step forward for the NFL in its goal to reach more people around the world.Despite the K-pop wave, Taylor Swift continues to surface in Super Bowl halftime discussions each year. She received 2.01 percent of the vote and remains one of the most commercially successful and culturally influential artists in the world.However, Swift has previously suggested she would avoid headlining while Travis Kelce remains an active NFL player. During an appearance with Jimmy Fallon, she joked, “Can you imagine that he’s out there every single week, like, putting his life on the line, doing this very dangerous, very high-pressure, high-intensity sport, and I’m like, ‘I wonder what my choreo should be?’""Other names circulating among fans include Post Malone, Miley Cyrus, Justin Bieber, Harry Styles, Drake, Lil Wayne, and Jay-Z. Still, the early surge behind BTS signals a shifting global influence over one of America’s most-watched cultural moments.As anticipation builds, one thing remains certain: the Super Bowl halftime show is no longer just a performance. It is a global statement.","Fan buzz for the 2027 Super Bowl halftime show is already growing after Bad Bunny’s historic performance.

Jordon Hudson's viral outfit revives past NFL controversy

Fan backlash puts Bill Belichick in uncomfortable spotlight

Early February delivered an unexpected viral moment involving former New England Patriots coach Bill Belichick, but it had nothing to do with playbooks or championships. Instead, attention shifted to his girlfriend, Jordon Hudson, whose outfit at a college basketball rivalry game quickly ignited online debate and revived old controversies tied to the NFL’s past.Photos of Hudson at the Duke vs. North Carolina game spread rapidly across social media, prompting strong reactions from fans and critics. What might have been a routine appearance instead became a flashpoint, drawing Belichick back into public scrutiny months after his Patriots tenure ended.Jordon Hudson, 24, attended the rivalry matchup wearing a T-shirt referencing Orchids of Asia Day Spa, the Florida business linked to Patriots owner Robert Kraft’s widely reported 2019 legal scandal. Many observers interpreted the shirt as a pointed jab, particularly given the timing around Super Bowl weekend.Belichick’s legacy with New England remains deeply tied to Kraft. The coach led the franchise to six Super Bowl victories before parting ways with the team after the 2023 season. That history made the shirt’s perceived message feel more charged to longtime fans.As images spread, criticism escalated. Social media users questioned Hudson’s judgment and, in some cases, urged Bill Belichick to distance himself from the controversy.“I can’t imagine Bill approving this but he must have. Unhinged,” one fan wrote. “He needs to end this,” another added. “Break up with her already, man,” one commenter posted. Another wrote, ""Does Jordon know she’s a pro*****te too?""Others broadened their criticism, suggesting the moment reflected poorly on Belichick himself. “This says everything about Bill, way more than Jordon. Pretty childish,” one user wrote.The backlash was an example of how swiftly the off field activities can create a perception of something in the eyes of the people even on the coach who was renowned on his discipline and control. In the case of Belichick, the viral episode served as a reminder, which he had not anticipated to be, that the image of the people goes beyond the sidelines.Months after, it is still a subject of discussion in NFL circles, underscoring the nexus of sports and celebrity culture and scrutiny of the internet. Even a wardrobe decision can have long-term effects in a time when one photo can have a headline.","Jordon Hudson wore a shirt referencing the Orchids of Asia Day Spa scandal to a UNC–Duke game.

Is Cam Skattebo retiring already? Viral social media buzz sparks confusion and concern among college football fans,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/is-cam-skattebo-retiring-already-viral-social-media-buzz-sparks-confusion-and-concern-among-college-football-fans/articleshow/128628920.cms,"Cam Skattebo retirement rumor (Getty Images)

Cam Skattebo retiring rumor explained: how it started, why it spread, and what’s actually true



Cam Skattebo retiring became a sudden talking point this week, and it caught many New York Giants fans off guard. The rookie running back had already endured a painful setback after a frightening ankle injury cut short what looked like a special debut season. So when social media began whispering about his future, concern spread quickly. For a player who had given the offense fresh life, the timing felt cruel and confusing.The truth, though, is far less dramatic than the rumor mill suggested. The speculation did not come from the locker room or the team. It came from a parody account online. And while the post traveled fast, it carried no weight. Skattebo’s focus remains on healing, not walking away.The rumor began after a fake post circulated on X, claiming Skattebo was thinking about quitting football. The account even presented it as if the rookie had said it himself on stream. But a closer look revealed the truth. Right in the account’s bio was the word ""parody,"" making its intent clear. Despite how real it looked, it was fiction. As has since been clarified, ""No, Skattebo is not retiring."" Another reminder followed soon after.""It's not, though. Skattebo isn't going anywhere.""That reassurance matters, especially considering what Skattebo has just been through. In Week 8 against the Philadelphia Eagles, he suffered a severe ankle dislocation while trying to haul in a pass from fellow rookie Jaxson Dart. Linebacker Zach Baun brought him down, and the way Skattebo’s leg twisted told the story instantly. His season was over. The recovery process tested him both physically and mentally, and he admitted it led him into dark moments.Before that injury, his impact was undeniable. Selected in the fourth round of the 2025 NFL Draft, he wasted no time proving his value. In just eight games, he ran for 410 yards, added 207 receiving yards, and reached the end zone seven times. Those numbers hinted at something bigger. Had he stayed healthy, Rookie of the Year conversations would not have been out of place.More than stats, it was his energy. He gave the Giants balance. He gave fans hope. His partnership with Dart showed flashes of what could define the team’s future.For now, the priority is simple. Heal. Return. Pick up where he left off. The rumor may have caused a stir, but inside the Giants’ building, nothing has changed. Skattebo’s story is still just beginning.","New York Giants rookie running back Cam Skattebo was rumored to be retiring. The rumor spread quickly after a parody account posted it online.

Camille Kostek and Rob Gronkowski’s birthday post shows why their decade-long bond still thrives



Camille Kostek woke up to a wave of birthday love on Feb. 19, but one message carried a little more weight than the rest. The model’s Instagram filled quickly, yet it was her longtime partner Rob Gronkowski who drew the most attention. His post was simple, warm, and unmistakably personal, a reminder that their bond still sits at the center of their public lives.He marked the day with five photos, each offering a relaxed look at their life together. The smiles were easy. The setting felt natural. After more than a decade together, nothing about their connection looked forced. It looked lived in.Gronkowski’s tribute appeared on Instagram the same day, celebrating Kostek with a carousel of moments from their relationship. “Happy Birthday my Love! ❤️❤️,” he wrote. The images ranged from coordinated pastel outfits to a quiet solo shot of Kostek posing on a moving boat. Fans quickly filled the comments, drawn to a black and white photo where she laughed on his back. One user wrote, “It’s the last pic for me 🦋.”Their story traces back to 2013, when he played for the New England Patriots and she cheered on the sidelines. They met at a charity event and stayed in touch.Over time, their connection grew into something steady, even as Gronkowski built a Hall of Fame career that included titles with New England and later the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.He reflected on that journey earlier this year in an interview with The New York Post. “There has been a lot of success in that decade, and it just keeps continuing,” he said. He offered a glimpse into their routine as partners, adding, “We’re going to keep continuing that success and just keep working together. We help each other out, we get together and share each other’s schedules and we manage it with perfection, especially sharing a dog [Ralphie, a French bulldog] as well, which is the joy of our lives, too. ”Kostek has built her own career, rising as a prominent face of Sports Illustrated Swimsuit and expanding her presence in fashion and media. She told PEOPLE that one dream still sits on their list. “Rob does so many professional shoots, I do so many professional shoots, but we never shot anything together, so we’re looking to shoot a cover together.”Their relationship has not been without pressure. Speaking on Honestly Cavallari: The Headline Tour hosted by Kristin Cavallari, Kostek shared how outsiders judged their timeline. “I felt like I was seen as a lesser-than girlfriend because I didn’t have a ring on my finger,” she said. She later reflected on their early years and a breakup that reshaped her focus. “Rob and I met when I was 21 years old, and we’ve been in each other’s lives for 10 years,” she said. “First breakup was in 2017, but I think that some of the best things that changed the trajectory of my life came from this (expletive) breakup that broke me but also allowed me to get in the zone. I didn’t care about dating. I felt like I was asexual.""Those moments now sit behind them. What remains is visible in the photos. Familiar. Unpolished.

Former UConn captain Keith Gray convicted on nine federal charges in $328 million Medicare fraud and money laundering case

Former NFL player Keith Gray has been found guilty in a massive $328 million Medicare fraud case. A federal jury convicted the ex-University of Connecticut football captain on nine criminal counts this week. According to the U.S. Department of Justice, prosecutors proved that Keith Gray helped run a scheme that billed Medicare for genetic tests that patients did not need.The government said those tests were supposed to check the risk of heart disease and other conditions. But investigators told the court there was no medical reason for most of them. Even so, Medicare was billed hundreds of millions of dollars. Court records show the total amount charged was about $328 million. From that, Medicare paid out roughly $54 million. Now, Keith Gray is facing serious prison time. Each count carries up to 10 years in prison. His sentencing date will be announced later.The U.S. Department of Justice announced the verdict on Friday. Prosecutors described Keith Gray as a key figure in organizing the fraud. They said he worked with others to arrange genetic testing for Medicare patients, even when doctors had not properly approved or requested those tests.During the trial, prosecutors explained that the scheme also involved illegal kickbacks. The jury convicted Keith Gray of conspiracy to defraud the United States, conspiracy to pay and receive health care kickbacks, five counts of violating the Anti-Kickback Statute, and three counts of money laundering.Federal officials also told the court that some of the Medicare payments were used to buy luxury vehicles. According to evidence presented, Keith Gray purchased a Mercedes-Benz SUV valued at more than $154,000 and a Dodge Ram truck worth more than $142,000. Prosecutors said these purchases were part of efforts to move and spend the fraud proceeds.Before this case, Keith Gray was known for football. He started all 13 games at center for the University of Connecticut in 2007 and served as team captain. In 2009, he signed with the Carolina Panthers as an undrafted free agent. He was later released and spent time with the Indianapolis Colts practice squad.After short stints in professional football, including time in the United Football League, he moved on from the sport. Now, instead of football headlines, Keith Gray is waiting for sentencing in federal court, where he could face decades behind bars.","Keith Gray was found guilty of conspiracy to defraud the United States, conspiracy to pay and receive health care kickbacks, five counts of violating the Anti-Kickback Statute, and three counts of money laundering.

Myles Garrett’s Super Bowl goal meets Cleveland Browns reality as Chloe Kim hints at life change

Myles Garrett is locked in with the Cleveland Browns on paper, but people still keep asking the same question, does he see his long-term future there? The star defensive end signed a record deal that made him the highest-paid defensive player in NFL history. That contract ties him to the Browns, and trade options are limited because of its structure.Still, Garrett recently looked Micah Parsons in the eye and said he wants to win a Super Bowl and be Super Bowl MVP. That comment sparked fresh talk about whether he truly believes that can happen in Cleveland. At the same time, his girlfriend, Olympic snowboarder Chloe Kim, is facing big decisions of her own after another Winter Games appearance. So while rumors swirl around football, Garrett’s personal life is also moving forward.Garrett has spent nine seasons with the Cleveland Browns. In that time, he has played in only three playoff games. The team has struggled for consistency, especially at quarterback.Even after Garrett recorded 23 sacks in a single season one of the best marks in recent years, the Browns won just five games.His contract makes a trade very difficult in the short term.Still, some believe the Dallas Cowboys should try. Garrett grew up in Arlington, Texas, and has spoken in the past about being a Cowboys fan.On FS1’s First Things First, analyst Willie Colon made his view clear. He said, “If I’m the Cowboys, you sell your soul, and you go get Myles Garrett.” Colon added, “Whatever I got to do, get Myles Garrett in the building.”At the moment, though, there is no confirmed trade request. Garrett remains under contract, and the Browns have given no public sign that they plan to move him.Away from football, Garrett has been supporting Chloe Kim. Kim recently competed at the Winter Olympics and won a silver medal in the halfpipe, finishing behind South Korea’s Choi Gaon.After the event, she spoke honestly about her future. In an interview with Sports Illustrated, Kim said, “I’d love to start a family. My mom had me when she was young. I’d love to be a young mom. My dad’s 70 right now. There’s so much time, but also not enough time.”Those words show she is thinking beyond competition. Garrett, meanwhile, continues training while balancing personal time. For now, his goal remains clear, he wants a championship. Whether that happens in Cleveland is still the big question.","Myles Garrett is locked in with the Cleveland Browns on paper, but does he see his long-term future there?

Jordon Hudson and Bill Belichick continue drawing attention amid New England Patriots buzz

Jordon Hudson found herself at the center of social media chatter early Friday after replying to a New England Patriots fan on X. The fan, whose username shows strong support for quarterback Drake Maye, made a bold promise. He said he would get Hudson’s face tattooed on his backside if the Patriots failed to win the Super Bowl next season. Hudson did not ignore it. She replied with five simple words: “I’ll hold you to it.”Her short message quickly grabbed attention. Many fans took it as a sign that she does not expect the Patriots to lift the trophy next season. The exchange spread fast online, adding another headline to what has already been an eventful year around Bill Belichick and Hudson.Jordon Hudson has been dating former New England Patriots head coach Bill Belichick since around 2023. The couple first appeared publicly together in 2024. Since then, Hudson’s online presence and public appearances have often sparked conversation.This latest moment came just from a simple reply on X. A Patriots supporter promised a dramatic tattoo if the team did not win it all. Hudson answered, “I’ll hold you to it.”That short line was enough to light up timelines.This is not the first time Hudson has made headlines. Before the Patriots faced the Seattle Seahawks in Super Bowl XLIX, Belichick and Hudson attended a North Carolina vs. Duke basketball game.Hudson wore a shirt that referenced “Orchids of Asia Day Spa,” the Florida spa connected to a past investigation involving Patriots owner Robert Kraft. Sports commentator Skip Bayless later criticized that move on his YouTube show.He said, “It was snarky, petty, and it was really low blow. It is the lowest form of a cheap shot.” His wife, Ernestine, added, “She’s controlling his life.” Bayless also said, “He embarrassed the school through her.”For context, charges against Robert Kraft were later dropped after courts ruled that the surveillance used in the case was unconstitutional. Kraft has continued to maintain his innocence.As for the Patriots, the team is building around young quarterback Drake Maye and looking toward the future. Whether they become Super Bowl contenders next season remains to be seen. But one thing is clear, when Jordon Hudson speaks, even in just a few words, people pay attention.","Jordon Hudson responded to a New England Patriots fan on X.

Andy Reid and Travis Kelce stay in contact as Kansas City Chiefs face key offseason decisions

Kansas City Chiefs fans are waiting on one big answer right now, will Travis Kelce return next season or walk away from football? Head coach Andy Reid finally addressed the situation and made one thing clear: the lines of communication are still open. That alone says a lot. Kelce, who is 36 years old, is thinking about his next move as free agency approaches in March.He is set to become an unrestricted free agent, which means he would need a new contract to stay in Kansas City. Even with retirement rumors growing, Reid sounded calm when he spoke to reporters on Friday. The message was simple. Nothing is decided yet, but conversations are happening. For a player who has meant so much to the Chiefs over the years, this decision feels bigger than just another offseason story.Andy Reid did not try to guess what Travis Kelce will choose. Instead, he focused on what is happening behind the scenes. “I’ve said this before, as long as there’s communication, I’m good,” Reid said Friday.“That means people want to move forward, and that’s where I think Travis is. I’m not trying to put words in his mouth at all, and I try to give him some space. He’s been doing this a long time. He can sort all that out as he goes forward, but we’re proceeding with that, and there is communication.”That statement matters. When a coach speaks that openly, it usually means the relationship is strong. Last season, Travis Kelce still produced solid numbers.He finished with 76 catches for 851 yards and five touchdowns. While those numbers were slightly lower than his peak seasons, he remained one of the top tight ends in the league. He ranked fourth among tight ends in receiving yards.Now the bigger question is motivation. Kelce has already built a Hall of Fame career. He has Super Bowl rings. He has records. If he returns, it likely will not be about personal stats. It will be about competing for another championship.The Chiefs are entering an important offseason. Patrick Mahomes recently restructured his contract to create cap space, showing that the team still wants to compete at the highest level. That kind of move could influence Kelce’s thinking.At this stage of his career, Travis Kelce is not rushing. Andy Reid’s words show patience. The decision will come when Kelce feels ready. Until then, the Kansas City Chiefs and their fans wait.",Travis Kelce is set to become an unrestricted free agent in March. Head coach Andy Reid said the lines of communication are still open.

Kansas City Chiefs wide receiver Rashee Rice is one of the NFL’s young offensive talents since entering the league in 2023. His on-field impact during his rookie season, including a key role in Kansas City’s Super Bowl run, helped boost both his reputation and financial profile.He is still on his rookie deal, and although his salary may not seem like much by NFL standards, his early performance, endorsements, and long-term potential suggest that his financial condition might change a lot in the next few years.Rashee Rice’s net worth is estimated to be between $2-3 million as of 2026. This figure includes his NFL salary, signing bonus, and endorsement income. His net worth is still rather low compared to established receivers because he's just been in the league for a few seasons. However, analysts think it will go up if he keeps playing well.Rice signed a four-year rookie contract worth roughly $6.5 million after being selected in the second round of the 2023 NFL Draft. The deal included about $3.5 million guaranteed and a signing bonus of approximately $1.7 million.His salary follows the typical rookie structure, increasing each year:If Rice remains on the roster through the end of the deal, his total earnings will approach the full contract value.So far Rice has earned close to $4.8 million in NFL income (including his signing bonus and yearly salaries). Endorsement partnerships have also contributed to his income, though they are still developing compared to veteran stars.He has worked with brands such as Adidas, Panini, and several lifestyle and sports companies. He has also built his personal brand through partnerships in Texas and Kansas City. Promotions on social media and deals on trading cards have brought in tiny but constant amounts of money.Rice's second deal will have a big impact on his long-term financial prospects. Wide receivers who do well sometimes get extensions worth $40 to $60 million or more, which could make his net worth go up a lot.Still early in his career, Rashee Rice’s earnings story is only beginning. If he stays productive and avoids setbacks, the Chiefs receiver could soon move from rookie-level income to the NFL’s top pay tier.","Rashee Rice's net worth is estimated to be between $2-3 million as of 2026.

Champions Trophy: Rohit Sharma back to his belligerent best in final training session

England’s final blow in the tournament

Can India overcome New Zealand in the ICC Champions Trophy?

India vs New Zealand

: A high-stakes final group clash

The Champions Trophy semi-final picture is almost complete, with South Africa sealing their spot on Saturday with a commanding seven-wicket win over England in Karachi. Wiaan Mulder (3-25) and Marco Jansen (3-39) dismantled England's batting lineup, bundling them out for a meager 179 in 38.2 overs. South Africa then chased the target comfortably, losing just three wickets in 29.1 overs.This victory secured South Africa's place at the top of Group B with five points, one ahead of Australia, meaning both teams progressed to the semi-finals. Meanwhile, from Group A, India and New Zealand have already qualified, with their final group match on Sunday set to determine the semi-final fixtures.For England, the tournament has been a disaster, suffering three defeats — including losses to Australia and Afghanistan — before their elimination was confirmed with a game to spare. Adding to their woes, Jos Buttler stepped down as captain following their exit.The final group-stage encounter between India and New Zealand will determine the final semi-final pairings. The first semi-final is scheduled for Dubai on March 4, while the second will take place in Lahore on March 5.Due to political tensions, India have played all their matches in Dubai and will continue to do so in the semi-finals, regardless of their group position. If India reach the final, it will be held in Dubai on March 9; otherwise, Lahore will host the title decider.Fast bowler Jofra Archer provided an early spark for England, dismissing Tristan Stubbs (0) and Ryan Rickelton (27) at 47/2. However, a match-winning 127-run stand between Rassie van der Dussen and Heinrich Klaasen sealed England’s fate. Klaasen struck 64 off 56 balls before falling to Adil Rashid, while van der Dussen remained unbeaten on 72. David Miller finished the game in style with a six.Earlier, Mulder and Jansen ripped through England’s top order, with spinner Keshav Maharaj (2-35) adding to their struggles. Joe Root top-scored for England with 37, highlighting their disappointing campaign.A seemingly invincible India will look to fine-tune their game against spin and test their bench strength when they face New Zealand in their last group match on Sunday. A win would secure them the top spot in Group A, though their semi-final opposition — either Australia or South Africa — will be tough regardless.Indian batters have struggled against spin in the tournament so far, adopting a cautious approach against Bangladesh’s Mehidy Hasan Miraz and Rishad Hossain, as well as Pakistan’s Abrar Ahmed. However, against New Zealand, they will face even trickier opposition in Mitchell Santner and Michael Bracewell, who have been in fine form on the slow Dubai surface.With 20 overs of high-quality spin expected from Santner, Bracewell and Glenn Phillips, the Indian batting lineup — led by Rohit Sharma , Shubman Gill, Virat Kohli , Shreyas Iyer and KL Rahul — will face a crucial test before the knockouts. The Indian team still has fresh memories of their 0-3 Test series defeat to New Zealand last year, where Santner and Phillips played a pivotal role.Beyond this match, the slowing nature of the Dubai pitch will be a key factor as the tournament heads into the knockout stage, making spin an even bigger weapon in the semi-finals and final.","South Africa sealed their place in the semi-finals with a seven-wicket win over England in Karachi on Saturday.

Can India overcome New Zealand in the ICC Champions Trophy?

The Australian cricket team has already departed for Dubai, while South Africa are set to leave late Saturday night or early Sunday morning, ahead of the Champions Trophy semifinals. However, uncertainty looms over whether their matches will actually be held there.Dubai is scheduled to host the first semifinal on Tuesday, while Lahore is set to host the second on Wednesday. The semifinal lineup remains undecided, with India's opponent — either Australia or South Africa — set to be confirmed only after India's last Group A match against New Zealand in Dubai on Sunday. India have played all their matches in Dubai, giving them a potential advantage over traveling teams.A source familiar with the developments told PTI that Australia departed for Dubai. The decision was made following their match against Afghanistan, which was abandoned due to rain on Friday night in Lahore.A BBC report earlier suggested that both Australia and South Africa sought to reach Dubai early to maximize training time if they were to face India in Tuesday’s semifinal.""Group B concludes with South Africa's match against England on Saturday, but neither the Proteas nor Australia will know their semifinal venue until after India’s match against New Zealand on Sunday,"" the report noted.""Were they (Australia and South Africa) to wait until Monday and only travel when the fixtures were confirmed, that would rule out the possibility of training in Dubai, where India will have played all three group matches,"" it added.The BBC report also highlighted a possible scenario where Australia and South Africa might have to return to Pakistan within 24 hours of leaving, depending on the final standings.As per the tournament format, the team finishing second in Group A will face the winners of Group B, and vice versa. Regardless of their final position in the group, India are assured of playing their semifinal in Dubai on Tuesday.","Australian cricket team has already departed for Dubai.

DUBAI: Thanks to the schedule, India have taken a largely unnecessary week’s break between their first and second match. Now, they have just a day's turnaround between their last league match and the first semifinal, leaving the team with a slight worry regarding the recovery of their bowlers, especially pacemen.Much of this haphazard scheduling owes itself to the hybrid model, with the event being staged across India and Pakistan. During India's practice session on Friday, assistant coach Ryan ten Doeschate highlighted the need to keep the team's bowlers fresh going into the business end of the tournament.Assured of a semifinal spot, India will have to ensure their top players are well-rested, while at the same time, not game-starved. India must also top the pool to avoid Australia.""We've had two pretty tough training sessions, so that's been the preparation. In terms of bench strength, I think the priority is making sure that we have our best guys available and fully fit for the second game (the semifinal on March 4). But we also don't want to rest them for another two days either.""So, to get that balance right, we might just try to share the bowling out a little bit. We obviously want to win against New Zealand as well. It's important that we keep that momentum going and top the group. The balance of those things has to be thought about,"" ten Doeschate said.Doeschate hinted at the possibility of India's bowlers not bowling their quota of 10 overs on Sunday as a way to preserve them for Tuesday's semifinal. ""They've had a lot of rest but it's how you back the two games up. If the seamers are going to bowl 10 overs, and then say we bowl second in the first game, and 36 hours later we're bowling first, that's quite a workload,"" he said.",India have taken a largely unnecessary week’s break between their first and second match.

Champions Trophy: Rohit Sharma back to his belligerent best in final training session

England’s head coach Brendon McCullum addressed their Champions Trophy campaign, which ended without a win, including a seven-wicket defeat to South Africa on Saturday. Despite the team's seventh consecutive ODI loss, their longest run of defeats since 2000/2001, McCullum maintained that their prior losses in India hadn't affected team morale.England suffered defeats in both T20 and ODI series in India before the ICC event.""No, I felt India was a very good preparation for such a tournament. Yes we were beaten comfortably by India but it was good preparation for a major tournament,"" McCullum stated at a press conference.He admitted that whilst the team had high expectations for the Champions Trophy, their performance fell short of expectations.""But we were very poor and it is very disappointing. But we saw tonight that we couldn't withstand the pressure and players lacked confidence,"" he observed.The coach highlighted the substantial work ahead, particularly in building player confidence before matches.""Give me a couple of weeks. I will be meeting with Rob Key and ECB officials to find out the best way forward and make sure we can see improvement in white ball cricket and we are very thorough about it.""Regarding leadership positions, McCullum indicated he would provide clarity about T20 and ODI captaincy appointments in the coming weeks. Jos Buttler's ODI captaincy concluded disappointingly, following his resignation after England's loss to Afghanistan.McCullum remarked: ""It is natural how he is feeling as he cares so much and is sad he couldn't get the best out of the guys. But it gives us an opportunity to move forward and find ways to do well as per the style of cricket we play. Jos remains a big player for us.""He emphasised that younger players such as Harry Brook and Jamie Smith should learn from this tournament whilst maintaining their confidence.""My main concern is to ensure no negativity bleeds into our big Test cricket summer and at same time ensure guys who have been successful before their confidence levels remain high.""McCullum acknowledged their strategy of favouring batsmen and fast bowlers might have been incorrect, despite having conviction in their plans.""Look we have to learn hard lessons from here and in the next few weeks I have confidence we will work it out because of the talent we have in English cricket not just here but otherwise also.""","England's head coach Brendon McCullum addressed their Champions Trophy campaign, which ended without a win.

Mateta hospitalised in Palace win

Bournemouth edge Wolves in penalty shootout; Preston shock Burnley

Manchester City overcame a first-half scare to defeat Plymouth Argyle 3-1 at the Etihad on Saturday, securing their place in the FA Cup quarter-finals. Meanwhile, Crystal Palace advanced with a 3-1 victory over Millwall, but the match was overshadowed by a serious injury to striker Jean-Philippe Mateta.Plymouth, who stunned Premier League leaders Liverpool in the previous round, looked set for another shock when Maksym Talovierov’s 38th-minute header put the Championship side ahead.Argyle boss Miron Muslic had called the opportunity to face Pep Guardiola the ""biggest honour"" of his career, and his side nearly delivered a dream result. However, City's 19-year-old midfielder Nico O'Reilly stole the spotlight, scoring twice from set-pieces to turn the tie around.O'Reilly’s first goal just before half-time settled City's nerves, before he powered in Phil Foden's corner 14 minutes from time. Star striker Erling Haaland, who started on the bench, came on late and assisted Kevin De Bruyne for City’s third goal in stoppage time.Crystal Palace’s derby victory over Millwall was marred by a horrifying injury to Mateta, who was stretchered off after being accidentally kicked in the head by Millwall goalkeeper Liam Roberts just eight minutes into the match.Roberts, who initially won the ball, caught Mateta with his boot while clearing outside the penalty area. After a VAR review, referee Michael Oliver upgraded his initial decision to a red card.Palace manager Oliver Glasner was furious, stating the tackle could have ended Mateta's career. ""Just imagine if he hits his face straight, with his power, with the studs, it is the end of JP's career,"" he said.Mateta later reassured fans on Instagram: ""Thank you for all your kind messages. I'm doing well. I hope to be back very soon. And stronger than ever.""Palace capitalised on their numerical advantage, with Japhet Tanganga’s own goal opening the scoring in the 33rd minute. Daniel Muñoz doubled the lead before Millwall’s Wes Harding pulled one back in first-half stoppage time. Eddie Nketiah sealed the win for Palace with a late looping header.Bournemouth reached the quarter-finals for only the third time in their history after a dramatic 5-4 penalty shootout win over Wolves following a 1-1 draw.Evanilson’s first-half strike was followed by VAR controversy when Milos Kerkez had a goal ruled out for offside after an eight-minute review, due to a failure of the semi-automated system.Matheus Cunha equalised with a stunning strike for Wolves but was later sent off for violent conduct after clashing with Kerkez. In the shootout, Luis Sinisterra converted the winning penalty after Wolves' Boubacar Traoré hit the crossbar.Preston North End ended Burnley’s 23-game unbeaten run with a dominant 3-0 victory at Deepdale. Milutin Osmajic, who was previously accused of racist abuse by Burnley’s Hannibal Mejbri, taunted opposition fans after scoring the second goal.

Champions Trophy: How good is Virat Kohli in football? | Rishabh Pant recovers from viral

It can never be easy to compete with a special talent like Rishabh Pant . Just ask KL Rahul . Ever since the Indian team management decided to persist with Rahul as the wicketkeeper-batter of choice in ODIs — despite the return of Pant — Rahul's spot has been under scrutiny. Many former cricketers and experts have expressed their preference for Pant, including former India head coach Ravi Shastri , who earlier expressed surprise that a player of Pant's abilities was sitting out.In the process, the 32-year-old Rahul's wonderful record at the No. 5 spot in ODIs have been ignored. In India's run to the final of the 2023 ODI World Cup, Rahul stroked 452 runs in 11 matches at an average of 75.33, with one hundred and two fifties (strike rate 90.76).Speaking to reporters on Friday at the Dubai International Stadium, Rahul, who cracked a fluent 47-ball 41 not out against Bangladesh in India's opening match, admitted to feeling the pressure of competition with Pant in the ODI team.Rahul admitted there was always a temptation for the coach and the captain to play Pant ahead of him. “There is (competition with Pant), I won't lie. He's obviously a very talented player and he's shown all of us what he can do and how aggressive and how quickly he can change the game,” Rahul said.""So, there's always the temptation for the team with the captain and coach to either play him or play me. For me, if I'm given the opportunity, I try and see what I can do best. I'm not trying to compete with Rishabh or I'm not trying to play like him. When he gets his opportunities, I'm sure he's not going to try to play like anybody else. He's picked on the basis of how he can play and what he can provide for the team. The same applies to me. So, I try to do what I do best and try to stick to my game,"" Rahul said.Rahul hinted that it was unlikely Pant would get to play a single game in the Champions Trophy due to the nature of the tournament, pointing out that there was just one day's gap between India's final group game and the semifinals, which means that India are likely to stick with the same playing XI.""Luckily, I am not part of the leadership group. I don't have to make that decision. But I'm sure there will be some temptation to try out players who have not gotten a game. I don't think that will happen in the Champions Trophy, because there is just one day's break between the final group stage game and the semifinal and we've got a six-day break. We probably want all players to play the game and get a little bit of time in the middle. That is my version. I don't know, it might be very different tomorrow,"" Rahul said.Refreshingly for a player who's been playing international cricket for a decade now, Rahul takes criticism of his strike rate — it's a healthy 87.74 in ODIs — constructively. He confessed that there were times when perhaps he could have batted faster, like in the 2023 ODI World Cup final in Ahmedabad against Australia, when he crawled to a 107-ball 66 as India folded up for 240 and lost the match by six wickets. It was an innings for which the Karnataka cricketer is still trolled.""Look, it's been there for quite a few years. I'm quite used to seeing it and hearing it and reading about it. Sometimes, I just sit back and see whether the criticism is valid,"" Rahul said.Rahul allayed any fitness concerns around India captain Rohit Sharma and pacer Mohammed Shami , who both went out of the field during the last game against Pakistan. ""Fitness-wise, everything seems pretty okay. There are no real concerns about anyone missing, as far as I know. Everyone has been at the gym, everyone has been in training,"" Rahul said.",KL Rahul admits to feeling the pressure of competition with Rishabh Pant in the ODI team.

BENGALURU: Delhi Capitals ticked all boxes in a comfortable nine-wicket victory over Mumbai Indians in their top-of-the-table Women’s Premier League clash at the M Chinnaswamy Stadium on Friday.After a disciplined bowling attack — led by Jess Jonassen (3/25) and Minnu Mani (3/17) — restricted MI to 123/9, DC openers Meg Lanning (60*, 49b, 9x4) and Shafali Verma (43, 28b, 4x4, 3x6) put up a blistering show to power Capitals to a nine-wicket victory in 14.3 overs.Invited to bat, MI openers Hayley Matthews (22, 4x4) and Yastika Bhatia (11, 1x4, 1x6) got off the mark with boundaries, taking 10 off Marizanne Kapp’s opening over. As the duo slowly settled down, Shikha Pandey (1/16) turned the tide, breaking the partnership in the final over of powerplay.The onus to revive the innings was on last match hero Nat Sciver-Brunt (18, 2x4) and skipper Harmanpreet Kaur (22, 2x4, 1x6). The duo brought up MI’s 50 in 9.1 overs. Harmanpreet looked to up the tempo, first launching Titas over long-on for a maximum and then working the final ball behind the square for a boundary. But MI’s joy was short-lived as Jess first trapped Harmanpreet to break the 38-run stand and then returned in the 14th over to dismiss Sciver-Brunt with a regulation return catch.Chasing the below par total, Capitals were off to a flying start as skipper Lanning and Shafali ensured they ended powerplay at 57 for no loss.

NEW DELHI: Ahead of India's crucial ICC Champions Trophy 2025 Group A clash against New Zealand on Sunday, assistant coach Ryan ten Doeschate addressed the ongoing debate surrounding the team's wicketkeeping choice between KL Rahul and Rishabh Pant . While Pant has remained on the sidelines, ten Doeschate acknowledged the tough selection calls at the highest level.""It's been very hard on Rishabh not playing, but that's the nature of sport at this level. KL's been good. He didn't get many chances, and when you're batting at six or seven, it's difficult to get proper opportunities,"" he said while speaking to reporters in Dubai.Despite limited opportunities, the former Netherlands international highlighted Rahul's contributions in crucial moments.""Obviously, in the third ODI in India, he did really well, and that knock against Bangladesh proved crucial in the end,"" he noted.With both Rahul and Pant being top-tier wicketkeepers, ten Doeschate emphasised the importance of keeping Pant ready for any situation.""We've got to keep Rishabh up and running. We never know when we're going to need him, but certainly, having two wicketkeepers of that calibre is a nice thing to have,"" he said.Meanwhile, Rahul himself admitted to feeling the pressure of having Pant waiting in the wings. While he remains focused on his own game, he acknowledged the constant temptation for the team to include Pant in the XI.""There is — I won't lie. I mean, he's obviously a very, very talented player, and he's shown all of us what he can do, and how aggressive and how quickly he can change the game. So yes, there's always the temptation for the team as well, whoever's the captain, the coach to — there's always that temptation to either play him or play me,"" Rahul admitted during a press conference on Friday.In the ongoing Champions Trophy, Rahul has embraced his role as India's designated wicketkeeper-batter. He continued his strong form in the tournament opener against Bangladesh, finishing unbeaten on 41 from 47 balls, a knock that included a four and two sixes.As India prepare for the encounter against New Zealand, the Rahul-Pant debate remains a key talking point, highlighting the depth and selection dilemmas within the squad.",KL Rahul and Rishabh Pant have been India's wicketkeepers in Champions Trophy.

Champions Trophy: Morne Morkel back as Team India practices at ICC Academy in Dubai

The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has stressed that they're taking stricter security protocols at all ICC Champions Trophy 2025 venues following consecutive pitch invasions in Rawalpindi and Lahore.The first security breach happened at the Rawalpindi Cricket Stadium during the Group A match between New Zealand and Bangladesh. A spectator ran onto the field to hug New Zealand batter Rachin Ravindra. Security staff quickly apprehended the intruder, who was subsequently arrested and received a ban from all cricket stadiums.A second incident occurred at the Gaddafi stadium in Lahore when a pitch invader disrupted Afghanistan's victory celebrations upon beating England on Wednesday night. While the festive atmosphere continued, this breach highlighted existing security vulnerabilities.These back-to-back pitch invasions during the marquee tournament have placed significant pressure on the PCB. The board has now committed to enhanced security measures to protect players, officials and spectators for the remainder of the ICC tournament.During the incident involving Ravindra, the individual, reportedly carrying a photograph of Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan leader Saad Rizvi, managed to evade security at the Rawalpindi Cricket Ground, before being apprehended.“The PCB has taken serious note of the security breach that occurred yesterday when a spectator entered the field of play. Ensuring the safety of players and officials remains our top priority. As a responsible organisation, we have engaged with local security agencies, who have committed to increasing security personnel around the field of play at all venues and strengthening access control measures,” PCB said in a statement after the incident.“The individual involved was arrested and presented before a court of law today (Tuesday). In addition, he has been permanently banned from entering all cricket venues in Pakistan,” the statement added.“To prevent such incidents in the future, the PCB is working closely with security agencies and venue authorities to review and reinforce security protocols,” it continued.The security breach has created concerns for the PCB, with Pakistan serving as host nation for a major ICC event for the first time since the 1996 World Cup.","The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has stressed that they're taking stricter security protocols at all ICC Champions Trophy 2025 venues.

Exclusive | Arjuna Awardee Vantika Agrawal: 'People still ask, 'Chess is fine, but what do you really do?''

NEW DELHI: Former Asian Games bronze-winner in volleyball and the father of badminton superstar PV Sindhu, PV Ramana, offers a balanced perspective on the debate surrounding the challenges of pursuing sports in India, particularly for middle-class families.Ramana's own journey, from a lower-middle-class background to becoming the parent of a two-time Olympic medalist Sindhu, serves as an instance of opportunities that sports can provide.""My father died when I was 3, I was the youngest of 10 siblings. But my elder brothers and sisters, they were so happy to support me and see me play national-level volleyball, why? Because I got a Railways job because of that sport,"" he told PTI. ""So, if you are lower middle-class or middle-class, being good in any sport actually opens up opportunities for you. Not to forget, sport is great for a child's overall development.""While acknowledging the challenges, Ramana emphasises the importance of finding a balance between sports and academics.""Talent always reveals itself and is never a prisoner of wealth. As a parent, you have to find the balance. When I realised my elder daughter was academically inclined, I encouraged her to pursue that,"" he said. ""With Sindhu, she was way ahead of everyone on the badminton court by the time she entered 10th standard in school. She had found sponsors because everyone could see she was destined for big things. We should trust the children too. They also have instincts. I don't think as a sportsperson, one should discourage others from sports.""Ramana believes that talent is not confined to wealth and that parents should trust their children's instincts and abilities and should not discourage them from taking up sports.""Getting a job through sport is one of the major considerations for middle-class parents and from what I know, there are plenty of opportunities. Railways itself is hiring thousands of athletes,"" he added. ""Also, being good in sports gets you admission in premier educational institutions through sports quota. It is the responsibility of the coaches to guide young players through proper notification of job openings and other opportunities. All academies should be doing this.""Furthermore, Ramana stresses the role of coaches in guiding young players through proper notification of job openings and other opportunities.""We should never forget that minimum graduation is required for an athlete too (to find a decent job). These days, there is quota in jobs for retired athletes as well,"" he added. ""So, don't discourage, let the child flow. In my view, they should be encouraged to find balance and pay attention to academics also because you are not training the entire day. There is time for other things.""""During Sindhu's formative years, there were days she would ask me how was it that some kids in her training travel by air while we always took the train. But look at her now,"" Ramana said.""Struggle will be there but you have to be prepared.""",PV Ramana is the father of two-time Olympic medalist PV Sindhu.

Can India overcome New Zealand in the ICC Champions Trophy?

NEW DELHI: South Africa clinched a dominant victory over England by seven wickets at the National Stadium on Saturday, topping Group B in the 2025 Champions Trophy. Rassie van der Dussen and Heinrich Klaasen both scored fifties, sharing a 127-run partnership off 122 balls.With this win, South Africa now await the semifinal draw to determine whether they will face India or New Zealand, while England suffered a disappointing exit from the tournament with three consecutive losses—Jos Buttler’s final game as captain ending in a crushing defeat.Earlier, pace all-rounders Wiaan Mulder and Marco Jansen each claimed three wickets, bowling England out for a meager 179 in 38.2 overs. Van der Dussen anchored the chase with a composed 72 not out off 87 balls, featuring six fours and three sixes.Klaasen contributed a swift 64 off 56 balls, including 11 boundaries, playing a crucial role as South Africa completed their chase in 29.1 overs.In their 180-run chase, South Africa started with a hectic 10-ball opening over in which Jofra Archer conceded five wides.Archer found success in the third over when Tristan Stubbs inside-edged his stumps for a five-ball duck, and Ryan Rickleton contributed 27 off 25 balls with five boundaries before falling to a well-disguised nip-backer from Archer.Amidst the action, van der Dussen struck two boundaries with solid punches, while Klaasen hit five boundaries in seven overs—including three off Jamie Overton.The duo rotated the strike effectively; van der Dussen later pulled and drove off Overton for two fours and punched Archer twice to reach his fifty in just 41 balls.Klaasen continued his onslaught in the 23rd over, pulling, punching, and flicking Archer for three fours to score 14 runs.Simultaneously, van der Dussen smacked and pulled Adil Rashid for six and four respectively, achieving his fifty in 72 balls. Shifting gears, van der Dussen then dispatched a juicy full toss from Liam Livingstone over wide long-on for six before hammering Rashid for another maximum.After overtaking Klaasen in the chase, he added a four off Livingstone, while Klaasen sliced a delivery to backward point off Rashid. David Miller sealed the victory by finishing off the chase with a six over the ground, sparking jubilation in the Proteas camp.","South Africa beat England by seven wickets to top Group B in Champions Trophy.

TimesofIndia.com in Dubai:

Champions Trophy: Rohit Sharma back to his belligerent best in final training session

Champions Trophy: Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli sweat it out in training session

For a large part of their final practice session before the game against New Zealand in the Champions Trophy , India batters Virat Kohli, Shreyas Iyer and KL Rahul deployed the sweep, reverse-sweeps and tried to explore different angles behind the wicket against the spinners. It's not usual to see Kohli go down on one knee for cheeky scoops and reverse-sweeps but the right-hander did make numerous attempts.Run-scoring hasn't been a free-flowing affair in the middle overs at the Dubai International Stadium and India batters, having already played two games here, have acknowledged that it's even difficult to rotate strike once the ball becomes a bit old and the pitch offers purchase for the slow bowlers. The powerplay period has been the best to score those quick runs and the moment the ball loses its sheen, the old-fashioned grind takes over. It hasn't mattered if the batter has been set or just walked in, batting overall has been a bit sluggish and a slow burn in the middle overs.Whether it was Shubman Gill, who scored a hundred vs Bangladesh, or Virat Kohli, who had an unbeaten ton vs Pakistan, batters have found it difficult to keep the scoreboard ticking and the trend is likely to continue in remaining games at the venue. As a batting group, the plan looks pretty straightforward at the moment. Rohit Sharma will go hammer and tongs in the powerplay, middle-order will take the game deep and then the slog-overs specialists take over. It's a typical ODI template but the crucial link - the middle-order - holds key because they need to ensure the side keeps the run-rate healthy when the opposition would look to apply the choke with spin.Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW! It was challenging against Bangladesh and Pakistan, who didn't have a lot of spin quality, and will only get stiff when they take on the Black Caps - who have shrewd operators led by captain Mitchell Santner in their ranks. The likes of Kohli, Iyer, Axar Patel and KL Rahul need to minimise the dot ball percentage during that period and batting deep is going to be the key as life is difficult for any new batter on the sluggish surfaces in Dubai.""The challenge like I just said on these wickets is rotating the strike as soon as you go in against spinners or fast bowlers. Once those dot balls start to pile up on a batsman, obviously the pressure builds up and you have to play that big shot. And that obviously gives the opposition and the bowlers an opportunity.""So that has been the challenge. But we've all got a little bit of time in the middle. And we're trying to find ways to see how we can rotate the strike a lot more. We're all very happy hitting boundaries and scoring boundaries, but on this wicket that is very difficult. We have to make sure that the dot ball percentage is really less and then the risk that you take, the opportunities that you are going to take is suited for this type of wicket and against a certain bowler,"" said Rahul at the pre-match presser.An otherwise free-flowing batter against spin, Iyer too has found it difficult to stay on top in the middle-overs and he had a watchful start against Pakistan where boundary balls weren't offered when Abrar Ahmed applied the brakes. It was only after spending enough time that he figured something different was required as even placing the ball in gaps became a challenge.""I thought initially I was struggling a bit to manoeuvre the ball in the gaps. I think Abrar bowled brilliantly. It was important and crucial for me to play out that spell and rotate the strike at the same time. I took some time, and then once my eyes were set, I thought that sweep and reverse sweep would have been a great option to put them on the back foot. And I think that worked pretty well for me,"" Iyer had said after scoring fifty vs Pakistan in the last game.At least in the nets, both Iyer and Rahul, along with Kohli, were sticking to the game plan. Rahul in particular was showing a lot of intent as demotion in the batting-order meant he is unlikely to get a lot of times to get his eye in. There's a cautious effort by the wicketkeeper-batter to look for a six and maximum boundaries early in his session and he has been repeating the drill ever since the team landed in Dubai.""I realised when I go in, I need to have that skill set to go in and be able to hit sixes probably from ball one or sometimes be able to play with a really high strike rate. That is the need of the hour. So that's why you see me practicing all of that. As soon as I go in, I challenge myself to see if I can hit a six of the first couple of deliveries or if I can hit boundaries. How many boundaries can I hit in the first 10 balls? Try and practice with an older ball. Try and practice on a slow pitch. That's more realistic to what I might get here. So that's what I try to do. And that's the only way you give yourself the best chance to succeed in a game and do what the team is expecting of you,"" explained Rahul.The batting group, having spent over two weeks in Dubai, have figured out the ideal template for run-scoring and they would now look to ensure that the comprehensive preparations translate into positive results.","Virat Kohli, Shreyas Iyer and KL Rahul tried different angles behind the wicket against the spinners. India batters have acknowledged that it's even difficult to rotate strike once the ball becomes a bit old and the pitch offers purchase for the slow bowlers.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118649641,imgsize-282644,width-400,resizemode-4/118649641.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Millwall goalkeeper Liam Roberts was involved in a reckless incident during Saturday's FA Cup match against Crystal Palace. Just eight minutes into the game, Roberts rushed out of his penalty area to clear a long ball, but his high left-footed follow-through struck Crystal Palace forward Jean-Philippe Mateta in the side of the face.Mateta, going unconscious immediately, sustained a serious injury and required lengthy medical attention on the field. He was fitted with a neck brace and carried off on a stretcher toward an ambulance.Palace said later on Saturday that Mateta had been discharged from hospital.Watch:Philippe-Mateta later said he is doing well and hopes to be back soon. ""Thank you for all your kind messages. I'm doing well. I hope to be back very soon. And stronger than ever. Well done guys for a great job today,"" Mateta posted on Instagram.The club confirmed he received 25 stitches. ""He received specialist treatment and 25 stitches to a severe laceration to his left ear. All scans were clear and JP is feeling well,"" the club said.""He will now rest and recuperate over the following days where his progress will be monitored by our club doctor.""According to Crystal Palace chairman Steve Parish, Mateta suffered a severe gash behind his ear and a head injury, necessitating a hospital visit. Parish expressed his disbelief at the challenge, describing it as the ""most reckless challenge on a football pitch"" he had ever witnessed in his time watching the sport.Palace manager Oliver Glasner said the challenge could have ended the Frenchman's career.""Just imagine if he hits his face straight, with his power, with the studs, it is the end of JP's career,"" said Glasner.""I'm pretty sure he didn't want to injure JP in this situation, but I also think that you have to decide when you make such an impact, you just can't do it in this way.""Initially, referee Michael Oliver did not issue a card for the challenge, despite being in close proximity to the incident. However, after being advised by VAR to review the incident on the pitch-side monitor, Oliver showed Roberts a straight red card.Mateta had scored eight goals in his previous nine games and has 15 in total for Palace this season. The 27-year-old also netted five times as France won silver at the Paris Olympics last year.Palace made use of the man advantage for virtually the whole game to book their place in the quarter-finals.Japhet Tanganga's own goal broke the visitors' resistance before Daniel Munoz prodded in a second.Wes Harding pulled a goal back for the Lions, 13 minutes into first-half stoppage time added on for Mateta's treatment.Palace were made to wait until 82 minutes to ensure progress when Eddie Nketiah's looping header found the far corner.",Millwall goalkeeper Liam Roberts sent off for reckless challenge on Jean- Philippe Mateta.

MUMBAI: As Mumbai City welcome champions Mohun Bagan SG at the Mumbai Football Arena on Saturday, the fixture serves as a reminder of how drastically circumstances have changed compared to when the two sides clashed in Kolkata just under a year ago.Back then, just two points separated leaders Mumbai and second-placed Bagan, as they battled it out for the Shield in a dream final match of the league phase.The Islanders will find it ironic to think that their quest to become the first Indian Super League side to defend the Shield was wrecked that mid-April evening at Salt Lake Stadium by a team who now own that piece of history.Dimitrios Petratos ’s injurytime winner against Odisha last Sunday ensured Bagan would accomplish what Mumbai couldn’t — win the Shield in successive seasons.Even as the Kolkata giants have maintained their level, it’s been a different story for Petr Kratky’s Mumbai who have struggled to find consistency all season. A look at the table sums up the glaring difference between the two teams this time, as 20 points separate the champions from the Islanders, who sit in sixth spot with 32 points from 21 matches. Kratky, however, maintains his side haven’t declined, in fact going on to insist that Mumbai have even improved in some areas.""If we talk about levels, Mohun Bagan is more effective in final third, scoring more goals than us,"" said the Mumbai coach.","Mumbai City welcome champions Mohun Bagan SG at the Mumbai Football Arena on Saturday.

DUBAI: The thread running through Stefanos Tsitsipas ’ run at the Dubai Duty Free tennis championship this week has been his fight, not the lack of it. The gifted Greek appeared lost on the court for most part of the last couple of years, and it gradually reflected on his ranking which dipped out of the top-10 for the first time in five years last Feb.The 26-year-old backed himself with successive three set wins over Karen Khachanov and Matteo Berrettini to make the last-four here, his first ATP 500 semis since last July. Tsitsipas then beat Dutchman Tallon Griekspoor 6-4, 6-4 to make the final, where he meets Felix Auger-Aliassime .""The ability to fight is the most important one for an athlete, once you lose that, you are useless on the court,"" Tsitsipas said. ""There is no match without fighting, you have to fight. The best victories are the ones you fought for. You’re not in control (of the match) and you somehow find that little gap and you win the match, that’s the most thrilling moment a tennis player can experience.""You feel a little lost, not that confident with certain things that you have done to your game,"" Tsitsipas said of the road back. ""It’s difficult to fake the confidence. It helps if you win, and you see yourself in the level that you are kind of imagining in your mind. That brings you confidence.""The World No.11 – a six-time Grand Slam semifinalist, and twice finalist at Roland Garros (2021) and Australian Open (2023) – rued the lost opportunity of seasons gone.

I need to recreate those moments.""Not unsurprisingly, the Tsitsipas corner wears a different look these days.

The first thing is to be honest with yourself, then start to be more aware.""This search for his true self is stirred by a one-word reminder - responsibility -which Rublev writes on his shoes. Every time he looks down the word stares back at him. ""I'm putting that word there to remind myself that I'm the one, it's not because of anything or anyone. If something bad or good happens to me, it's not because of luck but because I made a mistake (or did something right). You cannot blame anything or anyone, this is a reminder to myself not to complain.""",Andrey Rublev talks about his struggles with burnout and depression. The World No. 9 won his 17th career title in Doha last week. Rublev was defaulted at the Dubai Duty Free tennis championships 12 months ago.

Teen sensation Mirra Andreeva sets sight on top-5 finish this season,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/top-stories/teen-sensation-mirra-andreeva-sets-sight-on-top-5-finish-this-season/articleshow/118521390.cms,"DUBAI: Mirra Andreeva acts her age at times, like when she's talking shop, but in the rectangle, sentineling the lines, she flaunts a steel that belies her years.The 17-year-old, who on Saturday claimed the Dubai Duty-Free tennis championship with a 7-6 (1), 6-1 win over Clara Tauson , is the youngest winner of a WTA 1000 title . Andreeva, the only teenager in the top-100 of the rankings, was relentless in her attitude and approach even if her tennis at times was weary.The Russian noted that confidence is easy to wear when things are going your way. ""The ball is flying, you hit a lot of winners,"" she said. ""The hardest part is to be positive, to be there (in the moment) 100 per cent mentally, when things are not going your way.""For much of her near two-hours on court against the in-form Tauson, the Russian tried but couldn't produce the tennis that saw her put out three Grand Slam champions - Marketa Vondrousova, Iga Swiatek and Elena Rybakina - in a week. ""I told myself, you can either let that negativity come into your head or you can choose to fight for every point,"" Andreeva said. ""I've been listening to a lot of LeBron James interviews. He said it's easy to be confident and to play good when everything goes your way. What makes you a champion is when you're giving your best when you don't feel great. That's what I tried to do in the final.""Andreeva's goal for the 2025 season was to break into the top-10, now that she has debuted in the top tier at No.9 this week, the teenager promptly raised the bar.""The higher your ranking is, the slower the climb (becomes) because the difference in the points is very little,"" she said. ""If I win another tournament, I'm going to be top-eight maybe. If I win another tournament, I can still be top eight. It's going to be hard to enter the Top-five. That is the goal I'm going to set for myself, to be Top-five by the end of the year.""When asked what she'd do with this week's earnings of $597,000, Andreeva shrugged. She felt she had everything she needed.""I don't know what I want, I feel like I have everything. I won the tournament. I've already reached the goal that I had set for myself for the end of the year,"" she said, adding, ""My family is traveling with me. I have a great team. I feel happy, and this is all I need.""A couple of minutes later she was asked if she likes to shop, Andreeva's face mirrored a light bulb.""Yes, of course I like shopping, it doesn't matter what I buy, just as long as I buy something, I already feel good. It can be jewelry, a pair of jeans, socks, cap… As long as I buy something, I feel like the day is successful,"" Andreeva said, noting that her father Alexander doesn't like to shop. ""I like to buy something, even something from the grocery store.""It's easy to forget Andreeva's age when she's on the tennis court, serving big and painting the lines with her groundstrokes. Just as well that she doesn't hold back when she's not aiming for the lines.","Mirra Andreeva is the youngest winner of a WTA 1000 title. The 17-year-old Russian beat Clara Tauson 7-6 (1), 6-1 in the Dubai Duty-Free final. She is the only teenager in the top-100 of the rankings.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118521386,imgsize-71446,width-400,resizemode-4/118521386.jpg"

DUBAI: Alex de Minaur put it simply. In modern-day tennis, where power brings glory, the 26-year-old has had to 'adapt or die'.De Minaur, the second seed in the Dubai Duty Free tennis championships - a 500 Series event for the men which gets underway on Monday - is one of five men in the ATP's top25, who stands at 6 ft (183 cms), the shortest in the top-tier of the sport.The Aussie, ranked eighth in the world, broke into the top-10 for the first time last Jan, and has spent most of the last 14 months in that elite bracket.De Minaur, who opens against the 6-ft-6-in veteran Marin Cilic in the first round here, shares a 2-2 head-to-head record with the 36-year-old Croat. ""I'm looking forward to a tough first-round match - a veteran player with a lot of experience, very dangerous, especially on these types of courts. I'm expecting a battle,"" he said.De Minaur, who took Carlos Alcaraz the distance in the final at Rotterdam in early Feb, likes how he has started the year.""I'm happy, I have played some great tennis. I've lost to Jannik (Sinner), to Carlos (Alcaraz) and now I lost to Andrey (Rublev in Doha last week) after having a match point, the last one stings a little bit because I feel like I had my chances. It's all about putting myself in those situations, giving myself the opportunity.""De Minaur said, ""People are hitting the ball with a lot more force (today). You're losing a little bit of that variety that you had with the likes of Roger (Federer). It feels like everything's a lot more fast-paced, because of the tech, racquets, balls… Conditions are slower, everyone is hitting the ball so much harder.""Nice guy De Minaur, nicknamed 'Demon', found inspiration in where he finished last year, inside the top-10 and making the season-ending field in Turin.Mirra Andreeva became the youngest at 17 years to clinch a WTA 1000 title since its inception 16 years ago. The Russian claimed the Dubai Duty Free tennis championship with a 7-6 (1), 6-1 win over Denmark's Clara Tauson on Saturday evening.Andreeva, ranked 14 at the start of the tournament, is the only teenager in the top 100 of the WTA rankings. When the new rankings come out on Monday she will debut in the top-10, making her the youngest to achieve that since Nicole Vaidisova nearly 19 years ago.","Alex de Minaur is the second seed in the Dubai Duty Free tennis championships.

He emphasised that his coach's observations accurately portray the realities of India's sporting environment.Kashyap specifically addressed the absence of support systems for athletes who don't achieve top-level success.

In a country where success in sports - outside of cricket - rarely guarantees financial security or societal respect, his call for caution is pragmatic, not pessimistic.""The middle class, often tethered to the promise of stable jobs and education, risks everything by banking on athletic glory when the odds are stacked against them - less than 1% make it big, and even fewer sustain a livelihood post-career.""Kashyap, who achieved career-high ranking of World No. 6 during his playing days, interpreted Gopichand's comments as a necessary call to address fundamental issues in Indian sports.""Look at the examples he cited: national champions relegated to junior clerk roles or Olympic medallists struggling in dead-end sports quota jobs, facing humiliation rather than honour.""""India's infrastructure may be improving, but without robust systems to skill up athletes for alternative careers or ensure dignity in retirement, the dream of sporting success remains a gamble most can't afford.""""Gopi sir's not discouraging passion - he's urging a hard look at the structural gaps that leave most athletes high and dry.

It's crucial that we all understand and make this distinction clear.""Gopichand had recently sparked debate by suggesting that middle-class families should reconsider professional sports careers due to insufficient support systems for athletes who don't reach elite levels.",Parupalli Kashyap backs Pullela Gopichand's comments about middle-class families in sports.

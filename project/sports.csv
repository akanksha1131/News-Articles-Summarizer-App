Virat Kohli steers India to third consecutive Champions Trophy final

South Africa's David Miller expressed concerns about his team's brief trip to Dubai before their Champions Trophy semi-final loss to New Zealand in Lahore.The tournament's complex scheduling required both Australia and South Africa to fly to Dubai from Pakistan prior to the semi-finals. South Africa's stay lasted less than 24 hours before returning without playing any matches.Australia remained in Dubai and subsequently lost to India in their semi-final match. The scheduling complications arose because India played all their matches in Dubai, refusing to travel to tournament hosts Pakistan due to political and safety reasons.""It's only an hour and 40 minute flight, but the fact that we had to do that was not ideal,"" Miller said after South Africa's 50-run defeat to New Zealand on Wednesday.South Africa made this trip shortly after defeating England in Karachi on Saturday.""It's early morning, it's after a game and we had to fly. Then we got to Dubai at 4:00 pm. And at 7.30 am we had to come back. It doesn't make it nice. It's not like we flew five hours, and we had enough time to recover and recuperate, but it was not an ideal situation still.""Miller scored an unbeaten century off 67 balls, but it wasn't enough to prevent South Africa's loss to New Zealand, who will now face India in Sunday's final in Dubai.New Zealand set a Champions Trophy record by posting 362-6, powered by impressive centuries from Rachin Ravindra and Kane Williamson.Temba Bavuma and Rassie van der Dussen contributed 56 and 69 runs respectively, forming a crucial 105-run partnership for the second wicket. However, New Zealand's spinners, led by Mitchell Santner's 3-43, restricted South Africa to 312-9.""It's not easy chasing 360 even if it's a good wicket,"" said Miller, who hit four sixes and 10 fours in his seventh ODI hundred. ""I think the wicket just deteriorated as the game went on and they spun the ball a lot more than us. It's just they got a little bit more purchase out of the wicket.""Regarding the upcoming final, Miller shared his preference: ""I'll be honest with you, I think I'll be supporting New Zealand.""",South Africa lost to New Zealand in Champions Trophy semi-final in Lahore.

Steve Smith after Champions Trophy loss: 'India outplayed us and deserve the victory'

By entering the final of the Champions Trophy after defeating Australia in the semis on Tuesday in Dubai, India captain Rohit Sharma achieved what no other captain in the history of cricket has ever accomplished.Rohit is now the only captain to have led his team to the finals of all International Cricket Council (ICC) tournaments: ODI World Cup , T20 World Cup , Champions Trophy and World Test Championship (WTC). And he has achieved that in just three years' time.It is also India's fifth entry into a Champions Trophy final -- which extended their record as no other team has done it more than three times.In 2023, India qualified for the WTC final and the ODI World Cup final, losing to Australia on both the occasions. The next year, in 2024, India won the T20 World Cup under Rohit by beating South Africa in the final. It was India's first ICC title in 10 years and the second T20 World Cup triumph since 2007.If India go on to win this Champions Trophy, Rohit will join MS Dhoni as the two captains to have led India to victory in the tournament. India previously won the title under Dhoni's captaincy in 2013.While Rohit has given the team brisk starts in their four matches of this Champions Trophy campaign, a big knock is still awaited from the Indian skipper.So far, he has scored only 104 runs with a highest of 41 and would want to mark the tournament with a match-winning knock in the final on March 9.",Rohit Sharma is the only captain to have led his team to the finals of all International Cricket Council (ICC) tournaments.

Gautam Gambhir hits out at critics after India beat Australia to reach Champions Trophy final

In terms of numbers, India captain and opener Rohit Sharma may not have produced the amount of runs fans associate with him, but the skipper's intent in the ongoing Champions Trophy has had a positive impact on the dressing room, according to the team's head coach Gautam Gambhir India remained unbeaten in the group stage, beating Bangladesh, Pakistan and New Zealand; and went on to defeat Australia in the semifinal on Tuesday in Dubai by four wickets.After the match, Gambhir was asked a question on Rohit's performance in the four matches of the tournament, which have seen him accumulate just 104 runs at an average of 26.00 and highest of 41.A clearly flustered Gambhir came all out in support of Rohit, reminding the reporter that there is the Champions Trophy final to play.""Abhi to final hai Champions Trophy ka. Uss se pehle mai aapko kya jawab du? (there is the final of the Champions Trophy; what should I tell you before that?)"" Gambhir reacted.He went on to throw his weight behind the captain, saying that the number of runs scored by a batter is not how the team management evaluate performances, stressing on the impact Rohit has had on the campaign with his fearless approach at the top of the order.""If your captain bats with such a tempo, it gives a very good signal to the dressing room that we want to be absolutely fearless and courageous,"" said Gambhir.""You evaluate with runs, we evaluate with impact. That's the difference. You evaluate with stats, we evaluate with impact. As journalists and experts, you see numbers and averages. But as a coach and as a team, we don't see numbers and averages.""The coach added that Rohit is leading by example for the way the team wants to perform.""If it's the captain who is the first to raise his hand in the kind of cricket we want to play, then there can't be a better thing for that dressing room,"" said Gambhir.India were led by 'Man of the Match' Virat Kohli's 84 to go past Australia's 264 in the semi-final on Tuesday.The 2013 champions will meet the winners of the second semifinal between South Africa and New Zealand to be played on Wednesday in Lahore.",India coach Gautam Gambhir says Rohit Sharma is leading by example.

NEW DELHI: Kolkata Knight Riders captain Ajinkya Rahane attributes his success in the Indian Premier League and domestic Twenty20 matches to playing ""fearless cricket"" while maintaining composure.At a strike rate of 164.56, the 36-year-old scored 469 runs, including five half-centuries, to top the batting rankings in the previous edition of the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy. In the IPL , where he was the Chennai Super Kings' batting mainstay for the last two seasons, his aggressive style also paid dividends.""It was always about being an anchor and the others would play around me. (But the) last 2-3 years, it's always about playing with freedom, fearless cricket and go out and back my game,"" Rahane, the brand ambassador of Skillhub Online Games Federation, said in Mumbai on Tuesday.""I am trying to do that (play fearless cricket) but it's (also) about following my processes and routines and staying loyal and truthful to the game.""Rahane, who made 467 runs and guided Mumbai to the Ranji Trophy semifinal, stated that he would bring the confidence he has gained from domestic cricket to the next IPL season.""For me, personally, batting-wise I am doing really well. Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy was really good for me, I had a really good domestic season. So, I am really confident about myself,"" he said.""It is just about staying in the moment, staying calm and keep backing myself, not to think too much ahead and not to think about the past. It's always about improving and enjoying my game,"" he added.Rahane said that India's triumph in Tuesday's Champions Trophy semifinal in Dubai was also due to the team's decision to move on from its history versus Australia in ICC tournament knockout stages.Since the 2011 World Cup quarterfinal in India, India had never defeated Australia in the ICC competition knockout stages until Rohit Sharma 's team prevailed by four wickets.Australia defeated India in the 2023 World Cup final, the 2023 World Test Championship final, and the 2015 Cricket World Cup semifinal.""Very happy that India has won the semifinal against Australia and have entered the final. I want to congratulate the team and I am sure they will do well in the final,"" Rahane said.""What happened in the past is gone, the team must be thinking about the present and their aim was to beat Australia... to beat them in the semifinal.""Obviously, what has happened in the past keeps playing on the mind but, as a cricketer, your mind is always in the moment, in the present, to do well in that game to win the match,"" Rahane said.Ahead of the forthcoming IPL season, Rahane, who was named captain of KKR, stated that he wants the reigning IPL winners to keep it simple.""Our team is really good, everyone is playing really well.

We would like to keep it simple, take one game at a time and stay in the moment and enjoy the format,"" Rahane added.","Kolkata Knight Riders captain Ajinkya Rahane attributes his success in the Indian Premier League and domestic Twenty20 matches to playing ""fearless cricket"" The 36-year-old scored 469 runs, including five half-centuries, to top the batting rankings in the previous edition of the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy. Rahane said that India's triumph in Tuesday's Champions Trophy semifinal in Dubai was also due to the team's decision to move on from its history versus Australia.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118726661,imgsize-26988,width-400,resizemode-4/118726661.jpg"

Gautam Gambhir hits out at critics after India beat Australia to reach Champions Trophy final

NEW DELHI: BCCI vice president Rajeev Shukla has made it clear that the resumption of bilateral cricket ties between India and Pakistan is subject to the Indian government's approval. As a senior BCCI official, he emphasised that the board will follow the government's decision on this matter.Shukla acknowledged that fans from both countries desire the resumption of bilateral ties, but he did not sound optimistic about the idea of playing at a neutral venue.""As far as you are asking about (cricket) between the two countries, it is very categorical and clear that it is the (Indian) government's decision. Whatever the government of India says, we will go as per them,"" Shukla told the Pakistan media. ""Pakistan is hosting an international tournament after a long time and it is a good thing. They have organised it well.""""It is true that fans from both the countries want the teams to play but the BCCI policy has been, and PCB would too have such a policy, that bilateral matches should be held on each other's soil and not at a third (or) neutral venue,"" he added. ""This has been BCCI's consistent policy. There is also a provision in the ICC which is about the government's consent. It is a big provision, so it happens according to the point of view of government's consent.""Regarding the Champions Trophy , Shukla refuted the argument that the Indian team has enjoyed an unfair advantage by playing all their matches at a single venue.""Every other country would offer to host India-Pakistan, who would not?"" the veteran noted. ""We (BCCI) keep our point in front of the government, but they decide after their deliberations. When the government takes a decision, it is after considering a lot of aspects. It is their internal matter.""He further asserted that the Indian team does not rely on favorable pitches but rather on their performances and the players' strengths, saying, ""When this decision was taken at the ICC level, it was decided that India-centric matches will be in Dubai and the rest of the matches will be in Pakistan, so it is not a question of fair or unfair. The Indian team doesn't depend on pitches, even there (in Dubai) there are different kinds of pitches. The team plays on its performances, the players play on their strengths and not depend on pitches.""On the subject of the Asia Cup scheduling , Shukla stated, ""You know it is status quo, so it will happen accordingly. I had come here for the Asia Cup as well. Roger Binny was also there and Jay Shah has also been cooperating completely.""",Rajeev Shukla says resumption of bilateral cricket ties between India and Pakistan is subject to Indian government's approval.

Pakistan cricket in decline

Champions Trophy: 'Any victory against Pakistan is sweet,' says Shreyas Iyer

Champions Trophy: 'India put in more effort, were braver than us,' admits Mohammad Rizwan

Pakistan Cricket: Glorious past, uncertain future

NEW DELHI: Defending champions Pakistan fought hard to get hosting rights for the ICC Champions Trophy 2025 and made sincere efforts to make it a grand spectacle. Although India didn't travel to Pakistan and instead opted to play their matches in Dubai, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) tried its best to make the Champions Trophy a successful event — renovating the stadiums was part of it.However, Pakistan cricket team failed to meet the high expectations of the home crowd and crashed out after back-to-back defeats against New Zealand (by 60 runs) and India (by 6 wickets), with their last league match against Bangladesh being washed out.For those following Pakistan cricket closely, this outcome was hardly surprising. Over the last decade, Pakistan’s performances in international cricket have steadily declined from bad to worse to tragic — with ICC events being no exception.A look at India vs Pakistan ODIs across ICC events and Asia Cup since the 2015 World Cup tells the story. In their 10 meetings, Pakistan have won just once — in the 2017 Champions Trophy final. India have won eight times, while one match was abandoned due to rain.More concerning is the margins of defeat: 76 runs, 124 runs, 8 wickets, 9 wickets, 89 runs, 228 runs, 7 wickets, and now 6 wickets in Dubai. Clearly, Pakistan haven’t even come close in these contests.This is just an example. The picture becomes clearer if we go through the overall performance of Pakistan.They have failed to reach the final four of the last three ICC ODI World Cups in 2015, 2019, and 2023, and neither did they make it to the semifinal of the 2024 T20 World Cup and even lost to the USA, who were playing their first-ever World Cup.And the World Test Championship? Well, Pakistan has progressively regressed (if that is even a phrase) and have finished at 6th, 7th, and 9th position of 2019-21, 2021-23, and 2023-25 cycles, respectively.But one must wonder, what has gone wrong for Pakistan cricket?Why has the cricket of the nation, which once produced world-class players like Hanif Mohammad, Imran Khan, Wasim, Waqar, and Shoaib Akhtar , to name just a few, seen its downfall so drastically?The reasons for this are plenty — from instability in the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) to broken domestic cricket structure and, of course, bad cricket.Pakistan Cricket Board, like the country's politics, has been an example of instability.The PCB remains bound to the politics of the nation. The prime minister of Pakistan appoints the chairperson of PCB. But even by their standard, the instability and uncertainty in the PCB since 2021 have gone too far.Since August 2021, when PCB chairperson Ehsan Mani stepped down from his post, PCB has had 4 chairpersons, more than half a dozen coaches, and 26 selectors.Four chairpersons since Ehsan Mani stepped down. Ramiz Raja , Najam Sethi, Zaka Ashraf , and now Mohsin Naqvi have all been different from others in terms of policy and approach.Najam Sethi even reversed progress by reinstating the 2014 PCB constitution in place of the 2019 version, effectively rolling back key reforms.Additionally, he disrupted the domestic cricket framework by reintroducing departmental cricket, all within a span of less than six months.Meanwhile, as for the incumbent Mohsin Naqvi, juggling his role as the country's interior minister, one has to wonder: How much attention can he realistically give to Pakistan cricket?Pakistan men's team has had nine head coaches in this period, including interim appointments and separate roles for red- and white-ball cricket. The frequent changes have disrupted coaching systems and strategies.Misbah-ul-Haq held a traditional head coach role while also serving as chief selector. Mickey Arthur briefly returned as team director, with Grant Bradburn as head coach.Then, Mohammad Hafeez combined the team director and head coach roles. Then, there was no team director, but two head coaches — Gary Kirsten for white ball, and Jason Gillespie for red ball — both of them resigned in October and December last year, respectively.Aqib Javed has since been serving as the interim coach of the team.Since August 2021, Pakistan has cycled through 26 different selectors, experimenting with various selection structures. They’ve used traditional committees with a chief and a few members, a setup with a chief and consultants.Some committees included the coach and captain, while others had seven voting members but no chief. The current setup consists of five members. Instability, you see.When there's such volatility at the helm, it inevitably cascades down to the bottom. After a poor 50-over World Cup in 2023 in India, Babar was replaced as captain by Shaheen Afridi in white-ball cricket and Shan Masood in Tests.ALSO READ: Babar, Rizwan dropped from Pakistan's T20I squad for New Zealand series However, Shaheen lasted only five matches, losing 4-1 to New Zealand, before the chairmanship changed and Babar was reinstated.One can only envisage the impact on Shaheen's morale, notwithstanding the inevitable tension created between the squad's two stalwarts. Babar Azam later resigned from captaincy, and Mohammad Rizwan took over as white-ball captain.Given this perpetual upheaval, it's hardly astonishing that both emerging and seasoned players appear distinctly unsettled.Who is there to help Shaheen Shah Afridi get back to his best? Who will enlighten Haris Rauf about his match-winning prowess?The PCB seems to be revamping its domestic cricket structure — if there's any structure at all — every now and then. The structure of the first-class tournament has undergone frequent changes, with regional and departmental teams alternating between playing separately one season and together the next.In 2022, Najam Sethi scrapped the domestic structure introduced under Imran Khan’s tenure, reintroducing departmental cricket.Meanwhile, Ramiz Raja had launched the Pakistan Junior League (T20 for youth) in 2022, but the new administration scrapped it after one season. The tournament earned PKR 94.72 million but incurred costs of PKR 929 million — a massive financial disaster.Meanwhile, Mohsin Naqvi introduced three new 'Champions' domestic tournaments last year — Champions One-Day Cup, a Champions T20 Cup, and the Champions Pentangular (first-class cricket) — taking the total count of domestic tournaments to 8.However, it remains unclear what these additions will accomplish that the existing five tournaments have not, other than inflating the schedule and stretching the domestic season to nearly a full year.While all this is true, it can not hide or be used as an excuse for the fact that the quality of Pakistan men's cricket has significantly descended.The Babar Azams and Shaheen Afridis of the team were projected as they were destined for greatness; there were signs, but they have not evolved their game.With all solidarity to Babar Azam for how he has been treated by Pakistani media or the PCB and the pressure mounted on him, there is no doubt that his performance has gone down significantly.Shaheen Shah Afridi has lost his zip, while Naseem Shah no longer possesses the same pace he once did.Despite extensive experience, Haris Rauf still struggles with accuracy in the longer formats. As white-ball captain, Mohammad Rizwan often appears lost on the field.And when it comes to spinners, have Pakistan produced a single name, since Saeed Ajmal’s departure a decade ago, who has truly set the cricketing world alight?The Pakistan team was referred to as unpredictable, now they just look unprepared and incapable.Pakistan were once a powerhouse in world cricket. Their cricket was never just about numbers or stats; it was about flair, aggression, and an undeniable ability to rise on the biggest stages.Pakistan have always been a source of excitement, producing fast bowlers who could send shivers down a batter’s spine, spinners like Abdul Qadir and Saqlain Mushtaq who made even the best look clueless, and batters like Inzamam ul Haq and Mohammad Yousuf, who played with a mix of elegance and audacity.Remember Shoaib Akhtar running in hard at Kolkata's Eden Gardens, dismantling Rahul Dravid and Sachin Tendulkar's stumps in consecutive deliveries?Or, more recently, Wahab Riaz's fiery spell to Shane Watson in World Cup 2015, and Mohammed Amir running through the Indian batting line-up in the 2017 Champions Trophy final?That was Pakistan cricket at its best, producing moments of sheer brilliance that only Pakistan seemed capable of creating.We’ve already seen what happens when once-great teams fade away.West Indies, the team that once ruled world cricket now struggle to even qualify for major tournaments. Sri Lanka, a side that played the most fearless of cricket in the late 90s and early 2000s, are now a shadow of itself.If Pakistan go down the same path, cricket risks losing yet another team with a rich history and one that is passionately followed.For the game to prosper, Pakistan cricket must rediscover its lost spark.Stability in administration, a well-structured domestic system, and a clear vision for player development are crucial steps in reversing the downward spiral.More importantly, the players need guidance, belief, and an environment where they can grow into the world-class cricketers they were once destined to be.Pakistan must find a way to rise again. Cricket needs it—not just for its history, but for its future.","Pakistan crashed out of the ICC Champions Trophy after back-to-back defeats.

New Zealand’s Batting Masterclass

Ravindra and Williamson’s Record Partnership

Key Moments

Late Flourish by Phillips and Santner

South Africa’s Bowling Efforts

What’s Next?

In a high-stakes encounter at the Gaddafi Stadium in Lahore, New Zealand has posted a formidable total of 362/6 in their 50 overs against South Africa in the second semi-final of the ICC Champions Trophy 2025. The Kiwis, led by some stellar batting performances, have set a challenging target for the Proteas, who will need to bat out of their skins to secure a spot in the final.New Zealand won the toss and elected to bat first, a decision that paid off handsomely as their top order laid a solid foundation. The opening pair of Will Young and Rachin Ravindra started cautiously but soon found their rhythm. Young, however, fell early for 21 runs in the 8th over, caught by Aiden Markram off Lungi Ngidi’s bowling. This brought Kane Williamson to the crease, and what followed was a masterclass in batting.Rachin Ravindra and Kane Williamson stitched together a mammoth 164-run partnership for the second wicket, which set the tone for New Zealand’s innings. Ravindra, the young left-hander, was in sublime touch, scoring his fifth ODI century. He reached his hundred in just 93 balls, hitting 12 fours and a six. Williamson, on the other hand, played the perfect anchor, scoring his 48th ODI fifty and eventually converting it into his 15th ODI century. The duo’s partnership was a treat to watch, as they effortlessly rotated the strike and punished the bad deliveries.7.5 overs, Ball 47: Will Young departs for 21, caught by Aiden Markram off Lungi Ngidi’s bowling. New Zealand 48/1.17.3 overs, Ball 105: New Zealand reaches 100 runs, with Ravindra and Williamson going strong.30.3 overs, Ball 183: South Africa reviews a caught-behind decision against Ravindra, but the review is unsuccessful. Ravindra continues his onslaught.32.0 overs, Ball 192: Ravindra brings up his fifth ODI hundred with a boundary. New Zealand 201/1.39.3 overs, Ball 237: Williamson reaches his 15th ODI century, scoring 101 runs off 91 balls. New Zealand 250/2.46.1 overs, Ball 277: Daryl Mitchell falls for 49, caught by Kagiso Rabada off Ngidi’s bowling. New Zealand 314/5.49.5 overs, Ball 299: Michael Bracewell is dismissed for 16, caught by Ryan Rickelton off Ngidi. New Zealand 360/6.After the dismissals of Ravindra and Williamson, Glenn Phillips provided the late fireworks with a quickfire 49 off just 27 balls, including six fours and a six. His aggressive batting in the death overs ensured that New Zealand crossed the 350-run mark. Mitchell Santner also chipped in with a couple of runs in the final over, taking New Zealand to a commanding total.South Africa’s bowlers had a tough day at the office. Lungi Ngidi was the pick of the bowlers, finishing with figures of 3/72 in his 10 overs. Kagiso Rabada also picked up two wickets but was expensive, conceding 70 runs. Marco Jansen and Keshav Maharaj were economical but failed to pick up wickets, which allowed New Zealand to build partnerships.South Africa now faces a daunting task of chasing down 363 runs to book their place in the final. With a strong batting lineup, including the likes of Temba Bavuma, Rassie van der Dussen, and David Miller, the Proteas will back themselves to chase down the target. However, the pressure of a semi-final and a challenging pitch could play a role in the outcome.As the second innings approaches, all eyes will be on how South Africa’s top order responds to the pressure. Will they crumble under the weight of the target, or will they rise to the occasion and script a memorable chase? Only time will tell.Stay tuned for more updates as the action unfolds in Lahore!","New Zealand has posted a formidable total of 362/6 in their 50 overs against South Africa in the second semi-final of the ICC Champions Trophy 2025.

NEW DELHI: Steve Smith ’s recent retirement from One-Day International (ODI) cricket marks the end of an era for one of Australia’s most skilled and strategic leaders.While Smith will continue to be a key figure in Test and T20 cricket, his legacy in the 50-over format invites discussion -- where does he stand among Australia’s greatest ODI captains?Statistically, Smith holds a respectable position among Australia’s ODI captains.With 40 matches at the helm, captain Smith boasts a solid 57.50% win rate, placing him seventh on the list of Australian skippers with the most matches.His leadership period saw Australia maintain its competitive edge, though he never led the team to a major ICC tournament victory.Considered one of the finest players of the white-ball cricket, Smith racked up two ICC World Cup titles in 2015 and 2023 under the captaincy of Michael Clarke and Pat Cummins, respectively.When considering individual batting performances as a captain, Smith amassed 2,270 runs at an impressive average of 43.65.This puts him fifth among Australian skippers, trailing legends like Ricky Ponting, Allan Border, Michael Clarke, and Steve Waugh.His highest ODI score of 164 and his ability to anchor innings under pressure highlight his value as both a batsman and a leader.Ricky Ponting, who led Australia in 229 ODIs, secured two World Cup titles and maintained a dominant 62.33% win rate, cementing his status as the gold standard of Australian ODI leadership.Steve Waugh (71.92% win rate) and Michael Clarke (51.06%) also played pivotal roles in Australia’s World Cup successes.Allan Border, though possessing a lower win percentage (34.40%), was instrumental in transforming Australia’s cricketing ethos, leading them to their first-ever World Cup victory in 1987.Smith's leadership tenure was disrupted by off-field controversies, including the 2018 ball-tampering scandal, which affected his legacy.While he may not be ranked among the absolute greats like Ponting or Waugh, his tactical acumen and steady leadership place him in the upper echelon of Australian ODI captains.","Steve Smith has retired from One-Day International (ODI) cricket.

Time to give KL Rahul his due,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/icc-champions-trophy-2025/time-to-give-kl-rahul-his-due/articleshow/118731758.cms,"What more can I do? 'Keeper-batter hits back at trolls after match-winning knock vs Australia

DUBAI: It's an incident which has gone viral, and it gives you a fair idea of to what extent KL Rahul can go to give his all, play any role for his team. Soon after Virat Kohli was dismissed for 84, caught at ling-on going for a big slog-sweep off Adam Zampa during India's 2025 ICC Champions Trophy semifinal against Australia at the Dubai International Stadium here on Tuesday night, KL Rahul expressed his disappointment at the batting great.Apparently, just as the gun pair had begun stitching a solid 47-run partnership in just 46 balls for the fifth wicket, Rahul had spelled out his plan to Kohli during a drinks interval, suggesting to the maestro to bat deep into the game, while he would take up the risky part and go for the big hits. ""Main maar raha that naa (I was going after the bowling),"" he told Kohli as he walked past him after being dismissed. Thankfully for India, Rahul held his nerve, remaining unbeaten on 42 off 34 balls, finishing off the match with a glorious six in the first ball of the 49th over to help India enter their fifth Champions Trophy final.Switching effortlessly to the No 6 spot, where he's making finishing games a regular habit, Rahul has produced a flawless show so far-106 runs in four matches@106.00, forcing his critics, who feel that Test star Rishabh Pant should be there instead of him, eat a humble pie. Before the semis clash, Rahul had confessed to the competition with Pant, saying: ""I won't lie about it.""Those who pitch for Pant at the expense of Rahul tend to forget the 32-year-old's wonderful record in the middle order. Before being moved down, Rahul enjoyed a wonderful record at the No 5 spot, where he averages a cool 56.47, with a strike rate of 96.36 (his overall average is 48.53, with his strike rate being 88.03) in that position, higher than anyone else with a minimum of 20 innings, since Jan 16, 2020 when he first began playing there. In India's run to the final of the 2023 ODI World Cup, he stroked 452 runs in 11 matches@75.33, with one hundred and two fifties, at a strike rate of 90.76.Even though he has lost his India spot in the T20Is, Rahul's record in ODI tournaments tell you that he is worth his weight in gold: In the World Cups and Asia Cups, he averages 58.07, and in the Champions Trophy he clocks 106.00.Mind blowing numbers for a player whose spot in the XI has been questioned every time.Speaking after his semifinal heroics, Rahul bared his heart on his position in the Indian team, his insecurities, and the criticism he faces from trolls on social media. He mentioned that he had never shied away from delivering whatever was asked of him. ""What more could I realistically do for the Indian team?"" Rahul asked.Indeed, like his namesake, batting legend and former India head coach Rahul Dravid , the 32-year-old has played all the tough roles in the Indian team, from opening the innings in the Test series against Australia to wicketkeeping and playing the finisher's role at No 6 in the ODIs, where he now bats even below Axar Patel, just to enable Team India to have better balance in their XI.""I was opening in Test matches in Australia, and you know how tough it is to face those deliveries. Coming from there to bat in the middle order here is a bit different, but I don't complain. This is how I've played my white-ball cricket for the last 4-5 years. I am quite used to moving up and down the order. I am just happy to play wherever I am asked, and it has helped me understand my game a lot better. Over the last year, it has also helped me improve my boundary-hitting,"" the batter told JioHotstar after the match.""Since 2020, I've been batting at No. 5. People forget that this is where I've been playing. Every time I perform in a series, and there's a break from ODI cricket, when the next series comes around, there's a question mark about 'where will he play in the XI?' Sometimes, I sit in the dressing room and think, 'What more can I do?' Everywhere I've been asked to play, I've played, and I feel like I've performed well, as per what Rohit has told me,"" Rahul added.After India's semifinal triumph, India's head coach Gautam Gambhir complimented Rahul for sizzling at the No 6 spot as well. ""You know in a sport like cricket and in a team sport, numbers don't matter, batting positions don't matter, it's the impact that matters. You should only be thinking of picking yourself in the playing 11 and rest whatever is needed of you to do it for the team you should be happily doing it and KL has done that and KL has done that really happily and he's done that really well at number six as well,"" Gambhir said.The coach explained that the decision to push Rahul to the No 6 slot has helped the team achieve more depth in the batting order. ""People keep talking about it, I don't know for how long they've been talking about it, why we've pushed KL at number six. Just we feel that he gives us more depth, and that is how we want to play the game. And the conversations which I've had with him or the conversations which I've had with everyone is exactly the same that in a team sport, especially in cricket and in this format, we are not going to talk about batting positions. We're going to talk about how we can create that impact and what is needed of the team. We'll continue doing that,"" he said.","KL Rahul hits back at trolls after match-winning knock vs Australia.

Gautam Gambhir hits out at critics after India beat Australia to reach Champions Trophy final

India's unbeaten run in the ongoing Champions Trophy has taken them within a win of lifting the trophy, as Rohit Sharma & Co defeated Australia by four wickets in the first semifinal on Tuesday in Dubai .The dominant nature of India's run has convinced former fast bowler S Sreesanth that they will win the title irrespective of whether they play South Africa or New Zealand in the final on March 9.India's opponents will be decided on Wednesday at the end of the second semifinal between the Proteas and the BlackCaps.""Doesn't matter who the opponents are in the final, India are going to win,"" Sreesanth said while talking to PTI.""There is so much positive energy. They are playing some wonderful cricket. The way Virat Kohli anchors the chase, the way Shreyas Iyer has stepped up -- let's just keep our fingers crossed.""Kohli led India's chase of 264 against Australia with a knock of 84 that won him the 'Man of the Match' award.Before this, Kohli scored an unbeaten century in India's win over Pakistan during the group stage of the tournament, where India also defeated Bangladesh and New Zealand.""Let's be humble in our process. That's what Mahi bhai (MS Dhoni) used to say -- one of the best captains I've played with,"" said Sreesanth, who was part of India's 2007 T20 World Cup and 2011 ODI World Cup-winning teams.""Even Sourav Ganguly used to say the same. Dada always used to say, let's be humble and trust the process. That's exactly what the Indian team is doing...

Aston Villa

get rare away win

A brilliant strike by Brahim Diaz propelled Real Madrid to a 2-1 win against local adversary Atletico in their Champions League round of 16 first-leg encounter on Tuesday.The 15-time European champions have consistently held the upper hand against Atletico, who have managed just three victories in 11 UEFA competition encounters. Real Madrid had previously triumphed over Atletico in both their Champions League final meetings.A decisive moment of individual skill settled the tense match in the Spanish capital. Diaz secured Real Madrid's victory by manoeuvring past several Atletico defenders before placing a precise low shot into the far corner in the 55th minute.Atletico Madrid, under Diego Simeone, faced another disappointment against their city rivals, following previous final defeats in 2014 and 2016. They had also suffered eliminations in the knockout stages during the 2015 quarterfinals and 2017 semifinals.At their home ground, Santiago Bernabeu stadium, Real Madrid opened the scoring through Rodrygo's skilful effort. After receiving the ball on the wing, he moved into the penalty area, outpaced the defenders and placed a precise shot into the net.Atletico's patient approach yielded results in the 32nd minute through Julian Alvarez's remarkable effort. The striker received possession on the left side, moved into the box and executed a brilliant curling shot beyond Thibaut Courtois, marking his seventh goal in the competition this season.Arsenal, making their Champions League comeback following a six-year hiatus, initially struggled before Jurrien Timber headed in against the flow of play, moments after PSV struck the frame of the goal.The visitors subsequently took control of the match, establishing a three-goal advantage within thirty minutes.Young talent Ethan Nwaneri, aged 17, extended the lead in the 21st minute following precise team coordination in the penalty area. Mikel Merino subsequently capitalised on PSV's defensive disarray, scoring the third goal after multiple unsuccessful clearance attempts.Prior to the interval, Thomas Partey's unnecessary challenge on Luuk de Jong inside the penalty area provided PSV an opportunity, which Noa Lang successfully converted.Following the break, PSV's defence deteriorated. Arsenal's skipper Martin Odegaard netted twice, whilst Leandro Trossard and Riccardo Calafiori contributed additional goals to secure a comprehensive victory.Borussia Dortmund , who finished second last season, find themselves in a balanced position against Lille following the first leg's 1-1 stalemate, with Hakon Arnar Haraldsson securing the equaliser for the French side.The German team had taken the lead when Karim Adeyemi struck from distance with a precise shot in the 22nd minute, but Canadian striker Jonathan David's precise pass split the Dortmund defence in the 68th minute, allowing Haraldsson to score and restore parity.Aston Villa overcame their struggles in away matches to win 3-1, while also benefiting from an own goal by Club Brugge .The decisive moment occurred in the 82nd minute when Club Brugge's Brandon Mechele inadvertently directed the ball past his own goalkeeper with the score level at 1-1. His attempt to block Morgan Rogers' cross resulted in the ball finding its way into his own net.The hosts, visibly affected by the own goal, subsequently conceded a penalty which substitute Marco Asensio successfully converted.Prior to that, the Belgian team had displayed strong performance, dominated possession and generated superior opportunities in the second half.Villa's previous away record had been concerning, with two losses in the group stages of this competition, including one at Club Brugge. Their Premier League away performance also shows seven defeats in 13 matches.Villa conceded an early advantage when Leon Bailey found the net within three minutes of kickoff. Club Brugge responded swiftly, equalising just two minutes later. A long pass caught Villa's defence off guard, allowing Christos Tzolis to penetrate the box. His precise cut-back found Maxim De Cuyper unmarked, who struck cleanly with his left foot past Emiliano Martinez into the distant corner.",Real Madrid beat Atletico 2-1 in Champions League round of 16 first leg. Brahim Diaz's brilliant strike secured Real Madrid's victory. Aston Villa overcame their struggles in away matches to win 3-1.

NAVI MUMBAI: Honey Thaljieh knows the road she has travelled. Right from when she was a seven-year-old girl who would often pass by a group of boys playing football in the streets of occupied Bethlehem .One day, the boys invited her to join them and her skills caught the eye. It was just a humble beginning to a lifelong bond with the 'beautiful game'. One that would see Thaljieh become a co-founder and the first captain of the Palestine women's national foot ball team. One that would help her shatter stereotypes about Arab women playing sport.Football has indeed paved the way for Thaljieh to accomplish goals way beyond the imagination of that innocent seven-year-old girl whose footwork left the boys impressed that day. ""I grew up in such a context where I only wanted an opportunity and football gave it to me,"" Thaljieh tells TOI.It even helped her secure a professional career. For the past 13 years, Thaljieh has been working in Fifa 's public relations team. It's a role that has taken her around the globe, and brought her to India now for the third time.And wherever Thaljieh goes about her business, be it championing the causes of equality and inclusion, or promoting social development initiatives, she feels a sense of joy. A joy from being the influential figure she missed having in her life as a young Palestinian girl growing up in a hostile region.""Everywhere I go, it reminds me of my own story,"" Thaljieh says, shortly after delivering a talk to Pillai College students here in celebration of International Women's Day. ""Everywhere I am involved in projects, whether with girls, with boys, disadvantaged groups, slums, refugee areas, villages, all these disadvantaged groups at all levels, it reminds me where I come from. And that's where I find joy, because I strive to be the kind of influence I wished I had as a young Palestinian girl growing up in a challenging environment. I believe that every child deserves access to sports, and it should be recognized as a fundamental right.""On what is her second visit to the city, Thaljieh has been busy. From giving a lecture at the 6th edition of the Pillai Fifa CIES Programme in sports management and interacting with local students, to taking part in a friendly football game with girls from Slum Soccer - an NGO dedicated to uplifting underprivileged youth, she continues trying to bring about change.""I want to share my story with young girls to inspire change in their lives, because it's not acceptable that we still have children living under poverty,"" says Thaljieh who was also honoured by Soroptimist International, an organisation advocating for human rights and gender equality. ""I want a better world where opportunities are for everyone, regardless of their background, nationality, ethnicity, or religion.""Those words make you wonder about the plight of her own people, who continue to suffer the devastating consequences of the war in Gaza. ""The situation in Palestine has not been a recent development, it is part of a long-standing fight for equality, justice, and freedom since 1948,"" Thaljieh, who is based in Zurich, points out. ""I come from a land that should be synonymous with peace, yet it is mired in conflict. This drives my mission to advocate for justice and equality, as we strive to be recognised and respected as human beings with basic rights that everyone deserves. And that's why I chose football - to fight injustices, to fight inequalities.""It may not alter the immediate circumstances of her people, she concedes, but then Thaljieh is best placed to appreciate how powerful a tool, sport and football can be in transforming lives. ""Football can change the narrative of the Palestinian people. Football put us on the map,"" she says.""Yes, it's not going to change the immediate situation and bring freedom to Palestinian people in Gaza, the West Bank, or people from any war-torn place, but it empowered me to be here today and speak about justice and equality and freedom for all people.""",Honey Thaljieh is a co-founder and the first captain of the Palestine women's national foot ball team.

NEW DELHI: FIFA, the international governing body for football, has lifted the suspension imposed on the Pakistan Football Federation ( PFF ) after the necessary constitutional amendments were implemented to ensure proper governance of the sport in the country.The suspension was initially imposed on February 5 due to the failure of PFF Congress members to amend the constitution as required by FIFA.However, on Thursday, the PFF Congress members reached a consensus and approved the necessary amendments to the constitution. A PFF official confirmed that FIFA informed them on Sunday that the suspension had been lifted.Since June 2019, Pakistan's football affairs have been overseen by a FIFA-appointed normalization committee, tasked with conducting elections and resolving disputes between parallel factions.Despite multiple changes in the committee's leadership over the past five years, the core issues facing Pakistani football remained unresolved.Last week, a senior official from the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) visited Lahore to persuade Congress members to adopt the required constitutional amendments.The changes were approved at a meeting in Lahore, paving the way for FIFA to lift the suspension.With the suspension lifted, Pakistan will now be eligible to participate in the 2027 AFC Asian Cup qualifiers .

Barcelona playmaker Pedri Gonzalez nearly capitalized on a mistake from Sociedad goalkeeper Alex Remiro, but his deflection landed just over the net. The game’s defining moment came in the 17th minute when Elustondo was sent off for pulling down Dani Olmo , who was racing through on goal.Barcelona took advantage quickly, opening the scoring eight minutes later when Olmo floated a cross to Martin, who fired home his first-ever senior goal. Four minutes later, Olmo was involved again—his wayward shot deflecting off Casado and into the net for Barcelona’s second. The young Lamine Yamal continued to impress, setting up Pedri, whose shot from the edge of the box was saved. Pedri came even closer after halftime, rattling the crossbar from distance.Shortly after, Araujo made it 3-0, reacting quickest after Remiro parried Lewandowski’s header from a corner. Lewandowski then wrapped up the scoring with a clever finish, diverting Araujo’s low drive past the goalkeeper. The 36-year-old now leads the La Liga scoring charts with 21 goals in 25 appearances.Barcelona controlled the final 30 minutes without much trouble, though substitute Ferran Torres came close to adding a fifth goal twice. Real Sociedad defender Javi Lopez admitted the red card changed the course of the game.Elsewhere, Valencia salvaged a 3-3 draw at Osasuna, thanks to a stunning backheel volley from Umar Sadiq in the 87th minute. The Nigerian striker scored twice to earn his side a valuable point in the relegation battle. Valencia, now 18th, sit one point above Alaves, who drew 1-1 at Mallorca earlier in the day. In another crucial result, Leganes (16th) edged Getafe 1-0, moving three points clear of the drop zone.Barcelona now shift focus to their Champions League last-16 first leg against Benfica on Wednesday, as they look to continue their pursuit of silverware across all competitions.","Barcelona beat Real Sociedad 4-0 to reclaim top spot in La Liga.

Emma Raducanu revealed she experienced severe emotional distress, unable to see clearly or breathe properly when she noticed a man who was intensely focused on her during a match.The British tennis star, who won the 2021 US Open, became upset during her match at the Dubai Championships last month due to the presence of this individual in the stands.The spectator, who had previously approached Raducanu during the tournament, was removed from the venue after she alerted the chair umpire during her second-round match against Karolina Muchova .Dubai police subsequently detained the individual, who signed an agreement to maintain distance from Raducanu. The WTA confirmed the person displayed obsessive behaviour.Speaking to British journalists at the BNP Paribas Open in Indian Wells, her first competition since the event, Raducanu described her distress.""I saw him in the first game of the match and I was like, I don't know how I'm going to finish'. I literally couldn't see the ball through tears. I could barely breathe. I was like, I need to just take a breather here'.""Despite continuing after the individual's removal, Raducanu lost 7-6 6-4.She explained that her post-match emotional response wasn't primarily due to the defeat.Speaking to the BBC, Raducanu acknowledged that while the situation could have been handled more effectively, security measures have been enhanced.""I'm always now very aware and not necessarily doing things on my own any more. I'm always with someone and always being watched,"" Raducanu told the BBC.Previously in 2022, authorities issued a restraining order against an obsessive supporter who visited her residence three times.Raducanu is scheduled to compete against Japan's Moyuka Uchijima, ranked 52nd globally, three positions above her, in Thursday's first round in California. The victor will face third-seeded Coco Gauff , as the top 32 players receive automatic advancement to round two.","Emma Raducanu reveals she experienced severe emotional distress when she noticed a man who was intensely focused on her during a match.

WTA Merida Open

Mérida:

World number four Jessica Pegula powered to her first WTA title of 2025 on Sunday, beating McCartney Kessler 7-5, 6-2 in an all-American final in Austin, Texas.Pegula, the top seed, claimed a seventh WTA title and her first since she won the 1000 event in Toronto last year.That was one of Pegula's two titles in a 2024 campaign in which she also reached the US Open final.In Kessler she stopped a fast-rising talent, whose first two WTA finals had yielded a pair of titles -- in Cleveland last August and at Hobart in January.The 25-year-old arrived in Austin riding high after claiming her first career top-10 player with an upset of Coco Gauff in the second round at Dubai.But she couldn't find a way past Pegula, who snapped a three-match losing streak in finals for a confidence-building crown heading into the prestigious hard court tournaments at Indian Wells and Miami.Pegula, the only top-10 player in the draw, dropped just one set all week.Kessler looked set to change that when she rallied from 0-2 down to take a 4-2 lead in the first set.But too many unforced errors from Kessler allowed Pegula to get back in front and after Kessler missed a chance to break in the 11th game she was broken in the next as Pegula pocketed the first set.Kessler broke Pegula to open the second, but Pegula won the next four games to seize control.Top-seeded American Emma Navarro capped a dominant week with a 6-0, 6-0 thrashing of qualifier Emiliana Arango in the final of the WTA Merida Open on Sunday.Navarro, seeded No. 1 for the first time, marched to her second WTA title without dropping a set, adding the 500-level crown to the title she won in Hobart last year.Navarro hadn't reached a final since, although she made it to the quarter-finals or better at the last three Grand Slams and came into the week ranked 10th in the world.She needed just 55 minutes to subdue Arango, becoming the first player to win a WTA final 6-0, 6-0 since Iga Swiatek blanked Karolina Pliskova in the 2021 Rome title match.Arango, a 24-year-old Colombian who made it past the quarter-finals of a WTA tournament for the first time this week, came into the tournament ranked 133rd in the world and will crack the top 100 when the new rankings are announced on Monday.","Jessica Pegula wins WTA title in Austin, Texas.

DUBAI: The US Open's decision to cut and change the draw of its mixed-doubles event has divided the locker-room on the men's and women's tours. The Open's plan is to reschedule mixed-doubles as a standalone feature during the qualifying draw, tossing out $1 million in prize-money.This year's mixed-doubles event in New York, perhaps inspired by the vibe of last year's 'Mixed Madness' mela, will feature 16 pairs as against the 32 that make up mixed-doubles draws at Grand Slams. It will be played on August 19-20, three days before the start of the main draw. The qualification process has also been changed, with eight teams earning direct entry courtesy their combined singles ranking, while the other eight teams will be wildcard entries. Rohan Bopanna , still going strong in doubles at almost 45 years, said it was a lost opportunity for doubles specialists, who look forward to playing two events in Grand Slams -- doubles and mixed doubles. ""I don't think any doubles players can really play the mixed doubles. This year's US Open will be the first Grand Slam where we are not playing two events,"" Bopanna told TOI on the sidelines of the Dubai Duty Free Tennis championships here.Bopanna believes doubles is still a popular option for singles players on the ATP Tour. ""All the guys who enjoy doubles play doubles on the circuit,"" Bopanna said. ""The system is such that you can use singles ranking to get into doubles, on the ATP Tour you see a bunch of guys playing doubles and they enjoy it.""Yuki Bhambri, the India No.2 in the individual doubles ranking, said the USTA knew exactly what they were doing when they wrung in the changes. ""Grand Slams especially have always talked about tradition, that's why they never want to shorten matches,"" he said. ""They do that when it suits them, obviously business over (other) interests. The mixed doubles for a lot of countries like Great Britain, India and Australia has been a source of Grand Slam achievement. You're never going to get an opportunity like that with what they've done.""""You're essentially having the singles guys play a practice week,"" the 32-year-old Bhambri said, adding, ""It is obviously a sad day and a loss for a lot of the doubles players. We've all spoken about that, everyone is aware of what they've done and how they've gone about it.""Last year's Mixed Madness exhibition event before the start of the main draw saw a number of high-profile singles players pairing up. American Coco Gauff said she wouldn't be playing the mixed event this time even though she enjoyed being a part of Mixed Madness last year. ""It's an interesting situation because (on one side) some (players) rely on mixed doubles and it's an event that's been there forever. On the other hand, I know they're trying to get more singles players involved, maybe grow the sport,"" Gauff said, ""I most likely won't be participating just because it's not a great time for me, it will take away from the preparation for US Open.""",The US Open has cut and changed the draw of its mixed-doubles event.

Stefanos Tsitsipas secured his first title in nearly a year by defeating Felix Auger-Aliassime 6-3, 6-3 in the Dubai final on Saturday.""There is nothing that ensured the win today, it was just pure fighting,"" said Tsitsipas after winning in one hour and 28 minutes.The Greek player ended his unsuccessful run in ATP 500-level finals with this victory.While Tsitsipas has previously won the season-ending ATP Finals and top-tier ATP 1000 events, he had lost all 11 of his previous finals at 500 tournaments, including two defeats in Dubai to Roger Federer in 2019 and Novak Djokovic in 2020.""It's a big relief that I'm able to hold that trophy after the third attempt. It's something that I had in the back of my mind, and I'm happy to say I accomplished it.""Unseeded Canadian Auger-Aliassime entered the match with the momentum, having won tournaments in Adelaide in January and Montpellier in February.""I had a great opponent on the other side of the net, I knew it was a difficult task. I'm just proud of the way I managed the pressure and was able to perform in those crucial moments.""Tsitsipas controlled the match from the baseline and maintained his serve throughout, despite facing break points twice in each set.He broke the Canadian's serve in the seventh and ninth games of the first set, and secured the decisive break in the eighth game of the second set.Tsitsipas, who had fallen from world No.3 in early 2023 to 11th place, will climb to ninth when the ATP rankings update on Monday.""These are the things we are fighting for as professional tennis players. To be owning a spot in the top 10 is definitely one of the greatest feelings a tennis player can experience. It comes with hard work and sacrifices, but I'm happy that I'm in a position where I can really celebrate.""",Stefanos Tsitsipas beats Felix Auger-Aliassime in Dubai final.

DUBAI: The thread running through Stefanos Tsitsipas ’ run at the Dubai Duty Free tennis championship this week has been his fight, not the lack of it. The gifted Greek appeared lost on the court for most part of the last couple of years, and it gradually reflected on his ranking which dipped out of the top-10 for the first time in five years last Feb.The 26-year-old backed himself with successive three set wins over Karen Khachanov and Matteo Berrettini to make the last-four here, his first ATP 500 semis since last July. Tsitsipas then beat Dutchman Tallon Griekspoor 6-4, 6-4 to make the final, where he meets Felix Auger-Aliassime .""The ability to fight is the most important one for an athlete, once you lose that, you are useless on the court,"" Tsitsipas said. ""There is no match without fighting, you have to fight. The best victories are the ones you fought for. You’re not in control (of the match) and you somehow find that little gap and you win the match, that’s the most thrilling moment a tennis player can experience.""You feel a little lost, not that confident with certain things that you have done to your game,"" Tsitsipas said of the road back. ""It’s difficult to fake the confidence. It helps if you win, and you see yourself in the level that you are kind of imagining in your mind. That brings you confidence.""The World No.11 – a six-time Grand Slam semifinalist, and twice finalist at Roland Garros (2021) and Australian Open (2023) – rued the lost opportunity of seasons gone. ""I wish I had more of those matches where I fought and came back and won,"" he said. ""There were not enough of those moments in 2024. I need to recreate those moments.""Not unsurprisingly, the Tsitsipas corner wears a different look these days. Tsitsipas’ father Apostolos, a disruptive presence at courtside, was his longtime coach until the 6-feet-4 pro announced in Aug that he wouldn’t be working with his father any longer and introduced his new coach Dimitris Chatzinikolaou , the Greek Davis Cup captain.","Stefanos Tsitsipas is through to the final of the Dubai Duty Free tennis championship.

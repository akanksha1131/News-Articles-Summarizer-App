Poll Will the experience of winning the T20 World Cup in 2024 impact Rohit's approach in the 2027 ODI World Cup? Yes, it will positively influence him No, past experiences do not matter It depends on the team's dynamics

NEW DELHI: In a stunning and deeply personal revelation, former India captain Rohit Sharma has admitted that he contemplated walking away from cricket altogether after India's crushing loss to Australia in the final of the 2023 ODI World Cup in Ahmedabad.Speaking at a Masters' Union event on Sunday, Rohit laid bare the emotional toll of the defeat, describing a period when the sport he loved felt like it had “taken everything” out of him.“After the 2023 World Cup final, I was completely distraught and felt like I didn't want to play this sport anymore because it had taken everything out of me and I felt I had nothing left,” Rohit said.India, under Rohit's leadership, had enjoyed a near-perfect campaign at home, storming into the final with ten straight wins. But in the match that mattered most, Australia executed their plans to perfection. After India were restricted to 240, Travis Head's match-winning century guided the Pat Cummins-led side to a six-wicket victory, leaving a stunned Narendra Modi Stadium in silence.Rohit said the pain was amplified by the sheer emotional investment he had made since taking over the captaincy in 2022.“Everybody was extremely disappointed, and we just couldn't believe what had happened. It was a very tough time for me personally because I had put everything into that World Cup — not just two or three months before it, but ever since I became captain.”The 38-year-old admitted it took months to recover mentally. “There was no energy left in my body. It took me a couple of months to recover and bring myself back,” he said, adding that self-reflection and a reminder of his love for the game helped him find his way back.That resilience would soon define the next chapter. Less than a year after the Ahmedabad heartbreak, Rohit led India to the T20 World Cup title in the USA and West Indies, a triumph he described as a lesson in resetting after disappointment.“I knew life doesn't end there. It was a big lesson — how to deal with disappointment, reset, and start fresh,” Rohit said. “It's very easy to say this now, but at that moment, it was extremely difficult.”Though he has since retired from Tests and T20Is and no longer captains the ODI side, Rohit continues in the 50-over format, with one final dream still driving him — a last shot at World Cup glory in 2027.","Rohit Sharma admits he contemplated quitting cricket after India's 2023 ODI World Cup loss to Australia.

Inside story of why Shubman Gill was DROPPED from India T20I World Cup squad

Poll Do you believe Pakistan can recreate India's recent white-ball cricket success? Yes, with the right strategies. No, it will take more time.

Senior Pakistan selector and National Cricket Academy head Aaqib Javed has made a candid revelation, admitting that he has closely followed India's recent success in white-ball cricket in an effort to rebuild and strengthen Pakistan's own cricketing structure.Speaking on a Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) podcast, the former fast bowler said India's sustained dominance across tournaments offered clear lessons for any cricketing nation serious about long-term success. “I have looked at India's success and have tried to execute plans for the betterment of Pakistan cricket,” Aaqib said. “Any cricket nation's success is based on the quality of its talent.”India have enjoyed a golden run in recent years, winning the T20 World Cup in the Caribbean last year, the Champions Trophy in Dubai earlier this year, and the Asia Cup in September — a tournament where they defeated Pakistan in the final. Aaqib believes such consistency stems from systems rather than individuals.“I think we fell away in doing the basic things correctly in our cricket system,” Aaqib admitted. “No matter who you appoint as captain, coach or selector, unless you have quality talent, nothing changes.”He stressed that talent development depends on strong infrastructure and competition. “Quality of talent can be assured by increasing bench strength and competition, and this is only possible with proper infrastructure and system,” he said.Despite past shortcomings, Aaqib expressed optimism about the current direction of Pakistan cricket. Looking ahead to the T20 World Cup early next year in India and Sri Lanka, he said the timing could not be better. “Indications are all there. We have good players, they have combined well and importantly there is a choice of players now.”He added that playing all their matches in Sri Lanka would work in Pakistan's favour. “If the World Cup had been in Australia or South Africa, I would have thought differently. But this is the best time for the team to do well.”Aaqib also highlighted the growing depth in domestic cricket and the Pakistan Shaheens setup, claiming “three to four players are ready” for international cricket. However, he emphasised that modern talent goes beyond skill alone. “Nowadays, talent is also about mental strength because players are constantly under scrutiny.”Addressing criticism, Aaqib was blunt. “The criticism is an aftershock; it only comes after a poor performance. Why should I mind it?” he said. “The only way you can avoid being criticised is to do well.”",Aaqib Javed admits he has followed India's recent success in white-ball cricket in an effort to rebuild and strengthen Pakistan's own cricketing structure.

The Inside Story Behind India’s World Cup Win: Shafali & Deepti Reveal WPL'S IMPACT

Life is hectic for you these days, after India’s World Cup win...

You made it to the World Cup final in 2017 but lost, so this kind of public adulation has taken a while to arrive...

How different is your public life after the World Cup win?

If you had to choose only one thing that makes this team special, what would it be and why?

How did the dressing-room atmosphere change as this tournament progressed?

You performed in crunch situations, so hopefully you’ve banished the demons of 2017 and that infamous no-ball against South Africa in 2022...

You are always handed the ball in the toughest of situations...

What was your favourite wicket in this whole World Cup campaign?

Is there any particular process that you follow to handle pressure?

Jemimah Rodrigues spoke openly about battling stress and mental pressure after her great innings in the semifinal. Is there anybody in the team set-up you go to when you feel you are under pressure?

When you started playing, women’s matches weren’t shown live on TV. Who were your idols?

Your batting strike rates have improved a lot in recent times. How have you been training towards that?

You are a DSP (in the UP Police). What do you want to tell youngsters about maintaining balance in life beyond the cricket field?

Tell us more about the dressing room. At the World Cup, it looked more like a sisterhood than a team...

How do you destress? Do you have any favourite hobbies?

Why did you move to Bengal from UP in domestic cricket?

Is it time to treat women’s cricket in isolation, and not always compare it with the men’s team?

You are from Agra, which tends to produce so many quality women cricketers...

Kahaan baithoon? Yahaan? Yahaan? Ya wahaan (Where do I sit? Here? Here or there)?” Women’s Cricket World Cup Player of the Tournament Deepti Sharma is in a mild tizzy, a picture of confused, mock irritation, all of it in good humour. She can’t decide which chair to occupy, with her room in an upscale city hotel having been taken over by us— armed with camera, tripod, recorder, the works. Yes, the day’s newspaper too, for she is our Guest Sports Editor.As she is still figuring out her best position for the cameras, she decides it’s best to look at the options as fielding positions. “That’s silly point, this one’s short leg,” she mutters to herself, immediately narrowing down the field.“Which one would you prefer?”“Silly point, any time,” says the allrounder. “Short leg pey ball bahut aati hai, aur bahut tez aati hai (the ball comes a lot to you at short leg, and at great pace too),” she says with eyebrow-raised, wide-eyed wonder, as if letting you in on a state secret.Time is short, the deadline’s looming and despite Deepti stealing a glance at her watch every now and then, she has broken the ice and set the tone for an interesting chat.It’s not every day that we have a women’s World Cup winner in our midst. Excerpts...Yes. (But) it feels good. I’m enjoying this a lot because I haven’t experienced this kind of life before. Now, we’re busy with events and shows. It feels like life abhi shuru hui hai (my actual life has begun now).As a team, we’ve been patient. That’s been our hallmark. We believe that things happen only when they are meant to happen. I keep reminding myself about that.We made sure we didn’t let our hard work go waste. We always had one goal—to win the Cup. It has come after so long. It was scripted that it had to happen in India. We just supported each other, didn’t think about the big things that could follow.It’s very different now. Now, they recognize me very easily. From the time I board a flight to the time I get off and make it to the car outside, people are crazy about clicking selfies with me. After the 2017 World Cup, people started to get to know the names of India’s women cricketers. Now, life has gone to the next level.Recently in Mumbai, we had gone to have tea and vada pav . I was wearing a mask but the shopkeeper recognized me. He refused to take money when I was about to pay. He said the tea and food were a gift from him. I insisted on paying but he said, “You are doing good things for the country and you have recently won the World Cup. We don’t want your money.” This made me very happy.We never give up. We learn from every match. For instance, we couldn’t win the 2017 World Cup final but we learned a lot from it. We learned how to perform well as a team and handle pressure situations. We learnt where we are behind and how far we have to go. We told ourselves we have to be one of the best teams. We focus on what we have to achieve as a team. We always think that we have to fight till the very last ball.We knew we were playing on home soil. That has its own pressures, playing in front of friends and families and fans. (But) we were not nervous. We started the tournament well. The dressingroom atmosphere was a bit up and down after the defeats to South Africa and England. We learned a lot from that. We sat down in the dressing room and had discussions. We talked about where we were making mistakes. We learnt how to come back. We did not want to beat ourselves up thinking we had lost. Everyone had good morale even after those two defeats.I think God sends you to this world for tough situations. When I initially started playing for Uttar Pradesh, I played one tough innings where wickets were tumbling at the other end and I had to hold on to mine. That match changed my mindset forever. I understood how to play with my partner in any given situation. This time, it was my dream to qualify for the semifinals after the struggle in the group games. I wanted to contribute to the team. I was carrying the learning from previous memories, be it the no-ball or the 2017 World Cup final. It’s easy to sulk about bad things. I choose to see how I can emerge better from them.I feel building trust with the captain is important. I always want to maintain that trust. Harry di (captain Harmanpreet Kaur ) always supports me at every point. She also gives me the freedom to bowl with any plan I have. No matter what situation you bowl in, you just have to know which areas you want to bowl in. I bowl in all three phases, with both the new ball and the old. I know how to get the batter out.It’s difficult to choose one. I’ll pick two. One is dismissing Laura Wolvaardt in the final. The second is the last wicket (Nadine de Klerk) to win the World Cup. I have already seen that last-wicket video many times on loop. I haven’t seen any of my own videos so many times in my life (Laughs)!When we practice before the match, we practice the role we are going to play in the middle. If I have to bat at a particular number, I have a plan in mind to make it easy for me. If I have any doubts on the process to handle pressure, I discuss it with my brother. He always tells me to focus on the present and not think about what happened in the past or what is going to happen in the future.When I feel I need to talk to someone, say, if I don’t understand certain things or if I’m not getting results despite my best effort, I seek out Amol (Muzumdar, head coach) sir. He is always there. He is very close to us all.When I began watching cricket, I was a fan of Sachin (Tendulkar) and in particular, Suresh Raina . People say my batting style is similar to Raina’s. I like watching his batting videos. He was an outstanding fielder too, so that inspired me. Our idols came from men’s cricket. Now, youngsters will hopefully consider us their idols or favourites. It feels amazing.It’s simple — power-hitting with a heavy ball during training. You get an idea of how far you can hit when you play afterwards with a leather ball, which is a lot lighter. You can see the difference. Always work on your power hitting.You’ve to take one step at a time. If I’m a good human being, only then will I be able to do well at cricket. Even after playing for so many years, there has to be a commitment towards wearing the India jersey. You have to stay committed to not only playing for your country, but also to win big ones like the World Cup. The same works for life too.It’s a fun, relaxed place. Anyone can make fun of the other person. Whether it is Jemimah (Rodrigues), Harleen (Deol) or Radha (Yadav), they can mimic anyone in the dressing room. It keeps the dressing room in a good mood. We are very serious most of the time, but we enjoy the girls pulling each others’ legs.I like to listen to Hanuman bhajans before every match. In fact, I start the day with them. I also listen to Arijit Singh’s songs. I like them a lot. I like all types of music. I save bhajans in my browsing history, they keep playing on the loop.Jhulu di ( Jhulan Goswami ) and Sourav Ganguly requested me. They said they wanted me for Bengal, that was the only reason. It was a good experience playing under the legends of Indian cricket. I speak Bangla well now too.Earlier, only women cricket players supported the men’s team. This time, the men’s players were supporting us! Both (teams) are different and both should get the same importance. There have been a lot of changes, like in terms of pay parity. Thanks to BCCI, they have given women’s cricket the same importance as men’s cricket. WPL has also started. It has been a long wait for this.The special thing is that there is a lot of talent in Agra. When I started playing, there were two senior players who represented India for so many years. It was good learning experience for us.In Agra, young women and senior players always had the passion to play cricket and go to academies. There used to be very few academies earlier.I started playing at Ekalavya stadium. I have seen a lot of girls coming up from there. If you look at the domestic circuit, there are a lot of girls who are selected from Agra. It’s a good sign. There are so many girls and they get strong support from their families too.","Women's Cricket World Cup Player of the Tournament Deepti Sharma is our Guest Sports Editor.

Curious case! Why Ajit Agarkar & Co. continue to ignore Ishan Kishan

When Jharkhand players were deservingly celebrating with the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy at the MCA Stadium in Gahunje, two former India players looked at the frenzy from the sidelines. Saurabh Tiwary and Shahbaz Nadeem reluctantly joined the team for a picture with the trophy only upon skipper Ishan Kishan and his teammates’ insistence.It was 15 years ago, in 2011, when Jharkhand lifted a BCCI trophy when Tiwary’s team defeated a strong Parthiv Patel-led Gujarat by 159 runs in the Vijay Hazare final. The star of that match was Nadeem by taking four wickets in four overs in exchange for only six runs. He was deservedly declared player of the match. The duo is still doing their job of making their team win, albeit, in different capacities.The former players have now turned into full-time administrators, with Tiwary taking the Jharkhand Cricket Association’s secretary’s position and Nadeem managing the joint-secretary's role. “This trophy means a lot for us as it has come after a long time. I feel the credit goes to the players, the support staff for making this happen,” a visibly overwhelmed Tiwary said.“Hopefully, in the coming days, we will play many more finals in various formats,” he added.Nadeem said though the association was on the right track, significant changes have been made in the overall working and results will follow.“It isn't that Jharkhand didn’t reach the finals of important tournaments be fore. But there were some areas that nee ded improvement. I would say, we were 80 per cent there, but at this level, even 20 per cent matters a lot. Our aim is to work on that 20 per cent,” the former India left arm spinner said. “The team did not depend on any individual. Everybody played their part. We played as a strong team,” he added.He said the experience of their playing days helped them plan things better. “During our playing days, we found some things, facilities, lacking for players. We tried to fill in the gaps and will lo ok for more holes to fill,” he added.“I feel we have emphasized a lot on players’ freedom to express themselves in the matches. As far as the changes in the association are concerned, I feel the inclusion of multi-day formats in the age-group cricket has been vital. Earlier we had limited overs matches only, but we took this decision to start days cricket and I feel it was needed,” Nadeem said.When it is Jharkhand, Mahendra Singh Dhoni can’t be far from discussion. Nadeem said the former India skipper played an important role in boosting the team's morale and also gave suggestions to the association.“Before the season, when we were selecting the coaches, the support staff and selectors, MS bhai’s involvement was there. Be it women’s cricket, age group teams, he gave his inputs for each team,” Nadeem said.",Jharkhand lifted the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy at the MCA Stadium in Gahunje.

Fans throw objects, vandalise stadium after Messi leaves early | Hyderabad next

Former India captain Sourav Ganguly has taken legal action against Uttam Saha, the president of the Argentina Fan Club of Kolkata, by filing a defamation case seeking Rs 50 crore in damages. The move follows allegations made by Saha linking Ganguly to the controversy surrounding the chaotic Yuva Bharati Stadium event during Lionel Messi ’s visit to Kolkata on Saturday, December 13.The complaint, lodged at Lalbazar, states that Saha’s public remarks were baseless and caused serious damage to Ganguly’s reputation. Ganguly has termed the accusations “false, malicious, offensive and defamatory”, alleging that they were made with full knowledge of the harm they could cause to his public image.Currently serving as the president of the Cricket Association of Bengal, Ganguly clarified in his complaint that he had no official role in organising or managing the Messi event. He maintained that his presence at the stadium was strictly as an invited guest and that he had no involvement in the planning or execution of the programme.The legal action adds a new dimension to the fallout from Messi’s much-hyped visit to Kolkata, which descended into disorder and sparked widespread criticism.Ganguly’s complaint specifically challenges claims made by Saha that he acted as a middleman in the management of the event, which was overseen by its main organiser, Satadru Dutta.“Serious allegations are being made publicly without any factual basis,” Ganguly stated in his filing. His legal representatives have since issued a notice to Saha, demanding a retraction of the statements and compensation for the alleged damage caused.Following the chaos at the venue, event organiser Satadru Dutta was detained for questioning by authorities. West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee later issued a public apology on X, expressing regret over the mismanagement of the event and apologising to Lionel Messi as well as football fans in Kolkata who were unable to see the Argentine star properly.During the event at Yuva Bharati Stadium, Ganguly was present in a separate area of the venue. As the situation in the stands deteriorated, he was seen exiting the stadium, visibly disappointed by the turn of events.The Messi programme was widely criticised for poor planning and crowd control, leaving fans frustrated after paying hefty ticket prices in anticipation of a memorable experience. Instead, scenes of disorder dominated coverage, drawing national and international attention to shortcomings in the organisation of high-profile sporting events in India.The incident also revived debates around VIP culture at major sports functions. Reports and videos highlighted limited fan interaction with Messi, while officials and invited guests occupied the field area, further fuelling anger among supporters and adding to the backlash surrounding the event.",Sourav Ganguly has filed a defamation case against Uttam Saha.

NEW DELHI: With just 50 days to go for the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup in India and Sri Lanka, Team India’s numbers no longer scream dominance, even if recent results offer some comfort.As defending champions, India began their post 2024 title run in ruthless fashion, winning 17 of their next 20 T20Is. Nine scores crossed the 200 mark, five of them were 220 plus and three breached 245 mark, underlining a batting unit operating well ahead of the curve. That curve has flattened since the 2025 Asia Cup. India’s overall strike rate has dropped to 141.64, a worrying decline for a side that had redefined intent at the top of the order.Since the Asia Cup, Abhishek Sharma remains the only Indian batter striking above 145. Everyone else has slowed down, and the biggest talking point has shifted to the new opening combination. The Sanju Samson–Abhishek Sharma partnership set the tone for India’s surge after the 2024 World Cup. Across 13 innings, the pair scored at a run rate of 10.05 and averaged 25.38. That early momentum allowed India to sustain a strike rate of 154.56 through the middle overs and 169.39 at the death.The dynamic shifted when Shubman Gill returned to the playing XI as part of the management’s long-term leadership plan. Samson, who amassed 417 runs in 12 T20Is at a strike rate of 183.70 with three centuries at the top, was pushed down the order.His Asia Cup returns were mixed, though he still finished as India’s third highest run-getter with 132 runs, behind Abhishek Sharma’s 314 and Tilak Varma’s 213. A solitary outing in Australia at No. 3 ended without impact, after which Samson was dropped from the playing XI.Gill’s own returns since his comeback have been underwhelming. In 15 matches, he has scored 291 runs at an average of 24.25 and a strike rate of 137, without a single fifty. The numbers point to a batter searching for rhythm at a time when India’s top order needs clarity more than caution.Speaking at the JioStar Press Room ahead of the upcoming T20 World Cup, former India batter Robin Uthappa , who was part of the 2007 World Cup winning squad, was clear about the balance he wants to see. “I would not personally like to tinker with the opening combination,” JioStar expert Uthappa said. “What I would like is to see Sanju bat at No. 3, Tilak at No. 4 and Surya at No. 5. Suryakumar Yadav plays his best cricket outside the powerplay. Tilak Verma needs a pivotal role in this team and that is why No. 4 suits him.”Uthappa explained that placing Tilak Verma at No. 4 and Suryakumar Yadav at No. 5 would free up the top order. “This gives the openers and the No. 3 position the authority to go hard,” he said.He then addressed Gill’s role directly. “You can have someone like Shubman Gill play that sheet anchor role that India desperately need right now, so everyone else can play aggressively around him. India can still use the hyper aggressive batting template that has worked for them, while Gill bats at a 140 to 150 strike rate, which is where he thrives. It is similar to the role Virat Kohli played in the last T20 World Cup. ”The concerns, however, extend beyond Gill alone. India’s intent has also dipped due to Suryakumar’s prolonged lean patch. In 2025, the captain has scored just 213 runs from 20 matches at an average of 14.20 and a strike rate of 125.29. With both captain and vice-captain struggling for form, pressure has inevitably shifted on to the middle order.At the same interaction, former India all-rounder Irfan Pathan stressed that the phase of experimentation must now come to an end. “There has been a lot of talk about chopping and changing,” JioStar expert Pathan said. “I think the team management was trying to understand who can play different roles, but this is not the time to experiment. When the World Cup starts, it has to be very clear who is batting at what position.”That experimentation has been evident. In the last two T20I series against Australia and South Africa, India tried multiple options at No. 3, including Sanju Samson, Shivam Dube, Suryakumar Yadav, Tilak Varma and even Axar Patel.Pathan also did not hide his concern over Suryakumar’s form. “As a captain, you need to bat well and be in form going into a big tournament like the World Cup,” he said. “The concern is not just that he is not scoring runs, but that his strike rate is also going down. His strike rate is generally around 166, but over the last year it has come down to around 119.”Referring to Abhishek Sharma’s high risk approach at the top, Pathan said that such a style will inevitably lead to occasional early dismissals and that is acceptable. “He does not need to change,” Pathan said. “That is why he has been successful. But then the pressure comes on the middle order. When you have an in-form Suryakumar Yadav, it becomes a completely different game. Hopefully, he finds a way to stay a bit longer at the crease and get those runs before the World Cup. ”What Team India needs right now is certainty of roles. With the World Cup fast approaching, rediscovering tempo, fixing roles and getting their leaders back among the runs may matter far more than any tactical tweak.","Team India's numbers no longer scream dominance, even if recent results offer some comfort. India’s overall strike rate has dropped to 141.64, a worrying decline for a side that had redefined intent at the top of the order. The biggest talking point has shifted to the new opening combination.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126079854,imgsize-117706,width-400,resizemode-4/ind-vs-sa-5th-t20i-match.jpg"

NEW DELHI: India ended the T20I series against South Africa on a high by winning the fifth and final match and sealing the five-match series 3-1 on Friday at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad.With this win, India have managed to extend their unbeaten streak. They are now on a streak of 10 consecutive series wins (including major tournaments).With the 4th T20I in Lucknow being abandoned earlier because of heavy fog, everyone wanted to see a full game, and the players didn't disappoint at all.India put up a big total of 231 for 5 after South Africa won the toss and chose to bowl.The batting effort was led by Tilak Varma and Hardik Pandya . Tilak played a steady and attacking knock, scoring 73 runs off 42 balls.Hardik provided the late surge with a quick 63 off just 25 balls, hitting five 4s and five 6s. Sanju Samson and Abhishek Sharma also gave India a strong start at the top.Chasing 232, South Africa began well. Quinton de Kock was in fine form and attacked the Indian bowlers from the start. South Africa matched India’s Powerplay score and stayed in the hunt.When Dewald Brevis joined de Kock, the visitors picked up momentum. The pair played freely and took South Africa to 118 runs at the halfway mark, putting pressure back on the Indian side.At that point, the match seemed evenly balanced. That is when India captain Suryakumar Yadav turned to his most trusted bowler, Jasprit Bumrah . Bumrah made an immediate impact by dismissing de Kock with a sharp return catch. That wicket changed the game.South Africa suddenly lost their rhythm. From 120 for 1, they slipped to 135 for 5 in a short span.The middle order could not recover from the collapse. Varun Chakaravarthy added to South Africa’s problems with an impressive spell, picking up four wickets and breaking key partnerships.While Varun took the wickets, Bumrah’s spell stood out in a high-scoring match. He finished with excellent figures of 2 wickets for just 17 runs in his four overs, controlling the game when it mattered most.South Africa eventually finished on 201/8 in their 20 overs, falling 30 runs short of the target.With this victory, India won the match by 30 runs and closed the series 3-1. Hardik Pandya, who also took one wicket during his bowling, has been named the Man of the Match.",India beat South Africa by 30 runs in the fifth and final T20I in Ahmedabad.

India World Cup squad: No Shubman Gill, Jitesh as selectors recall Rinku, Ishan Kishan

Even before Pakistan had Imran Khan, Wasim Akram, Javed Miandad, or Shoaib Akhtar, it had Hanif Mohammad. Pakistan’s first great cricketer did not announce himself with power or speed, but with time. Lots of it. He built a team around the idea that you could refuse to lose.Hanif was Pakistan cricket’s first true star. At a time when the country was new and still finding its voice, he gave it one through the bat. His feats, heard across Pakistan on radio, took the game out of drawing rooms and college grounds and into streets, maidans, and homes. Cricket stopped being a pursuit of a small, educated elite and became a sport for everyone.Hanif Mohammad was born in 1934 in Gujarat, in undivided India. After Partition, his family moved to Pakistan, and so did his cricketing future. Hanif played 55 Tests, including Pakistan's first against India in 1952. He played for Pakistan across a career that lasted 17 years, scoring 3,915 runs at an average of 43.98. Those numbers matter, but they only tell part of the story. Hanif’s true value lay in what he represented and how he played.He was called the “Little Master”. He stood 5 feet 3 inches tall. When he first appeared in top-level cricket, he looked younger than his age and smaller than most around him. When he walked out to bat at Lahore in November 1951, during the first unofficial Test between Pakistan and MCC, he was only 16. It was his first-class debut.""He looked about 12, Brian Statham said, as cited by Wisden in its obituary of Hanif. By the end of the day, the joke had worn thin. Hanif made 26 in 165 minutes. In the very next match, he batted for over four hours to score 64 as Pakistan chased 288. That innings, quiet as it was, changed things. Eight months later, Pakistan were granted Test status.With Abdul Hafeez Kardar as captain and Fazal Mahmood leading the attack, Hanif was the one who held the innings together. Time and again, he stood between Pakistan and defeat, building long innings based on defence, judgment, and discipline.Nothing defines him better than the innings that still stands alone in cricket history. Bridgetown, 1957–58. Pakistan were touring the West Indies. West Indies made 579. Pakistan collapsed for 106 on the third day of what was a six-day match, and were asked to follow on, trailing by 473. Defeat was not a question of “if”, only “when”.Hanif reached 61 on stumps on Day 3, having endured Roy Gilchrist’s short-pitched assault, he chose not to hook. Over the next three days, Hanif batted. And batted. He added exactly 100 on the fourth day as Pakistan lost just one wicket. On the fifth day, he defied pain from thighs bruised by Gilchrist, and sunburn that caused the skin under his eyes to peel away. During intervals he would sit in a corner of the dressing room and eat a piece of chicken. By stumps he had 270, and Pakistan a small lead.He scored 337, batted for 970 minutes, and shared century partnerships with four players, including his brother Wazir. Pakistan declared on 657 for 8. The match was drawn. Hanif's innings remain the longest individual innings (by minutes) in Tests.A year later, Hanif showed that this was no one-off. Playing for Karachi against Bahawalpur in 1959, he scored 499 in a first-class match. It was the highest first-class score at the time. He was run out in the final over while trying for his 500th run. The record stood for 35 years, until Brian Lara made 501 for Warwickshire.That reputation sometimes reduced him to a caricature, but Hanif was more than a blocker. He could attack when required and is often credited as the originator of the reverse sweep. His skill set was wide. He captained Pakistan, kept wicket, and even bowled right- and left-handed in Test cricket. Yet, above all, he was a master of one thing: staying in.Hanif’s career was not without lean phases. His 1962 tour of England brought his first sustained run of low scores. He managed 177 runs in the series at an average of 17.70, with a highest score of 47.Five years later, nearing his mid-30s, he returned to England with a point to prove. English fast bowlers thought the short ball would trouble him. John Snow tested him repeatedly. Hanif answered with 187 not out in the first Test at Lord’s. It took 556 balls and the match was drawn.By the late 1960s, consistency became harder to maintain and Hanif decided to step away. He finished with 12 Test centuries and 15 fifties. His average, once above 47, settled at 43.98. He scored Test centuries against all opponents away from home, dismissing any idea that he was dependent on home conditions. His away average of 42.62 was close to his overall average in Tests.Hanif was also part of one of cricket’s most remarkable families. Three of his brothers — Wazir, Mushtaq and Sadiq — played Test cricket. Another brother, Raees, was once Pakistan’s twelfth man. In 1969–70, Hanif, Mushtaq and Sadiq played together against New Zealand at Karachi, Hanif’s final Test, echoing the Grace brothers’ feat for England in 1880. At least one brother featured in Pakistan’s first 89 Tests. His son Shoaib later played 45 Tests.Hanif Mohammad passed away on August 11, 2016, in Karachi, aged 81 years and 234 days. By then, Pakistan cricket had seen fast bowlers who terrified batters, captains who won world titles.But before Pakistan learned how to win, it learned how not to lose. That lesson came from Hanif Mohammad, who was born on this day (December 21) in 1934.","Hanif Mohammad was Pakistan cricket's first true star.

Inside story of why Shubman Gill was DROPPED from India T20I World Cup squad

NEW DELHI: Indian cricket legend Sunil Gavaskar shared some important advice for batter Shubman Gill after he was left out of India’s T20 World Cup 2026 squad.The decision came as a surprise to many fans, especially since Gill was also removed from the role of vice-captain.With Gill out, Axar Patel has been named India’s vice-captain for the T20 World Cup 2026.Sunil Gavaskar believes that Gill should accept this setback with maturity.Speaking on Star Sports, Gavaskar said, ""I hope Shubman takes this in the right spirit. I wish him the best. Some of his injuries have been strange.""Gavaskar felt that Gill still has a bright future, and this decision does not mean the end of his chances.Gavaskar also feels that chief selector Ajit Agarkar would have personally spoken to Gill to explain the reason behind the call.He said, ""Knowing Ajit Agarkar, I'm pretty sure he'll be on the phone to Shubman, trying to explain to him why they took the call that they did.""According to Gavaskar, the team management is trying to correct its earlier decisions. When Gill returned to the T20 squad, Sanju Samson was pushed down the batting order.Earlier, Samson and Abhishek Sharma had formed a strong opening pair, using a left-right combination and attacking from the very first ball.Gavaskar explained this by saying, ""And I think it's a course correction. In the sense that when Shubman came into the T20 squad, Sanju Samson went down the order. Sanju Samson and Abhishek Sharma had formed a very good opening pair - a left-hand, right-hand combination - looking to hit the first ball of the game for a six and getting India off to fabulous starts.""""I think that is something Ajit will definitely speak to Shubman about, assuring him that he's always going to be in the discussion. But for this particular tournament, considering the fact that he's had some injuries and hasn't been in the best of touch, they've left him out. That doesn't mean he won't be part of future teams,"" Gavaskar said.Shubman Gill has not been in great form in T20 cricket recently.Since returning to the T20I side during the Asia Cup 2025, he has played 15 matches but failed to score even one half-century.Injuries have also affected his rhythm and consistency. Because of these reasons, the selectors decided to drop him from the squad for the upcoming World Cup.","Shubman Gill was left out of India's T20 World Cup 2026 squad.

Pakistan beat India to clinch the U19 Asia Cup title in Dubai on Sunday. With Pakistan winning the trophy, the tournament managed to avoid what could've been a possible trophy-presentation controversy.The match was played at the ICC Academy Ground in Dubai, where Pakistan defeated India by a huge margin of 191 runs to lift the U19 Asia Cup for only the second time in their history.Asian Cricket Council (ACC) chairman Mohsin Naqvi was present at the stadium, which brought back memories of the drama that followed the senior Asia Cup final earlier this year.At that time, the Indian team had refused to accept the trophy from Naqvi, who is also a minister in the Pakistani government.Because of that incident, many wondered if a similar situation would arise again during the U19 final.India had come into the match as favourites.They had a strong history in the U19 Asia Cup and had already beaten Pakistan comfortably in the group stage.Naqvi’s presence in the stands added to the tension, especially since there was no handshake between players during both the group match and the final.However, this time there was no controversy.Pakistan completely outplayed India and left no room for confusion during the trophy ceremony.Pakistan’s batting was led by Sameer Minhas, who played a stunning knock of 172 runs from 113 balls. His innings helped Pakistan post a massive total of 347 for eight in their 50 overs.India’s chase never got going.Their batters struggled against Pakistan’s fast bowlers, who used pace and bounce effectively.Ali Raza picked up four wickets, while Mohammad Sayyam and Abdul Subhan chipped in with two each. India were bowled out for just 156 runs in 26.2 overs.After the match, Indian players chose not to go on stage where Naqvi was present.Instead, they collected their runners-up medals separately from another ACC official. Naqvi then presented the winners’ medals to the Pakistan U19 players and posed for photos with them.Later, Naqvi stepped into his role as Pakistan Cricket Board chairman and joined the team’s celebrations.

Everything is special about Vaibhav Suryavanshi: Vikram Rathour

NEW DELHI: It looked as if India did not come at all to the ground while chasing a mammoth target of 348 against Pakistan in the Under-19 Asia Cup final in Dubai on Sunday, as the Boys-in-Blue were dismissed for a mere 156 in just 26.2 overs to hand Pakistan a comfortable victory by 191 runs.With the thumping win, Pakistan have their first outright win in the Men's U-19 Asia Cup and first since being joint-winners with India in 2013.With a mountain of 348 runs to climb, India needed a strong start by the openers. India made a promising start, collecting 32 runs off the first two overs. But the innings unravelled quickly, as they were reduced to 49-3 in 4.1 overs with both openers Ayush Mhatre (2 off 7 balls), Vaibhav Sooryavanshi (26 off 10 balls), and number three Aaron George (16 off 9 balls), back in the hut cheaply.India needed a miracle from there, but today it wasn't meant to be, as wickets kept falling in regular intervals, and there was no partnership stitched. The highest partnership of the Indian innings came for the last wicket, 36 off 18 balls between Deepesh Devendran and Kishan Singh.Pakistan bowlers didn't give away easy runs and bowled tight lines from the beginning. Fast bowler Ali Raza took 4 wickets, including those of Ayush Mhatre, and Vaibhav Sooryavanshi.While Mohammad Sayyam, Abdul Subhan, Huzaifa Ahsan took 2 wickets each.Earlier, Pakistan opener Sameer Minhas once again gave a glimpse into his precocious talent, striking a brilliant century -- his second in the tournament -- as Pakistan made a steep 347 for 8 in an engrossing 50-over men's U19 Asia Cup final here on Sunday.Minhas, one of the standout performers for his side in the event, blazed to 172 off 113 deliveries as he carried the aspirations of his side, which lost the group match to the arch-foes by 90 runs at the same venue.Pakistan, coming into the final on the back of a clinical eight-wicket semifinal win against last edition champions Bangladesh, did not let India, who chose to bowl, settle down. Minhas, whose innings was studded with 17 boundaries and nine sixes, brought up his century off 71 balls with a four in the 29th over off Devendran. This was Minhas' second hundred in the competition having cracked an unbeaten 177 against Malaysia in the opening group match.Pakistan's Sameer Minhas won the Player-of-the-Match and also Player-of-the-Series award.","Pakistan beat India by 191 runs in the Under-19 Asia Cup final in Dubai.

Inside story of why Shubman Gill was DROPPED from India T20I World Cup squad

Former England cricketer Kevin Pietersen criticised the Ben Stokes-led team after their 82-run defeat in the third Test at the Adelaide Oval on Sunday, which helped Australia retain the Ashes with an unassailable 3-0 lead in the five-match series.Pietersen posted on X and said the loss was difficult to explain as Australia were without some key players. ""No Hazlewood, hardly any Cummins, Smith, Lyon, etc, makes this defeat tough to understand.""He also questioned the current approach of batters in the longer format. “Seen more dismissals this morning that tell me all I need to know about an earlier tweet I wrote, saying that batters are not tuned into Test Cricket anymore,” Pietersen wrote.In the match, Australia won the toss and chose to bat. England’s Jofra Archer and Brydon Carse reduced Australia to 94/4 in the first innings. Usman Khawaja steadied the innings with 82 off 126 balls, which included 10 fours. Alex Carey added runs at the other end.Carey scored his maiden Ashes century, making 106 off 143 balls with eight fours and a six. A partnership between Mitchell Starc (54 off 75 balls, eight fours) and Scott Boland (14 not out) pushed Australia’s total further.Australia were bowled out for 371 in 91.2 overs. Archer took five wickets for 53 runs, while Josh Tongue and Will Jacks took two wickets each.In reply, England were reduced to 168/8 as Nathan Lyon (2/70) and Pat Cummins (3/70) struck at regular intervals. Ben Stokes scored 83 off 198 balls, while Archer contributed 51 off 105 balls. Their partnership took England to 286, leaving them 85 runs behind. Boland then removed the tail with three wickets.In Australia’s second innings, England had some control with Australia at 149/4. Travis Head scored 170 off 219 balls, with 16 fours and two sixes, while Carey added 72 off 128 balls, hitting six fours. Australia were bowled out for 349, setting England a target of 435. Tongue took four wickets for 80 runs and Carse claimed three for 80.England lost Ben Duckett for 4 and Ollie Pope for 17 early in the chase to slip catches, slipping to 31/2. Joe Root scored 39 off 63 balls with five fours, adding 78 runs with Harry Brook. Root was dismissed by Cummins for the second time in the match and the 13th time in Tests.Zak Crawley and Brook took England forward until Brook was out attempting a reverse sweep after facing 56 balls. England then slipped from 177/3 to 194/6. Jamie Smith scored 60 off 83 balls with seven fours, sharing a 91-run stand with Will Jacks. Smith was dismissed off Mitchell Starc’s bowling.Jacks made 47 off 137 balls with three fours and added a half-century stand with Carse, who remained unbeaten on 39 off 64 balls. After Jacks was dismissed, England were bowled out for 352.Cummins took three wickets for 48 runs, Starc finished with three for 62, and Lyon took three for 77.

Fans throw objects, vandalise stadium after Messi leaves early | Hyderabad next

NEW DELHI: Former India football captain Bhaichung Bhutia has strongly criticised the chaos that took place during Lionel Messi ’s public event at the Salt Lake Stadium in Kolkata.Speaking on Sunday, Bhutia called the incident unfortunate and said sports events should always be treated with importance, without unnecessary delays caused by politics or formalities.He said fans come to stadiums to enjoy the sport and watch their favourite players, not to sit through long speeches or wait for VIPs to arrive.“I think when there is a sports event, sports should get priority,” he said.He also pointed out that this problem is seen often across India. According to Bhutia, many sporting events are delayed because organisers wait for politicians or chief guests. He said such practices only harm the experience for fans and players.“Many times across India, we see sporting events getting delayed because of political speeches, chief guest handshakes and all that. That is not necessary. Fans and players are coming to watch the sport, and the sport should begin rather than waiting for VIPs.”Talking about Lionel Messi’s recent G.O.A.T. Tour of India, Bhutia said the response from fans clearly showed what people really want. He said fans in Kolkata and other cities only wanted to see Messi and enjoy the sport, without any extra drama.“It was good to see not just in Kolkata, but across different cities, fans just wanted to see the sporting event, who just wanted to see Messi and nothing else.”Bhutia hopes that what happened in Kolkata will act as a wake-up call for organisers and authorities in the future.“I hope this is a lesson we will learn and that this trend will change,” he added.The promotional event featuring Lionel Messi turned chaotic due to poor planning and crowd control.Thousands of fans were disappointed as politicians, celebrities and officials surrounded Messi, limiting his interaction with the public.His time on the field was also cut short. Frustrated by the situation, some spectators created disturbances inside the stadium.","Bhaichung Bhutia has strongly criticised the chaos that took place during Lionel Messi’s public event at the Salt Lake Stadium in Kolkata. The former India football captain said sports events should always be treated with importance, without unnecessary delays.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126105598,imgsize-128288,width-400,resizemode-4/bhaichung-bhutia-in-kolkata.jpg"

Lionel Messi India tour: Inside story of what went wrong in Kolkata

NEW DELHI: Satadru Dutta, the main organiser of Lionel Messi’s event held on December 13 and now under arrest, has told investigators that the footballer was unhappy with physical contact during his appearance at the Salt Lake Stadium and left the venue before completing the scheduled programme, news agency PTI reported on Saturday, quoting a source in the Special Investigation Team (SIT).During questioning, Dutta told SIT officers that Messi ""did not like being touched on the back or being hugged"" and that this concern had been communicated in advance by foreign security officials assigned to protect the footballer, the source said.""Despite repeated public announcements to restrain the crowd, there was no impact. The manner in which Messi was surrounded and embraced was completely unacceptable to the World Cup-winning footballer,"" Dutta told investigators during his grilling on Friday, the source added, as cited by the PTI.West Bengal sports minister Aroop Biswas was seen close to Messi during the programme, with visuals showing him holding the footballer around the waist while posing for photographs. Biswas has been accused of using his influence to allow relatives and personal acquaintances access to Messi. Amid criticism, he resigned from his post as sports minister pending completion of the investigation.Investigators are examining how a large number of people were allowed to access the ground area.Dutta claimed that initially only 150 ground passes were issued, but the number was tripled after a ""very influential person"" arrived at the stadium and ""overpowered him"". Police are checking whether the increase in access led to the crowd control failure.""The arrested accused also claimed that once that particular influential person reached the stadium, all the flow-chart for the Messi programme got disturbed and he could not control it,"" the official told PTI.Dutta also shared financial details related to Messi’s India visit. ""Lionel Messi was paid Rs 89 crore for the tour, while Rs 11 crore was paid as tax to the Indian government,"" he told investigators, putting the total cost at Rs 100 crore. Sources said 30 per cent of the amount came from sponsors and another 30 per cent from ticket sales.SIT officers also found more than Rs 20 crore in Dutta’s frozen bank accounts. On Friday, they seized several documents during raids at his residence.""Dutta claimed that the amount in his bank account was the money which he got from selling the tickets for the Messi event in Kolkata and Hyderabad and also from the sponsors. We are verifying his claims,"" the officer said.What was supposed to be a marquee football spectacle turned into widespread violence and disorder at the stadium last week after Messi’s brief and tightly ring-fenced appearance, his first at the venue since 2011, left large sections of the crowd frustrated.They failed to catch a glimpse of their superstar despite having travelled from far and wide, paying hefty sums for tickets.The West Bengal government has formed an SIT comprising senior IPS officers Piyush Pandey, Javed Shamim, Supratim Sarkar and Muralidhar to investigate the vandalism, security lapses, access violations and the role of organisers and officials in the incident, the officer added.","Satadru Dutta, the main organiser of Lionel Messi’s event held on December 13 and now under arrest, has told investigators that the footballer was unhappy with physical contact.

A trophy with a meaning

The hollow in a million hearts

A new trophy, a new start

A forgotten memory

NEW DELHI: Looking back today, it feels almost unreal that the original FIFA World Cup trophy no longer exists.In an era where constant digital tracking and tight security were absent, football lost one of its most treasured symbols quietly and permanently. The Jules Rimet Trophy, which crowned the world champions of football for four decades, was stolen in 1983 and never recovered.The Jules Rimet Trophy was the first official World Cup prize. It was awarded to the winners of the FIFA World Cup from 1930 to 1970. Named after Jules Rimet, the former FIFA president who played a key role in starting the World Cup, the trophy carried enormous historical value.It was made of solid gold and featured a sculpted figure holding a cup, making it instantly recognisable to fans across the world.For Brazil, the trophy had special meaning.The country first won the World Cup in 1958 and defended the title in 1962. Brazil won the tournament in 1970 for the third time, completing a remarkable journey.At the time, it was under FIFA rules that any country that won the World Cup three times was allowed to keep the Jules Rimet Trophy permanently.Led by football legend Pelé, Brazil’s victory in 1970 gave the nation permanent ownership of the trophy.After the celebrations ended, the Jules Rimet Trophy was placed at the headquarters of the Brazilian Football Confederation in Rio de Janeiro.It was displayed in a glass case and treated as a symbol of Brazil’s football greatness. Security arrangements were modest, reflecting a time when the idea of stealing such an object seemed unlikely.That sense of safety did not last.In December 1983, the Jules Rimet Trophy was stolen. It all happened under the night skies when thieves broke into the CBF building. They damaged the display case and took the trophy.When officials arrived later, they found that the most famous prize in football history was gone.News of the theft reached the ears of the general public soon across Brazil and beyond. In a country where football makes people fanatics, the loss was deeply felt.The trophy was not only the representation of their success on the pitch, but it also stood for generations of players and moments that shaped the sport.Brazilian police launched an investigation immediately. Over time, several suspects were arrested, including a jeweller. Investigators worked to trace the trophy and understand the motive behind the theft. Their findings pointed to a simple but devastating conclusion. The Jules Rimet Trophy was made of solid gold, and gold could be melted.According to the investigation, the trophy was melted down and sold as gold. This conclusion was based on police evidence and statements from those involved.Once melted, the trophy lost its identity completely. No markings, shapes or features remained. Not a single piece of the original Jules Rimet Trophy has ever been recovered.This was not the first time the trophy had been stolen. In 1966, ahead of the World Cup in England, the Jules Rimet Trophy disappeared from an exhibition in London.In an interesting end to the saga, the trophy was found wrapped in newspaper under a hedge by a dog named Pickles.It was soon returned safely, and the incident became part of football folklore.The 1983 theft in Brazil had no such ending.With no hope of recovery, Brazil later commissioned a replica of the Jules Rimet Trophy. The replica was placed on display to preserve the memory of Brazil’s achievement.However, it could not replace the historical value of the original trophy that had been lifted by champions from 1930 onwards.The disappearance of the Jules Rimet Trophy also influenced how football treated its prizes.After Brazil’s third World Cup win, FIFA introduced a new trophy, first awarded in 1974. The current FIFA World Cup Trophy is not permanently awarded to any nation. Winners lift the original trophy during celebrations but are later given a replica to keep. The original remains under FIFA’s control.The loss of the Jules Rimet Trophy forced FIFA to look at this rule with a strict eye.For Brazil, the theft was especially painful.The 1970 team is widely considered one of the greatest sides in football history. Players like Pelé, Jairzinho, Rivelino and others created moments that will forever be in the memories of the fans.The trophy they earned through skill and success on the field was lost through negligence and crime.The story continues to be remembered even after decades.Authorities believe they know what happened to the trophy. Yet, the sense of loss remains because the outcome cannot be reversed.Football history was erased in physical form.Today, fans can only see photographs and replicas of the Jules Rimet Trophy. Museums display its likeness, and books recount its journey. But the original, which once travelled across continents and crowned the first world champions, no longer exists.The stolen World Cup trophy stands as a reminder of a different era. It shows how even the most valuable symbols can be lost if they are not protected. It also highlights how fragile history can be.Football has moved forward since then. New trophies have been lifted, new legends have emerged, and new memories have been created. Yet the story of the Jules Rimet Trophy remains one of the sport’s most sobering chapters.It is a throwback to a time when the World Cup could disappear. And never return.","The Jules Rimet Trophy was the first official World Cup prize. It was awarded to the winners of the FIFA World Cup from 1930 to 1970. For Brazil, the trophy had special meaning.

Engage with the Ministry as outlined above; and Constitute a joint working group comprising representatives of AIFF, Ministry and the Clubs to address legal, regulatory, and transitional matters, including timelines and approvals from AFC, FIFA, and the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India.""Representatives of all ISL clubs have been invited to attend the upcoming AIFF Annual General Meeting on Saturday, where the matter is expected to be discussed.","Indian Super League (ISL) clubs formally propose a fundamental restructuring of the country's top-tier professional football league.

At least 59 people, including seven police officers, were injured after violent clashes erupted between rival football supporters following Colombia’s Copa Colombia final in Medellin on Wednesday night, authorities said, in scenes that overshadowed Atletico Nacional’s title triumph.The unrest broke out moments after the final whistle at the Atanasio Girardot Stadium, where Atletico Nacional edged past city rivals Deportivo Independiente Medellin 1-0 to lift the trophy. What should have been a night of celebration quickly descended into chaos as fans from both sides stormed the pitch, hurled projectiles and clashed with security forces.Videos of the violence circulated widely on social media, showing dozens of supporters invading the field and confrontations breaking out in different sections of the stadium. Riot police were forced to intervene to restore order as the situation spiralled out of control in front of a crowd of around 43,000 spectators.Medellin’s security secretary Manuel Villa confirmed that 52 fans were treated for injuries sustained during the clashes, while police said seven officers were also hurt. No arrests were reported, but Villa said authorities were reviewing CCTV footage from inside and around the stadium to identify those responsible.The violence had immediate consequences for the event, with officials cancelling the post-match trophy presentation and medal ceremony for Atletico Nacional players due to safety concerns.In Colombia, visiting fans are typically barred from attending high-risk fixtures to prevent crowd trouble. However, Medellin city hall had allowed Atletico Nacional supporters — officially designated as the visiting side — to attend the final as part of an initiative to promote peaceful coexistence in football.Medellin mayor Federico Gutierrez strongly condemned the incidents, describing those involved as “criminals” and “misfits” who do not represent the sport.","At least 59 people, including seven police officers, were injured after violent clashes erupted following Colombia’s Copa Colombia final.

PARIS: Paris Saint-Germain goalkeeper Matvey Safonov has been left with a fractured hand following his penalty shootout heroics to win the Intercontinental Cup.Safonov made four straight penalty saves as PSG beat Brazil's Flamengo 2-1 in the shootout on Wednesday to secure the club's first global title. He was thrown in the air by his teammates during the celebrations.PSG said Friday that Safonov has a fracture in his left hand and that “his situation will be re-evaluated” after three or four weeks.“I can’t explain anything, it’s incredible. The player doesn’t know how it happened,” coach Luis Enrique said in translated comments Friday.He added that the most plausible explanation seemed to be that Safonov was hurt during the shootout and kept playing with the fracture.In a video posted on social media app Telegram, Safonov didn't address what happened directly, but said: “You know, no matter what happens, I can't be broken.”Safonov, PSG’s Russian backup goalkeeper, hadn’t played a single minute for the team until summer signing Lucas Chevalier sustained an ankle injury which has ruled him out since his last game Nov. 29.Chevalier was on the bench against Flamengo.

NEW DELHI: The Indian Super League (ISL) clubs were on Thursday asked to submit a proposal for forming a consortium to run the 2025-26 season of the league, which is yet to begin.Representatives of all ISL clubs were invited to attend the Annual General Meeting of the All India Football Federation on Saturday, on the sidelines of which the matter was discussed.“Regarding the consortium thing, the clubs have been told to submit to the ministry their proposal so that it can be discussed during the Dec 20 AGM. But there is no guarantee,” a club representative told news agency PTI.The request followed a virtual meeting on Thursday between AIFF officials, ISL club representatives and the sports ministry. The clubs were asked to submit their proposal by Friday evening.The AIFF also informed the clubs that, under its new constitution, any amendment to its provisions could be done only after the General Body of the national federation was formed according to the new constitution itself.“It could be hotchpotch also since the new National Sports Grievance Act is likely to be implemented shortly. So there can be changes under the Act also,” a source in the know of things said.Meanwhile, the Indian Women’s League, starting December 20, will be held without a sponsor after the AIFF and Capri Sports – the lone bidder in the national federation’s tender to monetise the commercial rights of the first and second divisions of the IWL for five years – could not reach an agreement.The clubs had earlier suggested forming a consortium to resolve the ongoing commercial impasse in Indian football.The AIFF said this would require deliberations and approval by its Executive Committee and the AGM.The Marketing Rights Agreement between the AIFF and Football Sports Development Limited, which organised the ISL for 12 seasons since its inception in 2014, ended on December 8, leaving the top-tier league without a commercial framework.","Indian Super League (ISL) clubs were on Thursday asked to submit a proposal for forming a consortium to run the 2025-26 season of the league, which is yet to begin.

NEW DELHI: Today is December 18. For some, it is just another day on the way to Christmas and the New Year. For football fans, however, it is a date that will forever live in the sport’s collective memory as the night Lionel Messi completed the game.Under the bright lights of Lusail Stadium in Qatar three years back, Argentina defeated France in a final that felt less like a match and more like destiny unfolding in real time.For Messi, it was not just a World Cup title; it was the closing chapter of a lifelong pursuit that had defined his career, his country, and an entire generation of football fans.For nearly two decades, Messi’s greatness had been measured against an absence.He had won everything at club level, from Champions League to multiple Ballon d’Ors, league titles and goal-scoring records that once seemed untouchable.And yet, the World Cup remained the one prize that eluded him, the yardstick by which football immortality is often judged.In Argentina, where Diego Maradona ’s shadow still loomed large, that absence was felt more sharply than anywhere else.Qatar 2022 began with doubt rather than certainty. Argentina’s shocking opening defeat to Saudi Arabia threatened to derail the campaign before it truly began.For a brief moment, old fears resurfaced: was this another World Cup destined to end in heartbreak for Messi?But what followed was a team and a captain refusing to surrender to narrative or pressure.Messi led with calm authority. He scored, he created, he inspired, and, perhaps most importantly, he believed.From the group stages to the knockout rounds, Argentina grew stronger with each game, feeding off Messi’s composure and clarity. Against Australia, the Netherlands, and Croatia, he was not just a playmaker but the emotional compass of the side, guiding younger teammates through moments of chaos and tension.Then came the final: Argentina versus France, Messi versus Kylian Mbappé, experience versus explosive youth. It was billed as a passing-of-the-torch moment, but Messi was not ready to hand anything over.He scored from the penalty spot to give Argentina the lead and later added a second, arriving in the box with perfect timing to finish off a flowing move. At 2–0, it seemed as though the dream was finally within reach.Football, however, rarely allows fairy tales to unfold without resistance. In a breathtaking twist, Mbappé struck twice in the space of minutes to drag France back into the contest.Extra time followed, and Messi once again stepped up, poking the ball home to make it 3–2. Still, France refused to yield. Mbappé completed his hat-trick from the penalty spot, forcing a shootout that felt almost unbearable in its tension.As penalties loomed, the weight of history hung heavy. Argentina had been here before. It was close, but not close enough. This time, though, the script was different.Emiliano Martínez produced heroics in goal, Argentine penalties were struck with conviction, and when Gonzalo Montiel converted the decisive kick, Messi dropped to his knees, overcome with emotion.Tears flowed freely.Teammates swarmed him. In that moment, the burden he had carried for so long seemed to lift. The image of Messi, draped in the black bisht as he raised the World Cup trophy, became instantly iconic.For Argentina, the victory healed old wounds. It united generations that had debated Messi’s place in the pantheon and finally allowed him to be celebrated without caveats.For Messi himself, it was redemption, validation, and closure all at once.He had not just won a World Cup; he had done so as the undisputed leader of the team, delivering when it mattered most.Two years on, the significance of that night has only grown.December 18 is no longer just a date on the football calendar. It is the day Lionel Messi stepped beyond comparison, beyond debate, and into footballing eternity; World Cup in hand, legacy complete.","Lionel Messi won the FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022 trophy on December 18, 2013.

Drake Maye walks into Sunday Night Football carrying more than momentum. He brings calm, confidence, and a season that has reshaped how New England views its future. As the Patriots prepare for a high-stakes road test against the Baltimore Ravens, the spotlight stretches beyond the field. It now reaches into kitchens, phones, and social feeds where a different kind of buzz has been building around Foxborough.Winning changes everything. At 11-3, the Patriots are no longer chasing respect. They are defending it. Maye’s command has steadied a young roster, even as the AFC East race tightens with Buffalo lurking. Yet amid the pressure of prime time football, something lighter has captured fans’ attention. It comes with flour, frosting, and a warm presence that feels rare in a league driven by noise.Maye’s numbers tell part of the story. He has thrown for 3,567 yards with 23 touchdowns and just seven interceptions, production that reflects poise rather than flash. Still, the week leading into Baltimore had another storyline. Ann Michael Maye stepped out before the game in a sharp dress paired with black knee-high boots, turning heads without trying to.It matched the effortless appeal she has shown all month online.Her daily TikTok baking series, known as Bakemas, has taken off during December. Patriots fans flooded the comments, sharing recipes, encouragement, and holiday cheer. Ann Michael even baked Patriots-themed cookies ahead of a big game, blending fandom with warmth in a way that felt genuine. That authenticity is what Maye believes sparked the surge.“I think it happened fast,” Maye said to Sunday Night Football on Fox. “During the Holiday season in the last couple of weeks, it’s taken off. But I think it’s just her being herself. She’s been awesome. She’s been a great addition up here for me. Getting married in the offseason, her coming up here to live in Boston. She’s from the South, (has) southern charm.“She’s just being herself on social media. (She’s) baking for me, and I’m trying to bring some extra baked goods in here, give some to the offensive line or something. But, she’s just being herself, and I love her for it. I tell her that all the time, ‘Don’t change for anything.’ I think she deserves all the support.”The couple married on June 22, 2025, after a relationship that began a decade earlier. With success comes visibility, and Maye welcomes it. He echoed the same pride when speaking with Devin McCourty.“She’s been awesome,” Maye told former Patriots player and current NBC analyst Devin McCourty before the clash with the Ravens. “She’s been a great addition up here for me. Getting married in the offseason, her coming up here to live in Boston. She’s from the South, [has] Southern charm.”As New England pushes toward January, Maye looks steady under the lights. Off the field, Ann Michael’s rise feels just as organic. In a season defined by belief, both have found their rhythm, and fans are enjoying every part of it.Also Read: Detroit Lions QB Jared Goff’s wife Christen reveals how motherhood inspired a complete makeover of both family homes","Drake Maye and Ann Michael Hudson are the New England Patriots quarterback and his wife, respectively.

Jared Goff ’s wife, Christen, creates two homes with one heart



Jared Goff’s wife, Christen, stepped into motherhood with the same intention she brings to every part of her life. Since welcoming daughter Romy, her days have been shaped by movement between two cities, two homes, and one new priority. While her husband leads the Detroit Lions on the field, Christen has been quietly redefining what home means during one of the biggest transitions of her life.Life now unfolds between Los Angeles and Michigan, places tied deeply to the couple’s journey. One carries the rhythm of the ocean, the other the warmth of Midwest winters. With a newborn in tow, those spaces needed to feel safe, calm, and deeply personal. Christen approached that challenge not as a checklist, but as an emotional reset that reflects who they are becoming as a family.For Christen, adapting both houses meant honoring their personalities while making room for Romy. She openly admits she is learning as she goes, sharing, “We’re so lucky to be able to live in two different places.” In California, where she grew up, the home leans into light and air. “I grew up in California, and there, we live by the beach, so our house kind of reflects that,” she says. “We live steps away from the ocean so our house definitely has more of a coastal feel, very indoor-outdoor, which we love.Michigan tells a different story. “And then here in Michigan, our house is a little bit more cozy, kind of farmhouse country. We always have the fireplace going, even in the summer, which is kind of insane, but I would say that this house is so cozy and it just makes me want to cuddle up on the couch and watch a movie.” Each space now includes a nursery that mirrors its surroundings. “In L.A., it’s, like, boho, Bohemian,” she explains. “We have some fun antiques in there.” Michigan’s nursery leans softer. “And then this one is a little more classy,” she says. “Her nursery is so sweet here. It's very, like, muted pink tones. I went full into the girly pink.”As the holidays approach, Michigan will host Romy’s first Christmas. “We are here in Michigan through this season, so we're here, we'll be celebrating here, which is great,” Christen says, adding, “I love a California Christmas by the beach, but nothing beats a fireplace rolling with snow outside and your Christmas tree lit.”Behind the scenes, motherhood has brought exhaustion and joy in equal measure. “I feel like it's a roller coaster a bit,” she admits. Laundry piles up, routines shift, and patience gets tested. Still, perspective grounds her. “My key is chipping away day by day at everything,” she explains. “Just doing what you can and giving yourself grace.”In this season, Christen has found belonging in a new circle. “I feel like I'm part of this new club of women and we all have something in common,” she says. “Moms are superheroes.”Also Read: Travis Hunter’s wife Leanna turns heads in chic white bikini selfie during family birthday celebration","Jared Goff’s wife, Christen, stepped into motherhood with the same intention she brings to every part of her life.

Travis Hunter finds balance as football pauses and family takes center stage



Travis Hunter has spent the past year learning how quickly life can change, both on and off the field. While the Jacksonville Jaguars rookie works through a challenging recovery, moments of calm and celebration have emerged around him, led quietly by his wife, Leanna. Her recent Instagram post offered a glimpse into that steadier side of their lives, one defined less by headlines and more by family ties.The image was simple but striking. Leanna stood beside her cousin against a brick wall, dressed in a white bikini top, sunglasses in place, confidence unforced. It was not a publicity play or a statement piece. It was personal. The caption read, “Happy birthday to my fav cousin.” In a season shaped by injury and interruption, the post landed as a reminder that life continues beyond football schedules and rehab timelines.Leanna’s story has always been one of quiet determination. Born in England in November 2001, she moved to the United States at age 10 and adapted quickly after her parents divorced. She later graduated from Kennesaw State University in just two years, earning her bachelor’s degree well before many of her peers. Her path crossed with Hunter’s in 2022, long before draft night lights. Their relationship grew alongside his rise, culminating in a wedding on May 24, 2025, just weeks after he was selected second overall by Jacksonville.Three months later, they welcomed a baby boy, adding a new rhythm to their lives.That rhythm became even more important when Hunter’s rookie season ended abruptly. After Jacksonville leaned heavily on him in Week 7, where he posted eight catches for 101 yards and his first NFL touchdown, plans were in motion to expand his role. Those plans stopped when he suffered a noncontact lateral collateral ligament injury during practice on Oct. 30. Surgery followed, and so did a shift in focus.Recovery gave Hunter time to look inward and outward at once. He surprised his father by arranging a move into a new home, offering stability during a complicated chapter. Hunter Sr., now back on probation after a brief July detention that was ultimately withdrawn, has been spending time with his son as the younger Hunter rehabs. Football will return when the knee allows it. For now, the moments that matter most are the quiet ones, framed by family, resilience, and a future still very much in motion.Also Read: Who is Aaron Rodgers’ wife Brittani: Everything you need to know as Steelers QB's marriage mystery deepens","Jacksonville Jaguars rookie Travis Hunter has spent the past year recovering from a knee injury.

Will DK Metcalf face NFL punishment after viral video shows Steelers star punching Lions fan?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/will-dk-metcalf-face-nfl-punishment-after-viral-video-shows-steelers-star-punching-lions-fan/articleshow/126112034.cms,"Pittsburgh Steelers wide receiver DK Metcalf (Via CBS)

DK Metcalf incident raises discipline concerns before Browns clash



D.K. Metcalf never blends into the background, and once again, his intensity has placed him at the center of an uncomfortable spotlight. The Pittsburgh Steelers’ wide receiver is now facing league scrutiny after a heated moment on the road that could ripple into a crucial divisional matchup. With playoff stakes rising and tempers already flaring late in the season, the timing could not be worse for Pittsburgh or its passing game.Late in the first half at Ford Field, emotions spilled beyond the sidelines. As the Steelers battled the Lions, Metcalf appeared to exchange words with a fan seated in the front row of the end zone. Moments later, cameras caught the receiver taking a swipe toward the fan’s head. Officials did not notice the incident, allowing Metcalf to remain in the game, but the footage quickly spread, putting his availability for the Browns game in question and inviting potential discipline from the league.DK Metcalf’s confrontation was sparked when a fan reportedly held up a Pittsburgh No. 4 jersey and said something that drew his attention. Whatever the words were, Metcalf reacted instantly. While the swing did not land, the act itself crosses a clear boundary in the NFL’s eyes. Players are expected to absorb verbal abuse without retaliation, especially when no physical contact occurs from the stands.This situation is likely to be reviewed closely by NFL executives, particularly given Metcalf’s recent history.Earlier this season, he was fined $12,172 for unnecessary roughness against Green Bay and $14,491 for an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty against Buffalo. A third fine would reinforce a pattern, even if it stops short of a suspension.Still, reducing Metcalf to a problem player misses the bigger picture. He plays with force, confidence, and urgency, traits that have fueled his production throughout his career. In his first season with Pittsburgh, he has already posted 55 receptions for 808 yards and six touchdowns heading into Week 16. That edge has also helped him build quick chemistry with Aaron Rodgers, who leans on Metcalf in high-pressure moments.The Steelers are staring at two defining divisional games against the Browns and Ravens. With playoff scenarios tightening, losing Metcalf, even for one week, would sting. Pittsburgh can still control its fate, but discipline off the field now threatens to complicate everything on it.Also Read: Saquon Barkley’s kids: Meet daughter Jada and son Saquon Jr., the young stars behind the NFL icon","Pittsburgh Steelers wide receiver DK Metcalf is facing league scrutiny after a heated moment on the road.

Gracie Hunt attends AmericaFest in support of Erika Kirk

The most recent public appearance by Gracie Hunt has been a combination of politics, pop culture, and pro sports that immediately made headlines online. At Turning Point USA, the Kansas City Chiefs heiress was in the limelight in their AmericaFest 2025 event, where she had more than just a fashion scene or a photo op moment.Her appearance was an indicator of individual belief, collective identification, and an expanding power that goes way beyond the NFL universe. The only thing that increased the popularity of the moment was the unplanned encounter with WNBA star Sophie Cunningham, making an ordinary Instagram interaction a trending cross over event.Hunt attended the multi-day conservative youth conference in Phoenix, posting photos in a neutral-toned outfit while reflecting on the experience. In her caption, she wrote, “Grateful for a powerful few days celebrating faith, freedom, and this incredible country we call home. 🇺🇸🤍 ‘Blessed is the nation whose God is the Lord.’ — Psalm 33:12.”Among the many reactions, Indiana Fever guard Sophie Cunningham dropped two fire emojis, prompting Hunt’s warm reply: “Right back at you Beautiful!” The brief exchange resonated because it linked two women from very different sports worlds, reinforcing how shared values often create unexpected connections.Hunt’s recent remarks that she is in favor of a more family-friendly approach to the halftime of the Super Bowl also drew a lot of attention. “I really respect Erika for all that she’s done, especially with creating a halftime show for America,” Kirk said on Nov. 19, via “The Will Cain Show,” she said.Hunt also shared her thoughts that future halftime performers should reflect the NFL’s values. “That football is the attraction and that it didn’t need to compromise its character or rely on cheap appeal to draw an audience, especially when that approach can alienate so much of the fan base,” Hunt said.Also Read: Erika Kirk pulls Taylor Swift into a fresh controversy after viral funeral comments spark backlash while Travis Kelce ignores the drama","Kansas City Chiefs heiress Gracie Hunt made her most recent appearance a mix of politics, pop culture, and pro sports.

How Taylor Swift pushed through injury and chaos without missing a beat

Taylor Swift has constructed her Eras Tour as one of accuracy, endurance, and emotional attachment but beyond the perfect shows was a dose of physical roughness that fans hardly noticed. During her The End of an Era docuseries, Swift at last discusses a backstage accident that caused her to bleed and limp only moments before her next appearance onstage.Still, Swift didn't let the painful mishap prevent her from heading back to the stage just in time for the next song to begin. Although the moment went unnoticed on stage, Swifties did notice it a few days later.In Episode 3 of The End of an Era docuseries, Swift recalls tripping while racing backstage between eras. “I remember one time I was running from the ‘Evermore’ era. I trip over the hem of my dress, bust my knee, I skid the palm of my hand off, hobble into the quick change room.”She continued, “Blood’s coming down my hand, I’m changing into the ‘Reputation’ bodysuit, the skin that’s flapping off I just pull it off, more blood. They don’t have a Band-Aid back there. (I) wasn't late for the intro of that song.”She further added that although fans didn't notice her bruise on stage, they later found out a few days later.""They're like, 'Oh, her palm's gone.' I was like, 'I'm not acknowledging this. What? Nothing's wrong. It's always been like that.’”Swift acknowledged the injury in a 2023 Instagram post. She wrote,“PS for those asking how I cut my hand, I’m totally fine and it was my fault completely tripped on my dress hem and fell in the dark backstage while running to a quick change braced my fall with my palm.

“We just wanted different things”: Gisele Bündchen says her divorce from Tom Brady was about far more than his NFL return,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/we-just-wanted-different-things-gisele-bndchen-says-her-divorce-from-tom-brady-was-about-far-more-than-his-nfl-return/articleshow/126104796.cms,"Gisele Bündchen clarified that Tom Brady's return to the NFL was not the sole reason for their divorce, stating it was a complex issue of growing apart. She emphasized that personal growth and differing life desires led to their split after 16 years together. Bündchen has since moved on and remarried, while Brady remains focused on his children.

Gisele Bündchen says her split with Tom Brady was about growth and not football

In October 2022, at the time when Tom Brady and Gisele Bundchen finalized their divorce, the media began to focus the discourse on a single explanation that was headline friendly, that is football. The evaluation of Brady rejoining the NFL and ending his retirement was thought to be the tipping point. But, Bündchen herself pushed back the theory in a candid interview with Vanity Fair.At present, Bündchen has completely moved on from Brady and has also recently tied the knot to her Joaquim Valante. However, on the other hand, Brady appears to be still enjoying his single life and being a dad to his children.In a 2023 interview with Vanity Fair, Bündchen was clear that Brady’s return to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers was not the real reason behind their split. She noted that the reasons for the divorce were far more complex.Bündchen said, ""Wow, people really made it about that. What's been said is one piece of a much bigger puzzle. It's not so black and white... Sometimes you grow together; sometimes you grow apart. When I was 26 years old and he was 29 years old, we met, we wanted a family, we wanted things together. As time goes by, we realize that we just wanted different things, and now we have a choice to make.”She further added, ""That doesn't mean you don't love the person. It just means that in order for you to be authentic and truly live the life that you want to live, you have to have somebody who can meet you in the middle, right? It's a dance. It's a balance.”Brady and Bündchen got married in 2009 and spent a total of 16 years together before getting divorced. Together, they are parents to son Benjamin Rein, 16, and daughter Vivian Lake, 13, and Brady is also a dad to son John ""Jack"" Edward Thomas with his ex-girlfriend, Bridget Moynahan.Bündchen and Valente, who began dating in June 2023, welcomed a baby boy together earlier this year.

Andrea Swift gushes over Travis Kelce in new documentary

The new Eras Tour documentary by Taylor Swift is causing a new wave of debate online, and this time around, the focus is not on Taylor and her love life, but her mom. When Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour - The End of an Era unleashed new episodes, fans became fascinated by the open-minded commentary of Andrea Swift, especially her gushing about Travis Kelce To Swifties, the comparison was dramatic. The tender, even protective way Andrea speaks of Kelce and her advice to Taylor to do something different has been construed as the unofficial sentence against her previous relationships.In the documentary, Andrea recounts how headlines about Travis Kelce attending Taylor’s show caught her attention, leading her to quietly vet him through family.Andrea said, “I’m looking at the headlines … and I see that this guy came to your show, and he brought a friendship bracelet and wants to meet you,” and after calling her cousin Robin to vet him, she was told, “Oh my God, he is the nicest guy! And you know what? He really loves his mom.”Andrea later advised Swift “ to start doing something different” and described Kelce's gestures as “so earnest” and “the sweetest thing in the world.” Before Swift's romance with Kelce, she had a short fling with Matty Healy. And prior to that, she was in a long-time relationship with Joe Alwyn.In the Eras Tour documentary, Andrea insists Swift, ""You gotta do something different,"" which fans have interpreted as her subtle disapproval of Alwyn.While she sounded not so pleased with Swift's past partners, she was seen gushing about Kelce.“He really is one of the happiest people I think I’ve ever met, which I adore. He just brought a lot of happiness, which is, I think, what he does in a lot of his circles; he brings a lot of happiness to the room,” Andrea said about the Chiefs' TE.Swift also openly discussed the challenges she faced with her past relationships. “Relationships on tour has always been something I’ve really struggled with because it’s always felt like the tour was taking away from the relationship,” she said. “Somehow, I was not able to do both and feel like I was nurturing both at the same time, even though I would try and try and try and try.”The pair is planning to tie the knot on June 13, 2026, according to Page Six.

Will Patrick Mahomes play against Tennessee Titans today?



Already eliminated from the playoff race, Kansas City Chiefs will face Tennessee Titans on Sunday. Arrowhead silence is rare in December, but this season has forced Kansas City into unfamiliar territory. What was expected to be another late-year surge instead unraveled with startling speed. Injuries piled up, early warning signs became permanent cracks, and the league’s most reliable problem-solving machine finally stalled. Now, as the Chiefs head to Nashville, the focus has shifted from postseason positioning to pride, evaluation, and survival.Sunday’s game at Nissan Stadium was once framed as a marquee clash, a glimpse into the NFL’s present and future. Fans expected to watch Patrick Mahomes test himself against Tennessee’s top pick Cam Ward. Instead, the matchup arrives stripped of its star power, reshaped by injury and disappointment, and heavy with the weight of what might have been.No, Patrick Mahomes will not suit up against the Titans. His season ended abruptly last week when he suffered a torn ACL and LCL in his left knee, an injury that slammed the door on Kansas City’s playoff hopes and altered the franchise’s immediate future. Surgery followed quickly, performed Monday in Dallas by Dr. Dan Cooper of the Carrell Clinic. Team officials confirmed Mahomes will begin rehabilitation right away.The timeline ahead carries both caution and optimism. If recovery progresses smoothly, Mahomes could be back early in the 2026 regular season. A slower path may push his return closer to November, but the Chiefs remain confident in his long-term outlook. For now, Gardner Minshew is expected to start under center, beginning with the Week 16 road trip to Tennessee.This absence marks a sharp break from routine. For the first time since 2014, Kansas City will watch the NFL playoffs from home. A decade of dominance ended not with a dramatic collapse, but with a quiet realization that answers were running out. Defensive issues lingered from the opener. A loss in Jacksonville hinted at trouble. Then injuries turned strain into surrender.Still, the Chiefs are not approaching Sunday as a formality. Andy Reid made that clear while addressing Tennessee’s resilience and physicality.“They’re playing good football,” said Reid, “particularly on the defensive side with that defensive front. They’ve got a heck of a defensive front. Mike’s done a nice job of taking over as the interim. He’s had a lot of experience as a head coach, so he knows how to handle a role like that. He’s done a nice job of keeping the guys going and playing hard.”With three games left, Kansas City’s goal is simple. Finish with purpose. Evaluate honestly. And wait for the return of the quarterback who defines the franchise.Also Read: Patrick Mahomes surprises Chiefs teammates with early Christmas gifts despite his own injury struggles","Patrick Mahomes will not play against Tennessee Titans on Sunday.

NBA injury update: Ivica Zubac timeline and details



Clippers must adjust without Ivica Zubac



The Los Angeles Clippers finally had a reason to smile after a rare home win, but the relief did not last long. Late in the first quarter against the Lakers, Ivica Zubac went down hard, clutching his left ankle as the arena fell quiet. He tried to gather himself, but the limp toward the locker room told the story before any report arrived.By Sunday, the NBA injury update delivered clarity and concern. Zubac will miss several weeks after being diagnosed with a Grade 2 left ankle sprain. As the Clippers are already searching for stability, losing their most reliable interior presence will have a major impact in the weeks ahead.The injury occurred during Saturday’s 103-88 win when Ivica Zubac landed on LeBron James’ foot while attempting a shot near the elbow. He stayed on the floor as play continued, then exited for evaluation and never returned. At the time, Zubac had five points and two rebounds in 11 minutes.ESPN’s Shams Charania reported the diagnosis on Sunday. He shared that the absence will stretch multiple weeks. The Clippers later confirmed Zubac will be reevaluated in three weeks, leaving no firm return date. The setback interrupts one of the strongest stretches of Zubac’s career.The 28-year-old is averaging 15.6 points, 11.1 rebounds, and 2.5 assists while shooting 60.9 percent from the field.Lakers center Jaxson Hayes showered praise for the Clippers center. “Zu is a dog, man,” Hayes said. “He's, honestly, I feel like one of the most slept-on bigs in the league, man. If you play him, you know he's like that. Zu has been like that for years.”Zubac’s absence lands at a difficult point in the schedule. The Clippers sit near the bottom of the Western Conference after a long stretch of losses, even with Saturday’s win snapping a home drought that dated back to October.Kawhi Leonard’s season-high 32 points lifted the team against the Lakers, but the challenge now shifts to sustaining progress without their defensive anchor.Brook Lopez is expected to slide into the starting lineup while Tyronn Lue experiments with rotations behind him. Zubac leads the team in rebounds and blocks, ranks among the top scorers, and provides structure on both ends of the floor. His durability had been a constant until now, with six straight seasons of heavy availability entering this year.As the Clippers prepare for upcoming matchups, including a meeting with the Houston Rockets, the focus turns to survival and adaptability. The hope inside the organization is that rest and time will bring Zubac back before the season slips further.Also Read: Why NBA punish David Adelman?

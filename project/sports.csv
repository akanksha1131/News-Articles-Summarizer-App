NEW DELHI: The Australian media has been heavily promoting the Border-Gavaskar Trophy series, with a particular focus on Virat Kohli , given his immense popularity and fan following in the country.India are scheduled to face Australia in a Pink Ball Test in Adelaide on December 6, following a two-day warm-up match in Canberra against the Prime Minister's XI.During an interview with ABC Sports, several Australian players were asked which Indian player they would like to have in their Test team.While there was no one advocating for Team India skipper Rohit Sharma , Nathan Lyon, Mitchell Marsh , and Alex Carey unanimously expressed their desire to have Virat Kohli in their batting lineup, acknowledging his exceptional batting acumen and the added strength he would bring to their team.Glenn Maxwell, who has played alongside Kohli in the Indian Premier League (IPL) for Royal Challengers Bengaluru, highlighted Kohli's consistent and outstanding performances against Australia across formats.""Well, it's probably hard to get past my RCB teammate. Virat. That's gonna be a popular answer. I don't really care what he does against other nations. But it seems like every time against Australia, he grows a couple of inches and just brings his best performances. He'll be hard work this summer,"" said Maxwell.While Kohli was the popular choice among most Australian players, Steve Smith and Travis Head opted for Jasprit Bumrah , the Indian pace spearhead.Head's reasoning was straightforward – he would prefer not to face Bumrah's formidable bowling skills. ""Bumrah. Don't have to face him,"" added the destructive Australian opener.However, Australian captain Pat Cummins provided a lighthearted and cheeky response, choosing neither Kohli nor Bumrah, much to the amusement of the interviewer.",Several Australian players were asked which Indian player they would like to have in their Test team.

NEW DELHI: Arguably the greatest fast bowler in the history of cricket, Wasim Akram 's influence extends beyond his records.The former Pakistani cricketer and captain has inspired generations of fast bowlers globally, especially in Pakistan, where his reverse swing mastery set a template for many bowlers.After retiring as one of the greats of the game, Akram is working as a commentator, cricket analyst, and nowadays is commentating on the Border-Gavaskar Trophy for the Test series between India and Australia.Star Sports, the official broadcaster of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy series in India, shared a video of Akram decoding the bowling of Jasprit Bumrah , who led India to an emphatic victory in the first Test in Perth.Explaining his wrist action and skidding of the ball, Akram says, ""Bumrah's bowling arm comes from behind (the shoulder) the hyper-extension and in the end as we say in Punjabi ""tunka"" flick of the wrist that makes the ball skid which as a batsman you don't expect specially on the wickets where the ball is keeping low, he has troubled the batsmen of that action which is natural and it is very tough to flick the wrist in the end.""India defeated Australia by 295 runs to take a 1-0 lead in the five-match Border-Gavaskar Trophy as stand-in captain Bumrah returned with outstanding match spell of 8/72.Bumrah almost defies the laws of physics with his ability to release the ball about 34 cms ahead of the popping crease, when most bowlers release it within 10 cms ahead of the line. These extra 24 cms that Bumrah gets from his release point makes him a terror as he gets the ball to hurry on to the batter like nobody else.Akram adds, ""The release point of Bumrah's delivery also differs by almost 40 cms and that makes a quite a big difference at this pace and that's why his deliveries skid after pitching.""Bumrah is not a natural athlete, but it is his ability to surpass the obstacles that has made him the match-winner that he is.",Wasim Akram is commentating on the Border-Gavaskar Trophy between India and Australia.

Prithvi Shaw, base price Rs 75 lakh, failed to attract a bid at IPL 2025 mega auction

NEW DELHI: Prithvi Shaw faced a major setback at the IPL 2025 mega auction as the opening batter went unsold, with no franchises showing interest in acquiring him.Shaw's struggles with form and fitness have significantly impacted his value, leading to his exclusion from the bidding process.This development marks a significant blow to Shaw's efforts to reignite his career, especially after being released by Delhi Capitals ahead of the auction. With this disappointment, questions loom over Shaw's future in both the IPL and international cricket.In a podcast, Shaw's former coach Jwala Singh explained the reason for the batter's downfall and why he remained unsold at the IPL auction in Jeddah.On being asked by the host that why Shaw disappeared from the scene even though he was extremely talented, Jwala Singh said, ""Prithvi came to me in 2015 and was with me for three years. And when he came he had not played Mumbai Under-16 matches and his father asked me to guide him. Then in next year, he played the Under-19 Cooch Behar Trophy and scored big in selection matches. And I worked very hard on him. Basically he was talented from the beginning, I will not take full credit because many coaches have worked for him, but at that time it was only me. I was excited when he played the Under-19 World Cup because he was my first student to do so. Before leaving for the Under-19 World Cup, he had celebrated his birthday with me. But after that I have not seen him, that was 2017, we are in 2024, I have not seen him, he has not come to me.""On being again asked by the host that when Shaw was emerging on the scene he was compared to legends like Brian Lara Sachin Tendulkar , he made a hundred on Test and then started his problems with the incoming delivery and that grew so much that there are questions raised about his weight, confidence, attitude, so what has Yashasvi Jaiswal done that Shaw couldn't do because both were equally talented?Jwala Singh, who was also the coach of Yashasvi Jaiswal, replies, ""I think the process, which we call work ethic, so I feel if you are talented, talent is just a seed, to make it a tree, consistency is very important in that journey and that consistency comes from your lifestyle, your work ethic and discipline, so what I feel is that consistency is not with him. One can make great start which he did but to stay at the top in international cricket, one has to improve his game all the time. Even Sachin Tendulkar refined his game consistently, fine-tuned his game, worked on his fitness and mental toughness. So I feel a player goes off track only if he gets away from the process. You will not fall back if your process and work ethic is fine, so I feel players fail because of that. As far as Yashasvi is concerned, is work ethic is superb, he really works hard and he knows what to do. That is the main difference.""Following disappointing performances in the first two rounds of the 2024 Ranji Trophy, Shaw was dropped from Mumbai's squad for the third round.Reports indicate that the decision was influenced not just by his poor form but also by disciplinary concerns, including missed training sessions, adding to his struggles.Shaw's journey has been a rollercoaster of highs and lows. In 2018, he was named by the ICC as one of the top five breakout stars in men's cricket, showcasing immense potential.However, his career hit a stumbling block in 2019 when he received a doping ban from the BCCI, ruling him out of action until November that year.","Prithvi Shaw, base price Rs 75 lakh, failed to attract a bid at IPL 2025 mega auction.

CHENNAI: With nerves running high, Vijay Shankar couldn't bring himself to watch the IPL mega auction. It wasn't until a call from his wife that he found out he was returning to Chennai Super Kings . Having spent two formative years with the franchise, an evolved Vijay Shankar is back where it all began for him, after a decade.In an interview with TOI, Vijay Shankar, who was purchased for 1.20 crore, said he was glad to find out that his former team, Gujarat Titans , and CSK were battling for him.""To be very honest, I didn't watch the auction at all, especially when my name popped up. I didn't see it because, as players, it's very difficult to just sit and watch what's happening there. My wife called me and congratulated me that I got picked by CSK-that's when I knew,"" he said.""I made my IPL debut with CSK 10 years ago. I might have played just one game, but the two years that I was part of that franchise were filled with a lot of learnings. I felt happy being part of CSK, and then to get back after 10 years, it's great.""For someone who has played cricket in Tamil Nadu for so many years and has been a consistent performer across all formats, he said the homecoming is very special and he is eager to step onto the MA Chidambaram stadium, where he still ""gets butterflies in the stomach"".""For every TN cricketer, I'm sure their first dream would have been to enter Chepauk and play a match there. During my under-14 tournaments, we used to go practise at the Chepauk 'B' ground, and after that, we would just go and have a look at the stadium. The aura it has is something unbelievable. So from that to playing for CSK or against CSK in the last few years, it was very special. It's very hard to explain that feeling.""The 33-year-old all-rounder, who also bowls medium pace, said he is flexible to bat at any position and bowl whenever the team needs him. ""I always see myself and my role as someone who goes in and does what the team needs in that situation because I always feel like I can adapt to it quickly. It's both my strength and weakness - to be able to adapt to different situations or conditions. If you see in all the IPL matches that I've played, I have batted in almost every position, from three to eight. I also feel that, in cricket right now, if you're not a top-three batter, then you should be really versatile.""And even in terms of my bowling, I'll always keep bowling, whether they give me the ball or not. If you see my bowling, I haven't bowled regularly even for TN, but whenever the team needs me to bowl, I'll always be there. It has always been like that. So again, it's a very difficult space to be in because you don't know whether you're going to bowl or what's going to happen, but you have to keep preparing for that. In the last two years, there wouldn't have been a single practice session where I didn't bowl in the nets,"" Vijay Shankar said.Speaking about MS Dhoni , Vijay Shankar, who has shared the dressing room with the legendary wicketkeeper-batter quite a few times, said: ""Ever since I started playing, Mahi bhai has been a great example - the way a leader should be, how one should carry himself on the field...We've all looked up to him.""Vijay Shankar said the past three seasons with Gujarat Titans was a big learning curve for him. ""I feel GT is one of the very special teams because of the way they handled every individual. It was very good. The way (coach) Ashish Nehra and the support staff managed everyone was incredible. I think they were able to take care of every player, and even net bowlers were treated equally in the team. The amount of time that we get to practise there was huge, and as players, when you train that much, you're always ready to go in and do whatever the team needs.""",Vijay Shankar was bought by Chennai Super Kings for 1.20 crore.

He is always hungry for runs and it makes him different from the others. I think he is an all-format player. He can play equally well in Tests as well as in the limited-over versions,"" said Chopra during an event on Thursday.Jaiswal lit up Perth in his maiden Test on Australian soil, hammering a glorious 161 in the second innings. The dashing opener's heroics were pivotal in securing a 1-0 lead for India in the five-match Border-Gavaskar Trophy series.""In a nutshell his scores of 0 and 161 in Perth explains his life. You can call his journey from zero to hero. When he came to Mumbai from a small town Bhadohi (Uttar Pradesh), he was zero. But over the years his relentless hard work with desire to succeed made him a hero. He is just 22 and with age on his side, he is poised to become one of the greatest batsmen of the world,"" said Chopra.The Delhi-based cricketer played just 10 Test matches but one of the highlights of his career was doing well in the 2003 series in Australia. He scored 186 runs in four Tests to help India draw the series 1-1.Regular captain Rohit Sharma and Shubman Gill are slated to make comeback in the second Test starting in Adelaide on December 6 and it means KL Rahul , who has done well in Perth, will have to come down the order.""When your name is Rahul, you are supposed to bat at any order. Rahul Dravid had done it before and now it is the turn of KL Rahul. I believe he will have to bat at No. 6 in the second Test where he batted most of his career. The momentum is with the Indian team after winning the opening Test quite convincingly. I am sure India will retain the BGT with their all-round performance,"" said Chopra.The 47-year-old feels next year's Champions Trophy, scheduled to be played in Pakistan, can't happen without India's participation. After India refused to travel to Pakistan, the ICC Champions Trophy 's future hangs in balance with the final call regarding its schedule to be made in the ICC board meeting on Friday.""The right choice should be made, and it is beyond our understanding what would be the right call.

The book launch was graced by External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar ""The way he plays, the kind of passion he has been showing over a period of time, and the way he has been playing and performing, it is brilliant.

Because one failure, it doesn't make you bad, but if you have the talent, I am sure things will only get better with time.""When asked if captain Rohit Sharma should open the batting in the Adelaide Test, he said, ""I am sure they will work it, they are in the middle of things.

NEW DELHI: South Africa's first Test against Sri Lanka at Kingsmead, Durban, turned into a spectacle of extraordinary bowling, with Marco Jansen stealing the spotlight on Thursday.Fresh from securing a mega Rs 7 crore deal with the Punjab Kings in the IPL 2025 auction held in Jeddah, the towering left-arm pacer delivered a career-defining performance, taking an astounding 7/13.This achievement marked the second-best figures by a left-arm fast bowler in Test cricket, firmly etching his name in the record books.Before this, Mitchell Johnson notched up eight wickets for 61 runs during South Africa's tour of Australia in 2008.After bundling South Africa out for 191 runs, Sri Lanka themselves faced a dismal batting collapse during their first innings, managing to score just 42 runs in 13.5 overs, the lowest Test total in their history.This also stands as the lowest total against South Africa in Test cricket.The innings, lasting a mere 83 deliveries, became the second-shortest in terms of balls faced, after South Africa's infamous 75-ball innings against England in 1924.Jansen was the architect of this debacle, tearing through Sri Lanka's batting lineup with unplayable deliveries.None of Sri Lanka’s batters managed to reach double digits, with Lahiru Kumara's 10 not out being the second-highest contribution after Kamindu Mendis 's 13. Kagiso Rabada (1/10) and Gerald Coetzee (2/18) provided excellent support to Jansen.South Africa’s first innings wasn’t without its challenges, as they managed a modest 191 runs.Skipper Temba Bavuma's fighting 70 and Keshav Maharaj's quickfire 24 stood out. Lahiru Kumara (3/70) and Asitha Fernando (3/44) led Sri Lanka’s bowling effort.The match has already set the tone for a thrilling series, with Jansen’s stellar display and Sri Lanka’s historic low taking centre stage.","South Africa's first Test against Sri Lanka turned into a spectacle of extraordinary bowling, with Marco Jansen stealing the spotlight.

NEW DELHI: Following Real Madrid 's 2-0 loss to Liverpool in the Champions League on Wednesday night, the Spanish club's team bus was involved in a traffic collision on the M40 motorway in England.Social media footage showed the stationary team bus crashed into a lorry (semi-truck). While no players or staff were aboard at the time, the vehicle was transporting the team's equipment and kit.Warwickshire Police issued a statement confirming they responded to reports of a collision involving a car, lorry, and the busof a ""well-known football team"" on the M40 southbound between junctions 16 and 15. No serious injuries occurred as the police noted the players were not on board the bus when the incident happened.“Our officers responded to reports of a collision involving a car, a lorry, and the coach of a well-known football team on the M40 southbound between junction 16 for Hockley Heath and junction 15 for Warwick. Fortunately, nobody was seriously injured. The players from the well-known football team were not on the coach at the time,"" the statement from Warwickshire Police reads.It is standard practice for teams to fly home immediately after European away matches.However, the team bus still needs to be driven back to the club's home city. The M40 would be the conventional route for a vehicle travelling from the northwest of England back towards the south coast of Spain.Real Madrid, the defending Champions League winners, suffered a disappointing 2-0 defeat at Anfield against Liverpool. Alexis Mac Allister and Cody Gakpo scored for Liverpool, while Kylian Mbappe missed a penalty for Real Madrid as his struggles continued.This was not the first time Real's team bus was involved in a crash.

KOLKATA: Monkey D Luffy, the famous manga and anime character, is an embodiment of strength, flexibility and quest for freedom – the three attributes of Alaaeddine Ajaraie that have taken Indian Super League ( ISL ) by storm en route his record-breaking show so far.So, the NorthEast United star’s chosen Luffy celebration after each of his 14 goals for the Highlanders — some of which were outrageous individual efforts — so far is not borne out of flippancy and the Highlanders fans have loved it each time, making it a trend on their social media handles.“I don’t watch anime too much, but I love this one. I liked the character of Luffy and that’s how I thought of doing this celebration,” Alaaedine said in an exclusive interview with. “I started it only this season because that is how I want people to remember me and when I see our Young Highlanders celebrate like me, it gives me happiness.”The 31-year-old – from a football-loving family with his father once a footballer in native Morocco – began his ISL sojourn with NEUFC after a lacklustre season in the Moroccan top tier, scoring just thrice in 29 appearances for his hometown club FAR Rabat.However, upon discussion with compatriots at NEUFC, Hamza Regragui and Mohammed Ali Bemammer, who told him about “the CEO, the head coach and the entire staff, who make everything possible”. Hence, Alaaeddine joined NEUFC on a one-year contract and was on song from his first game. His goalscoring spree that broke and bettered Brazilian Elano’s record of scoring consecutively in first six ISL games to eight, only took a break after 11 goals, in his ninth game of the league last week.“Frankly, I did not know about this record. After the game, I opened ‘Instagram’ and saw our club’s post. It makes me happy that my name is taken in the same breath as Elano, who has achieved so much in Indian football and football in general,” said ISL’s Player-of-the-Month for October.“I am happy that I have so far managed to help the team with 11 goals. It’s a long season and I am fully focused on my job of helping the team and without their help, I wouldn’t be able to score so many goals.”Head coach Juan Pedro Benali, who has had Alaaeddine on his radar courtesy the experience of working in Morocco, has also given his star attacker the freedom to play in different positions. And he has thrived as a striker, a winger or a No. 10 as his teammates have supported him in all the roles.The Moroccan’s scorching form has been a major factor in NEUFC’s best start to an ISL season and has catapulted them to the third spot on the league table, ahead of Friday’s clash against East Bengal here.“At NEUFC, we are a very good team, (with) nice people working to improve each day. So, if we continue the hard work and trust the process, we believe the results will take care of themselves,” the Moroccan opined. “The first step would be to qualify for the playoffs and then we take it from there. But for us, it’s always about one game at a time.”Having also plied his trade in Qatar, Alaaeddine also spoke of ISL as the perfect fit for his game.“ISL is a competitive league, and I felt that I could thrive here. I had offers from other clubs as well, but I chose NEUFC because of the good things I had heard,” he said. “The level of competition is very high in ISL. When I compare it with Qatar, I feel that the ISL is better for me as a player because of the high volume of quality players that makes it a tough league.”But his most memorable game is still the title-winning Durand Cup final against Mohun Bagan here, in which he had begun the second-half fightback for his team.“The Durand Cup final comes to my mind first. Everybody thought that Mohun Bagan would win the final. But the way we came back was special. It feels nice to win the first-ever trophy in the history of NEUFC,” said the 31-year-old.The Highlanders fans hope for more such adventures for their Luffy and more occasions to celebrate with their hero.","NorthEast United star Alaaeddine Ajaraie has scored 14 goals so far in Indian Super League.

CHENNAI: Chennaiyin FC head coach Owen Coyle has said that scouting players at a young age is critical and that tournaments like the Reliance Foundation Development League ( RFDL ) are much-needed as they provide a platform for youngsters to climb the ladder in Indian football.The RFDL 2024-25 season kicked off in Goa on Monday and features 54 teams, including sides from Indian Super League (ISL) and I-League clubs.It is to be remembered that some youngsters who are currently playing in the ISL – N Sivasakthi, Naorem Roshan Singh (both Bengaluru FC), Vibin Mohanan and Mohammed Aimen (both Kerala Blasters FC) – had competed in the RFDL before rising through the ranks.“With the population of India, I think that we have huge potential in football, especially at the youth level. Initiatives like the RFDL are the need of the hour to provide a much-deserved platform and opportunity for talented players,” said 58-year-old Coyle, who is into his fifth season in Indian football (first being 2019-20).“While the ISL is doing its part for the senior teams, I think that we must catch these talented players at a young age, provide them with the right kind of opportunities and enable them to make their way into the India national team,” added Coyle.A few months ago, Coyle had spoken about the importance of clubs producing and developing home-grown talent. “There is talent in India, there is no doubt about it. There should be more investment at the grassroot level; it is not about getting players when they are 16 or 17 years old. Players will have to be spotted at eight or nine,” Coyle had said.“I need to find a pathway for young players coming through (via the CFC development team). Nothing will please me more than getting young players from Tamil Nadu. That is important… you have them playing for Chennaiyin and TN. It will be great and amazing for everybody. It will also help associate better with the fans,” Coyle added.","Reliance Foundation Development League ( RFDL) kicks off in Goa on Monday.

KOLKATA: Dial ‘C’ when in trouble. And Bengaluru FC did just that to get past Mohammedan Sporting Club 2-1 in their ISL match at the Kishore Bharati Krirangan here on Wednesday.Down 0-1, Sunil Chhetri joined action in the 53rd minute and immediately made an impact by injecting momentum in the team’s attack. The former India international then made all the difference by scoring from the spot in the 82nd minute and finishing off things with a well-timed jump to head one that went in kissing Florent Ogier’s head in the added-on time. The victory saw BFC dethrone Mohun Bagan from the top of points table with 20 points, three more than Bagan playing a game less, from nine matches.Chhetri and records go hand-in-hand and on Wednesday the striker added one more by becoming the first player in ISL history to score against 15 different opponents.It was another heartbreak for Mohammedan who continued to wait for their maiden win at home once again suffering reverse late in a match.Contrary to the trend this season where Mohammedan have taken in four goals in the opening 15 minutes, it was the black-and-white brigade which drew first blood when an unmarked Cesar Manzoki headed in from a corner kick in the eighth minute of the match to put the hosts ahead.Stunned by the reverse, Bengaluru took time to settle down and started playing possession football to get a grip on proceedings. They came close to scoring when Argentina’s Pereyra Diaz back-heeled to Australian Dale Williams but the latter’s shot was timely blocked by Zuidika.Mohammedan too got their chance in the second half but Alexis Gomes, replacing Brazilian attacker Carlos Franca, hit back-to-back shots, which were negated by diving goalkeeper Gurpreet Singh before the second drinks break.Scorer Manzoki was guilty of grabbing Luis Pedro in a melee during a corner kick which forced referee Crystal John to award a penalty. Super-sub Chhetri equalised, placing the ball to the right of goalkeeper Bhaskar Roy. The 40-year-old showed glimpses of his vintage form when he anticipated a cross well and made a good connection that went in touching defender Ogier’s head silencing the home supporters.","Bengaluru FC dethrone Mohun Bagan from the top of points table with 20 points, three more than Bagan playing a game less.

Real Madrid's key attacking player for their Champions League match against Liverpool on Wednesday will be Kylian Mbappe , due to Vinicius Junior's injury.Real Madrid will face Liverpool at Anfield on Thursday in a crucial Champions League match, but they will be without Vinicius Junior. In addition to Junior's absence, Real Madrid has struggled in the tournament, losing two out of four games and currently sitting in 21st place.The French captain has had a difficult start in the Spanish capital, both on and off the field. However, he finally scored his first goal in five matches during Sunday's La Liga game against Leganes.Coach Carlo Ancelotti started Mbappe in his preferred left-wing position, and Mbappe rewarded him by scoring the opening goal at Butarque.It's worth noting that Vinicius created the scoring opportunity for Mbappe. With the Brazilian player sidelined for over three weeks, Mbappe will have to take on the responsibility of leading Real Madrid's attack, starting with the game at Anfield.Liverpool currently leads the Champions League group, while defending champions Real Madrid are in 18th place after surprising defeats to Lille and AC Milan in their first four matches.In those four matches, Vinicius scored four Champions League goals, while Mbappe has only scored once in the European competition.Mbappe has scored seven goals in 12 La Liga appearances, which isn't a poor record. However, given his superstar status, his overall performances have been somewhat underwhelming.The French forward, who was left out of his national team's squad for the last two international breaks, believes he is gradually finding his form.Real Madrid will be looking to improve their standing in the Champions League group table. Liverpool, on the other hand, will aim to maintain their lead.Sony Sports Network is the official broadcaster of the UEFA Champions League in India.

Punjab did exactly that on Tuesday, winning 3-0 at the Mumbai Football Arena to move into fourth spot with a smart tactical game. Panagiotis Dilmperis's side have 15 points from eight games, while Mumbai City remain in 10th spot with 10 points.It was a well-earned victory as Punjab not only neutralised the threat that the ISL Cup champions pose with their passing game but also effectively found the opportunities to score on either side of the half-time break. Their third goal in the 84th minute put a stamp of authority on their victory.Norbert Ezequiel Vidal put the visitors ahead with a left foot placement in added-on time of the first half. Immediately after the break, Mumbai City substitute Franklin Nazareth fouled Filip Mrzjlak inside the box and Luka Majcen stepped up to score from the spot in the 53rd minute. Punjab's third goal came from the foot of Norwegian forward Mushaga Bakenga , who shot from inside the box even as Mumbai's defence was guilty of being too slow to react.Punjab cut down the space that Mumbai's pacy wingers Lallianzuala Chhangte and Bipin Singh thrive in. Punjab played great defence, thanks to some robust play, and plonked two central midfielders ahead of their four-man defence to blunt the threats posed by Jon Miquel Toral Harper and Jayesh Rane, as Brandon Fernandes started on the bench.After the initial skirmishes, it was the Islanders who showed some keenness with a few moves and openings that tested the Punjab defence. But the visitors rode it. At times they even managed to isolate the Mumbai defence and it was one such move that provided Vidal with the opportunity to shoot from outside the box.After conceding the second goal, Mumbai pushed up, and with a quarter of an hour left, they seemed to have scored from a corner. Without the aid of VAR, however, it would have been asking a lot from the officials to notice that the ball seemed to have crossed the goalline as TV replays showed. Then came the third Punjab goal, leaving Mumbai City coach Petr Kratky to reflect on his team's first home loss in nine matches.","Norbert Ezequiel Vidal put the visitors ahead with a left foot placement in added-on time of the first half.

Pep Guardiola sustained cuts and scratches on his face during Manchester City’s 3-3 draw with Feyenoord in the UEFA Champions League , acknowledging that the fans had every right to boo the team following their dramatic collapse.City made history as the first team in Champions League history to lead by three goals as late as the 75th minute and still fail to win.After the match, Guardiola, sporting a cut on his nose and scratches on his forehead, explained that the injuries were self-inflicted, jokingly adding, “I want to harm myself,” before leaving the press conference.Josko Gvardiol was responsible for the first two goals conceded, but Guardiola quickly defended him. Despite this, the supporters expressed their frustration as City extended their winless streak to six games.“After the last game against Tottenham, where we lost 4-0, they were there supporting us, applauding. Of course, they’re disappointed. I’m not here to remind them of past successes; I’m here to see the team win and perform well. They support us consistently, and they’re right to express how they feel.”The draw marked the first time in Guardiola’s managerial career that one of his teams squandered a three-goal lead.Gvardiol, who had a poor performance against Spurs, was again at fault for the Dutch side’s first two goals. Guardiola emphasised Gvardiol's youth and potential, saying, “He is so young; he will learn. In the past, he was the best player on the pitch, but it would be wrong to blame him for our defeat. He is a fantastic player and needs support now more than ever.”Guardiola now faces the challenge of motivating his players ahead of their match against Premier League leaders Liverpool on Sunday, which will test their resilience.“There was no need to say anything to them; they know what happened,” he stated. “We had three opportunities to win, but it’s tough to accept. We’re struggling to win games. In previous years, we always found a way, but now, at 3-0, we couldn’t score the fourth or fifth, and it slipped away.”He reiterated his concerns from the 4-0 loss to Tottenham , highlighting that the team is currently “fragile” and unable to reach their usual defensive standards.",Pep Guardiola sustained cuts and scratches on his face during Manchester City's 3-3 draw with Feyenoord in the UEFA Champions League.

I was hoping to recover in two or three days, but it will take a few more days to heal completely. I didn't want to enter the tournament half-heartedly or with any niggles, so we decided to withdraw and focus on recovery."" He added that now they are targeting the Malaysia Open , India Open , and Indonesia Open in Jan after full recovery.""We played the Syed Modi tournament for the first time in 2016, and in 2018, we even reached our first final here, defeating our former coach, Mathias Boe, in the semis. It was memorable because it was the last time we faced Boe and Morgenson. As youngsters, it gave us a huge boost to play the finals here. I hope the tournament offers a similar experience for all athletes participating. I wish my fellow Indian players the very best and hope we win multiple finals,"" Chirag said.Reflecting on their stint at the China Masters, Chirag said, ""There were a lot of positive takeaways and no real drawbacks. When we entered the tournament, we weren't sure how far we could go since we were playing after almost three months, and Satwik was returning from an injury. Winning the first match against the Chinese Taipei pair was crucial, as was the victory against Denmark's Kim Astrup and Anders Skaarup Rasmussen in the quarterfinals.""""Reaching the semifinals was beyond our expectations, especially since we had practiced for only about a week before the tournament.

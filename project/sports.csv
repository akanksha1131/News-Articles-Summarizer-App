Suryakumar Yadav press conference: On India vs Pakistan, handshake drama, Asia Cup and more

A week after a controversy-filled clash at the Dubai International Stadium, India and Pakistan are preparing for another high-stakes Super Four meeting in the Asia Cup at the same venue. On Saturday, Pakistan received a morale boost when PCB chairman and Asian Cricket Council president Mohsin Naqvi visited the team during nets at the ICC Academy.In addition to Naqvi’s presence, the PCB has introduced a stress-management plan to ease pressure on players ahead of the contest. The board engaged motivational speaker Dr Raheel Ahmed, who joined the squad following the group stage. Ahmed has been working closely with the support staff, holding individual sessions with players struggling to handle the psychological demands of facing India. His focus has been to identify the causes of mental lapses in key moments.Pakistan have also raised eyebrows by cancelling their pre-match press conference for a second successive game, sparking speculation about unease within the camp.The tension stems from last Sunday’s match, where India beat Pakistan by seven wickets while chasing 128 in 15.5 overs. The encounter ended in controversy when Indian players declined to shake hands with their opponents. Captain Suryakumar Yadav explained it was a gesture of solidarity with the families of 26 victims of the Pakistan-backed Pahalgam terror attack earlier this year.The move angered the PCB, who blamed match referee Andy Pycroft for advising the captains to skip handshakes. Pakistan demanded his removal and even threatened to withdraw from the tournament, though the ICC twice dismissed their appeal.Frustration reached another level before Pakistan’s fixture against the UAE. The players were initially prevented from leaving the hotel as PCB officials debated the team’s participation. After an hour-long delay, clearance was granted and Pakistan went on to record a comfortable win to secure a Super Four spot.However, fresh trouble arose when a video surfaced showing Pycroft meeting the Pakistan camp before that match. The PCB claimed he apologised during the meeting, though the clip was muted. ICC later issued a stern email, accusing the board of multiple breaches of the PMOA protocol and clarified that Pycroft had only suggested the gathering to resolve tensions from the India game.",Pakistan face India in the Asia Cup Super Four clash at the Dubai International Stadium.

Poll How do you rate India's performance against Oman in the Asia Cup? Outstanding Good Average

NEW DELHI: India captain Suryakumar Yadav offered a candid reflection after his side’s 21-run win over a spirited Oman in their final Group A clash of the Asia Cup, admitting the conditions and circumstances were far from easy.“It’s a little difficult when you’re sitting and suddenly you come out and play. It’s so humid here,” Suryakumar said, after Harshit Rana (1/25 in 3 overs) and Arshdeep Singh (1/37 in 4 overs) went for runs on their return to the XI. Forced to rotate eight bowlers, the skipper was generous in his praise for the opposition. “Overall impressive. I feel Oman played (well). I knew with their coach, Sulu sir (Sulakshan Kulkarni), there will be khadoosness (stubbornness). It was amazing, really enjoyed watching them bat.”He described Hardik Pandya ’s run-out as “unfortunate” and revealed he had pushed himself down the order — even below Kuldeep Yadav, who batted at No.9 — just to give others time in the middle. With a smile, he added, “I will try to bat higher than No. 11 in the next game.” Sanju Samson , named Player of the Match for his 56 off 45 balls, relished his first substantial outing of the tournament. “It was humid and hot out there.Working on my fitness the last few weeks. We just got a new trainer and did the Bronco test. Good to see I got to spend some time in the middle. They (Oman) bowled really well. Have to give credit to Oman. Bowled well in the powerplay also, were swinging it upfront. I keep backing my strength to stay positive. Any contribution with the bat for your country, you have to take the positives.”Oman skipper Jatinder Singh was equally emotional, beaming with pride at his side’s fight. “I am extremely proud of the unit. The way they came up, they had their plans and executed them well. They were very much in the present. So proud of the way they have shown their character in the crunch situation. The hype of the tournament was there in the mind. We lack a little experience and exposure. This game was a blessing in disguise. We have a World Cup qualifier happening in Oman and the boys are ready. ”","India beat Oman by 21 runs in their final Group A clash of the Asia Cup.

Hridoy's aggressive batting included a 16-run over against Kamind Mendis, bringing Bangladesh closer to their target.Hassan's innings ended when he was dismissed by Hasaranga while attempting to accelerate. Hridoy continued the chase but fell to Dushmantha Chameera near the end.Bangladesh experienced some nervous moments in the final over, losing two wickets but ultimately crossed the finish line.Earlier, Sri Lanka's innings began strongly with Pathum Nissanka and Kusal Mendis putting up 44 runs in 5 overs. Nissanka scored 22 off 15 balls, while Mendis contributed 34 from 25 deliveries.The momentum shifted after Nissanka's dismissal, caught by Saif Hassan off Taskin Ahmed's bowling. Mendis soon followed, caught by Hassan off Mahedi Hasan's bowling.Kamil Mishara and Kusal Perera struggled to maintain the scoring rate, with Sri Lanka failing to find boundaries for nearly five overs.Bangladesh's bowlers, particularly Mahedi and Mustafizur Rahman, maintained tight control with their variations. Rahman emerged as the most successful bowler with figures of 3/20.Both Mishara and Perera departed in quick succession, leaving Sri Lanka at 97 for 4 in 13.4 overs. Mishara was bowled attempting a reverse lap against Mahedy, while Perera edged to keeper Liton Das off Rahman.Shanaka and Charith Asalanka (21) stabilized the innings with a 57-run partnership for the fifth wicket. Shanaka particularly targeted Nasum, hitting him for two sixes and a four in one over.The partnership ended with Asalanka's run out, but Shanaka finished strongly, scoring a four and six off Taskin in the final over to help Sri Lanka reach a competitive total.","Bangladesh beat Sri Lanka by four wickets in their Asia Cup Super Fours match.

Mandhana, who received a lifeline at 53, continued her aggressive batting.The momentum shifted when Harmanpreet was dismissed lbw after a medical break. Mandhana's departure in the following over affected India's chase significantly.Deepti Sharma's late effort of 72 runs off 58 balls, including five boundaries and two sixes, kept India's hopes alive.

Poll Is Messi the best player in MLS history? Yes No Not sure

Superstar Lionel Messi once again showcased why he is indispensable for Inter Miami, scoring two brilliant goals and creating another as his side defeated DC United 3-2 on Saturday at Chase Stadium in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. The victory keeps Miami firmly in the hunt for an MLS Cup playoff spot.Messi, 38, now has 22 goals in 22 matches this season, moving to the top of the MLS scoring chart after surpassing Sam Surridge of Nashville. This marked Messi’s seventh double of the campaign, highlighting his consistent brilliance.“It was another ordinary night for him, which is totally extraordinary for any other football player,” Miami coach Javier Mascherano said. “His ability not only to score but to make the team play, to find situations, and to carry the team on his shoulders when we needed him most — that is the advantage of having him.”Miami opened the scoring in the 35th minute when Messi threaded a precise through ball to Tadeo Allende, who slotted past DC United goalkeeper Luis Barraza. Christian Benteke equalised in the 52nd minute, but Messi soon restored Miami’s lead with a composed finish from Jordi Alba’s pass in the 66th minute.Messi added a third in the 85th, dribbling past defenders before curling a left-footed strike beyond Barraza. The goal proved crucial as Jacob Murrell scored in stoppage time to make it 3-2.Mascherano also praised Messi’s off-the-ball generosity. When 19-year-old Mateo Silvetti missed a penalty, Messi’s earlier assist had been a gesture to involve a teammate seeking his first goal, reflecting the Argentine’s leadership and team spirit.With the win, Miami climbed to fifth in the Eastern Conference with 52 points. Messi’s heroics not only kept Miami’s playoff hopes alive but also reinforced why the club is eager to extend his stay in Major League Soccer beyond next year.","Lionel Messi scored twice as Inter Miami defeated DC United 3-2.

Amorim relief

MANCHESTER: Manchester United eased the pressure on beleaguered boss Ruben Amorim with a chaotic 2-1 win against Chelsea as both teams finished with 10 men at Old Trafford.Fighting to avoid the sack after a woeful start to the season, Amorim received a welcome boost when Chelsea goalkeeper Robert Sanchez was sent off after just five minutes of Saturday's clash.Bruno Fernandes quickly put United ahead with his 100th goal for the club in all competitions in his 200th Premier League appearance.Casemiro doubled United's lead before the Brazil midfielder was dismissed for a second booking in first-half stoppage time.Trevoh Chalobah's late reply for Chelsea set up a tense finale, but United held on for just their second win in six matches in all competitions this term.Having kicked off languishing just above the relegation zone, Amorim's side climbed to ninth place to give the Portuguese coach a little breathing space.Amorim, who has won just nine of his 32 Premier League matches, shouldn't rest on his laurels just yet.After presiding over United's lowest top-flight finish since 1973-74 and a limp Europa League final loss to Tottenham last term, Amorim spent big in the summer to overhaul his moribund team.But United suffered an embarrassing League Cup exit at fourth-tier Grimsby in August before last weekend's 3-0 loss at Manchester City underlined the vast gulf to their rivals.Former Sporting Lisbon boss Amorim, who replaced the sacked Erik ten Hag in November, insists he retains the backing of co-owner Jim Ratcliffe after speaking to the British billionaire at the club's training ground on Thursday.Ratcliffe was in the directors box at rain-lashed Old Trafford to see if his support for Amorim was well placed.With storm clouds gathering for Amorim, he stuck with his much-criticised 3-4-3 formation after joking this week that even the Pope could not make him change his tactics.The move paid dividends as United made a flying start, with left wing-back Patrick Dorgu crossing for Bryan Mbeumo, whose header was saved by Sanchez.Just moments later, the erratic Sanchez rashly raced out of his penalty area in a bid to clear before Mbeumo could reach Benjamin Sesko's flick, but instead sent the United forward crashing to the turf with a reckless challenge.It was a clear red card for denying a goal-scoring opportunity and there were no complaints from Chelsea about their quickest ever Premier League dismissal.Filip Jorgensen replaced Sanchez in goal as Maresca took off wingers Estevao Willian and Pedro Neto in a defensive move that immediately backfired.United went for the jugular and Mbeumo volleyed just over after Fernandes's free-kick cannoned off the Chelsea wall.Amorim's men took the lead in the 14th minute when Fernandes, played just onside by Chalobah, timed his run perfectly to meet Dorgu's header with a clinical finish from four yards.Chelsea's misery mounted when England forward Cole Palmer was forced off with an apparent recurrence of a groin injury, making it a remarkable three substitutions in only 21 minutes for the Blues.For once, the luck was all going Amorim's way and Chelsea imploded to gift United their second goal in the 37th minute.Jorgensen stood rooted to the spot as Reece James's sliced clearance was headed on by Harry Maguire to Casemiro, who nodded home from close range for his first league goal in 11 months.Casemiro, booked for an earlier foul on Enzo Fernandez, saw red on the stroke of half-time after needlessly pulling back Andrey Santos.United struggled to find any rhythm in the second half and Chalobah reduced the deficit in the 80th minute when the unmarked Chalobah met James's cross with a powerful header that flashed past Altay Bayindir from 12 yards.It was too late to stop Chelsea slumping to their first league defeat this season as Amorim breathed a sigh of relief.",Manchester United beat Chelsea 2-1 at Old Trafford.

Red-hot Mbappe

In-form striker Kylian Mbappe netted again as Real Madrid beat Espanyol 2-0 on Saturday to extend their lead at the top of La Liga.Xabi Alonso's Madrid have won all five of their opening league fixtures and French superstar Mbappe has netted five goals in the top flight.Eder Militao opened the scoring with a screamer from distance after 22 minutes and Mbappe buried the second from outside the box early in the second half.Madrid are five points clear of second-place champions Barcelona, who host Getafe on Sunday.England international Jude Bellingham made a late appearance as a substitute in the final stages, his first since undergoing shoulder surgery in the summer.""We can't be doing any better,"" Madrid defender Dani Carvajal told Real Madrid TV.""The good thing is we're getting better at playing in the way the coach wants, understanding the concepts and the results are coming with that.""Carvajal was happy with the team's display, with Madrid showing more defensive solidity than at many times last season.""I think the performance was complete and we suffered very little in a defensive sense,"" continued Carvajal.""We're leaving as leaders, we're still at the top of the table and our objective was completed.""Mbappe, who netted twice from the penalty spot in midweek as Madrid started their Champions League campaign with a win over Marseille, helped Alonso's team maintain their 100 percent record across all competitions.His goal effectively killed the game after Militao head sent Madrid ahead.Alonso brought Vinicius Junior back into the side and gave young striker Gonzalo Garcia a rare start in an attacking line-up.Espanyol have not beaten Madrid at the Santiago Bernabeu since 1996 but have started this season well, arriving in the capital third.However their visit to face Los Blancos was a reality check and Madrid were comfortably on top throughout.Despite their dominance it took a ferocious drive into the top left corner from long range by centre-back Militao to break the deadlock.Mbappe fired narrowly wide after good work by Vinicius before half-time.The Brazilian has been benched on a couple of occasions by Alonso and is still playing below his best, although he set up Mbappe for the second.After driving forward with the ball Vinicius laid it off to Mbappe, who flashed a shot past Marko Dmitrovic at the near post from range.Vinicius hit the post after Espanyol's Serbian goalkeeper made a fine double save from Mbappe.Alonso brought on Bellingham and Eduardo Camavinga for their first games of the season in the final stages of a comfortable afternoon for Real Madrid.Earlier Levante romped to a 4-0 win at Girona, who finished with nine men.The Catalan minnows, who finished third in the 2023/24 campaign to reach the Champions League, are bottom, without a win this season.""After five weeks we are the worst team in the league and all we can do is work hard,"" said coach Michel Sanchez.""I have to improve this team and I will do it.

Liverpool maintained a perfect start in the Premier League after Ryan Gravenberch scored and assisted in a 2-1 win over Everton at Anfield on Saturday.Liverpool's record is 5-0 after the Merseyside derby.The host was listless and sloppy for long periods of the second half and Idrissa Gueye scored in the 58th minute for the Toffees, who lost for the first time since their opener at Leeds.Liverpool has won five consecutive home games against the Blues for the first time since 1933-37. Everton has not won a match at Anfield attended by fans since 1999, its only victory since then behind closed doors in 2021 during the pandemic.Everton manager David Moyes remained winless in 23 games at Anfield with the Toffees, Manchester United, Sunderland and West Ham.Liverpool’s top two summer signings, Alexander Isak and Florian Wirtz, entered as second-half substitutes, Wirtz in the 61st and Isak in the 67th.Gravenberch put Liverpool ahead in the 10th when Mohamed Salah lofted a one-hop pass into his path. The defensive midfielder extended his right leg and on the half volley lifted the ball over the outstretched arm of goalkeeper Jordan Pickford.Gravenberch made a perfect through-pass in the 29th and Hugo Ekitike slotted the ball through Pickford's legs and inside the far post.Gueye scored on a long-range shot after Iliman Ndiaye tapped back Jack Grealish's cross. About to turn 36 next Friday, Gueye became the second oldest Everton player to score in a Merseyside derby behind 37-year-old Sam Chedgzoy in 1926, according to Opta.Pressure mountingIn another bad day for West Ham coach Graham Potter, his team lost for the fourth time in five games, going down at home to Crystal Palace 2-1.Former Chelsea coach Potter has won just six times in 25 games since being hired in January and has lost 14 of them.The subject of insulting crowd chants at London Stadium, Potter said, “I didn’t hear it. I understand the frustration, but there’s nothing I can say.""He lasted only seven months at Chelsea and there has already been speculation in the British media about potential replacements, including former Nottingham Forest coach Nuno Espirito Santo and West Ham icon Slaven Bilic.When asked if he thought he had the backing of the club hierarchy, Potter said: ""I’ve no reason to think not. But I also understand the environment and the results.”Tyrick Mitchell scored a 68th-minute winner for Palace after Jean-Philippe Mateta's opening goal was canceled by Jarrod Bowen.West Ham was 18th in the standings with three points.Wolves still lastIt's even worse for Wolverhampton after losing at home to Leeds 3-1.Vitor Pereira's team was in last place and still looking for its first points after five games.Pereira signed a new contract at the club this week, but it looks like he's set for a tough season.Defeat came despite Ladislav Krejci firing Wolves ahead inside eight minutes.

But Richarlison halved the deficit before halftime and an own goal from Jan Paul van Hecke in the 82nd secured a point for Spurs.It's the second time this season Brighton has squandered a lead late on, having conceded a stoppage time equalizer in the 1-1 draw with Fulham on the opening day.Ange Postecoglou got his first point as Nottingham Forest coach in a 1-1 draw at Burnley.","Ryan Gravenberch scores and assists in Liverpool's 2-1 win over Everton.

U-23 players take the big leap

BENGALURU: India national football coach Khalid Jamil said his focus is the AFC Asian Cup qualifier against Singapore away on October 9.With the camp beginning here from Saturday, Jamil said, “We have to play as a unit. We have to prepare very well and just give our best,” Jamil said at a press conference along with India U-23 coach Naushad Moosa, senior women’s national team Crispin Chettri and women’s U-20 & -17 head coach Joakim Alexandersson.The coach said the team will have the services of Sunil Chhetri and defender Sandesh Jhingan, who is recovering from a jaw injury. “Sunil has done well last year. So I think this is the correct time to give him a game chance. And if the U-23 players are good, we will definitely choose them.”Moosa was happy to see his wards make the big stride. “This (senior India) squad had nine U-23 players.

They have that potential,” Moosa said.",India national football coach Khalid Jamil said his focus is the AFC Asian Cup qualifier against Singapore away on October 9.

15 eminent players to be part of football body’s general house with voting rights

Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel.

NEW DELHI/PANAJI: Replicating the BCCI constitution framework it had approved in 2018, the Supreme Court on Friday gave final shape to the constitution of All India Football Federation (AIFF) which debars ministers and bureaucrats from football management and imposes a 70-year-age cap on office bearers.A bench of Justices P S Narasimha and Joymalya Bagchi directed AIFF to convene a special general body meeting and adopt the draft constitution, as modified by the SC, within four weeks and hoped that it would make a new beginning for Indian football. The present governing body would continue till Sep 2026.The AIFF now has enough time on hand to convene a general body meeting – likely on Oct 14 in Goa – and adopt the constitution, which will beat FIFA’s threat of suspension “if there’s no definitive order from the Supreme Court and ratification of the constitution by the general body before Oct 30.”AIFF had pleaded for non-exclusion of public servants as well as MPs and MLAs — who could be sports people — from management of football. The bench in its 78-page judgment said any person who is a minister or a government servant would not be eligible to be an office bearer of AIFF.Writing the judgement, Justice Narasimha said the 15 eminent football players in the AIFF general body would have voting rights and rejected state association’s opposition to their voting right premised on the argument that these former players would enjoy over 25% of voting rights.“The argument of state associations regarding transgression of FIFA Statute lacks merit in as much as the Standard Statutes 2005 itself suggests the inclusion of experienced players with voting rights,” the bench said, adding that the model Sports Code does not prohibit eminent players from having more than 25% voting right.On public servants, the bench clarified that if they obtain requisite permission, they would be eligible to be in the AIFF governing body. It rejected petitioners’ plea for exclusion of office bearers of National Sports Federation from holding posts in AIFF. SC said an AIFF officer bearer would be disqualified if convicted and sentenced for more than two years, akin to the norms applicable to MPs and MLAs.As per the draft composition of AIFF, the general body would comprise one representative from every member association, 15 eminent players including five women elected from a national players body, three club representatives from ISL, I-League and Indian Women’s League, a male and a female representative from referees and two – male and female - from among coaches.Who could be in the category of eminent players? This posed a challenge to the SC as India does not have a sufficient pool of eminent players who have represented India in 15 competitive matches recognized by FIFA or Asian Football Confederation (AFC).The bench reduced the benchmark for eminent players – men must have represented India in five matches and women in two.The bench said any amendment “shall not be given effect” to without its approval, highlighting concerns that the approved constitution might be given a go-by, by the federation officials “if safety valves are not put in place.”",Supreme Court gives final shape to the constitution of All India Football Federation.

Poll What is your opinion on the handling of the situation by Liverpool FC? They are doing the right thing. They could have acted faster.

The Football Association has launched an investigation into alleged discriminatory language used by Liverpool Women’s goalkeeper Rafaela Borggrafe.According to reports from Britain’s PA news agency, the comments were overheard by teammates and staff during a recent squad photo-shoot. The matter was then raised internally before being referred to the FA.Liverpool confirmed the development in a statement on Friday. “The club has followed its protocols to the fullest extent and the alleged incident has been reported to the FA, which is conducting an investigation with our full support,” the statement read.“We condemn all forms of discrimination; it has no place in football or society. We are unable to comment further while the investigation is ongoing,” the club added.Borggrafe, 25, joined Liverpool in July from Freiburg on a free transfer but has yet to make her debut in the Women’s Super League. She was not included in the squad for the opening-day 4-1 defeat to Everton but returned to training afterwards and was listed as an unused substitute in last weekend’s 1-0 loss to Leicester City.Liverpool are scheduled to face Aston Villa in their next league fixture on Sunday.The FA has not provided a timeline for the outcome of its inquiry.Meanwhile, the senior men's side pulled off a thrilling late win over Atletico Madrid in the UEFA Champions League thanks to a late goal from Virgil van Dijk.

Poll Should Diego Simeone have reacted to the insults from Liverpool supporters? Yes, he was provoked. No, he should have remained calm.

Atlético Madrid coach Diego Simeone admitted he regretted his confrontation with Liverpool supporters during Wednesday’s Champions League clash at Anfield, though he insisted that his reaction was provoked by repeated insults from the stands.The heated exchange came moments after Virgil van Dijk struck a late winner to seal Liverpool’s 3-2 victory, shortly after Atlético had fought back from two goals down thanks to a Marcos Llorente brace. As celebrations erupted, Simeone turned towards the crowd behind his bench and clashed with fans, prompting stewards to intervene. Referee Maurizio Mariani then sent him off.Explaining the incident afterwards, Simeone said, “When they scored the third goal he turned around and insulted me. I’m a person, I’m human.”“They were shouting insults through the whole game from behind the bench and I cannot say anything as I am a coach. Obviously my reaction is not justifiable, I insulted him. But it was 90 minutes of being insulted the whole time then you turn around, when your opponent has scored, and they are still insulting you. It is not that easy,” he said after the game.Simeone declined to elaborate on the nature of the abuse, saying, “I am not really going to get into the exact nature of the insults.I don’t want to get into that discussion. I know what went on behind the manager’s bench. I cannot solve society’s problems in one press conference. I have to live with it because it happens all the time.”UEFA is awaiting the referee’s report before considering disciplinary action, but Simeone suggested Liverpool should also address the matter. “I hope that a team like Liverpool can improve that part. When they identify the person who did this, it should have its consequences. But the person who needs to stay calm, and take the insults, is me. In my place you just have to take it,” he said.","Diego Simeone was sent off in Atletico Madrid's 3-2 win over Liverpool.

How the three World Champions fared in Formula E Season 11

Days after Oliver Rowland lifted his Formula E World Championship trophy in London this season, an interesting trend has come to the attention of Formula E and its fans. As a coincidence, all Formula E drivers who won the Mexico City E-Prix went on to win the Formula E World Championship that season, and this has been proved right for three consecutive years.Highlighting the same since 2023, a poster of three World Champions was shared on X by Formula E with the caption, “The trend continues. Each winner of the #MexicoCityEPrix from the past three seasons has gone on to become World Champion.”The special poster features 2023 Formula E World Champion Jake Dennis from Andretti, then TAG Heuer Porsche’s Pascal Wehrlein, who won in 2024, and the new World Champion, Nissan driver Oliver Rowland. All three of them won in the Mexico E-Prix and went on to lift the winner’s trophy in the Formula E World Championship that year.Oliver Rowland had strengthened his chances of winning the Formula E World Championship this year much earlier. He was leading the Formula E Driver Standings ever since he won Part 2 of the Jeddah E-Prix, which was his second win of the season after winning the Mexico E-Prix. In the last leg, the Nissan driver got nervous for a while as Pascal Wehrlein, who was following him in the number two position, closed the gap after grabbing quite a few podiums while Rowland had a dull period.Things became serious for Rowland when he failed to finish the Round 13 race in Berlin, while Wehrlein won second spot on the podium. But he eventually managed to confirm his championship in Berlin after four wins and three more podiums.Sharing about his bad race in Berlin, Rowland had said, “I was hoping before the weekend that the outcome could be [the World Championship], but after yesterday (Saturday) and this morning (Sunday), I was more worried that it might never come.”Also Read: Oliver Rowland reacts to daughter’s sweet radio message after Formula E Championship win: “It’s amazing” Things, however, changed for Wehrlein, who was pushed to third position after Nick Cassidy made a late entry in the Formula E Driver Standings by registering three consecutive wins.

Taylor Barnard on losing top three spot in Formula E World Championship

Fans hail Taylor Barnard for his fantastic rookie season

It was Taylor Barnard’s rookie season this year, and the NEOM McLaren driver put up a fantastic performance by temporarily making it to the top three in the Formula E Driver Standings by ousting the much more experienced Porsche driver Antonio Felix Da Costa. He was, however, ousted from the top three at the London E-Prix as Jaguar’s Nick Cassidy went on to register three consecutive wins. Barnard took to Instagram to share his feelings on losing out on the top three in his first-ever season and his claim to the championship.Taking to Instagram after the London E-Prix, Barnard wrote, “London wasn’t what we hoped for, easily being the toughest weekend of our season. Taking 0 points away as a team from a doubleheader hurts, but one weekend doesn’t define the year we’ve had.”He further wrote, “As the season closes, I want to say a massive thank you to the entire team, both trackside and behind the scenes, for everything this season. Finishing P4 in the Drivers’ Championship and coming into the final weekend with a shot at runner-up is something to be proud of.”Also adding a note for teammate Sam Bird, as NEOM McLaren withdrew from Formula E after the end of the season, Barnard wrote, “@sambird_official it wasn’t the weekend you deserved either.You’ve been a huge part of my season both on and off the track, and I’m grateful for everything. You deserved more. To all the Papaya fans, thank you for the incredible support in our final race together. You always go above and beyond. ”Reacting to his post, a fan wrote, “An incredible debut season, huge congrats and excited to see where you go next!” Another said, “I know I said it the other day, but you’ve been incredible to watch this last year and a pleasure to support you in Papaya — there are many of us that can’t wait to support you in whatever you do next!” One more commented, “You were incredible all season around, Taylor.

Through the early days, the good days, the bad days, and the great days, we have always felt an overwhelming amount of support from you all.”For the partners associated with the team, he wrote, “They say that ‘racing is a state of mind’, and since its inception, this team has had the privilege of working for organisations, with partners, and racing for fans who fully embrace this philosophy.This is certainly true of those at McLaren, whose passion for racing is second to none.”“My heartfelt thanks go out to everyone who has been involved: those at McLaren who backed us, the fans who supported us, and the partners who allowed us to go racing. We couldn’t have done it without you all — your trust and support have never been taken for granted,” he added.Praising the two McLaren drivers, he wrote, “Sam clinched McLaren’s first-ever fully electric win at the São Paulo E-Prix in Season 10, pulling off one of Formula E’s all-time great overtakes, before being waved across the line by none other than Emerson Fittipaldi – McLaren's first Formula 1 World Champion. While Taylor has been a rookie sensation in Season 11, securing five Formula E records, including the youngest driver to start a race, the youngest points scorer, the youngest driver to lead a lap, the youngest podium finisher, and the youngest polesitter. ”He ended the letter saying, “Some of us have been together since the day we first launched this team, while others have seamlessly fitted in along the way and flourished within the environment we have cultivated. For many, I am sure that we will cross paths again soon, but whatever the future holds for those here at Bicester, whatever path they choose to follow, I have no doubt that it will be bright. Their potential is limitless. ”Reacting to the open letter on Instagram, Taylor Barnard wrote, “It’s been an honour to wear Papaya and represent this team.” Sam Bird also dropped a heart emoji and a hands-joined-in-prayer emoji in the comments section.Also Read: Taylor Barnard looks back at rookie season at McLaren: “Every step has been unforgettable” Neither Taylor Barnard nor Sam Bird has revealed their future course of action in Formula E Season 12.

How do Formula E and ABB work together?

What do ABB and Formula E say about the partnership?

After a successful Season 11, ABB and Formula E have announced that they will continue their partnership in the upcoming season. This gives ABB another opportunity to promote its new brand positioning via the ABB FIA Formula E World Championship, along with technologies that help industries take a cleaner route.Over a period of eight seasons, the partnership with Formula E has provided ABB a platform to showcase how technology can help industries outrun challenges, engage with customers around the world, and implement its own solutions into the series to improve reliability and efficiency. The partnership extension will provide a year-round opportunity for brand-building and activation, communicating ABB and its technology solutions to new global audiences, including Formula E’s international fanbase.ABB and Formula E will also join hands to engage a new generation of fans, collaborating with unexpected influencers and content creators to tell compelling stories that make advanced electrification and automation technologies tangible and exciting.The end of the mid-race car swap, a 150kW increase in power, top speeds that are 43 percent higher, and energy recovery increasing from 15 to 50 percent indicate how far Formula E technology has come to outperform on track.ABB has also built on its technical involvement in the series, supplying the race chargers from Season 9, and introducing its ABB Ability OPTIMAX® energy management software (Season 9) and Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) technology (Season 5) to the sport.ABB Head of Brand Paco Liebrand said, “We are pleased to be continuing our partnership with Formula E which, like ABB, is striving for a leaner and cleaner future. The synergy between the two organizations, combined with the global appeal of the Championship, makes it a great platform to promote our brand positioning.”He further said, “Formula E is increasingly working with content creators, influencers, and celebrities, with initiatives such as the Evo Sessions making an impact through digital channels beyond the racing itself, which is also an essential part of ABB’s new brand strategy. Going forward, we will be enhancing the way we harness the benefits of this collaboration, ensuring the focus is on delivering content and activations that reinforce our new messaging, build familiarity, and tell the ‘Engineered to Outrun’ story. ”Formula E Chief Revenue Officer Tiziana Di Gioia said, “Our renewed partnership with ABB is a testament to the commercial power and benefit of Formula E as a global platform that drives both brand and business growth. ABB, like our wider partnership portfolio, has and continues to see enormous value in collaborating with the fastest-growing motorsport on the planet, with viewership, commercial integration, and brand storytelling continuing to accelerate. Over eight seasons, ABB has moved from brand visibility to brand activation—integrating deeply into the fan experience, the sport’s ecosystem, and our innovation narrative.Also Read: Antonio Felix Da Costa shares happy memories as Porsche wins Formula E Teams and Manufacturers’ World Championships “This next chapter elevates the partnership even further. With ABB’s new positioning, we are co-creating opportunities across content, digital storytelling, and market engagement, transforming a title partnership into a year-round, value-generating relationship. It’s a model of how modern sponsorships should evolve, rooted in purpose and cultural alignment but measured by impact,” she added.Formula E Season 12 will begin with testing in Valencia in October.","ABB and Formula E have announced that they will continue their partnership in the upcoming season.

Poll Do you think it’s important for public figures like Bjorn Borg to share personal struggles with addiction? Absolutely, it can inspire others Yes, but only if they feel comfortable Not really, it's their personal life

Swedish tennis icon Bjorn Borg has made a deeply personal revelation in his newly released autobiography Heartbeats: A Memoir, published on Thursday, disclosing his long-hidden battles with cocaine addiction and a recent prostate cancer diagnosis.The 69-year-old former world No.1, who dominated tennis in the 1970s and early 1980s, confessed that his first experience with cocaine in the early 1980s at New York’s legendary nightclub Studio 54 gave him “a rush as strong as what tennis had given me in the past.”His darkest years, Borg recounts, came in the 1990s when he was living in Milan with then-wife, Italian singer Loredana Bertè. “We had bad influences, and… drugs and pills within reach. There, I was plunged into the deepest darkness,” Borg writes.The low point arrived in 1996, when Borg collapsed on a bridge in the Netherlands just before an exhibition tournament. “When I awoke in hospital, my father was standing next to me. He said nothing, it was so embarrassing. I was terribly ashamed,” he told Swedish talk show Skavlan.In the memoir, Borg also reveals that he was diagnosed with prostate cancer in September 2023.“The risk of it coming back still exists, and it’s something I will have to live with… with the anxiety of not knowing if the cancer was caught in time,” he wrote, adding that he undergoes check-ups every six months.Despite his health challenges, Borg stressed that he exercises daily, though he admitted he has not “played tennis in six years.”The 11-time Grand Slam champion also touched on doping in modern tennis, expressing concern about junior players and questioning Jannik Sinner’s decision to rehire fitness coach Umberto Ferrara after the Italian’s brief suspension for a steroid violation.Borg, who retired shockingly at just 26 after conquering Wimbledon five times and the French Open six times, said his memoir is about confronting demons, shame, and survival.",Tennis great Bjorn Borg has released his autobiography Heartbeats: A Memoir.

The former Kenyan Davis Cup player Eno Polo has been appointed as the new chief executive of the ATP, the governing body for the men's professional tennis circuit announced on Wednesday.The 58-year-old, who reached a career high ranking of 574 in 1990, succeeds Massimo Calvelli ""with immediate effect"" after the Italian stepped down in June following more than five years in the role.""Since 2021, he has served as a player representative on the ATP board of directors,"" the statement said.""Polo will oversee the ATP's global operations and continue to drive OneVision - a transformative plan designed to grow the sport, elevate fan engagement, and deliver long-term value for players, tournaments, and partners across the Tour.""He will lead the ATP alongside the organisation's Italian president Andrea Gaudenzi, who has been in office since 2020.""Eno is a dynamic and accomplished leader who understands both the commercial landscape and the intricacies of professional tennis,"" said Gaudenzi in Wednesday's ATP statement.Polo was born and raised in Kenya and represented the national team before embarking on an international business career which has landed him senior leadership roles at sports equipment manufacturer Nike, Italian football club Juventus, sandal manufacturer Havaianas and the Premier Padel circuit.""Tennis is at a transformative moment as a global sport and business,"" said Eno.

"Tennis legend Boris Becker's prison experience: Poker debt, confrontations, life lessons, and more",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/top-stories/tennis-legend-boris-beckers-prison-experience-poker-debt-confrontations-life-lessons-and-more/articleshow/123899864.cms,"Boris Becker (Photo by Gerald Matzka/Getty Images)

In one of the latest Daily Mail stories, Boris Becker recalls utilising his ability to read opponents during his tennis career, noting how he could identify weaknesses in players like Ivan Lendl and Stefan Edberg.This skill proved valuable during his time at Huntercombe prison near Henley-on-Thames in Oxfordshire, where he served time for Insolvency Act violations.In September 2022, after serving five months of his two-and-a-half-year sentence, Becker joined a poker game with Romanian inmates that would lead to a dangerous situation.As a foreign national, Becker was offered early release through deportation after serving half his sentence, allowing him to potentially spend Christmas with his partner Lilian.The poker games, played with matchsticks representing money, resulted in Becker accumulating a supposed debt of £500 to the Romanian inmates.For Becker, who had been a millionaire since age 17 and regularly earned millions annually, £500 would have been insignificant outside prison. However, inside it represented about eight months of weekly allowance.Two Romanian inmates visited Becker's cell demanding payment, followed by a warning from Bogdan, another Romanian inmate known for killing two men.""Boris, this guy's a little crazy. And you got to find a way to pay soon, because otherwise you're going to see how crazy he can be,"" Bogdan warned Becker.Becker arranged for a bank transfer to settle the debt without informing Lilian of the situation.A new inmate named Zac arrived at the prison, wearing a rubber cap and rumored to have mental health issues.One day, Becker confronted Zac for being in his friend Ike's cell without permission, leading to a threatening confrontation.""I'm going to f- you up. I'm going to break your head. I'm going to slit your throat. I'm going to kill you,"" Zac shouted at Becker.Fellow inmates, including Shuggy and others, intervened to protect Becker during the confrontation.Ike, a drug dealer who had become Becker's friend, later explained that Zac had spent 17 years in Belmarsh prison for murder and was mentally unstable.Three days after the incident, Zac apologized to Becker in the laundry room, kneeling and kissing his hand.""I disrespected you,"" Zac said, acknowledging both Becker and Ike's influence in the prison.Becker later played chess with Zac, deliberately losing to avoid further confrontation.Andy Small, the prison warden who taught Stoicism, had warned Becker about the exhausting nature of navigating prison relationships.Becker received numerous letters of support, including a message from Liverpool manager Jürgen Klopp, though Klopp's attempts to visit were denied by prison authorities.Lilian was eventually permitted three monthly visits, with wardens allowing limited physical contact during these meetings.Shuggy became Becker's barber, cutting both his hair and beard, requiring significant trust given the use of sharp implements.On Becker's 55th birthday, he received unexpected kindness from fellow inmates, including three separate birthday cakes from Ike, Shuggy, and Alex, an Albanian inmate.The inmates also presented Becker with a handmade birthday card, marking a stark contrast to his previous milestone birthdays.Becker's release was arranged for December 14, with plans to depart via private jet to Germany.He distributed his belongings to fellow inmates the day before his release, sharing knowing glances with Ike and Shuggy.At 6 AM on release day, Becker was escorted to Biggin Hill airport, where he reunited with Lilian.They successfully avoided media attention by landing in Stuttgart instead of Munich or Frankfurt.After his release, Becker struggled to adjust to normal life, continuing to sleep on the edge of beds as if still in his prison cot.Becker and Lilian eventually settled in Milan, Italy, starting fresh with minimal possessions.The experience helped Becker recognize the need for significant life changes, leading to his marriage to Lilian on the Italian Riviera.The article concludes with an account of Pat Cash visiting Huntercombe Prison to discuss Stoicism, leading to a reconciliation between the former tennis rivals.","Boris Becker served five months of his two-and-a-half-year sentence.

CHENNAI: Dhakshineswar Suresh has swiftly captured the spotlight in Indian tennis circles. In a twist few saw coming, the 25-year-old was drafted into India’s Davis Cup main squad from the reserves for the tie against Switzerland, a bold move by captain Rohit Rajpal that paid off.Any doubts were put to rest when world No. 626 Suresh, on his debut, stunned Jerome Kym – ranked 471 places above him –with a commanding performance. Kym entered the competition on the back of a third-round appearance at the US Open. The big-serving Suresh laid the foundation for India’s progress to the Davis Cup Qualifiers.Hailing from Madurai, the 6feet-5-inch tall Suresh was mentored by Somdev Devvarman at the Aspire academy in Chennai. During the Covid-19 pandemic, Suresh moved to the USA to pursue his dreams. The journey was not without its challenges; in 2020, he suffered a severe back injury and was barely able to walk. With the pandemic raging and the injury sidelining him, he lost precious years.However, Suresh never gave up. He continued to overcome challenges and has now become the toast of the nation. Several Indian players, including Somdev Devvarman and Mahesh Bhupathi, used the collegiate route to enhance their careers and Suresh has taken a similar route.An undergraduate student of the Wake Forest University in Winston Salem, Suresh drew attention in recent months, defeating two top-150 players en route to the Lexington Challenger quarterfinals. He later pulled off a major upset by defeating the then world No. 126 Alejandro Tabilo to reach the main draw of the ATP 250 Winston Salem Open.Despite his low ranking, Suresh was able to enter Challenger events by being among the top collegiate players, who were granted direct entry through the ATP Next Gen Accelerator programme. Interestingly, it was Somdev who guided Suresh on his move to the USA, and Somdev’s coach during his time at the University of Virginia, Tony Bresky, is now Suresh’s head coach.The two (Suresh and Somdev) first met during a pre-season camp in 2016 in Chennai, where the latter was impressed by Suresh’s talent. Somdev went on to mentor Suresh for several years and, most recently, had a short training stint with him in May.“DK (Suresh) is a part of an incredibly good system and environment. He has been playing in high-pressure matches for the past few years and that is why he looked as comfortable as he did out there (Davis Cup). It has been a long time coming because we have known his talent for a long time. There were tough times and he had different challenges. Credit to him for the work he has put in. He is just getting started and I will say with 100 per cent confidence that the best is yet to come and there is no question about it,” Somdev told TOI.While Suresh is known for his big service games, he put on an all-round show against Kym. He capped off the first set with a deft lob over Kym on set point. And he used his backhand to good effect, an area that needed improvement last year. “I have always been a believer in improving strengths. I think all the great players back themselves in what they do best. Take a look at his strengths – hitting the ball big, serving huge, and being intimidating to play against. These are the things that he should focus on. If you go out there and hold serve six times against anyone, you have got a chance.”","Dhakshineshwar Suresh was drafted into India’s Davis Cup main squad from the reserves for the tie against Switzerland.

India secured a historic spot in the Davis Cup Qualifiers after Sumit Nagal defeated young Henry Bernet in the first reverse singles, leading to a 3-1 victory over Switzerland in the World Group I tie on Saturday.The day began with N Sriram Balaji and Rithvik Bollipalli suffering a close defeat in the doubles rubber against Jakub Paul and Dominic Stricker, with scores of 7-6 (3) 4-6 5-7 in a match lasting two hours and 26 minutes.The Swiss team made a strategic change by fielding junior Australian Open champion Bernet instead of Jerome Kym for the crucial fourth rubber against Nagal, which the Indian won convincingly with scores of 6-1 6-3.India entered the day with a 2-0 lead following impressive singles victories by Nagal and newcomer Dhakshineshwar Suresh on Friday.This victory marks India's first triumph over a European team in an away tie since their win against France in the 1993 quarterfinals, led by Leander Paes and Ramesh Krishnan.India's previous European success came against Denmark in a home tie played on grass courts in Delhi in 2022.The first round of Davis Cup Qualifiers is scheduled for January 2026.Bernet's aggressive playing style resulted in numerous unforced errors, which worked in favor of the Indian player.""It means a lot. It's been a while that we won in Europe. We worked very hard to be here. We pushed each other, I am very happy with the win,"" said Nagal.""Doubles was tough, the level of tennis was very high from both teams. I was sweating more on the sidelines than playing this match. The young ones are always tricky, you don't know what's coming your way.""This was Nagal's return to Davis Cup competition since his last appearance against Morocco in September 2023, and his presence proved influential.The victory represents captain Rohit Rajpal's first significant achievement since taking over from Mahesh Bhupathi in 2019, particularly notable for being won on foreign soil.The 18-year-old Bernet started slowly, losing his serve in the opening game, but later showed promise with his single-handed backhand producing impressive corner winners.Nagal gained a crucial break point when Bernet failed to execute a half volley at 30-all while approaching the net, giving the Indian player a 4-1 advantage.The first set concluded with Bernet committing a double fault on set point, which came after a forehand error.Nagal maintained his momentum in the second set, securing an early break and maintaining the advantage until victory was sealed with Bernet's return going long.In the earlier doubles match, both Balaji and Stricker demonstrated excellent serving skills initially, holding their serves without dropping points.The Indians challenged Paul's serve but the Swiss player managed to hold after reaching deuce.The Indian pair earned three break points on Stricker's serve in the sixth game, converting the third opportunity when Stricker hit the net following an extended baseline rally with Balaji.The Swiss team recovered by breaking back when serving for the first set, capitalizing on Balaji's forehand return error at 30-all.The tiebreaker remained close at 3-3 before Paul's consecutive errors gave India the advantage.The second set remained competitive with both teams level at 4-4 after navigating through challenging moments.Despite having opportunities, including a crucial break point chance at 30-all in the ninth game, Balaji couldn't capitalize on them.The teams engaged in an intense six-deuce game, which Paul eventually won when Balaji's return went long.Bollipalli lost his serve in the following game, leveling the match at one set each.An early break put India in a favorable position, but Bollipalli faced pressure and needed three aces on deuce points to hold serve.Stricker earned a break back opportunity with a service return winner on Balaji's serve, which was converted following a double fault.The match concluded when Bollipalli, serving to stay in contention, started with a double fault and backhand error, followed by Paul's forehand winner setting up three match points, with victory secured on Bollipalli's netted return.",India beat Switzerland 3-1 in Davis Cup World Group I tie on Saturday.

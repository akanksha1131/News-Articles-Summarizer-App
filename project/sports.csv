Poll What do you think about the gesture of Zoravar Singh Sandhu's coaches shaving their heads? It's a fun and motivating bet. It shows great team spirit. It's too extreme for a bet. I don't think it adds any value.

Zoravar Singh Sandhu’s trap bronze at the World Championships in Athens on Friday was historic — though calling it a hair-raising performance might be a tad too much.Yet, it proved hairrazing for a few. The medal cost some men their hair — his coaching team, to be precise.The group included London Olympics gold medallist-turned-coach Peter Wilson, who boldly fulfilled his promise of shaving his head if any of his shooters won a medal at the Worlds. The Briton, along with fellow coaches Anwer Sultan (a former Asian medallist) and sports psychologist Tejaswi Karanwal, went bald to honour the bet they lost to “Zor,” as the veteran shooter is known.“It’s not that they didn’t have confidence in us,” Zoravar told TOI from Athens.“They knew we were talented and felt that their challenge could motivate us. I won the medal, and they very graciously obliged by shaving their heads. Peter is a great guy and inspires his shooters in different ways — this is one gesture everyone will remember.”Zoravar, 48, has been shooting for over three decades. His bronze is only the third medal for India in trap at the Worlds after Karni Singh’s silver in 1962 and Manavjit Singh Sandhu’s gold in 2006.“This was a tough medal to win. The range was tricky, with light changing rapidly — one shot it’s bright, the next it’s dark,” he said.Zoravar last won an individual world-level medal in 2007, a bronze at the Changwon World Cup. Competing now alongside teammates half his age, he says he draws inspiration from their energy.“They are all very young and work really hard. That keeps me motivated to do well too,” he added.","Zoravar Singh Sandhu's trap bronze at the World Championships in Athens on Friday was historic.

Poll What do you think of Tanvi Sharma's performance at the BWF World Junior Championships? Outstanding, she showed great potential Good, but could improve under pressure Average, not what I expected Disappointing, she should have won gold

After playing a pivotal role in helping India win a historic bronze in the team event of the BWF World Junior Championships, Tanvi Sharma played her heart out to reach the girls’ singles final in Guwahati.With gold in sight, the 16year-old eventually fell short, going down to Thailand’s Anyapat Phichitpreechasak 7-15, 12-15 in the summit clash at the National Centre of Excellence on Sunday.“I am very happy with the silver medal but a little disappointed that I didn’t get the gold. I played very well and was confident about the final also, but it didn’t happen,” Tanvi told TOI after the match.Despite the heartbreak, she became only the fifth Indian to bag a silver in the competition after Aparna Popat (1996), Saina Nehwal (2006), Siril Verma (2015) and Sankar Muthuswamy (2022).Anyapat, who Tanvi had beaten in the semifinals of the 2023 Badminton Asia U17 & U15 Junior Championships, did not allow the Indian to settle this time, taking the first game in just nine minutes. In the second, Tanvi led 6-1 and 8-5 at the break, but a string of errors and mounting pressure saw the Thai opponent seize control again.“I was in a comfortable position, but suddenly I started making mistakes. I also got nervous because of the big stadium and the crowd,” said Tanvi, who has been training at the NCE for a year now.Her coach Park Taesang kept urging her to play long rallies, but the momentum had already swung. “He told me to play my game and stay in the rallies to get points. There are days when I make these mistakes, so I need to work on that — especially on my net play and endurance,” she said.Tanvi’s performance over the past week, however, has been a huge positive for India’s junior badminton setup. Her poise, movement, and shot selection throughout the event have impressed coaches and selectors alike, marking her out as one of the most promising shuttlers to emerge from the new National Centre of Excellence programme.Having already shown her ability to handle pressure on the world stage, the teenager now aims to break into the senior circuit. “This result gives me confidence that I can compete at the next level,” Tanvi said. “I’ll keep improving and work on consistency so I can do well in the senior tournaments too.”Tanvi credited her mother Meena and coach Park for their unwavering support. “My coach was very happy after the semifinal and asked me to just play my game in the final without thinking about the result. My mother has always guided me and travels with me everywhere,” she added.As for the boys’ singles final, China’s Liu Yang Ming Yu beat top seed Mohd Zaki Ubaidillah of Indonesia 15-10, 15-11 to clinch the title. China’s Tan Ke Xuan and Wei Yue Yue took the girls’ doubles crown, while Korea’s Lee Hyeong Woo and Cheon Hye In won the mixed doubles title.","Tanvi Sharma loses to Thailand’s Anyapat Phichitpreechasak 7-15, 12-15 in the summit clash at the National Centre of Excellence in Guwahati.

Axar, Rahul infuse momentum

Australia’s forward Marsh

Poll What do you think contributed most to India's defeat in the first ODI? Underperformance of key players like Rohit and Kohli Ineffective bowling attack Poor conditions due to rain interruptions Strong performance by the Australian team

The numerous rain breaks made it a long day in Perth. But for many who curtailed their pre-Diwali Sunday morning slumber to catch up on the action, the day was done around breakfast time. The seven-wicket defeat at 4.40 pm IST was more academic as the Aussies went 1-0 up in the three-match series.Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli, looking to prolong their international careers till the 2027 ODI World Cup, looked rusty in their combined stay of 22 balls at the crease at a time when the sun was still out. The interrogation around the off-stump by Josh Hazlewood and Mitchell Starc that curtailed their Test careers 11 months ago proved too much for the two greats even with the white ball. Rohit (8) nicked Hazlewood’s delivery that jumped a bit from a good length, and Matt Renshaw at slip had an easy grab.Starc bowled a few slightly full to Kohli, walking in at No. 3, and then held the length back just a bit for one. It got the outer half of the 51-ton man’s bat, and Cooper Connolly at gully did the needful. Reduced to 21-2 in 6.1 overs—a run-rate that read ridiculously low for those getting used to Abhishek Sharma’s diet in Powerplay—it was crucial that captain Shubman Gill got going.But Gill (10) nicked one down the leg by medium-pacer Nathan Ellis on his first ball, and the task got all the more uphill for the rest of the batting unit. It was around this time that the heavens opened up for the first time, and the stoppages kept repeating in a loop, with overs getting curtailed.There was a bit of interest around new vice-captain Shreyas Iyer as well, but he too, in between the stoppages, failed to negotiate his nemesis—the short ball around his armpits. Iyer (11) nicked Hazlewood (2-20), who hit an impeccable length and bowled seven overs on the trot, and wicket-keeper Josh Phillippe completed a smart catch.Amidst these mishaps, the class of KL Rahul shone through once again. Not too long ago, he was busy guiding India to a Test series win on a slow turner at Kotla. The Optus pitch is as far removed from Kotla as New Delhi is from Perth, but it was hardly a bother for the Bengaluru boy. Rahul (38 off 31 balls) didn’t look perturbed by the quality of the Aussie pace attack or the rain breaks, as the match finally settled down to be a 26-over affair. The right-hander’s 39-run partnership with the gutsy Axar Patel (31) did infuse a little bit of life into the Indian innings, but the damage was already done. Still, they did unleash the odd powerful shot, and one can hope once the conditions get easier in Adelaide, things will get better for the Indian batters.To make a 131-run target look menacing, India needed more than the odd wicket in the initial overs. But on the Optus pitch, which had become quite spicy with the moisture and the lights coming on, India sorely missed Jasprit Bumrah. Mohammed Siraj was his usual wholehearted self while Arshdeep Singh had Travis Head early, but the Indian attack lacked the cutting edge that could run through Australia.Skipper Mitchell Marsh 46* (52 b), after initial belligerence, curtailed himself after a couple of wickets, knowing well that there is a lot of inexperience around the Australian middle-order. Among the pacers, Harshit Rana (027 off 4) was the most disappointing, dishing out the odd loose ball every over, which took the pressure off Marsh and the young Phillippe (37). Their 55-run third-wicket stand killed the game.By the end, it became a stroll in the park. Like the Aussies had on Nov 19, 2023.","Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli looked rusty in their combined stay of 22 balls at the crease.

NEW DELHI: India captain Harmanpreet Kaur described her team's narrow four-run defeat to England as ""heartbreaking"", admitting that despite dominating large parts of the contest, they once again failed to cross the finish line in their Women's World Cup group encounter on Sunday. With Smriti Mandhana scoring a fluent 88 and India needing just 56 runs off 54 balls with seven wickets in hand, they seemed on course for victory. But England fought back brilliantly, securing their fourth successive win and confirming a semifinal berth alongside Australia and South Africa.""Smriti's wicket was the turning point for us. It’s a heartbreaking moment,"" Harmanpreet said at the post-match presentation.While Mandhana and Harmanpreet were at the crease, India appeared in control, but neither could anchor the chase.Earlier, Heather Knight’s 109 had anchored England’s total of 288/8, before India fell agonisingly short at 284/6. Left-arm spinner Linsey Smith triggered a collapse, dismissing Mandhana against the run of play. Deepti Sharma’s composed fifty had kept India’s hopes alive after Mandhana’s departure, but Sophie Ecclestone’s dismissal of the all-rounder in the closing overs sealed England’s victory.""It’s a bad feeling when you have put so much hard work in but the last 5-6 overs didn’t go according to the plan,” Harmanpreet added.“We still had batters, but I don’t know how things went the other way. Credit to England. They didn’t lose hope, they kept bowling and getting wickets.”The defeat, India’s third in a row following losses to South Africa and Australia, has left the co-hosts and pre-tournament favourites on the brink of elimination. In all three matches, India had been in winning positions but failed to close out. Against Australia, they couldn’t defend 330, while South Africa chased down 251 despite being seven wickets down.“We are playing good cricket, we are not giving up, but have to cross the line. It’s been the last three games where we showed up with good cricket, but ended up on losing side,” Harmanpreet said. “Our bowlers did a really good job, because when Heather was batting they were looking very good. (We) did a lot right, but last five overs, we have to rethink.”India now face New Zealand in a must-win clash in Navi Mumbai on Thursday, followed by their final group match against Bangladesh on October 26. Victories in both, along with favourable results elsewhere, are crucial to keeping their semi-final hopes alive.“Next game is very important,” the India captain added.","India captain Harmanpreet Kaur described her team's narrow four-run defeat to England as ""heartbreaking"" The defeat, India’s third in a row following losses to South Africa and Australia, has left the co-hosts and pre-tournament favourites on the brink of elimination.

Poll How do you feel about India's chances of qualifying for the semifinals after this loss? Very confident Not confident Completely hopeless

: This was one of the most heart-breaking defeats ever suffered by the Indian women’s cricket team, and it puts their qualification for the semifinals of the 2025 Women’s ODI World Cup in real danger.Riding on fine half-centuries by their senior batters Smriti Mandhana (88, 84b, 8x4), captain Harmanpreet Kaur (70, 70b, 10x4), and Deepti Sharma, who produced a brilliant all-round performance (50, 57b, 5x4 & 4-51 in 10 overs), India looked set to chase down 289, which would have been their highest-ever run chase in ODIs.However, they fell just four runs short on a smoggy night at the Holkar Stadium on Sunday.Pulling off a thrilling win by holding their nerves, England became the third team after Australia and South Africa to qualify for the semifinals. Meanwhile, India, who suffered their third loss in a row, now must beat New Zealand at the DY Patil Stadium in Navi Mumbai on Oct 23 to sneak in as the fourth semifinalists.The star of England’s victory was their former captain Heather Knight, who was removed as the skipper last year after England exited the semifinals of the Women’s T20 World Cup and lost the Ashes to Australia 16-0. Playing in her landmark 300th international match, Knight smashed a splendid century (109 off 91 balls, 15x5, 1x6), which helped her team post a 288 for eight against the hosts.India needed 14 off the last over with all-rounders Amanjot Kaur and Sneh Rana in the middle, but left-arm spinner Linsey Smith, who conceded just 1-40 in 10 overs in a high-scoring game, gave away just nine.Chasing 289 under lights, India suffered two early blows when opener Pratika Rawal (6) was caught behind off Lauren Bell, who returned to action after missing the last match due to illness, in the third over. No. 3 batter Harleen Deol (24 off 31 balls, 5x4) was trapped lbw while trying to play across to off-spinner Charlie Dean. The old firm of Harman and Mandhana put on 125 in 122 balls for the third wicket to raise visions of an easy win, but India kept losing wickets.Trying to cut the ball repeatedly to third man, Harman was caught at short third off England captain Nat Sciver-Brunt in the 31st over. Tiring due to cramps, Mandhana holed out to long off Smith in the 42nd over. Sciver-Brunt then had Richa Ghosh (eight off 10 balls) caught at cover in the 46th over, and suddenly, India, falling behind the required run rate, had no one to force the pace. Once Deepti slogswept Sophie Ecclestone to deep mid-wicket in the 47th over, the game was in England’s hands.Earlier, displaying her amazing prowess at sweeping the spinners, the 34-year-old Knight powered to her third ODI ton and highest-ever score in WODIs. She stitched a 113-run stand off 106 deliveries with skipper Nat Sciver-Brunt (38, 49b, 4x4).’Keeper-bat Amy Jones (56, 68b, 8x4) and Tammy Beaumont (22, 43b, 2x4) provided England with a steady 73-run start in 97 balls. But Deepti dismissed both openers and finished with her best-ever WC figures.After Knight was dismissed run out thanks to brilliant work at deep square leg by Amanjot, India bounced back, taking five wickets for 39 runs.Unfortunately, all that effort ended up being in vain.",England beat India by four runs in ICC Women's World Cup quarter-final in Indore.

Pak-Afghan Border Clash: Airstrike Kills 3 Afghan Cricketers, ACB and Rashid Khan Blast Islamabad

Pakistan has expressed strong criticism towards the International Cricket Council (ICC) for its statement regarding Afghan cricketers' deaths.The ICC and BCCI issued condolence statements on Saturday for the deaths of Afghan cricketers in an aerial attack in Paktika Province, without naming Pakistan. Pakistan's Information Minister Ataullah Tarar rejected these statements, noting Afghanistan's unverified claims about three local cricketers' deaths.The Afghanistan Cricket Board (ACB) withdrew its team from an upcoming tri-series in Pakistan, leading to these statements from cricket governing bodies. Pakistan Cricket Board subsequently announced Zimbabwe as Afghanistan's replacement in the series that includes Sri Lanka.""We dismiss and condemn this statement by the ICC which gives the impression and makes claims that three Afghan cricketers were killed in Pakistan strikes,"" Tarar said in a statement on Sunday.""The ICC has not bothered to independently verify the claims by the Afghanistan board and issued a statement claiming a Pakistan attack,"" he said.Tarar emphasised Pakistan's own experiences as a victim of terrorism and called for the ICC to revise its statement.""It is strange that a few hours after the ICC statement, the Chairman of the ICC Jay Shah repeated the same words on his social media account and the Afghanistan board followed with similar words. The Afghanistan board made statements without presenting any real evidence,"" he added.Several prominent Afghan cricketers, including Rashid Khan and Gulbadin Naib, used social media platforms to strongly condemn the aerial attack and the resulting casualties.""This seriously raises questions on the ICC's independence and unbiased approach. An international sports governing body should not be promoting a controversial claim yet to be verified. The ICC should remain independent and avoid making contentious statements on the incitement of others,"" he said.The minister referenced recent events, including a no-handshake incident during the Asia Cup, suggesting potential bias against Pakistan cricket.The situation has created tension between the cricket boards and raised questions about the verification of claims in international cricket incidents.The PCB's quick action to secure Zimbabwe as a replacement team ensures the tri-series will proceed as planned despite Afghanistan's withdrawal.","ICC and BCCI issued condolence statements on Saturday for the deaths of Afghan cricketers in an aerial attack in Paktika Province, without naming Pakistan.

India captain Shubman Gill reflected on his team's performance after losing the first ODI against Australia in a rain-shortened match by seven wickets.The match saw India lose three crucial wickets during the powerplay overs, including Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli , which significantly impacted their performance.""Never easy, when you lose three wickets in the powerplay, you're always trying to play catch up. There were a lot of learnings and positives as well,"" said Gill after the match.The return of veteran players Kohli and Sharma was brief, lasting only 22 balls combined, as India struggled at 25/3 in the ninth over.Despite the early setbacks, India managed to challenge Australia in defending their total.""Defending 130 in 26 odd overs, we took the game pretty deep so we're satisfied with that,"" added Gill.Gill expressed appreciation for the fans' support during their white-ball tour.""We're very fortunate that wherever we play, fans turn up in huge numbers.

Big thanks to all the crowd that stuck around. I know these days can be really frustrating, but nice to get a win. It's always nice to win at home. I love playing for Australia.""Marsh acknowledged the challenging conditions during the chase.""It (ball) was swinging around a little bit.

New ODI Captain Shubman Gill speaks out on Virat, Rohit and taking Indian cricket forward

Australia needed to chase 131 runs instead of 136 in the Perth ODI after India scored 136/9 in 26 overs following multiple rain interruptions.The match at Perth Stadium featured the return of Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli to international cricket. Rain interrupted play four times, initially reducing the match to 49 overs, then to 35 overs after the second break.Further rain caused officials to reduce the game to 32 overs before finally settling on a 26-over match after the fourth rain delay.KL Rahul scored 38 off 31 balls while Nitish Kumar Reddy remained unbeaten on 19 from 11 deliveries, helping India reach their final total. Rohit Sharma managed only eight runs, and Virat Kohli was dismissed for a duck.Axar Patel contributed 31 runs, while Shubman Gill and Washington Sundar scored 10 runs each. The frequent rain interruptions made it difficult for Indian batters to maintain their momentum.The Duckworth-Lewis-Stern method adjusted Australia's target to 131, considering India had better batting conditions at the start with a dry outfield and longer powerplay.Australia gained an advantage with clear knowledge of their target and the opportunity to plan their innings, barring any further rain interruptions.Mitch Marsh led Australia to a seven-wicket victory with an unbeaten 46 runs. Australia achieved the revised target of 131 with nearly five overs remaining.Marsh built partnerships of 34 runs with Matthew Short, 55 with Josh Philippe, and 32 with Matt Renshaw. Philippe scored 37 runs, while Renshaw remained not out on 21 in his ODI debut.KL Rahul anchored India's innings after early wickets fell. He partnered with Axar Patel for 39 runs and added 31 runs with Sundar before being dismissed.India lost three quick wickets for three runs after Rahul's dismissal. Nitish Reddy's unbeaten 19 runs, including two sixes, helped India reach their final total.India's top order struggled early, losing Rohit Sharma, Shubman Gill, and Virat Kohli for a combined score of 18 runs. This was India's lowest top-three aggregate in men's ODIs since 2019.Josh Hazlewood dismissed Sharma in the fourth over, caught by Renshaw at second slip. Mitchell Starc claimed Kohli's wicket with Cooper Connolly taking a spectacular catch at gully.Nathan Ellis dismissed Gill, who was caught behind down the leg side. Hazlewood then took his second wicket by removing Shreyas Iyer for 11 runs.The series continues with ODIs in Adelaide and Sydney, followed by a five-game T20 series starting October 29.""When you lose three wickets in the powerplay, you're always trying to play a catch-up game. A lot of learnings for us from this game and a lot of positives for us as well. We were defending 130 and we took the game, not till the very end, but pretty deep. We were very satisfied with that. We are very fortunate. The fans turned up in huge numbers and hopefully they'll be able to cheer us on at Adelaide as well,"" said Shubman Gill, India Captain.This marks India's first ODI defeat in 2025, ending their streak of eight consecutive victories.

Madness for Team India in Australia 1,75,000 tickets sold, craze for Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma

Shubman Gill’s first outing as India’s ODI captain ended in a frustrating defeat as Australia cruised to a seven-wicket victory in the series opener in Perth.Gill, following in the footsteps of Virat Kohli, now joins an unwanted record of Indian captains losing their first match in charge across formats.Despite rain interruptions and a truncated 26-over innings, India’s top order faltered early, leaving the new captain with a difficult chase.Australia, winning the toss and electing to field, restricted India to 136 for nine.KL Rahul was the lone bright spot, scoring a quickfire 38 off 31 balls and forging vital partnerships with Axar Patel (31) and Washington Sundar (10) to stabilise the innings after the top three, Rohit Sharma (8), Gill (10), and Virat Kohli (0), collapsed for just 18 runs combined.The trio’s dismal showing marked the lowest aggregate by India’s top three in a men’s ODI since 2019.Nitish Reddy finished the innings with a brisk 19 not out, including two sixes, helping India post a competitive total under the Duckworth-Lewis system.In reply, Australian captain Mitchell Marsh guided his side to a comfortable win, remaining unbeaten on 46 while sharing strong partnerships with Matthew Short (8), Josh Philippe (37), and Matt Renshaw, who scored 21 not out on his ODI debut.The visitors reached the revised target of 131 in just 21.1 overs, nearly five overs to spare, showcasing clinical execution under pressure.Gill, reflecting on the match, acknowledged the learning curve for his new role: “When you lose three wickets in the powerplay, you’re always trying to play a catch-up game. A lot of learning for us from this game, and a lot of positives for us as well. We were defending 130 and we took the game, not till the very end, but pretty deep. We were very satisfied with that.”India’s tour continues with ODIs in Adelaide and Sydney later this week, followed by a five-match T20 series from October 29.While the series opener ended in disappointment, Gill and his team will hope to bounce back quickly against a confident Australian side.","Shubman Gill's first outing as India's ODI captain ended in a frustrating defeat.

'Unfair at this stage!': Virat Kohli's childhood coach on the treatment of senior duo Virat-Rohit

Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma's return to the Indian cricket team was short-lived, lasting only 22 balls, as Australia secured a seven-wicket victory in the rain-affected first ODI on Sunday.India batted first and managed to score 136 for 9 in a match reduced to 26 overs per side due to rain interruptions. Australia was set a DLS-adjusted target of 131, which they achieved in 21.1 overs.Australia's innings began with early setbacks as Travis Head was caught by Harshit Rana off Arshdeep Singh's bowling at deep third man. Matthew Short also departed without making a significant impact.Local captain Mitchell Marsh remained unbeaten on 46 from 52 balls, demonstrating his power-hitting abilities. He formed a crucial 55-run partnership with Josh Philippe, who scored 37 from 29 balls.The Indian pace attack, consisting of Arshdeep, Mohammad Siraj, and Harshit Rana, struggled to maintain control. They provided the Australian batters with numerous scoring opportunities.Marsh capitalized on these opportunities, hitting sixes off all three Indian pacers. His inside-out six over covers off Siraj was particularly impressive.Philippe supported his captain well with an active innings. His dismissal proved to be a minor setback as Australia took a 1-0 lead in the three-match series.India's batting innings was disrupted by frequent weather interruptions and precise Australian bowling. KL Rahul's innings of 38 from 30 balls provided some resistance.The Optus Stadium pitch offered extra bounce, which the Australian bowlers utilized effectively. Rohit Sharma, playing his 500th match for India, opened the innings with captain Shubman Gill but managed only 8 runs from 14 balls.Rohit's innings included one straight drive off Mitchell Starc before Josh Hazlewood's bouncer led to his dismissal, caught by debutant Matthew Renshaw at second slip.Virat Kohli's return was brief as he fell to Starc after facing just eight balls. Cooper Connolly took an excellent catch at backward point, marking Kohli's first duck in Australia.Captain Gill showed promise but fell to Nathan Ellis, caught by wicketkeeper Philippe while attempting a flick. Shreyas Iyer met a similar fate, gliding a Hazlewood bouncer to Philippe, reducing India to 45 for four in the 14th over.India's innings gained momentum through a 39-run partnership between Axar Patel and Rahul. Axar scored 31 before falling to spinner Matthew Kuhnemann.Rahul displayed impressive technique against the bouncing deliveries. His straight drive and pull shot off Ellis were particularly noteworthy.He accelerated against the spinners, hitting Matthew Short for consecutive sixes. Rahul and Washington Sundar put on 30 runs for the sixth wicket.The reduced overs and late wickets prevented India from achieving a competitive total in the final phase of their innings.The Australian bowlers maintained pressure throughout, utilizing the pitch conditions effectively. Their disciplined bowling performance was crucial in restricting India to a below-par total.Australia's successful chase was built on Marsh's steady innings and effective partnerships. The victory gives them an early advantage in the three-match series.The senior Indian players will need to perform better in the upcoming matches at Adelaide and Sydney to maintain their positions in the team.","India batted first and managed to score 136 for 9 in a match reduced to 26 overs per side due to rain interruptions.

Liverpool faced their fourth consecutive defeat, a first in 11 years, as Manchester United secured a 2-1 victory at Anfield on Sunday. Harry Maguire scored the winning goal with a header in the 84th minute, giving United manager Ruben Amorim his first back-to-back Premier League wins.Cody Gakpo had equalised for Liverpool, cancelling out Bryan Mbeumo's early goal that came just 61 seconds into the match.Liverpool now trails Arsenal by four points at the top of the table. Manager Arne Slot continues to seek the right combination after spending £450 million on new players.United moved up to ninth place, now just two points behind Liverpool.

United hadn't won at Anfield since January 2016.Liverpool's current struggles follow a period of transition after rebuilding their title-winning squad. The team was also affected by the tragic loss of Diogo Jota in a July car accident.The match started poorly for Liverpool, who were already dealing with three consecutive losses under Slot.Mbeumo scored the opening goal, getting past Virgil van Dijk and finishing from Amad Diallo's pass.Liverpool protested the goal, arguing that play should have stopped when Alexis MacAllister suffered a head injury from Van Dijk.Slot kept £100 million signing Florian Wirtz on the bench again, trying to balance defensive and attacking needs.Gakpo nearly scored when his shot hit the post from Mohamed Salah's pass, in Liverpool's best first-half move.United missed an opportunity to extend their lead when Bruno Fernandes hit the post from the edge of the area.Liverpool's record signing Alexander Isak almost scored his first Premier League goal, but Senne Lammens made a crucial save.Gakpo was unlucky as his deflected cross hit the post, and he later hit the woodwork again early in the second half.Slot introduced Wirtz and Hugo Ekitike after an hour, joining Salah, Gakpo, and Isak in attack.Salah, despite his scoring record in this fixture, missed a clear chance when he shot wide with only Lammens to beat.Liverpool finally scored when Federico Chiesa, who had just replaced Isak, provided a low cross for Gakpo to convert from close range.United quickly responded as Maguire headed in Fernandes's cross, exposing Liverpool's defensive weaknesses.Gakpo had a late chance to equalize but headed wide from Jeremie Frimpong's cross.The defeat ended Liverpool's year-long unbeaten league run at Anfield, damaging their hopes of winning a record 21st English top-flight title.","Manchester United beat Liverpool 2-1 at Anfield on Sunday.

There weren't too many chances. I think overall it could've gone either way,"" Frank said.""I think 1-1 would've been a fair result. Villa scored two goals from outside the box in moments where you wouldn't expect them to score.Fair play for their moments of quality.

Substitute Ronald Araújo snatched Barcelona a 2-1 victory over Girona in stoppage time in La Liga on Saturday and ended a mini losing streak before the clasico at Real Madrid next week.The central defender made the move of a striker when he slid in front of his marker as they raced to the near post and skilfully redirected a low pass from Frenkie de Jong and ignited the home crowd.Araújo's last-gasp goal came moments after Barcelona coach Hansi Flick was sent off with two quick yellow cards apparently for complaining that the referee had not added more than four minutes of injury time.The sending off means Flick won't be on the sideline for the first clasico of the season.Before the international break, Barcelona lost to Paris Saint-Germain 2-1 in the Champions League and was stunned at Sevilla 4-1 in La Liga.Pedri González gave Barcelona the lead with an exquisite goal in the 13th, sliding an angled ball back across the area and inside the near post without looking at the target.But Barcelona's control collapsed after Axel Witsel equalized seven minutes later with an acrobatic bicycle kick to whip a loose high ball off the turf and past Wojciech Szczesny.Only Szczesny's saves and some poor marksmanship by Girona kept the visitors from taking the lead before halftime after it was able to mount repeated counterattacks after Barcelona lost possession.Girona then needed goalie Paulo Gazzaniga to turn back shots by Fermín López and Marcus Rashord before Araújo´s clinched the result.With Barcelona missing strikers Robert Lewandowski and Ferran Torres and playmaker Dani Olmo to injury, Flick gave a La Liga debut to 17-year-old forward Toni Fernández.

India's men's senior national football team has dropped to 136th place in the latest FIFA World Rankings, marking their lowest position since November 2016.The team's new ranking coincides with their elimination from both the 2026 FIFA World Cup and the 2027 AFC Asian Cup qualifications.India's football journey has seen significant changes in recent times. After achieving success in the 2023 Intercontinental Cup, SAFF Championship, and Tri-Nation Series, the team's performance has declined considerably.Their promising period, which had helped them reach the top 100 rankings, was followed by a disappointing AFC Asian Cup campaign in Qatar. The team failed to score any goals and suffered three consecutive defeats in the group stage.The national team's leadership has undergone multiple changes, with three different head coaches in less than two years. Igor Štimac was replaced by Manolo Márquez, who was later succeeded by Khalid Jamil.Under Jamil's leadership, the team showed some tactical improvements during the CAFA Nations Cup friendly tournament. However, their competitive match results have remained unsatisfactory.The team's most recent competitive victory was against Kuwait in November 2023, with a score of 1-0.In the global rankings, Spain maintains its position at the top, followed by Argentina and France in second and third places respectively. The top eight positions are completed by England, Portugal, the Netherlands, Brazil, and Belgium.Germany has moved up two positions to 10th place after winning their qualifying matches against Luxembourg and Northern Ireland. Croatia has moved down to 11th position following their draw with the Czech Republic.The rankings will play a crucial role in determining the seedings for the expanded 48-team 2026 World Cup draw scheduled for December 5.

British officials are under mounting pressure to reverse a decision that prevents Maccabi Tel Aviv supporters from attending a European match at Aston Villa. The Israeli government has criticised this ban.Aston Villa announced that following police guidance, away fans would not be permitted at the UEFA Europa League match against the Israeli club in Birmingham on November 6 due to security concerns.""Shameful decision! I call on the UK authorities to reverse this coward decision,"" posted Israel's foreign minister Gideon Saar on X.UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer opposed the decision. He expressed his views on social media platform X.""We will not tolerate antisemitism on our streets.

Juergen Klinsmann enjoys a rare distinction of being part of Der Klassiker both as a player and a coach. He is one of the four managers to have played for Bayern Munich and coached the Bavarian elites. Croatian Niko Kovac, the current Borussia Dortmund coach plotting to disrupt Bayern Munich’s all-win record this season on Saturday, is also part of the unique club.Talking to TOI on Wednesday, an excited Klinsmann expressed his thoughts on the upcoming fixture, considered to be the biggest draw in the Bundesliga. With Dortmund’s Serhou Guirassy cleared to play, the German goal-scoring legend feels that his eyes will sway between the Guinean striker and Bayern’s in-form Harry Kane “Well, I think these are the games that, as a striker, you wait for the whole year. You badly want to score in these matchups. So, obviously it doesn’t need extra motivation for any of the players when these two teams clash because it’s a big deal in Germany and for all the Bundesliga fans around the world.”Klinsmann obviously loves talking about strikers. “Kane, Guirassy, (Michael) Olise, (Karim) Adeyemi, all, I’m sure, wait for such evenings.Days before, you kind of think through it and you wish you want to score. Immediately television and social media will showcase the moment around the world and that’s pretty cool.”Scoring seems to come as naturally as breathing for Harry Kane, the English captain in Bayern’s forward lineup. He has already scored 21 goals for club and country. Guirassy, too, has 10 to his credit across all competitions.“I think games like that, you want to have somebody to stand out. You want to have somebody to put the stamp on the match. And when you have players of this calibre, then all us football fans want to wait for these moments. We want to see them kind of prove a point,” said the German goal-scoring legend.Klinsmann couldn’t help referring to his playing days but not in a glorifying nostalgic way. Accepting the evolution of the game, he said, “The video analysts and the coaching staff dissect your game so thoroughly that they know where the weaknesses of the opponents are, how to break them down. During my days, things weren’t that sophisticated. We were not so deeply prepared by video analysts about the opponents.”(Watch Bundesliga 2025-26 Bayern Munich vs. Borussia Dortmund on 18th October 2025 from 10 PM IST live on Sony Sports Ten 2 SD & HD.)","Juergen Klinsmann is one of the four managers to have played for Bayern Munich and coached the Bavarian elites.

Poll Should XL bully dogs be banned in all countries? Yes, for public safety. No, responsible ownership is key. Maybe, with stricter regulations.

Algeria international and Saudi Pro League winger Said Benrahma has been fined £12,000 (Rs 14 lakh) for owning dangerously out-of-control dogs that attacked a golden retriever in 2023 while he was playing for West Ham.Benrahma admitted to two counts of owning dangerously out-of-control dogs during a court hearing via video link from Saudi Arabia, where he currently plays for Neom.The incident took place in east London when his two XL bullies escaped from his home and attacked a golden retriever named Bailey, injuring the dog and a man.The retriever required veterinary treatment, while its owner sustained grazes to the arms and legs.Benrahma defended himself by saying the dogs escaped through a side gate left open by someone working for him at the time. The dogs now live in France.District Judge Matt Jabbitt imposed fines of £5,000 for each attack and ordered Benrahma to pay £2,500 compensation to Bailey’s owner, plus £495 in kennel costs.The judge noted that Benrahma “expressed remorse when interviewed” and also remarked that it was his first time “sentencing someone in the Middle East.”The case took place months before the British government introduced a ban on owning XL bully dogs in England and Wales following a series of fatal attacks.Under the current law, it is a criminal offense to own such dogs without a certificate of exemption.Despite Benrahma's defense, the magistrate emphasized the severity of the attacks, which left both an animal and a person injured.The winger’s case has drawn attention not only because of his footballing profile but also due to the growing public scrutiny around XL bully dogs and the potential dangers posed when such animals are left unsupervised.","Said Benrahma has been fined £12,000 (around USD 16,000) for owning dangerously out-of-control dogs that attacked a golden retriever in 2023 while he was playing for West Ham.

Nick Sirianni’s wild postgame reaction after Eagles beat Vikings goes viral



Vikings fall short despite red zone chances



The Philadelphia Eagles finally found their rhythm again. After two frustrating losses that raised questions about their dominance, head coach Nick Sirianni’s team delivered a much-needed 28-22 win over the Minnesota Vikings at U.S. Bank Stadium. It wasn’t perfect, but it was a statement — one filled with grit, resilience, and a touch of raw emotion from the fiery coach himself.Quarterback Jalen Hurts was the heartbeat of this victory. He looked composed, confident, and in complete control — a far cry from the struggles of recent weeks. Hurts completed 19 of 23 passes for 326 yards and threw three touchdowns, lighting up the Vikings’ secondary whenever momentum seemed to shift. Every time Minnesota closed in, Hurts answered with a precise strike that reminded fans why he’s one of the NFL ’s top playmakers.His connection with DeVonta Smith was electric. Smith hauled in nine catches for 183 yards, including a spectacular touchdown that silenced the crowd. The chemistry between the duo gave the offense a spark that had been missing since the team’s hot 4-0 start.While the stat sheet tells one story, the emotional lift this game provided tells another. As Sirianni entered the locker room postgame, music thumping through the walls, he couldn’t hold back his emotions.With a grin of sheer relief, he shouted, “Turn that s* up!”** — a fitting release after a turbulent stretch.For the Vikings, the game was a story of missed opportunities. Returning from their bye week after back-to-back European matchups, they moved the ball efficiently but couldn’t finish drives. Minnesota reached the red zone six times but managed just one touchdown — a one-yard plunge by Jordan Mason in the third quarter.The rest of their trips ended with five field goals from Will Reichard, a statistic that ultimately decided the game. The Eagles’ defense, anchored by second-year corner Cooper DeJean, bent but never broke. DeJean made eight tackles and delivered a crucial deflection on a near-touchdown pass to Justin Jefferson that could’ve flipped the game.The Eagles’ win wasn’t just about numbers. It was about responding to adversity. And with Sirianni’s fiery energy and Hurts’ poise leading the way, Philadelphia reminded everyone they’re still built to defend their crown.Also Read: Michael Penix Jr.’s Net Worth 2025: All about his contract, salary and more","The Philadelphia Eagles beat the Minnesota Vikings 28-22.

Madison Beer’s sweet selfie moment wins the internet

Chargers fall short, but Herbert and Beer keep fans buzzing

A casual game-day selfie turned into an internet sensation when a Colts fan’s playful post featuring popstar Madison Beer went viral during the Los Angeles Chargers’ Week 7 game at SoFi Stadium. Beer, who is dating Chargers quarterback Justin Herbert , stole the spotlight effortlessly, proving that even off the stage, she knows how to command attention.It all began when a Colts fan named Erik shared a fun selfie on Instagram, smiling beside Madison Beer before kickoff. “Hi, Madison bestie! Thank you so much, but unfortunately, it’s Colts today,” he captioned with hashtags like “#Colts,” “#Chargers,” “#NFL,” and “#Football.” The post quickly caught fire online, with fans loving the wholesome moment.Interestingly, about an hour before the photo surfaced, Beer had teased a behind-the-scenes snap from a video shoot, adding to her already buzzing weekend presence. She’s been riding high after her show-stealing performance at the Victoria’s Secret Fashion Show, where her stunning all-black look and live performance earned her praise from across the industry.Justin Herbert, ever the supportive boyfriend, was seen liking several of her posts from the event. Fans couldn’t help but note how the Pro Bowler and former NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year is “one lucky man.” His laid-back California vibe complements Beer’s confident, glam persona, making them one of the most talked-about couples in both sports and entertainment.While the Chargers fell 38-24 to the Indianapolis Colts, the couple still managed to dominate social media chatter. Jonathan Taylor powered the Colts to victory with three touchdowns, while Herbert threw two scoring passes to keep Los Angeles in the fight.Even with a banged-up offensive line, Herbert played with the same composure that has defined his career. Meanwhile, Madison Beer’s rising fame continues to blur the line between sports and pop culture, showing that when she’s in the stands, all eyes somehow drift her way.The selfie may have been just for fun—but it perfectly captured a crossover moment between NFL fandom and Hollywood stardom that everyone couldn’t stop talking about.Also Read: Jayden Daniels exits early with hamstring injury — could this be a major setback for the Commanders’ season?","A Colts fan's playful post featuring popstar Madison Beer went viral during the Los Angeles Chargers’ Week 7 game at SoFi Stadium.

Michael Penix Jr.’s net worth, contract details



Michael Penix Jr.’s endorsements and philanthropy



When the Atlanta Falcons selected Michael Penix Jr. with the No. 8 pick in the 2024 NFL Draft, it marked the beginning of a new era in Atlanta. The Washington standout, who led the Huskies to a 14-1 season and a national championship appearance, now carries the hopes of a franchise eager for a fresh start. With his poise, precision, and leadership, Penix has already become one of the most intriguing young quarterbacks to watch in 2025.Penix’s first NFL deal speaks volumes about the Falcons’ belief in his potential. He signed a four-year, $22.88 million contract that’s fully guaranteed, including a $13.5 million signing bonus. For the 2025 season, his cap hit stands at just over $5.2 million. The deal also comes with a fifth-year team option, giving Atlanta flexibility as he develops into a long-term starter.But Penix’s financial success extends far beyond the gridiron. His estimated net worth of $1.2 million, per Pro Football Network, is the result of not only his NFL contract but also his lucrative NIL and endorsement deals. Before even taking a professional snap, he had already built a diverse portfolio featuring Simply Seattle, Husky Throwbacks, and Montlake Futures. His collaboration with Simply Seattle includes a personal line of merchandise — a T-shirt selling for $24.99, with half of the profits going directly to him.Now aligned with Adidas, Penix continues to strengthen his brand. “Through every up and down, the Three Stripes have remained consistent,” he said. “It’s only right that [the two] continue it together.” That enduring relationship underscores how deeply he values loyalty and legacy in his career.Beyond his deal with Adidas, Penix has partnerships with Beats by Dre, Panini, and Sharpie, positioning him as one of the NFL’s most marketable young athletes. Yet what truly sets him apart is his commitment to giving back.At the University of Washington, he volunteered with Mary’s Place, a Seattle nonprofit supporting homeless families. His compassion continued into the NFL, where he represented the Boys & Girls Club through Sharpie during the “My Cause, My Cleats” campaign. “I want to be that positive example, that role model they can look up to,” Penix said.With his combination of talent, humility, and heart, Michael Penix Jr. is proving that his rise in the NFL is just getting started.Also Read: Jacoby Brissett’s strong effort couldn’t save the Cardinals as Packers hand them another painful loss","The Atlanta Falcons selected Michael Penix Jr. with the No. 8 pick in the 2024 NFL Draft.

Could Micah Parsons face possible NFL punishment after controversial hip-drop tackle during Packers win?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/could-micah-parsons-face-possible-nfl-punishment-after-controversial-hip-drop-tackle-during-packers-win/articleshow/124697372.cms,"Green Bay Packers star Micah Parsons faces potential NFL scrutiny after a controversial hip-drop tackle penalty nullified a sack against the Cardinals. This incident fuels ongoing debate about the league's new player safety rules and their inconsistent enforcement, with Parsons himself having voiced frustration over officiating. A fine is a possibility, mirroring penalties issued to other players for similar infractions.

Frustration builds as Micah Parsons calls out officiating inconsistencies

Potential fine looms as debate grows around new rule

Green Bay Packers star pass rusher Micah Parsons could soon be under the NFL ’s microscope following a controversial penalty in Sunday’s victory over the Arizona Cardinals. The defensive end, who’s been candid about his frustrations with officiating this season, was flagged for a hip-drop tackle on quarterback Jacoby Brissett, wiping out what would have been his second sack of the game.Micah Parsons has been one of the league’s most outspoken defenders this season, particularly when it comes to what he perceives as a lack of fair officiating. He told reporters last week that he’s grown tired of being on the wrong end of missed holding calls.“It’s just one of them things,” Parsons said via Sports Illustrated’s Bill Huber. “Five years of not getting a call, you eventually stop worrying about it. I think I just got to keep going. That’s the hunt, yeah. That’s part of the challenge is you just got to keep going. And that’s bothersome. That worries them. They know that.”The flag on Sunday not only nullified his sack but also gave Arizona a first down, helping them trim Green Bay’s lead with a field goal. The play reignited debate around the NFL’s new “hip-drop tackle” rule, which aims to reduce leg and ankle injuries but has drawn criticism for being difficult to enforce consistently.According to Pro Football Talk, the league fined Jets defensive lineman Quinnen Williams $17,389 for a similar hit earlier this season. If reviewed, Parsons could face a comparable penalty. This wouldn’t be his first, in 2022, he was fined $10,609 for flexing over Eagles tight end Dallas Goedert after a sack.Many analysts questioned the call against Parsons, arguing that defenders are being asked to make impossible adjustments mid-tackle. “With that being said, how else is Micah Parsons supposed to make that tackle?” wrote 247 Sports’ Zach Jacobson, echoing the sentiments of several beat reporters.Whether the NFL decides to issue a fine or not, one thing is clear: Parsons’ growing frustration reflects a deeper tension between defensive players and the league’s evolving player safety rules — a balance that remains far from settled.Also Read: Jayden Daniels exits early with hamstring injury — could this be a major setback for the Commanders’ season?","Green Bay Packers star Micah Parsons was flagged for a hip-drop tackle on quarterback Jacoby Brissett.

Jacoby Brissett shines but can’t overcome Arizona’s offensive line struggles



Fourth-quarter collapse seals another tough loss for the Cardinals



Jacoby Brissett gave everything he had as the Arizona Cardinals battled the Green Bay Packers, but his determined performance couldn’t prevent yet another close defeat. Playing without several key starters and surrounded by a crowd dominated by cheeseheads, Brissett carried the offense with confidence and grit. Still, despite his strong showing, Arizona’s 27-23 loss extended their slump to 2-5 heading into the bye week, leaving fans frustrated and searching for answers.Brissett played with poise and precision, completing 25 of 36 passes for 279 yards and two touchdowns. His leadership was evident, his accuracy sharp, and his resilience unwavering. Yet, even a composed performance like his couldn’t hide Arizona’s glaring protection problems. The offensive line was overwhelmed, giving up six sacks — three of them to the relentless Micah Parsons. Every dropback seemed like a gamble, but Brissett stood tall and kept the Cardinals within reach until the very end.Tight end Trey McBride turned in the best performance of his young career, hauling in two touchdowns and setting a new season high for receiving yards. His chemistry with Brissett gave Arizona hope, especially when they built a 20-13 lead heading into the final quarter.For a brief moment, it felt like the Cardinals might finally snap their losing streak.But familiar issues resurfaced when it mattered most. The defense couldn’t contain the Packers’ late push, allowing two unanswered touchdowns, including Josh Jacobs’ one-yard plunge with less than two minutes left. Still, Brissett refused to fold. He drove the offense down to Green Bay’s 27-yard line in a desperate final effort, but his fourth-down pass was tipped in the end zone — ending yet another heartbreaking finish.Now 2-5 entering the bye week, the Cardinals face tough questions about protection, consistency, and how to turn Brissett’s individual effort into team success. The veteran quarterback proved again he can compete under pressure. What Arizona needs next is a way to protect him — and to finally finish what they start.Also Read: Jayden Daniels exits early with hamstring injury — could this be a major setback for the Commanders’ season?","The Arizona Cardinals lost 27-23 to the Green Bay Packers on Sunday.

Jayden Daniels injury update



What Jayden Daniels’ injury means for the Commanders



Washington Commanders quarterback Jayden Daniels suffered a right hamstring injury during Sunday’s matchup against the Dallas Cowboys, adding to an already injury-riddled season for the team. The injury occurred early in the third quarter and forced Daniels out of the game, leaving Washington scrambling for stability at the quarterback position once again.The injury took place with 11:53 left in the third quarter when Dallas linebacker Shemar James broke through Washington’s offensive line on a first-and-10 play. Daniels initially looked ready to throw but decided to tuck the ball under pressure. As James made contact, Daniels lost control of the ball and went down awkwardly. He immediately grabbed the back of his right leg, a clear indication of a hamstring issue.Medical staff attended to him on the field before escorting him to the locker room for further evaluation. Shortly after, the Commanders officially ruled him out for the rest of the game. Before exiting, Daniels completed 12 of 22 passes for 156 yards and a touchdown, while also adding 35 rushing yards and another score — showcasing once again the dual-threat ability that has made him one of the most exciting young quarterbacks in the league.Daniels’ absence was immediately felt. Backup quarterback Marcus Mariota stepped in but struggled to find rhythm, throwing a pick-six on his first drive that widened Dallas’s lead to 41-15. Cowboys won the game by 44-22.The Commanders’ offense has been decimated by injuries this season. Key playmakers Terry McLaurin, Deebo Samuel, and Noah Brown were already sidelined, while star running back Austin Ekeler was lost for the year in Week 2 with an Achilles tear. Because of these setbacks, Washington’s projected starting lineup hasn’t taken the field together since training camp.Daniels’ potential absence looms large. The rookie already missed two games earlier this year with a sprained left knee, and the Commanders can ill afford another prolonged loss. In his five appearances, Daniels has completed 61% of his passes for 1,031 yards, eight touchdowns, and just one interception — numbers that underscore his growth and promise.With the Kansas City Chiefs up next on October 27, all eyes will be on Daniels’ recovery timeline. The Commanders will hope their young quarterback can heal quickly, but for now, veteran Marcus Mariota will have to lead an offense fighting to stay afloat.Also Read: From concerts to kickoffs: Ed Kelce shows just how close he’s grown to Taylor Swift","Washington Commanders quarterback Jayden Daniels suffered a right hamstring injury during Sunday's game against the Dallas Cowboys.

Technical chaos continues to plague FOX after Mark Sanchez ’s departure

Fans roast FOX for turning modern NFL coverage into a ‘radio broadcast from the 1940s’

When the New York Jets hosted the Carolina Panthers in Week 7, viewers expected a regular Sunday broadcast but FOX Sports delivered something else entirely. What was supposed to be a routine telecast quickly turned into a soundscape from another era, leaving fans wondering if they had accidentally tuned into a 1940s radio show instead of a 2025 NFL game.FOX’s broadcast troubles didn’t begin this week. Following Mark Sanchez’s controversial exit from the network earlier this season, FOX scrambled to reorganize its commentator lineup. Veteran duo Mark Schlereth and Chris Myers have since been filling in, but the problems go well beyond who’s in the booth.For the second week in a row, audio malfunctions disrupted live coverage with muffled commentary, glitchy sound, and what fans described as “tin can” audio. During the previous week’s Jacksonville-Seattle matchup, viewers heard one frustrated broadcaster admit, “I can’t hear the producer,” as production chaos unfolded midgame. It appears little has improved since then.Even insiders are baffled. As Seattle-based journalist Mookie Alexander put it, “this was a pretty big game and the production values were a step above public access… The audio cut out, the video froze, it was just terrible to watch.”NFL fans didn’t hold back online. “Why does the audio on the Panthers Jets game sound like it’s from the Great Depression?” one viewer asked on X, while another added, “We doing a Tin Can broadcast for the Panthers vs Jets game today, Fox? Audio sounds like it’s straight from the 60s.”Others leaned into the humor, joking that the distorted audio gave the game a “70s feel”, though most agreed it made the experience unwatchable.While some brushed it off as nostalgia, the overall sentiment was clear: fans expect better from a network as established as FOX. Technical issues might be common in broadcasting, but recurring malfunctions during consecutive NFL weekends have sparked a bigger conversation, about whether the network’s infrastructure is falling behind in an era where even small streaming platforms deliver flawless live coverage.Also Read: Is Mark Sanchez broadcasting any NFL games this weekend?

Kansas City Chiefs fans attending Sunday’s matchup against the Las Vegas Raiders were treated to more than just football. Ed Kelce, the beloved father of Chiefs star Travis Kelce , was spotted outside Arrowhead Stadium handing out handmade friendship bracelets, a touching nod to Taylor Swift ’s fandom and her connection with the Kelce family.Chiefs season ticket holders Brianne Kobe and Decemeber Brammer were among the lucky fans who received the bracelets from the 73-year-old Kelce patriarch. “We are season ticket members of the Chiefs and have been for 14 years. We’ve loved having the Kelce family in Kansas City, and welcome Taylor with open arms,” Brammer told PEOPLE. She described the moment as unexpectedly sweet, saying, “He was so sweet and greeting everyone and [was] the cutest passing them out!”The bracelets Ed handed out were no ordinary souvenirs, they were intricately beaded with “Travis” and “Taylor” connected by a single heart bead and marked with an “E” for Ed. For many fans, it symbolized the merging of two worlds: the NFL and the Swiftie universe. Friendship bracelets have become a cornerstone of Taylor Swift’s Eras Tour culture, inspired by the lyric “make the friendship bracelets” from her song You’re On Your Own, Kid.Swift herself has spoken fondly about the fan tradition, telling a New Orleans crowd in 2024, “You’ve created traditions. You’ve created this mass movement of joy every time we play a show.And it makes me so proud, it really does.”This isn’t the first time Ed Kelce has joined in on the bracelet fun, he previously handed out similar tokens at Swift’s Toronto concert in 2024, following in the footsteps of Taylor’s dad, Scott Swift, who has also become a fan favorite for doing the same.Now with Taylor and Travis engaged, their families have become symbols of mutual respect and warmth, blending pop culture and sports in a way few relationships have. As one fan put it after meeting Ed, “It’s moments like these that remind us why the Kelces are so loved, they make everyone feel like part of their story.”Also Read: “Directly shading taylor”: Olivia Rodrigo sparks fresh feud rumors with Taylor Swift as Travis Kelce’s ex Kayla Nicole get dragged into the mix","Ed Kelce handed out friendship bracelets to Chiefs fans outside Arrowhead Stadium.

Augustas Marčiulionis: Following in His Father’s Footsteps

What is in Store for the Los Angeles Lakers

The Los Angeles Lakers are trimming down their roster ahead of the 2025-26 NBA season, officially parting ways with four training camp players - a move that signals the team’s final adjustments before opening night.According to a team announcement shared via X on Saturday, the Lakers have waived RJ Davis, Augustas Marčiulionis, Anton Watson, and Nate Williams. “The Los Angeles Lakers have waived RJ Davis, Augustas Marčiulionis, Anton Watson and Nate Williams,” the team shared via X on Saturday afternoon.The Los Angeles Lakers are gearing up for what could be one of their most pivotal campaigns in recent memory. With Luka Dončić entering his first full season as the team’s lead star and LeBron James sidelined for a few weeks due to sciatica, roster depth has become an early concern.However, with the NBA’s 15-player roster limit, the front office had to make some tough calls before the season begins.Among the four cuts, RJ Davis was the most notable name. A product of the University of North Carolina, Davis played 175 games from 2020 to 2025, averaging 15.6 points and 3.8 assists while shooting 36.7% from three-point range on 5.6 attempts per game.The 6-foot scoring guard built a strong collegiate reputation for his offensive consistency and leadership, helping the Tar Heels maintain national relevance during his five seasons.Though he couldn’t secure a spot on the Los Angeles Lakers’ final roster, the 23-year-old’s talent suggests he could find an opportunity in the G-League or possibly with another NBA team seeking backcourt depth.Another notable name among the waived players is Augustas Marčiulionis, son of Šarūnas Marčiulionis, the 1992 NBA Sixth Man of the Year runner-up and a key figure in Lithuanian basketball history.After a steady four-year career at St. Mary’s College of California, the 6-foot-4 guard earned a chance to compete for a Lakers roster spot. Unfortunately, he struggled to make a noticeable impact in preseason action and did not see significant playing time under head coach JJ Redick.Despite this setback, Augustas’ pedigree and experience make him an intriguing developmental prospect for teams across Europe or the G-League.The Los Angeles Lakers’ decision to waive these players underlines their focus on roster stability and depth as they aim to compete for a championship with a retooled lineup centered around Dončić.With LeBron James temporarily sidelined, Anthony Davis expected to anchor the defense, and several new faces added during the offseason, Los Angeles is prioritizing experienced contributors over developmental prospects - at least for now.Also read: NBA trade news: Golden State Warriors waive NCAA Champion Guard ahead of 2025-26 season - wise move or hasty mishap?

A Tough Break for a Promising Prospect

Thehave made another roster adjustment just before the start of the 2025-26 NBA season. Following the news of Seth Curry’s release, the team has officially parted ways with 24-year-old guard, ending his short preseason run with the franchise.On Saturday afternoon, the Golden State Warriors confirmed their latest roster cuts. “The Golden State Warriors have waived guards LJ Cryer and Seth Curry,” the Dubs stated in their most recent news release.Cryer joined the Golden State Warriors on September 29 after going undrafted in the 2025 NBA Draft. Despite showing flashes of potential during preseason, the 6-foot guard didn’t secure a spot on the team’s final roster.LJ Cryer appeared in five preseason games for Golden State, contributing solid minutes off the bench. His averages reflected promise and efficiency in limited action.One of his most notable showings came during the Golden State Warriors’ comeback win over the Portland Trail Blazers , where he scored 14 points while shooting an impressive 80% from the field and a perfect 100% from three-point range.Before entering the NBA, LJ Cryer made a name for himself as a lethal shooter at the collegiate level. A native of New Orleans, Louisiana, he first gained attention as part of Baylor University’s 2021 NCAA Championship-winning roster.While Cryer wasn’t a primary scoring option as a freshman, his development over the following seasons turned him into one of college basketball’s most efficient guards.His shooting prowess and composure under pressure helped him catch the Golden State Warriors’ eye, ultimately earning him a training camp deal following the NBA 2K26 Summer League.Despite a solid effort in camp and preseason, Golden State ultimately decided that Cryer wasn’t ready for an opening-night roster spot. The move leaves him searching for a new opportunity elsewhere in the league or overseas. Cryer appeared in five preseason games with Golden State, averaging 5.0 points, 1.8 assists, and 1.6 rebounds in 9.6 minutes per game.”LJ Cryer’s next step remains uncertain, but his shooting ability and experience as an NCAA champion could make him an attractive option for teams looking to add depth and scoring punch to their backcourt rotations.Also read: NBA Trade News: Indiana Pacers Sign #14 Overall 2015 Draft Pick to Bolster Squad Around Tyrese and Pascal for 2025-26 Season The Golden State Warriors’ decision underscores how competitive roster spots have become, particularly for undrafted rookies like Cryer.

Nikola Jokic’s bond with his majestic horses reveals a different side of the NBA star

What did Draymond Green say about Nikola Jokic?

Nikola Jokić, the Denver Nuggets ' star player, is a horse enthusiast. He is a horse owner at a harness racing competition in his homeland of Serbia. Everybody who is a Nuggets fan is aware that Jokic spends every summer season of the NBA living his typical Serbian style, which includes a lot of horse racing and rafting tours. In Serbia, Jokic also has a horse stable of a few horses which participate in a number of different races. Nikola Jokic is a winner at the racecourse this summer. After reaping the success of his horse at a race in Serbia, the Denver Nuggets' star celebrated in a very emotional manner. Cameras caught him crying on the sidelines when his horse reached the finish line. He then jumped over the gate in celebration to welcome the rider and his horse.After helping his rider stand up, Jokic poured the champagne on everyone, including the horse, before pouring it over himself. Additionally, in the Sombor suburbs of Serbia, his father Branislav owns a local harness racing club.Additionally, he also got emotional over his horse multiple times. He was overcome with emotion when his horse, Demon Dell’Est, won the annual Dužijanac event in Subotica in the closing moments.He sobbed as he soaked up the moment.After his horse won the race and received about $450 in prize money, Jokic became emotional again. Following the Nuggets' victory in the 2023 NBA championship, Branislav Jokic informed the Associated Press that his son had always been interested in horses, even though he had worked tirelessly to reach the NBA. He further said:“He started growing, both in height and in size, and he started to become aware that he could be a basketball player, but he had a great desire in those days. He would say, ‘Dad, I want to become a horseman.’ And I used to tell him: ‘Son, become a basketball player first, and you’ll become a great horseman later.’”Meanwhile Nikola's celebration after the victory evoked memories of his on-court interview after winning the 2023 NBA Finals and declaring, ""The job is done. We are now free to return home."" When questioned about the impending title parade during the subsequent press conference, he said:""No. I must return home. He explained that his remarks were made because the parade on Thursday would be too near to his Sunday horse racing…”He has always had a deep affection for horses. When his family took him to racing day in his hometown, he fell in love with them. He even traveled back to his horse stable in Serbia to receive his 2022 MVP award.Furthermore, his teammate Aaron Gordon also traveled with him to Serbia during the 2023 offseason to watch a horse race. American horse jockey Tim Tetrick also said that Jokic was keen on horse racing and that the three-time MVP would reportedly become a horse trainer after retirement. Draymond Green had recently revealed the most challenging defense he has ever come across. During Kai Cenat's live stream, he voiced some concern regarding a particular player in relation to the players of this era. He acknowledged that he still causes a lot of trouble for the majority of the guys. Then he stated:“The hardest now is Joker [Nikola Jokic]. I play with Steph, so I don’t have that headache … Luka [Doncic] will always be one of the toughest, but that ain’t my matchup. The hardest to guard right now is Joker.”He further said that Jovic's height and intelligence reportedly make it difficult for players to guard him. He was able to score whenever he wanted and distribute the ball in ways that others couldn't. Green then praised Jokic for being the most difficult player in the game to protect.Also read: What is Nikola Jokic's net worth?

NBA legend makes strong prediction about Nikola Jokic’s mindset ahead of the new season

With an impressive career of more than a decade, one of Denver Nuggets ' biggest stars Nikola Jokic has left his mark on the NBA. Even though he is from the small Serbian town of Sombor, he made it to Denver in 2015. He was born in war-torn Serbia. Jokic shared a two-bedroom apartment with his mother, father, grandmother, and two brothers. He once said during an interview that his brothers pushed him towards greatness. Nikola Jokic has a Serbian heritage. Jokic does not hesitate to show his affection for his parents, despite spending the majority of his time in Denver with his wife and daughter. He said during one interview:""I'm homesick. I want to go home right now. I mean, I am the third kid, and I am a little closer with my parents than [my brothers] are. After my career is over… I'm gonna go back there. It's super slow—not too much going on—but you have everything… How I say, no place like home? Something like that.""While living in Serbia , they shared a small flat with two bedrooms. There, Jokic would play basketball with his siblings while a tiny toy hoop hung on the door. He was four years old in 1999, when the war in Serbia was going on. In an interview with Bleachers Report, he revealed:""I remember things like sirens, bomb shelters, always turning off the lights.We practically lived in the dark. Even at like 9 a.m., everything was turned off.""However, he only had positive memories of the place once the war was over. During an interview with SLAM Magazine, he stated:""It's a really small town in the northwest of Serbia. We have nice nature. But I just like the people there. It's like a family. I actually like Denver as a city — it reminds me a little of my hometown in Serbia because I like nature, mountains, rivers and trees.""Nikola also mentioned his desire to go back to Serbia in an interview with Bleacher Report. He revealed:""After my career is over, I'm gonna go back there. It's super slow — not too much going on — but you have everything. You have a canal, nature; you can get peace of mind outside the city. I just like to be some place where I know how to drive a car without navigation…""Jokic has always dedicated his success as a basketball player to his family's support and encouragement, particularly from his brothers.As the regular season approaches, two-time NBA MVP and current Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame member Steve Nash recently talked about Jokic. He said that Jokic playing ""with a bit of a chip on his shoulder"" in the upcoming season is something he would not mind.Furthermore, he also predicted that Jokic will finish his career in the top three or four statistical players in the league.

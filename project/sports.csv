Greenstone Lobo predicts winner of IND vs ENG series | Who Has the Astrological Edge?

Continuing his remarkable record in challenging SENA (South Africa, England, New Zealand, Australia) conditions, Rahul crafted his third Test hundred on English soil — and sixth overall in SENA — to put India firmly in control of the opening Test. His 195-run partnership with Rishabh Pant pushed India’s second innings lead to 370, setting England a daunting 371-run target.Reflecting on his form after the day’s play, Rahul toldthat he no longer obsesses over numbers or milestones. “I am just getting runs now. There was a time when I would get starts but not convert them into big scores, especially in Tests. I am much calmer in my head and not chasing numbers anymore. I just want to enjoy my cricket as much as I can,” he said.He also credited former India assistant coach Abhishek Nayar for playing a key role in reviving his approach. “I have spent a lot of time with him in the last 15-18 months. I went back to basics. Earlier, I focused too much on quality over quantity and did not spend enough time hitting balls. Now, I enjoy spending long hours in the nets,” Rahul added.Rahul’s purple patch extends across formats. He starred as India’s dependable No.5 during the 2023 ODI World Cup, amassing 452 runs, including India’s fastest World Cup ton — a 62-ball century against the Netherlands.Post-World Cup, he embraced the finisher’s role, delivering crucial runs during India’s ICC Champions Trophy triumph, where he averaged a staggering 140 in four innings.In the IPL too, Rahul rediscovered his aggressive best, scoring 539 runs at a strike rate of nearly 150, his best since 2018 while opening and batting in the top order for Delhi Capitals.After a stint as a middle-order bat, Rahul has returned to his preferred Test opening slot with renewed consistency. Since the Australia tour, he has scored 431 runs in five Tests at an average nearing 48, including this latest Leeds masterclass.Quiz: Who's that IPL player? Despite a career Test average of 34.70, Rahul says he no longer lets statistics cloud his focus. “Of course, it hurts when I look at my average. But at this stage, I don’t want to think about numbers. I want to make an impact whenever I get a chance and enjoy playing Test cricket for India and it’s what I grew up loving,” he said.Looking ahead to the final day, Rahul expects a gripping contest as India defends a stiff target. “When the match started, it looked like a batting paradise and I thought it would be a draw. But now, there’s enough wear and tear and the cracks are opening up. It’s a perfect day-five wicket and it’s going to be a blockbuster,” he said.At stumps on day four, England were 21 for no loss, with Zak Crawley and Ben Duckett navigating six tricky overs without a hiccup. The pair added quick runs to keep the chase alive, leaving the hosts needing 350 more for what would be a record chase at Headingley.Earlier, India’s lower order once again faltered, collapsing from 349/6 to 364 all out in under five overs, with only Ravindra Jadeja and the tail adding quick runs at the end. The top five, however, were outstanding — racking up five centuries between them and scoring 721 of India’s total runs in the Test.With Pant’s twin centuries and Rahul’s controlled ton, India hold the advantage heading into what promises to be a riveting final day at Leeds.","KL Rahul scores his third Test hundred on English soil to put India firmly in control of the opening Test.

Poll Who do you think played a more crucial role in the partnership against England? KL Rahul Rishabh Pant

Greenstone Lobo predicts winner of IND vs ENG series | Who Has the Astrological Edge?

Early in their partnership, the stump mic picked up a heartwarming conversation between KL Rahul and Rishabh Pant where the former was urging his younger teammate to watch the ball closely. Pant heard him and responded, ""hanji... aise nahi hai aise hi ghuma du... ball acche se dekhta hu."" (yes, it's not that I swing wildly, I watch it nicely). From the outside, it may feel like a normal conversation between two batters looking to bail the side out of trouble after the early hiccup - Shubman Gill's wicket - but it meant much more. It felt much more.There is a six-year age gap between KL Rahul and Pant, and while it's not the ideal difference between siblings of an average Indian family, the camaraderie in the middle certainly felt like one. Without being authoritative, Rahul was putting the point across to Pant with an unsaid sense of assurance in his tone. The young batter was all ears and the ""hanji"" - hindi word for yes used while addressing someone senior to you - said and conveyed a lot more.This is an Indian dressing room undergoing transition and Rahul, as far as batting is concerned, is the only link between the past and the future. Since making his debut in 2014, the right-hander has played with the former greats, seen plenty come in and out of the side and is now witnessing the youngsters - who made their debuts in front of him - take the next step in their Test careers.Rahul, however, hasn't turned that guiding angel for the young batters overnight.It was visible during the numerous net sessions in Australia where he would guide Yashasvi Jaiswal, speak to him constantly and maintain the chatter even when the two opened the innings together. It was a much star-studded dressing room back then but things have changed now. He is the senior pro who has taken the responsibility of making the youngsters comfortable.And he was doing just that when Pant walked out to bat under an overcast sky, windy conditions and against a bowling attack which was asking a lot of questions in the first hour of day's play.Pant and Rahul together wasn't going to be similar music from both ends and it was a throwback to the 90s where the audio cassettes were dominated by 2-in-1 collections. One side would have music completely different from the other. Vengaboys on one side and a Yash Chopra classic on the other meant there was something for everyone.With their own means and ways, the two drove India into a position of control. Rahul continued to be patient, calm and left the ball as well as anyone has in this part of the world. Pant, meanwhile, entered a period of self-talking where he calmed himself to weather the early storm and then returned to maverick ways before making timely returns to sensibility.Rahul faced 143 deliveries during the partnership, Pant faced 140 and the two contributed 66 and 118 runs, respectively. The contributions, however, weren't of importance here but the manner in which they complimented each other, in spite of the different approaches, was. The elder brother in Rahul didn't miss an opportunity to walk up to his teammate when he would sense him getting edgy - which happened far too often.With Pant, every delivery becomes an event but Rahul, having played so much cricket with the explosive left-hander, timed his chats to perfection and didn't come across as the overbearing senior instructing from the other end. When he was leaving consecutive deliveries in the 90s, Rahul let him be. Even when he went big off Shoaib Bashir, Rahul let him be. And when the hundred finally came, the long warm hug showed how much it meant to Pant, and Rahul, as together the two batted India into a very good position in the opening Test against England.It was shortly after that Rahul got the chance to kiss the crest on his helmet but this partnership was more than about the individual tons. Many moons ago, the two had put on a show at The Oval in 2018 when they hit hundreds vs Joe Root & Co. but it came for a side littered with superstars, led by one of the modern day-greats, Virat Kohli.The superstars have now walked into the sunset, the greats have called it a day but Rahul, who has had a ringside view to the movements and transitions, has moved up the hierarchy. He opted for Tamil when Sai Sudharsan was in the middle, Hindi for Pant and switched to Kannada for Karun Nair. The language changed but the intention remained the same.The soft-spoken tattooed youngster is now the elder brother in a very young dressing room led by a 25-year-old captain.","KL Rahul and Rishabh Pant's partnership was more than individual tons.

Greenstone Lobo predicts winner of IND vs ENG series | Who Has the Astrological Edge?

'You just let Rishabh Pant be Rishabh Pant. Stand out there and admire.' KL Rahul ’s words summed up the essence of day four at Headingley, where the Indian duo of Rahul and Pant unleashed twin centuries to propel India to 364 all out in their second innings, setting England a steep 371-run target.By stumps, England openers Zak Crawley and Ben Duckett had reached 21 without loss. The series opener remains delicately poised with 350 more needed by the hosts and one full day to go.Pant, who made 134 in the first innings, completed his second century of the match with a thrilling 118 off 140 balls - becoming the first Indian to hit twin tons in a Test against England and only the second wicketkeeper in history to achieve the feat.KL Rahul, anchoring the innings with a composed 137 off 247 balls, was at his vintage best. “Was happy with the way I was batting in Australia… Unfortunately couldn’t get big runs. I learnt there that once I get starts, I’ll convert into big ones,” he said after the day’s play.On his ever-evolving role in the batting order, he admitted: “Last couple of years I have forgotten what position I am comfortable in. I am ready for whatever has been given to me.I have enjoyed my role as an opener the last couple of series.”Rahul also spoke about helping younger players adjust to English conditions. “Everyone wants to learn, get better at their game. Whoever has come and spoken to me, we’ve had lengthy conversations. It was something that used to happen earlier also.”Despite India losing their last six wickets for 31 runs, they had done enough damage. England pacer Josh Tongue, who triggered India’s late collapse, said: “It’s a shame I couldn’t get the hat-trick… but the dressing room is very positive. We have a very good batting order.”Day five promises fireworks - or a fight for survival.","KL Rahul and Rishabh Pant hit twin centuries to propel India to 364 all out in their second innings, setting England a steep 371-run target.

KL Rahul press conference: On his role, being elder brother in team, role clarity and match

England face a formidable challenge at Headingley, needing 371 runs to win the first Test against India. After conceding a big second-innings lead, England’s openers Zak Crawley and Ben Duckett ensured they finished Day 4 at 21 for no loss, keeping hopes alive for what would be a historic chase. With Headingley famous for some of Test cricket’s most dramatic fourth-innings run chases, all eyes are on whether England can script another thrilling finish.Headingley cricket ground in Leeds has witnessed some of cricket’s most memorable run chases in Test match history, with Australia’s pursuit of 404 runs against England in 1948 standing as the highest successful chase at this venue. The historic ground has hosted five remarkable fourth-innings victories, showcasing extraordinary batting performances and match-winning partnerships that have left an indelible mark on Test cricket.The highest successful run chase at Headingley came in 1948 when Australia, led by Don Bradman, achieved a target of 404 runs with seven wickets to spare. Bradman’s unbeaten 173 and Arthur Morris’s 182 formed a partnership of 301 runs that secured this historic victory for Australia.The second-highest chase occurred in 2019 when England successfully pursued 362 runs against Australia. Ben Stokes emerged as the hero with an unbeaten 135 off 219 balls, forming a crucial last-wicket partnership with Jack Leach, who contributed just one run to the cause.West Indies achieved the third-highest chase in 2017, successfully reaching a target of 322 runs with five wickets remaining. Shai Hope’s twin centuries and Kraigg Brathwaite’s significant contribution helped the West Indies secure a memorable victory on English soil.The fourth spot belongs to England’s chase of 315 against Australia in 2001. Mark Butcher’s outstanding innings of 173 runs from 227 deliveries guided England to victory despite a shaky start at 33 for 2.The fifth-highest successful chase at Headingley was completed by England against New Zealand in 2022, when they reached the target of 296 with seven wickets in hand. Joe Root and Ollie Pope’s partnership of 134 runs off 168 balls proved crucial after England lost both openers with only 51 runs on the board.Quiz: Who's that IPL player? These successful chases at Headingley have featured remarkable individual performances. Don Bradman’s unbeaten 173 in 1948, Ben Stokes’ 135 not out in 2019, and Mark Butcher’s 173 in 2001 stand as some of the finest fourth-innings batting displays at this ground.The venue has particularly been favourable for England, who feature in four of the five highest successful chases. Three of these victories came against their traditional rivals Australia, while the other was against New Zealand.The success rate of teams batting fourth at Headingley demonstrates the ground’s potential for producing exciting finishes. The pitch characteristics and conditions have often allowed batting teams to successfully chase substantial targets.These historic chases have often involved significant partnerships. The 301-run partnership between Bradman and Morris in 1948, the last-wicket stand between Stokes and Leach in 2019, and the Root-Pope partnership in 2022 exemplify how crucial partnerships have been in successful pursuits at this venue.Each of these five chases has contributed to Headingley’s reputation as a ground capable of producing dramatic Test matches with successful fourth-innings pursuits. With a 371-run target now set, England’s current team has a chance to add its name to this famous list — but it will take something truly special to do so.","England face a formidable challenge at Headingley, needing 371 runs to win the first Test against India.

Greenstone Lobo predicts winner of IND vs ENG series | Who Has the Astrological Edge?

NEW DELHI: Sunil Gavaskar and Rishabh Pant continued to deliver viral social media moments on Day 4 of the first Test of the Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy at Headingley on Monday. Pant, the dynamic left-hander, followed up his brilliant 134 in the first innings with a superb 118 in the second, becoming the first wicketkeeper-batter to score a century in both innings of a Test match.He also became the first Indian to achieve this rare feat in England.Pant’s iconic somersault celebration had already gone viral following his first-innings century. However, he chose not to repeat the flip after reaching his eighth Test ton in the second innings.As the cameras shifted to the stands, Sunil Gavaskar was seen gesturing to Pant, urging him to perform the somersault once more. In response, Pant signalled, ""some other time.""The light-hearted exchange added another chapter to the growing on-field chemistry between Gavaskar and Pant. During the 2024–25 Border-Gavaskar Trophy, Gavaskar had famously criticised Pant’s dismissal as “Stupid. Stupid. Stupid,” only to later praise his Headingley hundred as “Superb. Superb. Superb.”Pant walked in after Indian captain Shubman Gill was dismissed in the very first over of the day by Brydon Carse.The 27-year-old began in typically aggressive and unorthodox fashion, but quickly adapted to the challenging conditions.He played cautiously before lunch, scoring 31 off 59 balls, and then launched a calculated counterattack, particularly targeting spinner Shoaib Bashir. Pant brought up his century in 130 deliveries and was eventually dismissed for 118 by Joe Root.Former India wicketkeeper Deep Dasgupta praised Pant's temperament and adaptability, comparing him to India’s resilient former batter, Cheteshwar Pujara.“The first phase of Pant’s innings was entertaining — he was trying to use the strong wind in his favour, playing those big shots. But he wasn’t quite convincing in the way he did it. Then he decided to switch gears completely. And, this is the beauty of Pant — his cricketing mind is sharp. He abandoned the aggressive shots, went all-out defense, and did not play a single aerial shot after that.“It reminded me of how versatile he is. This is the same guy who, early in his Test career, once got a 29-ball duck. He can bat like Pujara for an hour or two. We’ve seen him play at a strike rate of 30 for over an hour during hundreds that he has scored. It was fascinating to see the contrast — two very different versions of Rishabh Pant in one session,” said Deep on Jio Hotstar’s Match Centre Live.","Rishabh Pant becomes first wicketkeeper-batter to score a century in both innings of a Test match.

Jasprit Bumrah press conference: Lashes out at critics, dropped catches and no balls

Poll Do you agree with Michael Atherton's criticism of Ben Stokes' defensive tactics? Yes, I think Stokes was too defensive. No, I believe it was a strategic choice.

England’s approach on Day 4 of the first Test at Headingley has come under sharp criticism from former skipper Michael Atherton , who questioned Ben Stokes ’ defensive tactics against India’s KL Rahul and Rishabh Pant. The duo’s commanding 195-run partnership turned the game firmly in India’s favour and left England’s bowlers searching for answers.Rahul’s measured 137 off 347 deliveries combined with Pant’s counterattacking 118 off just 140 balls piled on the pressure. Despite the conditions and Headingley’s reputation for slip catches, Stokes opted to remove catchers behind the wicket during a crucial phase - a move Atherton found baffling.“England's tactics were unusual at the start of the second session as Stokes went quite defensive, and there were no slips in place. The vast majority of wickets at Headingley come in the slips, and there weren't any when Pant edged two. India pressed the accelerator after that and put the hammer down,” Atherton said on Sky Sports.Rahul’s technical discipline and Pant’s fearless strokeplay enthralled the Headingley crowd and left England’s inexperienced attack exposed.Former India coach Ravi Shastri lauded the pair’s contrasting brilliance but admitted Pant’s relentless charge gave India an unusual problem — when to declare.“Pant has taken the game forward. He has given India a headache in terms of when should they declare and how many runs do they get. There is plenty of food for thought, but India will be very happy after a technical masterpiece from Rahul and the flamboyance and exuberance that you can't imagine from Pant,” Shastri remarked.Pant’s smashing innings was ended Shoaib Bashir, who tempted him into a miscue and was caught by Zak Crawley. Rahul followed soon after, bowled off an inside edge while attempting to cut a ball that bounced extra.","Michael Atherton questioned Ben Stokes' defensive tactics against India's KL Rahul and Rishabh Pant.

Since then, elbow injuries, two surgeries, and a stress fracture in his lower back in 2022 had threatened to derail a promising career that once made him England’s spearhead across formats.But on his red-ball return, Archer wasted little time reminding everyone of his impact. In his very first outing back, he snapped up the wicket of Emilio Gay with a trademark sharp delivery that trapped the Durham batter lbw. This marked his first wicket in red-ball cricket after an absence of 1,501 days.England Test skipper Ben Stokes recently confirmed that Archer has been in regular contact with the national camp, eager to don the whites again. If his fitness holds up over the next few weeks, England could well unleash a rejuvenated Archer when India return for the high-profile Test series, with the second Test set to be played in Edgbaston.For England fans, the thought of Archer’s return will be a timely boost as the hosts look to assert their dominance over India in the coming weeks.",Jofra Archer made his comeback for Sussex against Durham on Monday. The 30-year- old pacer has been out of the England Test team for four years.

Yildiz stars for Juventus

Rudiger complains of racist insult

Manchester City hit Al Ain for six on Sunday to secure a place in the last 16 of the Club World Cup after Real Madrid shrugged off an early red card to beat Mexican side Pachuca 3-1.Juventus proved too strong for Wydad Casablanca while Red Bull Salzburg and Al Hilal drew 0-0 as the second round of group games at the tournament came to a conclusion.The match between City and Al Ain in Atlanta was dubbed the ""Abu derby"", with the English club's owner and United Arab Emirates vice-president Sheikh Mansour facing off against his elder sibling, Sheikh Mohamed, president of the Emirati team and also the country.Ilkay Gundogan put City ahead early on before 19-year-old Claudio Echeverri netted his first goal for the club with a free-kick and Erland Haaland slotted in the third with a penalty in first-half stoppage time.In the second half, Gundogan struck again before two substitutes joined in, with Oscar Bobb rolling in the fifth and Rayan Cherki grabbing his first City goal for 6-0.The result, in a game watched by a crowd of over 40,000, means both City and Juventus are through to the knockout phase after each winning their first two matches in Group G.hey will now face each other in Orlando on Thursday to decide who tops the section.""Now we have to see whether we'll be first or second in the group,"" said City coach Pep Guardiola, who changed his entire starting line-up following the 2-0 opening win against Wydad.""We played a little bit better than the first game, especially in the second half.""Juventus triumphed 4-1 against Moroccan giants Wydad in Philadelphia, as Kenan Yildiz played a starring role.The Turkish international forward scored twice after forcing the early own goal which put Juve ahead in front of almost 32,000 at Lincoln Financial Field.His shot found the net with the aid of a slight but crucial deflection off Abdelmounaim Boutouil, and Yildiz then smashed in the second on 16 minutes with a brilliant half-volley.South African winger Thembinkosi Lorch pulled one back for Wydad, but the impressive Yildiz made it 3-1 midway through the second half and Dusan Vlahovic converted a penalty in injury time to seal the win for Igor Tudor's side.""He has great potential,"" Tudor told broadcaster DAZN when asked about Yildiz. ""A wonderful player, so there is a big future in front of him.""In Charlotte, Real Madrid overcame the early sending-off of Raul Asencio to beat Pachuca and get their first win under new coach Xabi Alonso.Defender Asencio was dismissed after just seven minutes for pulling down Salomon Rondon with the Venezuelan clear on goal.That left the Liga MX team sensing the chance for an upset in front of 70,248 fans at the home of the NFL's Carolina Panthers.However, Real took the lead on 35 minutes when Jude Bellingham buried a left-foot shot into the bottom corner, and they scored again before the interval through Arda Guler.Fede Valverde got their third in the second half, with a deflected Elias Montiel effort pulling one back for Pachuca.Alonso praised the way his team handled the early sending-off.""It became really intense for us, but we defended with a lot of sacrifice and solidarity, which is what it takes,"" he said.Alonso also said that Real defender Antonio Rudiger had complained of a racist incident at the end of the game when the German was visibly angered following an exchange of words with Pachuca's Gustavo Cabral.""I think the FIFA protocol has been activated to investigate, but if it has happened, all measures should be taken and we support Antonio because it's something unacceptable,"" said the coach.Cabral, the 39-year-old Argentinian centre-back, denied the accusations, saying his words had been misinterpreted.Real are level at the top of Group H on four points with Salzburg, who drew 0-0 with Al Hilal in Washington, DC.Madrid and Salzburg meet each other next in Philadelphia, while Al Hilal have two points and can still qualify with a win when they play Pachuca, who are now out.",Manchester City beat Al Ain 6-0 in the FIFA Club World Cup.

Liverpool’s biggest-ever transfer! Florian Wirtz joins Premier League club from Bayer Leverkusen in stunning record deal,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/top-stories/liverpools-biggest-ever-transfer-florian-wirtz-joins-premier-league-club-from-bayer-leverkusen-in-stunning-record-deal/articleshow/121985525.cms,"Leverkusen's Florian Wirtz (AP Photo)

Florian Wirtz has joined Liverpool from Bayer Leverkusen for a club-record fee, following the Reds' 20th English top-flight title victory under Arne Slot. Former Liverpool midfielder and Wirtz's ex-coach Xabi Alonso has already recognised him as one of the world's best players.British media has reported that Liverpool will pay up to £116 million ($157 million) for the attacking midfielder. German sources suggest an even higher fee, beginning at 130 million euros (£111 million, $149 million) with potential add-ons reaching 150 million euros.A dispute arose between Cologne and Leverkusen five years ago when Leverkusen signed the teenage Wirtz at age 17. Cologne claimed a gentleman's agreement regarding youth players was broken, but Leverkusen maintained Wirtz was a first-team signing.Wirtz's progress was halted by a cruciate knee ligament injury in March 2022, keeping him sidelined for 10 months. Upon his return, he found Alonso as the new Leverkusen manager, leading to the club's most successful period.Under their partnership, Leverkusen ended Bayern Munich's Bundesliga dominance, securing both the league title and German Cup without losing a match in 2023/24. Wirtz celebrated the title-clinching match against Werder Bremen with his first career hat-trick, later earning the Bundesliga player of the year award.""Flo is one of the top players in the world, he's world class,"" said Real Madrid coach Alonso, who compared his protégé to Lionel Messi in terms of his understanding of the game.""Why is Messi so good? Because he knows how and when to play simple passes. Messi says: 'You're in a better position? Here, there you have the ball'. It's not always about making the most brilliant move, but the best and smartest. Florian can do that. That's why he's so good.""Both Wirtz and Alonso initially committed to staying at Leverkusen for another year. However, their Europa League final loss to Atalanta in 2023/24 marked a turning point.Bayern Munich regained control of German football the following season but failed to convince Wirtz to join them. Instead, he chose to move to the Premier League champions.""I'm really excited to have a new adventure in front of me. This was also a big point of my thoughts: that I want to have something completely new, to go out of the Bundesliga and to join the Premier League,"" said Wirtz. ""I spoke also with some players who played there and they told me that it's perfect for me and every pitch is perfect, you can enjoy every game. I'm really looking forward to playing my first game.""Despite his impressive record of 57 goals and 65 assists in 197 games for Leverkusen, Wirtz will start his Liverpool career alongside Mohamed Salah. Liverpool sees Wirtz's creative abilities as key to maintaining Salah's scoring record and supporting the team's attack.The club might sell their previous record signing, Darwin Nunez, who cost £85 million but hasn't met expectations, to offset some of their recent spending.

Dutch soccer player Quincy Promes was being extradited Friday from Dubai to the Netherlands, where he faces a prison sentence for involvement in cocaine smuggling, the prosecutor's office told The Associated Press.The Dutch public prosecution service confirmed to the AP that Promes was en route to the Netherlands, in Dutch custody. Promes, who scored seven goals in 50 international matches for the Netherlands before legal issues derailed his international career, was convicted last year of complicity in cocaine smuggling and sentenced in his absence to six years in prison.Amsterdam District Court ruled that Promes was involved in the import and export of hundreds of kilograms (pounds) of cocaine in 2020. His lawyers told judges he denied the allegations. In 2023, Promes was found guilty of stabbing his cousin in the leg and was sentenced to 18 months in prison.Both of Promes' convictions are currently under appeal. Promes, a 33-year-old former player for Ajax and Sevilla, had been playing for Spartak Moscow and living in Russia from 2021 until last year, when he was reportedly arrested in Dubai around the time that Spartak was there for friendly games.

Edoardo Mortara on being part of Mahindra Racing



Formula E Season 11 has turned out well for most teams, with new podium winners emerging in each round. At the recently held Jakarta E-Prix, it was Mahindra Racing’s Edoardo Mortara who secured his first podium of the season and the team’s second. While he’s happy to have claimed second place in Jakarta, he feels they could have achieved even more. His teammate, Nyck De Vries, was handed a ten-second time penalty for colliding with Jake Dennis as they approached the finish line.Edoardo Mortara joined Mahindra Racing in 2023 and had been chasing a podium finish ever since. Speaking after securing second place at the Jakarta E-Prix, the 38-year-old said, “I’m feeling kind of disappointed for the team because I think that more was possible for us, but actually happy for me. It’s been a long time coming, this podium, and if I look back, there were several occasions where, with a bit more luck, we could have changed it. ”Mortara found his podium opportunity when both his teammate Nyck De Vries and Andretti’s Jake Dennis were removed from contention after their collision. “But nevertheless, super happy with today’s race. I think we managed the strategy pretty well, especially with the first Attack Mode.We got a little bit unlucky with the Safety Car and Full Course Yellow because I think I could have made good use of my Attack Mode and passed Dan [Ticktum]. I was in front of him before the second Attack Mode. Nevertheless, super happy with second place and already looking forward to the next one,” he said.However, Mortara regrets that Jakarta isn't a double-header this year, unlike its last edition in 2023. ""Right from the start of the year, we're showing more and more performance, and this weekend we were really, really good. It's a shame that we only have one race here. I would have hoped to have a second one,"" he told FormulaE.com in an interview.Now running high on confidence, Mortara aims to continue the momentum in the upcoming Berlin double-header. He has achieved multiple podiums in Berlin in previous years, including one win.Reflecting on Mahindra Racing’s significant improvement this season, Mortara said, ""This year has been crucial for us. We brought some big updates in terms of software that helped us close a bit of the gap with the front-runners. I feel that now we have a package that is capable — not always, but on certain race weekends — of challenging at the front, and we probably had the best package in the race. Nevertheless, this result (Jakarta) shows great promise for the final race weekends, especially Berlin, which has always been a good one for me.

How Formula E is making an impact in Jakarta

Jakarta Race Promo: Heat, Grit & Gen3 Evo on Street Wheels | Formula E S11 R12

Formula E is not only introducing the fastest electric car, the GEN3 Evo, at the Jakarta E-Prix this year but also making an impact off the track. Several Formula E members participated in a beach clean-up on Thursday at Pantai Beach in the Ancol resort, where the race will be held. They are also engaging in local partnerships, educational initiatives, and community outreach to help reduce the environmental impact in the city.On Thursday, June 19, Formula E, Waste4Change, and over 100 volunteers—including FE team members and drivers—joined local community members for a large-scale beach clean-up. The initiative focused on conserving marine habitats and addressing waste management, a key issue in coastal Jakarta.Julia Pallé, VP of Sustainability at Formula E, said about the drive: “Plastic pollution is a growing problem that affects everyone around the world and is a growing challenge here in Jakarta — threatening both coastal habitats and the health of nearby communities. At every race, we are committed to engaging with local communities and aim to leave a place better than we found it. We are united as a championship with the community to clean the local area of plastic rubbish and ensure it is sustainably managed and not put back into landfill.To further minimize waste at the event, free hydration stations will provide water refills to reduce reliance on single-use plastic bottles. Visitors will also receive biodegradable eco-cups made from corn starch flour as an alternative to traditional plastic. Six dedicated waste stations will be set up for proper recycling and plastic waste management.Formula E has undertaken several more sustainability initiatives in Jakarta. A Formula E delegation visited the Waste4Change recycling center on Tuesday to learn about effective waste management practices and the role of the circular economy in conserving resources.On Wednesday, a school visit featured a panel talk on environmental education and youth leadership, along with art and cultural exchanges between students and Formula E members.Following the race, a paddock plant donation is scheduled. Trees and plants used during the event will be donated to local schools. After the race on Saturday, Formula E will host a ceremony on-site with local school students to mark the donation.Also Read: Jakarta E-Prix 2025: Schedule, how to watch Round 12 Formula E race, weather prediction In addition, Formula E’s Better Futures Fund is providing a €25,000 donation to Yayasan Perempuan dan Anak Amirah. The “Climateability: From the Margins to the Frontlines” project aims to empower women, people with disabilities, and youth groups most vulnerable to climate impacts. It will include inclusive leadership workshops, digital storytelling, training, and the development of a Climate Sign Language Glossary in Bisindo.","Formula E members participated in a beach clean-up on Thursday at Pantai Beach in the Ancol resort, where the race will be held.

Jakarta E‑Prix Essentials: Everything You Need to Know | Formula E Season 11, Round 12

Season 11 of the ABB FIA Formula E World Championship is coming to a close, with five races remaining on the calendar. The Jakarta E-Prix is a crucial race, and it's hard to predict who may lift the trophy in Indonesia this year. The current season has already seen seven different race winners and fifteen drivers on the podium. Not only that, but every single team has achieved a podium finish so far — a clear indication of how tight and unpredictable the competition is.Nissan's Oliver Rowland is far ahead of the competition so far, as he dominates the FIA Drivers' World Championship standings with 171 points — significantly ahead of Pascal Wehrlein, who sits in second position with 103 points for TAG Heuer Porsche. Rowland has a total of four wins and three second-place finishes this season, and he may continue his winning streak in Jakarta as well.Maserati MSG Racing’s Maximilian Gunther is being counted among the hot favourites to bag a podium at the Jakarta E-Prix. He has two wins under his belt this year and will be trying his best to maintain his stronghold in the city and add more points to his tally.He had secured third place in the Part 1 race in 2023, having started from Julius Bar Pole Position — a historic moment as Maserati's first single-seater motorsport pole since 1958.He again bagged the pole the next day of the double-header and went on to win his first race in the iconic blue livery of Maserati MSG Racing. It marked Maserati’s first single-seater championship podium since Juan Manuel Fangio's 1957 German Grand Prix victory, en route to that year’s Formula One title.Pascal Wehrlein won one of the two races at the Jakarta E-Prix’s last edition, and the TAG Heuer Porsche driver is very much in form at present, with a win in Miami and three more podium finishes in the Formula E 2025 World Championship so far. He is second in the 2025 Formula E Driver Standings with 103 points and will be aiming for a win to catch up with Rowland.Jaguar TCS Racing’s Mitch Evans has been away from the podium for a long time now after winning the first race of this season in Sao Paulo. But this could also indicate his growing hunger for a win — or at least another podium — possibly in Jakarta, before the season comes to a close. Evans had won the first edition of the Jakarta E-Prix in 2022, when three drivers crossed the line within a single second. The other two drivers were Jean-Éric Vergne and Edoardo Mortara, who took second and third positions in that Season 8 race.He also bagged the third spot on the podium in Race 2 of the Jakarta double-header in 2023. This makes him one of the strong contenders to make a comeback on the podium.Also Read: Jakarta E-Prix 2025: Schedule, how to watch Round 12 Formula E race, weather prediction Since Nick Cassidy and Sebastien Buemi have also ended their race droughts this year, one can expect a new winner in Jakarta as well. The E-Prix begins on Friday with the free practice session and will conclude on Saturday with the final race in the early evening. The heat is on — but rain is likely, and that’s enough to add to the unpredictability factor.","Season 11 of the ABB FIA Formula E World Championship is coming to a close.

'I had so much hate'

London: Carlos Alcaraz warned his Wimbledon rivals that he ""feels great"" on grass after the world number two defied his own expectations by winning the Queen's Club title for a second time.Alcaraz battled to a bruising 7-5, 6-7 (5/7), 6-2 victory over Czech world number 30 Jiri Lehecka in the final of the Wimbledon warm-up event on Sunday.The 22-year-old has extended his career-best winning streak to 18 matches, putting him in the perfect position to defend his Wimbledon title.Alcaraz has won the French Open, the Rome Masters and Queen's during his blistering run.But the five-time Grand Slam champion had arrived in west London concerned about his ability to make the tricky transition from the clay-court season to the unique demands of the brief grass campaign.Underling the difficulty of the task, Alcaraz is the first player to win Roland Garros and Queen's back to back since Rafael Nadal in 2008.""I'm going to say it's really complicated, the switch from clay to grass in just few days, because that's the time I had before the tournament began, just two days of practising,"" Alcaraz said.""So I came here with no expectations at all. I came here with a goal to play two or three matches, try to feel great on grass, and give myself the feedback of what I have to improve.""But I got used to the grass really quick, and I'm really proud about it. My goal was complete, and I'm not talking about lifting the trophy or making the final.""It was just to feel great, to feel really comfortable on grass once again.""For a player raised on the clay courts of Spain, Alcaraz has become a formidable force on the lawns of Queen's and Wimbledon.He is only the third Spanish man to win four grass-court tournaments after Nadal and Feliciano Lopez.""It's great to be with Rafa and Feli, such great players from our country,"" he said.""Hopefully now I will not stop here. Hopefully keep going.""A key part of Alcaraz's winning formula is his ability to switch off from tennis after tournaments to ensure he is refreshed when he returns to the court.The former world number one partied in Ibiza after his epic five-set French Open final triumph against Jannik Sinner earlier this month.He won't have time for a similar holiday before Wimbledon starts on June 30, but he plans to relax as much as possible in London before focusing on his bid for a third successive All England Club crown.""A lot of people ask me the same question: Are you going to go back to Ibiza? I wish! As I said, I'm a player who needs days off to enjoy, days for myself to spend with my friends, with my family, just to turn off my mind,"" he said.""I can't go back home. I'm going to stay here in London, hopefully enjoy it a little bit, then be back and preparing Wimbledon the best way possible.""While Sinner crashed out in the Halle second round against Alexander Bublik this week, Alcaraz's success at Queen's moved his record since losing to David Goffin at the Miami Masters in March to a formidable 27-1.Alcaraz believes that defeat was a transformative moment in his season.""I had so much hate when I lost in Miami. A lot of people started to say 'What's going on with this guy. He just lost in the first round, and he didn't practice, he didn't go to the court',"" Alcaraz said.""I think that was the key, just to have five, six days off, not grabbing a racquet, not stepping on the court. Just go to vacation with my family, to turn off my mind, to think what should I have done better?""I just got the joy back. I started to enjoy playing tennis again, realising what is the most important thing for me.""","Carlos Alcaraz wins Queen's Club title for second time. Beats Jiri Lehecka 7-5, 6-7 (5/7), 6-2 in the final on Sunday. World number two extends his winning streak to 18 matches. He is the first player to win Roland Garros and Queen's back to back since Rafael Nadal.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122014918,imgsize-66630,width-400,resizemode-4/122014918.jpg"

- Ruthless Alcaraz -

L ONDON: Carlos Alcaraz clinched his second Queen's Club title as the world number two warmed up for Wimbledon with a 7-5, 6-7 (5/7), 6-2 win against Jiri Lehecka in Sunday's final. Alcaraz blasted 33 winners and 18 aces to subdue the gritty Czech world number 30 in two hours and 10 minutes in west London.Having won titles on clay at the French Open, Rome and Monte Carlo, as well as the hard courts of Rotterdam, Alcaraz has now collected five trophies in 2025.The 22-year-old has not lost since the Barcelona final against Holger Rune on April 20 and is enjoying the longest winning streak of his career with 18 successive victories.Top seeded Alcaraz is just the second Spanish man to win Queen's twice after Feliciano Lopez, who lifted the trophy in 2017 and 2019.""I'm happy to lift this trophy once again. It's a nightmare to play against Jiri, but it's been an incredible week,"" Alcaraz said.""I came without expectations. I just wanted to play good tennis and get used to the grass.""It's really special playing here every year. I can't wait to come back next year.""For a player raised on the clay courts of Spain, Alcaraz has developed into a formidable force on grass.The former world number one signalled his emergence on the surface by winning Queen's in 2023.He clinched the Wimbledon title for the first time just weeks later and defended his All England Club crown last year.Alcaraz, who has an 11-1 career record at Queen's, will start his bid for a third successive Wimbledon title on June 30.After his semi-final win over Roberto Bautista Agut on Saturday, Alcaraz fired an ominous message to his Wimbledon rivals, warning that his ""grass-court mode"" had been activated.And on the evidence of his relentless display against the obdurate Lehecka, he is in no mood to surrender his All England Club crown.Playing his first tournament since his epic French Open victory against Jannik Sinner two weeks ago, Alcaraz's march to the Queen's showpiece made it five consecutive finals for the Spaniard.In contrast, Lehecka was playing in his first grass-court final after a shock win against British star Jack Draper in the last four.The 23-year-old was the first Czech in the Queen's final since Ivan Lendl in 1990.Lehecka had come from a set down to stun Alcaraz in the Qatar Open quarter-finals in February.But there would be no repeat of that upset on the lawns of Barons Court.In his second Queen's final, Alcaraz had an early chance to break in the fifth game of the first set.Lehecka thundered down an ace to get out of trouble of that occasion.But the five-time Grand Slam champion matched Lehecka's serve blow for blow, dropping just one point in his first four service games.Alcaraz's piercing ground-strokes increased the pressure and Lehecka finally cracked in the the 11th game when an badly-timed double-fault gifted the first break to the Spaniard.Alcaraz served out the set in typically ruthless fashion, but Lehecka refused to surrender without a fight.A tight second set stayed on serve all the way through to the tie-break and, for once, Alcaraz stumbled with a key double-fault, allowing Lehecka to level the match.Alcaraz was unfazed, breaking for a 3-1 lead in the deciding set when Lehecka netted an off-balance forehand.Alcaraz had the finish line in sight and he wrapped up his latest title triumph with a flurry of searing winners.","Carlos Alcaraz beats Jiri Lehecka 7-5, 6-7 (5/7), 6-2 to win Queen's Club title. World number two is just the second Spanish man to win the tournament twice. The 22-year-old has not lost since the Barcelona final on April 20. He is enjoying the longest winning streak of his career with 18 successive victories.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122008446,imgsize-62112,width-400,resizemode-4/122008446.jpg"

VONDROUSOVA SURPRISES SABALENKA TO REACH BERLIN FINAL

MUNICH: Russian Daniil Medvedev dispatched home favourite Alexander Zverev in three sets to reach the finals of the ATP tournament in Halle on Saturday.The world number 11 came through 7-6 (7/3), 6-7 (3/7), 6-4 after an exceptional baseline battle lasing just under three hours.On Sunday, Medvedev will play in his first final on the tour since March 2024, against either fellow Russian Karen Khachanov or Kazakhstan's Alexander Bublik.It was the 20th clash between two players of the same generation with Medvedev, 29, now leading 28-year-old Zverev 13-7.A finalist in Stuttgart last week Zverev had been hoping to go one better on the grass of Halle after being a losing finalist at the tournament in 2016 and 2017.But former world number one Medvedev once against proved a tough opponent for the second seed, having won 12 of their last 14 duels, the last in the semi-finals of the Australian Open at the end of January 2024.The 2021 US Open winner and two-time Wimbledon semi-finalist in 2023 and 2024, Medvedev squandered a break lead 2-0 and three early match points on Zverev's serve (6-5) in the second set, and was pushed into a decisive third set.But he wrapped up the match just under an hour later on his fifth opportunity with a forehand winner sending him through to his second final in Halle where he finished runner-up in 2022.For his 21st tour title, his first since his triumph on the clay courts of Rome in May 2023, Medvedev will challenge either 22nd-ranked Khachanov, or 2023 Halle winner Bublik, ranked 45, who claimed the scalp of world number one Jannik Sinner in the second round.Carlos Alcaraz reached the Queen's Club final for the second time as the world number two eased to a 6-4, 6-4 win over Roberto Bautista Agut on Saturday.Alcaraz extended his career-best winning streak to 17 matches in a semi-final played in sweltering conditions at the Wimbledon warm-up event in west London.The five-time Grand Slam champion hit 36 winners and 15 aces to dispatch his fellow Spaniard in 90 minutes.Top seeded Alcaraz will face Jiri Lehecka in Sunday's final after the Czech world number 30's shock 6-4, 4-6, 7-5 win against British star Jack Draper in the other semi-final.Playing his first tournament since his epic French Open victory against Jannik Sinner two weeks ago, the 22-year-old is through to his fifth successive final after lifting titles on clay in Paris, Rome, Barcelona and Monte Carlo.Alcaraz signalled his emergence as a grass-court force by winning Queen's in 2023, clinching the Wimbledon title for the first time just weeks later and defending his All England Club crown last year.He is one victory away from becoming only the second Spaniard to win Queen's twice, after Feliciano Lopez's victories in 2017 and 2019.Alcaraz wasted little time taking control against Bautista Agut, unfurling a deft drop-shot to break in the third game of the match.That was all the encouragement Alcaraz needed as he held serve with ease to close out the first set.Bautista Agut, 37, enjoyed a surprise win over Danish fourth seed Holger Rune in the last eight.But Alcaraz never looked like suffering the same fate and he delivered the knockout blow in the second set.A whipped forehand down the line earned a break-point that he converted to move 3-2 ahead.The nerveless Alcaraz finished off the win in typically ruthless fashion to the delight of the fans waving Spanish flags to salute their hero.Marketa Vondrousova brushed aside world number one Aryna Sabalenka in Berlin on Saturday to reach her first final since lifting the Wimbledon title two years ago.The 25-year-old Czech, ranked 164 in the world rankings, dominated Sabalenka 6-2, 6-4, to set up a title clash on Sunday with Wang Xinyu after the Chinese qualifier downed Liudmila Samsonova 6-4, 6-1.Vondrousova plummeted down the rankings from sixth after missing several months with a left shoulder injury for which she underwent surgery last year.""I didn't play for a long time,"" said Vondrousova, who was appearing in her first WTA semi-final since April last year.""I'm just happy to be back healthy, and so grateful to play these matches.""When I saw the field here, I was like, 'OK, let's just try to win the first round,' and then, you know, now this is happening.""Sabalenka's first serve let her down in the opening set, but the Belarusian fought back to start the second with a break.Two games down Vondrousova levelled at 2-2, then broke to lead 5-4, wrapping up the win -- her first ever over a world number one -- but not before saving three consecutive break points, with an ace after one hour five minutes of play.Sabalenka, 27, was losing only her first semi-final in eight last four appearances in 2025.Wang, Vondrousova's Sunday rival on the grass in Berlin, continued her ""dream"" run, adding the scalp of Russian Samsonova to those already collected this week including French Open champion Coco Gauff.For the 23-year-old, Sunday is a landmark moment - her first singles final on the WTA circuit.""This week has been a dream for me,"" Wang said.""I've been playing unbelievable tennis here. I don't know, it's something with Berlin, I guess!""Coming into this match here, coming into every match, I wasn't expecting anything, you know. For me, it was really just to enjoy the stage.""Vondrousova in contrast is appearing in her sixth final, winning in Bern (2017), Wimbledon (2023), and she was a losing finalist at Roland Garros and at the Tokyo Olympics in 2021.","Daniil Medvedev will play in his first final on the tour since March 2024, against either fellow Russian Karen Khachanov or Kazakhstan's Alexander Bublik. The world number 11 came through 7-6 (7/3), 6-7 (3/7),6-4 after an exceptional baseline battle lasing just under three hours. Carlos Alcaraz will face Jiri Lehecka in Sunday's final after the Czech world number 30's shock 6-4, 4-6, 7-5 win against British star Jack Draper.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121996685,imgsize-70076,width-400,resizemode-4/121996685.jpg"

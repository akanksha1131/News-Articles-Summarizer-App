NEW DELHI: Mumbai Indians held their nerve better in a pressure-cooker Eliminator to outclass Gujarat Titans by 20 runs in a high-scoring IPL 2025 clash on Friday. Rohit Sharma (81 off 50) capitalised on early chances to play a pivotal knock, while Jonny Bairstow (47 off 22) made an instant impact on debut, powering MI to a commanding 228 for five in their 20 overs.After sealing a place in Qualifier 2, Player of the Match Rohit Sharma expressed pride in his side's all-round effort.""I have got only four fifties. Would have loved to score more fifties. Good day for us as a team. I do understand the importance of playing this Eliminator and going through this and taking the next step forward. Really proud of a complete team effort,"" Rohit said at the post-match presentation.""When I play the game, I try to do my best keeping everything aside. Making sure how I can do the job for the team. I had to make the most of the luck. I am glad I could do that. Get the team into a good position. It was going to be challenging with the dew coming. The bowlers held their nerves really well. To be honest, I have played those shots before in the tournament and found fielders.""Somewhere down the line you got to be lucky and today was that day for me. I got lucky as those catches were dropped.But even after that you got to play. I was focussing on keeping the momentum and tempo going. Was a good bowling effort. Jonny I have watched him over the years from the other side. We know the quality he has. Lot of experience playing in this format. Never looked like he was playing the first game. We got the start and capitalized on it,"" Rohit said.Mumbai Indians will now face Punjab Kings in Qualifier 2 in Ahmedabad on Sunday. The winner will meet Royal Challengers Bengaluru in the IPL 2025 final on June 3.Gujarat Titans, despite being erratic in the field and with the ball, managed to stay in the hunt thanks to a masterful knock from Sai Sudharsan (80 off 49), but eventually fell short at 208 for six, bowing out of the tournament.Ultimately, it was Mumbai who won the crucial moments to stay alive in the playoffs. Despite the heavy dew, chasing down such a mammoth total in a knockout match demanded something extraordinary — and Sudharsan nearly delivered just that before his dismissal in the 16th over tilted the contest.Bumrah’s trademark yorker accounted for Washington Sundar (48 off 24), and Richard Gleeson struck the decisive blow by dismantling Sudharsan’s stumps when the left-hander missed a scoop, turning the tide in MI’s favour.While he was at the crease, Sudharsan’s strokeplay was a sight to behold. In a match dominated by brute power, the elegant left-hander stood out, threading gaps with surgical precision and timing.With the equation down to 36 off 12 balls, and left-handers Rahul Tewatia and Sherfane Rutherford at the crease, MI debutant Gleeson was handed the final over with 24 runs needed.

It was a night that saw Mumbai Indians flex their championship mettle once again. In a record-breaking IPL Eliminator in Mullanpur — where both teams combined for a staggering 436 runs, the highest ever in playoff history — MI held their nerve to beat Gujarat Titans by 20 runs and march into Qualifier 2.While the scoreboard lit up with sixes and boundaries, it was Mumbai’s ability to win the clutch moments that stood out. Skipper Hardik Pandya , facing his former franchise in a high-pressure knockout, was full of praise for his team’s temperament and timing.“At one point of time the game was even-stevens,” Pandya said after the win. “I thought the wicket got better in the second innings. It started to come on well, they got into rhythm and we realised we need to hold our nerves and back our boys.”He singled out Jonny Bairstow’s explosive debut knock and Rohit Sharma ’s composed 81 as pivotal. “The way Jonny batted and started... for him to make his debut for us, it's a special franchise, coming in and playing the way he played. The way Ro batted — he took his time and once he got into rhythm, it was beautiful.”Pandya also praised his bowling unit, particularly Richard Gleeson’s final over under injury duress and Jasprit Bumrah ’s clinical spell.“The way Gleeson bowled. Jassi being Jassi. Ashwani... everyone chipped in well and we held our nerves. I would've liked couple more (big hits). The little margins help. We wanted to push in batting and I think we were able to do that.”Asked when he decides to bowl Bumrah, Pandya smiled: “It's very simple. Whenever you think the game is going away, just bring him. When you have that it's a luxury. It's like Mumbai housing prices – he's that expensive.”The final overs were tense, but Pandya had it planned. “I was just watching the scoreboard and I thought if we can keep extra runs at the end, I had the bowlers to bowl it. It was important that Jassi comes and bowls that over so that the margin becomes longer (the 18th over). Very important to recover well. Looking forward to the next game.”With this victory, Mumbai Indians set up a Qualifier 2 clash against Punjab Kings in Ahmedabad on June 1.

Sabalenka shrugs off the pressure

Poll Who do you think has the best chance of winning the French Open this year? Carlos Alcaraz Iga Swiatek Aryna Sabalenka Elena Rybakina

Musetti, Rune battle through





Carlos Alcaraz survived a scare to book his place in the French Open last 16 on Friday, with defending women's champion Iga Swiatek and Aryna Sabalenka also through to the fourth round at Roland Garros.Second seed Alcaraz won 6-1, 6-3, 4-6, 6-4 against 69th-ranked Bosnian Damir Dzumhur in the night session to keep his title defence on course.Four-time Grand Slam champion Alcaraz arrived as the favourite at Roland Garros after securing the Monte Carlo Masters and Italian Open trophies in the build-up to the clay-court major.But his fluctuating performances in the past two rounds have given his rivals reason to believe he is vulnerable.""Today I honestly didn't enjoy it that much. I suffered quite a lot,"" said a relieved Alcaraz, who came from a break down in the fourth set to seal victory.""That's why doing a really good result in a Grand Slam is really difficult because you have to maintain a really high level for three to four hours.""The 22-year-old next meets American 13th seed Ben Shelton who eased past Italian qualifier Matteo Gigante 6-3, 6-3, 6-4.Swiatek kept her bid for a fourth consecutive French Open title on track, coming through 6-2, 7-5 against Romania's world number 60 Jaqueline Cristian in sweltering conditions.Swiatek broke the 60th-ranked Cristian twice in a comfortable first set, but she was pushed a lot harder by her rival in the second and had to save six break points.""She really stepped up in the second set. I had to step up as well. It was an entertaining match,"" said Swiatek, hoping to become the first woman to win four successive Roland Garros titles since Suzanne Lenglen 102 years ago.The 23-year-old Pole will next play 12th seed Elena Rybakina after the Kazakh dispatched 2017 champion Jelena Ostapenko 6-2, 6-2 in a clash of big hitters.Swiatek has a 4-4 record against Rybakina but has lost both previous meetings on clay. However she was relieved at avoiding Ostapenko, who is 6-0 against her.A grinning Swiatek suggested earlier she had no preference as to her last-16 opponent before asking: ""Am I a good liar?""""Let's say it doesn't matter, really. Oh, my God. I couldn't play poker,"" joked the world number five who has not won a title since last year's French Open.Sabalenka produced a dominant display in a 6-2, 6-3 win over 34th-ranked Serbian left-hander Olga Danilovic.But the Madrid Open winner, whose best result at Roland Garros was a semi-final in Paris two years ago, insisted the pressure was on Swiatek.""Let's just leave it (the pressure) on Iga (Swiatek) since she won it, what, three times in a row,"" said Sabalenka.The 27-year-old Belarusian next plays 16th-seeded American Amanda Anisimova who ousted Danish 22nd seed Clara Tauson 7-6 (7/4), 6-4 in their third-round tie.Zheng Qinwen ended the run of Canadian teenager Victoria Mboko 6-3, 6-4.The Chinese eighth seed has now won nine successive matches at Roland Garros following her run to Olympic gold last year.Zheng is through to the fourth round in Paris for the second time and will next play Russian 19th seed Liudmila Samsonova who brushed aside Ukraine's Dayana Yastremska 6-2, 6-3.Italian fourth seed Paolini eased past Ukrainian lucky loser Yuliia Starodubtseva 6-4, 6-1.Runner-up last year at Roland Garros and Wimbledon, Paolini next plays Ukrainian 13th seed Elina Svitolina who dug deep to see off American Bernarda Pera 7-6 (7/4), 7-6 (7/5).Eighth seed Musetti won 4-6, 6-4, 6-3, 6-2 against Argentine Mariano Navone as he follows on from his runner-up finish in Monte Carlo and semi-final runs in Madrid and Rome.But the Italian dropped his first set in Paris against world number 97 Navone.""I've grown up a lot. A match like this I don't know if I would (have) come back a few years ago,"" said Musetti.""The heat was pretty tough to manage. But happy to find a way to turn around the match.""Musetti next plays Rune who was two points from defeat in the fourth set before rallying past France's Quentin Halys 4-6, 6-2, 5-7, 7-5, 6-2.American Tommy Paul, the 12th seed, got past Russian Karen Khachanov 6-3, 3-6, 7-6 (9/7), 3-6, 6-3 and meets Australian Alexei Popyrin, the 25th seed, who beat Portugal's Nuno Borges 6-4, 7-6 (13/11), 7-6 (7/5).Arthur Fils, the 14th seed, withdrew ahead of his third-round match on Saturday, extending the host nation's wait for a first men's champion at Roland Garros since Yannick Noah in 1983.","Carlos Alcaraz beats Damir Dzumhur to reach French Open last 16. Defending women's champion Iga Swiatek beats Jaqueline Cristian 6-2, 7-5.

'I don't want to be a one-season wonder': Punjab Kings' Shashank Singh





A day after a one-sided affair in Qualifier 1, the Eliminator between Gujarat Titans (GT) and Mumbai Indians (MI) proved to be exactly what the doctor ordered at the New PCA Stadium in Mullanpur. It went down to the wire as MI defeated GT by 20 runs. MI will now take on Punjab Kings in Qualifier 2 on Sunday at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Gujarat.Rohit Sharma (81 off 50 balls; 9x4, 4x6) made the most of two reprieves offered by GT fielders as the five-time champions delivered a strong statement in the must-win match. After winning the toss, MI posted a formidable 228 for 5.Rohit was dropped twice—first by Gerald Coetzee and then by Kusal Mendis—and he made GT pay for those missed chances. In the second over, Prasidh Krishna banged one in short, and Rohit miscued a pull high into the air. Coetzee had enough time, kept his eyes on the ball, but shelled the skier. Rohit was on 4 at the time, looking to break free with a swivel pull.In the next over, Rohit dispatched two delightful boundaries off Mohammed Siraj. Siraj could’ve had the last laugh, but Mendis fumbled a thick edge behind the stumps—failing to grab it in two attempts.The fourth over completely turned the tide in MI’s favour, as Jonny Bairstow hammered 26 runs off Prasidh Krishna’s second over—featuring three sixes, including a monster hit into the second tier at Mullanpur.Making his first appearance of the season, Bairstow came out firing on all cylinders. He and Rohit forged a rollicking 84-run opening partnership, with 79 of those runs coming in the powerplay. Bairstow blazed his way to a 22-ball 47 before falling to Sai Kishore.The powerplay onslaught set the tone, and the rest of the MI batting unit kept the momentum going. Suryakumar Yadav (33 off 20 balls; 1x4, 3x6) and Tilak Varma (25 off 11; 3x6) chipped in with impactful cameos. Captain Hardik Pandya (22* off 9; 3x6) provided the finishing touches, smashing Coetzee for 22 runs in the final over.Prasidh Krishna (2/53) and Sai Kishore (2/42) took two wickets each, but most of GT’s bowlers proved expensive. However, Team India management and Test captain Shubman Gill may be concerned after Mohammed Siraj, who dismissed Tilak Varma in the 18th over, appeared to pull his hamstring later in the same over.Sai Sudharsan continues to redefine orthodoxy in T20 cricket. His classical technique offers a refreshing counter to the notion that T20 cricket is eroding traditional skills. In this IPL season, Sudharsan has shown that the two formats—Test and T20—can indeed coexist. While broadcasters may try to strip away the “cricket” from T20, players like Sudharsan keep putting it right back in.On Friday, the 23-year-old produced yet another masterclass. He scored a classy 80 off 49 balls, laced with 10 boundaries and a six. Despite his aggressive approach, Sudharsan rarely loses shape, showcasing a full range of proper cricketing shots.GT’s chase began on a poor note, with Trent Boult removing skipper Shubman Gill for just 1. But Sudharsan continued in red-hot form, hitting a six off Boult and finding support in Kusal Mendis, who launched two sixes in the same over. The duo kept the momentum going, especially as Sudharsan struck two boundaries off Richard Gleeson’s first over.Hardik Pandya brought himself on but was welcomed with two boundaries from Sudharsan and one from Mendis, who narrowly escaped a run-out at the end of the powerplay. However, Mendis was soon out in bizarre fashion—hit wicket after stepping on the stumps and falling flat on his back.Sudharsan found another able partner in Washington Sundar (48 off 24), and together they stitched an 84-run stand off just 46 balls. At that point, GT looked well on course to make Qualifier 2. But Jasprit Bumrah, the ultimate T20 cheat code, yorked Sundar to break the stand.Shortly after, Gleeson dismissed Sudharsan, effectively ending GT’s hopes. Lower-order efforts from Sherfane Rutherford (24), Rahul Tewatia (16), and Shahrukh Khan (16) weren’t enough, as MI held their nerves and marched on to the next round.",Mumbai Indians defeated Gujarat Titans by 20 runs in IPL Qualifier 2.

Why no Shreyas Iyer for England tour? Coach Gautam Gambhir opens up





NEW DELHI: Karun Nair oozed elegance with a sublime unbeaten 186, issuing a timely reminder to the Gautam Gambhir-led team management as India A piled on 409/3 against a lacklustre England Lions side on the opening day of the first 'Unofficial' Test in Canterbury on Friday.Although traditionally slotted at No. 4 or lower in first-class cricket, Nair looked at complete ease throughout his masterclass innings, rendering the Lions attack — including their Test spinner Rehan Ahmed — largely ineffective.India A batters capitalised on an underwhelming bowling effort on a docile pitch, but the lack of resistance from the Lions and the nature of the surface may not offer an accurate gauge of Test-level conditions.Now representing Vidarbha, the Bengaluru-born Nair put his county experience with Northamptonshire to good use, notching up his 24th first-class century. His classy knock, laced with 24 boundaries and a six, couldn’t have come at a better time as the Indian think-tank weighs up its options for the opening Test against England at Leeds on June 20. Sarfaraz Khan, who smashed a vibrant 92 off 119 balls , mixed audacity with finesse but fell short of a well-deserved hundred after doing all the hard work.Together, Sarfaraz and Nair stitched a 181-run stand for the third wicket.Later, Dhruv Jurel joined the party with an unbeaten 82 off 104 balls, forming a 177-run unbroken partnership with Nair to end the day on a commanding note for India A.Ironically, much like in the selection race for the Test squad where Nair edged out Sarfaraz, he once again outshone the Mumbai batter on a pitch offering little for the bowlers. The Lions attack, toothless for the most part, leaked 51 boundaries and three sixes across 90 overs — an alarming stat.Earlier, Yashasvi Jaiswal (24 off 55) saw off the first hour but failed to convert the start, while Abhimanyu Easwaran (8) once again raised questions about his suitability for the top level despite being handed another opportunity.Despite the greenish tinge on the Canterbury County ground surface, there was barely any lateral movement. Nair, with ample time to play his shots, was ruthless on anything short and majestic with square-of-the-wicket play. His pull shots were particularly commanding, while against off-spinner Dan Mousley, he reverse-swept with nonchalant ease.Rehan Ahmed had a forgettable outing, conceding 95 runs in 16 overs. Sarfaraz took him on confidently — reaching his fifty with an inside-out boundary and later lofting him straight for a six. Against pace, he was equally inventive, using the bounce to ramp deliveries over the slips.Sarfaraz eventually fell chasing a wide one down leg-side off Hull, a wicket even the Lions bowlers didn’t seem to expect. But the joy was fleeting for the home side as Nair and Jurel pressed on relentlessly, showing no signs of easing up.","India A piled on 409/3 against a lacklustre England Lions side on the opening day of the first 'Unofficial' Test in Canterbury.

Former Pakistan speedster Shoaib Akhtar has landed in legal trouble after making allegedly defamatory comments about cricket analyst and broadcaster Nauman Niaz. The controversy stems from Akhtar’s remarks during a recent podcast, where he referred to Niaz as a “kit man” during their time together with the Pakistan national team.“Dr Nauman basically used to carry our bags and luggage for us in the team,” Akhtar claimed in the discussion, further adding, “That is what he did in the team.

The notice states that failure to comply will lead to further legal action, including the pursuit of monetary damages.The relationship between the two has been turbulent in the past. In 2021, Niaz infamously asked Akhtar to leave a live PTV show following an on-air disagreement, which led to public outrage.

Mahela Jayawardene on Rohit Sharma: 'You cannot replace the experience'

Poll What do you think was Abdul Ismail's greatest contribution to Mumbai cricket? His swing bowling technique Mentoring younger players Consistency in domestic matches Inspiration to aspiring cricketers





Former Mumbai pacer Abdul Ismail, known as the 'king of swing bowling' in his heydays, and was a part of Mumbai's 'golden generation' of cricketers who won the Ranji Trophy title for 15 consecutive seasons in the 60s & 70s, passed away at the age of 79 due to cardiac arrest on Friday. Son of a taxi driver, Ismail, who was born in 1945, was an Oshiwara resident. He bagged 244 wickets in 75 first-class games at a fantastic average of 18.04. Though he didn’t play for the national team, his son Asif went on to play Davis Cup for India.""His contribution to Mumbai cricket and the famed Shivaji Park Gymkhana was wonderful,"" former India skipper Dilip Vengsarkar told TOI. Speaking to TOI, Sandeep Patil, India's 1983 World Cup-winning team, mourned the fact that three of Mumbai cricket and the famed Shivaji Park Gymkhana stalwarts - former Mumbai captain Milind Rege, domestic left-arm spin legend Paddy Shivalkar and Ismail have passed away within a short period this year. Rege passed away on Feb 19, while Shivalkar expired on March 3.""It's so, so sad that the golden trio of Mumbai cricket-Abdul Ismail, Paddy Shivalkar and Milind Rege has passed away in such a short time - within a period of the last two months. I started my career with all these three and I remember bowling 44.4 overs in my first match (for Mumbai) against Hyderabad with Abdul being there to guide me. I played as a bowler. It's very sad to hear about his demise,"" Patil said.According to the old-timers Ismail came close to being picked for India after starring in Mumbai's thrilling 48-run triumph in the 1970-71 Ranji Trophy final against Maharashtra at the Brabourne Stadium in the Cricket Club Of India, taking seven wickets for 58 runs-four for 41 & three for 17), but sadly missed out on the 1971 tour of England, before missing out. ""You talk about all those great swing bowlers-Bob Massie, Jimmy Anderson, Manoj Prabhakar, Balwinder Singh Sandhu. Abdul Ismail was, I think above all those guys,"" Patil praised.During his childhood, Ismail had no means to play even tennis-ball cricket, but looking at his passion, a Maharashtrian Kerkar family provided him everything so he could play at Mazgaon’s Hasanabag ground. “What I am today is because of the Kerkar family. They really took care of me. We had no money. My father was the only earning member and he used to get annoyed seeing me on the ground. Every day I would go to banks and offices and beg for a job,” Ismail had told veteran journalist Makarand Waingankar who wrote a feature on him for the ‘Bombay Boys’ series for TOI in January 2013. Speaking about his action, Ismail remembered, “For one year I was in Ruia College. When our coach Mohini Amladi watched me for the first time, he told me to correct my action in 8 days but I just couldn’t change anything. He allowed me to bowl with the same action.”In that article, Former India batsman Brijesh Patel recalled, “Ismail was a very good bowler, deceptive with his weird action. With both swings, he made batsmen play. The quality of balls used was poor those days and the ball would lose its shine, but Abdul would be at you all the time. He should have played for India.”In 1974, when Karnataka ended Bombay’s streak of winning the Ranji Trophy 15 times in a row in the semifinal at Bangalore’s Chinnaswamy stadium, it was an umpiring decision involving Ismail that hurt them. After having elected to bat, Karnataka lost Vijay Kumar off the first ball to a lovely outswinger from Ismail that he edged to Sunil Gavaskar at first slip. Karnataka would have been 0 for 2 when Ismail trapped local hero Gundappa Viswanath plumb in front of the wicket with an in-swinger, but was denied by the umpire. Viswanath went on to score 162 and in the company of Brijesh Patel (105) tore the Bombay attack. Eventually, Bombay, chasing Karnataka’s 385, lost the match.It was just Ismail's wretched luck that both cricketers were denied the chance to play for India.",Abdul Ismail passed away at the age of 79 due to cardiac arrest.

NEW DELHI: As English wicket-keeper batter Jonny Bairstow walked out to bat in his 100th Test at Dharamsala in 2024, Rohit Sharma was heard remarking, 'Isko kuch bhi daal' (Bowl any delivery to him). Rohit clearly didn't think much of Bairstow's capabilities. Even IPL franchises expressed a lack of confidence as the English cricketer went unsold in the IPL 2025 auction.However, an unexpected twist of fate soon saw Bairstow walking out to the middle with Rohit Sharma in the IPL 2025 Eliminator against Gujarat Titans (GT). The English cricketer earned this recall after scoring 525 runs across 12 innings for Yorkshire at an average of 52.50 in the 2025 County Championship. The 35-year-old cricketer wasn't included in England's squads for their ODI and T20I series against West Indies, fuelling his desire to impress even more.However, there was a stern challenge in store for Bairstow up front as IPL 2025's leading wicket-taker Prasidh Krishna (25 dismissals) ran in to bowl the second over. Krishna had single-handedly helped GT dominate a league match against MI in Ahmedabad, picking two wickets and conceding just 18 runs. The pacer was well capable of delivering similar heroics if allowed to settle in the Eliminator.However, Bairstow put Krishna on the back foot from the first delivery itself, slicing the ball over point for a boundary. The English cricketer continued to dominate in the pacer's second over, smashing him for 26 runs following three sixes and two fours. Bairstow's hammering badly shook the pacer's confidence, rendering him ineffective in a do-or-die encounter. Usually, one of GT's most economical bowlers, Krishna conceded 53 runs during his spell, finishing as the team's second most expensive bowler.The English cricketer's 26-run over against Krishna reminded many of the manner in which Virender Sehwag deflated Umar Gul's confidence during the World Cup 2011 semi-final, smashing him for 21 runs in an over. Gul similarly failed to recover from Sehwag's blows early in the encounter, conceding 69 runs in 8 overs without picking a wicket.Bairstow and Rohit smashed the ball to all corners of the ground, recording MI's highest power-play score in IPL 2025 with 79 runs on the board. While the English cricketer was eventually dismissed for 47 runs off 22 balls in a knock comprising four fours and three sixes, Bairstow set a solid platform for MI, enabling them to post a match-winning total of 228.However, the English cricketer's heroics under pressure are no surprise as revealed by power-hitting coach Julian Wood, who worked with Bairstow while representing Punjab Kings (PBKS) as well as the national team.""People said, 'He's at the end of his career'. But, Bairstow is a fighter and at his most dangerous when his back is against the wall and he has to prove people wrong. He can hit any length which makes him very dangerous in the powerplay. Bairstow is very ruthless which makes him stand out a lot,"" said Wood during an exclusive interaction with TimesofIndia.com.""One thing which I noted especially during his knock against MI was the manner in which he handled back-of-length deliveries. I had a discussion with Bairstow during his PBKS stint over playing such deliveries with a slightly angled bat rather than a straight bat. He tried to execute my instructions against Josh Hazlewood in an IPL match and enjoyed great success, smashing him for 60 runs in four overs. Bairstow kept hitting him for a six over mid-wicket and square leg,"" added Wood.While Bairstow's fanbase in Mumbai will certainly rise following this knock, he may have well earned greater respect in the eyes of 'The Hitman' himself.",Jonny Bairstow played in the IPL 2025 Eliminator against Gujarat Titans.

Under Simone Inzaghi, Inter Milan have staged what has been an incredibly dramatic run to the UEFA Champions League final. Separating them from a fourth title in Europe's premier club competition is Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) who are on the hunt for their first-ever crown. Inter booked their place in the title clash after a dramatic extra-time win over Barcelona, but their recent form has taken a massive hit.Days before taking on Barcelona, Inter were still in the running for a historic treble. The Italians were in contention for the Serie A and the Coppa Italia titles. Fast forward a month, and the Nerazzurri missed out on both. They were thrashed by city rivals AC Milan in the Coppa Italia and finished one point adrift of Napoli in the league.Yet, if Inter win the Champions League, it would be considered a successful campaign. Their run has been built on individual brilliance, unrelenting team spirit and Inzaghi's managerial brilliance.Yann Sommer and his defenders have been one of the most rock solid defences in Europe this year. The side only let in one goal in the eight-game league phase. The number, though, rose to 10 in the knockouts, it is still the fewest goals conceded this season in the Champions League.The 36-year-old Sommer has been a masterstroke for Inter this season. While the Swiss keeper has been part of the club since 2023, his performances between the sticks have been nothing short of a lifesaver, particularly this season. The semi-final against Barcelona saw him make a staggering 14 saves, most of which came in the second leg, as the former Bayern Munich man parried incessant attempts from Lamine Yamal & Co.Brought in for €6 million from Bayern Munich, Sommer was signed as a replacement for André Onana, who departed for Manchester United in a €55 million deal — over nine times the fee.Ahead of the final, Sommer named his save against Yamal as one of the “two great moments” of his career, the other being Switzerland’s memorable Euro 2021 campaign.Now, as Inter prepare to face PSG in the Champions League final, Sommer believes this could finally be the night his team lifts the coveted trophy for the first time since 2010.At 36, and having already retired from international football, the Swiss goalkeeper knows he’s nearing the end of the road. “This is a nice way to end my career,” Sommer said, reflecting on his place in the final, set to be played at the Allianz Arena on May 31.Will Inter salvage a season that unraveled in its final stages with a Champions League title?

Champions League Final: Can Ousmane Dembele do for PSG what Kylian Mbappe couldn’t?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/top-stories/champions-league-final-can-ousmane-dembele-do-for-psg-what-kylian-mbappe-couldnt/articleshow/121534293.cms,"Dembele will play in the UCL Final for the first time in his career on Saturday (Image via X/@PSG_English & HasKM7WonTheUCL)

Poll Will PSG finally win their first Champions League title this season? Yes, they will triumph! No, they will fall short again.

Sai Sudharsan: 'County stints reminded me that basics are most important part of batting'





Almost a year has passed since Kylian Mbappe left Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) for Real Madrid. The Frenchman leaving PSG without a Champions League title remains an unfulfilled dream, both for the player and the club. PSG haven’t won the Champions League in their 54-year existence but are just one win away from changing that.In the UEFA Champions League final set to be played at the Munich Arena on Saturday, the Parisiens will have yet another shot at European glory as they take on Inter Milan.Luis Enrique’s post-Mbappe PSG squad hasn’t been constructed around stars, rather a well-oiled unit that has been delivering on all fronts. While the team does not rely on one individual to lead the lines, a Frenchman in their ranks has often been the point of difference. Ousmane Dembele , in his second season at the club, has been an indispensable part of the setup. As they challenge for European silverware, the former Barcelona and Borussia Dortmund winger knows the summit clash carries a deeper personal significance.In his 10 seasons as a professional, Dembele has played in the Champions League in nine of them. While he’s no stranger to starry nights, he will play his first-ever final on Saturday, and could possibly make it his, and his team’s, first continental triumph.Under Enrique, the 28-year-old has developed into being more than a traditional winger.Throughout the campaign, the No. 10 has been given the freedom to roam the pitch, create chaos in midfield and orchestrate chances. His redefined role has paid dividends: 8 of his 20 Champions League goals have come this season. His goal in the first leg of the semi-final against Arsenal remains one of the most important moments in PSG’s road to the final.The France international has 32 goals in all competitions this season, including joint-best 21 in Ligue 1. But it’s not just about the goals — it’s about how he’s scoring them. Since being repositioned as PSG’s primary attacking outlet, his shot conversion rate has gone from 13.5% to 26.7%.“We always try to give our all, especially as we have the ambition here at Paris Saint-Germain to win this trophy for the first time”, said the winger-turned-striker on the final. His transformation is nearly complete. A Champions League triumph would mark the culmination of his journey — from an inconsistent, injury-prone winger to a confident, clinical goalscorer.As PSG stand on the verge of European glory, only for the second time, can the once injury-prone, inconsistent and question-marked winger do what Lionel Messi, Neymar Jr., Mbappe, Zlatan Ibrahimovic and a long line of stars couldn’t? Only time will tell.","Paris Saint-Germain take on Inter Milan in the UEFA Champions League final on Saturday. Ousmane Dembele will play in his first-ever final for the French club.

French giants Paris Saint-Germain have been quite impressive in the Champions League 2024/25 season, making their presence felt especially in the knockouts. The Luis Enrique-led side overcame early jitters in the league stage to mount a comeback when it mattered the most. PSG will face Inter Milan in the tournament's final, marking the first match in the competition's history between the sides.Here's a look at PSG's route to the Champions League 2024/25 final:The Luis Enrique-led side struggled to get the job done in their opening match, with the strikers especially unable to convert chances. PSG were lucky to get a win following an error by Girona goalkeeper Paulo Gazzaniga in added time. Gazzaniga failed to stop a low shot by full-back Nuno Mendes, gifting the French side three points.PSG suffered their maiden loss in the ongoing Champions League season, following a sloppy display against Arsenal. Kai Havertz and Bakayo Saka scored in the 20th and 35th minutes, handing Arsenal an early lead which eventually proved enough. Enrique admitted that his side lost almost every single duel.The French side failed to get back to winning ways in their next Champions League match, recording a 1-1 draw against the Netherlands side.Achraf Hakimi scored the equaliser in the 55th minute following Noa Lang's goal in the 34th minute. ""We created plenty of chances but the ball just didn’t want to go in,"" said Hakimi summing up PSG's dismal luck.PSG suffered a 1-2 loss against Spanish side Atletico Madrid, further extending their winless run. PSG's Warren Zaïre-Emery scored the opener in the 14th minute, handing his team an early lead. However, Nahuel Molina and Angel Correa took advantage of some lacklustre defending to help their side pull off a comeback win.Bayern Munich recorded a 1-0 win against the French side, relegating PSG to their second consecutive loss. Bayern defender Minjae Kim scored the winner in the 38th minute. A red card for PSG attacker Ousmane Dembele certainly didn't help matters as Bayern held on to pull off a vital win.Goncalo Ramos, Nuno Mendes and Désiré Doué stepped up to help PSG get back to winning ways, scoring in the 30th, 72nd and 85th minutes. Ramos delivered after being signed for a hefty sum, making his presence felt. ""It was very important for us to win the match, to get the three points,"" said Enrique.The winning run continued for the French giants as they pulled off a prolific triumph against City. Jack Grealish and Erling Haaland handed the English side a strong lead by scoring in the 50th and 53rd minutes. However, Dembele, Bradley Barcola, Joao Neves and Ramos scored in quick succession to help their side record an important win.Dembele scored the first hat-trick for PSG in the ongoing Champions League season, helping his team dominate following an early goal by Barcola. The win proved crucial as the French side soared into the knockouts.The French side pulled off a 10-0 win on aggregate over two legs, pulling off a 3-0 win in the first leg with a 7-0 triumph in the second match. There were seven different goal scorers for PSG in the second leg, showcasing the variety in attack. Dembele scored a brace in the first leg.PSG faced their first real test in the knockouts, recording a 0-1 defeat in the first leg. However, Dembele stepped up with an early goal in the second match, resulting in a penalty shootout following PSG's 1-0 win. Goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma emerged as the hero for PSG, saving two penalties. Vitinha, Ramos, Dembele and Doue converted the penalties astutely, helping their side sail through.The French side overcame a late scare in the second leg to record a 5-4 win on aggregate. While PSG pulled off a 3-1 win in the first leg, Aston Villa made their presence felt in the following encounter with a fighting 3-2 victory. The PSG defenders held on despite Villa trailing by only one goal in the 57th minute of the second leg, ensuring a smooth pathway to the semi-final.While the quarter-final against Villa certainly got a bit nervy, PSG dominated proceedings in the semi-final with a 3-1 aggregate win. While Dembele's early goal proved enough in the first leg, Fabian Ruiz and Hakimi drove home the advantage in the second match. Saka's late goal proved insufficient as PSG made amends for their earlier league loss against Arsenal, sailing into the final.","Paris Saint-Germain will face Inter Milan in the Champions League 2024/25 final.

Inter coach Simone Inzaghi expressed confidence ahead of Saturday's Champions League final against Paris Saint-Germain in Munich, drawing inspiration from his team's impressive journey to the final. The Italian side aims to secure their fourth Champions League title, following previous victories in 1964, 1965, and 2010.Inter's Champions League campaign began with a goalless draw against Manchester City in September, a rematch of the 2023 final in Istanbul. The team finished fourth in the 36-team league phase with only one loss and as many goals conceded in eight matches.""It is always hugely exciting before every Champions League match, and especially when it is the final. We fully deserve to be here because we have shown huge desire right from our very first match in Manchester,"" Inzaghi told reporters at the Allianz Arena.The Nerazzurri demonstrated their strength by defeating Feyenoord in the last 16, followed by victories over giants Bayern Munich in the quarter-finals and Barcelona in the semi-finals.""These have been great opponents, so our place here is merited even though we know we still have to take the last step, which is the most important one,"" added Inzaghi, who deflected questions about his future amid departure speculation.Seven players from Inter's 2023 final line-up against City are expected to start against PSG. ""Every game is different, and finals can be decided by key moments,"" Inzaghi said regarding the match against the wealthy French club. ""Two years ago we were not the favourites but we went toe to toe with City on the pitch and maybe we could have deserved more.""Inter faces the challenge of recovering from their recent Serie A title loss to Napoli. ""The mental side of the game is important. The players have worked very hard and of course we have put that domestic disappointment to one side,"" Inzaghi stated, confirming he has a full squad available.""The players are all available and so it comes down to me to select my team. The players must not be obsessed, but they need to have the right degree of determination,"" said the manager.While Inter desperately need to conclude what has been a rather disappointing end to the season with the results in Serie A by claiming the trophy, PSG is on the hunt for its first-ever triumph in the competition.","Inter coach Simone Inzaghi confident ahead of Saturday's Champions League final against PSG in Munich.

DS Penske drivers react to double win in Formula E Round 10 in Shanghai





DS Penske driver Maximilian Gunther won the first race of the Shanghai E-Prix on Saturday, clinching his second victory of the season after his win in Part 1 of the Jeddah E-Prix. He now sits fifth in the 2025 Formula E Driver Standings with 71 points. Just behind him is his teammate Jean-Eric Vergne, who secured his first podium of the season by finishing second. Vergne started from tenth on the grid to join pole-winner Gunther on the podium.Sharing his picture with the trophy on Instagram, Maximilian Gunther wrote after his win at the Shanghai E-Prix: “YEEESS!!! Pole. Win. P1-P2 win as a team. Couldn’t be happier! Huge congrats to @jeanericvergne on second place and big thanks to @ds_penske_fe @dsperformance for the amazing car and strategy today.”Gunther had said in a previous Instagram post that he was ready to give everything in the race after securing pole position in the qualifying round. After the win, he said, “Amazing! A 1-2 for the team, I’m so happy. A real masterclass this race, I think the strategy, the pace, the execution, the moves – everything was nice. I knew when I put the overlap on Oli [Rowland] and had more energy, I just had to go and get my head down and try to be secure, which we managed.I’m extremely happy. It means a lot, especially after these last few weeks when momentum was not on our side. This weekend we certainly got it back! It’s been a lot of hard work and I’m very happy for the team.”Jean-Eric Vergne delivered an impressive performance by reaching the podium despite starting deep in the pack. However, he sustained an injury following a collision on his way to the finish line.Talking about the race and his strategy, Vergne said: “What a race! It’s been a rollercoaster. I left a little bit of my front wing in the last corner, I think a bit of my wrist as well – I was suffering the whole race, I really hurt it. Honestly I don’t know, I just went for it – I think we did the right call keeping the Attack Mode quite late. Everybody was attacking a lot and I thought that since everyone was doing that I should save a bit more energy and try to use it towards the end, and it paid off quite nicely. ”Also Read: Shanghai E-Prix 2025: DS celebrates double victory as Maximilian Gunther takes first, Jean-Eric Vergne second in Round 10, Taylor Barnard claims third The Formula E drivers now prepare for the second race of the Shanghai E-Prix.

World number one Aryna Sabalenka may be a three-time Grand Slam winner but the Belarusian revealed Friday how she had been berated and told she would not succeed by coaches as a youngster.On Friday, top-seeded Sabalenka eased into the French Open last 16 with a 6-2, 6-3 win over Serbia's Olga Danilovic on Court Philippe Chatrier.The 27-year-old Miami-based played spoke of the cultural difference of the coaching system in Eastern Europe. ""I've always been quite motivated and they didn't have to push me,"" Sabalenka said. ""But I have heard a lot saying I'm not smart enough, that I'm stupid, and I'll never make it, and I don't have anything to make it to the top. I guess I want to send a quick message to them to quit their job, because honestly, I think they know nothing and they better quit just to save other players,"" said the player.The Minsk native won back-to-back Australian Open titles in 2023 and 2024 and the US Open last year.She brushed aside 34th-ranked Danilovic in 79 minutes and next plays 16th-seeded American Amanda Anisimova for a place in the quarter-finals at Roland Garros.The Belarusian said she felt lucky with her coaching team.""Off court it is important to surround yourself with the right people and have fun with your crew and that's what I'm doing,"" she said. ""I am really grateful to have all of them on my team, we are like family. When I am on court, I am a completely different person, very focused, very aggressive. On the court it is about dreams and I give my all on court.""Madrid Open winner Sabalenka has spoken this week of how ""the environment and in the history of European countries, we are much tougher"".""I definitely think that the environment we have in our countries, which is like very tough and coaches are very brutal, you know, there is nothing nice about the way they work with their players, they (are) quite rude. I think that's why maybe our mentality is much stronger, but also, the same time, they kind of like broke so many players because of that aggressive mindset. I think in Europe and the States, the environment is much healthier. ""In Paris, Sabalenka refuses to consider herself a favourite in a tournament where she has never advanced past the semi-finals. ""Let's just leave it (the pressure) on Iga (Swiatek) since she won it, what, three times in a row, really, right? Let's just... I will just leave it for her.""Amanda Anisimova leads Sabalenka 5-2 in previous meetings. The American is competing in her seventh French Open, having an impressive run to the semi-finals six years ago. She beat Sabalenka in straight sets in the second round in 2019.""When I first got here, I was getting some flashbacks and good memories,"" said the American who got past 22nd-seeded Dane Clara Tauson 7-6 (7/4), 6-4 in the third round.""Obviously (she's) one of the best right now.

Paris: India’s Yuki Bhambri and American Robert Galloway weathered an up-and-down opening set before pulling through in two-hours and 32-minutes with a 6-7 (4), 7-6 (4), 6-3 upset win over the seventh seeds Croatia’s Nikola Mektic and Kiwi Michael Venus in the French Open men’s doubles second round.Bhambri and Galloway, both 32, and ranked 41 and 38, started well, jumping to a 3-0 lead and extending it to 4-2 before the seeded combine hit back with some sharp tennis. In the second set tie-break, Mektic and Venus led 3-1, and at 4-3 were just three points from wrapping up the match, but Bhambri and Galloway won six of the next seven points to level set scores.In the decider the Indo-American pairing broke early to take a 3-0 lead and didn’t look back. “The first set in particular was up-and-down, we went ahead and couldn’t sustain it, but that happens on a clay court. It is difficult to consistently hold serve,” he said, adding, “the second set was more consistent, both teams held serve and we did well in the tie-break.”Bhambri, who played alongside Frenchman Albano Olivetti at Roland Garros last year, falling in the first hurdle, has taken some significant strides in his game this year, which includes making the third round here for the first time.Next up for Bhambri and Galloway are the ninth-seeded Americans Christian Harrison and Evan King, a tricky righty-lefty combination.“Another team with a standout season,” Bhambri said of the Harrison-King partnership that started the year with individual rankings around the 80 mark, but have since climbed to 21 and 18. “It (third round) is going to be a tough match, but it’s definitely winnable.”","Yuki Bhambri and Robert Galloway beat seventh seeds Nikola Mektic and Michael Venus in French Open men's doubles second round.

Paris: The clock on Court Philippe Chatrier was closing in on two hours and 40 minutes. Holger Rune, the tenth seed, was serving to stay in the French Open third-round clash against home hope Quentin Halys. The near full-house waded into the 10th game of the fourth set, exercising their vocal cords when the 28-year-old Halys won the third point of the game (15-30), putting him within two points of victory. But the 22-year-old Rune squared his shoulders and looked up into the blue sky before he thundered down a 207 kmph ace to silence the fandom.The Dane won nine of the last eleven games to score a 4-6, 6-2, 5-7, 7-5, 6-2 win in three hours and 20 minutes to move into the fourth round. Rune’s control on the court reflected in the stats — he clocked 66 winners and won 72 per cent of points at the net.The Dane, born in Gentofte in the northern suburb of Copenhagen, is playing his fourth Roland Garros and has compiled a consistent run on the red clay, having made the fourth round or better in every outing. Next up for the world No. 10 is the eighth-seeded Italian Lorenzo Musetti, whom he leads 2-0 in head-to-head clashes.“It was a brutal match. He played really well. Massive respect to him. He really put on a fight,” Rune said in his on-court interview, having survived the Frenchman, home fans, and the change in weather with the sun out in all its glory on Friday. “I tried to change some things. First set did not go how I wanted it to. I had to put more spin on the ball because of the (weather) conditions. The player who took the opportunity to be aggressive was the player who won today. ”In keeping with the trend of the week, where crowd behaviour has been the talking point, Rune asked for a fan to be evicted from Chatrier in the later stages of the third set.“I put my towel down in the box and the guy was yelling aggressively at me. He reached out for me,” said Rune, who seemed to be in an exchange with the fan seated in the front row. “I thought this was very strange, because I did not do anything against him and he should not interact with a player on the court — it’s a bit embarrassing.”Rune complained to the supervisor, saying the fan made him uncomfortable and that he’d rather the man wasn’t in the stands. “They said they’d check the video and if it was true, they would get him away. I guess they checked and I didn’t see him for the rest of the match,” the Dane said.World No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka had problems adjusting to the weather in her third-round encounter against Serbian Olga Danilovic, playing in vastly different conditions than she did her second-round match two days ago. Sabalenka won 6-2, 6-3 in 81 minutes. She next plays 23-year-old Amanda Anisimova in the fourth round — the American leads their head-to-head 5-2.","Denmark's Holger Rune beats France's Quentin Halys in three hours and 20 minutes.

THE TIMES OF INDIA AT ROLAND GARROS:

The Philippe Chatrier Court has been half-full for most of the day sessions this week, not on Thursday though. For Richard Gasquet, a former top-10 player, and the owner of an elegant single-handed backhand, it was a full house for his last outing.The Frenchman was up against the world No. 1 Jannik Sinner. Both men were given standing ovations when they walked into the stadium. No sooner had play started and the roar on Chatrier echoed across the grounds with chants of ‘Reeshard’ clap, clap, clap; ‘Reeshard’ clap, clap, clap filling the late afternoon air.When Gasquet produced two backhand winners, down-the-line, catching Sinner out of position in the first of the veteran’s service games, it raised visions. The Italian was having none of that though as he powered to a 6-3, 6-0, 6-4 second-round win in shade under two-hours.Gasquet, who played in the era of the big three – Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic – made three Grand Slam semifinals, twice at Wimbledon and once in New York, suffered a calf injury in the lead up to his farewell tournament.Sinner, 23, took his time settling down on the clay, having played his first-round match under lights in vastly different conditions. “In the evening, the ball bounces less. It can play a bit more flatter, because the ball doesn’t pop up like it did today,” he said. “Today, it was at times a bit cloudy, at times was sunny. Different conditions.”Sinner, who had some support in the stands, applauded the home crowd, saying they were respectful. “When you play against French players here, it’s a little bit different, the atmosphere. It’s the same when I play in Italy,” he said.","France's Richard Gasquet beat Italy's Jannik Sinner in straight sets.

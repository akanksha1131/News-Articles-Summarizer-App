Poll How many players do you think most teams will opt to retain? 5 Players 4 Players 3 Players

NEW DELHI: The Women’s Premier League (WPL) has announced key guidelines for the upcoming mega auction, allowing teams to retain up to five players ahead of the high-profile event. The retention deadline is set for November 5, while the auction window will be between November 25 to 29, as communicated to franchises on Thursday.Each team can retain a maximum of three capped Indian players, two overseas players, and two uncapped Indian players. If a franchise chooses to retain all five players, at least one must be an uncapped Indian. This rule ensures a balance between experienced stars and emerging talent in the squads.For the first time in WPL history, franchises can use the Right-to-Match (RTM) option, allowing them to buy back players from their 2025 squads. Each team is entitled to five RTMs, though the number varies depending on retention. Teams retaining all five players lose the RTM option, while those retaining fewer players get more RTMs — four for one retention, three for two, two for three, and one for four.The league has set an auction purse of Rs 15 crore per team. Standard retention prices have been outlined across five slabs: Rs 3.5 crore for Player 1, Rs 2.5 crore for Player 2, Rs 1.75 crore for Player 3, Rs 1 crore for Player 4, and Rs 50 lakh for Player 5.Deductions from the auction purse are proportional to the number of retained players, with Rs 9.25 crore deducted for five retentions. Negotiations between franchises and players can alter these amounts, with uncapped Indians carrying a minimum retention value of Rs 50 lakh.The WPL has also set a clear timeline leading up to the auction: player retention lists are due by November 5, auction entry lists by November 7, the final player registration by November 18, and the official auction list will be released on November 20. These measures aim to ensure transparency and maintain competitive balance as the WPL gears up for another thrilling season.","The Women’s Premier League (WPL) has announced key guidelines for the upcoming mega auction.

Indian opener Smriti Mandhana is approaching a significant milestone in women's ODI cricket as she needs just 12 runs to surpass Australian legend Belinda Clark's record for most runs in a calendar year when India face South Africa in the ICC Women's World Cup match on Thursday.India enter the match undefeated after victories against Sri Lanka and Pakistan, while South Africa recently rebounded with a win against New Zealand following their 10-wicket loss to England.Mandhana has had a modest start to the tournament with scores of 8 and 23 against Sri Lanka and Pakistan, respectively.

NEW DELHI: India’s wicketkeeper-batter Richa Ghosh etched her name in the record books on Thursday, smashing the highest-ever score by a batter at No.8 or lower in Women’s ODI history with a blistering 94 off 77 balls against South Africa in the ICC Women’s World Cup at the ACA-VDCA Cricket Stadium in Visakhapatnam.Ghosh’s whirlwind innings, laced with 11 fours and four sixes, rescued India from a precarious 102 for six to a competitive total of 251. She surpassed the previous record of 74 held by South Africa’s Chloe Tryon, set earlier this year against Sri Lanka.Remarkably, this match also created another piece of history — it was the first-ever Women’s ODI where both teams’ No.8 (or lower) batters scored fifties. South Africa’s Nadine de Klerk smashed a match-winning 84 not out off 54 balls, also eclipsing Tryon’s earlier mark.Despite Ghosh’s heroics, India succumbed to a three-wicket defeat, marking South Africa’s first win over India after five straight losses and their third consecutive World Cup victory against the Women in Blue Earlier, India got off to a promising start as Pratika Rawal (37) and Smriti Mandhana (23) added 55 runs in 10.2 overs, but the collapse that followed saw five wickets tumble for just 19 runs. From 83 for one, India slumped to 102 for six, with Harmanpreet Kaur , Jemimah Rodrigues, and Deepti Sharma failing to settle.Ghosh then took charge, rebuilding with Amanjot Kaur (13) and later Sneh Rana (33). Her 51-run partnership with Amanjot and 88-run stand with Rana for the eighth wicket lifted India to respectability. She reached her fifty in 53 balls and unleashed a late assault, plundering 44 runs in her final 24 deliveries before falling in the last over.While the match ended in heartbreak for India, Richa Ghosh’s record-breaking knock shone bright — a powerful reminder of her immense potential and fearless approach on the world stage.","Richa Ghosh smashed the highest-ever score by a batter at No.8 or lower in Women's ODI history with a blistering 94 off 77 balls against South Africa in the ICC Women's World Cup.

Riding on Nadine de Klerk 's blistering 54-ball 84, South Africa defeated India by three wickets in their Women’s World Cup clash in Visakhapatnam on Thursday.It was the first real nail-biter of this World Cup, and India ended up on the wrong side. There was elation and jubilation in the South African camp, while the Indian players were left distraught. Despite a hard fight, de Klerk’s special knock snatched the game away.Chasing 252, South Africa’s innings was bolstered by skipper Laura Wolvaardt ’s 70, Chloe Tryon’s 49, and de Klerk’s match-winning blitz, featuring five sixes and eight fours from 54 balls.

Poll Who do you think will win the upcoming match between Bangladesh and New Zealand? Bangladesh New Zealand

Going down to England in their last game after giving the four-time champions a real scare, Bangladesh will be eager to come back to winning ways when they face New Zealand in their third game of the ICC Women’s ODI World Cup in Guwahati on Friday.Opening their campaign with a comprehensive seven-wicket victory over Pakistan, the Nigar Sultana-led Bengal Tigresses had England in a soup before Heather Knight bailed the former champions out with a four-wicket win chasing 179. Despite losing against England, in both the matches, Bangladesh bowlers – especially the spinners – have been the backbone of their fine performance so far. However, their batting has remained a concern.So, playing their second match at Barsapara Cricket Stadium, Bangladesh will bank on their bowlers to come good again on a track which has aided spinners in the three matches at the venue till now. And to register their second win in three outings, Bangladesh will be up against a side who are yet to open their account.Champions of the 2000 edition, the White Ferns have suffered back-to-back losses and have their backs to the wall.Languishing at the seventh spot on the eight-team roster, the Kiwis will be hoping to turn things around sooner than later if they are to avoid an early exit from the marquee event.Led by vice-captain and left-arm spinner Nahida Akter , Bangladesh tweakers have troubled the opponent batters. Bangladesh’s leading wicket-taker across formats, Nahida will be pivotal to the Asian side’s scheme of things. And she will get support from leg-spinners troika of Fahima Khatun, Rabeya Khan and 18-year-old Shorna Akter.Pacer Marufa Akter is expected to continue her impressive work with the new ball and her knack of generating pace is likely to test the struggling New Zealand opener Suzie Bates who has returned consecutive ducks in this edition. Captain Sophie Devine has led from the front with scores of 112 (vs Australia) and 85 (vs South Africa), but none of the other batters have converted their starts to big knocks.New Zealand will look to exploit Bangladesh’s unsettled and inexperienced batting to break their losing streak and move up the ladder.",Bangladesh face New Zealand in their third game of the ICC Women's ODI World Cup in Guwahati on Friday.

Poll Will MS Dhoni play IPL 2026? Yes No, he will retire

Madurai turned into a sea of MS Dhoni supporters on Thursday as the former Chennai Super Kings and ex-India captain arrived to inaugurate the newly built Velammal Cricket Stadium, an international-standard facility developed by the Velammal Educational Trust in collaboration with the Tamil Nadu Cricket Association (TNCA).Hundreds of fans packed the Madurai airport and later the stadium, chanting “Dhoni, Dhoni” as the legend made his entry wearing his trademark sunglasses and casual attire. Videos of the 44-year-old waving at supporters and greeting crowds quickly went viral on social media.The newly inaugurated stadium, built at a cost of ₹325 crore and spread across 11.5 acres, currently seats 7,300 spectators and will eventually expand to 20,000. The venue includes a Centre of Excellence, practice nets, advanced drainage facilities, and floodlights — setting it up to host TNPL, Ranji Trophy, and even IPL matches in the future.But the biggest moment of the day came when Dhoni picked up the bat and walked to the crease for a few hits during the event. The crowd erupted instantly, the decibel levels rising as he began to play a few trademark strokes to the delight of thousands in attendance.As the cameras followed him onto the field, a touching moment stood out, and it melted hearts online. A young fan approached Dhoni just as he was about to bat. In a spontaneous gesture, the boy bent down to touch the former India captain’s feet as a mark of respect.Dhoni’s reaction won everyone over. He immediately extended his hand for a handshake, patiently waited for the boy to finish, then offered a firm handshake and gently patted him on the helmet - a moment that captured the humility and grace for which he is loved by many.The short exchange between the legend and the young admirer soon flooded social media, symbolising the bond between Dhoni and his fans, which remains as strong as ever.",MS Dhoni was in Madurai to inaugurate the Velammal Cricket Stadium.

Poll Do you agree with the selection of Nitish Rana in the Ranji Trophy squad? Yes, he's an experienced player No, he didn’t perform well in UP Uncertain, need more context

The Delhi and District Cricket Association (DDCA) has picked its squad for the upcoming Ranji Trophy and, while the list isn’t official yet, it is understood that the state cricket body is set to announce a jumbo 25-member contingent for the first two games. Delhi will open their Ranji Trophy 2025-26 campaign in an away match against Hyderabad from October 15, and then will play their first home match at the Arun Jaitely Stadium against Himachal Pradesh from October 25.In the senior selection committee meeting held on Thursday, Ayush Badoni was given the captaincy nod, with Yash Dhull named as his deputy for the first two fixtures. Rishabh Pant has also been included and will lead the side once he gets clearance from the BCCI medical team. Interestingly, the selection panel of Yashpal Singh, KP Bhaskar, Manu Nayyar has picked as many as four wicketkeepers for the two fixtures.It is worth noting that the squad selection was such a rushed exercise that the pool of probables didn't even play the practice games or have any match simulation.There were just normal nets and selections were done on the basis of that. The prime reason for the matches not happening was DDCA's delay in finalising he the list of support staff for the upcoming season.After a lot of deliberation and infighting amongst some former and current office bearers, a jumbo list was released but it happened only on September 27 - just a couple of weeks before the senior squads were supposed to be finalised and days before men's U-19 and women's T20 teams were to be selected.The list raised a lot of questions as Kshitiz Sharma, who was playing for Delhi till last year, was appointed the batting coach for Ranji Trophy. Sharma has played only a handful of games for Delhi and pipped the likes of former India A cricketer and domestic stalwart Robin Bisht, who had to settle for a role with the U-19 team. There were a lot of issues in U-19 team selection too and intervention of senior office bearers restored order before the team left for the away assignment.As far as the Ranji Trophy squad is concerned, Nitish Rana, who moved base back to Delhi this year, has been surprisingly picked in the Badoni-led squad.Before moving to Uttar Pradesh, Rana wasn't considered for red-ball cricket by the then Delhi selectors and the southpaw couldn't get going as a professional in UP too. When questioned on his selection, DDCA secretary Ashok Sharma said he scored runs in state's T20 league - DPL. It well could have been the first time that a selection for four-day cricket was done on the basis of a T20 tournament.""Nitish Rana is an experienced player and he scored runs in the DPL,"" said Sharma.When asked about picking more than 20 players, Sharma maintained that the extras were mere backups but confirmed that they will travel with the team. As per the BCCI guidelines, only 15 are accommodated on the ground on match days and rest are asked to stay back in the hotel. This has been an age-old practice at the DDCA where they continue to pick big squads and a large contingent travels even for one away game.""They are backup players. But as per BCCI guidelines they will not go to the ground. They will stay back in the team hotel but will continue getting the Daily Allowance which the rest of the players get,"" added Sharma.Delhi has been struggling in the domestic circuit and are yet to put up a noteworthy performance in the last few years. The selection of teams continues to be a messy affair and the internal conflicts have never allowed cricket to take a front-seat. The current and former office bearers have continued to defy BCCI guidelines and even after a scathing email from President Rohan Jaitley in 2023, nothing has changed in the cricket body.Even this year's first selection meet was a turbulent affair as one group of office bearers wanted Secretary Sharma out of the selection meeting room. The first meeting of the season was postponed a lot of emails later, Sharma continued to attend the meetings which followed. He was in the room today also with joint secretary Amit Grover when the Ranji squad was picked.The DDCA will upload the squad soon and there could well be last minute modifications.","The Delhi and District Cricket Association (DDCA) has picked its squad for the upcoming Ranji Trophy.

Poll Do you believe Kranti Gaud will continue to rise as a key player for India in future matches? Yes, definitely! No, she will struggle.

Kranti Gaud pulled off a moment of brilliance to give India a flying start against South Africa in the ongoing Women's World Cup match in Visakhapatnam After scoring a century in the previous match, Tazmin Brits departed for a duck.It was a length ball from Kranti Gaud, just outside the off stump. Tazmin Brits charged down to drive it hard but failed to keep it down.In her follow-through, Kranti thrust out her left hand and took a stunning reflex catch. She fell flat on the ground, clutching the ball, as her teammates rushed in to celebrate.Since bursting onto the international scene less than five months ago, Kranti Gaud has swiftly evolved into India’s go-to new-ball weapon.Earlier, Richa Ghosh made a vibrant 94 after another top-order malfunction as India recovered to post a competitive 251 against South Africa in the Women’s World Cup match on Thursday.Ghosh’s 77-ball innings (11x4, 4x6) showed her teammates how to make use of a rather easy-paced pitch with her seventh ODI fifty.In a high-stakes Women’s World Cup clash against Pakistan on Sunday, Kranti Gaud underlined her growing importance to the team, returning excellent figures of 3 for 20 in 10 overs, including three maidens, to derail Pakistan’s chase of 247.Her performance set up an emphatic 88-run victory and earned Gaud her first Player-of-the-Match award at the very venue where she made her national debut in May this year.For Gaud, it’s been a dream start. Hailing from Ghuwara, a town in Bundelkhand, Madhya Pradesh, she has risen through the ranks with quiet determination.Just last year, she was a net bowler for Mumbai Indians in the Women’s Premier League.The UP Warriorz then snapped her up for a base price of ₹10 lakh at the auction.When injuries to Renuka Thakur and Pooja Vastrakar opened the doors for her in the national setup, Gaud seized the opportunity with both hands.A sensational run in the away series against England, which included a six-wicket haul in the series-deciding third ODI earlier this year, sealed her place in the squad — and since then, she’s only gone from strength to strength.",Kranti Gaud took wicket of South Africa's Tazmin Brits to give India a flying start against South Africa in the ongoing Women's World Cup match in Visakhapatnam.

Algeria secured their place in the 2026 FIFA World Cup on Thursday with a commanding 3-0 victory over Somalia, becoming the fourth African team to qualify after Morocco, Tunisia, and Egypt. The match, played in Oran, saw Wolfsburg striker Mohamed Amoura score twice, while Riyad Mahrez contributed both as scorer and provider.Amoura opened the scoring in just the sixth minute, volleying a precise Mahrez cross into the net. The former Manchester City winger then converted a loose ball in the first half to double the lead. Mahrez once again set up Amoura in the 57th minute, stretching Algeria’s advantage to 3-0. With qualification secured, coach Vladimir Petkovic substituted both scorers to manage the squad ahead of the final round of Group G fixtures.Algeria sit atop Group G with 22 points, four ahead of second-placed Uganda, and will make their fifth World Cup appearance in the United States, Canada, and Mexico next year. Their previous campaigns include first-round exits in 1982, 1986, and 2010, while they reached the second round in 2014 before losing 2-1 to eventual champions Germany.Notably, goalkeeper Luca Zidane, son of French legend Zinedine Zidane, made the squad after switching allegiance from France to Algeria.Elsewhere on the continent, Kenya defeated Burundi 1-0 in a fiery East African derby, with Ryan Ogam scoring the decisive goal. Burundi played almost the entire match with 10 men following a straight red card for Bonfils-Caleb Bimenyimana. The win lifted Kenya to third place in Group F, eight points behind leaders Ivory Coast, who can confirm their fourth World Cup spot with a win in their penultimate fixture.As Africa’s qualification race heats up, nine matches are scheduled Friday, including a crucial Group C round where Benin, South Africa, Nigeria, Rwanda, and Lesotho all remain in contention. With Algeria now guaranteed a place, attention shifts to the remaining spots, ensuring high-stakes drama across the continent’s qualifying groups.","Algeria secured their place in the 2026 FIFA World Cup on Thursday with a commanding 3-0 victory over Somalia.

The coach of Argentine football club Boca Juniors, Miguel Angel Russo, has died at the age of 69, the Argentine Football Association announced Wednesday.Russo's health had deteriorated in recent weeks.The last Boca Juniors game he attended was on September 21, when his team drew 2-2 with Central Cordoba in a league match at Boca's home ground.Boca Juniors never gave details of his health, but Argentine media reported that the coach, diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2017, had contracted a urinary tract infection.Boca Juniors, in a statement, expressed ""profound sadness"" at Russo's death.""Miguel leaves an indelible mark on our club and will always be an example of joy, warmth, and dedication,"" it said.In his absence, his assistant Claudio Ubeda had been managing the club.A man of few words, Russo was a coach for more than half his life and was talked up at one point as a potential manager for the national side after significant stints with Boca Juniors, Rosario Central and Estudiantes de la Plata.He spent his own playing career entirely at Estudiantes, from 1975 to 1988, forming part of one of the most memorable midfields in Argentine football, along with Alejandro Sabella, Marcelo Trobbiani, and Jose Daniel ""Bocha"" Ponce.He made the national team but wasn't selected for the 1986 World Cup in which Diego Maradona famously captained Argentina to victory.Years later, Russo admitted he was angry at being sidelined but said iconic coach Carlos Bilardo explained: ""'The day you become a coach, you'll understand, like never before.' And later, I understood.""Russo's trophy cabinet was not extensive, but he had a knack for reviving the fortunes of top teams.His first first-division title came with Velez Sarsfield in 2005.

Poll Should the match between Italy and Israel be postponed due to political tensions? Yes, safety is a priority No, the game should proceed as planned

Italy’s hopes of automatic qualification for the 2026 World Cup are under pressure, as the national team prepares to face Israel in Udine next Tuesday amid rising political tensions. The match comes at a sensitive time, following a weekend of some of Europe’s largest pro-Palestinian demonstrations across Italy.Hundreds of thousands of people took to the streets to protest Israel’s ongoing military offensive in Gaza, which followed a Hamas attack on Israeli communities on October 7, 2023. Calls to ban Israel from international sport have grown louder, and demonstrators even targeted the Italian team’s training centre in Florence, demanding the qualifier be called off.Only around 4,000 tickets have been sold for the Udine match, a city chosen to minimize potential disorder. Udine previously hosted Israel in September 2024 during the Nations League, a match that passed largely without incident but required heavy security, including soldiers stationed on the stadium roof. Despite these precautions, the mayor of Udine, Alberto Felice De Toni, has requested the game be postponed due to fears of larger protests.Italy coach Gennaro Gattuso described the situation as “very sad”, lamenting the unusual atmosphere for a crucial match.“There will be 10,000 people outside the stadium and 5-6,000 inside it... I would have preferred to play a home match in front of an enthusiastic crowd like we did in Bergamo (where Italy beat Estonia 5-0) a month ago,” he said.Italy sit second in their World Cup qualifying group, level on nine points with Israel but six behind leaders Norway, who hold a 16-goal advantage in goal difference. Only the group winner secures automatic qualification, leaving Italy to realistically aim for a play-off spot. The team has failed to reach the knockout stage of a World Cup since winning it in 2006, and missed out entirely in 2022 despite being reigning European champions.With four remaining matches, including a crucial San Siro clash against Norway, Italy must win all remaining games while hoping for slip-ups from Erling Haaland’s side to top the group. The external political pressure, coupled with the crucial stakes on the field, has made Gattuso’s task more challenging than ever, as Italy fight to keep their World Cup dreams alive.",Italy face Israel in a World Cup qualifier in Udine next Tuesday.

Poll Do you think hosting La Liga matches outside Europe is a positive development for football? Yes, it's a great opportunity for global exposure. No, it undermines the league's traditions.

In a landmark decision, Barcelona will play Villarreal in Miami on December 20, marking the first European league fixture to be held outside Europe, La Liga announced on Wednesday. The match will take place at Florida’s Hard Rock Stadium, originally scheduled to be played at Villarreal’s home ground.La Liga president Javier Tebas called the move a historic step for Spanish football.“With this match we take a historic step that projects La Liga and Spanish football into a new dimension,” Tebas said. “We understand and respect the concerns that this decision may generate, but it is important to put it into context — it is a single match out of the 380 that make up the season.”While the move is groundbreaking, it has faced criticism. UEFA , the European football governing body, earlier expressed opposition to overseas league games but allowed this one on an exceptional basis. Real Madrid, Barcelona’s arch-rivals, also voiced disapproval, warning that playing a La Liga game abroad could “alter the competitive balance” and set an “unacceptable precedent.”Fan reaction has been mixed. In September, 18 supporter groups from both clubs expressed complete opposition to the match being held abroad.To ease concerns, Villarreal has announced measures to compensate season ticket holders.“Season ticket holders will be able to travel for free to the match, and those who choose not to travel to Miami will enjoy a 30 percent discount on their season ticket price as part of the measures designed to reward their support and loyalty,” La Liga said.La Liga has previously attempted to host matches overseas dating back to 2017, but faced resistance from the Spanish football federation (RFEF), despite successfully staging the Spanish Super Cup in Saudi Arabia.The December 20 fixture between Barcelona and Villarreal represents a historic moment for European football, as the league seeks to expand its global reach, despite concerns over tradition, competitive fairness, and fan sentiment.

Poll Which aspect do you think has a bigger impact on team success: talent or teamwork? Talent Teamwork

Former England and Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard has revealed that ego and club rivalries prevented England's talented generation from achieving international success during his playing career. Speaking on the Rio Ferdinand Presents podcast, the 45-year-old, who earned 114 international caps, discussed how internal divisions among players from different Premier League clubs hindered the national team's performance.Gerrard, who led Liverpool to Champions League glory in 2005, was part of England's ""golden generation"" that failed to progress beyond quarter-finals in major tournaments despite having exceptional talent from top clubs.The squad included Manchester United stars Rio Ferdinand, Paul Scholes, and Wayne Rooney , alongside Chelsea players Ashley Cole, John Terry, and Frank Lampard, who all achieved success in Premier League and Champions League.""We were all egotistical losers,"" Gerrard said on the podcast, noting the contrast with the current camaraderie between the same players in their punditry careers. ""So why didn't we connect when we were 20, 21, 22, 23? Was it ego? Was it rivalry?""""It was down to the culture within England. We weren't friendly or connected. We weren't a team. We never at any stage became a real good, strong team.""England continue to seek their first major men's international trophy since the 1966 World Cup, though they reached the finals of the last two European Championships under Gareth Southgate, who recently stepped down after Euro 2024.""Gareth Southgate is underrated for how he connected with the England team,"" Gerrard said. ""Because for me, the talent was there. The players were there. The level of games we were all playing at was there to go and do better than what we did.""""We had a little bit of bad luck with penalties or whatever. We have to take responsibility, but I've got a big frustration when I look back at England that we never did better. I think it's a combination of different things, but one of the big things for me was we weren't a team. We were a group of individuals with talent and it never works like that.""Thomas Tuchel has taken charge of England's World Cup campaign next year following Southgate's departure.Gerrard's own managerial career has faced setbacks after unsuccessful spells at Aston Villa and Saudi Arabian club Al Ettifaq. He is now among the favourites to return to Rangers, where he won the Scottish Premiership in 2020/21.Regarding his managerial future, Gerrard said: ""There's a part of me that still feels that there's a bit of unfinished business in terms of wanting to go in and face another couple of exciting challenges. But I want a certain type of challenge. If in an ideal world they come available, I'll jump at them. If they don't, I won't go back in. I want to be at a team that's going to compete to win because I think that suits me better.

What’s common between the three Formula E world champions

How the three World Champions fared in Formula E Season 11

Days after Oliver Rowland lifted his Formula E World Championship trophy in London this season, an interesting trend has come to the attention of Formula E and its fans. As a coincidence, all Formula E drivers who won the Mexico City E-Prix went on to win the Formula E World Championship that season, and this has been proved right for three consecutive years.Highlighting the same since 2023, a poster of three World Champions was shared on X by Formula E with the caption, “The trend continues. Each winner of the #MexicoCityEPrix from the past three seasons has gone on to become World Champion.”The special poster features 2023 Formula E World Champion Jake Dennis from Andretti, then TAG Heuer Porsche’s Pascal Wehrlein, who won in 2024, and the new World Champion, Nissan driver Oliver Rowland. All three of them won in the Mexico E-Prix and went on to lift the winner’s trophy in the Formula E World Championship that year.Oliver Rowland had strengthened his chances of winning the Formula E World Championship this year much earlier. He was leading the Formula E Driver Standings ever since he won Part 2 of the Jeddah E-Prix, which was his second win of the season after winning the Mexico E-Prix. In the last leg, the Nissan driver got nervous for a while as Pascal Wehrlein, who was following him in the number two position, closed the gap after grabbing quite a few podiums while Rowland had a dull period.Things became serious for Rowland when he failed to finish the Round 13 race in Berlin, while Wehrlein won second spot on the podium. But he eventually managed to confirm his championship in Berlin after four wins and three more podiums.Sharing about his bad race in Berlin, Rowland had said, “I was hoping before the weekend that the outcome could be [the World Championship], but after yesterday (Saturday) and this morning (Sunday), I was more worried that it might never come.”Also Read: Oliver Rowland reacts to daughter’s sweet radio message after Formula E Championship win: “It’s amazing” Things, however, changed for Wehrlein, who was pushed to third position after Nick Cassidy made a late entry in the Formula E Driver Standings by registering three consecutive wins.

Wehrlein registered one win and five more podiums this season.Meanwhile, Andretti driver Jake Dennis finished in seventh position in the Formula E Driver Standings.

Taylor Barnard on losing top three spot in Formula E World Championship

Fans hail Taylor Barnard for his fantastic rookie season

It was Taylor Barnard’s rookie season this year, and the NEOM McLaren driver put up a fantastic performance by temporarily making it to the top three in the Formula E Driver Standings by ousting the much more experienced Porsche driver Antonio Felix Da Costa.

Finishing P4 in the Drivers’ Championship and coming into the final weekend with a shot at runner-up is something to be proud of.”Also adding a note for teammate Sam Bird, as NEOM McLaren withdrew from Formula E after the end of the season, Barnard wrote, “@sambird_official it wasn’t the weekend you deserved either.You’ve been a huge part of my season both on and off the track, and I’m grateful for everything. You deserved more. To all the Papaya fans, thank you for the incredible support in our final race together. You always go above and beyond. ”Reacting to his post, a fan wrote, “An incredible debut season, huge congrats and excited to see where you go next!” Another said, “I know I said it the other day, but you’ve been incredible to watch this last year and a pleasure to support you in Papaya — there are many of us that can’t wait to support you in whatever you do next!” One more commented, “You were incredible all season around, Taylor.

We couldn’t have done it without you all — your trust and support have never been taken for granted,” he added.Praising the two McLaren drivers, he wrote, “Sam clinched McLaren’s first-ever fully electric win at the São Paulo E-Prix in Season 10, pulling off one of Formula E’s all-time great overtakes, before being waved across the line by none other than Emerson Fittipaldi – McLaren's first Formula 1 World Champion. While Taylor has been a rookie sensation in Season 11, securing five Formula E records, including the youngest driver to start a race, the youngest points scorer, the youngest driver to lead a lap, the youngest podium finisher, and the youngest polesitter. ”He ended the letter saying, “Some of us have been together since the day we first launched this team, while others have seamlessly fitted in along the way and flourished within the environment we have cultivated. For many, I am sure that we will cross paths again soon, but whatever the future holds for those here at Bicester, whatever path they choose to follow, I have no doubt that it will be bright.

Oliver Rowland, Norman Nato’s Formula E experience

Nissan drivers Oliver Rowland and Norman Nato continue to spend time together even after the conclusion of Formula E Season 11. The two are currently vacationing at a beach location. Rowland won the Formula E World Championship this year, while Nato kept himself busy with Formula E as well as the Endurance Championship.Oliver Rowland recently shared several glimpses of his holiday with family and friends.

Nato finished among the last with 21 points and had even skipped the Berlin E-Prix to participate in the Endurance Championship.As per FormulaE.com, Rowland had said after his championship win, “Part of me realizes what we’ve achieved, and I’m trying to digest it in a positive way and balance my emotions. From a mental health perspective, I feel a lot lighter, like a weight has come off my shoulders. It’s not something we drivers talk about very often, but the last few days have been a huge release of emotion and energy. It feels great. Even now, when I watch the videos back, I struggle to believe it’s actually done!”Nato had also shared a few pictures of himself and the Nissan team on Instagram after the end of the Formula E season. He had written in an Instagram post after the London E-Prix, “That’s a wrap for Season 11 of @fiaformulae. Top 3 in the Team and Manufacturer Championship.

How do Formula E and ABB work together?

What do ABB and Formula E say about the partnership?

After a successful Season 11, ABB and Formula E have announced that they will continue their partnership in the upcoming season. This gives ABB another opportunity to promote its new brand positioning via the ABB FIA Formula E World Championship, along with technologies that help industries take a cleaner route.Over a period of eight seasons, the partnership with Formula E has provided ABB a platform to showcase how technology can help industries outrun challenges, engage with customers around the world, and implement its own solutions into the series to improve reliability and efficiency. The partnership extension will provide a year-round opportunity for brand-building and activation, communicating ABB and its technology solutions to new global audiences, including Formula E’s international fanbase.ABB and Formula E will also join hands to engage a new generation of fans, collaborating with unexpected influencers and content creators to tell compelling stories that make advanced electrification and automation technologies tangible and exciting.The end of the mid-race car swap, a 150kW increase in power, top speeds that are 43 percent higher, and energy recovery increasing from 15 to 50 percent indicate how far Formula E technology has come to outperform on track.ABB has also built on its technical involvement in the series, supplying the race chargers from Season 9, and introducing its ABB Ability OPTIMAX® energy management software (Season 9) and Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) technology (Season 5) to the sport.ABB Head of Brand Paco Liebrand said, “We are pleased to be continuing our partnership with Formula E which, like ABB, is striving for a leaner and cleaner future. The synergy between the two organizations, combined with the global appeal of the Championship, makes it a great platform to promote our brand positioning.”He further said, “Formula E is increasingly working with content creators, influencers, and celebrities, with initiatives such as the Evo Sessions making an impact through digital channels beyond the racing itself, which is also an essential part of ABB’s new brand strategy. Going forward, we will be enhancing the way we harness the benefits of this collaboration, ensuring the focus is on delivering content and activations that reinforce our new messaging, build familiarity, and tell the ‘Engineered to Outrun’ story. ”Formula E Chief Revenue Officer Tiziana Di Gioia said, “Our renewed partnership with ABB is a testament to the commercial power and benefit of Formula E as a global platform that drives both brand and business growth. ABB, like our wider partnership portfolio, has and continues to see enormous value in collaborating with the fastest-growing motorsport on the planet, with viewership, commercial integration, and brand storytelling continuing to accelerate. Over eight seasons, ABB has moved from brand visibility to brand activation—integrating deeply into the fan experience, the sport’s ecosystem, and our innovation narrative.Also Read: Antonio Felix Da Costa shares happy memories as Porsche wins Formula E Teams and Manufacturers’ World Championships “This next chapter elevates the partnership even further. With ABB’s new positioning, we are co-creating opportunities across content, digital storytelling, and market engagement, transforming a title partnership into a year-round, value-generating relationship. It’s a model of how modern sponsorships should evolve, rooted in purpose and cultural alignment but measured by impact,” she added.Formula E Season 12 will begin with testing in Valencia in October.","ABB and Formula E have announced that they will continue their partnership in the upcoming season.

Reactions to Nick Cassidy’s farewell post

Nick Cassidy penned an emotional farewell note along with some memorable pictures to bid goodbye to Jaguar TCS Racing after bringing down the curtain with three consecutive wins. The Formula E driver won both the races at the London double-header, climbing to the number two position in the Formula E World Championship.

How Jasmine Paolini became the face of Italian women's tennis — one smile and swing at a time,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/top-stories/how-jasmine-paolini-became-the-face-of-italian-womens-tennis-one-smile-and-swing-at-a-time/articleshow/124412811.cms,"Jasmine Paolini of Italy celebrates her win against Yue Yuan of China in the women's singles round of 32 match at the 2025 Wuhan Open. (Getty Images)

WUHAN: Jasmine Paolini’s ringlets are pulled back in a tight top knot that opens out like a crown. Her eyes out sparkle the lights and her laugh is ready. The 29-year-old is joie de vivre on two legs.The Italian enjoyed a breakthrough 2024, up until when she was better known on the doubles court. There may have been a hint of what was to come when she started the season strong, making the fourth round of the Australian Open. Her first time in the second week of a Grand Slam, which took her ranking up to a career-high No.24. In the summer, Paolini made back-to-back major finals at the French Open and Wimbledon and later lodged herself in the top-five at No.4.If what the 5 ft 4’ pro achieved in 2024 was memorable, her effort in making a case for players not in the 5 ft 9 and above height bracket is equally significant. Which is why the back-up season (2025), where she made the fourth round of a Grand Slam just once, yet managed to stay in the top-10 has been revelatory.“I always say that if you keep your level, you are going down. You have to improve, keep improving,” Paolini told TOI on the sidelines of Dongfeng-Voyah Wuhan Open, gesturing with her right hand to make a point.The Italian, ranked No.8 in singles and in the top-five in doubles, is the shortest player in the top-10. American Jessica Pegula at 5 ft 7 is closest to her in height.Marta Kostyuk, the 5 ft 9’ Ukrainian, spoke about how she struggles when standing next to some of the 6-footers on the WTA Tour.“If Marta said that, imagine me,” Paolini said with a laugh. “When I'm playing against them, I see that they are taller than me, but when you come to the net for the coin toss or to shake hands, you see the difference even more. When they are down the other end, you are not thinking about it much.”Paolini, however, has learnt to be kinder to herself.‘Sometimes, when I don’t serve well, I tell myself I'm 163 (cms),” she says, “So compared to people that are 160 in height, I'm serving not that bad.”Paolini points at the robust Italian system –a layered tournament structure and advanced coaching levels -- available to players for her rise in the singles. Italy has eight WTA 125 tournaments, where local players have an opportunity for wildcards into the main draw.Italian tennis is enjoying its best days with Jannik Sinner and Lorenzo Musetti in the top-10 of the ATP Rankings.Any talk of Sinner, hugely popular in Italy, sees Paolini’s eyes light up.She recalls an incident from last year when her former coach Renzo Furlan was in conversation with Sinner. “Jannik told my coach that I was not doing ‘something’ on the court,” she says, breaking into giggles when asked what exactly the world No.2 had suggested she do to improve her game. “I can’t say that then my opponents will know! But when my coach came to me and told me, see Jannik also said, I’m like, if Jannik said…’she finishes throwing back her head and opening out her palms.Paolini said Sinner is seen as a role model among the young in Italy.“He's doing unbelievable things on the court. People like him a lot. How he's behaving on and off the court, he's a really nice guy,” she said. “He’s good role model and that’s very good for our sport in Italy.”For the women it is Paolini who is taking things forward.The 29-year-old says the difference in her life after her success last year is that people recognise her in Italy. She argues that while the two Grand Slam finals were a huge high for her personally, it was the Olympic gold, which she claimed playing alongside Sara Errani, that won her the greatest appreciation among her countrymen.“After the gold medal things were different,” she says, “ People were watching this on the news, the TV. So everybody recognized me. When you do some good results in Grand Slams, it is just tennis fans that are watching. But the gold medal is something all Italians were watching. “This year she emerged triumphant at the Rome Masters, a site she frequented as a child along with her father Ugo.Doubles for Paolini is a play that keeps her in the competition. It helps steady the ship when things are not going her way in singles.“It's a coincidence that I started to play better in singles when I started to play well in doubles,” the Italian said. “Sometimes it's good because you don't play well in singles, but you have the chance to stay in the tournament, it keeps you in the competition.”The last couple of years has been a great balancing act for the little Italian and she has done well to stay on top of things.",Jasmine Paolini is ranked No.8 in singles and in the top-five in doubles. The 29-year-old is the shortest player in the world's top-10. Paolini made back-to- back major finals at the French Open and Wimbledon.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124412721,imgsize-114904,width-400,resizemode-4/2025-wuhan-open-day-5.jpg"

(AP)

'Going to be a battle'

Daniil Medvedev on Wednesday got his revenge against US teenager Learner Tien, beating him in a nail-biter 7-6 (8/6), 6-7 (1/7), 6-4 to proceed to the Shanghai Masters quarter-finals.There he will meet world number seven Alex de Minaur, who cruised past Portugal's Nuno Borges 7-5, 6-2 earlier in the day.Victory in Shanghai comes just over a week after the 36th-ranked Tien took the Russian out of the China Open semi-finals in Beijing.""He's an unbelievable tennis player,"" Medvedev said of the 19-year-old. ""Outside of the big three, he may be the toughest opponent I've ever faced.""Medvedev broke first in the ninth game, but Tien returned the favour immediately.The last two games of the first set saw the two players locked in an epic back-and-forth, their prolonged rallies thrilling the crowd.Both faced breakpoint but managed to hold, with Medvedev smashing a looping lob from Tien to send them to a gripping tiebreak.Medvedev broke early in the second set, but Tien was again unphased -- breaking back in the fifth and then seventh games, before the former world number one levelled in the tenth.Medvedev began limping just before the second-set tiebreak and spoke briefly with a medic before hobbling back onto court.Tien went 3-0 up as the Russian, ten years his senior, tried to stretch out on court, becoming increasingly irate as the match was pushed to a decider.""I should be more calm, but Learner drives me nuts... I lost two very traumatic matches against him -- so for sure I was scared to lose again,"" he said.But a scrappy third set -- full of double-faults from both players -- was settled when Medvedev broke in the ninth game with a backhand.The Russian said he would need to rest his legs in anticipation of a similarly tough challenge against De Minaur on Friday, smiling wryly: ""We're gonna run again"".After Novak Djokovic , the Australian is the highest ranked player left standing after a string of high-profile exits.De Minaur needed five break points in the 11th game against Borges in the first set, converting the last with a backhand for a decisive advantage.He carried the momentum into the second set, breaking in the first and third games.But he remained cautious about his title chances.""In our side of the draw, there's a lot of quality players, so it's still going to be a battle,"" he said.Another top-10 player fell on Wednesday as Italy's Lorenzo Musetti lost to Canada's Felix Auger-Aliassime 6-4, 6-2.Thirteenth-ranked Auger-Aliassime looked sharp throughout, breaking in the fifth game.He went on to dominate the second set, breaking Musetti, the world number nine, in the fifth and seventh games.""I knew it was going to be the toughest match of the week so far, and I knew I was going to have to raise my level, and I did,"" said the 25-year-old Canadian.He will next meet France's Arthur Rinderknech, who reached his first Masters 1000 quarter-final after beating Czech Jiri Lehecka 6-3, 7-6 (7/5).Rinderknech's cousin Valentin Vacherot made it to the last eight on Tuesday, and will face Denmark's Holger Rune for a place in the semi-finals.Djokovic will follow them on to court on Thursday against Belgium's Zizou Bergs for a place in the last four.","Daniil Medvedev beats Learner Tien 7-6, 6-7 (1/7), 6-4 in Shanghai Masters quarter-finals.

WUHAN: Coco Gauff ‘s serve – taken apart and reassembled on television and internet channels -- is the most talked-about shot in tennis.The 21-year-old American, athlete supreme, teamed up with sports performance specialist Gavin MacMillan to retool her serve in the lead-up to the US Open.MacMillan, who worked with the world No.1 Aryna Sabalenka previously, using biomechanics to sort an increasingly errant serve, hasn’t travelled to China with the reigning French Open champion. He’s honouring the prior commitments made before he signed with Gauff.The world No.3, who has double-faulted 426 times in her 65 matches this season, the most in the WTA top-100, believes she’s over the worst in repurposing her serve. She will open her Dongfeng Voyah Wuhan Open campaign this week against Japanese qualifier Moyuka Uchijima on Wednesday in the round of 32.“I’m still obviously learning a new motion, but I felt like Beijing (last week) was a good tournament for me regarding the serve. There were moments I could have served better, but overall, I don’t feel like it was a crutch for me,” said Gauff, who was beaten by the world No.4 Amanda Anisimova in the semi-finals.Gauff, who has dropped speed on her serve to accommodate the new motion, landed 60 percent of her first serves in the match, but won just 10 of 26 of those points. In all she won 16 points on her serve in the match.“Anisimova was returning well,” Gauff said of the all-American semi-final. “The percentage of first serve points (won) was really low, but I hit like a 200-kilometre serve, and she was hitting the ball back way faster. I think I am in the right direction. It is not where I wanted to be, but I definitely feel like it is on the upwards.”“I want my serve to be a real weapon and it is in some moments, but being a weapon more consistently is what I want,” the two-time major winner said.Gauff, who has been open about the fact that her serve needed work, has refrained from commenting on the nuances.To the casual observer it is the ball toss that appears to be the area of concern. It looks like the American draws her left hand closer to her body before releasing the ball, instead of taking it forward. Gauff doesn’t do it all the time, but when the default settings come into play, it is distinct.Czech-born American Martina Navratilova picked on Gauff’s toss during a television interview in New York.“The number one thing for me is the toss, her motion looks good enough to me, ” the 18-time major winner said. “The serve starts with the toss. If she gets that organised, then the rest falls into place because so many times she has had to adjust her motion to where the ball is. It needs to be the other way around.”Gauff, who is using this part of the season to prepare for the 2026 calendar when she hopes her serve and game will be where she wants it to be, is diligent with details.On Monday afternoon in Wuhan, the 5 ft 9’ pro paid a visit to the Robot Innovation Centre, where she engaged in an activity with a humanoid. Gauff was tasked to help the robot pick up plastic fruits and a tennis ball from a table and drop them into a basket, using a remote control.The 21-year-old took her time assimilating with the machine, the one in her hand and the other standing beside her.Picking up the first fruit, an apple took time, after which the match face came on. Gauff clocked 15-20 seconds per fruit there after having found consistency in the controls.""Woohoo,"" she exclaimed after completing the exercise.Dialled in is where Gauff is on the serve. She’s trying, she’s fighting and doing it all while competing.","Coco Gauff has teamed up with sports performance specialist Gavin MacMillan to retool her serve in the lead-up to the US Open.

Adelaide Oval curator Damian Hough is anticipating rain and storms to disrupt the opening day of the second Test between Australia and India in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy A full-house crowd of 53,500 is expected on Friday (December 6) despite the forecast of up to 7mm of rain.

However, the fast bowlers from both sides troubled the batsmen with the new ball.""Shield games, whether it's a red ball or a pink one, we're trying to replicate the Shield and the Test preparation ... very similar preparations,"" Hough said.""The Shield pitch showed if you didn't get a new ball under lights, and you had a couple of set batters in, you're able to see through some night-time cricket.""Hough doesn't think the surface played a role in India's 36-run all out collapse four years ago when they had a 53-run first-innings lead, before losing by eight wickets on day three.""On the morning of day three, no one would have expected that Test match to finish in three days,"" he said.""That was just really good bowling from Australia ...

Pakistan's wrist spinner, Sufiyan Muqeem , led his team to a resounding 10-wicket victory against Zimbabwe in the second T20I at Bulawayo, securing the series win. The match took place on Tuesday.Muqeem's exceptional spell of bowling saw him claim five wickets for just three runs in his four overs. Zimbabwe's innings rapidly unravelled as they were bowled out for a mere 57 runs in 12.4 overs. They had initially started promisingly.The 25-year-old’s remarkable figures are now the best ever recorded by a Pakistan bowler in T20I cricket. He surpassed Umar Gul 's previous record of 5 wickets for 6 runs. Gul achieved this feat twice, against New Zealand and South Africa.This five-wicket haul is Muqeem's first in T20Is, placing him in an exclusive group of Pakistani bowlers alongside Umar Gul and Imad Wasim Pakistan comfortably chased down the target in just 33 balls, reaching 61 without losing any wickets. Openers Saim Ayub (36) and Omair Yousuf (22) made light work of the chase. This victory followed their 57-run win in the first T20I on Sunday.Zimbabwe's opening batsmen, Brian Bennett (21) and Tadiwanashe Marumani (16), provided a solid start, putting on 37 runs for the first wicket in four overs. They were the only Zimbabwean batsmen to reach double figures.The dismissal of both openers within five balls triggered a dramatic collapse, with Zimbabwe losing their remaining wickets for only 20 runs. Muqeem’s devastating spell was the primary cause of this collapse.Marumani was caught by Tayyab Tahir at cover point, while Bennett was dismissed by Irfan Khan at deep square leg at Queens Sports Club.Sikandar Raza, Zimbabwe's experienced all-rounder and often their key batsman, was dismissed for only three runs. Abbas Afridi bowled him, uprooting his off stump.Raza was one of the four Zimbabwean bowlers who struggled to contain Pakistan's opening batsmen, Ayub and Yousuf. The Pakistani openers struck ten boundaries, including a six each, during their short but effective partnership.Ayub's boundary past backward point sealed the comprehensive victory for Pakistan.The third and final T20I between Pakistan and Zimbabwe is scheduled for Thursday.

NEW DELHI: A talented young cricketer, Prithvi Shaw has been facing challenges in his career recently. At the age of 25, he found himself unsold in the IPL auction , with no franchise showing interest in bidding for him, even at a base price of Rs 75 lakh.This situation has raised concerns about his future prospects and the factors contributing to his current predicament.Former England batter Kevin Pietersen , recognizing Shaw's talent, has offered his perspective on the matter.Pietersen believes that Shaw should focus his energies on getting super-fit and, more importantly, distance himself from social media distractions if he wants to regain his previous success.""Some of the greatest sports stories are COMEBACK stories. If Prithvi Shaw has decent people around him who care about his long term success, they'd sit him down, tell him to get off social media & train his absolute backside off in getting super fit. It'll get him back into the correct path where past success can return. Too talented to throw it all away. Love, KP!,"" the former England skipper wrote on 'X'.The issue of Shaw's off-field persona and its potential impact on his on-field performance has been highlighted by former Indian cricketer Mohammad Kaif and others.They suggest that Shaw's activities outside the game may have adversely affected his ability to consistently deliver on the field, leading to unfulfilled potential.Pietersen's advice to Shaw emphasizes the importance of surrounding himself with supportive individuals who genuinely care about his long-term success.He recommends that Shaw should temporarily disengage from social media and dedicate himself wholeheartedly to rigorous training and achieving optimal fitness levels.Pietersen believes that this approach could help Shaw rediscover the path that previously led him to success.Recently, Shaw's lack of fitness resulted in his exclusion from the Mumbai Ranji team . Although he has made a comeback in the Syed Mushtaq Ali T20 tournament, his performances have been underwhelming so far.","Kevin Pietersen gives no-nonsense advice to Prithvi Shaw.

NEW DELHI: India's legendary batter Sachin Tendulkar paid tribute to his childhood coach, Ramakant Achrekar, describing him as an ""all-rounder"" and a visionary in the field of cricket coaching .Tendulkar unveiled a memorial dedicated to Achrekar at the iconic Shivaji Park in Mumbai, in the presence of Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) chief Raj Thackeray.Tendulkar reminisced about his days under Achrekar's tutelage, highlighting how the coach instilled a solid temperament in his students, enabling them to perform without pressure during matches.""Ajit (Tendulkar's elder brother) used to play, and in matches, his observation was, who were not sir's students, they were tensed. He used to wonder sir's students were never under pressure. Then he realised, sir had a lot of practice matches, and that temperament had been built. I was no exception,"" Tendulkar spoke in Marathi.""Cricket was always going on under sir. Sir used to ask us to bring nets. Jeetu's father had given sir a room, for the club's kit, he told me to use that, and I used to play,"" he added. ""He taught us to value things, we used to do rolling, sprinkle water, put nets, and practice, he trained us. The bond and understanding, a street-smart player, is someone who understands all this, water given to wicket, that's how our brain used to absorb that information while doing that.""Achrekar's innovative coaching methods, which included practice matches and hands-on training, helped develop a street-smart approach in his students.""Sir used to do level 1, 2, 3, 4 coaching in 1970s and 80s. He had a vision to teach players, and respect the kit. I still tell players, that you are on the field because of the bat, respect it. Please remember your cricket kit, don't throw it, put it at a particular space, don't take out your frustration on your cricket kit. I am sitting here because of my kit. I will always pass on sir's messages to the future generation. We will try,"" Tendulkar shared. ""Sir used to tell a lot with his eyes. We used to figure out by his body language. He didn't tell me 'well played' ever. Sir didn't take that chance ever, after a match, he sometimes used to give me money to take a vada pav, that's how I figured, I must have done something well. There was always that kind of affection. We used to go to his home, were invited by him and his wife, and our favourite diet was mutton curry, pav, lemon and onion. Vishakha used to come and serve us.""The memorial, located near Gate No. 5 at Shivaji Park, received approval from the Maharashtra government in August 2022.Tendulkar shared anecdotes about Achrekar's unique coaching methods, such as coding match observations, observing players' actions, and providing practical lessons on field preparation.""Sir had a swiss knife, glue, sand paper, first aid, after match, he used to say 'let's do match demonstration'. He wrote in code language, who did what wrong in the match. Once, during batting, a friend was flying a kite, he would stand and see, and take notes,"" he continued.""Sir was a general store, used to have everything, was very caring. he used to control situations while we were going to the doctor also. He was an all-rounder.""Achrekar, who coached several Indian cricketers, was honoured with the prestigious Dronacharya Award in 1990 and the Padma Shri in 2010. His dedication to shaping the careers of aspiring cricketers has left a lasting impact, and the memorial serves as a motivation for future generations of players.","Sachin Tendulkar has unveiled a memorial to his childhood coach, Ramakant Achrekar.

On this day 17 years ago, Muttiah Muralitharan etched his name in cricketing history by surpassing Shane Warne ’s record for the most Test wickets. The legendary Sri Lankan off-spinner achieved this milestone during a Test match against England in Kandy on December 3, 2007.Muralitharan’s record-breaking wicket came when he dismissed England’s Paul Collingwood , marking his 709th Test wicket, overtaking Warne's tally of 708.The moment was celebrated with immense joy, both on the field and in the cricketing world, as the Lankan wizard became the highest wicket-taker in Test history — a record he still holds to this day.Muralitharan’s achievement was remarkable not only for surpassing Warne but also for doing so in just his 116th Test match — 29 fewer than the Aussie leg-spinner.Known for his extraordinary ability to extract turn and bounce, Muralitharan’s artistry with the ball made him a nightmare for batters worldwide.His incredible work ethic, precision, and consistency enabled him to dominate across all conditions. By the time he retired in 2010, Muralitharan had taken800 Test wickets in just 133 matches, a feat considered nearly unbreakable.Beyond the numbers, Muralitharan's achievement symbolised his relentless dedication to the game and his ability to thrive under pressure. His record-breaking journey was also a source of pride for Sri Lanka, as he elevated the country's stature in international cricket.Seventeen years later, Muralitharan’s legacy continues to inspire budding cricketers, reminding the world of his unparalleled contributions to the sport and his status as one of the greatest bowlers in cricket history.","Muttiah Muralitharan took his 709th Test wicket on December 3, 2007.

His spell, marked by sharp movement and clever variations, reaffirmed his value as a match-winner in white-ball cricket.Having previously represented Chennai Super Kings , Kolkata Knight Riders, and Delhi Capitals, Shardul went unsold in the recently concluded IPL 2025 mega auction .However, his stellar performance in the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy, which turned the game in his team's favor, sent a strong message to franchises, highlighting his readiness to deliver impactful performances at the highest level.",Shardul Thakur takes four-wicket haul against Services in Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy.

#LIVE: India vs Australia, Pink-Ball Test: Rohit Sharma's batting position, the ideal attack & more

NEW DELHI: Former England captain Alastair Cook has commended India's bold decision to exclude veteran off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin from their playing XI for the opening Test in Perth.Cook described the move as 'brave' given Ashwin's stature as one of the world's premier spinners and his ability to make an impact in any conditions. Cook also lauded India's decision to bat first on the bouncy Perth wicket.While some criticised the exclusion of Ashwin, Cook praised India for showing clarity in their tactics, emphasising that such calls reflect the evolving dynamism of modern cricket.Cook, the first England batter to surpass 10,000 Test runs, hailed India for their remarkable comeback after being dismissed for just 150 in the first Test.""I thought India was so brave. I thought that first, you know, they win the toss and bat on that wicket, you look there, even though there's only 150 they got, the thought process to say, 'we're going to take Australia on there. We know it's going to be hard, but we think it's going to be hard for both sides only, and then it'll be a one-innings game',"" Cook said on TNT Sports.""I think most captains would have bowled first, certainly would have done and probably got the end of a bad result, like normally in Australia. But India took it on brilliantly. It was just an all-round fantastic performance.""You think... bowled out for 150, you think we're struggling here, but to bounce back when you've got Boomer ( Jasprit Bumrah ) up with the new ball on those kinds of wickets, he's always going to be outstanding and backed up by the team,"" Cook added.Leading the side in Rohit Sharma's absence, pace spearhead Jasprit Bumrah delivered a stellar performance, claiming eight wickets, including a first-innings five-for, to guide India to a memorable victory.Commenting on India's decision to exclude senior off-spinner Ashwin from the playing XI, Cook said, ""... Just think of how brave they were? They didn't bother playing Ashwin who has got 500 Test wickets. They've kind of played a couple of like, not makes you spinners, but you know, I thought Ashwin would have been outstanding, but you know, great thinking by them.""And isn't it nice to see Australia get thrashed?""","Alastair Cook hails India's bold decision to exclude Ravichandran Ashwin from playing XI for the opening Test in Perth.

Jitesh Sharma was recently bought by Royal Challengers Bengaluru for Rs 11 crore at the IPL 2025 mega auction. It was a massive raise from the Rs 20 lakh Punjab Kings paid for the wicketkeeper-batter in 2022 as the right-hander was rewarded for his power hitting lower down the order. In the last few editions, Jitesh has been very consistent with his big hitting towards the fag end of the innings and it also helped him find a place in India's T20I side.The 31-year-old was naturally in demand at the IPL mega auction and RCB , who were looking for Dinesh Karthik's replacement, were determined to have him in their set-up. In an exclusive conversation with TimesofIndia.com, Jitesh downplayed the pressure of high price tag and considers it as a challenge to do better for the side.""Whatever price is on my head, it does not matter to me. I just want to play cricket, that’s it. It doesn’t add any pressure; it gives me a challenge and a thrill. It has given me confidence more than pressure, knowing that I am worth ₹11 crore. The fact that RCB has shown faith in me makes me confident and excited to play,"" says Jitesh.Jitesh was in the leadership group of his previous franchise Punjab Kings as the stumper was appointed the vice-captain in the previous edition. He wasn't retained but PBKS did exercise the Right to Match option at Rs 7 crore, which was the highest bid in the room at that point. RCB, with the highest bid, were given a chance to increase the bid and they added another Rs 4 crore to make it Rs 11 crore. He will now move base to Bengaluru for the Indian Premier League and can't wait to play in front of the very loyal and passionate fan base.""I am very excited to play in front of the fans because, right now, I am in Vizag, and I can see the loyalty and craziness of the fans towards RCB. When I go to bat, I see fans shouting, 'RCB, RCB, RCB!' I can feel their enthusiasm, madness, and loyalty towards RCB. It will be fun, and I am very excited and thrilled to play in front of them,"" says Jitesh, who is leading Vidarbha in the ongoing Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy.When asked what RCB fans can expect, Jitesh promises ""entertainment and performance.""Jitesh also emphasised his flexibility in batting positions, stating his willingness to contribute wherever the team needs him.""I don’t mind batting anywhere, as long as it helps the team. I can bat anywhere, anytime, if the team demands—that’s my ideology, simple and clear,"" he adds.On the prospect of playing under Virat Kohli’s captaincy, Jitesh says, ""It will be great to play under Virat Kohli. I would love to play under him because he is so energetic and enthusiastic—it can push my limits. A person who is always involved in the game can inspire me to push my game further.""The right-hander also admires Kohli's consistency and fitness, and wants to learn from the former India captain.""I think I’ll try to learn from Kohli’s consistency and how he has kept himself fit and motivated over all these years,"" says Jitesh.There was a bidding war for Jitesh in the auction hall as Delhi Capitals, Lucknow Super Giants, Chennai Super Kings and Royal Challengers Bengaluru wanted him in their set-up. Even PBKS used the RTM option but RCB had kept enough money for him and Jitesh can't wait to be part of the ""perfect team"".""I wasn’t expecting anything from the auction. I was just hoping and praying to join a good team where I could play freely and express myself. I am incredibly grateful and thankful to God that I went to RCB—it feels like the perfect team for me,"" says Jitesh.For Punjab Kings, Jitesh Sharma played 40 matches, maintaining a strike rate of over 151.14, solidifying his reputation in the league.

If 'not looking back' required an analogy, Jasprit Bumrah 's cricket journey is the perfect fit.The teenager from Gujarat with an awkward bowling action impressed former Mumbai Indians (MI) coach John Wright during one of his scouting tours in 2013, and the franchise chose to invest in Wright's foresight. Eleven years from that day, the right-arm pacer stands as probably the greatest fast bowler of his era.Ashish Nehra recently remarked that ""even an IPL purse of Rs 520 crore won't be enough for IPL teams"" to bring Bumrah in their camp. But that possibility has never arrived.Since 2014, when an uncapped 21-year-old Jasprit Bumrah was bought by Mumbai Indians for Rs 1.20 crore after making his debut for the franchise a season earlier, he has never been in the auction pool again as MI retained him ahead of every season since.So the only chance for IPL franchises to get Bumrah at the auction came a decade ago, and it's unlikely that the Reliance-owned MI will ever let go of the pacer who has gained legendary status across formats.But if the Gujarat's selectors had made a different choice eleven years ago, Jasprit Bumrah's trajectory might have been entirely different -- today, there's consensus that he is a once-in-a-generation talent, a true blessing for Indian cricket.The events leading to Bumrah's selection for the 2013 Syed Mushtaq Ali tournament tell a compelling tale, as remarkable as his ability to unsettle batsmen at the crease.A native of Ahmedabad, Bumrah developed his cricket skills in the compound of Goyal Intercity, the residential complex where he lived. During this time, his mother worked diligently to support the family following his father's untimely death.As a student at Nirman High School, Bumrah harboured aspirations of cricket success. However, with limited progress and opportunity, he considered abandoning cricket in 2012 and relocating to Canada.But his selection to the district team marked the beginning of an upward trajectory. The competition effectively served as a selection trial for the state squad. Despite playing only one match, Bumrah's wicket-taking performance proved sufficient to secure his place in Gujarat's state team.(Photo Source: X)Bumrah made his first class, List A and T20 debuts in 2013. But it was at the Syed Mushtaq Ali T20 tournament where he caught the eye of the then MI coach Wright.In 2013, Bumrah emerged in the IPL, showcasing his unique bowling technique with a stiff-arm action. During his debut match, he claimed three wickets whilst Chris Gayle was dominating for Royal Challengers Bangalore. But he got to play only two matches that season.His exceptional skills at bowling yorkers and managing death overs caught the attention of BCCI selectors. Within three years of his IPL introduction, these abilities paved the way for his selection to the national team.Bumrah's international journey began with an ODI against Australia in January 2016, followed by his T20I debut three days later. His Test cricket initiation came two years afterwards, when he played against South Africa at Cape Town in January 2018.His subsequent achievements and wicket-taking abilities grew in such a manner that even the legend of the game now believe that he is one of the greatest to grace the sport.Given his history of back problems and injuries, the Team India staff now carefully monitors his playing schedule and workload. After all, such rare talents are discovered only once in a generation.",Jasprit Bumrah is considered to be one of the greatest fast bowlers of his era. The 21-year-old was bought by Mumbai Indians for Rs 1.20 crore in 2014. He has never been in the IPL auction pool again as MI retained him.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115931215,imgsize-51948,width-400,resizemode-4/115931215.jpg"

The outlet noted that children were among the deceased, with several critically injured victims receiving treatment at a regional hospital.Video footage from the venue showed supporters protesting referee decisions before conflicts erupted, with spectators spilling onto the pitch.The recordings captured people fleeing the stadium, with many scaling the high perimeter fence.Additional footage showed numerous casualties on a hospital floor surrounded by people providing assistance to the wounded.The National Alliance for Alternation and Democracy opposition group demanded an inquiry, criticising the tournament as a vehicle for promoting the military leader's ""illegal and inappropriate"" political aspirations.Guinea has been under military governance since the 2021 coup that removed President Alpha Conde. It joins other West African nations, including Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso, where military takeovers have delayed civilian rule restoration.Doumbouya, who led the coup three years ago, claimed to prevent national chaos and criticised the previous administration's unfulfilled promises, though he faces criticism for not meeting public expectations.","A tragic stampede at a football stadium in southern Guinea resulted in 56 fatalities and numerous injuries.

The morgue is full.""""There are around 100 dead"", said one doctor, while another said there were ""dozens of dead"".According to witnesses, the anger was fueled by a referee's decision that was contested, after which the fans invaded the pitch and later also set the N'Zerekore police station on fire.Media reports indicated that the game was organised as part of a tournament dedicated to Guinea's current president and junta chief, Mamadi Doumbouya , who took control through a coup in 2021.In Guinea, these tournaments have become increasingly prevalent as Doumbouya appears to be positioning himself for the anticipated presidential elections next year, whilst political alignments continue to develop.In September 2021, Doumbouya, then serving as a colonel, led a successful coup against President Alpha Conde. Ironically, Conde had previously appointed Doumbouya to lead an elite unit responsible for protecting the president from such takeovers.Despite international demands and his initial commitment to transfer authority to civilian leadership by December 2024, Doumbouya has since reversed his stance and indicated he will retain power.","Clashes erupted at a football match in N'Zerekore, Guinea, on Sunday, leaving many dead.

'Good attitude again'

MADRID: Spanish champions Real Madrid beat Getafe 2-0 to move second in La Liga on Sunday with Kylian Mbappe finding the net after a difficult week.The French striker has been criticised in recent weeks for his form but after Jude Bellingham opened the scoring from the penalty spot, Mbappe slotted home a well-taken second.Later, Mbappe wasted three other big chances but Madrid were able to move within one point of league leaders Barcelona, who lost on Saturday at home against Las Palmas.Carlo Ancelotti's side have played one fewer game than the Catalans, and Atletico Madrid, third, who are one point behind.""(Mbappe) played very well, he was active, dangerous as always,"" said Ancelotti. ""He scored an important goal, he created chances in the second half and had a very active game, it's what we want from him.""Mbappe, playing in his favoured role on the left with Vinicius Junior out injured, was offered plenty of support by Madrid's fans.""The fans understand more than anyone what moment the team is in, and the players (are in),"" added Ancelotti.Getafe set out to slow the game down and they largely succeeded until Allan Nyom tugged down Antonio Rudiger in the area after half an hour.After Mbappe missed his penalty against Liverpool in the Champions League defeat at Anfield on Wednesday, Bellingham stepped up to take the spot-kick.The England international outfoxed David Soria to send Madrid ahead on the half-hour with his third goal in three league games.""Today Bellingham or Mbappe had to choose (who took the penalty), they both chose Bellingham,"" said Ancelotti.Mbappe doubled his team's lead with a superb strike seven minutes prior to the break, after Bellingham spread the ball out to him on the left flank.The France captain drove inside and curled home a low effort inside the far post for his eighth league goal of the season.Ancelotti took off Bellingham at half-time because of an apparent knock sustained in a collision with Soria, but later said he thought the midfielder would recover quickly.Mbappe produced a glorious chipped pass to put Brahim Diaz in behind early in the second period, but the Morocco international's effort sailed narrowly over the crossbar.The forward came millimetres away from scoring a second himself but after rounding Soria squeezed a shot just wide of the far post.Soria made a good save to deny Fede Valverde as Getafe battled to keep the scoreline respectable.Mbappe spurned another chance to score when he fired off-target after being played in again, but Getafe could not capitalise on his profligacy.John Patrick had the visitors' best chance with a powerful effort which hit the crossbar then the post.Mbappe had another chance in stoppage time but misfired from close range as his anxiety to prove his worth in a Madrid shirt following his summer move from Paris Saint-Germain continued to tell, despite his goal.Madrid face Athletic Bilbao in midweek, hoping to build on their run of three consecutive La Liga wins.""We've had a lot of injuries (but) we are there fighting, battling,"" said Ancelotti. ""What gives me the most confidence is that we had a good attitude again, concentration, we had spirit.""Bit by bit the problems we've had, we will solve, and in the meanwhile we will be there fighting.""",Real Madrid beat Getafe 2-0 to move second in La Liga.

'A great day'

LIVERPOOL: Liverpool have been used to second best during Pep Guardiola's era at Manchester City , but a 2-0 victory over the crisis-hit champions left little doubt over who are the team to beat in this season's Premier League title race.Goals in either half from Cody Gakpo and Mohamed Salah at Anfield on Sunday did not do justice to the scale of the Reds' domination as City succumbed to a sixth defeat in a seven-game winless run.Arsenal and Chelsea are now Liverpool's closest challengers, nine points behind, with City 11 back and almost certain to finally loose their grip on the English top flight after an unprecedented four consecutive titles and six in the past seven seasons.Guardiola reminded the Anfield crowd of that fact by raising six fingers when taunted with chants of ""sacked in the morning"".The Catalan's defiance, though, could not mask the fact that City have rested on their laurels, while Liverpool have stepped up a level under Arne Slot.Slot appeared to have the impossible job of succeeding the much-loved Jurgen Klopp.The charismatic German brought Liverpool back to the top of English and Europeanfootball . His title triumph in 2019/2020 was the club's first for 30 years and the only blot on City's dominance in recent times.In contrast to Alex Ferguson's departure from Manchester United and Arsene Wenger's exit at Arsenal, Liverpool have turned a legendary figure leaving into a positive.Klopp did much of the groundwork himself, rejuvenating the squad over his final 18 months in charge with the signings of Gakpo, Alexis Mac Allister, Dominik Szoboszlai and Ryan Gravenberch.Slot's only summer signing, Federico Chiesa, has barely featured due to injury.But the injection of fresh blood, mixed with the experience of title winners in the prolific Salah, captain Virgil van Dijk, Andy Roberson and Trent Alexander-Arnold has proved a winning combination.Slot has been keen to give Klopp's legacy credit, but the Dutchman deserves his due for the small details that have produced a run of 18 wins from his first 20 games in all competitions.Robertson and Alexander-Arnold's narrower positions have left Liverpool less vulnerable in transition and contributed to them having the best defensive record in the league.Gravenberch has shone since being transformed into a holding midfielder, while Gakpo is finally delivering on his potential under his compatriot.Slot has also managed to keep Liverpool's momentum rolling despite constant speculation over the futures of Salah, Van Dijk and Alexander-Arnold, all of whom are out of contract at the end of the season.""City are a fantastic team, four times champions in a row and they have quality to punish any team,"" said Van Dijk. ""So, overall, it has been a great day.""It's game-by-game and stay calm. But games like this, when you win it like this, is always a good feeling.""It is not just the Premier League that Slot has so far bent to his will.Liverpool are also top of the Champions League with a perfect record from five games, including a memorable 2-0 win over Real Madrid on Wednesday.Victory over City capped a dream week, but the former Feyenoord boss was still keen to use the English and European champions as the benchmark for his side's aspirations.""Real Madrid and Manchester City have been and are so good, with managers that have won so many trophies, so it is always nice to come out of those situations as a winner,"" added Slot.""But they were able to win every single three days. We understand what we want to achieve is more than this winning once or twice, even against these big teams, if you want to win big things.""December may only be a day old, but already it is hard to see beyond Liverpool matching Manchester United's record tally for 20 English top-flight titles come May.",Liverpool beat Manchester City 2-0 in the Premier League on Sunday. Goals from Cody Gakpo and Mohamed Salah secured the win. Arne Slot's side are now nine points clear of Arsenal and Chelsea. The Dutchman has won 18 of his first 20 games in charge of Liverpool.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115881457,imgsize-70304,width-400,resizemode-4/115881457.jpg"

NEW DELHI: In a crucial La Liga encounter at the Santiago Bernabeu on Sunday, Real Madrid secured a 2-0 victory over Getafe , propelling them within striking distance of league leaders Barcelona . The match witnessed two significant moments that shaped the outcome.The first pivotal moment came when Real Madrid was awarded a penalty. Jude Bellingham , the young English midfielder, stepped up to take the spot-kick instead of Kylian Mbappe , who had missed a penalty in Real's previous Champions League match against Liverpool.Bellingham displayed composure and precision, sending the ball straight down the middle to give Real Madrid the lead.The second defining moment occurred in the 38th minute when Kylian Mbappe doubled Real Madrid's advantage.The French striker showcased his clinical finishing abilities by expertly converting a brilliant pass from Bellingham, whipping the ball into the net from outside the box. This goal marked Mbappe's 10th across all competitions for Real Madrid this season.With this victory, Real Madrid climbed to second place in the La Liga table, accumulating 33 points from 14 matches.They trail their fierce rivals Barcelona by a single point, although Barcelona has played one game more. On the other hand, Getafe's struggles continued as they remain in 17th place, having collected only 13 points from 15 matches.The match highlighted the attacking acumen of Real Madrid's young talents, Bellingham and Mbappe, who combined effectively to secure the three points.Their contributions were instrumental in keeping Real Madrid's title aspirations alive as they continue to chase Barcelona in the race for the La Liga crown.","Real Madrid secured a 2-0 victory over Getafe at the Santiago Bernabeu.

NEW DELHI: Former world number one tennis player from Romania Simona Halep has raised concerns about the perceived discrepancies in the treatment of cases involving positive tests for banned substances by the International Tennis Integrity Agency ( ITIA ).Her criticism stems from the recent one-month ban imposed on Iga Swiatek , the current world number two, after testing positive for the heart medication trimetazidine (TMZ) in an out-of-competition sample.Halep, who returned to tennis in March 2023 after serving a provisional suspension since October 2022 for testing positive for roxadustat at the US Open, believes there is a lack of consistency in the ITIA's approach.She questions the significant difference in the penalties handed out to her and Swiatek, despite the cases occurring around the same time.In her statement, Halep expressed her bewilderment at the disparate treatment and questioned the logical reasoning behind the ITIA's decisions.

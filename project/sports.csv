Poll What do you think was the main reason for MI's defeat against GT? Poor weather conditions Sub-par batting performance Dropped catches No-balls bowled by MI

Bombay Sport Exchange Ep 4: Prof. Ratnakar Shetty on BCCI, cricket politics & Indian cricket's growth

NEW DELHI: Mumbai Indians captain Hardik Pandya described the no-balls bowled by him and his teammates as a ""crime"" following their three-wicket defeat via the DLS method against Gujarat Titans in a thrilling contest at the Wankhede Stadium. In the midst of a tight playoffs race, heavy rain momentarily swung momentum in Mumbai’s favour, with the hosts ahead by five runs on the DLS chart after 18 overs.As MI waited in the dressing room, hoping for a rain-shortened win, Gujarat Titans remained ready for any opportunity.Eventually, there was just enough time left on the clock for a one-over shootout to determine the winner. GT needed 15 runs off the final six deliveries, and Mumbai were left with only four fielders outside the inner circle after being penalised for a slow over rate.Deepak Chahar was handed the task of bowling the final over. He conceded a boundary and then a massive six, reducing the equation to five runs from three balls. Succumbing to pressure, he bowled a no-ball that handed the momentum squarely to the Titans.In addition to Deepak’s costly error, Hardik himself overstepped twice during his 11-ball eighth over. The no-ball troubles weren’t MI’s only missteps—earlier, they dropped a crucial catch of Gujarat captain Shubman Gill on the second ball of the 12th over. Gill miscued a shot off Ashwani Kumar, and though Tilak Varma sprinted in to take the catch, he failed to hold on.Reflecting on the defeat, which ended MI’s six-match winning streak, Hardik said, ""Catches did not really cost us, but the no-balls, with my no-balls and even in the last no-ball, in my eyes in T20s, it is a crime and more often than not, it bites you. But I am really happy with the boys for giving their 120 per cent, ensuring we were in the game and not giving up.""Mumbai's bowlers had fought valiantly after the batters put up a sub-par performance. Despite top-order failures, Will Jacks (53), Suryakumar Yadav (35), and Corbin Bosch (27) managed to take MI to 155/8—helped by some fortunate moments.Jasprit Bumrah and Trent Boult then led a spirited bowling effort. Bumrah dismissed Gill and Shahrukh Khan, while Boult trapped Sherfane Rutherford lbw to keep MI in the hunt.Hardik admitted that Mumbai were 20–30 runs short of a competitive total but commended the bowling unit for their resilience.""Yes, definitely (tough way to go down). We fought well with the total we had. Most of the time, we were out of the game, but we pushed as a group. It was a game of margins,"" he said.""It was definitely not a 150-wicket. It was a 175-wicket, we were short in batting by 20-25 or maybe 30 runs if we had batted well. Credit to the bowlers. They kept fighting, and we could not finish the job,"" he added.Rain repeatedly interrupted the match, and although Hardik acknowledged the disruptions were far from ideal, he stressed the need to adapt.""The ground, in the first innings, was not wet, but post that, throughout, the ball kept getting wetter. Not sure if it helped us or not, it was difficult. Rain kept coming in, not ideal to have stoppages and start again. But the game goes on, we had to play a game (in the end), and we definitely did,"" he concluded.","Hardik Pandya describes no-balls bowled by Mumbai Indians as a ""crime"" MI lost by three wickets via the DLS method against Gujarat Titans.

NEW DELHI: Singer Rahul Vaidya recently found himself at the centre of a social media storm after calling cricket superstar Virat Kohli a ""joker"".Addressing the backlash, Vaidya clarified, "" Mai bhi Virat Kohli k fan hu yaar. Maine ko pagal nahi bola hai, joker bola hai (I'm also a fan of Virat Kohli, man.

Kohli had inadvertently liked actress Avneet Kaur’s Instagram photo, sparking widespread chatter.Fueling the frenzy, Vaidya posted a humorous video mocking Kohli’s explanation by mimicking his words and sarcastically blaming Instagram’s algorithm for accidental likes.“Jo bhi ladki ho, please don’t do PR around it… it’s Instagram’s mistake, okay?” he quipped.The situation escalated when Vaidya revealed that Kohli had blocked him on Instagram.“Virat Kohli has blocked me… Maybe it’s another algorithm error,” he joked, continuing his playful tone.However, what triggered a more intense reaction from fans was a cryptic follow-up post from Vaidya: “Virat Kohli’s fans are even bigger jokers than Virat!” accompanied by a clown emoji.The remark didn’t sit well with Kohli’s loyal supporters, many of whom responded with angry messages, and some even targeted Vaidya's family.","Rahul Vaidya recently found himself at the centre of a social media storm.

Bombay Sport Exchange Ep 4: Prof. Ratnakar Shetty on BCCI, cricket politics & Indian cricket's growth

In a nail-biting encounter punctuated by two rain interruptions, the Gujarat Titans held their nerve to secure a thrilling three-wicket victory over the Mumbai Indians on the final ball of their match at the Wankhede Stadium .The hard-fought win propelled the Gujarat Titans to the top of the league standings in a rain-affected affair that kept fans on the edge of their seats until the very last moment.Chasing 156, the Gujarat Titans didn't have a great start, with Trent Boult removing the in-form Sai Sudharsan early.Captain Shubman Gill (43) and Jos Buttler (30) put on a 72-run partnership for the second wicket and looked at ease to chase down the total.Left-arm seamer Ashwani Kumar, who came in as a concussion substitute for Corbin Bosch, dismissed Buttler.However, Sherfane Rutherford's quickfire 14-ball innings kept the Titans ahead before the first rain break.Once the match resumed, it was all about Jasprit Bumrah The speedster knocked over Gujarat captain Shubman Gill with a peach of a delivery, followed it with a corker to castle Shahrukh Khan.From the other end, the left-arm quicks Boult and Ashwani dismissed Rutherford and Rashid Khan, respectively, before the second rain break.The match was reduced to 19 overs per side, and the Titans needed 15 runs in the last over.The final over, bowled by Deepak Chahar, was a rollercoaster of emotions.Rahul Tewatia smashed a four off the first ball, followed by a single.Gerald Coetzee then deposited Chahar for a six on a no-ball.Tewatia leveled the scores off the free hit.Chahar managed to dismiss Coetzee, but Arshad Khan kept his cool under pressure, as he squeezed a quick single on the final delivery to seal a memorable and crucial victory for the Gujarat Titans.For the Mumbai Indians, Jasprit Bumrah (2/19), Trent Boult (2/19), and Ashwani Kumar (2/22) picked up two wickets apiece.It was an eventful first 20 overs at the Wankhede after Gujarat Titans captain Shubman Gill won the toss and opted to field first against Mumbai Indians.Titans bowlers restricted Mumbai Indians to 155/8.While Wankhede is generally considered a batter's paradise, suggesting 155 isn't even a par score, there was something in it for the bowlers, both spinners and pacers. The Gujarat Titans, though, weren't at their best in the field initially.However, they recovered from early fielding howlers while spin ace Rashid Khan (1/21) rediscovered his mojo.Despite dropping as many as three catches in the powerplay, Gujarat fought back through their spinners Rashid and R Sai Kishore (2/34) to grab control of the game in which Mumbai Indians crumbled under pressure.Will Jacks was dropped twice, and Suryakumar Yadav once – chances that any team can't afford to miss.But they kept fighting, kept chipping away, and rattled the hosts during the middle phase, reducing them from 97 for 2 to 113 for 6.Mumbai Indians never got the launching pad to accelerate in the final few overs.A half-century for Jacks, his first in IPL 2025 , and Corbin Bosch's late 22-ball 27 with two sixes and one four took Mumbai Indians past 150.Both Suryakumar and Jacks made the most of those lifelines to put on 71 runs off 43 balls for the third wicket, but their exit in consecutive overs saw GT's spinners, with Rashid in the forefront, applying the perfect squeeze.",Gujarat Titans held their nerve to secure a thrilling three-wicket victory over the Mumbai Indians on the final ball of their match at the Wankhede Stadium.

Gujarat Titans have claimed the top spot on the IPL 2025 points table following a three-wicket victory over Mumbai Indians at the Wankhede Stadium . The win, their eighth of the season, took them to 16 points from 12 matches with a healthy Net Run Rate (NRR) +0.753, marking a strong push toward securing a playoff berth.Mumbai Indians, are at fourth position after the loss.With 14 points from 12 games and a NRR of +1.156.

Their impressive NRR of +0.482 keeps them in strong contention for a top-two finish. Punjab Kings , who have quietly built momentum this season, follow closely in third place with 15 points from 11 games and an NRR of +0.376.Delhi Capitals occupy fifth spot with six wins in 11 games.

Mumbai weather prediction

Gujarat Titans (GT) and Mumbai Indians (MI) are set for a high-stakes IPL 2025 clash on Tuesday, with both teams eyeing playoff spots. Third-placed MI, riding a six-match winning streak and boasting the tournament's best Net Run Rate, need two wins from three remaining games to secure qualification. GT, in fourth place, also require two victories from their final four fixtures.The Titans' top order — B Sai Sudharsan (504 runs), Jos Buttler (470), and Shubman Gill (465) — has been key to their success. However, they'll be tested against MI’s formidable bowling attack led by Trent Boult (16 wickets), Jasprit Bumrah (11), and all-rounder Hardik Pandya (13 wickets, 157 runs). MI’s bowlers have not conceded over 200 runs in their last six games.While GT thrive batting first, they’ve also won all three of their chases convincingly. However, the lack of middle-order contributions, apart from Sherfane Rutherford (201), may be a concern.For MI, batters like Suryakumar Yadav (475), Ryan Rickelton (334), and Rohit Sharma (293) are peaking at the right time. GT’s bowlers, led by Prasidh Krishna (19 wickets), will need to deliver again, especially with Kagiso Rabada’s status still uncertain after a provisional suspension.The center of the square is with 63-meter boundaries on either side and 73 meters straight down the ground. There’s a good grass covering on the surface, but underneath, it’s quite dry with a slight bristle, suggesting the ball might grip and hold a touch early on. Retaining moisture has clearly been a challenge for the groundstaff. As the game progresses, the surface may slow down a bit, aiding spinners and slower bowlers. That said, chasing could be the better option, with conditions possibly improving under lights — though it’s a brave call in these humid conditions.Mumbai Indians predicted XI: Ryan Rickelton (wk), Rohit Sharma, Will Jacks, Suryakumar Yadav, Tilak Varma, Hardik Pandya (c), Naman Dhir, Corbin Bosch, Deepak Chahar, Trent Boult, Jasprit BumrahImpact Player – Karn SharmaGujarat Titans predicted XI: Sai Sudharsan, Shubman Gill (c), Jos Buttler (wk), Washington Sundar, Rahul Tewatia, Shahrukh Khan, Rashid Khan, Ravisrinivasan Sai Kishore, Gerald Coetzee, Mohammed Siraj, Prasidh KrishnaImpact Player - Ishant SharmaHardik Pandya (c), Rohit Sharma, Suryakumar Yadav, Robin Minz (wk), Ryan Rickelton (wk), Shrijith Krishnan (wk), Bevon Jacobs, Tilak Varma, Naman Dhir, Will Jacks, Mitchell Santner, Raj Angad Bawa, Raghu Sharma, Corbin Bosch, Trent Boult, Karn Sharma, Deepak Chahar, Ashwani Kumar, Reece Topley, VS Penmetsa, Arjun Tendulkar, Mujeeb Ur Rahman, Jasprit Bumrah.Shubman Gill (c), Jos Buttler (wk), Kumar Kushagra (wk), Anuj Rawat (wk), Sherfane Rutherford, Nishant Sidhu, Mahipal Lomror, Washington Sundar, Mohammed Arshad Khan, R Sai Kishore, Jayant Yadav, Karim Janat, B Sai Sudharsan, Dasun Shanaka, Shahrukh Khan, Mohammed Siraj, Prasidh Krishna, Manav Suthar, Gerald Coetzee, Gurnoor Singh Brar, Ishant Sharma, Kulwant Khejroliya, Rahul Tewatia, Rashid Khan.Played: 6MI wins: 2GT wins: 4Expect a mainly cloudy day in Mumbai with a couple of showers possible during the afternoon.

How we arrive at the probabilities:

With 15 games remaining in the IPL 2025 league stage, Chennai Super Kings, Rajasthan Royals and Sunrisers Hyderabad are already out of contention for the playoffs.Royal Challengers Bengaluru, Punjab Kings and Gujarat Titans are almost sure to make the knock-out stage and Mumbai Indians are also strong contenders, but Delhi Capitals still have a fair chance and Lucknow Super Giants and Kolkata Knight Riders slim chances.There remain 32,768 possible combinations of results, so nothing is for sure yet for any of the seven remaining in the race.There are 32,768 possible combinations of results remaining with 15 games to go. For each team, we looked at how many of these end up with them being among the top four either singly or tied.

Bombay Sport Exchange Ep 4: Prof. Ratnakar Shetty on BCCI, cricket politics & Indian cricket's growth

Heavy rain on Monday washed out the Indian Premier League match between Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) and Delhi Capitals (DC) at the Rajiv Gandhi Stadium. Both teams received one point apiece.With the match ending in a no result, Pat Cummins' SRH were knocked out of the playoffs race. The result also put DC's chances in limbo.Axar Patel's team's next three matches are against Punjab Kings (PBKS), Gujarat Titans (GT), and Mumbai Indians (MI). They will now have to win at least two of those matches to remain in contention for the playoffs.Earlier in the evening, after being sent in to bat, SRH restricted DC to a modest 133/7.Cummins struck in the first over, dismissing Karun Nair with the first delivery of the match. A well-pitched delivery in the corridor induced an edge to wicketkeeper Ishan Kishan, who was replacing Heinrich Klaasen behind the stumps.The SRH skipper claimed his second wicket when Faf du Plessis edged behind to Kishan after advancing down the track, leaving Delhi at 6/2 in 2.1 overs.Cummins completed his early assault by removing Abhishek Porel in his third over. A delivery that stopped on the pitch resulted in a leading edge that Kishan caught after running towards square leg.The fielding excellence continued as Cummins took a spectacular one-handed catch at mid-off to dismiss Axar Patel off Harshal Patel's bowling.Jaydev Unadkat added to Delhi's troubles by having Rahul Tewatia caught behind, marking a historic moment as all top four batsmen were dismissed caught by the wicketkeeper for the first time in IPL history.Delhi found themselves reeling at 29/5 in the eighth over before Tristan Stubbs and debutant Vipraj Nigam attempted to rebuild the innings.Their 33-run partnership ended in unusual circumstances when both batsmen ended up at the keeper's end, resulting in Vipraj's run-out.Impact Player Ashutosh Sharma , who replaced Porel, provided some resistance with an attacking innings. He hit two sixes off Zeeshan Ansari and continued his assault against Harshal Patel and Eshan Malinga.Ashutosh's quickfire 41 off 28 balls, along with Stubbs' contribution of 41 runs, helped Delhi recover from their early collapse to post 133/7 in their allocated 20 overs.Cummins finished with impressive figures of 3 for 19, while Unadkat provided good support with 1 for 13. The pitch offered assistance to the pace bowlers throughout the innings.","Heavy rain on Monday washed out the Indian Premier League match between Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) and Delhi Capitals (DC) Both teams received one point apiece.

Poll Should the BCCI limit salaries for uncapped players? Not sure Only for certain players No, players should earn what they can Yes, to ensure fairness

NEW DELHI: Cricket legend Sunil Gavaskar has criticized the Board of Control for Cricket in India BCCI ) for altering its rules to accommodate MS Dhoni as an “uncapped player” ahead of the 2025 Indian Premier League (IPL) season. In his column in Sportstar, Gavaskar raised alarm over the soaring salaries of uncapped players, cautioning that such moves could damage the future of Indian cricket.The BCCI revived a rule — scrapped in 2021 — that allows an Indian player who hasn’t played international cricket in five years to be considered “uncapped.” This enabled Chennai Super Kings to retain Dhoni for Rs 4 crore under the uncapped player category.“To accommodate Mahendra Singh Dhoni , who became an uncapped player before the auction last year, the limit was raised to Rs 4 crore,” Gavaskar noted, calling the move a disappointing example of convenience over merit.He also questioned the value of splurging on untested talent. “A whole lot of the players bought for huge amounts simply fade away as their hunger and drive are satiated... Indian cricket takes a bit of a beating at the loss of any player whether he has been successful or not,” he wrote.“In all these years, it is hard to recall an uncapped player bought for huge numbers who has justified his inclusion in the team,” Gavaskar added, while noting that players often perform better once price and pressure drop.Gavaskar urged the BCCI to reverse the rule change and limit salaries for uncapped players to safeguard Indian cricket’s long-term interests.",The BCCI revived a rule that allows an Indian player who hasn’t played international cricket in five years to be considered “uncapped” This enabled Chennai Super Kings to retain Dhoni for Rs 4 crore under the uncapped player category.

Kolkata Knight Riders face a must-win clash against Chennai Super Kings at Eden Gardens on Wednesday, with their playoff hopes hanging by a thread.KKR, currently on 11 points, must win all three of their remaining matches to reach 17, with qualification likely coming down to net run rate and other results. They come into the game on the back of a dramatic one-run win over Rajasthan Royals, boosted by Andre Russell’s explosive return to form.Venkatesh Iyer, under pressure due to his hefty price tag, will be keen to contribute significantly, while Russell’s battle against CSK’s spinners, especially Ravindra Jadeja and Ravichandran Ashwin, could prove decisive on a surface offering some grip.CSK, though out of the playoff race, are not expected to make it easy for the hosts. Youngster Ayush Mhatre has been a revelation, stepping in for injured captain Ruturaj Gaikwad. The 17-year-old made an instant impact with a 32-run cameo against Mumbai Indians and followed it up with a stunning 94 off 48 balls versus RCB, despite the team’s narrow loss.With little to lose, CSK are likely to play with freedom, making for a high-stakes and entertaining encounter between two high-profile sides.The Eden Gardens surface presents a fascinating challenge. With dimensions of 66m and 60m square, and 74m straight, it’s a relatively small ground, favouring big hitters. The pitch itself appears dry and dark with patches of dead grass and a few bare areas. Although it lacks live grass, the surface is holding together well and is unlikely to break up or behave inconsistently like the occasional jigsaw-type Eden wicket. There could be some early grip for spinners as it may slow down in the first half, but overall, it looks good for batting.Rahmanullah Gurbaz (w), Sunil Narine, Ajinkya Rahane (c), Angkrish Raghuvanshi, Moeen Ali, Venkatesh Iyer, Rinku Singh, Andre Russell, Ramandeep Singh, Varun Chakaravarthy, Vaibhav AroraImpact Player – Harshit RanaShaik Rasheed, Ayush Mhatre, Sam Curran, Ravindra Jadeja, Dewald Brevis, Deepak Hooda, MS Dhoni (w/c), Noor Ahmad, Khaleel Ahmed, Anshul Kamboj, Matheesha PathiranaImpact Player - Shivam DubeAjinkya Rahane (c), Rinku Singh, Quinton de Kock (wk), Rahmanullah Gurbaz (wk), Angkrish Raghuvanshi, Rovman Powell, Manish Pandey, Luvnith Sisodia, Venkatesh Iyer, Anukul Roy, Moeen Ali, Ramandeep Singh, Andre Russell, Anrich Nortje, Vaibhav Arora, Mayank Markande, Spencer Johnson, Harshit Rana, Sunil Narine, Varun Chakaravarthy and Chetan Sakariya.MS Dhoni (c, wk), Shaik Rasheed, Ayush Mhatre, Deepak Hooda, Sam Curran, Ravindra Jadeja, Dewald Brevis, Shivam Dube, Noor Ahmad, Khaleel Ahmed, Matheesha Pathirana, Anshul Kamboj, R Ashwin, Kamlesh Nagarkoti, Ramakrishna Ghosh, Jamie Overton, Vijay Shankar, Rahul Tripathi, Shreyas Gopal, Devon Conway, Rachin Ravindra, Mukesh Choudhary, Nathan Ellis, C Andre Siddarth, Urvil Patel.Played: 30KKR wins: 11CSK wins: 19Kolkata will experience a partly sunny and very warm Wednesday, with a chance of isolated thunderstorms in the afternoon, but the weather is expected to clear up by evening.

KOLKATA: The Indian Super League Shield and Cup winners Mohun Bagan Super Giant have been handed a surprise national ban on registration of new players because of a ‘technical glitch’ linked to the transfer of Australian striker Jason Cummings two years ago.The club said on Monday that it’s a minor issue which is expected to be resolved soon. Sources said that a FIFA rule in the international transfer system — called ‘solidarity contribution’ — has led to the ban for Jose Molina’s side.Bagan announced the signing of Cummings on a threeyear contract on June 28 in 2023. However, the FIFA Clearing House has flagged Bagan’s failure in clearing the SC linked to Cummings’ transfer.(SC) is a mechanism Fifa introduced with the international transfer system (ITS) following the Bosman ruling. When a Fifa-registered player makes an international transfer to another club in a different national association or country, a small percentage of the transfer fees (paid by the new club) is used as a form of compensation or solidarity fund and is given to the clubs and academies which have helped train and develop the player between ages 12 and 23 years.",Indian Super League Shield and Cup winners Mohun Bagan Super Giant have been handed a surprise national ban on registration of new players.

PANAJI: The All India Football Federation ( AIFF ) has approached Jamshedpur FC coach Khalid Jamil with an offer to prepare the under-23 team for next year’s Asian Games and the AFC U-23 Asian Cup , qualifiers for which will be held in Sept.The AIFF wants to start early with the preparations and has identified Jamil, contracted with Jamshedpur and adjudged AIFF Coach of the Year, as the best man for the job. Should Jamil take up the job, he will be allowed to coach club and country. “The AIFF has spoken to us as well as Khalid, but nothing has been decided,” Jamshedpur CEO Mukul Choudhari told TOI on Monday. “The decision has been left to Khalid. He has to decide. His stint with us has been outstanding.”According to sources, Jamil is yet to make up his mind. AIFF officials will need to convince India’s best coach of the under-23 national team assignment’s importance.Jamil has received rich praise from all quarters after taking Jamshedpur to the playoffs in the Indian Super League (ISL), with a frugal budget. Players too have improved under his tutelage. If proof was needed that the team’s performance in the ISL – where they lost narrowly against eventual champions Mohun Bagan Super Giant in the semis – was no flash in the pan, Jamshedpur made it to the final of the Super Cup for the first time.“In terms of results, he is the best Indian coach, without any doubt,” said national team and FC Goa coach Manolo Marquez after his side defeated Jamshedpur in the Super Cup final. “People can like or not like his style of football, but the results are there. He (Jamil) was champion with Aizawl in I-League. He played the ISL playoff with Northeast United. He played the playoff this season with Jamshedpur.

Real Madrid secured a crucial 3-2 victory against Celta Vigo at the Santiago Bernabeu on Sunday, with Kylian Mbappe scoring twice to keep their La Liga title hopes alive. The win maintains their four-point gap behind leaders Barcelona ahead of next weekend's crucial El Clasico showdown.Real Madrid built a commanding three-goal lead before surviving a late comeback attempt from seventh-placed Celta Vigo, who are pursuing European qualification for next season.The hosts entered the match dealing with multiple defensive injuries but managed to overcome an early period of Celta pressure to take control of the proceedings.""The game seemed finished... you have to remember we're without six defenders and we're not always capable of solving these things,"" said Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti. ""Yes it could have been dealt with better, we suffered a bit, but it's a nice victory.""""We had a very good first half (but)... we fell apart, these things can't happen, it's happened to us a lot,"" Real Madrid midfielder Fede Valverde said on the club's television channel.

Bayern Munich were crowned German champions for the 34th time on Sunday, giving striker Harry Kane his first major trophy, after second-placed Bayer Leverkusen drew 2-2 at Freiburg.Bayern's 3-3 draw at RB Leipzig on Saturday, when the Bavarians came from two goals down to take the lead before conceding a stoppage-time equaliser, meant defending Bundesliga champions Leverkusen needed to win at Freiburg to delay the title party.Leverkusen were two goals down before scoring twice in the last 10 minutes.But Xabi Alonso's side could not find a third, as Bayern reclaimed the title at the first attempt after Leverkusen ended their 11-year reign last season.Alonso, who won three Bundesliga titles as a player with Bayern, congratulated his former club.""Congratulations to Bayern. It's a deserved championship. They were more consistent team over the season and they deserve the shield,"" Alonso said to DAZN.Kane, who had never previously won silverware, was among a group of Bayern players who gathered to watch the Leverkusen game in Munich on Sunday.The England captain was suspended for the match at Leipzig but will return this Saturday against Borussia Moenchengladbach at home, where Bayern will be presented with the Bundesliga shield at full-time.Given Bayern's far superior goal difference, Leverkusen's chances of defending their title were already all but impossible.Freiburg's Maximilian Eggestein hit a stunning goal from outside the box before half-time and Piero Hincapie was pressured into scoring an own goal just after the break.Florian Wirtz netted a spectacular solo goal with eight minutes remaining, carving through the middle of the field before firing the ball in off the post.Jonathan Tah headed Leverkusen level in stoppage time, but the visitors were unable to find the third goal which would have extended their spell as champions.The result left Leverkusen, who became the first team in history to win the title unbeaten last season, eight points behind Bayern with two games remaining.With the faint title hopes gone, Leverkusen's focus will turn to keeping hold of Alonso and Wirtz, who could both be headed for the exit in summer.Alonso has a contract at Leverkusen until 2026 but has been heavily linked with Real Madrid, where he spent five seasons as a player.Wirtz's deal expires in 2027 but the Germany midfielder is reportedly considering a big-money move to Bayern.Tah, who has already confirmed he will leave the club on a free transfer after a decade in Leverkusen, said his side had ""too little intensity, we had too few runs in behind. It didn't work today.""The Germany centre-back has been linked with moves to Barcelona and Bayern, but said ""we'll see"" where he plays next season.The late goal meant Leverkusen extended their unbeaten streak away from home to 33 games, equalling a Bundesliga record set by Bayern.The draw keeps Freiburg in fourth, one point clear of Borussia Dortmund, in the final Champions League spot. Freiburg have never played in Europe's top competition.Earlier on Sunday, Holstein Kiel won 3-1 at Augsburg, keeping their hopes of beating the drop alive.Kiel won thanks to a double from Alexander Bernhardsson and a Shuto Machino penalty and are now one point behind Heidenheim in the relegation play-off spot.In Sunday's late game, Eintracht Frankfurt can take a major step towards a top-four spot and Champions League qualification with a win at local rivals Mainz.",Bayern Munich crowned German champions for the 34th time on Sunday.

Oliver Rowland couldn’t translate his pole into victory in Monaco Round 7





There is no stopping Oliver Rowland , who had double gains at the recently held Monaco E-Prix double-header and is “really pleased” with his position in Round 7. The Nissan driver won Round 6 and had said, “Normally you’d be looking forward to the champagne, but you’ve already got one eye on tomorrow.” He did keep the champagne celebrations under control after his win in Monaco and yielded results with his podium finish the next day.Oliver Rowland had won the pole position and was confidently leading in the first half of the race, but as if the pole curse continues to be in place ever since 2022, he couldn’t manage to cross the finish line first. It was Envision Racing’s Sébastien Buemi who ended his more than six-year-long wait for a win by lifting the winner’s trophy on Day 2 of the Monaco E-Prix. Only António Félix da Costa had managed to translate his pole into a victory at the Formula E Monaco race in 2021.Sharing his take on the Monaco race, Rowland said, “I think honestly when he [Buemi] took his Attack Mode, he knew I had more to do — I think he was trying to back me into the pack, so when I took it, I lost quite a lot. But, first and second here doesn’t get much better, so I’m really, really pleased. We just need to keep pushing. We’ve got Tokyo next week where I was really strong last year, so hopefully we can have a real big push for that double-header and then keep pushing in the right direction.”Many believed Rowland was in his own race as he took a three-second lead in the first half. However, he lunged at the chicane on Lap 21, and it was Buemi who surpassed him at the right time. The Nissan driver's move was later judged over-exuberant by the stewards, forcing him to cede the position to Jean-Éric Vergne in recompense, but the damage cost the DS Penske driver a crack at the race win, as Mahindra Racing's Nyck de Vries and Buemi made it by as Vergne bogged down in avoiding action.Rowland once again gave up the lead to Vergne as he took his final mandatory 50kW, four-wheel drive Attack Mode activation, to use that overlap of extra power and traction to push past Vergne and de Vries on Laps 23 and 24 respectively, for second place at the flag, some four seconds back from Buemi.Also Read: Monaco E-Prix Round 6 winner Oliver Rowland delays celebrations for Round 7: “Normally you’d be looking forward to the champagne but…” Up next is the Tokyo double-header on May 17 and 18.

Oliver Rowland on his winning strategy

Oliver Rowland showed who’s the boss on the first day of the Monaco E-Prix . The Nissan driver went on to win the Round 6 on Saturday, registering his third win of the 2024–25 Formula E World Championship . The 32-year-old hinted that they would have been enjoying the champagne after the sweet victory but since this is a double header, the party will have to wait till Sunday. The Round 7 of the Miami E-Prix is scheduled on Sunday.Talking about his quick strategy that resulted in a win for him, Oliver Rowland said, “You never know what to do with the strategy especially with these Pit Boost races - it’s the second race but we kind of had a plan and we stuck to it. It was a bit trickier to pass Taylor [Barnard] to be honest, but we kept calm - even at the end I was pretty worried during that second Attack Mode: I dropped back to fifth and I was behind two Mahindra's, and I was like ‘right now we need to get cracking’, but great job by the team and very well executed.”The 32-year-old added, “I was thinking Taylor was pushing the barriers of the rules at some points, but fair play to him - in the end we got the job done so it doesn’t really matter. We’ve started the season really well, but it feels a bit different now. Normally you’d be looking forward to the champagne but you’ve already got one eye on tomorrow.”A key factor in Rowland's success was the strategic deployment of Pit Boost by Nissan, allowing him to overtake polesitter NEOM McLaren driver Taylor Barnard on Lap 13. Despite briefly losing the lead to Mahindra Racing’s Nyck de Vries on Lap 26, Rowland masterfully utilised his final Attack Mode on Lap 27 to reclaim the lead, ultimately winning the race by a comfortable two-second margin.Also Read: Monaco E-Prix Round 6: Oliver Rowland wins, Nyck de Vries second, Jake Dennis secures third spot on podium despite penalty Rowland is currently on top of the FIA Drivers' World Championship standings with 94 points.

NEW DELHI: India captain Rohit Sharma downplayed worries about his fitness on Sunday after taking an unplanned break during his team's six-wicket victory over Pakistan in a pivotal Champions Trophy group A match in Dubai.It appeared that Rohit had injured his hamstring as he was observed straining during fielding. At the presentation ceremony, the captain, who also briefly left the field during the Pakistan innings, responded that he was ""okay"" when questioned about his hamstring.""Hamstring's okay at the moment,"" the 37-year-old said in the presentation ceremony following the win that has almost clinched a semifinal slot for India. Virat Kohli , who reached his 51st ODI century with the game-winning boundary down the off-side, was clearly the day's star, even if the bowlers set the stage by dismissing Pakistan for 241.Rohit lavished his longtime India teammate with admiration.""Virat loves representing the country, doing what he does the best, which is what he did today. People sitting inside the dressing room aren't surprised with what he did,"" Rohit said.With Kohli fewer than ten runs from reaching his century and India drawing closer to victory, Rohit was spotted urging the star batsman to reach the milestone with a few big hits.Rohit said all the players did what was required of them.""We started superbly with the ball. We knew wicket could get slower but backed our experienced batters to go out there and get 240. Credit goes to Kuldeep, Axar, Jadeja who have played a lot.""(Mohammad) Rizwan and Saud (Shakeel) stitched a good stand, it was important not to let the game drift. Not to forget how (Mohammed) Shami, Hardik (Pandya), and Harshit (Rana) bowled as well. It was a good performance from the entire unit. Boys understand what kind of job is required out of them.""It's tricky at times because not all will get to bowl. I try to figure out who's creating the most problems to the batters and make decisions,"" Rohit said.Pakistan captain Muhammad Rizwan claimed that bad shot selection hurt their cause after they chose to bat first and urged fielding to be improved.""We won the toss, but we didn't get the benefit of toss. Their bowlers bowled very well. Me and Saud Shakeel , we wanted to take it deep. But our shot selection was bad and we lost wickets, which is why we were kept to 240,"" Rizwan said.Tournament hosts Pakistan's second loss in the competition puts them in danger of being eliminated.Rizwan added, ""They put us under pressure. Whenever you lose, you didn't perform in all departments. We wanted to squeeze, but we couldn't.""Kohli and Gill batted very well and took the game away. We need to improve in our fielding. We did a lot of mistakes in this match."" Shubman Gill was dismissed for 46 by spinner Abrar Ahmed , who said he did not regret sending the Indian batsman out in a heated fashion. Ahmed said he attempted to maintain discipline.""It's not an issue. I celebrate the same way even when I get wickets in Pakistan. Match is about winning and losing,"" said Abrar, who finished with impressive figures of 1/28 in 10 overs.Additionally, he claimed that batting in the second innings was easier.""The wicket was much better to bat in the second innings. First innings, it offered some help to the bowlers.""""Only Allah knows what lies in store for us,"" Abrar said when asked about the disappointment of losing to their traditional rivals yet again.",India captain Rohit Sharma downplays worries about his fitness after taking unplanned break.

New Zealand vs Bangladesh: A decisive clash

EXCLUSIVE | Rohit Sharma way better than Virat Kohli and Babar Azam: Former Pakistan pacer

NEW DELHI: Star batter Virat Kohli produced a vintage knock, scoring an unbeaten 100 to steer India to a dominant six-wicket victory over Pakistan in the ICC Champions Trophy . Kohli’s match-winning century pushed the defending champions Pakistan to the brink of elimination, leaving them reliant on Bangladesh to keep their hopes alive.Chasing 242, India lost Rohit Sharma (20) early to Shaheen Afridi, but a solid 69-run stand between Kohli and Shubman Gill (46) ensured stability. Kohli played a measured innings, becoming only the third player to surpass 14,000 ODI runs, following legends Sachin Tendulkar (18,426) and Kumar Sangakkara (14,234). His 51st ODI century, reached in 111 balls, sealed the match with 45 balls to spare, propelling India to the top of Group A with two wins in two games.""My job was to control the middle overs and take on the pacers later,"" Kohli said post-match. ""It's about managing expectations, keeping my energy levels in check, and focusing on my game.""With India virtually sealing their semifinal spot, attention now shifts to the crucial New Zealand vs Bangladesh clash on Monday. The Black Caps, who defeated Pakistan by 60 runs in their opener, will secure qualification with a win. Their strong net run rate (1.200) gives them an edge.Bangladesh, reeling from a six-wicket loss to India, face a must-win scenario. Their net run rate (-0.408) leaves them in a vulnerable position, and a defeat would knock them out. Bangladesh’s batting lineup, which struggled against India, must step up against New Zealand’s formidable pace attack.New Zealand, meanwhile, face a selection dilemma with Rachin Ravindra potentially returning from injury. The Kiwis will look to continue their clinical performances and avoid any surprises, knowing that Bangladesh stunned them in the 2017 edition to knock them out.If New Zealand win, Pakistan will be eliminated, and the semifinalists from Group A will be confirmed. However, if Bangladesh triumph, the group will remain wide open, making for an intense final round of matches.","Virat Kohli scores unbeaten 100 to guide India to six-wicket victory over Pakistan.

NEW DELHI: Pakistan captain Mohammad Rizwan said that his team's hopes of winning the Champions Trophy had ""ended"" following a devastating defeat to fierce rivals India on Sunday.Hosts Pakistan almost got eliminated from the race for the semi-finals after losing by six wickets in Dubai for their second loss in the 50-over competition.Pakistan's destiny will be decided if New Zealand defeat Bangladesh in Rawalpindi on Monday.""Yes, I would say it has ended, that's the truth,"" Rizwan told reporters when asked if his side had reached the end of the road.""The next match, what Bangladesh does with New Zealand and what New Zealand does with India. What we do? It's a long journey. Our Champions Trophy depends on others and I as a captain I don't like this.""""If we could have done something on our own then it would have been different.

""Abrar Ahmed's bowling was a positive but we made mistakes in all three departments."" Khushdil Shah made 38 after Saud, who struck 62, and Rizwan, who made 46, left the middle order stuttering.""Our middle-order has performed before and 270-280 would have been good on this pitch,"" said Rizwan.""I tried to build a partnership and took some time as well, we lost wickets and our shot selection was poor. In turn our middle-order crumbled.""Rizwan claimed that mistakes are being made again after Pakistan's defeat to New Zealand in the tournament's opening match.""Honestly we made the same mistakes that we have been doing since the last three-four matches,"" the wicketkeeper-batsman said.""We are working on them but we are mortals and falling short.

NEW DELHI: India's Champions Trophy triumph over Pakistan by six wickets on Sunday was described by Shreyas Iyer as ""sweet"" because it was against a team that was very competitive and required fending off numerous ""external pressures.""With this victory, India all but guaranteed a spot in the ICC showcase semifinals, and Iyer was instrumental in it with a timely 56 off 67 balls.""I haven't played that many matches in Pakistan, so I don't know exactly how it would have felt. But it's a neutral venue and it's a challenge for both the teams. But any victory against Pakistan is sweet because they are always competitive,"" Iyer told reporters in the post-match press conference in Dubai.""It's a challenge and there's a lot of pressure externally as well. It was a lot of fun. It was my third game in Pakistan,"" he added but did not elaborate what exactly he meant by external pressure.Iyer praised his senior teammate for reaching a century with ease. Iyer and Virat Kohli formed a crucial 114-run partnership for the third wicket.In addition to scoring 14000 runs in the format during the knock, Kohli also hit his 51st ODI century.""I have never thought of Virat struggling for runs. It is just the mindset that he possesses over the years. He is always hungry for runs. I remember yesterday, he had come almost an hour before us for the practice session and he played a few balls and he was looking from outside.""He looked as crisp as he looks all the time. So, I never feel that he is struggling for his runs,"" he said.The Mumbaikar also eased worries about injuries to veteran pacer Mohammed Shami and captain Rohit Sharma , who both had to miss some part of Pakistan's innings.""As far as I know, both Rohit and Shami are fine. There is no injury concern to them,"" he said.Iyer had a two-layered innings, first concentrating on singles and then opening up to punish the Pakistan bowlers.The 30-year-old gave an explanation of the reasoning for his strategy.""See, it is clear as sweeps and reverse sweeps cannot be played straightaway. But rotating the strike is going to be important because that puts a decent amount of pressure on the bowlers.""They keep changing their line lengths. And once you keep taking singles, the bowlers are more under pressure and you can keep hitting the scoreboard from there on,"" he added.On his aggressive approach in the latter part of the innings, Iyer said: ""I love to take on the bowlers when we are under pressure. And that is my mindset. If we take charge, if we gain the momentum towards us, then it is easy to steady the ship.""And from there on, the rest of the batsmen, when they come in, it becomes easy for them.""Iyer praised the Indian spinners for keeping the Pakistani batsmen quiet in the middle overs.""They bowled tremendously, especially in the middle phase where the ball was turning. As we know, even in the previous game when we played over here, the wicket is a bit slow.""It's spinner friendly and the way they have been bowling consistently over a period of time, I think the amalgamation of all three bowlers mixing up quite well, also the experience that they possess. I think that brings a lot of clarity in their bowling,"" he said.","Shreyas Iyer describes India's Champions Trophy win over Pakistan as ""sweet"" India all but guaranteed a spot in the ICC showcase semifinals.

Especially when you are in the title race, it is incredible,"" said Salah after Liverpool's first league win at the Etihad for a decade.""Me and the big guys in the team, we need another title.""This was another heartbreaking loss for the deposed English champions, who are currently 20 points behind the top, only days after losing to Real Madrid in the Champions League Throughout Pep Guardiola 's illustrious leadership, Liverpool has frequently failed in the great rivalry of English football in recent years.However, in Arne Slot's first season as manager, it currently looks as though they will be able to break Manchester United 's record of 20 English top-flight titles in a matter of months.""We work every single day to achieve this and it is three months of very hard work (ahead) to maintain this,"" said Slot.""It is important to understand why we are where we are.""The pressure on Liverpool, which had increased after they lost two of their previous three games at Everton and Aston Villa, was reduced by Arsenal's shocking 1-0 home loss to West Ham on Saturday.The hardest test of all has traditionally been a trip to the Etihad, but City's defensive weaknesses were readily shown, and they also missed the injured Erling Haaland 's offensive presence.In contrast, Liverpool's star was healthy and playing well, as Salah increased his incredible season total to 25 goals and 16 assists in 27 Premier League games.The Egyptian's masterfully performed set-piece move put the visitors ahead in the 14th minute.Szoboszlai flicked Alexis Mac Allister's corner into Salah's path, and his shot ducked off Nathan Ake and beyond Ederson's dejected dive.Omar Marmoush had gone offside before Phil Foden brought him in, but City's own Egyptian international shown his ability to finish at the other end.Trent Alexander-Arnold was being skipped past by City winger Jeremy Doku at will, but the Belgian kept missing with a telling cross or strike.When he sprinted onto a long ball over the top and teed up Szoboszlai to wrong-foot Ederson, Salah was not so understanding.If Liverpool had been equally accurate on the counterattack after the half, the ultimate result may have been far more humiliating for City.A VAR review disallowed Curtis Jones' third goal for offside after Szoboszlai's run through the center of the City defense was just not timed.Only an incredible last-ditch tackle by Abdukodir Khusanov stopped Szoboszlai a second goal, and Ederson was forced into a spectacular save by Luis Diaz.In last weekend's 4-0 victory over Newcastle, Marmoush scored a hat-trick and continued to be a dangerous threat by putting another effort in front of Alisson Becker's goal.However, City didn't produce enough to reach the 70 percent possession mark.Despite suffering their eighth league loss of the year, Guardiola's team is still in fourth place and will be sure to qualify for the Champions League the next year, as a top-five finish is probably sufficient.However, City now looks like yesterday's club following an incredible run of four straight victories, with Liverpool emerging as the new champions.",Liverpool beat Manchester City 2-0 at the Etihad Stadium.

Champions Trophy 2025: India, Pakistan apply final touches before blockbuster

NEW DELHI: Indian batting stalwart Virat Kohli delivered a masterclass -- powered by a century -- as India crushed Pakistan in a one-sided ICC Champions Trophy 2025 Group A clash at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium on Sunday.Chasing a modest target of 242, India eased to victory with six wickets in hand.Opting to bat first, Pakistan got off to a shaky start as Babar Azam (23) edged Hardik Pandya to KL Rahul in the ninth over.Imam-ul-Haq (10) was run out soon after, leaving Pakistan struggling at 47/2. A resilient 104-run stand between Saud Shakeel (62) and skipper Mohammad Rizwan (46) stabilised the innings, but India’s bowlers struck back strongly. Axar Patel removed Rizwan in the 35th over, and Shakeel followed soon after, falling to Hardik Pandya. Wickets continued to tumble as Tayyab Tahir (4), Salman Agha (19), and Shaheen Afridi (0) departed cheaply, leaving Pakistan at 200/7 in the 43rd over.A late fightback from Khushdil Shah (38) pushed the total to 241, but it was never enough against India’s dominant batting lineup.Kuldeep Yadav (3/40) was the pick of the Indian bowlers, while Pandya (2/31), Axar Patel, and Ravindra Jadeja made crucial breakthroughs to restrict Pakistan.India’s chase began on a solid note, with captain Rohit Sharma (20) providing a brisk start before being dismissed by Shaheen Afridi. Shubman Gill anchored the innings with a well-crafted 46 before falling to Abrar Ahmed.However, it was Virat Kohli’s sublime knock of 100 not out that stole the show.Displaying impeccable timing and composure, Kohli ensured India never lost control of the chase. He found an able partner in Shreyas Iyer (56), who played an attacking knock before falling to Khushdil Shah.Hardik Pandya’s quick cameo (8) ended with Rizwan taking a sharp catch off Shaheen Afridi, but Kohli remained unbeaten, guiding India home comfortably.Axar Patel (3 not out) was at the other end as Kohli wrapped up the chase with a boundary to complete his deserving century against the arch-rivals.With this emphatic victory, India have put one foot in the tournament’s semi-finals, further asserting their dominance in the competition.","India beat Pakistan by six wickets in Champions Trophy 2025 Group A clash.

Champions Trophy: Shubman Gill identifies where India-Pakistan could be won or lost

Expressing surprise over the downfall of Pakistan cricket , former India off-spinner said that there is no comparison between the current Pakistan team and the ones that played till 2011-12.The archrivals are set to renew their rivalry in Dubai on Sunday when they meet in a group-stage fixture of the ICC Champions Trophy In the build-up to the big game, Harbhajan featured as a guest on a Pakistan news channel, alongside Pakistan legends Mohammad Yousuf and Shahid Afridi Harbhajan said the lack of unity in the current Pakistan squad is disappointing.""Haven't seen such a Pakistan team in years,"" he said. ""When we used to play Pakistan, there was always a feeling that the opposition could beat you because they had star players, power-packed performers, bowling was very good and the unity showed. This (current) team may have players who can win a game on their own, but that unity isn't evident.""They have individuals who can win a game on their day. But a team should have 7-8 such players who can win you the championship. I don't see that in this team. That's my opinion.""Pakistan defeated India in the final of the last Champions Trophy in 2017 with a commanding 180-run victory. But since that defeat, India haven't lost to Pakistan.In six matches played since the 2017 Champions Trophy final at The Oval, India have won five, while one ended as a no-result.""No doubt you won in 2017 when Fakhar Zaman played that big innings. But somewhere, I think, there is a lot of difference now from the days when India and Pakistan used to be nicely balanced teams. Now India is ahead of Pakistan,"" Harbhajan added.Concurring with Harbhajan, Afridi said now Pakistan lack match-winners who can take them all the way to winning titles.""Bhajji is right. We can't compare this team with the one from the '90s. They are now short of match-winners. Like Bhajji said, you can win a match but to lift the trophy you need (consistent) match-winners. Mindset against the top team is the most important thing,"" said the former Pakistan captain.The two teams started their Champions Trophy campaign in contrasting fashion. Pakistan lost the tournament opener to New Zealand by 60 runs, while India defeated Bangladesh by six wickets.As a result, Pakistan are in a virtual must-win situation with just a match against Bangladesh left to play after this in Group A.The eight-team competition will see top two teams from each of the two groups qualifying for the semifinals.","Former India off-spinner Harbhajan says current Pakistan team lacks unity.

Champions Trophy EXCLUSIVE: India, Pakistan prepare for blockbuster in Dubai

Excitement is set to reach its crescendo when India and Pakistan resume their rivalry on Sunday in a Group A match of the Champions Trophy , and it could be felt in the voice of former Pakistan batter Ahmed Shehzad as he previewed the big clash on his YouTube channel.On current form, India are the overwhelming favourites, which is unlike India vs Pakistan matches historically. But the unpredictable nature of the Pakistan team always remains a threat.While Shehzad admitted that the Indian team is far superior to Pakistan currently, he said they could be in trouble if Pakistan bowlers are able to bring the Indian all-rounders early to the crease.""It will be important for India's top four to play 35-40 overs. You may go for attack early on but if you lose three wickets inside the first 15 overs, then there are a lot of allrounders lower down in India's line-up,"" Shehzad said.All-rounders Hardik Pandya, Axar Patel and Ravindra Jadeja form the core of India's middle order, which makes Shehzad believe that Pakistan will be in the game if they can dismiss the likes of Rohit Sharma , Shubman Gill, Virat Kohli and Shreyas Iyer early.""It (having all-rounders in the eleven) can work for you in T20Is, like Rohit Sharma says it adds depth to the line-up. But the captain would know that if you lose early wickets in ODIs, you have to plan your innings; to reach the desired target, you need proper batters. That game-awareness the all-rounders may not have,"" Shehzad analysed.""Agar Pakistan pehla punch maarne mei kamyab ho gaya aur jaldi teen wickets le li, India ke all-rounders ko jaldi game mei le aaya, toh Pakistan yeh bahut bada kaam karega (if Pakistan manage to throw the first punch and take three early wickets to bring India's all-rounders in early, that will be a big job done).""However, Shehzad also issued a warning to the Pakistan bowlers, saying that a Virat Kohli special is around the corner and it might come on Sunday.""Virat Kohli played a good knock against England in tough conditions (52 in third ODI at Ahmedabad). When you are short of runs and you come up with such an innings, then your feet (movement), body language, all those things fall in place and help, which will be very good from Virat's point of view,"" he said.""He is such a player who plays a magical innings in a big match. Remember how he snatched the match out of Pakistan's jaws last time.""Having lost their first match against New Zealand, Pakistan are in a virtual must-win situation against India, who are coming into this match with a convincing six-wicket win over Bangladesh.Top two teams from each of the two groups qualify for the semifinals.","Former Pakistan batter Ahmed Shehzad previewed the big clash on his YouTube channel.

Champions Trophy EXCLUSIVE: India, Pakistan prepare for blockbuster in Dubai

EXCLUSIVE | Rohit Sharma way better than Virat Kohli and Babar Azam: Former Pakistan pacer

As Pakistan prepare for their high-stakes Champions Trophy showdown against India on Sunday, former Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chief and cricketer Ramiz Raja believes their underdog status could work to their advantage.In his column for Dawn, Raja suggested that India's top-order vulnerabilities and strategic bowling adjustments could open the door for a Pakistan upset at the Dubai International Stadium .""India already have a victory under their belt, beating Bangladesh in their first game. Pakistan, desperate to get off the mark, will enter the much-awaited game as the underdogs. But that can actually be an advantage because it allows them to play without much pressure,"" Raja stated.Pakistan suffered a 60-run defeat against New Zealand in their opening game, leaving them in a must-win situation. However, Raja noted that India's batting mainstays, Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli , are not in top form.""India's batting mainstays Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli are not currently in great form, and if Shubman Gill -- who scored a century to guide India to victory against Bangladesh -- gets out early, Pakistan will have a good chance to slow down India's scoring,"" he said.Raja highlighted their failure to rotate the strike effectively, pointing to the staggering 145 dot balls while chasing 320. ""The top order often takes too long to start scoring and taking risks, worrying about getting out. This fearful mindset hinders the team's ability to set or chase targets,"" he observed.Pakistan's bowling attack also needs a sharper approach. Raja criticised their pace bowlers for lacking variety and control under pressure. ""Where are the yorkers, the slower bouncers, or subtle variations? The spinners have been bowling too fast and defensively. That will need to change,"" he warned.Despite Pakistan's early setback, Raja remains optimistic. ""It wasn't the ideal start, but when playing against India, Pakistan often rise to the occasion and play with great passion for their country and fans. However, it is also important for them to stay calm under pressure and effectively follow their bowling plans, especially in the final stages of the match.""With a sold-out stadium expected to be dominated by Indian supporters, Raja sees the pressure as a potential motivator for Pakistan. ""On Sunday, there will be added pressure. The stadium will be packed with more Indian fans than Pakistan fans. It would be a great day to win against the odds!"" he concluded.","Pakistan face India in their Champions Trophy clash on Sunday. Ramiz Raja believes Pakistan's underdog status could work to their advantage. India already have a victory under their belt, beating Bangladesh in their first game. Pakistan suffered a 60-run defeat against New Zealand in their opening game.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118498676,imgsize-123568,width-400,resizemode-4/118498676.jpg"

Pakistan team trains ahead of Champions Trophy clash vs India | EXCLUSIVE VISUALS

After a defeat in the tournament opener, Pakistan's hopes of progressing in the Champions Trophy hinge heavily on their next group match against traditional rivals India in Dubai on Sunday, which former Pakistan cricketer Basit Ali views as heavily loaded in favour of India.New Zealand outclassed defending champions and hosts Pakistan by 60 runs in the first match of the tournament at Karachi, while India beat Bangladesh by six wickets in Dubai.Talking about Pakistan's chances and their must-win situation, Basit said it will be a big upset if Pakistan get the better of India.""It is a 'final' for Pakistan,"" the former batter said on his YouTube channel. ""India are heavy favourites. If Pakistan win, it will be an upset in my view because Pakistan's cricket has gone down, hit a low.""Agar one-sided hota hai, toh ab TV bhi nahi tootenge kyuki Pakistan mei mehangai boht zyada hai. Ab zabaan se hi har cheez hogi (if Pakistan lose one-sided, now fans wont' break TV sets because of the country's economic situation; now there will be only voiced opinions).""The hosts suffered a blow after the defeat against the Kiwis, losing their attacking batter Fakhar Zaman to injury, which led to Imam-ul-Haq coming in as replacement""Who will bat at No. 3, nobody knows. They might ask Usman Khan to open with Imam and bring Babar (Azam) at No. 3. Something needs to be done,"" Basit added, talking about the team's dire state.Babar has been opening since the ODI tri-series at home ahead of the Champions Trophy and was criticised for his laborious 64 off 90 balls in the first match of the Champions Trophy despite a target of 321 to chase.""Fakhar Zaman is out. Now Pakistan's batting line-up from number one to five is similar and there is no scope to swap positions. It's true. If their car is running in third gear, then it will stay in third gear. It won't be able to switch to turbo, maybe in the last 5 or 10 overs, maybe,"" said Basit.India, meanwhile, put up an all-round show against Bangladesh to start their campaign on a rousing note, with Mohammed Shami shining with a five-wicket spell (5 for 53) and opener Shubman Gill scoring an unbeaten century (101*).Basit said India will continue to play normal cricket and take it like just another match, while the mentality in Pakistan is still to beat India at any cost.""Baaton ki cricket ab nahi hone chahiye, ab bat se, dimag se (Pakistan now need to make their bats talk, use their brain),"" he said.Captain Rohit Sharma, who scored a century during the ODI series at home against England to return to form, looked good in his 36-ball 41 against Bangladesh, while Virat Kohli had to struggle for his 22, which came off 38 balls.""Virat intezar karta hai Pakistan ke match ka (Virat waits for the match against Pakistan),"" said Basit, predicting that the batting legend may play a big knock in the pressure match.He concluded by criticising the Pakistan Cricket Board for the money it spent in refurbishing the three stadiums in Lahore, Karachi and Rawalpindi.He said the board should instead have applied its mind in building a team.""The amount of money they spent in building the stadiums, they could have built a good team in half that amount. But to build a team you need intelligence. What is your vision? What's your thinking? How do you view a player's talent and longevity? These things matter.""As things stand at the moment in Group A, New Zealand are on top with two points, with India at No.2 because the Kiwis have a better net run-rate (NRR) of +1.200 compared to India's +0.408.Bangladesh are ahead of bottom-placed Pakistan. Both the teams are without any points, while Bangladesh's NRR of -0.408 is better than Pakistan's -1.200.",Basit Ali says it will be a big upset if Pakistan get the better of India.

National anthem gaffe in Lahore

PCB's complaint over missing 'Pakistan' watermark

Flag controversy at Karachi's National Stadium

EXCLUSIVE | Rohit Sharma way better than Virat Kohli and Babar Azam: Former Pakistan pacer

As the ICC Champions Trophy 2025 gains momentum after the first round of matches, off-field controversies and administrative blunders have taken center stage.From anthem mix-ups to broadcast issues and flag controversies, the tournament has been overshadowed by multiple embarrassing incidents.In a major embarrassment for the tournament organisers, the Indian national anthem was mistakenly played before the start of the England-Australia league match at Gaddafi Stadium in Lahore. The anthem was heard for a few seconds after England’s “God Save the King”, disrupting the usual sequence of pre-match ceremonies. The Australian anthem was then played as scheduled.The ICC and PCB attributed the blunder to an event management agency responsible for handling match-day proceedings. However, the mistake was widely criticised on social media, with fans and experts questioning the professionalism of the organisers.The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) and the ICC were also at odds over a technical issue during the broadcast of the India-Bangladesh game. The PCB raised concerns about the absence of 'Pakistan' in the watermark branding on the live feed, an anomaly not seen in any other matches.After PCB's protest, the ICC acknowledged the error and agreed to restore the three-line branding format that includes 'Pakistan' in all subsequent broadcasts. The tournament's production team, Sunset+Vine, cited a formatting issue and promised to rectify it from the next match onward.The Champions Trophy's off-field troubles began even before the first ball was bowled, as a social media controversy erupted over the alleged absence of the Indian flag at Karachi's National Stadium. A video circulating online showed the flags of various participating nations, but India's flag was notably missing, sparking accusations that the PCB was deliberately excluding.The PCB quickly dismissed these claims, clarifying that flags were only hoisted for teams playing in Pakistan. Since India's matches were scheduled in Dubai due to political tensions, PCB officials defended their decision to not display the Indian flag at Karachi and Lahore stadiums.However, the Indian flag appeared on the match day along with all other participating nations' flags when Pakistan hosted New Zealand for the opening match in Karachi.While on-field battles continue, the tournament's credibility has taken a hit due to repeated administrative lapses. Organisers now face the challenge of ensuring a smoother run for the remaining matches to shift the focus back to the game.",Indian national anthem mistakenly played before start of England-Australia league match in Lahore.

(Photo by Sajjad Hussain/AFP via Getty Images)

The world's best fast bowler fashioned India's wins in their last two WC matches, across formats, against the arch-rivals. Pakistan will be relieved that the magical Bumrah is missing this time around

It was October 14, 2023, the much-hyped World Cup group match between India and Pakistan at a supercharged Ahmedabad stadium. Having frittered away a decent start, Pakistan were 168/5 in the 34th over. Looking shaky, the visitors were banking heavily on their star 'keeper-bat Mohammed Rizwan, who was batting on a fluent 49, to take them to a decent total.That was when Jasprit Bumrah , with a packed house of 120,000 spectators cheering for him, ran in to bowl to Rizwan. Unleashing a slow off-cutter, Bumrah left a clueless Rizwan's stumps in a mess. The massive crowd roared 'Boom, Boom, Bumrah'! The atmosphere was electric. In one fell swoop, Bumrah had outwitted Pakistan's batting mainstay.Next over, Bumrah made things worse for Pakistan, uprooting Shadab Khan's off-stump with one that straightened. Tottering at 171/7 in the 36th over after Bumrah's strikes, Pakistan folded for 191 by the 43rd over. They went on to lose the match by 7 wickets.Cut to the next India-Pakistan clash, this time in New York on June 9 in the 2024 T20 World Cup. Defending just 119, India looked in dire straits, with Pakistan having coasted to 26 by the fifth over. Again, in came Bumrah, and promptly got Pakistan captain Babar Azam to nick one outside off-stump to first slip. Babar didn't know whether to play or leave. India had tasted first blood.However, Pakistan bounced back, and with Rizwan (31) once again holding fort, reached 80/3 in the 15th over. Now they were surely the favourites? That was when Rizwan committed the cardinal sin - he swung across the line, hoping to hit Bumrah out of the park. The delivery had moved back in and wasn't there for the shot. It was perhaps a little too full, and flattened Rizwan's stumps instead. India heaved a sigh of relief. Their pace talisman had delivered again.Soon after, Bumrah got the dangerous Iftikhar Ahmed with a full toss, caught superbly by Arshdeep Singh running in from fine leg. The match had swung back India's way. Bumrah finished with figures of 3/14 off his four overs, justifiably bagging the 'Player of the Match' award.With the difficult New York pitch making it almost impossible to play him, Bumrah had singlehandedly fashioned India's thrilling six-run triumph in a low-scoring encounter.This time in Dubai, Pakistan will heave a sigh of relief that Bumrah is absent from India's lineup. Seeing his form in Australia, one wonders how the ace pacer would have fared had there been a full Test series played against Pakistan. A fit Bumrah's presence in the Champions Trophy would have surely made India formidable opponents.Ex-India pacer Salil Ankola, who was a national selector till last year, believes Bumrah's no-show leaves the entire Champions Trophy - not just the Indian team - poorer.""Why just the Indian team? The whole cricketing world will miss a world-class bowler like Jasprit Bumrah in the Champions Trophy,"" Ankola said.""What he brings to the table is a totally different thing - magic. The angle at which he bowls, the whip of the wrist at the last minute makes it very difficult for the batter. Bumrah can extract nip off the surface even on a dead track where others might struggle. Even if there's only 10% help from the wicket, he can run through a side. For the last four-five years, we've depended heavily on him. Jasprit has always been our mainstay, our go-to man,"" added Ankola.The 56-year-old was of the view that India could have managed Bumrah's workload better in Australia, ensuring that he stayed fit for the Champions Trophy. ""If there was a fear over his breakdown, then his workload should've been managed better in Australia, where he bowled the most number of overs across both teams in the series. He has to be treated with care,"" Ankola said.",Jasprit Bumrah's no-show in Champions Trophy leaves the entire cricketing world poorer. Ex-India pacer Salil Ankola believes the world's best fast bowler would have made India formidable opponents in the tournament.

Mohammad Amir Exclusive: Champions Trophy hopes, India's absence & retirement talk

NEW DELHI: Former India captain Sourav Ganguly believes KL Rahul 's ""fantastic numbers"" in ODIs may have given him the edge over Rishabh Pant as India's first-choice wicketkeeper-batter in the ongoing Champions Trophy.Head coach Gautam Gambhir backed Rahul to take on the wicketkeeping duties for the marquee ICC event, leaving Pant on the sidelines.""India are such a strong side, especially in batting. Pant is very good. But Rahul has fantastic numbers in ODIs. So, I think that's the reason Gautam Gambhir has backed Rahul,"" Ganguly said after he was announced as the brand ambassador of Vura, a construction chemical brand.""There's very little to choose between them (Rahul and Pant) because both are exceptional,"" he added.The former BCCI chief also backed Virat Kohli to overcome his leg-spin woes, while tipping India as favourites to bag the Champions Trophy title.""India have five Shubman Gills from one, two, three, four, five, six -- who can all score hundreds and win matches. When Axar Patel bats at five for India, can you imagine the depth?""Yesterday, India was in a spot of bother, but then they had KL Rahul coming in. They had Ravindra Jadeja, Hardik Pandya... There's batting after batting.""India have a house of talent because of the systems we have and the way we play our cricket.""Kohli once again fell to a leg-spinner but Ganguly was confident that the star batter will overcome this challenge.""The quality of cricketer Virat Kohli is ---I'm sure he will be able to sort this out. He has got 81 international hundreds, and I'm sure he scored runs against leg-spin also. So, it was probably just one of those days when he got out. He has to find a way to play it.""While India and New Zealand are Ganguly's picks from Group A, he said Australia could miss out on the semifinals due to the absence of key players.""New Zealand have beaten Pakistan. So, New Zealand is ahead. If India beat Pakistan, then Pakistan will probably be out of the competition. So, I see India and New Zealand progressing from this group.""""From the other group, I'm a little worried about Australia because there's no (Pat) Cummins, no Mitchell Starc, and no Josh Hazlewood. Their three best fast bowlers are missing.""Between South Africa, England, and Australia -- any two can qualify. You never count Australia out because of their pedigree and the quality of cricket they play. But I won't be surprised if England and South Africa make it.""The 52-year-old, who has a career best 239 in Tests against Pakistan, also remembered his on-field fights against the neighbours.""I've played an entire lifetime of India-Pakistan cricket, starting from the Independence Cup final in 1996. My first series as captain toPakistan in 2004, where India won the Tests and ODIs for the first time in history. So, I have lots of great memories of playing against Pakistan.""I've seen Javed Miandad's six sixes, and I've also seen the transformation of India after that -- how we started dominating Pakistan in every format.""I say that with respect. India have been a far, far superior team. Looking at this Indian team, it's also far, far superior in the last 20 years,"" he said.","Sourav Ganguly believes KL Rahul has the edge over Rishabh Pant as India's first-choice wicketkeeper-batter in the ongoing Champions Trophy.

Poll Will Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli Shine Against Pakistan? No, It Will Be a Tough Challenge Yes, They Will Rise to the Occasion

Champions Trophy EXCLUSIVE: India, Pakistan prepare for blockbuster in Dubai

""We are different countries. We have different jerseys. But the game only knows the basics. You reap the rewards of hard work. It's the environment within the stadium that elevates your performance, and that's exactly the case when we play against Pakistan, more than any other team,"" says India great Virat Kohli - in a video released by the official broadcasters - while talking about the game against Pakistan on February 23 in Dubai.Political correctness isn't Kohli's forte. He doesn't hide behind 'it's-just-another-game' platitudes. He loves the hype and the big-game pressure whenever India play Pakistan. His numbers against Pakistan prove it: 16 ODIs, 678 runs, avg 52.15, strike-rate 100.29.Intensity? 10,000 units. Examples? Mirpur (2012), Adelaide (2015), Colombo (2023), Birmingham (2017). Clutch checklist? 23-10-22, T20 World Cup, Melbourne. Making the impossible possible? Over 18.5. THAT shot against Haris Rauf. T20 WC performance vs Pak? 6 matches, 312 runs, avg 156, strike-rate 132.Don't watch the stroke for its remarkable execution. Don't track the trajectory of the ball after its appointment with the middle of Kohli's willow. Zoom into the batter's eyes. Hear his heart pound.But before every act of heroism, there is misplaced early bravado. Pakistan were Kohli's first opponents in ICC events at Centurion in the 2009 Champions Trophy. And his inside-out shot against Shahid Afridi , which landed in the juggling palms of Umar Gul at long off, still haunts him since it derailed India's chase. He vowed to become a 'chasemaster' after that, ticking that bucket list innumerable times.However, two of India's three defeats to Pakistan in the Champions Trophy have come in Kohli's era. The last one was in 2017, a humiliating 180-run mauling in the final at the Oval when Kohli was captain. India were favourites but imploded against a freakish Fakhar Zaman, who scored a century, and an inspired opening burst with the ball from Mohammed Amir.Conspiracy theorists also attributed the loss to a revolt against the coach. It was also under Kohli's leadership that Pakistan broke their winless streak in World Cups against India, winning by 10 wickets in Dubai in the 2021 T20 World Cup.Kohli would want to set some records straight here. He also has some self-doubt to slay after his troubles in red-ball cricket and all the trolling he has endured.Clouds of apprehension have also circled around skipper Rohit Sharma's head. With his famed hand-eye coordination showing signs of slackening, the ability to judge length early has also vaporized. It has resulted in his form in Tests showing an alarming dip, triggering tame dismissals at home and in Australia.The red flag is up for him, especially in the longest format. But his form in white-ball cricket has been excellent. Ever since he adopted and communicated the need to embrace a high-risk, high-reward strategy in the Powerplay, Rohit has helped in giving the team a massive launchpad to go big while batting first. In pursuit of targets, he has managed to break the back of big chases and make the equation easier for the rest of the batters.Rohit has a fabulous record against Pakistan. In 19 matches, he has scored 873 runs, averaging 51.35 with two tons and eight half-centuries.The last time the two teams met in 50-overs cricket, in Dubai, he was leading in the 2018 Asia Cup and stroked an unbeaten 111. His 140 in Manchester on a gloomy Sunday in the 2019 World Cup was a masterclass in taking the game on. The slashed six off Hasan Ali over deep point evoked comparisons with the great Sachin Tendulkar 's storied upper cut off Shoaib Akhtar in Centurion in 2003.Rohit also belted a 63-ball 86 that demoralized the men-in-green in 2023 in Ahmedabad, putting on a tutorial in how to pull high-pace deliveries into the galleries.But he has fallen victim to left arm pace and the ball swinging in from over the wicket. Shaheen Shah Afridi got him LBW with a deadly yorker in the 2021 T20 World Cup. Mohammed Amir did the same in the 2016 Asia Cup in Mirpur and the 2017 Champions Trophy final at the Oval.The Cuttack hundred against England has enabled Rohit to keep the doubters away for a while. Another attacking and authoritative knock against Mohammed Rizwan and Co. could help him increase that distance.'RoKo' as a hashtag is popular but superficial and an attempt to hyphenate the careers and achievements of the two Indian batting superstars. A combined effort from the two veterans, though, may not just help India win another global trophy, but it may also enable toxic fans of Rohit and Kohli to co-exist respectfully and make the social media space more palatable.",Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma are in the autumn of their careers.

A loss could complicate their progress, depending on the net run rate.Pakistan, on the other hand, must defeat Bangladesh in their final group match on Thursday and hope for a favourable outcome in India vs New Zealand to stay alive.Pakistan's hopes now hinge on tomorrow's crucial Bangladesh vs New Zealand clash.

NEW DELHI: Former Indian cricketer Shikhar Dhawan on Sunday shared his favourite international innings, highlighting his comeback century in the 2013 ICC Champions Trophy against South Africa and his gritty ton against Australia in the 2019 ICC Cricket World Cup Speaking to the media in Dubai as the ICC Champions Trophy ambassador, Dhawan reflected on these memorable knocks.""Personally, the best knock for me? There are a few,"" Dhawan said. ""My Cardiff knock against South Africa (114 off 94 balls) in the 2013 Champions Trophy was very special. It was my comeback in ODI cricket, and I handled the pressure as a youngster.""He also recalled his valiant innings in the 2019 World Cup against Australia, where he scored 117 runs despite playing with a fractured thumb. ""I got hit on 25, but I continued and got a century. That was a very dear knock to me,"" he added.Dhawan was India's go-to man in ICC ODI tournaments, finishing as the third-highest run-getter in Champions Trophy history with 701 runs in 10 innings at 77.88, including three centuries and three fifties. He remains the only batter to have won the ‘Golden Bat’ for most runs in two editions of the tournament.In 10 ODI World Cup matches, Dhawan amassed 537 runs at an average of 53.70, registering three centuries and a fifty, with a best of 137. His six ICC tournament centuries place him among India's top performers, alongside Sachin Tendulkar Rohit Sharma , and Virat Kohli Speaking on India's current opening pair, Dhawan lauded Rohit Sharma and Shubman Gill , praising Gill’s technique and Rohit’s experience.""Gill’s skill is outstanding. He has so much time. In the last game, he pulled and hit a 90-meter six— that requires incredible skill. Rohit is a legend of the game,"" Dhawan said.He emphasised the importance of chemistry between openers, saying, ""Partnerships are crucial. You must understand each other's frequency without even saying words, just through your eyes.""The Rohit-Gill duo has been highly successful, scoring 1,974 runs in 30 ODI innings at an average of 68.06, including six century and 12 fifty-run stands, with a best partnership of 212 runs.","Dhawan was India's go-to man in ICC ODI tournaments, finishing as the third- highest run-getter in Champions Trophy history.

The Argentine then assisted Aviles for the opening goal.The situation deteriorated for Inter Miami when Fafa Picault sustained an apparent muscle injury in the 10th minute, followed by Aviles receiving a straight red card for a foul on Alonso Martinez.NYCFC capitalised on their numerical advantage when Maxi Moralez's free-kick found Mitja Ilenic, who scored the equaliser.With an inexperienced defence featuring Noah Allen and Ian Fray, Miami struggled to maintain control. A costly error by Alba led to Martinez scoring NYCFC's second goal.Despite limited service to Messi and an underwhelming performance from Luis Suarez, who was later substituted, Miami persisted.

Shambolic defending

Liverpool, Feb 22, 2025 -Bruno Fernandes inspired a Manchester United rally from two goals down to avoid another damaging defeat for Ruben Amorim in a 2-2 draw at Everton on Saturday.United were headed for a ninth defeat in their last 13 league games as goals from Beto and Abdoulaye Doucoure put the Toffees 2-0 up inside 33 minutes.The visitors had not mustered a shot on target until Fernandes' free-kick pulled a goal back 18 minutes from time before Manuel Ugarte's equaliser salvaged a point for United.More late drama was to come as Everton were awarded a penalty deep into stoppage time, only for referee Andy Madley to overturn his decision after a VAR review.A point edges Everton up to 12th, while United remain in 15th.Everton were in a battle for survival when David Moyes returned for his second spell in charge last month, but they have taken 14 points from a possible 18 in their last six games to ensure their 71-year stay in the top flight will not come to an end.Amorim conceded before the game that Moyes, who himself was sacked after less than a season in charge of United in 2014, was doing a better job than he has managed since arriving from Sporting Lisbon in November.When the sides last met in Amorim's first home league game, United cruised to a 4-0 win at Old Trafford, but he has managed just three victories in 13 Premier League games since.Everton have just five more matches to come at Goodison Park before they move to a new 53,000-capacity stadium next season.The home fans and team are determined to make the most of what is left at the club's home since 1892 and put a United side lacking in confidence under pressure from the off.But when Everton did take the lead on 19 minutes it was thanks to comedic United defending.The Red Devils had multiple chances to deal with a corner into the box before the ball eventually broke for Beto to fire into the ground and over Andre Onana.The striker has been transformed since Moyes' return, scoring five times in his last four Premier League appearances after netting just four times in his first 44 for the club.Beto also had a big part to play in the second as his run in behind opened up the United defence before he fed Jack Harrison with a low cross.Onana could only parry Harrison's shot into the air and Doucoure outmuscled Harry Maguire to head in the loose ball.Doucoure was denied a second by a fine save from Onana as Everton looked to build on their lead early in the second half.But, not for the first time, Fernandes was United's one source of inspiration.The Portugal international's free-kick wrong-footed Jordan Pickford to kickstart the fightback.Another Fernandes free-kick was the source of the equaliser as this time Ugarte pounced on Beto's headed clearance to fire in his first goal for the club.Both sides had chances to win it in a thrilling finale.Beto planted a header from close range too close to Onana, while Pickford tipped over Fernandes' dipping effort from the edge of the box.United, though, were fortunate to escape in added time when Ashley Young looked to have been pulled down by a combination of Maguire and Matthijs de Ligt.The referee pointed to the spot but was instructed to take a second look and overturned his decision to save Amorim from further embarrassment.",Manchester United held to 2-2 draw by Everton at Old Trafford. Goals from Beto and Abdoulaye Doucoure put Toffees 2-0 up. Bruno Fernandes free-kick pulled United level 18 minutes from time.

PANAJI: On a flight from Goa to Mumbai last week, FC Goa coach Manolo Marquez had some advice for goalkeeper Lara Sharma .FC Goa were flying to Mumbai for their Indian Super League (ISL) clash and the goalkeeper and coach were seated next to each other. Manolo told Lara: ""You will arrive where your mind wants you to. You can be very good technically, tactically, physically, but if you are not strong enough here (in the mind), you won't make progress.""Lara needed to hear those words.On the sidelines for nine months with an ACL injury he picked up last season, Lara returned to the first team in December but soon realised he still had plenty of ground to cover with his fitness. Manolo also admitted he could have erred in rushing back the goalkeeper too soon, and it's only now that the 25-year-old has been part of the match-day squad for the last three games.Lara is yet to make an appearance for FC Goa, who he joined this season, but knows he must be ready whenever called into action.""I don't know when my chance will come, but whenever I get a chance (to play), I know I have to come up with good performance,"" Lara told TOI during the pre-match media interaction on Friday. ""It does not matter whether I get a chance tomorrow, after a month, two months or even next season. But whenever I play, I have to do well. I have to be patient.""It hasn't been an easy ride for Lara in the Indian Super League (ISL).Having graduated from the famed Tata Football Academy (TFA), Lara had stints with Indian Arrows, India juniors and ATK reserves, before moving to Bengaluru FC where he was second choice to India goalkeeper Gurpreet Singh. Nobody raised an eyebrow when he was loaned to Kerala Blasters due to lack of game time, but just when things were beginning to look up, he picked up an injury in the playoff against Odisha FC.The injury turned out to be serious. It was Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) which needed surgery and a lengthy spell out of action.""It was difficult for me because I never had injuries in my life from the day I start playing football. This was a big injury, it was really, really difficult, especially the first three-four months when I was at home. For pre-season (with Goa), there were senior players like Sandesh (Jhingan), Odei (Onaindia), Iker (Guarrotxena) who motivated me. It helped me during the rehab. It was a difficult period but taught me a lot,"" said Lara.Lara was meant to be first choice goalkeeper for Goa, until the injury disrupted plans.Laxmikant Kattimani was then signed from Hyderabad and the experienced keeper grabbed the top spot. Hrithik Tiwari was forced into action only when Kattimani was injured and since then the youngster has given a good account of himself.Lara knows his time will come.""The team is performing good, Hrithik is also playing well. It's been tough for me (on the sidelines). When I returned in December, I thought the injury was gone, I'm good, but on the pitch it was different. When I spoke with the coach, he told me I need more time (to make a comeback), so I started seeing videos of my training sessions every day. I noticed I had to improve on some things.""Then there were doubts too whether the injury will reoccur. Speaking with someone like Sandesh helps a lot. He's always positive (with his words). He's always motivating and told me injuries are part of a footballer's life. Recovery takes time, it's a process and I'll return to the field (for a competitive game),"" said Lara.",Lara Sharma is yet to make an appearance for FC Goa this season. The 25-year-old has been part of the match-day squad for the last three games. Lara returned to the first team in December but soon realised he still had plenty of ground to cover with his fitness.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118466119,imgsize-50578,width-400,resizemode-4/118466119.jpg"

The Pole, a five-time major winner, sizzled on her returns in the third game, where she broke the teen for the only time in the match. Andreeva, who had 10 aces, saved seven of eight breakpoint chances, to score a 6-3, 6-3 upset win in 97 minutes.Thursday's result was the Russian's fifth top-10 win of her career, and the second against a top-two player, following her defeat of Aryna Sabalenka in last year's Roland Garros quarterfinals.Andreeva, articulate as her shots are telling, noted that the difference between her and the elite pros was experience; the teenager turned to her coach Conchita Martinez, the 1994 Wimbledon champion, to level the playing field.""I know that no matter what's happening on the court, they (top player s) are always going to play their best tennis, and they're going to keep up their level throughout the whole match. That's the main difficulty for players that are lower ranked,"" Andreeva said.""I tell myself to fight for every ball, doesn't matter what's happening on the court,"" she said. ""I knew if I don't play aggressive she's going to go and kill me. Everybody knows that she likes to take the ball early, she doesn't give time to her opponents. She always tries to be the first one to attack. My game plan was to play my game, sometimes I just forced myself to be more aggressive.""Martinez chalks the strategy Andreeva brings to the court. ""If she didn't give me great advice and tactics I don't think I would be playing at such a high level,"" Andreeva said of the 52-year-old Spaniard, who is a calming presence at courtside. ""We take about 15 to 20 minutes to talk about the match, set up the game plan. For example, today I played at 2 (pm), we spoke at 1. It's all still fresh in my head (when I go on court).""Swiatek, who usually has a strong couple of weeks in the WTA events in the Middle East, wasn't at her best this time, falling in the semifinals to Jelena Ostapenko in Doha, and in the last-eight here in Dubai, where she looked out of sorts. The world No.2 had 31 unforced errors in the match on Thursday.""I'm not happy with the results. I feel like I under-performed,"" she said of the two weeks in Doha and Dubai. ""I need to talk with my team and plan the next weeks a bit differently because I haven't had much time to practice before these tournaments. I felt that there were some things missing (with my tennis) that should have been there.""""I wasn't really sure where my ball is going to go,"" a visibly upset Swiatek said of the match. ""I wasn't as precise as I should be. Mirra is a good player. It's not like I can win against her when I play worse.""

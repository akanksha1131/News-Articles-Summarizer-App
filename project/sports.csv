His hesitation at the crease drew immediate reactions in the commentary box.Former India cricketer Vivek Razdan quipped, “Ungliya nahi dikh rahi aapko? (Can’t you see the fingers?)”, referring to Samson’s fingers clearly under the ball at the point of completion.The exchange added spice to an already charged evening.Fakhar’s wicket was a big breakthrough for India, removing one of Pakistan’s most aggressive openers just as he threatened to cut loose.Hardik celebrated with his trademark fist pump, while Samson, who had been under scrutiny for his keeping, looked visibly relieved.",Fakhar Zaman dismissed by Hardik Pandya in the third over of Pakistan’s innings.

What did Suryakumar Yadav, Kuldeep Yadav and others say on playing Pakistan? | Asia Cup 2025

The high-octane India-Pakistan Asia Cup Super Four clash in Dubai had a viral moment when Pakistan opener Sahibzada Farhan pulled off a bold celebration after reaching his half-century.Facing Axar Patel in the 10th over, Farhan rocked back to a short delivery and dispatched it deep over midwicket for six.The shot not only brought up his fifty in style but also sparked an unusual display.The 28-year-old mimicked firing an AK-47 with his bat, drawing instant reactions from fans and commentators alike.The celebration stunned many in the stadium and set social media abuzz within minutes.Farhan’s aggressive batting was central to Pakistan’s strong start.He raced to his fifty off just 34 balls with five fours and three sixes, keeping the scoreboard moving at a brisk strike rate.His partnership with Saim Ayub helped Pakistan recover from the early dismissal of Fakhar Zaman, who fell cheaply to Hardik Pandya in the third over.At the halfway stage, Pakistan were well placed at 93/2, with Farhan anchoring from one end while Hussain Talat began to settle in.For India, the bowlers found themselves under pressure despite Bumrah’s probing new-ball spell and Kuldeep Yadav’s typically frugal middle-overs bowling.Yet, the cricket briefly took a backseat as attention shifted to Farhan’s AK-47 act.Some fans hailed it as passion and flair, while others criticised the optics of such a gesture in an India-Pakistan clash, given its politically sensitive backdrop.The celebration has already divided opinion online, with clips circulating widely.With plenty of overs left, his knock had already set the tone for a charged evening in Dubai.",Pakistan's Sahibzada Farhan mimicked firing an AK-47 with his bat.

‘They complement each other perfectly,’ Suryakumar Kumar on Abhishek Sharma-Shubman Gill stand vs Pakistan

India T20I captain Suryakumar Yadav defended pace bowler Jasprit Bumrah 's disappointing performance during India's six-wicket victory over Pakistan in the Asia Cup Super Fours clash in Dubai on Sunday. Despite Bumrah's struggles, India maintained their winning streak in the tournament, successfully chasing Pakistan's highest T20I first-innings total of 171/5 against India.Bumrah, who returned to the final XI after being rested for the Oman match, was expected to make an impact but struggled throughout his spell. The strategy was to have him bowl three overs in the powerplay and save one for the death overs.His performance began poorly when Fakhar Zaman hit consecutive boundaries in his opening over. Bumrah continued to struggle, missing yorkers and bowling no-balls, ultimately finishing with figures of 0/45. His only wicket-taking opportunity was dropped by vice-captain Shubman Gill ""That's fine, he's not a robot, he will have a bad day someday. Dube bailed us out of the situation,"" said Suryakumar Yadav during the post-match presentation.With Bumrah underperforming, Shivam Dube stepped up to provide crucial breakthroughs. Using slower deliveries and scrambled seam bowling, Dube dismissed set batsmen Sahibzada Farhan (58) and Saim Ayub (21), finishing with figures of 2/33.Pakistan's innings featured a late surge from Faheem Ashraf , helping them post their highest T20I total against India while batting first.India's successful chase was anchored by strong performances from Abhishek Sharma , who scored 74 runs, and Shubman Gill, who contributed 47 runs.

‘They complement each other perfectly,’ Suryakumar Kumar on Abhishek Sharma-Shubman Gill stand vs Pakistan

India secured a six-wicket victory over Pakistan in their Super Four Asia Cup clash in Dubai, despite some fielding errors, with Indian captain Suryakumar Yadav humorously revealing that the fielding coach T Dilip has emailed players with ""butter fingers"" to report to his office. A century partnership between Abhishek Sharma and Shubman Gill helped India successfully chase down Pakistan's total of 171/5.The match saw several dropped catches by Indian fielders including Kuldeep Yadav , Shubman Gill, and Abhishek Sharma, which allowed Pakistan to post a competitive score.""The fielding coach has sent an email to the boys, who had buttered fingers, to appear before him at his office. But this happens, it is a part of the game. I am okay with it because it happened in the first game itself, and we have more crucial games to go,"" Suryakumar said during the post-match press conference.Suryakumar noted that the batting conditions were favorable and emphasized the importance of smart cricket between overs 7 and 15.""The team which will play good cricket from over 7 to 15 will have an upper hand. You have to be smarter with your plans in the finish. In powerplay, the ball is hard and you can time it well, but after that, you have to bat smartly. That is what we did today,"" he explained.The Indian captain highlighted Shivam Dube's bowling performance as a crucial turning point in the match, praising his spell of 2/33 in four overs.""The drinks during the first innings was a turning point. When bowlers changed their line and lengths, showed more energy, spinners bowled well. Shivam Dube's spell was a turning point in the game. He has been working hard on his bowling. This was a perfect game for him. He always wanted to bowl two overs minimum, but he got four today, and he was very happy. He was very clear with his plans. This makes my job easier,"" Suryakumar stated.After winning the toss, India elected to field first. Pakistan's innings featured a strong 72-run partnership between Sahibzada Farhan, who scored 58 off 45 balls, and Saim Ayub, who made 21 from 17 balls.Late contributions from Mohammed Nawaz (21 off 19) and Faheem Ashraf (20 not out off 8) helped Pakistan reach 171/5 in their allocated 20 overs.India's bowling attack saw Shivam Dube claim two wickets for 33 runs, while Kuldeep Yadav and Hardik Pandya took one wicket each.In the chase, Abhishek Sharma played a match-winning knock of 74 from 39 balls, including six fours and five sixes, while Shubman Gill contributed 47 off 28 balls with eight boundaries.Despite Haris Rauf's effort of taking two wickets for 26 runs, Tilak Varma (30 not out) and Hardik Pandya (7 not out) guided India to victory with seven balls remaining.Abhishek Sharma was named Player of the Match for his explosive batting performance that helped India overcome their earlier fielding lapses.","India beat Pakistan by six wickets in their Super Four Asia Cup clash in Dubai.

Poll Do you agree with the third umpire's decision on Fakhar Zaman's catch? Yes, it was the right call. No, it should have been not out.

The Asia Cup Super Four encounter between India and Pakistan at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium on Sunday witnessed a controversial moment when Fakhar Zaman ’s dismissal resulted in divided opinions.Sent in to open alongside Sahibzada Farhan after India chose to bowl, Fakhar started briskly, racing to 15 off nine balls with three boundaries. He looked to continue his aggressive approach in Hardik Pandya’s second over but edged a ball back to wicketkeeper Sanju Samson.Samson dived slightly forward and claimed the catch low to the ground. Fakhar, unconvinced, stood his ground while the umpires referred it upstairs. Replays initially left a lot of room for doubt, with the ball appearing close to the turf.Several fans on social media even claimed that the ball had grazed the turf before it went in to Samson's grasp. Multiple angles were reviewed before the third umpire decided the catch clean. The decision was 'out', leaving Fakhar visibly frustrated as he shook his head on his way back.The call immediately drew reactions from the commentary box.Former India cricketer Vivek Razdan remarked, “Ungliya nahi dikh rahi aapko? (Can’t you see the fingers?)”, pointing out Samson’s fingers under the ball.However, legendary Pakistan pacers questioned the verdict. Wasim Akram was stern in his criticism. “The umpire should have checked more angles. If there is no conclusive evidence, then the benefit of the doubt should go to the batter,” said the 59-year-old.Waqar Younis expressed similar concerns at the time. “I’m not sure whether the ball carried to Samson. I would want to see another replay,” he said, reflecting the uncertainty many viewers felt.After the match ended, Pakistan skipper Salman Agha spoke to reporters, and shared his take on the same. He admitted the moment was debatable. “Umpires can make mistakes. To me, it looked like it bounced before it carried. Umpires can also make mistakes. I can be wrong as well,” he told reporters after the match.Fakhar’s own reaction told its story. Clearly upset, he appeared to mutter something as he left the field, though it remained unclear who it was directed at.The decision, as controversial as it was, handed India a key early breakthrough, removing one of Pakistan’s most aggressive openers. Hardik Pandya celebrated with his trademark fist pump.","Fakhar Zaman's wicket stirred controversy in the India-Pakistan clash.

Villa remain winless

Gabriel Martinelli struck deep into stoppage time to earn Arsenal a 1-1 draw against Manchester City on Sunday, keeping the Gunners within sight of the Premier League summit.City had led from the ninth minute after Erling Haaland finished off a swift counter-attack. The Norwegian forward began the move in his own half, linked up with Tijjani Reijnders, and raced clear to slot past David Raya. Haaland’s goal was his 13th of the season for club and country.Arsenal found it difficult to respond in a subdued first half, their best chance falling to Noni Madueke, whose strike was pushed away by Gianluigi Donnarumma. The Italian goalkeeper has settled quickly since joining City and produced another key save to deny Eberechi Eze in the second half.Mikel Arteta introduced Bukayo Saka and Eze after the break in search of creativity, but City sat deeper as Pep Guardiola withdrew Haaland and Phil Foden to reinforce his defence. That approach looked set to secure three points until Martinelli, on as a substitute, latched onto Eze’s lofted pass and lifted the ball over Donnarumma in the 93rd minute.The result leaves Arsenal second in the table, five points behind leaders Liverpool, while City sit ninth.Aston Villa’s poor start under Unai Emery showed no signs of easing as they were held 1-1 at 10-man Sunderland.The hosts lost Reinildo Mandava to a red card in the 33rd minute for an off-the-ball kick at Matty Cash. Villa, without a goal in their previous four league outings, finally ended that drought when Cash’s long-range strike beat goalkeeper Robin Roefs in the 41st minute.But the advantage was short-lived. Wilson Isidor levelled eight minutes later, capitalising on Granit Xhaka’s header for his third goal in as many league matches at the Stadium of Light.Emery admitted his side failed to impose themselves despite the numerical advantage. “It should have been easier to take advantage (against 10 men) but we were not playing with our identity, with the ideas we have been building in the last three years,” he said, as quoted by AFP.The draw leaves Villa in the bottom three with three points from five games, while Sunderland move into seventh.",Gabriel Martinelli scores in stoppage time to earn Arsenal a 1-1 draw against Manchester City.

Poll Is Messi the best player in MLS history? Yes No Not sure

Superstar Lionel Messi once again showcased why he is indispensable for Inter Miami, scoring two brilliant goals and creating another as his side defeated DC United 3-2 on Saturday at Chase Stadium in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. The victory keeps Miami firmly in the hunt for an MLS Cup playoff spot.Messi, 38, now has 22 goals in 22 matches this season, moving to the top of the MLS scoring chart after surpassing Sam Surridge of Nashville. This marked Messi’s seventh double of the campaign, highlighting his consistent brilliance.“It was another ordinary night for him, which is totally extraordinary for any other football player,” Miami coach Javier Mascherano said. “His ability not only to score but to make the team play, to find situations, and to carry the team on his shoulders when we needed him most — that is the advantage of having him.”Miami opened the scoring in the 35th minute when Messi threaded a precise through ball to Tadeo Allende, who slotted past DC United goalkeeper Luis Barraza. Christian Benteke equalised in the 52nd minute, but Messi soon restored Miami’s lead with a composed finish from Jordi Alba’s pass in the 66th minute.Messi added a third in the 85th, dribbling past defenders before curling a left-footed strike beyond Barraza. The goal proved crucial as Jacob Murrell scored in stoppage time to make it 3-2.Mascherano also praised Messi’s off-the-ball generosity. When 19-year-old Mateo Silvetti missed a penalty, Messi’s earlier assist had been a gesture to involve a teammate seeking his first goal, reflecting the Argentine’s leadership and team spirit.With the win, Miami climbed to fifth in the Eastern Conference with 52 points. Messi’s heroics not only kept Miami’s playoff hopes alive but also reinforced why the club is eager to extend his stay in Major League Soccer beyond next year.","Lionel Messi scored twice as Inter Miami defeated DC United 3-2.

Amorim relief

MANCHESTER: Manchester United eased the pressure on beleaguered boss Ruben Amorim with a chaotic 2-1 win against Chelsea as both teams finished with 10 men at Old Trafford.Fighting to avoid the sack after a woeful start to the season, Amorim received a welcome boost when Chelsea goalkeeper Robert Sanchez was sent off after just five minutes of Saturday's clash.Bruno Fernandes quickly put United ahead with his 100th goal for the club in all competitions in his 200th Premier League appearance.Casemiro doubled United's lead before the Brazil midfielder was dismissed for a second booking in first-half stoppage time.Trevoh Chalobah's late reply for Chelsea set up a tense finale, but United held on for just their second win in six matches in all competitions this term.Having kicked off languishing just above the relegation zone, Amorim's side climbed to ninth place to give the Portuguese coach a little breathing space.Amorim, who has won just nine of his 32 Premier League matches, shouldn't rest on his laurels just yet.After presiding over United's lowest top-flight finish since 1973-74 and a limp Europa League final loss to Tottenham last term, Amorim spent big in the summer to overhaul his moribund team.But United suffered an embarrassing League Cup exit at fourth-tier Grimsby in August before last weekend's 3-0 loss at Manchester City underlined the vast gulf to their rivals.Former Sporting Lisbon boss Amorim, who replaced the sacked Erik ten Hag in November, insists he retains the backing of co-owner Jim Ratcliffe after speaking to the British billionaire at the club's training ground on Thursday.Ratcliffe was in the directors box at rain-lashed Old Trafford to see if his support for Amorim was well placed.With storm clouds gathering for Amorim, he stuck with his much-criticised 3-4-3 formation after joking this week that even the Pope could not make him change his tactics.The move paid dividends as United made a flying start, with left wing-back Patrick Dorgu crossing for Bryan Mbeumo, whose header was saved by Sanchez.Just moments later, the erratic Sanchez rashly raced out of his penalty area in a bid to clear before Mbeumo could reach Benjamin Sesko's flick, but instead sent the United forward crashing to the turf with a reckless challenge.It was a clear red card for denying a goal-scoring opportunity and there were no complaints from Chelsea about their quickest ever Premier League dismissal.Filip Jorgensen replaced Sanchez in goal as Maresca took off wingers Estevao Willian and Pedro Neto in a defensive move that immediately backfired.United went for the jugular and Mbeumo volleyed just over after Fernandes's free-kick cannoned off the Chelsea wall.Amorim's men took the lead in the 14th minute when Fernandes, played just onside by Chalobah, timed his run perfectly to meet Dorgu's header with a clinical finish from four yards.Chelsea's misery mounted when England forward Cole Palmer was forced off with an apparent recurrence of a groin injury, making it a remarkable three substitutions in only 21 minutes for the Blues.For once, the luck was all going Amorim's way and Chelsea imploded to gift United their second goal in the 37th minute.Jorgensen stood rooted to the spot as Reece James's sliced clearance was headed on by Harry Maguire to Casemiro, who nodded home from close range for his first league goal in 11 months.Casemiro, booked for an earlier foul on Enzo Fernandez, saw red on the stroke of half-time after needlessly pulling back Andrey Santos.United struggled to find any rhythm in the second half and Chalobah reduced the deficit in the 80th minute when the unmarked Chalobah met James's cross with a powerful header that flashed past Altay Bayindir from 12 yards.It was too late to stop Chelsea slumping to their first league defeat this season as Amorim breathed a sigh of relief.",Manchester United beat Chelsea 2-1 at Old Trafford. Both teams finished with 10 men after Robert Sanchez was sent off. Bruno Fernandes scored his 100th goal for the club in all competitions.

Red-hot Mbappe

In-form striker Kylian Mbappe netted again as Real Madrid beat Espanyol 2-0 on Saturday to extend their lead at the top of La Liga.Xabi Alonso's Madrid have won all five of their opening league fixtures and French superstar Mbappe has netted five goals in the top flight.Eder Militao opened the scoring with a screamer from distance after 22 minutes and Mbappe buried the second from outside the box early in the second half.Madrid are five points clear of second-place champions Barcelona, who host Getafe on Sunday.England international Jude Bellingham made a late appearance as a substitute in the final stages, his first since undergoing shoulder surgery in the summer.""We can't be doing any better,"" Madrid defender Dani Carvajal told Real Madrid TV.""The good thing is we're getting better at playing in the way the coach wants, understanding the concepts and the results are coming with that.""Carvajal was happy with the team's display, with Madrid showing more defensive solidity than at many times last season.""I think the performance was complete and we suffered very little in a defensive sense,"" continued Carvajal.""We're leaving as leaders, we're still at the top of the table and our objective was completed.""Mbappe, who netted twice from the penalty spot in midweek as Madrid started their Champions League campaign with a win over Marseille, helped Alonso's team maintain their 100 percent record across all competitions.His goal effectively killed the game after Militao head sent Madrid ahead.Alonso brought Vinicius Junior back into the side and gave young striker Gonzalo Garcia a rare start in an attacking line-up.Espanyol have not beaten Madrid at the Santiago Bernabeu since 1996 but have started this season well, arriving in the capital third.However their visit to face Los Blancos was a reality check and Madrid were comfortably on top throughout.Despite their dominance it took a ferocious drive into the top left corner from long range by centre-back Militao to break the deadlock.Mbappe fired narrowly wide after good work by Vinicius before half-time.The Brazilian has been benched on a couple of occasions by Alonso and is still playing below his best, although he set up Mbappe for the second.After driving forward with the ball Vinicius laid it off to Mbappe, who flashed a shot past Marko Dmitrovic at the near post from range.Vinicius hit the post after Espanyol's Serbian goalkeeper made a fine double save from Mbappe.Alonso brought on Bellingham and Eduardo Camavinga for their first games of the season in the final stages of a comfortable afternoon for Real Madrid.Earlier Levante romped to a 4-0 win at Girona, who finished with nine men.The Catalan minnows, who finished third in the 2023/24 campaign to reach the Champions League, are bottom, without a win this season.""After five weeks we are the worst team in the league and all we can do is work hard,"" said coach Michel Sanchez.""I have to improve this team and I will do it.

Everton has not won a match at Anfield attended by fans since 1999, its only victory since then behind closed doors in 2021 during the pandemic.Everton manager David Moyes remained winless in 23 games at Anfield with the Toffees, Manchester United, Sunderland and West Ham.Liverpool’s top two summer signings, Alexander Isak and Florian Wirtz, entered as second-half substitutes, Wirtz in the 61st and Isak in the 67th.Gravenberch put Liverpool ahead in the 10th when Mohamed Salah lofted a one-hop pass into his path. The defensive midfielder extended his right leg and on the half volley lifted the ball over the outstretched arm of goalkeeper Jordan Pickford.Gravenberch made a perfect through-pass in the 29th and Hugo Ekitike slotted the ball through Pickford's legs and inside the far post.Gueye scored on a long-range shot after Iliman Ndiaye tapped back Jack Grealish's cross. About to turn 36 next Friday, Gueye became the second oldest Everton player to score in a Merseyside derby behind 37-year-old Sam Chedgzoy in 1926, according to Opta.Pressure mountingIn another bad day for West Ham coach Graham Potter, his team lost for the fourth time in five games, going down at home to Crystal Palace 2-1.Former Chelsea coach Potter has won just six times in 25 games since being hired in January and has lost 14 of them.The subject of insulting crowd chants at London Stadium, Potter said, “I didn’t hear it. I understand the frustration, but there’s nothing I can say.""He lasted only seven months at Chelsea and there has already been speculation in the British media about potential replacements, including former Nottingham Forest coach Nuno Espirito Santo and West Ham icon Slaven Bilic.When asked if he thought he had the backing of the club hierarchy, Potter said: ""I’ve no reason to think not. But I also understand the environment and the results.”Tyrick Mitchell scored a 68th-minute winner for Palace after Jean-Philippe Mateta's opening goal was canceled by Jarrod Bowen.West Ham was 18th in the standings with three points.Wolves still lastIt's even worse for Wolverhampton after losing at home to Leeds 3-1.Vitor Pereira's team was in last place and still looking for its first points after five games.Pereira signed a new contract at the club this week, but it looks like he's set for a tough season.Defeat came despite Ladislav Krejci firing Wolves ahead inside eight minutes. Dominic Calvert-Lewin scored his first goal for Leeds since his move from Everton in the summer.Anton Stach and Noah Okafor also got on the score sheet for the newly promoted team.Spurs fightbackTrailing 2-0 at Brighton, Tottenham came back to salvage a 2-2 draw.Goals from Yankuba Minteh and Yasin Ayari looked like putting Brighton on course for only its second win of the season. But Richarlison halved the deficit before halftime and an own goal from Jan Paul van Hecke in the 82nd secured a point for Spurs.It's the second time this season Brighton has squandered a lead late on, having conceded a stoppage time equalizer in the 1-1 draw with Fulham on the opening day.Ange Postecoglou got his first point as Nottingham Forest coach in a 1-1 draw at Burnley.","Ryan Gravenberch scores and assists in Liverpool's 2-1 win over Everton.

U-23 players take the big leap

BENGALURU: India national football coach Khalid Jamil said his focus is the AFC Asian Cup qualifier against Singapore away on October 9.With the camp beginning here from Saturday, Jamil said, “We have to play as a unit. We have to prepare very well and just give our best,” Jamil said at a press conference along with India U-23 coach Naushad Moosa, senior women’s national team Crispin Chettri and women’s U-20 & -17 head coach Joakim Alexandersson.The coach said the team will have the services of Sunil Chhetri and defender Sandesh Jhingan, who is recovering from a jaw injury. “Sunil has done well last year. So I think this is the correct time to give him a game chance. And if the U-23 players are good, we will definitely choose them.”Moosa was happy to see his wards make the big stride. “This (senior India) squad had nine U-23 players. But I’ve told him (Jamil) to look at two more players,” Moosa told TOI. “It’s a great time that so many players have been called for the senior team. They showed character in the AFC U-23 qualifiers. I’m sure they’ll make a lot of difference when they get into the senior squad. They have that potential,” Moosa said.",India national football coach Khalid Jamil said his focus is the AFC Asian Cup qualifier against Singapore away on October 9.

15 eminent players to be part of football body’s general house with voting rights

Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel.

NEW DELHI/PANAJI: Replicating the BCCI constitution framework it had approved in 2018, the Supreme Court on Friday gave final shape to the constitution of All India Football Federation (AIFF) which debars ministers and bureaucrats from football management and imposes a 70-year-age cap on office bearers.A bench of Justices P S Narasimha and Joymalya Bagchi directed AIFF to convene a special general body meeting and adopt the draft constitution, as modified by the SC, within four weeks and hoped that it would make a new beginning for Indian football. The present governing body would continue till Sep 2026.The AIFF now has enough time on hand to convene a general body meeting – likely on Oct 14 in Goa – and adopt the constitution, which will beat FIFA’s threat of suspension “if there’s no definitive order from the Supreme Court and ratification of the constitution by the general body before Oct 30.”AIFF had pleaded for non-exclusion of public servants as well as MPs and MLAs — who could be sports people — from management of football. The bench in its 78-page judgment said any person who is a minister or a government servant would not be eligible to be an office bearer of AIFF.Writing the judgement, Justice Narasimha said the 15 eminent football players in the AIFF general body would have voting rights and rejected state association’s opposition to their voting right premised on the argument that these former players would enjoy over 25% of voting rights.“The argument of state associations regarding transgression of FIFA Statute lacks merit in as much as the Standard Statutes 2005 itself suggests the inclusion of experienced players with voting rights,” the bench said, adding that the model Sports Code does not prohibit eminent players from having more than 25% voting right.On public servants, the bench clarified that if they obtain requisite permission, they would be eligible to be in the AIFF governing body. It rejected petitioners’ plea for exclusion of office bearers of National Sports Federation from holding posts in AIFF. SC said an AIFF officer bearer would be disqualified if convicted and sentenced for more than two years, akin to the norms applicable to MPs and MLAs.As per the draft composition of AIFF, the general body would comprise one representative from every member association, 15 eminent players including five women elected from a national players body, three club representatives from ISL, I-League and Indian Women’s League, a male and a female representative from referees and two – male and female - from among coaches.Who could be in the category of eminent players? This posed a challenge to the SC as India does not have a sufficient pool of eminent players who have represented India in 15 competitive matches recognized by FIFA or Asian Football Confederation (AFC).The bench reduced the benchmark for eminent players – men must have represented India in five matches and women in two.The bench said any amendment “shall not be given effect” to without its approval, highlighting concerns that the approved constitution might be given a go-by, by the federation officials “if safety valves are not put in place.”",Supreme Court gives final shape to the constitution of All India Football Federation.

Poll What is your opinion on the handling of the situation by Liverpool FC? They are doing the right thing. They could have acted faster.

The Football Association has launched an investigation into alleged discriminatory language used by Liverpool Women’s goalkeeper Rafaela Borggrafe.According to reports from Britain’s PA news agency, the comments were overheard by teammates and staff during a recent squad photo-shoot. The matter was then raised internally before being referred to the FA.Liverpool confirmed the development in a statement on Friday. “The club has followed its protocols to the fullest extent and the alleged incident has been reported to the FA, which is conducting an investigation with our full support,” the statement read.“We condemn all forms of discrimination; it has no place in football or society. We are unable to comment further while the investigation is ongoing,” the club added.Borggrafe, 25, joined Liverpool in July from Freiburg on a free transfer but has yet to make her debut in the Women’s Super League. She was not included in the squad for the opening-day 4-1 defeat to Everton but returned to training afterwards and was listed as an unused substitute in last weekend’s 1-0 loss to Leicester City.Liverpool are scheduled to face Aston Villa in their next league fixture on Sunday.The FA has not provided a timeline for the outcome of its inquiry.Meanwhile, the senior men's side pulled off a thrilling late win over Atletico Madrid in the UEFA Champions League thanks to a late goal from Virgil van Dijk.

Poll Should Diego Simeone have reacted to the insults from Liverpool supporters? Yes, he was provoked. No, he should have remained calm.

Atlético Madrid coach Diego Simeone admitted he regretted his confrontation with Liverpool supporters during Wednesday’s Champions League clash at Anfield, though he insisted that his reaction was provoked by repeated insults from the stands.The heated exchange came moments after Virgil van Dijk struck a late winner to seal Liverpool’s 3-2 victory, shortly after Atlético had fought back from two goals down thanks to a Marcos Llorente brace. As celebrations erupted, Simeone turned towards the crowd behind his bench and clashed with fans, prompting stewards to intervene. Referee Maurizio Mariani then sent him off.Explaining the incident afterwards, Simeone said, “When they scored the third goal he turned around and insulted me. I’m a person, I’m human.”“They were shouting insults through the whole game from behind the bench and I cannot say anything as I am a coach. Obviously my reaction is not justifiable, I insulted him. But it was 90 minutes of being insulted the whole time then you turn around, when your opponent has scored, and they are still insulting you. It is not that easy,” he said after the game.Simeone declined to elaborate on the nature of the abuse, saying, “I am not really going to get into the exact nature of the insults.I don’t want to get into that discussion. I know what went on behind the manager’s bench. I cannot solve society’s problems in one press conference. I have to live with it because it happens all the time.”UEFA is awaiting the referee’s report before considering disciplinary action, but Simeone suggested Liverpool should also address the matter. “I hope that a team like Liverpool can improve that part. When they identify the person who did this, it should have its consequences. But the person who needs to stay calm, and take the insults, is me. In my place you just have to take it,” he said.","Diego Simeone was sent off in Atletico Madrid's 3-2 win over Liverpool.

What’s common between the three Formula E world champions

How the three World Champions fared in Formula E Season 11

Days after Oliver Rowland lifted his Formula E World Championship trophy in London this season, an interesting trend has come to the attention of Formula E and its fans. As a coincidence, all Formula E drivers who won the Mexico City E-Prix went on to win the Formula E World Championship that season, and this has been proved right for three consecutive years.Highlighting the same since 2023, a poster of three World Champions was shared on X by Formula E with the caption, “The trend continues. Each winner of the #MexicoCityEPrix from the past three seasons has gone on to become World Champion.”The special poster features 2023 Formula E World Champion Jake Dennis from Andretti, then TAG Heuer Porsche’s Pascal Wehrlein, who won in 2024, and the new World Champion, Nissan driver Oliver Rowland. All three of them won in the Mexico E-Prix and went on to lift the winner’s trophy in the Formula E World Championship that year.Oliver Rowland had strengthened his chances of winning the Formula E World Championship this year much earlier. He was leading the Formula E Driver Standings ever since he won Part 2 of the Jeddah E-Prix, which was his second win of the season after winning the Mexico E-Prix. In the last leg, the Nissan driver got nervous for a while as Pascal Wehrlein, who was following him in the number two position, closed the gap after grabbing quite a few podiums while Rowland had a dull period.Things became serious for Rowland when he failed to finish the Round 13 race in Berlin, while Wehrlein won second spot on the podium. But he eventually managed to confirm his championship in Berlin after four wins and three more podiums.Sharing about his bad race in Berlin, Rowland had said, “I was hoping before the weekend that the outcome could be [the World Championship], but after yesterday (Saturday) and this morning (Sunday), I was more worried that it might never come.”Also Read: Oliver Rowland reacts to daughter’s sweet radio message after Formula E Championship win: “It’s amazing” Things, however, changed for Wehrlein, who was pushed to third position after Nick Cassidy made a late entry in the Formula E Driver Standings by registering three consecutive wins.

Taylor Barnard on losing top three spot in Formula E World Championship

Fans hail Taylor Barnard for his fantastic rookie season

It was Taylor Barnard’s rookie season this year, and the NEOM McLaren driver put up a fantastic performance by temporarily making it to the top three in the Formula E Driver Standings by ousting the much more experienced Porsche driver Antonio Felix Da Costa. He was, however, ousted from the top three at the London E-Prix as Jaguar’s Nick Cassidy went on to register three consecutive wins. Barnard took to Instagram to share his feelings on losing out on the top three in his first-ever season and his claim to the championship.Taking to Instagram after the London E-Prix, Barnard wrote, “London wasn’t what we hoped for, easily being the toughest weekend of our season. Taking 0 points away as a team from a doubleheader hurts, but one weekend doesn’t define the year we’ve had.”He further wrote, “As the season closes, I want to say a massive thank you to the entire team, both trackside and behind the scenes, for everything this season.

We couldn’t have done it without you all — your trust and support have never been taken for granted,” he added.Praising the two McLaren drivers, he wrote, “Sam clinched McLaren’s first-ever fully electric win at the São Paulo E-Prix in Season 10, pulling off one of Formula E’s all-time great overtakes, before being waved across the line by none other than Emerson Fittipaldi – McLaren's first Formula 1 World Champion. While Taylor has been a rookie sensation in Season 11, securing five Formula E records, including the youngest driver to start a race, the youngest points scorer, the youngest driver to lead a lap, the youngest podium finisher, and the youngest polesitter. ”He ended the letter saying, “Some of us have been together since the day we first launched this team, while others have seamlessly fitted in along the way and flourished within the environment we have cultivated. For many, I am sure that we will cross paths again soon, but whatever the future holds for those here at Bicester, whatever path they choose to follow, I have no doubt that it will be bright.

How do Formula E and ABB work together?

What do ABB and Formula E say about the partnership?

After a successful Season 11, ABB and Formula E have announced that they will continue their partnership in the upcoming season. This gives ABB another opportunity to promote its new brand positioning via the ABB FIA Formula E World Championship, along with technologies that help industries take a cleaner route.Over a period of eight seasons, the partnership with Formula E has provided ABB a platform to showcase how technology can help industries outrun challenges, engage with customers around the world, and implement its own solutions into the series to improve reliability and efficiency. The partnership extension will provide a year-round opportunity for brand-building and activation, communicating ABB and its technology solutions to new global audiences, including Formula E’s international fanbase.ABB and Formula E will also join hands to engage a new generation of fans, collaborating with unexpected influencers and content creators to tell compelling stories that make advanced electrification and automation technologies tangible and exciting.The end of the mid-race car swap, a 150kW increase in power, top speeds that are 43 percent higher, and energy recovery increasing from 15 to 50 percent indicate how far Formula E technology has come to outperform on track.ABB has also built on its technical involvement in the series, supplying the race chargers from Season 9, and introducing its ABB Ability OPTIMAX® energy management software (Season 9) and Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) technology (Season 5) to the sport.ABB Head of Brand Paco Liebrand said, “We are pleased to be continuing our partnership with Formula E which, like ABB, is striving for a leaner and cleaner future. The synergy between the two organizations, combined with the global appeal of the Championship, makes it a great platform to promote our brand positioning.”He further said, “Formula E is increasingly working with content creators, influencers, and celebrities, with initiatives such as the Evo Sessions making an impact through digital channels beyond the racing itself, which is also an essential part of ABB’s new brand strategy. Going forward, we will be enhancing the way we harness the benefits of this collaboration, ensuring the focus is on delivering content and activations that reinforce our new messaging, build familiarity, and tell the ‘Engineered to Outrun’ story. ”Formula E Chief Revenue Officer Tiziana Di Gioia said, “Our renewed partnership with ABB is a testament to the commercial power and benefit of Formula E as a global platform that drives both brand and business growth. ABB, like our wider partnership portfolio, has and continues to see enormous value in collaborating with the fastest-growing motorsport on the planet, with viewership, commercial integration, and brand storytelling continuing to accelerate. Over eight seasons, ABB has moved from brand visibility to brand activation—integrating deeply into the fan experience, the sport’s ecosystem, and our innovation narrative.Also Read: Antonio Felix Da Costa shares happy memories as Porsche wins Formula E Teams and Manufacturers’ World Championships “This next chapter elevates the partnership even further. With ABB’s new positioning, we are co-creating opportunities across content, digital storytelling, and market engagement, transforming a title partnership into a year-round, value-generating relationship. It’s a model of how modern sponsorships should evolve, rooted in purpose and cultural alignment but measured by impact,” she added.Formula E Season 12 will begin with testing in Valencia in October.","ABB and Formula E have announced that they will continue their partnership in the upcoming season.

Team World def. Team Europe 15-9

Taylor Fritz held off Alexander Zverev 6-3, 7-6 (7/4) to seal Team World's triumph in the Laver Cup on Sunday as two wins for Carlos Alcaraz on the final day proved too little for Team Europe.Fritz fired a backhand volley winner on his first match point to give Team World a 15-9 victory over Europe in the global tennis event, sparking jubilant celebrations from his teammates and World captain Andre Agassi at Chase Center -- home of the NBA's Golden State Warriors.""The energy from the team, it just feels the moments of winning feel so much better, the moments of losing feel so much worse because you're doing it for all these guys,"" Fritz said.""It just fires me up so much,"" added the fifth-ranked American, who had beaten Alcaraz on Saturday when Team World swept all four matches to seize a 9-3 lead.Fritz had raced through the opening set against a weary-looking Zverev.The German stepped it up in the second set, but he was down a break and trailing 4-3 before he finally mustered his first break points of the night.He converted his third to level the set at 4-4 to the delight of his Europe teammates and captain Yannick Noah.A quick hold from Zverev left Fritz serving to stay in the set.He held to love and they battled to the tiebreaker, where Fritz took a 3-0 lead only for Zverev to win three straight points before Fritz won four of the final five.Alcaraz, fresh off his sixth Grand Slam title at the US Open, had kept Europe's title defense alive with a blistering 6-2, 6-1 victory over Argentina's Francisco Cerundolo.Alcaraz and Casper Ruud had sliced Europe's deficit with a 7-6 (7/4), 6-1 doubles victory over Reilly Opelka and Alex Michelsen to open Sunday's action.But Australian world number eight Alex De Minaur then beat Czech Jakub Mensik 6-3, 6-4 to push Team World's lead to 12-6, with 13 points needed to claim the Cup and each match on Sunday worth three points.De Minaur, a late replacement on Team World for Frances Tiafoe, had nabbed two wins on Saturday -- beating Zverev in singles and coming through again in doubles.Team World regained the title they surrendered to Europe last year in Berlin.Europe have won five of eight editions of the event co-created by Swiss great Roger Federer , which will be held in London next year.Ruud def.

SHENZHEN: Jasmine Paolini beat Jessica Pegula on the fourth match point as defending champion Italy won the Billie Jean King Cup with a comprehensive victory over the United States on Sunday.Italy won both singles ties in straight sets, meaning there was no need for a decisive doubles match. The No. 8-ranked Paolini beat seventh-ranked Pegula 6-4, 6-2 after No. 91 Elisabetta Cocciaretto won 6-4, 6-4 against Emma Navarro, breaking her serve three times.Paolini broke Pegula's serve with a two-hand backhand down the line to take the first set and move Italy closer to success at the Shenzhen Bay Sports Center Arena in China.But with Paolini serving for the match at 5-1 she wavered a little. Pegula saved three match points and then two unforced errors from Paolini allowed Pegula to break back to 5-2 down.A strong looping forehand gave Paolini - the runner-up at the French Open and Wimbledon last year - a fourth match point and she took it, clinching victory when Pegula's two-handed backhand clipped the net and landed wide.Paolini raised her arms in the air, then walked over to hug her teammates.All the staff members joined them on the court as they danced in a circle before celebrating with blue-shirted, flag-waving Italy fans.Pegula and Navarro each came from a set down to defeat Britain and reach the final.But not this time.Italy boasted a doubles pairing of Olympic champions Paolini and Sara Errani, who also won the French Open doubles together this year. They would have faced Pegula and top-ranked doubles player Taylor Townsend in what might have been an exciting trophy decider.The BJK Cup was formerly known as the Fed Cup, and the United States is the most successful team as an 18-time winner, but not since 2017.Italy was contesting its third straight final and clinched its sixth title.

Poll Do you think it’s important for public figures like Bjorn Borg to share personal struggles with addiction? Absolutely, it can inspire others Yes, but only if they feel comfortable Not really, it's their personal life

Swedish tennis icon Bjorn Borg has made a deeply personal revelation in his newly released autobiography Heartbeats: A Memoir, published on Thursday, disclosing his long-hidden battles with cocaine addiction and a recent prostate cancer diagnosis.The 69-year-old former world No.1, who dominated tennis in the 1970s and early 1980s, confessed that his first experience with cocaine in the early 1980s at New York’s legendary nightclub Studio 54 gave him “a rush as strong as what tennis had given me in the past.”His darkest years, Borg recounts, came in the 1990s when he was living in Milan with then-wife, Italian singer Loredana Bertè. “We had bad influences, and… drugs and pills within reach. There, I was plunged into the deepest darkness,” Borg writes.The low point arrived in 1996, when Borg collapsed on a bridge in the Netherlands just before an exhibition tournament. “When I awoke in hospital, my father was standing next to me. He said nothing, it was so embarrassing. I was terribly ashamed,” he told Swedish talk show Skavlan.In the memoir, Borg also reveals that he was diagnosed with prostate cancer in September 2023.“The risk of it coming back still exists, and it’s something I will have to live with… with the anxiety of not knowing if the cancer was caught in time,” he wrote, adding that he undergoes check-ups every six months.Despite his health challenges, Borg stressed that he exercises daily, though he admitted he has not “played tennis in six years.”The 11-time Grand Slam champion also touched on doping in modern tennis, expressing concern about junior players and questioning Jannik Sinner’s decision to rehire fitness coach Umberto Ferrara after the Italian’s brief suspension for a steroid violation.Borg, who retired shockingly at just 26 after conquering Wimbledon five times and the French Open six times, said his memoir is about confronting demons, shame, and survival.",Tennis great Bjorn Borg has released his autobiography Heartbeats: A Memoir.

"Tennis legend Boris Becker's prison experience: Poker debt, confrontations, life lessons, and more",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/top-stories/tennis-legend-boris-beckers-prison-experience-poker-debt-confrontations-life-lessons-and-more/articleshow/123899864.cms,"Boris Becker (Photo by Gerald Matzka/Getty Images)

In one of the latest Daily Mail stories, Boris Becker recalls utilising his ability to read opponents during his tennis career, noting how he could identify weaknesses in players like Ivan Lendl and Stefan Edberg.This skill proved valuable during his time at Huntercombe prison near Henley-on-Thames in Oxfordshire, where he served time for Insolvency Act violations.In September 2022, after serving five months of his two-and-a-half-year sentence, Becker joined a poker game with Romanian inmates that would lead to a dangerous situation.As a foreign national, Becker was offered early release through deportation after serving half his sentence, allowing him to potentially spend Christmas with his partner Lilian.The poker games, played with matchsticks representing money, resulted in Becker accumulating a supposed debt of £500 to the Romanian inmates.For Becker, who had been a millionaire since age 17 and regularly earned millions annually, £500 would have been insignificant outside prison. However, inside it represented about eight months of weekly allowance.Two Romanian inmates visited Becker's cell demanding payment, followed by a warning from Bogdan, another Romanian inmate known for killing two men.""Boris, this guy's a little crazy. And you got to find a way to pay soon, because otherwise you're going to see how crazy he can be,"" Bogdan warned Becker.Becker arranged for a bank transfer to settle the debt without informing Lilian of the situation.A new inmate named Zac arrived at the prison, wearing a rubber cap and rumored to have mental health issues.One day, Becker confronted Zac for being in his friend Ike's cell without permission, leading to a threatening confrontation.""I'm going to f- you up. I'm going to break your head. I'm going to slit your throat. I'm going to kill you,"" Zac shouted at Becker.Fellow inmates, including Shuggy and others, intervened to protect Becker during the confrontation.Ike, a drug dealer who had become Becker's friend, later explained that Zac had spent 17 years in Belmarsh prison for murder and was mentally unstable.Three days after the incident, Zac apologized to Becker in the laundry room, kneeling and kissing his hand.""I disrespected you,"" Zac said, acknowledging both Becker and Ike's influence in the prison.Becker later played chess with Zac, deliberately losing to avoid further confrontation.Andy Small, the prison warden who taught Stoicism, had warned Becker about the exhausting nature of navigating prison relationships.Becker received numerous letters of support, including a message from Liverpool manager Jürgen Klopp, though Klopp's attempts to visit were denied by prison authorities.Lilian was eventually permitted three monthly visits, with wardens allowing limited physical contact during these meetings.Shuggy became Becker's barber, cutting both his hair and beard, requiring significant trust given the use of sharp implements.On Becker's 55th birthday, he received unexpected kindness from fellow inmates, including three separate birthday cakes from Ike, Shuggy, and Alex, an Albanian inmate.The inmates also presented Becker with a handmade birthday card, marking a stark contrast to his previous milestone birthdays.Becker's release was arranged for December 14, with plans to depart via private jet to Germany.He distributed his belongings to fellow inmates the day before his release, sharing knowing glances with Ike and Shuggy.At 6 AM on release day, Becker was escorted to Biggin Hill airport, where he reunited with Lilian.They successfully avoided media attention by landing in Stuttgart instead of Munich or Frankfurt.After his release, Becker struggled to adjust to normal life, continuing to sleep on the edge of beds as if still in his prison cot.Becker and Lilian eventually settled in Milan, Italy, starting fresh with minimal possessions.The experience helped Becker recognize the need for significant life changes, leading to his marriage to Lilian on the Italian Riviera.The article concludes with an account of Pat Cash visiting Huntercombe Prison to discuss Stoicism, leading to a reconciliation between the former tennis rivals.","Boris Becker served five months of his two-and-a-half-year sentence.

Poll Will India secure a victory in the upcoming Test against West Indies? Definitely Probably Unlikely No chance

Junk the theory right away that it is easy being an Indian cricket team, especially when it plays Test cricket at home. It’s a fallacy.Why? Because you are expected to win. Even a draw is looked at as a defeat, and a series defeat, like when India last played Tests at home against New Zealand, is viewed as a catastrophe, especially if it leads to the team missing out on the WTC final.As Shubman Gill prepares to lead India for the first time at home against a depleted West Indies side in the first Test here on a grassy red-soil pitch at the Narendra Modi Stadium on Thursday, he knows that crucial WTC points are at stake.India are currently in third place behind Australia and Sri Lanka, and with South Africa, the reigning WTC champions, arriving in Nov for two Tests in Guwahati and Kolkata, this is India’s chance to move ahead.For that, they will have to avoid the mistakes committed against New Zealand when they misread conditions in Bangalore and got bowled out for 46, and then out of panic, chose to play on square turners in Pune and Mumbai.The move backfired. And how. New captain. New regime. New WTC cycle. And the hosts seem to be in correction mode. They have prepared a red-soil pitch with a generous covering of grass, which allows them to attack their opponents with both pace and spin.West Indies seem handcuffed as their two gun pacers, Shamar Joseph and Alzarri Joseph, both missed the India sojourn due to injuries. Their spin attack is inexperienced and the heavy lifting will have to be done by skipper Roston Chase and Jomel Warrican. That has probably emboldened India to lay out the surface that they have.With the pitch mostly under covers because of sporadic rains in the city, India will be tempted to play both Mohammed Siraj and Jasprit Bumrah. Red-soil pitches eventually start turning big as the match wears on, and India are well-stocked in the spin department. If they stick to their template of packing the side with all-rounders and take the brave option of batting wicket-keeperbatter Dhruv Jurel at No. 5, they can have the best of both worlds as it allows them the option of playing four spinners in Washington Sundar, Ravindra Jadeja, Axar Patel, and Kuldeep Yadav.Mind you, Sundar, Jadeja, and Axar are all extremely good batters too, and Kuldeep, who had a long net with the bat, is a good defensive batter as we saw in Ranchi vs England in March 2024, when he and Jurel stitched a series-turning partnership.West Indies find themselves in an unenviable position. They lost three home Tests in the new WTC cycle to Australia, which included a morale-sapping 27 all out in Kingston, Jamaica.Kuldeep did not get a game in the five Tests in England as the team curiously chose to value notional batting depth more than the striking ability that a left-arm wrist spinner can potentially provide. Expect that to change here.India would like to zero in on the No. 3 spot as it became something of a musical chairs event in England. Sai Sudharsan is the favourite to bat there, but the Tamil Nadu batter was seen having treatment on the shoulder and did not bat on match-eve. If he misses out, Devdutt Padikkal could be a suitable replacement.Openers Yashasvi Jaiswal and KL Rahul are a lock-in, having prospered in England with skipper Gill expected to bat at No. 4, where he scored 754 runs in England.","India face West Indies in the first Test at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad on Thursday.

India to play their first home Test without Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma | A new era begins!

Poll Do you agree with Shubman Gill's approach to move away from spin-dominated pitches in Test matches? Yes, it's a great idea No, spin-friendly wickets are essential Unsure, need to see results

WORKLOAD MANAGEMENT QUESTIONS RAISED AGAIN

American businessman and the founder of Amazon once said, “If you’re not stubborn, you’ll give up on experiments too soon. And if you’re not flexible, you’ll pound your head against the wall and you won’t see a different solution to a problem you’re trying to solve. ”Indian Test captain Shubman Gill seems to be a believer in that philosophy. Without saying it in as many words, he gave enough indications that India decided to move away from their preference for rank turners, a nonnegotiable under previous captains like Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma , while playing Test matches at home.Playing on Bunsen burners like Indore, Pune and Mumbai resulted in ego-shattering losses and dwindling batting averages of star players, though it also helped the team conjure home wins to make two WTC finals.Speaking to the media before the first Test against West Indies, Gill, while admitting the team is juggling between the thoughts of playing a third seamer due to the grassy surface or sticking to the quality and potency that the four spinners in the fifteen offer, said, “I can’t really speak about what were the conversations before I came in as captain, but yes, we would be looking to play on wickets that offer help to both batters and bowlers.In short, what he meant was the team would like to play on truer surfaces that saw them compete marvellously in England in a famous 2-2 draw and a series in which Gill amassed 754 runs in five Tests, all of them lasting five days.Gill, though, feels that overseas teams should still be tested by spin and reverse swing, two attributes that are a given in red-ball cricket in India. But he wants the Tests to be more of an oldfashioned long read and not a quick story or reel posted on Instagram.“We are looking to play hard, grinding cricket. Over the past few years, Test matches in India haven’t really lasted for five days. What we are looking to do is to play some good hard cricket. All the Test matches that we played in England went pretty deep. We wouldn’t be looking for any easy options,” Gill stressed, his words echoing clarity, just like his plans while batting.That clarity seemed to have gone missing when he batted in the nets on Tuesday as he either edged or played and missed. His stint on Wednesday though was more serene and unhurried. His flow was better, the rhythm was there, and the defence was tight.What did he hope to achieve in the two net sessions to help him switch back to Test mode? “I was just looking to work on defence and trying to get in the zone. Switching formats is more mental than about technique.”Gill stressed, though, that adjusting from the longer formats to the shorter one is an easier switch.So, how does he do it? “I just try to get in the zone. That zone is nothing for me. Just watching the ball well and being able to decide the areas where I can defend and attack and showing the requisite patience to be able to stick to that process,” Gill said.India’s workload management policy surrounding Jasprit Bumrah sparked debate during the five-match Test series in England, where Bumrah had stated beforehand that he would only be able to play in three of the five games. Some even criticised the move.For a player who skipped Test matches and then played in the T20 Asia Cup, which many consider a low-hanging fruit, Bumrah’s management has triggered even more intrigue.Indian skipper Shubman Gill was asked if Bumrah would play both Tests against the West Indies. Gill’s answer was unspecific. “We’re going to take a call on a match-tomatch basis depending on how long a Test match goes on and how many overs our fast bowlers bowl,” he said.","Shubman Gill wants India to play 'hard, grinding cricket' in Test matches. India will play their first home Test without Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma.

Poll How do you view the current status of West Indies cricket? In a rebuilding phase On the rise In decline Stable

West Indies captain Roston Chase was born in March 1992. By that time, the West Indies were unbeaten in a Test series for 16 years, a run that lasted until the 1994-95 series against Australia.“Champion outfit,” “legends,” “greats,” were the words he would have grown up listening to as he took his first steps and heard stories about the aura surrounding West Indies cricket.The side he will be leading out on the park on Thursday is ranked eighth. He knows his side will be up against it.“Obviously we’re not in a good position right now in terms of our Test status, and we are kind of low on the WTC table, but we have to put that behind us,” Chase told the media on match-eve.“New Zealand came last year and dominated India, so we are really trying to learn from what they did. The analyst has sent the footage of the New Zealand series, and we really zoned in on the critical points that we want to focus on. I’ve played in India before, and I know that its spin-friendly conditions. Spinners may have to bowl more of the overs,” Chase specified.","West Indies captain Roston Chase was born in March 1992.

Australia’s seasoned all-rounder Ashleigh Gardner played a match-winning innings, scoring an unbeaten century, as the defending champions thrashed New Zealand by 89 runs in their ICC Women’s World Cup opener on Wednesday. Gardner’s 115-run knock came off just 77 balls and marked her second ODI century, rescuing Australia from a middle-order wobble and helping them post a formidable 326 all out in 49.3 overs after electing to bat first.The Australian bowling attack, led by Annabel Sutherland (3/26) and supported by the spin duo of Alana King (2/44) and Sophie Molineux (3/25), then restricted New Zealand to 237 in 43.2 overs, securing a comprehensive win.New Zealand captain Sophie Devine fought valiantly, scoring 111 off 112 balls, featuring 12 fours and three sixes, but the chase of 327 proved beyond the White Ferns. The visitors suffered an early collapse, losing two wickets without scoring in the first 1.3 overs, including a run-out mix-up between Georgia Plimmer and Suzie Bates.Despite some resistance from Devine and Brooke Halliday (28), who added 52 for the fourth wicket, New Zealand struggled to keep pace with the required run rate.By the 35th over, they were 164/5, needing over 10 runs per over. Devine’s partnership with Isabella Gaze offered glimpses of hope, but the effort fell short as Devine was dismissed in the 43rd over.Australia’s innings had begun brightly, with Alyssa Healy (19) and Phoebe Litchfield (45) providing a brisk start, though early wickets brought the team to 113/4 by the 19th over. Gardner then took control, building crucial partnerships of 64 with Tahlia McGrath (26) and 69 with Kim Garth (38), steering Australia to a strong total.From 252/7 after 40 overs, Australia added 74 more runs, eventually being bowled out in the 50th over. Jess Kerr claimed three late wickets for New Zealand, but the target had long been out of reach.Gardner’s commanding innings and a disciplined bowling performance ensured Australia began their World Cup title defense in emphatic fashion, sending a strong message to the competition.","Defending champions thrashed New Zealand by 89 runs.

NEW DELHI: Former India off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin went unsold at the ILT20 2025 auction in Dubai, despite entering the bidding with a base price of USD 120,000. The 38-year-old veteran’s snub took many by surprise, given his stellar career as one of India’s most successful match-winners.Ashwin had registered for the UAE-based league following his recent retirement from international cricket and the Indian Premier League, making his availability a notable talking point ahead of the auction.Ashwin enjoyed a stellar IPL career, retiring as a legend after 221 matches across five franchises, making him the seventh most-capped player in the league’s history.A two-time IPL champion with Chennai Super Kings in 2010 and 2011, Ashwin claimed 187 IPL wickets (fifth all-time) and has taken 317 wickets in 333 T20 matches overall.His last IPL auction saw him sold to CSK for a massive INR 9.75 crore, underscoring his value in the shortest format.While the ILT20 auction left him unsold, Ashwin has already signed for Big Bash League (BBL) Season 15, where he will represent the Sydney Thunder. This move makes him the first male cricketer who has played for the Indian national team to join a BBL club.“Indian legend Ravichandran Ashwin has created history, joining Sydney Thunder for BBL|15.

NEW DELHI: Opener Atharva Taide made full use of his opportunities, scoring a composed unbeaten century to steer Vidarbha to 280/5 on the opening day of the Irani Cup clash against Rest of India (ROI) on Wednesday. Taide remained unbeaten on 118 off 240 balls, while Yash Rathod played a crucial supporting role with 91 off 153 balls (6 fours, 1 six), the pair rescuing their side after an early collapse.The Ranji Trophy champions got off to a brisk start, racing to 40 without loss in seven overs, but quickly lost momentum as three wickets fell in quick succession, leaving them 80/3.Taide survived a huge scare early on when he was bowled by Akash Deep on the first ball of the second over, only for the delivery to be called a no-ball. The pacer soon struck, removing Aman Mokhade (19) caught behind after a successful review.Taide continued to live dangerously — surviving a possible inside edge and a near-catch at slip — as ROI kept the pressure on. Dhruv Shorey was dropped by wicketkeeper Ishan Kishan but was dismissed soon after by spinner Manav Suthar, who also removed Danish Malewar for a duck two balls later, plunging Vidarbha into trouble.It was then that Taide and Rathod stitched together a vital 184-run partnership for the fourth wicket, steadying the innings and frustrating the ROI bowlers.Just as Vidarbha looked in control, Rathod fell nine short of a century, holing out to Gurnoor Brar while attempting a big shot off Suthar in the 74th over.Captain Akshay Wadkar tried to build on the platform with Taide, but their stand lasted just 11 runs before another breakthrough left Vidarbha at 275/5.At stumps, Taide held firm, anchoring the innings with a determined knock that gave Vidarbha a fighting total after a shaky start.","Vidarbha reach 280/5 on the opening day of Irani Cup clash against Rest of India.

What’s common between the three Formula E world champions

How the three World Champions fared in Formula E Season 11

Days after Oliver Rowland lifted his Formula E World Championship trophy in London this season, an interesting trend has come to the attention of Formula E and its fans. As a coincidence, all Formula E drivers who won the Mexico City E-Prix went on to win the Formula E World Championship that season, and this has been proved right for three consecutive years.Highlighting the same since 2023, a poster of three World Champions was shared on X by Formula E with the caption, “The trend continues. Each winner of the #MexicoCityEPrix from the past three seasons has gone on to become World Champion.”The special poster features 2023 Formula E World Champion Jake Dennis from Andretti, then TAG Heuer Porsche’s Pascal Wehrlein, who won in 2024, and the new World Champion, Nissan driver Oliver Rowland. All three of them won in the Mexico E-Prix and went on to lift the winner’s trophy in the Formula E World Championship that year.Oliver Rowland had strengthened his chances of winning the Formula E World Championship this year much earlier. He was leading the Formula E Driver Standings ever since he won Part 2 of the Jeddah E-Prix, which was his second win of the season after winning the Mexico E-Prix. In the last leg, the Nissan driver got nervous for a while as Pascal Wehrlein, who was following him in the number two position, closed the gap after grabbing quite a few podiums while Rowland had a dull period.Things became serious for Rowland when he failed to finish the Round 13 race in Berlin, while Wehrlein won second spot on the podium. But he eventually managed to confirm his championship in Berlin after four wins and three more podiums.Sharing about his bad race in Berlin, Rowland had said, “I was hoping before the weekend that the outcome could be [the World Championship], but after yesterday (Saturday) and this morning (Sunday), I was more worried that it might never come.”Also Read: Oliver Rowland reacts to daughter’s sweet radio message after Formula E Championship win: “It’s amazing” Things, however, changed for Wehrlein, who was pushed to third position after Nick Cassidy made a late entry in the Formula E Driver Standings by registering three consecutive wins.

Wehrlein registered one win and five more podiums this season.Meanwhile, Andretti driver Jake Dennis finished in seventh position in the Formula E Driver Standings.

Taylor Barnard on losing top three spot in Formula E World Championship

Fans hail Taylor Barnard for his fantastic rookie season

It was Taylor Barnard’s rookie season this year, and the NEOM McLaren driver put up a fantastic performance by temporarily making it to the top three in the Formula E Driver Standings by ousting the much more experienced Porsche driver Antonio Felix Da Costa.

We couldn’t have done it without you all — your trust and support have never been taken for granted,” he added.Praising the two McLaren drivers, he wrote, “Sam clinched McLaren’s first-ever fully electric win at the São Paulo E-Prix in Season 10, pulling off one of Formula E’s all-time great overtakes, before being waved across the line by none other than Emerson Fittipaldi – McLaren's first Formula 1 World Champion. While Taylor has been a rookie sensation in Season 11, securing five Formula E records, including the youngest driver to start a race, the youngest points scorer, the youngest driver to lead a lap, the youngest podium finisher, and the youngest polesitter. ”He ended the letter saying, “Some of us have been together since the day we first launched this team, while others have seamlessly fitted in along the way and flourished within the environment we have cultivated.

How do Formula E and ABB work together?

What do ABB and Formula E say about the partnership?

After a successful Season 11, ABB and Formula E have announced that they will continue their partnership in the upcoming season. This gives ABB another opportunity to promote its new brand positioning via the ABB FIA Formula E World Championship, along with technologies that help industries take a cleaner route.Over a period of eight seasons, the partnership with Formula E has provided ABB a platform to showcase how technology can help industries outrun challenges, engage with customers around the world, and implement its own solutions into the series to improve reliability and efficiency. The partnership extension will provide a year-round opportunity for brand-building and activation, communicating ABB and its technology solutions to new global audiences, including Formula E’s international fanbase.ABB and Formula E will also join hands to engage a new generation of fans, collaborating with unexpected influencers and content creators to tell compelling stories that make advanced electrification and automation technologies tangible and exciting.The end of the mid-race car swap, a 150kW increase in power, top speeds that are 43 percent higher, and energy recovery increasing from 15 to 50 percent indicate how far Formula E technology has come to outperform on track.ABB has also built on its technical involvement in the series, supplying the race chargers from Season 9, and introducing its ABB Ability OPTIMAX® energy management software (Season 9) and Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) technology (Season 5) to the sport.ABB Head of Brand Paco Liebrand said, “We are pleased to be continuing our partnership with Formula E which, like ABB, is striving for a leaner and cleaner future. The synergy between the two organizations, combined with the global appeal of the Championship, makes it a great platform to promote our brand positioning.”He further said, “Formula E is increasingly working with content creators, influencers, and celebrities, with initiatives such as the Evo Sessions making an impact through digital channels beyond the racing itself, which is also an essential part of ABB’s new brand strategy. Going forward, we will be enhancing the way we harness the benefits of this collaboration, ensuring the focus is on delivering content and activations that reinforce our new messaging, build familiarity, and tell the ‘Engineered to Outrun’ story. ”Formula E Chief Revenue Officer Tiziana Di Gioia said, “Our renewed partnership with ABB is a testament to the commercial power and benefit of Formula E as a global platform that drives both brand and business growth. ABB, like our wider partnership portfolio, has and continues to see enormous value in collaborating with the fastest-growing motorsport on the planet, with viewership, commercial integration, and brand storytelling continuing to accelerate. Over eight seasons, ABB has moved from brand visibility to brand activation—integrating deeply into the fan experience, the sport’s ecosystem, and our innovation narrative.Also Read: Antonio Felix Da Costa shares happy memories as Porsche wins Formula E Teams and Manufacturers’ World Championships “This next chapter elevates the partnership even further. With ABB’s new positioning, we are co-creating opportunities across content, digital storytelling, and market engagement, transforming a title partnership into a year-round, value-generating relationship. It’s a model of how modern sponsorships should evolve, rooted in purpose and cultural alignment but measured by impact,” she added.Formula E Season 12 will begin with testing in Valencia in October.","ABB and Formula E have announced that they will continue their partnership in the upcoming season.

WATCH:

Coco Gauff staged a remarkable comeback to beat Belinda Bencic 4-6, 7-6 (7/4), 6-2 in a tense China Open round of 16 clash on Tuesday, a match remembered as much for a fiery on-court outburst as for elite-level tennis.The drama unfolded during a changeover in the second set, with Bencic accusing Gauff’s team of deliberately disrupting her focus.“When I’m going to the line ready to serve, they don’t need to cheer,” the Swiss star complained to the chair umpire. The 25-year-old continued, snapping at Gauff herself: “No one’s talking to you. She’s talking to me, okay! I’m too old for these mind games!”Gauff, just a few feet away, tried to interject, but Bencic’s sharp rebuke dominated the confrontation. The tense exchange was captured in a video that quickly went viral, illustrating the psychological intensity of elite tennis.The incident appeared to affect Bencic more than Gauff. After dropping the first set and trailing in the second, Gauff regrouped, winning a tight tiebreak as Bencic double-faulted on set point and hurled her racquet in frustration. The American teenager carried that momentum into the decider, breaking early and racing to a 6-2 victory.“It was a tough match,” Gauff said post-game. “I had chances in the first to close it out, but I’m happy with how I fought. She was really aggressive.”The win not only secured Gauff a spot in the China Open quarter-finals but also confirmed her qualification for the WTA Finals in Riyadh this November. She will next face either Germany’s Eva Lys or fellow American McCartney Kessler.","Coco Gauff beats Belinda Bencic 4-6, 7-6 (7/4), 6-2 in China Open round of 16 clash.

Croatian tennis legend Nikola Pilic, the pioneering coach who trained Novak Djokovic and the only captain to lead three countries to Davis Cup glory, has died at the age of 86, the Croatian Tennis Association announced on Tuesday. Pilic passed away on Monday in the western Croatian town of Opatija.Born in Split in 1939, Pilic began representing the Yugoslav youth national team just four years after starting tennis. He went on to dominate national competitions, winning five Yugoslav singles titles, seven doubles crowns, and one mixed doubles championship. His greatest achievement on the court came in 1973 when he finished runner-up at the French Open to Ilie Nastase. He also claimed the US Open doubles title in 1970 alongside Pierre Barthes.Pilic was already a prominent figure when tennis turned professional in 1968, becoming one of the first eight men, dubbed the “Handsome Eight,” to sign with Lamar Hunt’s World Championship Tennis tour. He reached a career-high singles ranking of No. 6 and won nine singles titles along the way.Off the court, Pilic’s influence was even greater. After retiring in 1978, he enjoyed a distinguished coaching career, leading Germany to Davis Cup triumphs in 1988, 1989, and 1993, guiding Croatia to victory in 2005, and serving as an adviser when Serbia won in 2010.His academy near Munich nurtured future stars including Michael Stich, Goran Ivanisevic, and Novak Djokovic, who affectionately called Pilic his “tennis dad.” In 1999, Djokovic’s first coach Jelena Gencic sent the young player to train under Pilic, shaping the foundation for his 24 Grand Slam titles.“Nikola Niki Pilic will be remembered as the only captain ever to lead three different nations to Davis Cup titles,” the Croatian Tennis Association said. His contributions were recognised with a Lifetime Achievement Award from Croatia in 2019 and Serbia’s Gold Medal of Merit in 2020.",Croatian tennis legend Nikola Pilic has died at the age of 86.

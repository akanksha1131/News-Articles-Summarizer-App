The star batter, who has played just one Test in Brisbane without reward back in 2014, is fussing over his technique, putting in the hard yards & rallying the rest as India seek batting edge in crucial third Test...

IND vs AUS: India batting has been a major cause of worry

This Virat Kohli is like Sachin Tendulkar of 2011-13

BRISBANE: Step out of the Queensland Cricketers' Club members dining area and there's a unique vantage point right above the Gabba nets, offering a bird's eye view of the proceedings below.For those watching from here, through the four intense hours that India's top six sweated it out in sweltering heat and alarming UV levels, it was clear this batting unit is trying extremely hard to get its act together following the shellacking in Adelaide.Everybody, from KL Rahul to Rohit Sharma , put in the hard yards on Thursday but it was Virat Kohli who perfectly epitomized this renewed focus. He was a bundle of batting energy, hopping from one net to the other, facing pace, then more pace, fronting up against spin before spending a long time working on his technique and body position while facing throwdowns from the sidearm, or 'throwdown stick' as the Aussies call it.Kohli seemed a man on a mission even before hitting the hits, giving a long pep talk to the youngsters along with vice-captain Jasprit Bumrah , getting in some decent slip-catching practice before going deep within himself to iron out some perceived flaws.It was like watching a past master's frantic attempts to clear the cobwebs of the mind, to try and rediscover the poise and decisiveness of youth. Kohli is still very fit and far from being a spent force, of course. He has already done his bit as the series hits the halfway stage, having hit a century as India won in Perth. But he knows a decisive knock or two under pressure is what the team needs most from him.It is here, at the Gabba, with India on the ropes, that Kohli will be itching to contribute. He has played just once here and not done well. He knows the team is staring at either an early transition, or a delayed one if veterans like him and Rohit Sharma can rage against the dying of the light a bit longer. The transition will happen, nonetheless.For the moment, in the here and now, the spotlight is firmly on them. After the Perth ton, Kohli had said, ""I'm not the sort of guy who wants to hang around just for the sake of it. I just want to contribute to the team's cause.""In Perth, Kohli enjoyed the cushion of runs, with India already 321 ahead when he came out to the middle. He didn't have that cushion in Adelaide and faltered.In Perth, Kohli had the time to get his eye in before unleashing a range of strokes when he realized the team was waiting for him to get to three figures before declaring. In Adelaide, he was caught in two minds whether to reach out to a Mitchell Starc delivery, play or leave, and paid the price. In his second stint it was Scott Boland and again that nagging length, and the star batsman only managed to edge it to the 'keeper.In recent times, Kohli has had a tendency to commit on the front foot, but in Perth he used the depth of the crease well against the likes of Nathan Lyon. In the Brisbane nets on Thursday, he faced problems against deliveries just short of full length, playing and missing or edging against the likes of Jasprit Bumrah, Akash Deep and Mukesh Kumar.Lately, Kohli has found surprising ways to get out, like the Mitchell Santner full toss during the home series against New Zealand. Is it an eyesight thing? Are the trigger movements slow er? Only Kohli would know for sure, but it's possible to draw a distinct line at the point where the consistency starts to taper off—for someone who averaged 54.97 from 2011-19 and scored 27 Test tons, the years from 2020 till date have fetched him only three centuries and an average of 32.14. That's a steep decline, although he has still been impressive overseas of late.Kohli, then, has to break new ground at the Gabba, but he's not the only one. In India's last five Tests, against Australia here and New Zealand at home, the whole top six has collectively averaged a poor 27.47. Take just the last seven overseas Tests, and their collective average rises to 35.39. In Australia so far, across the two Tests, the top six averages only 28.13 across 24 innings, in spite of centuries from Yashasvi Jaiswal and Kohli.To make a strong comeback here, this team must find that elusive quality of consistency. Simply put, India must bat long. As Rohit Sharma had said after the defeat in the pink-ball Test, ""When you come to Australia the best chance of winning a Test match is by putting runs on the board."" Can Kohli inspire a top-six turnaround?","Virat Kohli has played just one Test in Brisbane without reward back in 2014. The star batter is fussing over his technique, putting in the hard yards & rallying the rest as India seek batting edge in crucial third Test.

How can India still qualify for World Test Championship final?

BRISBANE: Steve Smith is discovering, just like Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli before this tour to Australia, that extreme home conditions are not always conducive to late-career batting revivals.Both luck and form seem to have deserted Smith this year and without a turnaround at the Gabba, he risks falling into the rabbit hole of endless technical tweaks as the pressure grows to deliver.India's ageing stalwarts have discovered this the hard way, with the turning tracks at home negating any possibility of notching up high scores, like we saw in the series against New Zealand.After the Adelaide defeat, Rohit had said, ""We accept that when we play in India, we are trying to play in very difficult conditions. It's our choice and we know the big scores are not going to happen. But whenever we travel abroad the conditions are there to score runs.""It's unlikely Smith will agree Australian conditions are still batting-friendly, given the recent tendency to maximize advantage for the pacers at home, especially against teams from the subcontinent. Translating meagre returns at home to a windfall abroad isn't always easy either, especially when a string of low scores keeps playing on the mind or becomes a national obsession.Never the most orthodox of batters, Smith has had a horror run in 2024, averaging 23.2 from seven Tests. The drop in returns has been gradual-in his last 23 Tests he averages 35.75, and although his overall batting average stands at 56.09, the alarm bells have started ringing across Australia.In Perth in the first innings, he fell first ball to a monster of a delivery from Bumrah, and in the second he was hanging on until Siraj got one to straighten off the seam and take the edge. In Adelaide, the ill fortune continued as he tickled one down leg.At 35, Smith's best days are probably behind him, but if he gets going he can still punish India in this series. Teammate Mitchell Marsh , for one, is hoping for just such a turnaround.""We know he's one of our best players ever and I'm certainly backing him to get some runs,"" Marsh said here on Thursday. ""I'm probably not in a position to tell Steve Smith what he should work on. We know he's a class player and he's scored a lot of runs for Australia. At times when we've needed him, he always seems to step up.""Smith, who hit the nets with gusto here on Thursday, has already shunted himself up and down the order in recent times to get the runs-going on to open and then making a hasty return to his favourite No. 4 spot.With Jasprit Bumrah waiting to pounce, his job won't get any easier. But it's Smith, and India can't write him off till he faces his last ball of the series.","Steve Smith has had a horror run in 2024, averaging 23.2 from seven Tests.

How can India still qualify for World Test Championship final?

This Virat Kohli is like Sachin Tendulkar of 2011-13

Australia’s star batter Steve Smith is rethinking his training approach to combat a recent dip in form. He's adopted a ""less is more"" strategy, inspired by advice from former teammate Mike Hussey .Smith's performance has been under scrutiny, with only 19 runs across three innings in the first two Tests against India. This has raised concerns, especially given his return to his preferred number four batting position.Smith consulted Hussey, renowned for his late-career success, which included eight Test centuries after turning 35. Hussey suggested that reduced training could be more beneficial for older players.""It's well documented that him and Marnus (Labuschagne) in particular, they hit a lot of balls, they practise really hard and they do a great deal of preparation,"" Hussey said.Hussey’s advice stemmed from his own experience of maintaining peak performance later in his career. He emphasized the importance of mental and physical freshness over extensive training.""And I just said (to Smith), 'It's worth just thinking about how much you hit, and is it actually helping you, or is it slightly detrimental?'"" Hussey added.He elaborated on his philosophy, contrasting the needs of younger and older players. Younger players benefit from high training volume, while older players benefit from prioritizing freshness.""I think as a young player, volume is really important. But as you get older, I certainly found from my own perspective, it wasn't about hitting more balls and working yourself into the ground. It was more about coming into games as mentally and physically fresh as you possibly can."" Hussey explained.Smith implemented Hussey's suggestion by skipping a training session before the Adelaide Test. He aimed to enter the match feeling refreshed. Unfortunately, the strategy didn't immediately pay off. Smith was dismissed for only two runs, caught off a Jasprit Bumrah delivery.""In an ideal world, I probably wouldn't hit as many balls as I do in the lead-up,"" Smith admitted.Smith acknowledged that while less training is generally preferable, he sometimes needs extra sessions to address specific technical aspects. He finds himself caught between the two approaches.""It's just if I need to feel a bit better with something or work on a certain movement or whatever, I might need that last session."" Smith clarified.Smith's recent dismissals, particularly against Indian pace bowlers, have sparked debate about his defensive technique. Smith remains determined to find the optimal balance in his training and batting approach. He's analyzing the techniques of successful batsmen on challenging wickets.""In the last two years or so, while the wickets have been tricky, the guys getting runs are probably the ones going harder at the ball, almost keeping their bodies out of the way, giving themselves room in a way, and hitting hard and scoring quickly,"" Smith observed.He highlighted Travis Head and Mitch Marsh as examples of players who have adapted well to difficult batting conditions. He's seeking to incorporate elements of their approach into his own game.""For me, there's a balance. Obviously, you've got to try and put the bowler under some kind of pressure and try and dictate terms a little bit. But that can be tricky on those sorts of wickets as well."" Smith concluded.","Steve Smith is rethinking his training approach to combat a recent dip in form. He's adopted a ""less is more"" strategy, inspired by advice from former teammate Mike Hussey.

The West Indies completed a dominant 3-0 clean sweep over Bangladesh in their ODI series after a thrilling four-wicket victory in the final match in St. Kitts on Thursday. Debutant Amir Jangoo delivered a sensational performance, becoming only the second West Indian to score a century on ODI debut, finishing unbeaten on 104 off 83 balls.Chasing a daunting target of 322, the hosts found themselves in trouble early, losing three wickets within the first five overs. Sherfane Rutherford steadied the innings briefly with a knock of 30 before being dismissed by Taskin Ahmed. Jangoo then partnered with Keacy Carty in a game-changing 132-run stand.Carty fell agonizingly short of his second ODI century, dismissed for 95 after a sharp catch by Soumya Sarkar off Rishad Hossain. Jangoo, however, kept his composure and brought up his maiden ton with a towering six. Supported by Gudakesh Motie, who added an unbeaten 44, Jangoo guided the West Indies to victory with four overs to spare.Earlier, Bangladesh produced their best batting display of the series, amassing 321/5 in 50 overs. Soumya Sarkar (73) and Mehidy Hasan Miraz (77) laid a solid foundation, while a record unbroken sixth-wicket stand of 150 between Mahmudullah (84 not out) and Jaker Ali (62 not out) gave the visitors a competitive total.Despite their efforts, the bowlers struggled to contain the West Indies' chase. Jangoo's remarkable debut innings ensured the Caribbean side sealed their first ODI series whitewash over a Test-playing nation since their 3-0 win against Sri Lanka in 2021.The victory marked a memorable milestone for the West Indies, highlighting the team's potential and the emergence of fresh talent on the international stage.","West Indies complete 3-0 clean sweep over Bangladesh in ODI series.

NEW DELHI: Dynamic English top-order batter Tom Kohler-Cadmore is all set to return for the third edition of the ILT20 , representing the Sharjah Warriorz .With a reputation for explosive batting across global T20 leagues , Kohler-Cadmore is determined to lead his team to a breakthrough season in the region’s premier T20 competition.The Sharjah Warriorz have yet to secure a playoff spot in the tournament, but Kohler-Cadmore remains optimistic. As one of only two players to score a century in the league’s history, he is focused on driving the team’s success.""I think for us, it's about trying to qualify. We've had two disappointing seasons so far, so if we can qualify and make sure we get into the knockouts, I think that'll be good for us. Personally, I just want to contribute to as many wins as I can,"" he said.Acknowledging the high level of competition with nine international players allowed in each XI, Kohler-Cadmore emphasized the importance of consistency.""It's really tough to keep performing.

There are no easy bowlers to face or batters to dot up and restrict, so it is about always bringing ‘A’ game and ensuring you as a team remain on top,"" he added.Reflecting on the team’s performance in Season 2, where they managed eight points in ten matches, the Englishman identified home-ground adaptability as a key focus. ""I think it's about finding a way to be successful at home. We play a lot of games at Sharjah, and the scores are lower, so it's about making sure we find ways as a unit and for myself to play on the slower pitches, and to be able to post a score that's challenging,"" he explained.""I felt last year we went too hard trying to get scores that were too big instead of actually just getting a competitive score,” he further added.Kohler-Cadmore also praised local talents like Muhammad Jawadullah and Junaid Siddique, who have grown into pivotal bowlers for the team.""I think this is a great platform for them to stand up and show how good they are. We've been lucky to have Junaid and Jawadullah with us, they have become two of our frontline seamers over the last couple of seasons. It's been amazing watching Jawadullah grow, — we weren’t sure what we were going to get but when he came out for games, he absolutely starred for us, that is the beauty of these competitions, you always manage to find young talent and watch their careers grow,” he noted.Kohler-Cadmore expressed confidence and gratitude toward fans, saying, “Keep supporting us, and hopefully, we’ll bring the trophy home this year.”Sharjah Warriorz will kick off their campaign against the Gulf Giants on 12 January 2025.","Tom Kohler-Cadmore is one of only two players to score a century in the league’s history.

MUMBAI: Former India women's team captain Mithali Raj , who was the mentor of the Gujarat Giants (GG) in the first two editions of the Women's Premier League (WPL), has parted ways with the franchise ahead of the tournament's third edition, which is slated to be held in February 2025.The Adani Group-owned Gujarat Giants, who were the most expensive team of the WPL, finished fifth and last in both editions of the tournament. In fact, their performance has been the worst amongst the five franchises in WPL-they have lost 12 matches, and won just four in 16 outings.The WPL mini-auction will be held in Bengaluru on December 15.In November, Mithali took up the role of mentor of Women's Cricket Operations of Andhra Cricket Association.Also out of the Gautam Adani-owned franchise is former India off-spinner Nooshin Al Khadeer , who was the team's assistant coach for the first two seasons. Al Khadeer is currently the head coach of the India Under-19 women's team that will play in the second edition of the Under-19 World Cup to be held in Malaysia early next year, with India set to defend their title.On Thursday, Gujarat Giants announced that former Australian cricketer Daniel Marsh and ex-Mumbai and Rajasthan Royals leg-spinner Pravin Tambe, who made his debut for RR at the age of 41 in what is an inspirational story, had come on board as their batting and bowling coaches, while former South Australia batter Michael Klinger continues to remain their head coach.Tambe is still remembered for the hat-trick that he took for the Rajasthan Royals in their Indian Premier League clash against the Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) in IPL 2014. The tweaker had dismissed Manish Pandey, Yusuf Pathan and Ryan ten Doeschate to spark the Royals' 10-run win. Tambe has previously worked with IPL teams Kolkata Knight Riders and Lucknow Super Giants.""Joining Gujarat Giants as the bowling coach is an exciting new chapter in my cricketing journey. I’m eager to work with this talented group of players to sharpen their skills and help them excel,"" Tambe said in a statement.""We laid solid groundwork last season, and I'm excited to build on that with the talented players we have retained in the squad. Our focus remains on fostering a winning mindset and pushing the boundaries of what we can achieve as a team.

MUMBAI: A heartening feature of Mumbai's so far successful campaign in the Syed Mushtaq Ali T20 Trophy - they will play Baroda in the semifinals on Friday at 11am - has been the emergence of young turk Suryansh Shedge as a reliable finisher-a destructive power-hitter who can send the bowlers to the cleaners in the death overs.Twice in a row at SMAT now, Shedge, batting at No 6, has churned out blazing cameos which have helped Mumbai chase down 200-plus totals easily and seal a win from the jaws of defeat.In the must-win last league match against Andhra at Hyderabad, Mumbai, chasing a tall target of 230, were in a spot of bother when Shedge blasted an unbeaten 30 off just eight balls, in an effort which included three sixes and two fours to take Mumbai home in a record chase without much fuss.In the quarterfinals against Vidarbha at Alur on Wednesday, Mumbai again looked down and out at one point, before Shedge exploded with a power-packed 36 not out off merely 12 balls, this time hitting four sixes and a four. Thanks to the 21-year-old's hurricane, unbeaten 67-run partnership with experienced allrounder Shivam Dube, Mumbai romped home to a six-wicket win.In the four innings (he has played in all the seven matches for Mumbai) that he has batted in so far in SMAT, Shedge has rustled up an astounding strike rate of 247.22-never mind his average of 29.66 or overall runs tally (89).In the Ranji Trophy this season, Shedge provided proof of his unique ability when he smashed 99 off 93 balls against Assam at Guwahati, and then thumped 79 not out off just 36 balls, including six sixes, as Mumbai looked to declare in quick time against Odisha at the Mumbai Cricket Association's ground in BKC.Shedge first shot into limelight back in 2016 as a 13-year-old, when he smashed the fastest triple century in the history of the Giles Shield cricket tournament, scoring a blistering 326 off just 137 balls for the Gundecha Education Academy against SPSS Mumbadevi Niketan.A Bandra boy, Shedge owes his power-hitting skills to some useful training sessions in this regard with India's assistant coach Abhishek Nayar and Monty Desai , currently Nepal's head coach. ""Abhishek Nayar sir and Monty sir have helped me a lot when it comes to power hitting… giving me different drills to try and a good perspective on power hitting. They and Manish Bangera (childhood coach) are my important coaches and mentors,"" Shedge told TOI from Alur on Friday.Interestingly, the explosive allrounder develops his power-hitting by training in multiple grounds in Mumbai. ""I try to practice at different locations, and not just at one place. That helps a lot when you play in different conditions across Mumbai,"" he said.The young gun takes immense pride in wearing the Mumbai shirt. ""The MCA has backed me since a very young age. It gives me immense pride to play for the best team in India. In turn, I’ve built competitiveness and the hunger to win games. My team comes first, we play to win,"" he said with pride in his voice. Bought by the Punjab Kings at his base price of Rs 30 lakhs, Shedge, who was a part of Lucknow Super Giants could be the franchise's latest rising star if given proper opportunity.Showering praise on his ward, Monty Desai told TOI, ""Having known Suryansh since he was 11, I've witnessed his abilities, drive, and hunger evolve into a free-flowing batting style that is a joy to watch. But behind every young talent is the unwavering support of parents who endure the rollercoaster of emotions in their child's journey.

It is my privilege to keep guiding and mentoring him, encouraging him to stay connected to the deepest sense of his identity - grinding and staying grounded while showcasing his skills fearlessly, with flair and finesse. Yet, it's still a long way ahead - a journey of continuous learning and growth to build a true champion mindset,"" Desai felt.","Mumbai's Suryansh Shedge is a destructive power-hitter who can send the bowlers to the cleaners in the death overs.

'Rohit Sharma must return to opening if...': Ravi Shastri,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/india-in-australia/rohit-sharma-must-return-to-opening-if-ravi-shastri/articleshow/116256117.cms,"IND vs AUS: Rohit Sharma has had a terrible time with the bat in whites

How can India still qualify for World Test Championship final?

Former Indian coach Ravi Shastri has offered his perspective on the ongoing India-Australia Test series. Shastri, who oversaw India's historic Test series wins in Australia in 2017-18 and 2020-21, believes Rohit Sharma should return to his opening position.Shastri was the team director during India's first-ever Test series victory in Australia and the head coach during their second triumph. He suggests that Rohit's optimal batting position is as an opener.India lost the second Test in Adelaide by 10 wickets. This defeat leveled the five-match series at 1-1. Shastri believes the third Test will be pivotal.""That's where he's (Rohit) been at his best over the last eight or nine years,"" Shastri was quoted as saying by 'The Age'.""It's not that he's going to set the world on fire – he could – but that's the place that's best for him...If he has to do damage, if he has to throw the first punch, that's the best place from where he can do it.""Prior to the second Test, Rohit had only one fifty in his last ten innings. Interestingly, Shastri had initially advised against changing the opening combination of Yashasvi Jaiswal and KL Rahul He also supported the idea of Rohit batting in the middle order at that time. Shastri now firmly believes that the winner of the third Test, commencing on Saturday, will likely win the series.""I feel whichever team wins this Test match will win the series. I have absolutely no doubt in my mind. So it is very, very important that India get the balance right, because Australia have got the confidence back.""Shastri highlighted the importance of India finding the right balance, especially considering Australia's regained confidence. He spoke at the first annual Usman Khawaja Foundation lunch at the Gabba.He reflected on India's 2021 series win, considering it one of the greatest achievements in Indian cricket history. He emphasized the team's unity amidst COVID-19 restrictions as a key factor in their success.""In COVID, the first Test match you start with five bowlers and the same five bowlers don't play the last Test. That says it all, it's like Australia playing without these five bowlers in the last Test of the series, it's a different ball game. Plus you didn't have quite a few batsmen as well. So it's a tribute to the players.""Shastri praised the players for their resilience and performance under challenging circumstances. He acknowledged the limitations of a coach's role and emphasized the players' contribution to the victory.""You can only do so much as a coach from behind the scenes. At the end of it, it's the players who have to go out there and do their job and they were magnificent.""India suffered a heavy defeat in Adelaide on the last tour, being bowled out for their lowest ever Test score of 36. However, they made a remarkable comeback to win the series. Shastri recalled a conversation between Rishabh Pant and Shubman Gill during the final Test at the Gabba.""I'll never forget it,"" Shastri said.""Last session, 140 runs to get. We had two different change rooms because of COVID. I went down from the coaches' room to have a chat with either Rishabh or (Chateshwar) Pujara. When I was about to reach the toilet, I heard a conversation between Gill and Pant.""Seventy-one overs bowled, Gill had got out for 91, and they were the two youngest players in the side, 21 and 22. 'Nine overs left, they need the new ball, they'll bring (Marnus) Labuschagne on with his leg spin, you've got to score 45-50 runs there'.""They are planning how they can reach closer to the end score, and no way was I going to stop them, I don't want to change that mindset. So I just walked past and said 'do what you have to do'. In the end, we chased down nearly 150 in that last session.""",India lost the second Test in Adelaide by 10 wickets.

'Follow Sachin Tendulkar's approach': Sunil Gavaskar's key tips to Virat Kohli,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/india-in-australia/follow-sachin-tendulkars-approach-sunil-gavaskars-key-tips-to-virat-kohli/articleshow/116254181.cms,"(AP Photo)

Is India's batting now over dependent on Yashasvi Jaiswal?

This Virat Kohli is like Sachin Tendulkar of 2011-13

NEW DELHI: The legendary Sunil Gavaskar has come up with a piece of advice for struggling Virat Kohli , whose weakness against deliveries outside the off-stump continues to trouble him in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy .Gavaskar advised Kohli to refrain from playing deliveries outside the off-stump until he settles in at the crease. He also highlighted that the opposition quickly identifies his approach and adjusts their field placements accordingly.""This approach should be that in the beginning, when you are not set, you should not go for a lunge until you are settled. Look, in the first innings, the shot played went over the top,"" Gavaskar told Star Sports.""Now, the Australian players must have noticed, when they came for the second innings, they placed a fielder there, so he needs to manage that. If he plays straight, he is good enough to hit between mid-on, mid-wicket, and straight if he just concentrates,"" he added.Gavaskar also urged Kohli to adopt Sachin Tendulkar 's approach, where he refrained from playing any shots outside the off-stump, a strategy that helped him score nearly 250 runs against Australia in Sydney.""Just like Sachin Tendulkar did in Sydney, in the previous three Test matches, he was getting out outside the off-stump, caught in the covers, or in the slips. He didn't play even one cover drive, only played straight and scored around two hundred and fifty runs by controlling himself and deciding not to play there. If he plays like this, just as Sachin scored a double century, Kohli can also do the same.""Gavaskar also feels Australia will have the momentum in the third Test against India starting on Saturday thanks to their victory in the Pink Ball Test at Adelaide last week.""The momentum that the Indian team got in Perth was lost during the 10-day gap. Now, the momentum is with Australia because they have won this Test match,"" Gavaskar said.""After the Adelaide Test, a few days later, you are playing at The Gabba. So, the momentum is now with the Australian team,"" he added.","Sunil Gavaskar says Virat Kohli should refrain from playing deliveries outside the off-stump until he settles in at the crease.

'No impact player rule' in SA20

Amid the influx of T20 leagues and the cramped calendar as a result, getting a clean window to rope in the best of talents is a challenge. Indian Premier League (IPL) with its big money is the biggest T20 league by a distance. It leaves the door ajar for the others to make a mark of their own. Australia's Big Bash League (BBL), Bangladesh Premier League (BPL), West Indies' Caribbean Premier League (CPL) and Pakistan Super League (PSL) are some of the most sought after.Slowly but gradually, South Africa's SA20 has also risen up the charts, with clear ambitions and backing of IPL franchises. Durban Super Giants, Joburg Super Kings, MI Cape Town, Paarl Royals, Pretoria Capitals and Sunrisers Eastern Cape all have support of IPL owners.The league, too, is not shying away from acknowledging that IPL is well and truly ahead of the rest but they hope to learn from its success. SA20 league commissioner and former cricketer Graeme Smith labelled the IPL as 'incredible'.SA20 Ambassador and former all-rounder Jacques Kallis said the reason the league has done well over the two editions is because the teams are evenly matched with quality players on display.""Obviously the product of the IPL is on the next level, your quality of players, your audience it's just streets ahead of anything else at the moment. We're trying to get the league (SA20) to as close as possible to IPL and make it a really exciting product, (something) that people want to watch. It's also key to have really strong teams. I think that's where they have done well, that is strength-versus-strength, and you got the best players coming over and attracting as many world class players as your overseas players as possible,"" he said in response to a query fromThe quality of the cricket and the spectacle was truly embraced by the locals as 3,80,000 people came through the turnstiles during the second season.""People want to see strength-versus-strength. They want to see the best players in South Africa and world class overseas players. And that's what this product has produced. And we've seen that people will come and watch it when the cricket's good. There's lots of other entertainment. So, it's good value. It's the format (that) allows you to bring the whole family to come and watch. So it's inclusive of all, which, you know, makes it a great and exciting product,"" he added.The league will have higher expectations of getting more viewers on the television screens as well with Dinesh Karthik to feature for Paarl Royals in the 2025 season. The now-retired batter will become the first Indian to play in SA20.""It's wonderful to have quality players coming especially from India. They haven't really been allowed to play the leagues around the world. So hopefully it's the start of many Indians coming over. People love watching India play cricket, and seen a lot of the players in the IPL, and to get to see them firsthand... I think the crowds are going to be really excited to see how his type of player comes across and does,"" stated the 49-year-old Kallis.SA20 has produced some exciting talents in the two years. MI Cape Towns' Ryan Rickelton and Dewald Brevis are two of the standout names. Rickelton scored 676 runs in 17 matches for MI Cape Town at an average of 42.25 and strike rate of 155.76. 21-year-old Brevis, meanwhile, has been brought into the international team after scoring 385 runs from 20 matches in the SA20 at a strike rate of 125.40.Another youngster to watch out for is 18-year-old left-arm seamer Kwena Maphaka . He was roped in the Paarl Royals for the second season and has been retained for the third. His talent has been noticed in India as well with Rajasthan Royals recruiting him for Rs 1.50 crore during the IPL 2025 Auction in November.""There is such a wonderful chance for these young guys to come through and show their skills, and if you can be successful in a league like this with such quality opposition and overseas players, it will certainly throw your name forward to playing international cricket,"" said Kallis on the opportunities at hand.Kallis, one of the most influential all-rounders of his time, isn't keen on seeing the Impact Player be introduced in SA20.“No, I don’t like the impact player rule because I think it takes away from the all-rounder. We’re trying to produce all-rounders in South Africa, and this rule diminishes that role. So no, I wouldn’t like to see it in SA20,” he said.","South Africa's T20 league has risen up the charts, with clear ambitions.

IND vs AUS: India batting has been a major cause of worry

How can India still qualify for World Test Championship final?

The 10-day gap between the first and second Test of the ongoing Border Gavaskar Trophy cost India their winning momentum following the impressive 295-run victory in the opener at Perth , feels former India off-spinner Harbhajan Singh ""There was a very long gap between the two Tests, sometimes such a gap spoils the momentum, and that's what happened here,"" said the 44-year-old Harbhajan, who played 103 Tests for India, while talking on Star Sports.The second Test of the series was a pink-ball match played under lights at the Adelaide Oval, and the hosts recovered from the early setback to level the five-match series with a thumping 10-wicket win inside three days.""This series is tough because both the teams have had setbacks. What happened with Australia in Perth, maybe they didn't expect it. And what happened with India in Adelaide, maybe India didn't expect that either,"" Harbhajan added.India also had a change in leadership for the two Tests. While Bumrah captained in Perth when Rohit Sharma was away on a paternity leave, the latter returned to take over the leadership duties in Adelaide.On his return, Rohit decided to not open as both KL Rahul and Yashasvi Jaiswal had the confidence after their 201-run opening stand in the second innings of the Perth Test. However, India's batting failed miserably in Adelaide, folding up for 180 and 175 in their two innings.Out-of-form Rohit endured another poor outing, with scores of 3 and 6 in his two innings.There was just a four-day gap scheduled between the second and third Test, but with the Adelaide Test ending on the third day, the gap extended to six days. However, it's still a shorter turnaround time than the 10 days between the first and second Test, which gives Australia a slight advantage.","India lost the first Test of the Border Gavaskar Trophy by 295 runs in Perth.

Stockholm: Swedish prosecutors on Thursday dropped a rape investigation that was launched in connection with football star Kylian Mbappé's visit to Stockholm in October.In a statement, lead investigator Marina Chirakova said there was not enough evidence to continue the investigation, which centered on an incident at a hotel.“During the course of the investigation, there has been a designated person suspected on reasonable grounds of rape and two cases of sexual assault, but my assessment is that the evidence is not sufficient to proceed and the investigation is therefore closed,"" Chirakova said. “The designated person has not been notified of suspicion of a crime.”Prosecutors never publicly named the suspect in the investigation, but many Swedish media reported it was Real Madrid striker Mbappe , who visited Stockholm in October during a break in the Spanish league.At the time Mbappe's legal team dismissed those reports as false.Mbappe's lawyer Marie-Alix Canu-Bernard and the player's representatives did not immediately respond to a request for comments on Thursday.In an interview that aired Sunday on French TV station, Mbappe said he was ""surprised"" by the reports that he was the subject of a rape investigation and he had not been contacted by Swedish authorities.“These are things that come into your life like that, you can’t see them coming,” Mbappe told. ""It's just incomprehension. I don’t think it weighed on me in the sense that I have never considered myself involved.”The 25-year-old football star appeared in Stockholm on October 10 during an international break instead of playing for France in the Nations League.

Before the season began, advancing to the next stage of the new format seemed inevitable for a side that had won the last four Premier League titles and was the 2023 European champion. However, that is no longer the case as City manager Pep Guardiola struggles with injuries and his players' seeming lack of faith.With goals from Dušan Vlahovic and Weston McKennie causing the most recent loss and igniting Juventus' hopes of qualifying, City has only won one of its last ten games across all competitions.Barcelona 's 3-2 victory over Borussia Dortmund propelled them into second position in the league rankings, behind Liverpool, and ensured their advancement.

Juve won thanks to two American substitutes, including McKennie, who volleyed home from a cross from Timothy Weah.Juventus rose to 14th position.Last season's runner-up Dortmund was forced out of the top eight after Ferran Torres came off the bench to lead Barcelona to their fifth victory in six games.Robert Lewandowski, who had a quiet game against his old team, was replaced by Torres in the 71st minute. Torres scored on the rebound of Dani Olmo's shot just four minutes later.The score was tied at 2-2 after Serhou Guirassy's second goal of the match, but Torres scored again in the 85th minute after Lamine Yamal's counterattack.Barcelona took the lead thanks to Raphinha, and Guirassy equalized from the penalty spot. Lewandowski leads the league with seven goals, while Raphinha and Guirassy are tied for second place with six goals each.Saka scored goals in the 34th and 78th minutes and put in a shot that was converted into the net by substitute Kai Havertz in the 88th, giving Arsenal their third consecutive league-stage home victory without giving up.On goal differential, Arsenal leads Bayer Leverkusen, Aston Villa, Inter Milan, Brest, and Lille. On Wednesday, Lille defeated Sturm Graz 3-2 at home.AC Milan defeated Red Star Belgrade 2-1, with Tammy Abraham scoring the game-winning goal in the 87th minute to pull one point out of the top eight.

The purpose of this meeting is to formally approve Saudi Arabia as the 2034 World Cup host. The meeting will also confirm the six-nation bid, spearheaded by Spain, Portugal, and Morocco, for the 2030 World Cup, involving matches across three continents.“(Wednesday’s) vote is not about who gets the 2030 and 2034 World Cups - that has already been decided.”Norway's federation president, Lise Klaveness, has expressed concerns about the voting process. She argues that FIFA's approval without an itemized vote lacks transparency.“ (Wednesday's) vote ... does not align with the principles of a sound and predictable governance system.”FIFA's approach to the bidding process has been criticized for limited external scrutiny. This comes as FIFA and its president, Gianni Infantino, strengthen financial and political ties with Saudi Arabia.Saudi Arabia's extensive infrastructure plans for the World Cup include stadiums, hotels, and transportation. These projects are expected to rely heavily on migrant labor, raising concerns about potential human rights issues. Similar concerns were raised about worker conditions in Qatar during preparations for the 2022 World Cup.FIFA's internal evaluation of Saudi Arabia's bid identified elevated human rights risks, while also noting potential positive impacts. This assessment has been met with skepticism from human rights activists.A human rights report commissioned by FIFA and conducted by a firm closely associated with Saudi Arabia has also drawn criticism. The report commits World Cup organizers to collaborate solely with state-approved domestic agencies and the International Labour Organization (ILO).The ILO, based in Geneva, previously worked with Qatar on labor reforms. It is currently investigating a formal complaint filed by the Building and Wood Workers' International, a global trade union, alleging labor abuses in Saudi Arabia.The Swiss Football Association has indicated it will support FIFA's decisions regarding the 2030 and 2034 World Cups. However, they have also acknowledged certain ambiguities in Saudi Arabia's strategy for protecting rights and freedoms.“We consider it the duty of FIFA and the organizers, in cooperation with renowned independent international organizations ... to look closely, observe and monitor whether commitments and promises made to workers, teams, fans and media professionals are upheld.”Despite these concerns, the Swiss Football Association expresses confidence that FIFA and World Cup organizers in Saudi Arabia have learned from the experience in Qatar.“ ... it believed FIFA and World Cup organizers in Saudi Arabia 'have learned the lessons from Qatar.'”FIFA has faced criticism for not heeding the advice of a panel of human rights experts. The panel, appointed under pressure from European football officials, including Norway, recommended compensating workers in Qatar and their families.FIFA delayed the publication of the panel's report for nearly a year. The report was eventually released on November 30th, two days after FIFA announced a $50 million legacy fund for the 2022 World Cup. This fund, however, does not provide direct compensation to workers, instead allocating funds to charity projects associated with UN agencies.“The lack of predictability and open processes challenges trust in FIFA as the global custodian of football.”",Norway's football association has declared its intention to abstain from endorsing Saudi Arabia's hosting of the 2034 World Cup. The decision is based on concerns over FIFA's perceived inadequate efforts to safeguard human rights in connection with the tournament.

NEW DELHI: FIFA will officially announce the 2030 and 2034 World Cup hosts on Wednesday.A joint bid from Morocco, Spain, and Portugal is expected to secure the 2030 tournament, while Saudi Arabia is anticipated to host in 2034.The hosting rights will be determined through a vote during a virtual FIFA Congress. However, the outcomes seem predetermined as neither bid faces competition.The 2030 World Cup holds special significance as it marks the centenary of the inaugural tournament held in Uruguay in 1930. To commemorate this milestone, Uruguay will host one match, alongside Argentina and Paraguay.The unique arrangement involves three different continental confederations, creating an unprecedented hosting scenario.FIFA confirmed over a year ago that the Morocco, Spain, and Portugal bid was the sole contender for 2030. Other potential bids had withdrawn.A joint British and Irish bid was abandoned to focus on hosting Euro 2028. There were also unconfirmed suggestions of a joint bid from South Korea, China, Japan, and North Korea.Four South American countries initially launched a joint bid in 2019. They believed the centenary World Cup should be held entirely on the same continent as the first tournament.In late 2022, UEFA promoted a joint bid involving Spain, Portugal, and war-torn Ukraine. This was seen as a gesture of “solidarity” following the Russian invasion.Ukraine was subsequently removed from the candidacy. Morocco joined the Iberian nations, and South America agreed to host three symbolic matches in exchange.Following the “centenary celebrations” in the Southern Hemisphere winter, the participating teams and their fans will travel across the Atlantic for the remaining 101 matches.This extensive tournament will conclude with the final on July 21st. The venue for the final match is yet to be determined.Spain, which hosted the 1982 World Cup, is expected to play a central role, offering 11 of the proposed 20 stadiums.Morocco, having unsuccessfully bid five times previously, will become the second African nation to host the World Cup, following South Africa in 2010.Potential final venues include Madrid’s Santiago Bernabeu, Barcelona’s renovated Camp Nou, and the planned Hassan II stadium. The Hassan II stadium, located between Casablanca and Rabat, is projected to be the ""biggest stadium in the world"" with a capacity of 115,000.Portugal, which hosted Euro 2004, will contribute two stadiums in Lisbon and one in Porto, hoping to host a semi-final.Regarding the 2034 World Cup, FIFA invoked its continental rotation principle, welcoming bids only from Asia or Oceania. The 2026 World Cup, expanded to 48 teams, will be hosted across North America.FIFA gave potential bidders a short timeframe to submit candidacies, causing controversy. Australia and Indonesia quickly withdrew their interest.This left Saudi Arabia as the sole candidate. This paves the way for the World Cup to return to the Gulf region after Qatar hosted in 2022.Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has been utilizing sport to enhance the nation's global image and influence.Securing the 2034 World Cup would be a significant achievement for Saudi Arabia. Currently, they possess only two stadiums with a capacity of 40,000, while 14 are required.Besides the logistical challenges, the extreme summer temperatures might necessitate rescheduling the tournament to later in the year, similar to the 2022 World Cup in Qatar. The timing of Ramadan in December 2034 presents an additional complication.The awarding of the World Cup to Saudi Arabia is expected to reignite discussions surrounding human rights, as seen with Qatar in 2022.Rights groups have raised concerns about mass executions, allegations of torture, restrictions on women under the male guardianship system, and limitations on free expression in Saudi Arabia.Saudi Arabia, currently hosting high-profile events like Formula One and the WTA Finals, faces accusations of ""sportswashing."" This involves using sport to deflect attention from its human rights record.","FIFA will announce the 2030 and 2034 World Cup hosts on Wednesday.

Novak Djokovic will run out of energy: Andre Agassi,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/top-stories/novak-djokovic-will-run-out-of-energy-andre-agassi/articleshow/116235405.cms,"American legend

Andre Agassi

believes Djokovic will miss Federer & Nadal, the guys he came to the dance with

Excerpts:

Djokovic's longevity:

Andy Murray coaching Djokovic:

Carlos Alcaraz

and longevity…

American men haven't had results like the women:

Graf was the hardest victory I ever had: Agassi

BENGALURU: Andre Agassi wondered if the 24-time major winner Novak Djokovic would miss his greatest rivals -- the now-retired Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer -- in the last leg of a glittering career where the 37-year-old goes for more history.The eight-time Grand Slam champion, in the city for the TiE Global Summit, assessed Djokovic's run and the Serb's recent partnership with friend and rival Andy Murray in a candid chat with media.It's hard to say, Father Time always wins. He has already done so much for so long, it's hard to imagine longer. We said that about (Roger) Federer too. I think Novak will run out of energy more than capability. Cannot be easy, especially when the people you came to the dance with have left, that's a big thing.When Pete (Sampras) retired it was a blow to me, it set me back a little bit. It made me rediscover my inspirations on some level. Djokovic has lost the guys he made history with. It'll probably get tougher and tougher emotionally, but I would never bet against them. Bet against them at your peril.In any coach-student relationship you need trust and trust can take time, but it's nice when it starts with believing in somebody because you know that they know your experience. There's an asset to their history as competitors.Any success of a relationship is based on complete buy-in and that's always the part you have to wait and see. It's not what I know that changes your career, information doesn't lead to transformation, somebody has to counter that. That's the connector. I'm sure there's going to be a lot of trust immediately, we'll see how the results go.Alcaraz defends like Novak, has more power and spin like Nadal, hands and finesse like Federer but just because he has the best of all the three doesn't mean he can do what they did. There are so many parts to the game such as decision-making, injuries, luck. So how long can (Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner) do it (for)? They could do it for 20 years or not.The women's game hasn't had to deal with Roger Federer, Novak Djokovic, Rafael, Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz, but they have their version of it. Serena Williams is the Novak of the women's game and you got Coco as a potential, like Alcaraz has potential and Sinner has potential.How the game evolves is interesting. The women's game has gotten very powerful, just straight power. For lack of a better example, Lindsay Davenport was powerful, tall, precise through the court and now you have a lot of that. There's still room for somebody who can offset that kind of power, like an Ash Barty.The men's game has changed in the sense that guys have gotten bigger with longer levers, which means they're better athletes, they can move and they need more time, they start playing further back. Soon you're going to start seeing the net game start coming back, everything morphs in its own way. But the biggest issue for American (men) not winning is an unfortunate set of decades where the guys were very stingy and very greedy -- 66 Grand Slams in the same generation. There's not a lot left there (for others)!Andre Agassi - the second of five men to achieve a career Grand Slam in the Open Era and the first man to complete a career golden slam - has won it all, including a stirring love match.""She was the hardest victory I ever had,"" said Agassi of his wife German tennis legend Steffi Graf, a 22-time major winner.Agassi, who has won eight major titles and the Olympic gold, speaking during a session at the TiE Global Summit, said, ""We all live a hero's journey - first part of life is about performing and achieving. Then life hits us with broken relationships and dreams. I went through it all. Finally, in the last phase of the journey, it's about serving others.""The 54-year-old said, ""At 28 my (tennis) career started over. Without the struggles, I would've never gotten Steffi to say yes. I tried to get her for years.""On a lighter note, Agassi said he likes to keep his trophies out of the house. ""I don't bring my trophies home, because if I bring my trophies home, then she brings her trophies home - and that's bad math!""",Andre Agassi believes Novak Djokovic will run out of energy more than capability. The eight-time Grand Slam champion is in the city for the TiE Global Summit. Agassi is the second of five men to achieve a career Grand Slam in the Open Era.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116235384,imgsize-29004,width-400,resizemode-4/116235384.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Legendary player Andre Agassi observed that Carlos Alcaraz embodies distinct qualities from Novak Djokovic Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal , while advising the tennis world against anticipating the young Spaniard to match the extraordinary achievements of these tennis legends.The collective Grand Slam victories of Federer, Nadal and Djokovic stand at 66, whilst Alcaraz, aged 21, has secured four major titles thus far.""I'm not a genius and I don't have a crystal ball. What I can tell you is Alcaraz defends like Novak, has power and spin like Nadal and has hands and finesse like Federer,"" said Agassi during a talk session in Bengaluru.The eight-time Grand Slam victor Agassi elaborated on why excessive expectations shouldn't burden Alcaraz.""Just because he has the best of all those three doesn't mean he can do what they did because there're so many other parts to the game, which mean decision-making, injuries, you know, luck,"" he said.With Djokovic at 37, approaching retirement, Agassi noted that the Serbian's competitive edge might diminish without Nadal and Federer in the arena.""He's already done so much, so long, and it's hard to imagine longer. I think he'll run out of the energy for it more than the capability of it, I would imagine.""It cannot be easy, especially when the people you came to the dance with have left.""The American provided additional context to his assessment.""When Pete (Sampras) retired, it was a blow to me. It set me back a little bit. It made me have to rediscover my inspirations on some level.""And he's (Djokovic) lost the guys that he's made history with. So, it's probably emotionally going to get tougher and tougher quickly, but I would never bet against him. Bet against him at your own peril,"" said Agassi.Regarding Djokovic's recent appointment of Andy Murray as coach to extend his career, Agassi expressed interest in their partnership's development.""They've been fierce rivals on court, and now Murray will be coaching Djokovic. Well, in any coaching student relationship, you need trust. Trust can take time.""I think there's an asset to their history as competitors, but any success of a relationship is based on complete buy-in.""",Andre Agassi says Carlos Alcaraz embodies distinct qualities from Novak Djokovic Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal.

NEW DELHI: Tennis icon Andre Agassi on Tuesday highlighted how sports should remain integral to education, noting their role in teaching children to cope with defeat.At a Bengaluru event focussed on sports and education's role in fostering excellence, Agassi shared his insights.""Even when you have a failure, you have to get up and play again the next day. So, what sports is teaching you is that focusing on winning and losing is really a distraction from what we need to be thinking about. We need to be thinking about how to get better,"" he said.Since 2001, Agassi has invested in education for underprivileged children, establishing 130 schools serving approximately 80,000 students in the United States. He attributes this achievement to his persistent drive to overcome obstacles.His demanding tennis career shaped his ability to maintain focus and adapt when necessary.""Sports is all about problem-solving. Tennis taught me how to navigate a very intense environment and maintain my objectivity and problem-solving abilities. It forces me to be present, but also to understand the context of what I'm doing,"" Agassi said.Regarding his earlier defiant period, Agassi acknowledged it as a necessary phase in his journey.""Vulnerability is essential for growth, and I think vulnerability eventually leads to humility,"" he added.He recognised technology's crucial role in education, particularly in providing individualised learning opportunities for children. This belief influenced his investment in the Indian EdTech company, Square Panda .""I think technology can play an essential role, not just in scalability, but also in optimising personalised learning. That's why I got involved with Square Panda. We are here because of the sheer scale of impact the technology will bring to education,"" he said.","Tennis icon Andre Agassi highlighted how sports should remain integral to education.

NEW DELHI: Former world number one tennis player from Romania Simona Halep has raised concerns about the perceived discrepancies in the treatment of cases involving positive tests for banned substances by the International Tennis Integrity Agency ( ITIA ).Her criticism stems from the recent one-month ban imposed on Iga Swiatek , the current world number two, after testing positive for the heart medication trimetazidine (TMZ) in an out-of-competition sample.Halep, who returned to tennis in March 2023 after serving a provisional suspension since October 2022 for testing positive for roxadustat at the US Open, believes there is a lack of consistency in the ITIA's approach.She questions the significant difference in the penalties handed out to her and Swiatek, despite the cases occurring around the same time.In her statement, Halep expressed her bewilderment at the disparate treatment and questioned the logical reasoning behind the ITIA's decisions.

P.V. Sindhu, a two-time Olympic medalist, confirmed her plans to continue playing badminton for the next few years, with the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics in mind. Her recent victory at the Syed Modi International badminton tournament ended a title drought and brought her relief.Sindhu hopes this win marks a new phase of success in her career. The 29-year-old former world champion acknowledges that staying injury-free is crucial as she moves forward.“This (win) will definitely give me a lot of confidence. Being 29 is an advantage in many ways because I have a lot of experience. Being smart and experienced is key, and I'm definitely going to play for the next couple of years.”Sindhu recognizes the benefits of experience at her age. She emphasizes the importance of strategic play and plans to continue competing. Her primary focus remains on injury prevention.“My main goal is to stay injury-free, which is very, very important. Los Angeles (Olympics) is still too far away. I will definitely play, but the main thing is staying injury-free and enjoying the sport. If I stay fit, then why not?”While the Los Angeles Olympics are a long-term goal, Sindhu intends to participate if she remains fit. She defeated China's Wu Luo Yu in the Syed Modi International final, securing her third title in this tournament. Her previous wins were in 2017 and 2022.“I'm very happy that I'm finishing off with a win. Now it's time to just go back, relax, and start again from January. I hope this is a comeback, and I'm looking forward to many more victories.”Sindhu expresses her happiness at ending the year with a victory. She plans to rest and prepare for upcoming tournaments in Malaysia, India, Indonesia, and Thailand.“I'll be playing the upcoming tournaments in Malaysia, India, Indonesia, and Thailand. Obviously, we'll have to pick and choose tournaments because I'll have to be smart enough to decide what to play and what not. I need to be much smarter in terms of that.”Sindhu will carefully select tournaments to manage her schedule and fitness. Her previous title was at the Singapore Open in July 2022. She was also a finalist at the Malaysia Masters Super 500 earlier this year. However, she experienced a pre-quarterfinal exit at the Paris Olympics.“Sometimes I was really close yet so far away. I had good matches in the past, but they didn't turn into wins. I came back, fought harder, and it was important for me to get this win. Yes, I am relieved. I mean, it's the end of the year, and finishing off with a win makes me really grateful.”Sindhu reflects on past near misses and expresses gratitude for her recent win. Lakshya Sen , the 2021 World Championships bronze medalist, won the men's singles final against Singapore's Jia Heng Jason Teh.“I am really happy with the way I had prepared and how I played the match. I hope to do well in the tournaments next year. I have some time now till the new season, which will allow me to train and focus on the upcoming events.”Sen expresses satisfaction with his preparation and performance. He looks forward to the next season and plans to utilize the time for training. The Indian women's doubles pair of Treesa Jolly and Gayatri Gopichand won their first Super 300 title. They defeated China's Bao Li Jing and Li Qian.“We really wanted to win, we were aggressive and kept moving well. There was a strategy, and we implemented it well today. We plan to go with the flow and see what the future holds. We don't want to make too many plans.”Gayatri and Treesa highlight their aggressive strategy and successful implementation. They prefer to remain adaptable for future tournaments. This victory boosts their confidence ahead of the BWF World Tour Finals in China, where they are the sole Indian representatives.“This is our first gold, and it's a great boost for both of us. It has given us a lot of confidence, and we are looking forward to the World Tour Finals now.”The pair view their win as a significant confidence booster for the upcoming World Tour Finals. They are the first Indian women's doubles team to win the Syed Modi International title. They were runners-up in 2022.“The first game was close, but we listened to our coaches, corrected ourselves, and executed the plans. At this level, there is always pressure, and we managed it well.”Treesa and Gayatri credit their coaches for helping them adjust their strategy during the match. They acknowledge the pressure at this level of competition and their ability to handle it effectively.","P.V. Sindhu confirmed her plans to continue playing badminton for the next few years.

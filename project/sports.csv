Sam Konstas on Kohli altercation: 'I was doing my gloves, he accidentally bumped me'

NEW DELHI: Former Australia captain Ricky Ponting has expressed disappointment over the 20 percent match fee fine imposed on Indian batting star Virat Kohli for his altercation with debutant Sam Konstas , arguing that the punishment handed down by the ICC ""is not harsh enough.""Konstas’ debut was a memorable affair, as the 19-year-old not only impressed with a fearless 60-run knock, including 34 runs off Indian pace ace Jasprit Bumrah, but also found himself at the center of controversy involving Kohli.During a tense moment, Kohli shoulder-bumped Konstas in a direct physical contact, for which the ICC fined him 20 percent of his match fee and added one demerit point to his disciplinary record.Speaking on 7 Cricket ahead of day two of the match, Ponting said: ""Personally, I do not think it [the punishment] was harsh enough. I know there are precedents [where similar infringements have incurred similar-sized penalties] - they have generally been between a 15 and 25 per cent fine but let us have a think about the enormity of yesterday.""Ponting also emphasised the broader implications of such incidents.""It is probably the most-watched day of cricket all year all around the world. Imagine if that happens in a grade game on the weekend now, what is going to happen there? I think people are going to think that that is almost acceptable now.""He further highlighted the responsibilities of senior players like Kohli and said: ""And unfortunately for someone like Virat, as we got told as players and as senior players, sometimes it is [the scale of punishment] just different for some people. He is a role model, he is somebody the cricketing world looks up to, so I personally do not think that the fine was harsh enough.""","Former Australia captain Ricky Ponting has expressed disappointment over the 20 percent match fee fine imposed on Indian batting star Virat Kohli.

Sam Konstas on Kohli altercation: 'I was doing my gloves, he accidentally bumped me'

NEW DELHI: Australia's star batter Steve Smith created history on Friday, becoming the most successful century-maker against India in Test cricket . Smith achieved the milestone with his 11th century against India during the second day of the fourth Test of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy at the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG).Smith surpassed England's Joe Root, who has 10 centuries against India, for the record. Smith's 11 tons have come in just 43 innings, while Root required 55 innings to reach his tally.The Australian batter scored a magnificent 140 off 197 balls, an innings studded with three sixes and 13 fours, propelling the hosts beyond the 450-run mark. It marked Smith's second century of the series, following a gritty 101 in the third Test in Brisbane, which was his first ton in 25 innings since June 2023.Smith's overall Test record now boasts 34 centuries, the second-highest for an Australian behind Ricky Ponting 's 41. He has joined an elite group of players, including Sunil Gavaskar , Brian Lara, Younis Khan , and Mahela Jayawardene, all of whom also have 34 Test centuries. Smith is now tied for seventh place on the all-time list of century-makers, which is led by India's Sachin Tendulkar with 51 hundreds.Smith reached his milestone at the MCG with a boundary offNitish Reddy during the morning session. He was eventually dismissed by Akash Deep for 140, falling to an inside edge that dragged onto his stumps.In his 113-Test career, Smith has amassed 9,949 runs at an exceptional average of 56.85, complemented by 34 centuries and 41 half-centuries. As he edges closer to the 10,000-run mark, Smith continues to solidify his status as one of the greatest Test cricketers of his generation.","Steve Smith becomes most successful century-maker against India in Test cricket.

Kohli-Konstas episode

NEW DELHI: When 19-year-old Sam Konstas took strike against Jasprit Bumrah on the opening day of the fourth Test at the Melbourne Cricket Ground , the debutant was caught on camera muttering words to himself as the bowler steamed in. This habit persisted against every bowler, be it Bumrah or Mohammed Siraj, drawing curiosity from fans and commentators alike.In a video posted by Channel 7, Konstas explained his unique self-talk during an interview at the end of the day’s play.Australia’s decision to field Konstas for the final two matches of the Border-Gavaskar series proved to be a tactical masterstroke. The fearless teenager overcame a few early jitters to play a scintillating knock of 60 off 65 balls on debut.Konstas didn’t shy away from taking on India’s star bowler, Jasprit Bumrah, unleashing a mix of innovative scoops, daring pulls, and unpolished slogs. His counterattacking approach rattled the Indian bowling attack, setting the stage for Australia’s strong start.Although his innings ended when Ravindra Jadeja trapped him lbw after the second drinks break, Konstas walked off to a standing ovation. His 52-ball half-century became the third fastest by an Australian debutant.The opening session wasn’t without controversy. During a break in play, Virat Kohli shoulder-bumped Konstas as the youngster walked to confer with Usman Khawaja. The incident, which drew boos from the Melbourne crowd, forced umpire Michael Gough to step in and mediate.Former Australian captain Ricky Ponting , commentating for Seven Network, called Kohli the instigator. The International Cricket Council has yet to confirm whether disciplinary action will follow, but physical contact during a match can carry severe penalties.Konstas’ eventful debut, highlighted by his explosive batting and the on-field clash with Kohli, left an indelible mark on day one. His performance not only bolstered Australia’s innings but also established him as a fearless competitor on the international stage.",Sam Konstas was caught on camera muttering to himself as he took strike against Jasprit Bumrah on the opening day of the fourth Test at the Melbourne Cricket Ground.

Sam Konstas on Kohli altercation: 'I was doing my gloves, he accidentally bumped me'

'INDIA RATTLED'

'KOHLI WILL REGRET IT'

NEW DELHI: The dramatic scenes on Boxing Day at the Melbourne Cricket Ground were like watching a Bollywood thriller bringing viewers to the edge of their seats in anticipation of another electrifying moment. Sam Konstas 's fiery debut put Bumrah through the unfamiliar -- being hit for six with the red ball, before the show-stealing 'action sequence' involving Virat Kohli and the Australian teenager.The 19-year old opening batter Konstas, brought into the side by Australia on the back of his century against the visitors in a warm-up game and following the failure of Nathan McSweeney, got under the skin of the Indian team with an attacking knock.It rattled India and led to unwarranted scenes of Kohli shoulder-barging Konstas, which match referee Andy Pycroft viewed as a breach of the ICC Code of Conduct for ""inappropriate physical contact"". As a result, Kohli was fined and handed one demerit point for a Level 1 offence.Analysing the incident, former England spinner Monty Panesar feels that suspending Kohli for a first such offence would have been harsh, but if the Indian legend misbehaves again, he should be suspended.""The fact is that this youngster rattled India,"" said Panesar talking to Timesofindia.com from London. ""It's as simple as that. He threw punches at them, played a few shots, and they didn't like it.""""He played his reverse scoop shots and hit Jasprit Bumrah for a six over third-man, which, I think, hurt India's ego. Then Kohli doing that, he obviously instigated it.""Kohli is known to not take a backward step when it comes to expressing himself on the field and giving it back to the opposition. But Monty feels the batting icon took it a little bit too far on Thursday against a player who is 17 years younger to him.""He's a 19-year-old kid! It was unnecessary for him (Kohli) to do it. A lot of people obviously know the answer to that, but then I suppose that's the nature he plays his cricket. He is aggressive, he's intense. If he doesn't like how the other team approaches, when they throw a punch back, that's his way to react,"" said Panesar, who played 50 Tests for England and took 167 wickets.""But he (Konstas) didn't care less. He thought 'I am going to keep going with it'...If you go after the top bowlers, they don't like it, and it was good to see the youngster choosing to stand up against a player of the stature of Virat Kohli.""Konstas scored 60 off 65 balls before being dismissed lbw by Ravindra Jadeja. He added 89 runs with Usman Khawaja (57), which is Australia's best opening stand of this Border Gavaskar Trophy. The five-Test series currently stands at 1-1.Monty feels Kohli will regret his actions looking back at the day's play, but if he repeats such unwarranted behaviour again, he should be handed a suspension.""He'll probably regret it now, looking back at it when he's a little bit cooler, looking back and thinking 'well, he's a guy who is 19 and I am one of the biggest superstars in cricket, and I am shoulder-barging him. Why did I have to do that?'"" Monty said.""I suppose for him to be suspended for behaviour like that is probably a little bit harsh. He obviously deliberately shoulder-barged Konstas, and he didn't need to do it,"" the 42-year-old former left-arm spinner said. ""If he does it again, and he misbehaves in the second innings, they (India) go after him (Konstas), then yeah, obviously give him a suspension because first time is a warning, second time suspension.""...You won't see Cristiano Ronaldo do anything like that; you won't see some of the other big superstars, when there's a youngster making his debut, do that. But good on him (Konstas), good to stand up because they were trying to intimidate him, trying to bully him by Virat Kohli barging him (so that) he goes into his shell or gets out. But he didn't. He took them on. Hit them out of the ground, hit them everywhere. That's what you want to do,"" Monty added.Panesar, who had Sachin Tendulkar as his first Test wicket, concluded by saying that Konstas took the right approach in his first international knock by fighting fire with fire, which is the way to tackle the ""aggressive"" Indian team.""You've got to respond like that to this Indian team because they are very intense, very aggressive; and if they come hard at you, you've got to come back harder as well. You can't sit down, and it's good to see that the 19-year-old stood up,"" said the Indian-origin player, who has roots in Punjab.India ended the first day of the Melbourne Test on a better note after Australia's top four scored a half-century each following the home team's decision to bat first.From 240 for 3, Australia stuttered their way to 311 for 6 at close of play, with Steven Smith batting on 68 and skipper Pat Cummins on 8.Bumrah was once again the pick of the Indian bowlers with his figures of 3 for 75.

ROHIT'S POOR RUN

INDIA, ROHIT RATTLED

NEW DELHI: Rohit Sharma is undoubtedly going through a tough twilight period of his cricket career both as a captain as well as a batter. He will look to resurrect it by possibly returning to his customary position as an opener in the ongoing Melbourne Test in hope of runs that help him regain confidence and poise as a leader.With India's No. 3 Shubman Gill dropped from the eleven for an extra spin-bowling all-rounder in the form of Washington Sundar, KL Rahul will in all probability play the role of one-down batter, allowing Rohit to open again in Melbourne, and in the last Test at Sydney. Those four possible innings, believes former England spinner Monty Panesar , will be make-or-break knocks for the Indian captain's Test career.""I think that (to open batting again) is the only option for Rohit,"" said Panesar, talking to Timesofindia.com from London. ""To be honest, he's got four innings to save his Test career. If he doesn't perform that well, I think he will probably retire as well.""If that happens, it will be the second high-profile retirement of the series, with off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin hanging his boots after the third Test in Brisbane, quitting international cricket with immediate effect.If India fail to qualify for the World Test Championship final, their next Test assignment will be the five-Test tour of England in June-July 2025. For Rohit to play that, if he wants to, Panesar believes he will have to fire in Melbourne and Sydney.""...With the five Test matches in England, I think Rohit should probably take the ownership and say 'right, you know, (in) overseas Test matches I have got to perform like I do...be aggressive, take it on',"" said Panesar.""If he does that, I think he will probably carry on as captain. But if he fails, I think he will be the first one to stand up and say, 'guys, I think I am done, and you have got to move on with the new team'. Especially with five Test matches in England, you have got to build a new side.""The five-Test Border Gavaskar Trophy stands at 1-1 after three Tests, which means a win in Melbourne will ensure that India won't lose the series and thus remain the title-holders. But Australia have done well to reach 311 for 6 at stumps on day one.If India can take the last four wickets quickly to wrap up the Australian first innings for under 350 and then the visitors' top order bats well, it will be game on.""It's a big, big innings for him (Rohit) in Melbourne...I think especially that first innings is a big one for him. He's got to show good intent and start well because Australia are going to come out not holding back now,"" said the 42-year-old former left-arm spinner, who played 50 Tests for England.After a dramatic first day, where Virat Kohli shoulder-barging 19-year-old debutant opener Sam Konstas grabbed the headlines, Panesar believes Indian batters will have to deal with a hostile Australian team now.Kohli has been fined by the match referee for ""inappropriate physical contact"" and also handed one demerit point for the Level 1 offence in the ICC Code of Conduct.""They (Australian bowlers) are going to come out at Virat, going to make him very uncomfortable, probably the top six as well, (saying) 'how do you just shoulder-barge a 19-year-old like that?'... I think it's going to be hostile when they come out to bat,"" said Panesar, who is of Indian origin, with his family's roots in Punjab.He added that it will make Rohit's challenge a stiff one against the charged-up Aussie pacers Mitchell Starc, Pat Cummins and Scott Boland.""You have got to be ready for it, and ready for counter-punching and playing aggressive cricket, which I am sure Rohit Sharma can do. But if it was in India, he would have been more confident. He is just not sure if he has the same impact in away Test matches,"" Panesar reckoned.Rohit, who missed the first Test in Perth while on paternity leave after the birth of his child, has been going through a rough phase in red-ball cricket. His bat has been silent for three consecutive series now, starting with two Tests against Bangladesh and three against New Zealand at home.He aggregated 42 runs in four innings against Bangladesh and 91 in six innings against the Kiwis. It had an impact on his captaincy as well, with India suffering an embarrassing 0-3 whitewash against New Zealand. Batting at No. 6 in three innings of this BGT so far, Rohit's knocks read 3, 6 and 10.Getting runs under his belt, thus, is imperative for the Indian skipper, according to Panesar.""If he (Rohit) comes round the corner and does well, scores a hundred, I think he answers all his critics; and I am sure he will carry on. But if it doesn't go too well for him...if he knows he is past his best, he will just say 'guys, last Test match in Sydney I am retiring, and that will be it.""Rohit, too, was part of a confrontational incident on the first day of play in Melbourne where he was seen having a word with Marnus Labuschagne, after he saw the Australian batter repeatedly running down the middle of the track.Panesar believes such incidents were largely because India got rattled by the aggressive approach debutant Konstas took in scoring 60 off 65, especially when he played audacious ramp shots against the best bowler of the series, Bumrah.""I think India have been rattled, let's be honest. They thought Konstas probably would have got out and it would have been a much better day for them, and (they) would have bowled Australia out for 300,"" said Panesar.""If they were on top, they would have probably not bothered (about things like Labuschagne running on the pitch). I think it's just more the fact...that a young 19-year-old, who has played 11 Sheffield Shield games, is reverse-sweeping (ramp shot) Bumrah over third-man for six. That is showing complete disrespect to Bumrah and this Indian team.""Panesar believes that it was the audacity of a teenager more than anything else that put India off, which also rattled batting legend Kohli to the point that he shoulder-barged a teenage debutant 17 years younger to him.""Virat is left thinking 'he doesn't feel intimidated by me.' This 19-year-old doesn't feel intimidated by this Indian team. That is what's hurting the ego of this Indian team right now,"" he added.""The real hurt is that a 19-year-old whacks Bumrah over third-man for six. That was pinching them.""",Rohit Sharma could open for India in Melbourne Test against Australia. Former England spinner Monty Panesar says Sharma has four innings to save his Test career.

NEW DELHI: South Africa ended day one at 82 for three wickets in response to Pakistan 's first innings total of 211 in the first Test at Centurion on Thursday.Pakistan's bowlers made crucial breakthroughs, with Khurram Shahzad and Mohammad Abbas dismantling the hosts' top order.South Africa now trail by 129 runs, with Khurram removing Tony de Zorzi (2) and Ryan Rickelton (8), whilst Abbas, returning to Test cricket after three years, dismissed Tristan Stubbs (9) lbw.Aiden Markram remains unbeaten on 47, batting alongside captain Temba Bavuma (4 not out), as they look to continue on Friday.On a bowler-friendly surface, both sides opted for all-pace attacks.

The plethora of T20 stars that the International League T20 ( ILT20 ) attracts ensures cricket is of a high standard. With the league offering the biggest payday outside of the Indian Premier League (IPL), it is an attractive proposition for players over the world.Here, we take a look back at the inaugural edition in 2023, with three players in particular focus because their performances might have not got the credit they deserve.Their bare numbers look good. But when seen in context, they are even better.Sri Lankan spinner Wanindu Hasaranga played nine games in the ILT20 2023 for Desert Vipers . He batted only five times, and took 15 wickets in his team’s run to the final, bowling his full quota of overs in most games. While batting, he scored 115 runs at a good strike rate of 145.57. His economy rate while bowling was 7.2, which potrays fairly handy figures, but perhaps not immediately eye-grabbing.Once you dive deeper though, Hasaranga’s value becomes apparent. For instance, of the 15 wickets he took, 14 were of batters in the top seven. The only one outside the top seven was when he snared Sunil Narine who was at No.8 – hardly a cheap wicket. Hasaranga’s strikes gave the Vipers decisive control when they were bowling, because he stopped good batters in their tracks. The difference between getting batters before they tee off versus getting them in the death overs is large.Hasaranga’s batting wasn’t as impactful throughout the tournament, but he saved his best for the final, smashing 55 from 27 balls to lift a floundering score to 146 for 8. The Vipers eventually didn’t have enough to stop Gulf Giants from winning, but Hasaranga took 1 for 28 in his full quota of overs too, making the Giants really sweat for their win. Hasaranga’s team may have lost, but there was no player who came close to matching him for all-round impact, and he was the clear Man of the Tournament.Among batters, Kieron Pollard was third on the run charts with 394 runs, but those came at a blistering strike rate of 192.2. Alex Hales (469) and James Vince (439) got more runs than Pollard, but they opened the batting and had more time to build bigger innings while Pollard batted almost exclusively at No.5. Plus, they did it at much lower speeds.Pollard batted nine times, and thestrike rate he had was 134.8. In seven of the nine innings, he was striking at over 160. He wasn’t dismissed in single digits at all. That was the kind of scorching form he was in. He truly led MI Emirates from the front and was perhaps the most important reason they qualified for the playoffs, eventually finishing third.Even in the second qualifier that they lost to eventual champions Gulf Giants, Pollard smashed 57 not out from 35 balls, lifting a struggling innings to a competitive score of 167 for 5.The bowler who made an impact that might not register immediately was Adam Zampa . This was largely due to the fact that Zampa played only four games for Dubai Capitals .But in those four games, he bagged nine wickets and his economy rate was an astounding 4.75. He bowled his entire quota of four overs in each game, and although the Capitals lost two of those games and won two, Zampa did everything expected of a star recruit and more.Every single one of his wickets was of a batter in the top six, and the most runs he conceded was 24. He went at less than a run-a-ball in each of his other outings. The fact that he was not available when the Capitals faced off against MI Emirates in the Eliminator doubtless played a part in their eventual defeat.","The International League T20 ( ILT20 ) attracts a plethora of T20 stars.

Former Australian batter and coach Justin Langer discussed a conversation with KL Rahul regarding Sam Konstas 's aggressive batting against India on the first day of the Boxing Day Test .Konstas replaced Nathan McSweeney in the Australian squad for the fourth Test due to McSweeney's poor run of form.Australian selectors chose Konstas to debut at the MCG against India's bowling attack.Konstas's selection followed a strong performance in the unofficial Test against India A, where he displayed a range of unconventional shots.Langer recounted his pre-match conversation with Rahul about Konstas. Rahul had doubted Konstas's ability to replicate his aggressive style in the Test match.""He's only played 11 first-class games, but I did speak to KL Rahul before the game. I asked him, 'Have you seen this kid, Sam Konstas?' And he said, 'Oh, we only saw him in the Prime Minister's XI game (50 overs). He was playing these ramp shots and all this sort of stuff.' Rahul said, 'But he won't do that today.' I said, 'Yeah, sure, he won't do that today.' And straight away, Sam Konstas was doing that,"" Langer said on Star Sports.Konstas quickly proved Rahul wrong, hitting a ramp shot off Jasprit Bumrah for four. His confident and aggressive batting propelled Australia to a strong position.Konstas's innings of 60 off 65 balls helped Australia reach 311/6 at the end of the day's play, impressing spectators and former cricketers alike.""He's been given a licence to go and attack Bumrah, but that's not easy--that is so hard to do. Even in T20 cricket, I think Bumrah's economy rate is as good as anyone's. So it's not easy to do that. But the kid was bold, talking a good game, and then he came and put it into action. That's what great players do. Anyone can talk a good game. He came and put it into action, and it was exciting to watch,"" he added.","Former Australian batter and coach Justin Langer discussed a conversation with KL Rahul regarding Sam Konstas's aggressive batting against India on the first day of the Boxing Day Test.

Tottenham Hotspur manager, Ange Postecoglou , anticipates squad reinforcements during the upcoming January transfer window. The team has recently faced challenges with injuries and suspensions, impacting their performance in the Premier League Despite these setbacks, Postecoglou remains committed to his attacking style of play. This approach has contributed to both thrilling victories and disappointing losses in recent matches.Last week's League Cup quarter-final win against Manchester United , ending 4-3, highlighted the team's attacking prowess. However, this was followed by a heavy 6-3 defeat against Liverpool in the league.Postecoglou confirmed his intention to strengthen the squad in January, ahead of the Boxing Day fixture against Nottingham Forest.""Like I said a while ago, we've been planning,"" he told a pre-match press conference.""A lot of it was going to be around where we're at around this time. Fair to say we're still a little bit short in a couple of areas and we need to reinforce.""Tottenham's continued involvement in multiple competitions necessitates squad depth. Postecoglou pointed out the demands of the Carabao Cup, European competition, and the FA Cup.""I think the fact that, obviously, we're still in the Carabao (League) Cup semi-final, still got Europe, FA Cup, we're in all the competitions, it's not like our schedule's going to ease up at any stage.""""So, I think it makes sense.

He acknowledged the effort required to implement his demanding playing style.""I can't be critical of this group of players at the moment in any sense,"" he said.""I think it would be unfair for anyone to because what they're doing is they're giving absolute maximum effort.""That's backed up by the physical parameters you put against what they're doing.

The four-time consecutive Premier League winners have lost nine of their last 12 games leading into the Boxing Day match against Everton.""They (City) have enjoyed so much success under Pep (Guardiola) over the years that everybody seems to be under this impression that it's when, not if, it turns back,"" said Dyche.Dyche acknowledges City's dominance under Pep Guardiola and the expectation of their eventual return to form.

The Everton manager views City's current struggles as a testament to the Premier League's competitiveness.""You'd think at some point it happens, even to the best, and he is arguably one of the best ever, but for him to have a testing period actually shows how tough the game is even for the top sides.""Dyche points out that even the best teams are susceptible to difficulties if they don't maintain attention to detail. He emphasizes that Everton are also working on improving their performance.""The details, even for the top teams, if you don't get them right, then things don't work out for you. They'll be trying to correct that.""Everton, while improving, still aims to increase their win count and goal tally. Dyche stresses the importance of a strong performance against City.

Manchester City 's poor performance, with just one victory in eight Premier League matches, is a collective team issue rather than an individual's fault, according to manager Pep Guardiola 's statement on Tuesday. He emphasised that striker Erling Haaland should not be singled out for criticism.The champions' current position at seventh place, trailing Liverpool by 12 points, has coincided with Haaland's reduced scoring rate. After netting 10 goals in the initial five matches, the Norwegian has only scored twice during this difficult period.""It's about us, it's not just about one player,"" Guardiola told a press conference ahead of Thursday's game with Everton .""So when in the past we scored goals and Erling was so prolific in helping us, it's because of the team. And when you have problems at the back, in the middle, it's for everyone.""If it was just one player, the reason why, it would be easy. It's not about that. Erling is so important for us, will be so important for us, has been, and we try to do the things better, to use him better.""The availability of John Stones , Matheus Nunes and Ederson remains uncertain for the Everton fixture. Despite being unable to identify a specific cause for their recent struggles, Guardiola expressed confidence about an improvement in results soon.Regarding their current difficulties, Guardiola addressed various aspects affecting the team's performance, acknowledging that multiple factors have contributed to their decline in form. He emphasised the importance of upcoming matches as opportunities for improvement.Everton, despite being 15th in the table and 11 points behind City, has demonstrated strong defensive capabilities with five clean sheets in their previous six matches.Guardiola praised Sean Dyche 's tactical approach, particularly highlighting Everton's defensive organisation and effectiveness in transitions.With the Boxing Day fixture approaching, City's players will have limited family time during Christmas. The team's schedule includes training sessions and an overnight stay before the match on December 26.","Manchester City have won just one of their last eight Premier League matches.

Roger Federer announced his retirement in 2022.Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner decided to skip preparatory tournaments before the year's first major championship, the Australian Open, which starts on January 12.Based on the standards Djokovic sets, 2024 proved difficult, with no Grand Slam victories and only securing the Olympic gold in Paris, before concluding his season in October.The Brisbane tournament features strong competitors including an in-form Grigor Dimitrov, Holger Rune and Frances Tiafoe. Australian Nick Kyrgios joins the lineup after a lengthy absence, having played just one ATP Tour singles match in two years due to injuries.Djokovic will also be seen in men's doubles, partnering Kyrgios.On the women's side of the competition, there are American stars Jessica Pegula and Emma Navarro, ranked seventh and eighth respectively. The field also features former world number two Ons Jabeur and the experienced Victoria Azarenka.World No. 1 Sabalenka, who defeated China's rising star Zheng Qinwen in this year's Melbourne final, experienced an outstanding 2024, culminating in her recognition as WTA Player of the Year this month.The accomplished tennis player, aged 26, demonstrated remarkable success by reaching seven finals and securing four championships, including a successful defence of her Australian Open title, clinching her maiden US Open victory, and winning WTA 1000 tournaments in Cincinnati and Wuhan.She managed to regain the top world ranking from Swiatek, the five-time Grand Slam winner, whose standing faced scrutiny in November when reports emerged about her positive test for prohibited cardiac medication in August.The International Tennis Integrity Agency determined that the breach was unintentional, resulting in a minimal one-month penalty for the Polish athlete.The situation mirrors that of Australian Open champion Sinner, who awaits the World Anti-Doping Agency's verdict regarding his earlier clearance after two positive tests for clostebol traces in March.","Novak Djokovic needs one more Grand Slam trophy for an unprecedented 25th crown, surpassing Margaret Court's 24.

(AP)

Excerpts:

Why did you and Ebden decide not to pursue the partnership in 2025?

What was your thinking behind partnering Nicolás Barrientos?

You partnered Sriram Balaji for the Olympics, was he an option?

You’ve announced you’re playing with Barrientos for just two tournaments, Adelaide and then the Australian Open…

Is 2025 your farewell season?

What did your success in that 12-month stretch from mid-2023 to the summer of 2024 tell you about yourself?

How does the future of Indian tennis look at this stage?

IN NUMBERS

At the start of the year Rohan Bopanna gave himself the best pre-44th birthday gift when he claimed the World No.1 ranking and clinched his first men’s doubles Grand Slam title in a spectacular 2024 Australian Open fortnight, where he became the poster boy for longevity.The Indian rode that wave with Matthew Ebden into the summer after which their season lost some shine, bringing to an end a strong partnership. Bopanna, ranked 15, starts the 2025 season down under in starkly different circumstances – pairing with the 37-year-old Colombian Nicolás Barrientos – but is no less determined to keep going.To me and my coach Scott (Davidoff) it came as a surprise, I don't think either of us expected it. I mean he had some reasons, he wanted to change.Initially, during the US Open, he said he was going to play with Austin Krajicek, but I think that fell apart and then he came back saying he wants to play with me. Then during the Paris Masters the Belgians — Joran Vliegen and Sanders Gille — split, when he decided he wanted to play with Vliegen. I don't know what the real reason behind that was.He was the one available, Ebden said he wanted to play with Joran Vliegen literally five days before Turin (in November). It was so late in the season, everybody already had a partner. One of the reasons to pair with Barrientos (ranked 49) was because there's a good chance for us to be seeded, especially because we’re going into a Grand Slam.It was going to be a random pairing anyway no matter who I played with, so I thought I might as well play with somebody who I can be seeded with at least. Especially since I'm defending the title. Also, he’s very strong off the baseline, he's very quick and makes a lot of balls and that game style could work for me. I've played against him but not really hung out with him so much. Even when I played with Ebden it was similar right.He was also set with another partner, same with Yuki Bhambri.One of the reasons we said only two tournaments is because it depends where we both are ranked after the Australian Open. If I don’t defend points, my ranking drops, so then no way Barrientos and me are getting into Masters or 500 Series draws. I haven't fixed with anybody else after (Australia) because it all depends on where I am ranked and where Barrientos is ranked.Everybody has been asking me the same thing for the last two years. It is tough (to think about retirement) when for the last two years, I've qualified for the season-ending championships. When you're making the ATP Finals it means you have had a good enough season so there is no reason really to stop.As long as I'm feeling fit and physically ready to play the Masters and the Grand Slams, it (retiring) is not even a consideration.The biggest thing was how well I was feeling physically and that translated into how well I ended up playing. As a team Ebden and I were doing incredibly well, we complimented each other beautifully. What changed personally for me was that belief of being able to perform at a high level and not looking at it in terms of whether I was (doing it) at age 40, at the fag end of my career or not.First and foremost for the future of Indian tennis, we need the federation to be sorted out, all tournaments juniors or seniors are determined through a solid federation. We need to create a strong domestic circuit. More than everybody looking to play Futures, Challengers, yes we need that, but I think a strong domestic circuit (is what we need the most). Also, once a player crosses 18 they are kind of lost because there’s no platform for them to transition to the next level so players in that age-group are giving up the sport because it is too expensive to travel. In the domestic circuit, there is hardly any prize money so nobody really wants to travel. The domestic circuit needs to grow, something similar to golf maybe.Bopanna claimed the World No.1 ranking after winning his first major doubles title at the 2024 Australian Open becoming the oldest first-time No. 1 at the age of 43.Bopanna and Ebden won the 2024 Miami Masters. At the age of 44, Bopanna overtook his own record to become the oldest ATP Masters 1000 finalist and champion.",Rohan Bopanna will play with Nicolás Barrientos for just two tournaments in 2025. The World No.15 is determined to keep going after winning the Australian Open. Bopana says the future of Indian tennis is in the juniors.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116646135,imgsize-115188,width-400,resizemode-4/116646135.jpg"

Rohit Sharma: 'Virat Kohli is a modern day great. He will figure it out'

While settled is not a space athletes would choose for themselves given that the race is all about moving forward, it’s equitable usage in the world of doubles and partnerships. Ask Yuki Bhambri .The 32-year-old, mid-career in the two-man team game, played alongside seven partners before settling with the 6-ft-8 Albano Olivetti with whom he contested 16 tournaments in 2024, making four finals and winning two titles, and finishing the year with a top-50 ranking for the first time in his career.“Four finals is good effort,” Bhambri said. “I don't think this was a fantastic season, but from where I was in January to where it ended, it’s good. It's nice to start a season with an existing partnership, that gives us a little bit of an edge.”Bhambri and Olivetti have Brisbane and Adelaide in their plans before the Australian Open in January.The Indo-French combine did well in the ATP 250s but are yet to break through in the higher category events.“We're still finding our feet in bigger events, in some matches we had chances, but some others we were just blown away,” Bhambri said. “This season was more of a learning experience we can do better in the next season thanks to all that we have learnt.”Bhambri, who finished the season with an individual doubles ranking of No. 48, did something he hasn’t done in the last five years, even when his body was broken and his spirits were low. In November he lined up a group of friends for an end-of-season holiday to Norway, ticking off the Northern Lights, which has long been on his bucket list.“We were there for a week, three cities -- Trondheim, Lofoten and Oslo. It was a nice break, a lot of snow, wind and layering (clothing),” Bhambri said, adding, “This was a mixed group, six of us. The good thing that came out of being injured (end of 2018 to early 2022) is that I got to spend a lot of time at home, I became social. I had the opportunity to meet some cool people outside of tennis.”“This holiday happened at a good time, I had a good season, that’s reason to celebrate. Some of the others in the group were also celebrating anniversaries and milestone birthdays so it was just nice,” Bhambri said.The 32-year-old, who was ranked No.1 in the juniors, winning boys singles title in the 2009 Australian Open, said his biggest takeaway from the season was patience.“I remember in January and February, I was really rattled. I was hoping to kick on to the next level… and not having those wins initially was tough,” he said. “Doubles is very fast-paced and unpredictable. You could be going home happy or sad depending on one point literally. I hadn't really experienced that roller-coaster of emotions before.”“I continued to do the work and play the matches with a positive frame of mind, but I do remember going into some events earlier on where you sort of doubted yourself a little bit. I wondered if I belonged in this level or not,” he said.Bhambri shifted to doubles after sitting out three seasons, save for a couple of tournaments, struggling with tendonitis on his right knee.“In singles you can see who the better player is at times,” he said. “In doubles you could bring all the right things to the court and still end up on the losing side.”Bhambri, who climbed to a career best No. 83 in singles in April 2018, learned the importance of being ‘level-headed’ while navigating the storm of competition. It doesn’t always add up in match play, but it is important to persevere.","Yuki Bhambri and Albano Olivetti have settled into doubles partnership.

Rohit Sharma: 'Virat Kohli is a modern day great. He will figure it out'

There’s a quasi-Indian story brewing in world tennis that has set tongues wagging. A Guntur-chili eating, Tollywood-watching teenager is burning the rectangle. Only the icon against his name is the United States flag, the country he was born and raised in.Nishesh Basavareddy , born in Newport Beach, California and grew up in Carmel, Indiana, started the 2024 season ranked No. 457; he’s at a career-high No. 138 in the ATP ranking presently.The 19-year-old enjoyed a rousing run on the Challenger Tour where he made six finals, winning two titles, including one in his last outing in Mexico. The American’s show, racking up a 41-13 record, not only earned him a place in the ATP Next Gen Finals in Jeddah, starting December 18, but also saw him clinch the USTA Australian Open wildcard that secured his spot in the Melbourne Park main draw.Basavareddy studied Data Science at Stanford University for two years before announcing in early December that he was turning professional.The American teenager, bespectacled, with a studious appearance, explained the Collegiate route was what the doctor ordered for him.“I was 17 when I graduated,” he said. “I had a lot of areas where I needed to mature, it was not just physically, as a person also. I had a lot of injuries when I was a junior so I thought it would be good to get a couple more years of matches in college while also having time to develop physically and tennis wise. Turning pro straight away after high school was never really an option for me.”Basavareddy is mentored by two-time Olympic silver medallist and multiple-time major winner Rajeev Ram , who also resides in Carmel, Indiana.“When I moved to Indiana, I started working with the same coach that he (Ram) used to work with and still does,” he said. “We started meeting when he was home from the Tour. Then, when I started to play professional tennis, he gave me advice about what to expect on the Tour and what to expect in this transition.”The teenager’s father Murali Reddy works in the Tech industry while his older brother Nishanth majored in Information Systems, both played tennis, his father more recreationally, while their mother Sai Prasanna is a homemaker. Basavareddy , who visited India often in his childhood, has family in Hyderabad and Nellore.The cuisine of choice for the family is Indian. Basavareddy says he’s not fluent in Telugu but doesn’t need subtitles when he’s watching Tollywood flicks.Basavareddy, twinkled-toed and thinking cap in place, picks his tennis IQ and return game as his biggest strengths.“I watched so much tennis when I was younger, I used to always have Tennis Channel running, trying to learn from whatever commentators were saying about the pros. I just love watching tennis,” he says. “I think just being able to see so many different matches, seeing what players are doing I was able to learn different strategies that I could employ against certain players. That has evolved over time.”Tennis will get a sense of it in January Down Under, where Basavareddy, 5-ft-11, will try to outthink and outplace opponents in what promises to be an exciting first full season.","Nishesh Basavareddy was born in Newport Beach, California and grew up in Carmel, Indiana.

'Super afraid': Jannik Sinner and Iga Swiatek doping issues heighten tension among players,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/top-stories/jannik-sinner-and-iga-swiatek-doping-issues-heighten-tension-among-players/articleshow/116601911.cms,"Jannik Sinner (AFP Photo)

Professional tennis players are increasingly worried about unintentional doping violations due to contamination, especially after recent high-profile cases involving Jannik Sinner and Iga Swiatek . Both players faced doping charges but were eventually cleared. These incidents highlight the challenges athletes face regarding supplement contamination and the complexities of the anti-doping system.Sinner and Swiatek, who both reached the top ranking in professional tennis, incurred substantial expenses to demonstrate the unintentional nature of the banned substances found in their systems. This financial burden raises concerns for players with fewer resources.“A lot of the players I know are quite apprehensive,” former U.S. Open champion Emma Raducanu said.Raducanu expressed her concerns about the risk of contamination in supplements and the financial burden of batch testing. Many players are cautious about the supplements they take due to the risk of contamination.“Everything we take, we're aware of the situation and how easily things can be contaminated. There are certain supplements that I may want to take, but I can't take them because they're sold over the counter and not batch tested.”The cost of batch testing, exceeding $1,000, creates a financial barrier for many athletes.Russian tennis player Andrey Rublev , a former world number five, shared similar anxieties about consuming anything he's not entirely certain about. He admitted to being 'super afraid.'Andrea Petroczi, a researcher on anti-doping at Kingston University in London, confirmed the growing apprehension among elite athletes worldwide regarding unintentional doping violations due to contamination. Her research reveals increasing concerns among athletes about the potential consequences of such violations.“(They) expressed fear and anxiety about unintentionally violating anti-doping rules that could have grave consequences on their reputation, careers and livelihoods,” Petroczi explained.Athletes are adopting various precautionary measures to minimize the risk of contamination. These measures include thoroughly checking medications, avoiding unnecessary treatments, and opting for third-party tested supplements.Athletes also meticulously record batch numbers of supplements and medicines. Some even go to the extent of maintaining detailed logs and avoiding specific foods in certain countries. However, they recognize that even these precautions cannot entirely eliminate the risk.“Importantly, it's also crucial to acknowledge that the resources and strategies required for this level of vigilance aren't universally accessible,” Petroczi emphasized.The accessibility of resources and strategies for such vigilance varies across different regions. This disparity in access creates additional challenges for athletes in certain areas.“There is a clear 'Global North'/'Global South' divide, with disparities in education, resources and support systems, leaving many athletes more vulnerable.”Jannik Sinner's case involved trace amounts of clostebol, an anabolic androgenic steroid. He successfully demonstrated to doping authorities that the substance entered his system through massages administered by his physiotherapist.Despite being cleared, Sinner faces a potential ban of up to two years due to an appeal by the World Anti-Doping Agency. The ongoing appeal creates uncertainty regarding Sinner's future participation in professional tennis.Iga Swiatek, who tested positive for trimetazidine, a hormone and metabolic modulator, served a one-month ban. She attributed the positive test to contamination of her sleep medication.Swiatek revealed the significant financial costs she incurred in defending her case, including legal fees and expert opinions. She spent $70,000 on a lawyer and over $15,000 on expert opinions.“Importantly, it's also crucial to acknowledge that the resources and strategies required for this level of vigilance aren't universally accessible,” Petroczi emphasized.The handling of Sinner and Swiatek's cases contrasts with the experiences of other players, such as Simona Halep and Tara Moore , who have criticized the anti-doping system for lengthy delays in their cases. The contrasting experiences highlight inconsistencies in the handling of doping cases.The International Tennis Integrity Agency (ITIA) assumed responsibility for tennis's anti-doping program in 2022. The ITIA was formed by the seven governing bodies of tennis after a comprehensive review of the previous system, which was overseen by the International Tennis Federation.Sinner and Swiatek's cases are the most high-profile investigations undertaken by the ITIA since it took over. Both players held the world number one ranking when they failed their tests, further highlighting the significance of these cases.The ITIA asserts that all doping cases are handled impartially, based on evidence and facts, irrespective of a player's ranking, name, or nationality. However, concerns about potential discrepancies in the system persist.Petroczi highlighted the impact of limited access to legal representation and advanced analytical testing on an athlete's ability to effectively contest a doping case . These limitations create further disparities within the system.Being unable to access legal representation and advanced analytical testing would impact an athlete's ability to fight a doping case, Petroczi added, and sports federations and anti-doping organisations had to address this disparity in resources.Addressing the disparity in resources available to athletes requires collective efforts from sports federations and anti-doping organizations. These efforts should focus on ensuring equitable access to expert support and transparency in processes.“Efforts could include providing equitable access to expert support, ensuring transparency in processes, and exploring ways to mitigate the impact of resource gaps,” Petroczi suggested.Unlike athletes in many other sports, tennis players are essentially self-employed. Therefore, any time away from the game due to a doping ban or related legal battles directly impacts their income.Andrey Rublev advocated for quicker rulings in cases of accidental contamination and a degree of flexibility in the anti-doping rules. He believes the current system is overly strict and creates undue fear among players.“Of course, you want to have a clean sport,” Rublev stated.He emphasized the importance of maintaining a clean sport while also expressing concerns about the strictness of the current rules. He believes the system needs to be more flexible to avoid penalizing players for unintentional violations.“But you also want (it to be) not so strict because then you make all the tennis players so afraid that even those situations (that are not you fault) cost you a year.”The current system can lead to significant penalties, including lengthy bans, even in cases of accidental contamination. This creates a climate of fear among players.“It shouldn't be like that.”",Professional tennis players are increasingly worried about unintentional doping violations due to contamination.

CHENNAI: Touted as one of the brightest young players from India, 15-year-old Maaya Rajeshwaran Revathi has been called up to train at the prestigious Rafa Nadal Academy in Spain. Several top players have successfully graduated from the academy and made a mark in the sport.The Tamil Nadu teenager, who has signed a one-year contract, will begin her stint formally in January. Looking for training opportunities in Europe, Maaya chose the Rafa Nadal Academy.“We wanted her to train in Europe as it is one of the best places. The offer came directly from the Rafa Nadal Academy. They conducted a screening process for about a week or 10 days. After the screening, they offered her a contract for one year,” Manoj, Maaya’s personal coach and mentor for the past five years, told TOI on Friday.“Maaya has been assigned a dedicated coach. She will also have a coach who could travel with her for tournaments. Maaya had visited a couple of other academies and in the end, we (her coach and family) decided to take up the offer from Nadal’s academy,” Manoj added.The past few months have been pretty good for Maaya as she has defeated several top junior players in the ITF circuit . She went on to reach the final of the National Championships after getting through the qualifying stage. The stint at the academy could prove to be a game-changer and will be worth its weight in gold.“The next couple of years are very crucial for her. She needs to climb the ladder pretty quickly. I think that the focus should be more on doing well at the senior level. She needs to start doing reasonably well in the women’s circuit in another year or year-and-a-half. She has the potential to do well. On the women’s side, I think that she is the next bet forIndian tennis ,” said Manoj about Maaya, India No. 2 among juniors.While Maaya will be training in Spain, Manoj will continue to mentor her from India. “If she travels to or within Asia, maybe I could probably travel with her if that is a requirement,” Manoj said.Up next for the youngster is three ITF tournaments in India from December to January. “Maaya has opted not to play the junior Australian Open (if she gets into the qualifying draw). She has to get her visa to be in Spain for a year, so that will take a little bit of time.”","Maaya Rajeshwaran Revathi has been called up to train at the prestigious Rafa Nadal Academy in Spain.

Anmol Kharb and Anupama Upadhyay, representing Haryana, clinched the last two national titles, showcasing dominance in the women's competition. Besides, the talented 17-year-old Unnati Hooda is also from the state. Anmol made news earlier in the year, helping India win gold in the Badminton Asia Team Championships in Malaysia.""There are ranking tournaments in North now. Earlier, most of them were in Bengaluru and Hyderabad. We even have plenty of players in the U-11 category. The results we have been getting in the last three years has helped in the growth. Also, parents have realised that there is a future in badminton,"" said Harender Singh Malik, a coach at the Malik Badminton Academy in Sonipat, who added that five players from Haryana's winning team were from the academy.The emergence of several private academies has helped in popularising the sport. ""Earlier, there were just government centres with a huge number of kids. But private centres are smaller and more focused,"" said Malik.With the Haryana youngsters impressing at various levels, their progress will be closely monitored. The likes of Anmol, 17, and Unnati amongst others will be in focus as India look to carry on the legacy of Saina Nehwal and PV Sindhu ""If these girls can continue with the kind of passion they have now, they can be the next Sindhu and Saina (Nehwal). They have a chance, but they need to work hard and be more dedicated,"" said Haryana coach Ravikant Singla.It is common for young talent to fizzle out after age-group competitions. Some might fail to take their game to the next level, while others go after jobs for financial security. ""These kids are transitioning from juniors to seniors.

Head coach feels lucrative prize money & better scheduling could draw top stars

BENGALURU: Over the past five years, the number of Indian star shuttlers featuring in the individual events at the Senior national badminton championship has dwindled sharply. The ongoing competition at the Karnataka Badminton Association (KBA) here is no different. Of the six Indian men ranked inside the top 50 in the BWF rankings, only Satish Kumar Karunakaran, ranked 45, is competing, while Anupama Upadhyaya (ranked 46) and Aakarshi Kashyap (47) are the top-ranked women players in fray.As a result, Badminton Association of India (BAI) secretary general Sanjay Mishra recently said the federation in future could make the premier domestic event mandatory.India head coach Pullela Gopichand remarked, ""It’s always a challenge when you want (top) athletes to play two circuits, international and national, or national and state. Ideally, there should be only one calendar,"" he said here Sunday.""…the importance of the national championship has gone down. How do we revive it?"" he questioned.Scheduling is one of the key reasons for top players not featuring in the nationals. With the competition played at the year’s end, it is internationally offseason and an ideal resting period for the players. It is also the phase during which many of them begin preparations for the next season, which starts in early January.With star players focusing on major international events, which offer bigger prize money and ranking points, how can a player be convinced to play in the nationals?""You must give them benefits. Making it mandatory is one way, but they could just come, walk the first day, lose a match and walk off. That’s not the purpose. So, you want them to come here prepared and perform. So, either the prize money needs to be at a point where it is motivating or certain things such as an honour or a facility should be there,"" said Gopi.He also suggested the duration of the competition be reduced to three days.","Head coach feels lucrative prize money & better scheduling could draw top stars.

Poll Should KL Rahul be India's first-choice wicketkeeper for the T20 format? Unsure No, we need someone else Only if he maintains form Absolutely

It has been a rollercoaster ride for KL Rahul in ODIs over the past one and a half years. He has been India's mainstay in the middle-order and with the gloves behind the wicket.Kl Rahul delivered a stellar performance at the 2023 ODI World Cup, scoring 452 runs in 11 matches at an impressive average of 75.33. In the Champions Trophy, he again showed his class. His tally of 136 runs in the tournament might not win him many awards, but his importance to India in the middle order was immense. In the semifinal against Australia, he finished unbeaten on 42 and then steered India to their back-to-back ICC titles, finishing unbeaten on 34 off 33 balls against New Zealand in the final.The right-hander was not just outstanding with the bat but also proved invaluable behind the stumps — guiding bowlers, assisting Rohit Sharma with DRS calls, and maintaining composure under pressure.The emotions were raw and visible when KL Rahul finally lifted the Champions Trophy — his maiden ICC title. He knew exactly how much it meant to him.However, despite his efforts, he was overlooked for the ICC T20 World Cup in the USA and West Indies — a tournament India went on to win.Once an all-format mainstay, KL Rahul is once again digging deep to force his way back into India's T20I setup. In fact, it seems he is already chasing another piece of ICC silverware — the 2026 T20 World Cup. The mega event is scheduled to be co-hosted by India and Sri Lanka between February and March 2026.Will he make it back into India's T20I squad? Looking at his current form, the answer seems increasingly positive.KL Rahul is in ominous touch — playing lofted drives, straight shots, pulls, and flicks — and is as sharp as ever behind the stumps. With 364 runs in 8 matches, Rahul is currently the highest run-getter for his team, Delhi Capitals , in IPL 2025.Delhi Capitals mentor and former England cricketer Kevin Pietersen declared KL Rahul as his ""first-choice to bat at No. 4 for India.""""I back KL at No. 4 for India in T20 cricket,"" Pietersen told reporters after the Delhi Capitals' loss to Royal Challengers Bengaluru in Delhi.""You've got Rohit and Yashasvi — you've got Surya, who bats at the top, you've got all of these guys. But the way KL Rahul is playing cricket now, he would be my first choice to bat at four and keep wicket for India,"" Pietersen said.""KL has been playing in a very positive manner since mid to late last year. We saw how he finished off a couple of games for India and almost sealed the deal for you guys in the Champions Trophy in Dubai. I've had a lot of incredibly brilliant conversations with him about batting — a lot of deep and meaningful conversations — because when you grow up as a youngster like he did, you're taught defence, elbow up, playing in the V.""Then, all of a sudden, in your 30s, you've got to change and become a different kind of player for a format that's evolving all the time. It's very, very difficult. The way he has accepted that he needed to change, and the way he has changed, is great credit to the person he is.""He is so positive — the way he practices, the way he trains, the way he thinks about the game, and also the way he talks about the game,"" Pietersen said.KL Rahul (41 off 39 balls) top-scored for Delhi Capitals, helping his side post a competitive total of 162/8 in 20 overs.In response, Krunal Pandya and Virat Kohli struck half-centuries to guide Royal Challengers Bengaluru to a six-wicket win over Delhi Capitals.The duo stitched together a 119-run partnership off 84 balls as RCB chased down the 163-run target in 18.3 overs, extending their unbeaten run away from home.With the win, RCB notched up their seventh victory in 10 games, while Delhi Capitals suffered only their third loss in nine matches. Both teams remain firmly on track for a place in the playoffs.","Kl Rahul has been India's mainstay in the middle-order and with the gloves behind the wicket.

Faf back but failed

NEW DELHI: How often do we see a home crowd cheering for the opposition? But that’s exactly what unfolded at the Arun Jaitley Stadium on Sunday. The roar was deafening when Royal Challengers Bengaluru captain Rajat Patidar won the toss and opted to field against Delhi Capitals. The crowd erupted, cheering at the top of their lungs — and it was all for one man, their beloved local hero, Virat Kohli.Kohli (51 off 47) didn’t disappoint, anchoring the chase with a composed half-century, while Krunal Pandya’s majestic knock (73 not out off 47) powered RCB to a six-wicket win over Delhi Capitals, propelling them to the top of the points table.Just a couple of months ago, the scenes at the Arun Jaitley Stadium were completely different during the Ranji Trophy match between Delhi and Railways, which featured Kohli. Fans wrapped in thick jackets, mufflers, and woollen caps braved the biting cold, hands tucked into pockets, just for a glimpse of the action.This time, it was the opposite.Sweat-soaked, clutching water bottles, wiping their faces with handkerchiefs, sporting hats and sunglasses, Delhiites battled the scorching heat — all for the chance to see their superstar Kohli in action. 35000 fans flocked inside the stadium to watch Kohli in action.Every time Kohli moved to collect the ball, sprinted for a single, or struck a boundary, the stadium echoed with chants of ""Kohli, Kohli.""Kohli played the perfect anchor, constantly walking up to Krunal Pandya for quick chats, offering fist pumps, and shouting words of encouragement from the other end. His energy never dipped as he guided the partnership forward.Krunal built his innings patiently. After his superb effort with the ball, he assessed the conditions smartly, waited for loose deliveries, and made sure to dispatch them to the boundary ropes whenever they came his way.Krunal reached his half-century off 38 balls, bringing it up with a boundary off Axar Patel. Kohli, all smiles, rushed forward to hug him in celebration of a brilliant effort.Bought by RCB for Rs 5.75 crore at the IPL 2025 mega auction, Krunal scored 73 not out off 47 balls and was involved in a 119-run partnership with Kohli.Kohli, meanwhile, brought up his own half-century off 45 balls — his slowest fifty of the IPL 2025 season. The previous slowest was Vijay Shankar’s 43-ball half-century against Delhi Capitals in Chennai. He scored 51 off 47 balls before being dismissed by Dushmantha Chameera.RCB spinners Suyash Sharma and Krunal Pandya may not have picked up many wickets, but they played a crucial role in keeping the Delhi Capitals batters in check and controlling the flow of runs.It was Krunal who got under Faf du Plessis's skin, building pressure and eventually claiming the prized wicket. Krunal finished with tidy figures of 4-0-28-1 and didn't allow KL Rahul to hit a single boundary during his spell.At the other end, Suyash shared the responsibility brilliantly, conceding just two boundaries in his four overs. He ended with figures of 4-0-22-0, with an impressive economy rate of 5.50.RCB’s chase never really got going the way they had hoped. They lost three wickets for just 26 runs in the first four overs, leaving Virat Kohli visibly frustrated at the other end.Jacob Bethell (12), Devdutt Padikkal (0), and Rajat Patidar (6) all fell cheaply. Axar Patel did the early damage, removing Bethell and then castling Padikkal for a duck in the same over to leave RCB reeling.However, what really infuriated Kohli was Patidar’s dismissal. After Kohli flicked one towards mid-wicket, Patidar set off for a single but hesitated midway as the fielder released a sharp throw. A direct hit from Karun Nair caught Patidar short of his crease, leading to a run-out that left Kohli visibly furious at the way Patidar threw his wicket away.After missing five matches due to a groin injury, Faf du Plessis returned to open the innings for Delhi Capitals. However, the move didn’t work in their favour. The 40-year-old managed just 22 runs off 26 balls before falling to Krunal Pandya.In all, this was Delhi Capitals’ fifth different opening combination this season — the most by any team. Chennai Super Kings, in comparison, have tried four opening pairs so far.",Royal Challengers Bengaluru beat Delhi Capitals by six wickets. Virat Kohli (51 off 47) anchored the chase with a composed half-century. Krunal Pandya scored 73 not out off 47 balls and was involved in a 119-run partnership with Kohli.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120673869,imgsize-178272,width-400,resizemode-4/New-Delhi-Royal-Challengers-Bengalurus-Krunal-Pandya-and-Virat-Kohli-run-betwe-.jpg"

Liverpool secured their 20th English top-flight title with a stunning 5-1 victory over Tottenham Hotspur at an electrified Anfield on Sunday, sealing a record-equalling crown in emphatic style. The Reds, under manager Arne Slot, left no doubt as they turned an early deficit into a comprehensive win that saw them extend their lead to 15 points over second-placed Arsenal, making their title mathematically unassailable with just four games remaining.The match began with an air of anticipation, as Liverpool fans serenaded their team with the iconic ""You'll Never Walk Alone,"" and their team responded with attacking intent. However, Tottenham briefly threatened to spoil the party when Dominic Solanke powered home a header from a James Maddison corner in the 12th minute. The goal, which initially appeared to be offside, was awarded after VAR's intervention.The setback only seemed to galvanize Liverpool, who quickly leveled through Luis Diaz. The Colombian forward slotted home from close range following a fine cross from Dominik Szoboszlai. The home side then took the lead just minutes later, as Alexis Mac Allister rifled a thunderous shot past Spurs goalkeeper Guglielmo Vicario in the 24th minute.Liverpool were rampant, and after Tottenham's inability to clear their lines, Cody Gakpo seized the opportunity to make it 3-1, firing a low shot into the corner. Spurs, fielding a weakened side due to manager Ange Postecoglou's focus on the Europa League semi-finals, were now on the back foot.As the second half progressed, the Liverpool faithful were craving a goal from their star man, Mohamed Salah. Their wish was granted when Salah collected a pass from Szoboszlai, cut inside, and blasted the ball into the bottom corner, celebrating by taking a selfie with a fan in front of the Kop. The crowd erupted in joyous chants, and the atmosphere at Anfield reached fever pitch.The final goal came when Tottenham defender Destiny Udogie inadvertently turned the ball into his own net, sealing a 5-1 rout and sending the Liverpool fans into a frenzy. As the final whistle blew, Anfield reverberated with deafening cheers, and the celebrations began in full force.Liverpool's triumph marked their 20th league title, bringing them level with Manchester United at the top of the all-time list. It also represented a significant achievement for manager Arne Slot, who has steered the club to glory in his first season after replacing Jurgen Klopp last year.","Liverpool secured their 20th English top-flight title with a stunning 5-1 victory over Tottenham Hotspur at an electrified Anfield on Sunday.

The expression on captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni ’s face said it all as Chennai Super Kings suffered another defeat—this time a five-wicket loss to Sunrisers Hyderabad at the MA Chidambaram Stadium in Chennai on Friday. A visibly disappointed Dhoni admitted that a total of 154 was far from “justifiable” on a Chepauk pitch that didn’t have any demons, as SRH dealt a near-fatal blow to CSK’s IPL 2025 play-off chances.Also See: DC vs RCB IPL Live Score Sunrisers chased down the modest target in just 18.4 overs. Dhoni pointed out that it's always tough when several players fail to deliver simultaneously.He also believed that SRH batted under slightly tougher conditions in the second innings, yet CSK couldn't capitalise. For the skipper, the lack of cohesion in the team's overall effort was most frustrating.""I think we kept losing wickets and another thing is in the first innings the wicket was slightly better and 157 wasn't a justifiable score,"" Dhoni said after CSK’s loss.""It wasn't turning a lot, a little two-paced but nothing out of the ordinary. Yes, second innings there was a bit of help. Our spinners, the quality was there and they were bowling in the right areas, but we were 15-20 runs short,"" he added.Commenting on Dewald Brevis’ performance, Dhoni said, ""[On Brevis] I think he batted really well and we needed that in the middle order. When the spinners come in, you do it either by batsmanship or picking the right areas, but that's an area where we want to improve because middle overs are crucial.""Reflecting on the broader issues plaguing the team, Dhoni didn’t hold back.""In a tournament like this, if there are one or two areas to plug in the holes it's good, but when a majority of the players are not doing well you need to make changes. You can't just keep going. We are just not putting enough runs on the board,"" he said.With this win, SRH have moved up to eighth place on the points table, registering three wins and six losses for a total of six points.CSK, meanwhile, sit at the bottom with just two wins from nine games and only four points to show.","Chennai Super Kings lost by five wickets to Sunrisers Hyderabad on Friday.

Jasprit Bumrah breathes fire in the nets at MCG

Former India head coach Ravi Shastri expressed confidence in India's pace trio of Jasprit Bumrah Mohammed Shami , and Mohammed Siraj ahead of their five-match Test series against England in June. The series, marking the beginning of the ICC World Test Championship 2025-27 cycle, comes after India's Champions Trophy victory and their disappointing 3-1 series loss to Australia in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy .Also See: RCB vs DC IPL Live Score India's pace attack faced availability issues during their previous Test series in Australia, with both Shami and Bumrah dealing with injuries while Siraj's poor form led to his exclusion from the Champions Trophy squad.Siraj has since made a strong comeback in the ongoing IPL, taking 12 wickets in eight matches. Bumrah and Shami have also recovered from their respective injuries.""I think with Siraj, Jasprit and Mohammed Shami, these three, if they are fully fit, they will give England heaps of problems,"" Shastri said in The ICC Review. ""It's a quality, top-class pace attack when you get these three fit. And what I like about Siraj, I'm glad he was hurt after being put out, not in the side for the Champions Trophy. That's what you want.""""For him to go back to the drawing board and come back the way he has, there's a spring in his stride, the pace is up there, and he means business game after game. And that is perfect from India's point of view with England coming up.""Bumrah has shown promising signs of recovery in the IPL after the injury that forced him to miss the closing stages of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy Trophy and entirety of the Champions Trophy.Shastri emphasised the importance of managing Bumrah's workload during the England tour. ""I would be very, very careful [with Bumrah],"" he stated. ""I would give him two Test matches at a time and then wait for the break.""""Ideally, make him play four. You'll be tempted to make him play five if he starts off in a great manner, but it's how his body pulls up. He should be given the first opportunity to say, 'Yes, a little, [I am] feeling the niggle. A break would help.' Give him that break.""Shami returned to international cricket just before the Champions Trophy after recovering from a knee injury that kept him sidelined since the 2023 Cricket World Cup Final.His absence was particularly felt during the Border-Gavaskar series, where India lacked a second senior pacer to support Bumrah. Shami hasn't played Test cricket for India since the 2023 ICC World Test Championship Final against Australia.""You'll have to see how he's bowling in the nets, but I think there's enough experience there for him to start off,"" Shastri commented on Shami. ""The fact that he puts his hand up and says, 'I'm available for that first Test match' means he knows his fitness levels.""""He's a workhorse. I've known Shami for a long time. If he puts his mind to it, he'll get there. And the fact that there's Siraj and there's Jasprit doing as well as they are, that is just the motivation he needs to step up and get to that level.""The five-Test series between England and India will commence at Headingley in Leeds on June 20, followed by matches at Edgbaston, Lord's, Old Trafford, and The Oval.","Ravi Shastri has expressed confidence in India's pace trio of Jasprit Bumrah, Mohammed Shami, and Mohammed Siraj.

Today was one of our better bowling performances: Mo Bobat

In Gujarat Titans ’ inaugural season in 2022, their bowling attack was led by Mohammad Shami, Hardik Pandya, Lockie Ferguson and co. Despite Ferguson’s departure in 2023 and Mohit Sharma ’s subsequent addition, the franchise came within one ball of defending the title.Currently positioned second after 46 matches in the IPL , their strategic focus on bowling at the mega-auction has proven successful, with Prasidh Krishna (16 wickets in 8 matches) and Mohammed Siraj (12 wickets in 8 matches) leading the charge.With Kagiso Rabada having returned home for personal reasons and leg spinner Rashid Khan ’s reduced wicket-taking form, Prasidh has effectively managed crucial wickets across all phases of the game, effectively limiting opponents’ scoring opportunities. This augurs well for the Titans as the tournament enters a crucial stage.Prasidh, on Sunday, was highlighting the role of GT head coach Ashish Nehra in his impact this IPL season. “I was very clear about what I wanted to work on, made sure I put in the hours, and had the right conversations with Ashish Nehra. One thing that I’ve learned from him is about reading the conditions, the pitch, making sure you make the right decisions when you’re at the top of the mark,”Prasidh said in the JioHotstar Press Room for Race to Playoffs.. “All of these things help you be more confident. And when you’re confident, I think you would want to play as many games as possible and make sure you contribute to your team’s victory,” he added, Against DC in Ahmedabad, Prasidh’s full-length yorker dismissed KL Rahul during the visitors’ high-scoring powerplay, effectively reducing their scoring rate.It’s his personal favourite. “KL Rahul’s wicket was my favourite because I was kind of under the pressure. I was lucky that the ball swung very late and got somebody like KL Rahul,” he said, The reintroduction of the saliva rule has benefited bowlers.“It has played a bit of a part because if you look at what the ball does with the saliva on it, even if it means that one out of the 120 balls tears in a little more, that means you get a wicket that’s an extra dot ball,” he said. “And if that happens at a crucial stage when the right batsman gets out, that means you slow down the run rate and you get the momentum back. So, it has a chain reaction kind of a thing. And it definitely helped the bowlers.”","Prasidh Krishna has taken 16 wickets in 8 matches for Gujarat Titans this season. Krishna's wicket of Delhi Capitals' KL Rahul was his personal favourite. The reintroduction of the saliva rule has benefited bowlers, says Krishna.

Poll What do you believe is the main reason for Pant's poor performance this season? Team dynamics Injury concerns Lack of form Pressure of the price tag

We haven't played the perfect the match, but it's coming: Kevin Pietersen

A major reason for Lucknow Super Giants ’ inconsistent IPL-2025 campaign has been the poor form of their captain Rishabh Pant , who has scored just 110 runs in 10 matches at an average of 12.22. His run includes six single-digit scores, with a top score of 63 against Chennai Super Kings.On Sunday against Mumbai Indians , Pant managed only a two-ball four, falling to Will Jacks in LSG’s 54-run defeat. However, the struggling 27-year-old received solid backing from LSG mentor and former India pacer Zaheer Khan . Dismissing suggestions that Pant — bought for a record Rs 27 crore — is feeling the pressure of the price tag, Zaheer insisted that Pant “has been ticking all the right boxes as a leader” and just needs “something to click with the bat” to rediscover form.“I wouldn’t relate it to anything like that. He is a leader, and he has been fantastic as a leader, which I can vouch for. The kind of effort he has been putting in to ensure each individual in the group feels comfortable and heard, and his planning around everything in the IPL, has been spot on.As a leader, he is ticking all the boxes. As a batter, the middle order depends on Rishabh and I am very confident that the impact we want from him will come. It’s just about something clicking,” Zaheer said. Reiterating that the hefty price tag was not adding pressure on Pant, Zaheer said, “I wouldn’t relate it to pressure.You have seen that he is the kind of personality who doesn’t dwell on setbacks. What happened in the last game is behind him. He is very optimistic and positive.” Zaheer emphasised that Pant remains key to LSG’s ambitions. “When you’re talking about a team aiming to win the tournament, you look at leaders who can take you forward. We’ve identified Rishabh as that leader.Players will hit form and lose form — that’s how the game goes. Now, in the back end of the tournament, with pressure increasing, it’s about finding that one innings that can turn things around for anyone,” he said. Meanwhile, Zaheer expressed confidence that pacer Mayank Yadav ’s pace will improve as he gets more game time.Returning from a back injury, Mayank returned figures of 4-0-40-2 on Sunday, but clocked speeds below his earlier highs of 150-155 kmph. “It was important for him to complete his full quota of overs and stay on the field for 20 overs.

Poll Will Mumbai Indians make it to the IPL playoffs this year? No, they will falter again. Yes, they're on a winning streak!

Is 2025 Mumbai Indians ’ year in the IPL ? Playing flawless cricket, MI outplayed Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) by 54 runs to record their fifth consecutive win, propelling them to the second spot on the table on Sunday.Rising like a phoenix after a habitually low start that saw the five-time IPL champions lose four out of their first matches, MI raised hopes of a playoffs berth, thus putting to rest the bad memories of a forgettable campaign last year.It was proper teamwork that helped MI call the shots in this crucial game. While the fiery pace duo of Jasprit Bumrah (4/22) and Trent Boult (3/20) were their chief heroes with the ball, the architects of the five-time champions’ thumping victory were the in-form Suryakumar Yadav (54, 28b, 4x6, 4x4) and South African opener Ryan Rickelton (58, 32b, 6x4, 4x6).Chipping in with vital allround contributions were Will Jacks (29 & 2/18) and South African allrounder Corbin Bosch (20 & 1/26). Shrugging off his controversial exit from PSL, Bosch capitalised on the first opportunity he got after left-arm spin ace Mitchell Santner was ruled out due to a niggle.Chasing 216, LSG looked to be in contention till Mitchell Marsh (34), Nicholas Pooran (27), Ayush Badoni (35), and David Miller (24) were in the middle.

In red-hot form, Gujarat Titans will look to tighten their grip on the top spot and edge closer to a playoff berth when they face Rajasthan Royals in the Indian Premier League on Monday. Perched atop the 10-team table with six wins from eight matches, the Shubman Gill-led Titans require just two more victories to seal qualification.Functioning like a well-oiled machine, Gujarat have lost only twice this season. Sai Sudharsan and Prasidh Krishna have been standout performers, leading the Orange and Purple Cap races, respectively. Gill, Sudharsan, and Jos Buttler have each amassed over 300 runs at strike rates exceeding 150, showcasing consistency and firepower.Despite Kagiso Rabada’s early departure, Gujarat’s bowling has flourished. Prasidh has claimed 16 wickets at a stunning average of 14.12, while Mohammed Siraj and R Sai Kishore have picked up 12 wickets each, providing crucial breakthroughs.In stark contrast, Rajasthan Royals are almost out of the playoffs race following a narrow loss to Royal Challengers Bengaluru. With five consecutive defeats, the Royals are ninth on the table. While Yashasvi Jaiswal, Riyan Parag, and Nitish Rana have shown promise, their bowling failures have left them playing for pride in their remaining games.The Royals have lost both their home matches so far — by nine wickets against RCB and by two runs against LSG. At the Sawai Mansingh Stadium , the square boundaries measure 67m and 63m, with a straight boundary of 73m. The pitch offers an even covering of grass, suggesting good pace and bounce for the fast bowlers. However, with a few bare patches and a hot day ahead, the surface is expected to be dry. A par score at this venue is around 185, and any team reaching that mark should be well-placed to secure a win.Yashasvi Jaiswal, Shubham Dubey, Nitish Rana, Riyan Parag (c), Dhruv Jurel (wk), Shimron Hetmyer, Wanindu Hasaranga, Jofra Archer, Fazalhaq Farooqi, Sandeep Sharma, Tushar Deshpande– Vaibhav SuryavanshiSai Sudharsan, Shubman Gill (c), Jos Buttler (wk), Sherfane Rutherford, Rahul Tewatia, Washington Sundar, Shahrukh Khan, Rashid Khan, Ravisrinivasan Sai Kishore, Prasidh Krishna, Mohammed Siraj- Ishant SharmaYashasvi Jaiswal, Riyan Parag (capt), Nitish Rana, Dhruv Jurel, Shimron Hetmyer, Wanindu Hasaranga, Jofra Archer, Maheesh Theekshana, Sandeep Sharma, Tushar Deshpande, Shubham Dubey, Kumar Kartikeya, Yudhvir Singh Charak, Kunal Singh Rathore, Akash Madhwal, Fazalhaq Farooqi, Kwena Maphaka, Ashok Sharma, Vaibhav Suryavanshi, Sanju Samson.Shubman Gill (Captain), Jos Buttler (wk), B Sai Sudharsan, Shahrukh Khan, Sherfane Rutherford, Rahul Tewatia, Rashid Khan, Kagiso Rabada, Ravisrinivasan Sai Kishore, Mohammad Siraj, Prasidh Krishna, Ishant Sharma, Washington Sundar, Glenn Phillips, Anuj Rawat, Mahipal Lomror, Arshad Khan, Jayant Yadav, Nishant Sindhu, Kulwant Khejroliya, Gerald Coetzee, Manav Suthar, Kumar Kushagra, Gurnoor Brar and Karim Janat.Played: 7RR wins: 1GT wins: 6It is expected to be extremely warm at the Sawai Mansingh Stadium in Jaipur on Monday with temperatures reaching a high of 41 degrees Celsius and low of 27 degrees.

Poll Will Krunal Pandya continue his good form in upcoming matches? No, he won't Yes, he will

It has been a while since the world has seen Krunal Pandya the allrounder, flourishing. On Sunday evening, on a pitch designed to help the three Delhi Capitals spinners, he brought out his A game that once saw him make the Indian team.He backed up his bowling spell of 1/28 with a tenacious unbeaten 73 off 47 to help Royal Challengers Bengaluru chase down 163 with six wickets and nine balls to spare here. At 26/3 in the first four overs of the chase, Capitals would have felt their plan to play on sluggish pitch was working to a nicety.Then Krunal and Kohli happened. With the master of chasing moderately high totals holding one end, Krunal maintained his composure even as he looked clueless for the first 25 balls of his innings. It took two crisply-times sixes -- one off the backfoot over fine-leg and one down the ground over long-off -- off Mukesh Kumar to open the floodgates for RCB.Even if RCB weren’t running away with the game, Capitals were never breathing easy with Kohli milking the bowling and Krunal going about finding the fence at regular intervals. When Kohli finally fell for 51 off 47, trying to hit his first six of the innings, the score was 145 in the 18th over. The duo had set the stage for Tim David to knock off the remaining runs.It was clear RCB had targeted Mukesh Kumar -- the least potent option for skipper Axar Patel. And they ended up scoring 51 off his 3.3 overs. Earlier, Capitals played out a strange innings by current IPL standards. Had it not been for Abhishek Porel ’s fluent 11-ball 28 at the top of the innings and Tristan Stubbs clubbing 34 off 18 at the back end, the score would have looked worse than 162/8. It was strange on two counts.Firstly, the Capitals management has been yearning for slower tracks at the Kotla. Secondly, their middleorder has largely struggled the most on their home track. Much was expected of KL Rahul to regulate the pace of the innings once Capitals got off to a flyer through Porel.The Capitals batters who batted between Porel and Stubbs struggled to maintain a strike-rate of 100 for most part of their knocks, Rahul being at the centre of it. Rahul’s 41 off 39 balls seemed even more bizarre as he struggled to find his new-found power-hitting form for nearly an hour at the crease.Eventually, it turned out that the RCB bowling assessed the pitch conditions better in the first half of the match. The spin duo of Suyash Sharma and Krunal are fast emerging as one of the more dependable pairings this season with figures of 0/22 and 1/28 in their four-over spells. Josh Hazlewood and Bhuvneshwar Kumar laid out the template for pacers bowling on this pitch returning figures 2/36 and 3/33.",Krunal Pandya scores unbeaten 73 off 47 to help Royal Challengers Bengaluru chase down 163 with six wickets and nine balls to spare.

NEW DELHI: Virat Kohli found himself at the centre of criticism after an unfortunate run-out involving Rajat Patidar during the Delhi Capitals (DC) vs Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) match in IPL 2025 .The incident happened in the fourth over of RCB’s innings when Kohli flicked a Mukesh Kumar delivery towards mid-wicket. Patidar, eager to steal a quick single, responded immediately but was sent back too late by Kohli.Karun Nair, fielding at mid-wicket, showed great presence of mind.He collected the ball cleanly and fired a direct throw at the stumps, catching Patidar just short despite his desperate dive.Patidar had to walk back for 6 runs off 6 balls, and fans were quick to blame Kohli for the confusion. Social media platforms were flooded with memes and angry reactions, roasting Kohli for the costly mix-up.At that point, RCB’s score was a worrying 26/3 after 4 overs, with Kohli batting on 8 off 10 balls. It added further pressure to RCB's innings, which was already wobbling.After the run-out, Kohli faced criticism online, with fans blaming him for the unfortunate dismissal.Earlier in the match, RCB had done well with the ball. After winning the toss and choosing to bowl, they managed to restrict Delhi Capitals to 162/8. Josh Hazlewood led the charge with his tight lines, while spinners Suyash Sharma and Krunal Pandya slowed the scoring rate significantly during the middle overs.KL Rahul was the top-scorer for DC with a patient 41 off 39 balls, but it was Tristan Stubbs’ late fireworks (34 off 18) that pushed DC to a fighting total.Abhishek Porel gave DC a fast start with 28 off just 11 balls, but wickets kept falling at regular intervals. Only a strong finish in the last few overs, especially against Hazlewood and Yash Dayal, allowed Delhi to cross the 160-run mark.With RCB chasing 163, Kohli’s mistake turned into a major talking point early in their innings.",Virat Kohli run-out Rajat Patidar during IPL 2025 match.

NEW DELHI: Rishabh Pant 's nightmare Indian Premier League 2025 season continued on Sunday as Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) suffered a crushing 54-run defeat to Mumbai Indians , with the skipper's own troubles compounding after he was fined Rs 24 lakh for a slow over-rate offence.Already battling a string of poor scores with the bat, Pant's evening at the Wankhede Stadium turned worse after he managed just four runs during LSG's faltering chase of Mumbai's massive 215 for 7.To top it off, Pant was slapped with a hefty fine after LSG were found guilty of maintaining a slow over-rate — their second offence of the season under Article 2.22 of the IPL's Code of Conduct. The rest of LSG's playing XI, including the Impact Player, were fined either Rs 6 lakh or 25 percent of their match fees, whichever is lesser.""It (bowling first) was the right decision for us, we back our batting,"" Pant said after the loss. ""But today was not our day. We can figure it out because we have a break.""In-form Mumbai Indians, led by a blazing 54 off 28 balls by Suryakumar Yadav and a clinical 4-wicket burst from Jasprit Bumrah , utterly outclassed LSG. With this win, MI recorded their fifth consecutive victory, while LSG slumped to their second defeat in a row and now sit precariously in sixth place.For Pant, the problems are piling up — loss of form, mounting pressure as captain, and now financial penalties.

Poll How should AIFF handle the situation moving forward? Consult FIFA for further guidance. Stand by their decision and await CAS verdict. Revoke the trophy award until CAS concludes.

In a controversial move, the All India Football Federation (AIFF) awarded the I-League trophy to Churchill Brothers on Sunday, just hours after the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) had stayed the decision and barred any formal felicitation. The defiant act could invite further scrutiny from global bodies like FIFA and CAS.Deputy secretary general M Satyanarayan handed the trophy to Churchill Brothers at a ceremony in Goa, claiming the AIFF only learned about the CAS order after the presentation. ""I was on a flight to Goa and the AIFF Secretariat was closed on Sunday. I came to know about the order only after giving away the trophy,"" Satyanarayan told PTI.The CAS stay came on an urgent application filed by Inter Kashi, who argued that a pending points dispute could alter the final standings. Inter Kashi president Prithiijit Das asserted, ""The CAS order came around 1:30 pm IST and the mail was marked to AIFF also,"" questioning the federation's explanation.CAS deputy president Elizabeth Steiner had clearly ruled that the AIFF must not declare a winner or hold any ceremony until the arbitration concludes. The respondents, including AIFF and Churchill Brothers, have until April 29 to respond.Defending its move, AIFF later issued a statement, emphasising that the presentation was based on previous Delhi High Court and Appeals Committee rulings and that the federation would comply with CAS' final verdict.Churchill Brothers had provisionally finished atop the I-League standings, but Inter Kashi's challenge over a disputed match result could yet overturn the title race. With the CAS involved, how FIFA and the world body react remains to be seen, especially since sports federations are bound to respect CAS directives.The controversy has cast a shadow over Indian football's governance yet again.","The All India Football Federation (AIFF) awarded the I-League trophy to Churchill Brothers on Sunday, just hours after the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) had stayed the decision.

On the field, it hasn't been smooth sailing by a long shot.Over the last two days, off-the-field antics took a massive hit as well. A club that prides itself on its class and gentlemanliness, showed neither in a haughty display which veered on petulance.At La Cartuja in Sevilla, Real Madrid were outplayed by a superior Barcelona side , losing 3-2 in extra time to lift the Cup for a record-extending 32nd time. It marked a third straight defeat for Real Madrid in Clasicos this season, scoring four and conceding 12. Two of those came in the finals - first in the Spanish Super Cup and now in the Copa. As far as warming up to the big job is concerned, Hansi Flick has done an incredible job. And the job is far from finished, Barcelona remain on course for a treble.Real Madrid, meanwhile, only have the league to play for. And that is hardly an easy passage. The Carlo Ancelotti-managed side are four points behind Barcelona with five matches to go. Winning the Clasico on May 11 is vital to the club's bid to avoid a trophy-less season. If it comes in a season where your arch-rivals win a treble, that is a recipe for disaster.Before all that, though, Real Madrid's conduct pre-and-post the Copa del Rey final has come under intense scrutiny. After the final whistle, Antonio Rudiger , Jude Bellingham and Lucas Vazquez were sent off for protesting amid ugly scenes.Both Bellingham and Rudiger were required to be restrained as they had a pop at the referee. The latter could even cop a lengthy ban for throwing an object at the referee from the sidelines. Questioning the referees had started at an institutional level . For months, Real Madrid TV attacked referees for their decisions and after taking umbrage with a decision in February, the club issued an official statement labelling officiating in the country as ""rigged"" and ""completely discredited"".Furthermore, the club has refused to make players available for pitch-side and mixed zone interactions during the league - a practice followed by every other club. Instead, Real Madrid players have kept their interactions limited to the club's official TV channel.Slamming of the referees and dissection of their decisions continued until it reached boiling point on Friday. In an emotional news conference before the Copa del Rey final, officials for the high-stakes encounter hit back.Referee Ricardo de Burgos Bengoetxea broke down in tears while explaining the impact Real Madrid's attacks have had on his family life and that of other referees.VAR referee Pablo Gonzalez Fuertes, seated alongside him, suggested officials will have to take ""much more serious measures"" while hinting at a possible strike.In response, Real Madrid didn't buckle down. Instead, they went into counter-attack. They pulled out of the scheduled open training session for the media, a press conference, president's traditional dinner and a photo-call.The game went ahead, with the same officials, despite suggestions in the Spanish media that Real Madrid were considering withdrawing. The focus, well and truly, was on the referees.For the most part, the referees did a good job of keeping the game flowing despite 34 fouls being committed by both teams and seven yellow cards being brandished out.Ironically, Barcelona were awarded a penalty in the sixth minute of stoppage time when Raphinha fell under pressure from Raul Asencio. As tension crept up, the cameras panned squarely on the officials, De Burgos Bengoetxea was called to assess the incident by the VAR official. Following a brief look, the decision was overturned.In a game that had 50-50 decisions galore, and players of both sides upset with the referee, Jules Kounde drilled in a low shot past Thibaut Courtois to seal the deal.As Real Madrid looked for yet another miracle, Kylian Mbappe was penalised for a foul, getting his hand in the face of a Barcelona player. That broke all the pent-up frustration for the Real Madrid players.Rudiger, already substituted by then, threw something at the referee and was sent off. It took several players and staff to contain him as a bag of ice burst in his hands - which may well have been his next projectile. After hours to cool down, the German defender has apologised for his behaviour.Bellingham, who had already vented to the officials in the tunnel before, was then sent off, too. As was Vazquez for coming onto the pitch to protest.Ancelotti admitted he had no idea about the last two red cards. A reflection of cluelessness that has plagued the Italian manager this season. The squad has struggled to find the right structure for the team. Since Toni Kroos, Nacho Fernandez and Joselu's departure in the summer, the club hasn't filled in the right replacements.Lamine Yamal's post-match message delivered the zinger. ""They can't handle us this year, we've proven it,"" said the teenager, wearing two pairs of sunglasses, the ice-cool antithesis to Madrid's red-hot rage.","Real Madrid lost 3-2 in extra time to Barcelona in the Copa del Rey final.

What do Real Madrid want?

AS

Real Madrid 's bid to win the Copa del Rey for the 21st time, against arch-rivals Barcelona , took a massive twist on the eve of the clash at Sevilla's Estadio de La Cartuja.Instead of the Copa del Rey final focusing on Real Madrid's much-needed title bid after the embarrassing exit in the Champions League vs Arsenal, it has taken an unexpected turn towards off-field matters with La Liga chief Javier Tebas also getting involved.Ricardo de Burgos Bengoetxea , the referee appointed for the Copa del Rey final, addressed the media before the final. Referees holding a press conference is unconventional and raised quite a few eyebrows - not least at the Santiago Bernabeu and among the Real Madrid faithful.In the press conference, Bengoetxea became emotional while discussing the intense pressure he faces ahead of the match.He was questioned about a video released by Real Madrid's Club channel, Real Madrid TV, which highlighted his supposed mistakes in previous matches against them. This season RMTV have hit out at refereeing mistakes frequently and the club has refused to make its players available for mandatory media bytes with the official broadcaster for La Liga.When asked about the video, Bengoetxea could not hold back tears as he spoke about the impact on him and his family.""When your son comes back from school and other kids have said to him that his father is a thief, it's really hard,"" he said. ""They have no right to make us go through this, but it's not just something between professionals; a lot of families depend on this, and everyone should take some time to reflect on what they are doing.""Pablo Gonzalez Fuentes, who will serve as the VAR official for the Copa del Rey final, also criticised RMTV's actions. ""They have to understand the consequences of these videos,"" he said, explaining that they lead to online campaigns against officials.""We're seeing community managers on official social media platforms attacking the community for just one more like. We see actions by football players that suggest we're dishonest. When a journalist talks about 'theft,' fans take that frustration out on the child who's about to referee a youth team. We must address these types of situations and return to a healthier and cleaner style of football,"" he commented.""The consequences are that when you talk about theft and bad language, the frustration you generate in the fans is paid for by the little boy or girl who grabs a whistle and has to officiate a junior's game. It's the consequence of putting the target on a teammate's head,"" he added.After the press conference by the officials, Real Madrid, who had finished training in the Spanish capital and were to leave for Seville later, went into a huddle on a possible response.In retaliation, Real Madrid refused to hold their open training session at La Cartuja (scheduled for 8pm), a press conference with under-fire manager Carlo Ancelotti and a member of the squad. Additionally, Florentino Perez skipped the traditional presidents' dinner and the club missed the pre-match photo-call.In a statement on the club website, Real Madrid said the complaints by the referees were 'unacceptable'. ""These statements... made in a premeditated manner 24 hours before the final against one of the participants, demonstrate, once again, a clear and manifest animosity and hostility of these referees towards Real Madrid,"" said the Spanish league champions.Los Blancos took particular issue with the final's VAR referee Fuertes suggesting referees were ""united"" and looking to take collective action against the pressure they had received from Real Madrid TV.""Even more surprising statements, in a threatening tone... to announce supposed measures or actions that are far removed from the principles of fairness, objectivity and impartiality that should prevail just hours before (the final),"" continued Madrid's statement.""In view of the seriousness of what has happened, Real Madrid hopes that those in charge of the RFEF and the refereeing profession will act accordingly, adopting the relevant measures in defence of the prestige of the institutions they represent.""As per Spanish media, Real Madrid wanted the referees changed for the final and there were suggestions of the team pulling out of the competiiton and returning home.However at 10pm local time, Real Madrid rubbished those suggestions and claimed this option hadn't been considered.""In light of the rumours that have arisen in the last few hours, Real Madrid C.F. communicates that our team never considered refusing to play tomorrow's final.""Real Madrid understands that football's values must prevail, despite the hostility and animosity that has today once again been shown against our club, by the referees appointed for the final,"" said the statement.Madrid-based sports dailyreported later there was a conversation between Rafael Louzan, president of the Spanish FA , which oversees the Copa del Rey, and Real Madrid camp. It claims that RFEF acknowledged the inappropriateness of the comments made by the referees and made clear that Fuertes will not officiate Real Madrid matches for the rest of the season while leaving his role at the Technical Committee of Referees (CTA).","Real Madrid take on Barcelona in the Copa del Rey final on Saturday.

Police confirmed that Jackson Rodríguez 's family, who were abducted from their Guayaquil residence, have been safely rescued. The Ecuadorian footballer, aged 26, sought shelter beneath his bed whilst four armed assailants in hoods abducted his wife, 24, and son, 5, on Wednesday from their residence in Mucho Lote.Police commander Pablo Dávila confirmed that both mother and child were unharmed and received necessary medical care post-rescue. Despite the kidnappers' demand for USD 500,000, the family did not comply. Rodríguez currently plays as a left back for Emelec in the first division.The victims were discovered late Thursday in ""El Fortín"", a notoriously unsafe district in northwest Guayaquil where a March incident resulted in 22 fatalities.Guayaquil is situated 270 kilometres southwest of Quito.The incident occurred during a government-declared state of emergency spanning nine regions, including Guayas province where Guayaquil is located. This measure enables security forces to counter organised crime in these areas.Ecuador has experienced increased criminal activity over four years, with a surge in early 2023. Official records show 2,345 violent deaths between January and March, with 742 occurring in Guayaquil.The coastal city serves as a significant transit point for illegal drugs destined for Europe, Central America, and the United States, according to officials.Previously, other sportspersons have faced similar threats. In December, Liga de Quito player Pedro Perlaza was abducted in Esmeraldas, 182 kilometres northwest of Quito, before being rescued days later.","Jackson Rodríguez's family were abducted from their Guayaquil residence.

Poll Will Liverpool secure the Premier League title against Tottenham? No, they will not win Yes, they will win

Liverpool manager Arne Slot is preparing for a potential Premier League title celebration at Anfield on Sunday against Tottenham, needing just one point to secure the club's record-equalling 20th English championship. The achievement would come five years after their last title, which was celebrated in an empty stadium during the COVID-19 pandemic.Liverpool currently lead Arsenal by 12 points with five games remaining in their campaign, while Arsenal have only four matches left to play.""It's a big responsibility. We are aware that the last time this club won the league was during the Covid time. So everybody is looking forward to Sunday,"" Slot told reporters on Friday.""We know there's still a job to do. We need at least one point. Our fans know as well. When they come to the stadium they have to support us in the best possible way as they have done all season. It's a nice game to look forward to but also a responsibility we have for Sunday.""The title could have been decided earlier this week when Arsenal faced Crystal Palace. Liverpool's players and staff gathered to watch the match together, hoping to celebrate, but the game ended in a 2-2 draw.""It was different. Normally when you watch a game of football, you are either alone or with family or friends. But we watched it all together,"" Slot said. ""Before the game, I would have been surprised if the game ended in a draw. But during the game, I wasn't because Crystal Palace again showed what this league is all about.""The upcoming achievement would see Liverpool match Manchester United's record of 20 English titles. Slot, in his first season after replacing Jurgen Klopp, would become the first Dutch manager to win the Premier League.""No, I get these questions so it comes to your mind but it is the last thing you think of as a manager at this time. We saw last week how hard it was to get a win against a team that was nearly relegated at Leicester,"" Slot said. ""I am not getting carried away. We have faced Tottenham three times and I know how hard it is to beat them.""Liverpool's impressive season under Slot has seen them lose only twice in the league. The manager acknowledges the expectations that come with leading the club.""This club has to win trophies,"" Slot said. ""The good thing is most managers work here a long time so you have a few chances to win trophies. You are aware of that but that is not the first thing that you think about when you walk through this door.""Some have suggested Liverpool's success comes from Manchester City's decline and Arsenal's injury problems. Slot responded to these claims.""Everybody can have their own opinion. You might have a different opinion. That is the nice thing about the world we are living in. I am only here for a year so I can only tell you what I experienced,"" Slot said. ""It has never been as hard to end up in the top four or five. In my opinion it is a really difficult league.""If Liverpool fail to secure the title against Tottenham, their next opportunity would come at Chelsea in their following league fixture.","Liverpool manager Arne Slot preparing for potential Premier League title celebration.

Leicester City captain Jamie Vardy will part ways with the club at the end of the season, bringing the curtain down on a legendary spell that spanned over a decade. The club, relegated from the Premier League this year, confirmed the news on Thursday.Vardy, who famously led Leicester’s fairytale 2015/16 title-winning campaign, has been described by the club as ""our greatest-ever player.""Signed from non-league Fleetwood Town for just £1 million in 2012, Vardy went on to score 198 goals in nearly 500 appearances, becoming Leicester’s all-time top scorer in the Premier League with 143 goals. His remarkable tally of 24 goals in the 2015/16 season played a pivotal role in the Foxes’ historic title triumph.The 38-year-old also featured in Leicester's 2021 FA Cup final win over Chelsea, further cementing his status as a club legend.""We can confirm legendary striker Jamie Vardy will leave Leicester City this summer after 13 seasons that have seen him become our greatest-ever player,"" read the club's statement.""Jamie is unique,"" said chairman Aiyawatt Srivaddhanaprabha.

I am endlessly grateful for everything he has given to this football club.""Vardy admitted he was heartbroken by the decision but acknowledged the time was right.""To the fans of Leicester, I'm gutted that this day is coming, but I knew it was going to come eventually,"" he said in a video posted on social media. ""I've spent 13 unbelievable years at this club, with lots of success, and some downs, but the majority have all been highs.""Vardy, the last remaining player from the 2016 title-winning squad, stayed with Leicester after their 2023 relegation and helped them earn promotion back to the Premier League.

After relegation was confirmed following a 1-0 defeat to Liverpool, he offered a brutally honest verdict on the season.""This season has been nothing but miserable and for me personally, a total embarrassment,"" he wrote on social media.

He wrote: “Difficult weekend in Imola with P10 in race. Still early process with our new team, we keep learning. As always after a difficult one, we gonna analyse and make progress to come back stronger for the next one in Spa @cadillacvseries @jota_sport.”Encouraging him, Cadillac’s official Instagram page commented: “Building and growing,” along with clapping emojis.

With five rounds now complete in the 2024–25 Formula E World Championship, there are still 11 races to go before the season concludes in July.

He clinched victory in the Mexico E-Prix (25 points), finished second in Jeddah Part 1 (18 points), and won Jeddah Part 2 (25 points).

Formula E drivers Norman Nato and Nyck De Vries are currently in Italy for the second round of the 2025 FIA World Endurance Championship (WEC).

Nato finished 9th, while De Vries secured 5th place in the session.Norman Nato, who races for Nissan in the Formula E Championship, represents Cadillac Racing in collaboration with Hertz Team Jota in the Hypercar category of the Endurance Championship. Nyck De Vries, from Mahindra Racing’s Formula E team, finished 5th in the Imola qualifying. He competes for Toyota Gazoo Racing in the WEC, alongside teammate Ryo Hirakawa, who placed 4th in qualifying.Calling it his best effort on track, De Vries told Toyota Europe Newsroom: “As a team, I think we can be fairly satisfied with qualifying fourth and fifth here. We maximised our package, as you can see from the tiny gap between the two cars. I don’t think we could have done much better than that; we did a strong job to execute a clean qualifying. The gap to the front cars looks quite big over one lap, but we will do our best with race pace, tyre management, and strategy to challenge for the podium.”Both drivers are now set to compete in the final race of the 6 Hours of Imola on Sunday, scheduled from 1 PM to 7 PM local time.In their last Formula E outing at the Homestead-Miami Speedway, Nato faced heartbreak after losing what looked like a sure win due to post-race penalties. Although he clinched pole and crossed the line first at the Miami E-Prix, he was relegated to 6th place in the revised results.De Vries had qualified 5th in Miami but ultimately dropped to 11th in the final standings after penalties were applied.Following this, they’ll shift focus to Round 6 of the Formula E World Championship—the highly anticipated Monaco double-header on May 3 and 4.

His last podium came in Season 9, when he was part of Mahindra Racing.The 40-year-old shared his journey to the podium after the win. He said, “It’s very hard to start the project from zero so in the four races, I had four critical problems that pretty much didn’t allow me to finish the race. So I was like, it’s extremely (tough), you need to have a lot of discipline to be able to continue the work and continue to push when you have bad results.”“When you have good results, it’s very easy. But when you have bad results, to go back home, keep the focus, keep the head down and keep doing the work that you do that at one point it’s going to pay off. It’s hard because you work, it doesn’t. Then you work again, it doesn’t pay off again. And then you keep working until it pays off. And today was a day it paid off.

How Nico Mueller secured the top spot

Andretti driver Nico Mueller and his race engineer Bertrand Mermine have surged to the top of the ABB Engineered to Outrun leaderboard following a dramatic Miami Grand Prix, where post-race penalties reshuffled the final standings in Mueller’s favour. Though he originally crossed the line in 10th, Mueller was promoted to 4th, thanks to a well-timed strategy and a dash of late-race chaos. His calculated decision to split Attack Mode usage proved decisive, paying off when several drivers were hit with time penalties after the chequered flag.The Engineered to Outrun leaderboard celebrates the most dynamic driver-engineer duos in Formula E—tracking those who gain the most positions during a race, with emphasis on overtaking prowess, energy management, and overall race pace. The season concludes with an award for the top-ranked pairing.After Round 5 in Miami, the leaderboard has Maserati MSG Racing’s Stoffel Vandoorne and his race engineer Thibault Arnal on number 2. Mahindra Racing’s Nyck De Vries and race engineer Tom Bayles are in third position in the ABB Engineered to Outrun leaderboard.The FIA Formula E Instagram account also shared the update, posting:“@nico.mueller51 overtaking his way up the rankings! With a mega drive from P18 to P4, the @andrettife driver tops the @abbgroup Engineered to Outrun leaderboard after Round 5. #MiamiEPrix #FormulaE #Motorsport #Racing.”Nico Mueller’s rise was the result of strategy combined with fortunate timing. While many drivers delayed activating Attack Mode until later in the race, Mueller opted for a more aggressive strategy—using two four-minute activations, starting with the first on Lap 11 to position himself within points range.By Lap 20, Mueller was running in 10th when a red flag was brought out following a three-car collision. After the restart, as the majority of the grid scrambled to use their remaining Attack Mode activations, Mueller’s earlier strategy gave him an edge.Despite finishing 10th on the road, he was ultimately classified 4th after multiple post-race penalties were issued. Drivers including Norman Nato, Robin Frijns, Oliver Rowland, Sam Bird, and Taylor Barnard were penalized 10 seconds each for misuse of Attack Mode, while Nick Cassidy received a five-second penalty for exceeding track limits.Also Read: Formula E Miami E-Prix 2025: Jake Hughes crashes at chicane, here’s how the multi-car collision changed the outcome.

NEW DELHI: As Chennai Super Kings looked to add players whose skill sets are suited to conditions at the Chepauk, which is known for producing slow and low turners, the five-time champions bought India spinner Ravichandran Ashwin for Rs 9.75 crore during the opening day of the auction in Jeddah on Sunday.Having made his debut for CSK in 2009, Ashwin was a part of the team's title-winning campaign in 2010 and 2011.Ashwin returns to CSK after having played for Kings XI Punjab (now Punjab Kings), Rising Pune Supergiants, Delhi Capitals and Rajasthan Royals CSK shared a video of Ashwin on their official X handle where Ashwin thanks the team for picking him up.The video has Ashwin saying in Tamil, ""They say life is a circle. From 2008 till 2015, I wore the yellow jersey and played for CSK and I am always indebted to them. Whatever I learnt at CSK, has helped me hugely in my international cricket journey as well till today. It's almost 10 years since I last played for CSK, 2015 was my last season with CSK. I don't know how to express it, I was picked by CSK again in this auction.""Ashwin entered the IPL auction with a base price of Rs 2 crore, and CSK wasted no time making the first move for their original ""Super King.""Ashwin continues, ""Words like homecoming, price, etc., are there, but something that is very nostalgic for me is the fact that CSK fought for me in the same way that they fought for me way back in the 2011 IPL auction. It was a trip down memory lane for me. It is a very special feeling. I have seen a lot about our ""Anbuden"" fans on social media for the last 10 years. When I used to play for RR, I used to feel bad that I am playing against the CSK fans. They won't shout whether I am bowling or batting. Now once again, to play in front of the same fans, to play in front of that ever growing fandom, I am so looking forward to it. I am so glad to be back, to play alongside MS Dhoni and ofcourse to play under Ruturaj Gaikwad. Thank you once again.""Lucknow Super Giants joined the bidding war against CSK but eventually bowed out, only for Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) to step in and compete fiercely.The battle between RCB and CSK intensified until RCB decided to drop out, paving the way for Rajasthan Royals (RR) to join the fray.With the bid climbing to Rs 6 crore, CSK re-entered, pushing it to Rs 6.25 crore and then escalating further to Rs 7.25 crore. RR responded strongly, taking it to Rs 7.50 crore and then Rs 8 crore, as both teams recognized the value of having a seasoned spinner like Ashwin, especially with limited experienced options in the market.The Royals and Super Kings went head-to-head in an intense bidding slugfest. The price eventually soared to Rs 9.75 crore, with CSK securing the bid as RR decided to tap out.",Chennai Super Kings buy Ravichandran Ashwin for Rs 9.75 crore.

Lucknow Super Giants seek KL Rahul's replacement at IPL 2025 auction

NEW DELHI: As Rishabh Pant became the most expensive cricketer in IPL history , Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) management revealed that they invested in his positive character when they decided to pay Rs 27 crore for him on Sunday.""Pant was our No. 1 target going into the auction.We planned our auction strategy around him. We looked at the kind of impact he has on a game, proven match-winner, his positive outlook and resilience,"" Sanjeev Goenka told TOI from Jeddah after Pant’s bid.""He is a fighter. What he brings to the table is well established. It was a unanimous decision between Zaheer (Khan), (Justin) Langer, Shashwat (Goenka) and me. All our buys so far have been match-winners,"" added Goenka.For LSG mentor Zaheer, it is a bet on Pant's evolution as a leader who can infuse positivity in a group. ""I have seen him when I was in Delhi Daredevils (now Capitals) and he started his IPL journey. The way he has evolved as a cricketer is remarkable. His understanding of the game has grown. He thinks about the game. I had noticed the spark in him when he was a 19-year-old in Delhi,"" Zaheer said.Pant has often been subjected to criticism for his flamboyant brand of game. ""He can react to the various situations of a game. He has done a lot of special things in his career. I think this is the right time for him to go one step up as a leader. His positive mindset can have a big impact on a team,"" Zaheer added before offering a clarification: ""We haven't decided on the captaincy yet. But then he is always a leader. Pant, Nicholas Pooran, Ravi Bishnoi and David Miller are all expected to be part of the leadership group.""Head coach Langer, who has seen him closely during India's previous two tours Down Under, reckoned Pant's attitude off the field is special. ""I have seen him in Australia. The ability on the field aside, he is a character that can lift a team,"" said the Aussie.""I haven't spoken to him much. But I'll go to Adelaide for the second Test, give him a hug and root for Australia,"" he laughed.Once a player is paid such a hefty amount, there is always an added pressure of delivering results. ""Just wait and see how the season unfolds and how we help him de-stress,"" Goenka quipped.","Lucknow Super Giants owner, mentor, coach tell TOI that wicket-keeper's positive mindset can lift team.

World Chess Championship: Human Ding Liren must unsettle brilliantly-wired D Gukesh to retain World chess crown,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/chess/world-chess-championship-human-ding-liren-must-unsettle-brilliantly-wired-d-gukesh-to-retain-world-chess-crown/articleshow/115640661.cms,"Ding Liren and D Gukesh (FIDE Photo)

Man vs Machine has always been a common theme in competitive sport, when human and intuitive play is up against precise and programmed cold bloodedness.Usually, when any Indian sportsperson faces a Chinese rival, it is generally dubbed as Man vs Machine, the south Asian mix of skill and frailties pitted against extreme Oriental preparedness. But that perception is reversed for the World Chess Championship this time as Ding Liren is showing his human side, at least in the build-up to the match, while Gukesh is managing himself superbly.The 14-game match starts in Singapore on Monday.The 18-year-old Indian challenger is not playing exactly computer moves. He is all human but with computer-like precision and a deeper sense of calculation. On the other hand, Ding has suffered from mental issues and has frequently been showing his vulnerability under full media glare.Henrik Carlsen, the one who knows what it takes to groom multiple world champions, told Take Take Take, ""Gukesh is playing at the peak of human capacity. Way up there with Magnus (Carlsen), (Vladimir) Kramnik and (Garry) Kasparov. He is just a formidable bull. I am not sure what is going to stop him. Ding will try certainly. He is a difficult player to face at his best.""But Gukesh is fallible too. After all, unlike a chess engine, he will also have to handle emotions and time trouble.Henrik said: ""If Game 1 is not a challenge for Gukesh, he is not human. From our experience in Chennai in 2013, I can say that it’s quite a challenge. Magnus was trembling with nerves.""Therein lies a catch. Most experts believe that the starting phase of the series of games will be of great significance and hence Gukesh should strike early, and Ding must remain strong in this phase.GM Abhijit Kunte, captain of India women’s gold medal team at Chess Olympiad, said, ""Gukesh is in great form, as compared to Ding. Gukesh needs to score in the first few games. The more equal the series stays the more confidence Ding will gain. Early wins for Gukesh will finish him, like Anand did with Vladimir Kramnik in 2008.""Of course, Ding has bounced back - thrice in his World Championship match against Ian Nepomniachtchi last year. But there is a general assumption that he is no longer the same player, having reached his Elo peak six years ago. And such comebacks are exceptions, not a norm. On the other hand, if Gukesh plays too freely or becomes over-ambitious, he may invite trouble.GM and renowned trainer Swapnil Dhopade said, ""The challenger always has a psychological advantage over the world champ as he has nothing to lose.""But I have noticed an interesting psychological strategy by Ding. He is portraying himself as the underdog thereby releasing pressure and passing it on to Gukesh. But I am sure he wants to keep his WC title desperately.""GM N Srinath, Chennai-mate of Gukesh who captained India to Olympiad gold recently, said, ""Playing against a player of Ding’s class, Gukesh will of course not be able to score wins like he scores in Open events. But on the other hand, he doesn’t need to. He only requires one more win than Ding.""Judit Polgar, arguably the greatest woman to have played chess, told FIDE channel, ""Ding has much better experience and even knowledge. But chess is not about just that. It’s a sport.""Technology is 24x7. The computer has begun to teach us chess now... they are our friends, having different roles in preparation. The chess principles are not so important now, but aspect of time management and concentration is.""When Garry Kasparov lost to Deep Blue in 1997, he alleged that the ‘behaviour’ of the machine was tweaked. If Ding wants some respite, his play must interfere with Gukesh’s decision-making cells. And for that, he must revisit some of his machine-like days. Or, maybe, confuse the Indian with some human moves that had floored Nepo from better position in their last joust.",Ding Liren takes on D Gukesh in World Chess Championship match on Monday. The 18-year-old Indian challenger is not playing exactly computer moves. He is all human but with computer-like precision and a deeper sense of calculation.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115640685,imgsize-52738,width-400,resizemode-4/115640685.jpg"

's most expensive bid, snapped up by LSG for Rs 27cr and pipping Shreyas who goes to PBKS for Rs 26.75cr; KKR regain Venkatesh Iyer for flattering Rs 23.75cr

KKR's Venkatesh Iyer surprise

Can KKR solve the captaincy puzzle at IPL 2025 auction?

Just after midnight on Oct 12, when the Delhi Capitals informed Rishabh Pant that he would be retained as their highest-paid player but removed as captain, the star wicketkeeper-batter posted on X: “If I go to the auction, will I be sold or not, and for how much??”On Sunday, at the mega IPL auction in Jeddah, Pant and his fans got their answer.Sparking a bidding war among four teams, the generational talent fetched a jaw-dropping Rs 27 crore from the Lucknow Super Giants (LSG), surpassing Shreyas Iyer (bought for Rs 26.75cr by Punjab Kings ) to become the costliest player in IPL history.While Pant and Iyer broke the bank, another Iyer also raked in the moolah. In a massive surprise, Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR), after initially deciding not to retain him, used the Right-to-Match (RTM) card to secure Venkatesh Iyer for Rs 23.75cr, making him the third-highest buy of the auction.In a sentimental move, 38-year-old off-spinner R Ashwin was bought by the Chennai Super Kings (CSK) for Rs 9.75cr. CSK also splashed out Rs 10cr for Afghanistan left-arm spinner Noor Ahmed.Both Iyer, who captained KKR to theIPL 2024 title, and Pant reaped the rewards for their decisions to leave their previous franchises due to differences.This being a mega auction, some expected teams to spend conservatively to build balanced squads. That theory went out of the window when Punjab went all out, acquiring Iyer in the opening marquee set. Punjab's new head coach, Ricky Ponting—under whom Iyer captained the DC to the IPL 2020 final—was instrumental in the move, citing Iyer's leadership.However, in a pattern reminiscent of how Mitchell Starc briefly became the IPL's most expensive player in the mini-auction last year before being surpassed, Iyer's record bid was soon topped by Pant's Rs 27cr acquisition by LSG.Once teammates at DC, Pant and Iyer have displayed remarkable resilience to bounce back from adversity. Pant's return from a near-fatal road accident is the stuff of fairy tales. For Iyer, the windfall capped a rollercoaster 2024: Exclusion from BCCI's central contracts list, leading KKR to their third IPL title, stellar domestic performances, and now this record-breaking payday.DC tried to retain Pant, matching bids up to Rs 20.75cr using the RTM card. However, LSG sealed the deal with their Rs 27cr bid.Like Iyer, Pant is expected to lead LSG next season, which begins on March 14.Venkatesh Iyer's massive payday from KKR, despite not being among their retained players and has hardly bowled under the Impact Player rule, was one such stunner.Punjab, equipped with a hefty purse, also made significant purchases, including reacquiring left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh for Rs 18cr. and signing Yuzvendra Chahal for the same amount. Among other notable moves, KL Rahul found a new home with the DC for Rs14cr where he might captain.Mohammed Shami, returning from injury, was bought by Sunrisers Hyderabad for Rs10cr, while Gujarat Titans secured Mohammed Siraj for Rs 12.25cr.SRH also signed wicketkeeper-batter Ishan Kishan for Rs 11.25cr. Meanwhile, Kagiso Rabada joined Gujarat Titans for Rs 10.75cr.",Rishabh Pant becomes the most expensive player in IPL history with Rs 27cr bid from Lucknow Super Giants. Shreyas Iyer pips him to the top spot with a bid of Rs 26.75cr by Punjab Kings.

Having retained their top six players for Rs 75 crore, the Mumbai Indians had only a Rs 45 crores purse for the mega auction and swung into the action only late in the day when they snapped up New Zealand’s veteran left-arm pacer Trent Boult , known for his lethal yorkers and early strikes for Rs 12.50cr. It means that Boult, who took 16 wickets in IPL2024 but was still released by the Rajasthan Royals, will wear the MI jersey again and be reunited with India’s ace pacer Jasprit Bumrah at MI.Boult finished with 12 wickets in the Powerplay, the most for a bowler in IPL-2024.The ‘jugalbandi’ of Bumrah and Boult was instrumental in MI’s title-winning campaign in 2020. It was their fifth and last crown.Overall, Boult, 35, has represented as many as five teams Sunrisers Hyderabad before moving to Kolkata Knight Riders, Delhi Capitals, MI, and RR in the cash-rich league.So keen was R Ashwin on the Chennai Super Kings buying him that he even ‘sold himself’ to the franchise in a mock auction on his YouTube Channel. Ultimately, it did turn out to be a case of ‘home sweet home’ for the veteran India off-spinner as he was acquired by CSK for Rs 9.75cr.With RR deciding to invest in youth, Ashwin had a chance at going back to CSK for whom he played from 2010 to 2015.",Trent Boult joins Mumbai Indians for Rs 12.50cr.

It was difficult to wait for my debut, says Harshit Rana

What is it about young Indian batting talents and Perth that makes the venue a perfect stage to showcase their wares to the world?The reverberations of an 18-year-old Sachin Tendulkar's 114 in 1992 at the WACA are still felt. Virat Kohli's twin knocks of 44 and 75 at the WACA 20 years later showed everyone what he is made of and on Sunday, Yashasvi Jaiswal stamped his class by smashing a majestic 161 (297 balls, 15x4, 3x6) his fourth hundred, all of them 150-plus, at the Optus Stadium on Day Three of the first Test of the Border Gavaskar Trophy to lay claim on the tag of 'The Prince'.Meanwhile Virat Kohli 100* (143b, 8x4, 2x6), 'The King', then pulverized a frazzled Australian attack for his 30th Test century and his first in the last 16 months.The moment the Indian veteran reached triple figures, his second at the Optus after his heroics in 2018 in a losing cause, Indian skipper Jasprit Bumrah declared with the score at 487-6. It left Australia a target of 534 to chase in 25 minutes and two days.The hosts, tired after being in the field for 134.3 overs, ran into an inspired Bumrah again to slump to 12 for 3 in 4.2 hellish overs.Debutant opener Nathan McSweeney could not negotiate the fourth delivery from Bumrah's first over that hit a crack, kept low, darted in at speed and thudded into the pads to fall for a duck.Australians under Steve Waugh rarely opted for a night watchman, but on Sunday, with 20 minutes remaining, Pat Cummins walked in to protect the established batters. But he left soon as he edged a searing outswinger from Mohammed Siraj to Kohli at second slip.At 9 for 2, Australia declared May Day. It soon became 12 for 3 as Marnus Labuschagne left an incoming delivery from Bumrah's final over to be trapped leg before. He even burnt a review.India's dream day had turned into a nightmare for the hosts as openers Jaiswal and KL Rahul continued from where they left on Day Two (172-0) and took the score to 201, India's highest opening stand in Australia.Jaiswal, who resumed Day Three on 90, reached his ton with a ramped six off Hazlewood when on 95 and then spread his arms wide to soak in the applause.Rahul played a few delightful strokes to get to his 50 and move quickly to 77 before edging Starc to wicket-keeper Alex Carey.Devdutt Padikkal batted steadily for 25. All this while he watched Jaiswal launch into an offensive at the other end.India took lunch at 275 for 1, but lost Padikkal immediately after the interval as Australia struck with the new ball with Hazlewood having him caught at second slip by Steve Smith.Kohli exchanged a fist pump with Jaiswal as he walked in at four radiating positivity. With the wicket easing, he chose to bat inside the crease and not indulge in aggressive forward movements that prevented him from negotiating a rising delivery from Hazelwood in the first innings.He also allowed Jaiswal to take control as the young left-hander drilled Cummins authoritatively through widish mid-off to pass 150.A third double looked a certainty, but he slapped an innocuous Mitchell Marsh long-hop to Smith at backward point.India then endured a mini collapse of 8 for 3 when Lyon had Rishabh Pant stumped and Cummins got one to skid low and rap Dhurv Jurel on the pads.But Washington Sundar's sound defence at the other freed up Kohli. Although there was skittish running from the pair, they added 79 crucial runs with Kohli's punch down the ground off Cummins and his slap over point for six off Starc making it to the highlights reel.When Sundar missed a hoick off Lyon and was bowled, Nitish Reddy 38* (27b, 3x4, 2x6) walked in with T20 intent and a message that the team was looking to bowl tonight itself.That got Kohli to unfurl the sweeps and reverse sweeps from his closet. And he got to his hundred with a sweep off Labuschagne who looked to bowl wrist spin outside leg-stump to curb the scoring.Unaware that the ball had reached the fence, Kohli's celebrations were initially muted. After confirming that he had indeed moved from 96 to 100, he took off his helmet to acknowledge the crowd. That done, he then blew a kiss to wife Anushka in the member's stand.","Yashasvi Jaiswal smashes 161 (297 balls, 15x4, 3x6) at the Optus Stadium on Day Three of the first Test of the Border Gavaskar Trophy.

San Siro bore draw

Inter Milan moved top of Serie A on Saturday after a first-half blitz led to the Italian champions sweeping sorry Verona aside 5-0 and going two points clear, while AC Milan played out an uneventful goal-less draw with Juventus.Simone Inzaghi's side are provisionally ahead of Napoli after netting all five of their goals in the opening 45 minutes at the Stadio Bentegodi through a Marcus Thuram brace and further strikes from Joaquin Correa, Stefan de Vrij and Yann Bisseck.Atalanta will claim top spot with a win over promoted Parma in Saturday's late match, while on Sunday Napoli host Roma on Claudio Ranieri's return to top-flight management.Correa's opener in the 17th minute, a delightful dink after smart interplay with Thuram, didn't just spark a rout, it was also the Argentinian's first Serie A goal in over two years.Out-of-favour Correa had only played 38 minutes this season before this weekend but was excellent in place of captain and star striker Lautaro Martinez who was sent home early on Saturday with the flu.""I know him well, he's been training brilliantly since July, he's got a lot of competition,"" Inzaghi told DAZN.""I'm pleased for him but I'm also pleased for the boys because they played really well,"" he added.Correa, 30, hit the woodwork twice and also laid on Thuram for the first of his two near-identical goals, which were netted within the space of three minutes and came after the France forward skipped around Verona goalkeeper Lorenzo Montipo.By the time defenders De Vrij and Bisseck -- with another strike set up by Correa -- lashed in unlikely finishes Verona were submerged in boos and whistles from the home support who loudly chanted for their team to ""show some balls"".Verona have lost nine of their 13 league matches this season and sit 14th, just three points above the relegation zone.Inter now host Leipzig on Tuesday as they push for direct qualification for the last 16 of the Champions League, having thumped Verona with a clutch of starters either injured or rested.As well as Martinez, Hakan Calhanoglu, Federico Dimarco and Benjamin Pavard missed Saturday's match after a busy period on international duty.Juve trail Inter by three points in sixth place after offering little to shout about at the San Siro.Ravaged by injuries, including to starting centre-forward Dusan Vlahovic, coach Thiago Motta was forced into an experimental line-up featuring midfielder Teun Koopmeiners up front.Despite the depleted line-up Juve had more shots on target -- two to one -- in a hugely disappointing contest in front of a crowd of more than 75,000.""I'm pleased with our performance, especially defensively against a team which created very little,"" Motta said to DAZN.""All in all we played well, I think a point right now keeps us going. I'm happy to see that we're well-organised and are capable of playing like a big team should.""Milan, who started with former Juve forward Alvaro Morata leading the line, were unable to break down Juve and are seventh, nine points behind their league-leading local rivals with a game in hand.Paulo Fonseca's side failed to trouble Juve goalkeeper Michele Di Gregorio until stoppage time with a weak header from Theo Hernandez, which was followed shortly afterwards by a hail of whistles from annoyed home fans.","Inter Milan thrash Verona 5-0 to go two points clear in Serie A.

Vigo: La Liga leaders Barcelona suffered a dramatic collapse in a 2-2 draw at Celta Vigo on Saturday.Raphinha and Robert Lewandowski's goals put the Catalans in a healthy position but Marc Casado's red card in the 82nd minute helped Celta snatch a point.Alfonso Gonzalez capitalised on a Jules Kounde error to pull a goal back before Hugo Alvarez levelled two minutes later.Barcelona have won 11 league games this season but this became the third they have failed to take three points from without teenage winger Lamine Yamal.Coach Hansi Flick said he would challenge his side to win without the injured 17-year-old wing wizard and it seemed like they were managing it until their spectacular late crumble.Barcelona are five points clear of Atletico Madrid at the top of La Liga, with champions Real Madrid, third, playing on Sunday at Leganes.""We had the game under control but the red card had a big impact on us and they scored two goals in two moves and we have to learn from that,"" Barcelona midfielder Gavi told DAZN.""The first goal was so stupid, we have to clear the ball there, but it's football and we have to learn from it, with one man less it's hard.""Gavi made his first start in over a year after recovering from a severe knee injury.""I'm happy, after a year, but the truth is the important thing was the three points and it wasn't possible,"" added the 20-year-old.Flick shifted Raphinha into Yamal's position on the right, using Dani Olmo on the left and Pedri in attacking midfield.Raphinha opened the scoring in the 15th minute, slotting home neatly to continue his fine form after Kounde lofted a ball forward for him.Barcelona left-back Gerard Martin was issued an early booking and lived on the edge in the first half, nudging over Iago Aspas as he ran through but just about staying on the right side of the law.The defender then fouled Aspas before half-time and was lucky to escape a second booking as Celta's captain fumed and was issued a yellow card himself for his outburst.Flick brought off Martin at the break for Hector Fort, fearing a potential dismissal.Hunting for Barcelona's second, Lewandowski had produced a fine lobbed finish in the first half but the goal was chalked off for offside.The forward was not to be denied though and just after the hour mark he stroked home Barcelona's second after Raphinha played him in.It was the 36-year-old striker's 15th league goal of the campaign, further extending his vast lead as La Liga's top scorer.Inaki Pena made a handful of saves for Barcelona, denying Hugo Alvarez with his leg.Raphinha could have killed the game off completely but the winger hit the post with a low effort after being sent through.The Catalans were reduced to 10 men after 82 minutes when recent Spain debutant Casado picked up his second yellow card for fouling former Barca midfielder Ilaix Moriba.It restored Celta's belief and moments later they pulled one back when Kounde dallied on the ball in his own area and Gonzalez picked his pocket and finished past Pena.Two minutes later Alvarez levelled for Celta as Barcelona collapsed, cutting in from the right and finishing clinically to snatch a point.Celta, 11th, have a strong record at Balaidos against Barcelona in recent years and the players celebrated with their fans at the end of the game.""We found ourselves with that red card and the (first) goal, and then the second came, it's inexplicable,"" said a delighted Alvarez.""We got the draw, we wanted more -- this team has great quality.""",Barcelona held to a 2-2 draw by Celta Vigo in La Liga on Saturday. Raphinha and Robert Lewandowski put the Catalans in a healthy position. Marc Casado's red card in the 82nd minute helped Celta snatch a point.

NEW DELHI: Tottenham delivered a crushing 4-0 victory at the Etihad, ending Manchester City 's impressive 52-game unbeaten home streak on Sunday.The first half saw James Maddison score twice within seven minutes, followed by Pedro Porro's goal against his previous club and Brennan Johnson's finishing touch to complete the victory.This defeat, City's first at home from open play since before the 2022 World Cup, leaves them trailing Premier League leaders Liverpool by five points.Liverpool have a game remaining against bottom-placed Southampton on Sunday.The victory provides relief for Tottenham and Ange Postecoglou as they advance into the top six positions.Despite recently extending his contract until 2027, Pep Guardiola faces the challenge of addressing the worst performance streak in his managerial career.The anticipated revival of the four-time consecutive Premier League champions following Guardiola's new contract failed to materialise.Before the match, Rodri displayed his Ballon d'Or trophy to supporters, with his name illuminated across the Etihad pitch.The Spanish midfielder, aged 28, is sidelined for the remainder of the season due to knee ligament damage sustained in September, and his absence has significantly affected City's performance.City began positively with Guglielmo Vicario stopping Erling Haaland's attempt, followed by another deflected shot from the Norwegian.The match's direction shifted dramatically with Tottenham's first serious offensive move after 13 minutes.Dejan Kulusevski provided an excellent cross to Maddison, who finished with precision.Recently excluded from Postecoglou's starting lineup, Maddison was determined to demonstrate his worth.Son Heung-min's creative pass enabled the England player to score his second goal, lifting the ball over the advancing Ederson.Tottenham's season has been marked by fluctuating performances.Following a 2-1 home loss to Ipswich before the international break, which dropped them to 10th position, they have now secured two significant victories in Manchester, including a 3-0 win at Old Trafford.Ederson made an excellent save to prevent Dominic Solanke from scoring before halftime.Seven minutes into the second half, Kulusevski's cross found Solanke, who assisted Porro's powerful close-range finish.Haaland nearly scored from an acute angle, hitting the crossbar as City struggled to respond.The final blow came when Timo Werner outpaced Kyle Walker and crossed for Johnson to score at the far post. Kevin De Bruyne 's return as a late substitute after two months offers City some optimism.However, Guardiola must find quick solutions to maintain their title defence, with a challenging visit to Anfield next, where City haven't won before spectators since 2003.","Tottenham beat Manchester City 4-0 at the Etihad on Sunday.

KOCHI: Kerala Blasters hope to arrest their downward spiral when they face an in-form Chennaiyin FC in the Indian Super League at Jawaharlal Nehru International Stadium , Kochi, on Sunday.Chennaiyin are placed fourth in the ISL standings with three victories, three draws, and a couple of defeats. In contrast, the Blasters are languishing in tenth place and have just two wins all season. They are going into the match after suffering a hat-trick of losses.The Blasters’ current predicament is largely due to injuries and the form of several key players. Their offensive capabilities were hampered following Noah Sadoui's injury during their defeat against Bengaluru FC.Adrian Luna, the Blasters’ stalwart in recent seasons, looks a pale shadow of himself after returning from injury. Despite earnest efforts from Jesus Jimenez and Kwame Peprah in attack, they haven’t received adequate support up front. Kerala Blasters FC head coach Mikael Stahre said that his team needs to fix some defensive issues, but highlighted an important issue that might have slipped under the radar too.""We have conceded too many goals (16) and we need to find a solution for that. But, it’s not like we’ve conceded too many chances, so that helps, as it would have been worse had we conceded a lot of goal-scoring opportunities as well,"" Stahre said.Chennaiyin FC head coach Owen Coyle expressed his gratitude towards the supporters of Chennaiyin FC who will be travelling for the match against Kerala Blasters FC in Kochi. ""There are a few hundred fans who will be coming for the away game against Kerala Blasters FC. We are thankful for them since they support us everywhere we go.

Alaaeddine Ajaraie could not continue his record-breaking scoring spree to the ninth Indian Super League game. Their defensive strongman Asheer Aktar received his first yellow of the season in a Saturday clash that saw seven yellow cards, and a red.However, it was the resolve and grit of North East United FC that earned them a hard-fought 2-1 victory against Punjab FC in New Delhi, despite playing the second half with 10 men.The win — their 4th in nine games — extended their unbeaten run to four and broke the trend of losing points late on.They had fired in both their goals in the opening 20 minutes with Ajaraie turning provider to Giullermo Hierro’s 15th minute opener and No. 10 Nestor Albiach drilling in the second with a perfect volley in the 18th minute. The win propelled Juan Pedro Benali ’s men to the third spot with 15 points — two points behind new leaders Mohun Bagan Super Giants , who went atop beating Jamshedpur FC 3-0 at the Saltlake stadium in Saturday’s second game, and Bengaluru FC.Benali stuck to his preferred 4-2-3-1 formation as Punjab FC adopted a physical approach from the outset to disrupt NEUFC’s attacking force with the referee brandishing three yellow cards – two to Punjab and one to NEUFC defender Dinesh Singh – within the opening 10 minutes, reflecting the intense nature of the contest.Ajaraie had his first shot on goal — his 45th of the ISL season and the only one of the game — in the 9th minute, but it was in the 15th minute that NEUFC broke the deadlock. Macarton Nickson sent a cross from midfield to Alaaeddine on the left side of the box, and the Moroccan delivered a precise cross at the goalmouth for the onrushing Gillermo to guide into the net.Just three minutes later, the Highlanders had doubled their lead. Winger Buanthanglun Samte, who enjoyed ample space on the left flank, sent a cross into the box, and Albiach was on hand to volley the ball past the Punjab FC goalkeeper Ravi Kumar with precision and power.However, Punjab coach Panagiotis Dilmperis’s words at the half-hour drinks break was heeded by his players as they began attacking in search of an equaliser. Lead striker, Luka Majcen, came close to scoring on a couple of occasions, but the visiting defenders held firm.With the hosts pushing hard, Dinesh earned his second yellow card for an unnecessary foul just outside the box in the 5th minute of first-half added time, reducing NEUFC to 10 men.Punjab earnestly tried to take advantage of their numerical superiority after the change of ends, maintaining most of the possession and registering all shots on target, but their efforts were met by the Highlanders’ defence, led by skipper Miguel Zabaco.Their perseverance, however, paid off in the 88th minute when NEUFC custodian Gurmeet Singh failed to hold on to a shot from Asmir Suljic, and defender Ivan Novoselec was in the right place to score on the rebound, reducing NEUFC’s lead.Despite the late goal, NEUFC held their nerve to secure a crucial three points, keeping their team in the hunt for a top-four finish.","North East United FC beat Punjab FC 2-1 in Indian Super League.

KOLKATA: Mohun Bagan SG moved to the top of Indian Super League standings with a comfortable 3-0 win over Jamshedpur FC at the Salt Lake Stadium on Saturday. A Liston Colaco magic on the cusp of half-time on either side of goals from Tom Aldred (15th minute) and Jamie Maclaren (70) handed Jose Molina ’s side their fifth win in eight games.Both Mohun Bagan and Bengaluru FC have 17 points each, but Colaco and Co.are topping the table thanks to a better goal difference. Jamshedpur FC have 12 points.While Mohun Bagan’s progress under Molina is on the upswing, it’s another blow to the faltering Jamshedpur FC. Khalid Jamil’s team which had won four of their first five matches, has now suffered three losses in a row, conceding 13 goals. Jamil was suspended from the match but his assistant Steven Dias could do little to stop the team from going into a free fall.Before the kick-off, Mohun Bagan fans group Mariners Arena unveiled a giant tifo paying a tribute to the club’s foreign players and their family members. And Molina’s brigade lived up to expectations with a clinical and confidence-oozing performance.Mohun Bagan deservedly went ahead in the 15th minute with a number of players involved in the lead-up to the goal. A Petratos corner was initially cleared out of the Jamshedpur FC box. But Deepak Tangri, starting in place of injured Asish Rai, took an ambitious shot from outside the box. As the ball bounced off a JFC defender’s feet and went up in air, Alberto Rodriguez headed it on the path of fellow defender and Aldred came up with an acrobatic half-volley beating the goalkeeper all ends up.Albino, however, denied Petratos and Liston with a couple of alert saves in quick succession but when Bagan’s No. 17 came calling in the first-half injury time, he could only watch hopelessly how the rival left the defence in shreds.Having received the ball from Manvir Singh, Liston cast his spell on the entire JFC defence in no time. On entering the box, his body feints were jaw-dropping as he took the challenges from Jamshedpur’s Tangkhulnao, Stephen Eze and Subham Sarangi in his stride one after another with wonderfully executed fakes and feints before coolly placing the ball in past a hapless Albino.That goal virtually killed the game as a contest. Although JFC tried to generate some semblance of fight after the break, the man-of-the-match Manvir came up with another assist following Tangri’s long ball, rounding the goalkeeper and laying it for Maclaren to tap it into an open net.",Mohun Bagan SG moved to the top of Indian Super League standings with a comfortable 3-0 win over Jamshedpur FC at the Salt Lake Stadium on Saturday.

Chelsea secured a 2-1 victory against Leicester City at the King Power Stadium , moving them closer to the top of the Premier League table.Nicolas Jackson and Enzo Fernandez scored for Chelsea, while Jordan Ayew netted a late penalty for Leicester.Chelsea's win, their first after two consecutive draws, propels them to 22 points, trailing league leaders Manchester City by a single point and maintaining a three-point advantage over fourth-placed Arsenal.Leicester City manager Enzo Maresca expressed his pride in his team's performance despite the limited preparation time following the international break.“The only thing I asked the players before the game, I said, 'Guys, we have the chance today to make a statement in terms of (who) we are',” he told TNT Sports.“Because when you play this kind of game, all the clubs that they are behind, like in this moment, I don't know, Arsenal or Villa or Brighton or (Manchester) United, Tottenham, they are watching.“They are waiting for us to drop points. And we show that we are there. And we're going to compete until the end and then we'll see where we arrive.”The match marked Maresca's return to the King Power Stadium, where he guided Leicester City back to the Premier League in his sole season with the club.Chelsea dominated the early stages, with Joao Felix, making his first Premier League start of the season, testing the Leicester defense.Chelsea's breakthrough came when Nicolas Jackson outmuscled Leicester defender Wout Faes, receiving a pass from Enzo Fernandez and slotting the ball home for his seventh league goal of the season.Leicester goalkeeper Mads Hermansen denied Noni Madueke, and Madueke had a goal ruled out for offside in the first half.Leicester grew into the game, creating chances through Oliver Skipp and Wilfred Ndidi.Chelsea had an opportunity to extend their lead early in the second half but failed to convert a golden opportunity, with Madueke inadvertently blocking Cole Palmer's goal-bound shot.Fernandez eventually doubled Chelsea's lead, heading in after Hermansen saved Jackson's header.Leicester substitute Stephy Mavididi had a penalty appeal turned down before fellow substitute Jordan Ayew converted a penalty in stoppage time.The penalty proved to be a mere consolation for Leicester, who remain precariously close to the relegation zone, just three points above the drop zone.","Chelsea beat Leicester City 2-1 at the King Power Stadium.

CHENNAI: Irfan Yadwad ’s rise in Indian football over the last few years has been nothing short of remarkable. In 2020, the young forward was asked to contemplate quitting the sport after enduring a meniscus injury in a local tournament in Chandor, Goa.But Irfan recovered from the setback and kept going, thanks to relentless support from his father. It took him only a couple of years to break into the top flight, with his stellar performances at I-League 2 (third tier) club FC Bengaluru United not going unnoticed.While the 23-year-old had a slow start to life at Chennaiyin FC , he has gathered pace in the ongoing Indian Super League season. Irfan, under the guidance of Chennaiyin head coach Owen Coyle, proved to be impactful in the first phase of ISL 2024-25 and it was enough to convince national team manager Manolo Marquez to call him up.Dream turned into reality when Irfan made his India debut and led the line in the recent friendly against Malaysia in Hyderabad. “The journey has been great. It has been about my hard work,” Irfan told TOI ahead of CFC’s away ISL fixture against Kerala Blasters FC in Kochi.“About four years ago, I was out of football for three months after suffering a meniscus injury. My mother cried every day and asked me not to continue playing. It was tough to get my rhythm back. But my father pushed me every day, saying that I can play (at a high level). From that day, everything that I have been doing has been for my family. My parents dreamt of seeing me in the national team. Now, they are proud of me,” added Irfan, owner of a goal and two assists in eight appearances in the current ISL campaign.Irfan could not get on the scoresheet in his maiden outing in India blue, but earned praise from Manolo, who said: “He played a good game. He is a player with a very good future.”Talking about his first experience in the national team, Irfan said: “It was a great feeling. Manolo asked me to do what I have been doing at Chennaiyin. After a few training sessions, he told me that I would start. This is just the beginning (of the India journey). I want to do more for myself and my family. I want to make it to the India team again and again.”Coyle, a forward in his playing days, has had a huge influence on Irfan’s rapid rise. “This season, Owen has given me a new role as a winger. It has been great working with him, he knows my feeling because of how hard I have been working in every session. He trusts me a lot and speaks to me regularly, which helps me improve.”",Irfan Yadwad made his India debut against Malaysia in a friendly.

They counted on me to deliver and I didn't deliver, so that's on me,"" said Diallo.Altmaier admitted he felt extremely nervous ahead of the match.""Definitely the nerves were a lot, I was saying to the captain in the morning when I was warming up I was really nervous coming up to the match,"" he said.""I guess (it) helps me a lot to communicate this openly, not to hide away my nerves.""","Germany beat Canada 2-0 in Davis Cup quarter-final in Malaga.

Every time I return for a season of Major League Cricket (MLC), I see progress. This is MLC Season 3, and it's already showing signs of becoming something truly special – not just for the fans who show up in numbers, but also for the players, coaches, and everyone behind the scenes trying to make cricket big in the United States.When I first got involved, people were still unsure whether this was a passing interest or a long-term vision. Well, three seasons in, it's clear we’re here to stay. The quality of cricket has improved. The local talent has gotten better. The international stars are turning up in big numbers. And now, we’re playing in iconic venues like the Oakland Coliseum – that's growth.Of course, there are challenges. The US isn’t like India or the Caribbean where cricket is integral. Most of the current fanbase comes from South Asian, West Indian or South African communities – people who brought the game with them. The next step is getting more Americans involved, and that’s going to take time and investment. But you know what? We've already started, and that's what matters.As a coach, I love being part of this journey.My job isn’t just to strategise during the match – it’s also to pass on what I’ve learned, to help these young players understand the tempo of the game and to bring out their best. The skills are there. The passion is there. Now it’s about building confidence, playing fearlessly, and learning how to adapt.Infrastructure is another big piece to the puzzle. Our owners are already investing in a stadium in Los Angeles, and with the Olympics coming up in 2028, I hope that stadium will one day host cricket on the world’s biggest stage. That’s the vision. Franchises will hopefully build their own grounds and start academies. That’s how you create a pipeline.We’ve already seen signs that this system is working. The USA national team surprised a lot of people at the T20 World Cup. Some of those players came through the MLC system. Imagine what can happen in five more years.Will cricket ever be as big as baseball or basketball in the US? I’m not sure. For a sport to reach that level here, it has to be homegrown, something the entire country embraces. But don’t count us out. There are powerful owners, passionate fans, and most importantly, players who are hungry.With the Olympics, World Cups and ICC events on the calendar, cricket now has the global stage. The US can be a part of that – in fact, it already is.And me? I’m loving this phase. Coaching feels like my calling. I’ve had my time on the field. Now it’s about helping others find their moment. Teaching players to love the game, stay grounded, and stay hungry – that’s what matters.The US is learning to love cricket. The fans are coming. The players are ready. And the best is still to come.","Dwayne Bravo is the head coach of the Los Angeles Knight Riders in the Major League Cricket in the USA.

IND vs ENG 1st Test: KL Rahul’s grit, Rishabh Pant’s fire keep India alive

NEW DELHI: It wasn’t one, it wasn’t two — it was Yashasvi Jaiswal ’s fourth dropped catch of the match, and it came at a crucial juncture on the final day of the opening Test against England at Headingley.With India’s bowlers toiling hard for a breakthrough and the pressure mounting, Mohammed Siraj created a golden opportunity. He dug in a short delivery to Ben Duckett, who mistimed a pull and got a top edge. Jaiswal sprinted in, dived forward, got both hands to it — but couldn’t hold on.The frustration was evident. Siraj looked visibly irritated, skipper Shubman Gill wore a look of disbelief, and when the camera shifted to head coach Gautam Gambhir , his anger was unmistakable.Jaiswal’s fourth drop in the match equals the most by an Indian fielder in a Test, as per available records — a statistic he’ll want to quickly forget.Earlier, India set England a target of 371 to win the first Test of the Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy after being dismissed for 364 in their second innings.KL Rahul and Rishabh Pant were the standout performers with the bat. Rahul produced a calm, composed 137 — his ninth Test hundred — studded with 18 fours. Pant, initially restrained, switched gears to blast 118 off just 123 balls, hitting 15 boundaries and three sixes. It was his eighth Test ton and part of a 195-run partnership with Rahul.The duo had last shared centuries in a stand back in 2018 at The Oval. This time, Pant made history by becoming the first Indian wicketkeeper — and only the fifth Indian batter — to score two hundreds in the same Test away from home.",Yashasvi Jaiswal drops fourth catch of the match.

As Shubman Gill stepped onto the field at Headingley, all eyes were on India’s new, youngest Test captain. At just 25, Gill was handed the reins at a time of transition — and immense expectation. However, his captaincy debut didn’t quite script a fairytale start. Despite India dominating large parts of the match, England’s remarkable chase of 371 handed Gill his first loss as skipper by five wickets. A promising first-innings century showed his intent with the bat, but the end result reminded everyone just how ruthless Test cricket can be for a young leader.Here’s a look back at how the previous 10 Indian Test captains before Gill began their journeys as leaders:Bumrah became the first fast bowler to captain India in Tests in decades. He picked up five wickets in the match, but England chased down 378 to win by seven wickets.Rohit began his captaincy tenure in style, leading India to an innings and 222-run victory. Though he scored only 29, it was a dominant team performance in his debut Test as skipper.Rahul scored a gritty 50 in the first innings but couldn’t stop India from slipping to a seven-wicket defeat.His brief stint as stand-in captain showed promise but lacked a result to match.Rahane led from the front with calm assurance, guiding India to a comfortable eight-wicket win. His knocks of 46 and an unbeaten 38* helped seal the series.Kohli’s captaincy debut was a memorable one. Taking charge in Adelaide, he scored centuries in both innings — 115 and 141 — and almost guided India to a dramatic win. Though India lost by 48 runs, Kohli made a powerful statement as leader and batter.Quiz: Who's that IPL player? Dhoni’s Test captaincy began with a win. He made 32 in his only innings and India chased down a small fourth-innings target with ease.India’s legendary spinner had a dream start as captain, taking 7 wickets in the match and helping India to a six-wicket win in a closely contested Test.Sehwag had a forgettable outing with the bat with scores of 20 and 0 — but India won by 259 runs, thanks to strong performances from others.Dravid’s captaincy debut ended in a draw. With the bat, he managed only 13 and 5, in a match dominated by New Zealand’s big first-innings total.Ganguly began with a commanding win against Bangladesh. He scored 84 and watched his side chase down a small target with ease, kickstarting a significant leadership era in Indian cricket.Shubman Gill’s first outing as India’s Test captain turned into a hard reality check as England pulled off a stunning chase of 371 runs to win the series opener by five wickets. Even though five Indian batters scored centuries, the team failed to capitalise when it mattered most. Missed catches, below-par outfielding and a lower-order collapse proved costly in the final moments.","India captain Shubman Gill made his Test captaincy debut against England.

NEW DELHI: England produced a brilliantly paced run chase to gun down a massive 371-run target and defeat India by five wickets in the series-opening Headingley Test on Tuesday — with 14 overs to spare. The hosts pulled off the 10th highest successful run chase in Test history with clinical execution and unwavering confidence, even on a fifth-day pitch that initially seemed to favour India’s bowlers, particularly in the morning and afternoon sessions.A commanding 188-run opening stand between Ben Duckett and Zak Crawley laid the foundation, wiping out more than half of the required runs. The final flourish came in style, as Jamie Smith sealed the win with a towering knee-down six over long-on.Reflecting on the performance, England captain Ben Stokes credited his side’s relentless intensity and the crucial role of the bowlers in cleaning up India's lower order.""It was all about our attitude and commitment, day in and day out. That’s what we focussed on. Both teams played quality cricket — a great way to start the series,"" Stokes said at the post-match press conference.""It was a very good wicket for batting. The way we knocked over the Indian tail was a big reason why we were able to chase down this score,"" he added.After a wicketless morning session, it was Prasidh Krishna and Shardul Thakur who unexpectedly provided India with breakthroughs in the afternoon. When Ravindra Jadeja dismissed Stokes after tea with 69 runs still needed, the tension briefly returned.However, Joe Root (53*) and Jamie Smith (44*) calmly guided England home, not allowing India even a glimmer of hope in the final stretch.With the win, England take a 1-0 lead in the five-match series. The second Test will be played at Edgbaston in Birmingham, starting July 2.""We're 1-0 up, but there are four more games. We'll celebrate and then quickly shift focus to Birmingham,"" Stokes said.The chase began under overcast skies with England resuming on 21/0, still needing 350 runs — a daunting task by any measure. But England once again proved their chasing prowess under the guidance of coach Brendon 'Baz' McCullum, notching their 12th successful pursuit in 18 attempts during his tenure.This wasn't the usual high-risk ""Bazball"" spectacle — it was a more measured and mature version of it. With a required run rate just under four per over, England managed the tempo smartly and stayed within that rate throughout.The contest also etched itself into the history books as only the third Test ever where all four innings crossed the 350-run mark. India posted 471 and 364, while England responded with 465 and 373/5 — a thrilling five-day battle that entertained from start to finish.","England produced a brilliantly paced run chase to gun down a massive 371-run target and defeat India by five wickets in the series-opening Headingley Test on Tuesday.

WV Raman backs Shubman Gill to fire in England: 'He needs the right support'

England scripted a remarkable five-wicket win over India in the first Test at Headingley on Tuesday, chasing down 371 in record-breaking fashion to take a 1-0 lead in the five-match Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy series. The hosts became the first team in over 60,000 first-class matches to concede five individual hundreds and still emerge victorious.Score: India vs England, 1st Test It was a day of milestones and heartbreaks. India posted a mammoth 835 runs across their two innings, with Rishabh Pant smashing centuries in both - only the second wicketkeeper in Test history to do so. Yet, collapses of 7 for 41 in the first innings and 6 for 31 in the second proved fatal, allowing England to stay in the hunt.Ben Duckett's blistering 149 set the tone, while Joe Root (53*) and debutant Jamie Smith (44*) polished off the chase with a calm, unbeaten 71-run stand. Smith fittingly sealed the win with a six, as England romped home at 373/5 in just 82 overs.India’s head coach Gautam Gambhir , however, chose to focus on the positives and refused to single out the bowling unit for blame.""We can’t question our bowlers after every Test.How will we groom them? We need to keep backing our players. We need to build a fast bowling battery,"" Gambhir said at the post-match press conference.He also pointed to India’s failure with the bat as the key reason for the loss. ""Best fielders in the world have dropped catches. Batting, yes, disappointing. We could have dominated had we scored over 600 in the first innings,"" he admitted.Despite Shardul Thakur’s late burst, which briefly brought India back into the game, Gambhir insisted the match was lost collectively: ""We just didn’t lose the Test because of our tail. We lose together, win together.""On Shubman Gill ’s leadership in his maiden Test as captain, Gambhir was emphatic in his support: ""First Test, there are always nerves. He was phenomenal… getting a hundred with the bat.

Poll Do you think India could have won the match if they had capitalized on key moments? Yes, they missed crucial opportunities. No, England played better overall.

Head down, Shubman Gill started that walk back to the change room with his team right behind him. Jamie Smith had clobbered Ravindra Jadeja for a maximum to seal the record chase, and give high-flying England a 1-0 lead over India in the Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy.Smith and Joe Root were greeted by their teammates with warm hugs and high-fives but there was disappointment written all over the visitors' change room. The match was littered with moments where India could have landed the knockout blow but the inexperienced side failed to get over the line on the day where all three results were possible.Tension, drama, plenty of plays-and-misses and the sun kept playing hide and seek with the dark grey clouds until the last hour of Day 5 at Headingley. England were five down, needing 52 runs but the visitors kept coming hard at them, especially after the Ben Stokes wicket which lifted their spirits. There weren't a lot of runs to play with but Shubman Gill & Co. operated with a lot of self-belief and waited for the miracle. Miracles the likes of a double-wicket over, a wicket-maiden or the big wicket of local hero Joe Root to put the hosts under the pump.In search of that moment, after an attempt with the combination of Prasidh Krishna and Ravindra Jadeja, Gill went back to Shardul Thakur - the man who brought them back into the game with the wickets of Ben Duckett and Harry Brook - but even he couldn't do the 'Lordly' things the world is used to seeing when the ball is in his hand.The stadium was nowhere close to a full house but the ones who braved the cold, chilly winds, rain and the infrequent sun were having the time of their life and found their voice when drama peaked in the business hour.Oohs, aahs, Jaiswal getting ironically cheered for fielding the ball cleanly - they were well warmed up in the stands as India desperately sought the miracle.Luck wasn't going their way either. Edges would run between the slips, Root would continue doing Root things when on strike - solid, calm and composed. Bringing all his experience into play, the right-hander ensured he was calm in the eye of the storm. Jasprit Bumrah 's brief absence from the 67th over would have eased their nerves further as England, unlike their opponents, were not going to stage a lower-order collapse.The new ball was around the corner but Root got all his experience into play to up the tempo and ensure mere formalities were left when the shining red cherry became available again. Only 22 were left to be scored and Mohammed Siraj was handed over the new ball. There, however, was no late twist in store and the ending which was expected after that solid first session played out.Never has a side which scored five individual hundreds in the Test lost a game before India did in Leeds on Tuesday. Even after dominating for the majority of the Test, the visitors, in a comfortable position before Day 5 got underway, didn't get the result in their favour. They had runs to play with, they had a Bumrah and support cast around him but England's phased response, led by Ben Duckett, didn't allow the opposition to make any inroads.When the ball was still hard and new and the sky above continued to be dark and grey, both Duckett and Crawley frustrated India with a 188-run stand and the only way to stage a comeback at that point was going to be with wickets in a bunch. That didn't happen and England kept the run-rate in check to further deflate the opposition. It was extremely difficult for Gill, on captaincy debut, to find that balance between defence and aggression as the hosts comfortably overhauled the target with five wickets in hand.There is still some time before the second Test gets underway in Birmingham and India need to regroup and re-strategise for that fixture. The right bowling combination is going to be key and they definitely need to find the answers for both life with and without Jasprit Bumrah.","Jamie Smith clobbered Ravindra Jadeja for a maximum to seal the record chase, and give high-flying England a 1-0 lead over India in the Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy.

India’s first Test of the five-match series against England ended in defeat at Headingley, and it brought with it a string of unwanted records for the Shubman Gill-led side, despite several sparkling individual performances.After setting a daunting target of 371 in the fourth innings, England overhauled it with remarkable composure, cruising to a five-wicket win after 82 overs on the final day. Ben Duckett’s sublime 149 set the tone, while Joe Root and Jamie Smith calmly steered the chase home.However, while England celebrated one of their finest modern-day fourth-innings chases, India’s unwanted records piled up.

This surpassed the previous record of four, set by Australia against England at the MCG way back in the 1928/29 Ashes.Pant’s pair of hundreds also made him only the second designated wicketkeeper to score centuries in both innings of a Test, joining Zimbabwe’s Andy Flower (2001).India’s batting effort across the two innings added up to 835 runs, making it the fourth-highest aggregate for a team in a losing cause in Test cricket Only England (861 vs Australia, Headingley 1948), Pakistan (847 vs England, Rawalpindi 2022), and New Zealand (837 vs England, Trent Bridge 2022) have scored more and still lost.For England, the 373-5 win over India is the second-largest target they chased in their history, only behind the 378-3 victory at Birmingham in 2022. Notably, two of England's biggest run chases have come in their last two home tests against India.This successful pursuit is also significant in terms of timing. It ranks as the second-largest target ever chased on the final scheduled day of a Test, behind only Don Bradman’s Australia (404 vs England at Leeds, 1948).As India look to regroup before the second Test begins on July 2, the records from Headingley will serve as an uncomfortable reminder that scoring big doesn't always necessitate results.","England beat India by five wickets in the first Test at Headingley.

Scorecard:

NEW DELHI: India skipper Shubman Gill admitted his team let key moments slip away after England pulled off a stirring five-wicket win in the first Test of the Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy series at Headingley on Tuesday.Chasing 371 for victory, the hosts rode on Ben Duckett’s scintillating 149 and a composed unbeaten 71-run stand between Joe Root (53*) and debutant Jamie Smith (44*) to overhaul the target in 82 overs.India had begun the final day with hope, reducing England to 299/5 after a wicketless morning session, but the bowlers couldn't break through again. Duckett’s fourth-innings masterclass and dropped chances in the field proved decisive.Speaking after the defeat, Gill did not mince words. ""A brilliant Test, we had our chances. Drop catches, lower order not contributing cost us,"" he said. ""Yesterday, we were thinking of giving them 430, but our last wickets fell for 25. Even today, I thought we had our chances after the brilliant first wicket. Didn't go to hand.""India’s batting collapses in both innings and missed fielding opportunities — most notably Yashasvi Jaiswal’s drop of Duckett on 98 — came back to haunt them.""We spoke about the first-innings collapse. Happens, but we have to rectify that going forward,"" Gill said. ""Chances don’t come easy on wickets like this, but we have a young, learning team.""Despite Jasprit Bumrah ’s fiery spells, India couldn’t sustain pressure. ""First session, we bowled spot-on. Didn't give away runs, but it's hard to stop runs once the ball gets old. Have to keep taking wickets then. Jadeja bowled brilliantly, created chances,"" Gill added. A missed chance off Jadeja also saw Rishabh Pant react late to a lobbed ball.England opener Duckett was named Player of the Match for his match-winning 149. ""Just an incredible game. At times, we were behind. Massive credit to our bowlers for bowling them out cheaply,"" Duckett said. ""If you add 50-60 more, it’s a different game. Limiting Bumrah’s impact was massive.""England captain Ben Stokes hailed the team’s attitude and execution. ""Awesome Test to be part of. Chasing a big total on day five is always special. Duckett’s stand with Crawley set us up brilliantly,"" he said.The second Test begins July 2 in Birmingham, with India needing a quick turnaround.",England beat India by five wickets in the first Test at Headingley. Ben Duckett's 149 and Joe Root's unbeaten 71 helped England reach 371. India skipper Shubman Gill admits his team let key moments slip away.

It turned out to be a historic outing for the Indian women’s national football team as they registered their biggest win ever in an official AFC match, hammering Mongolia 13-0 on Monday, June 23. The emphatic victory in Tashkent is now the Blue Tigresses’ fourth-largest winning margin in their history.Just six months ago, India had beaten the Maldives 14-0 in a friendly in Bengaluru, while their biggest-ever win remains the 18-0 demolition of Bhutan during the 2010 SAFF Championship in Cox’s Bazar.Monday’s win was not only a massive boost to their goal difference but also an early statement of intent in their bid to top the qualifying group and secure a spot for the AFC Women’s Asian Cup in Australia next year.Head coach Crispin Chettri, however, insisted his side can still be sharper in front of goal.Sometimes, you don’t have to look at shorelines. You need to move on. We just need to do our job, and that is to score goals. I know scoring is not always easy, no matter who the opponents are. At the same time, we must be more clinical and more professional and finish whatever chances come our way. We can be much better, I knowChettri said after the game.Despite a slightly sluggish start, India led 4-0 at half-time. On a slippery pitch, the floodgates opened in the second half. Pyari Xaxa was unstoppable, netting five of the first six goals, with Grace Dangmei setting up three of those and scoring the 12th herself from the penalty spot.Soumya Guguloth dazzled with her dribbles and a stunning left-footed volley, while Rimpa Haldar kept the Mongolian defence busy throughout. Second-half substitutes Malavika and Priyadharshini Selladurai capped off the scoring with their maiden goals for India.Looking ahead, Chettri said, “Our movement on the flanks was much better in the second half. We want more composure in midfield. We want more people to take shots from outside the box.

Poll Do you think North Korea's censorship of sports broadcasts is justified? Yes, it's their media No, it's unfair to athletes

Pyongyang’s Korean Central Television (KCTV) has once again demonstrated its strict media censorship by blurring South Korean footballer Lee Kang-in’s moment of glory during a delayed broadcast of the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup.The North Korean state broadcaster aired the match between Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) and Atlético Madrid five days after it was played at the Rose Bowl Stadium in Los Angeles last Sunday. With PSG leading 3–0 deep into stoppage time, Atlético conceded a handball, handing Lee a penalty in the 97th minute, which he converted for his first goal in the tournament. But North Korean viewers could only see an 'altered' version of the same. KCTV pixelated Lee’s face and number during the penalty and merely stated that PSG defeated Atlético Madrid, avoiding any mention of the South Korean midfielder’s name.This selective editing aligns with Pyongyang’s long-running practice of erasing South Korean sporting achievements from broadcasts. KCTV typically airs sports matches an hour or two before its evening news at 5 p.m., frequently showing Premier League and Champions League games involving top European clubs.But matches featuring South Korean stars like Tottenham’s Son Heung-min, Wolverhampton’s Hwang Hee-chan, or Lee Kang-in himself are either heavily censored or omitted altogether.The regime’s ruling Workers' Party dictates all televised content, and football is no exception. The authorities have consistently refused to show South Korean flags and have gone so far as to refer to the national team as a “puppet South Korean team.” KCTV even pixelated the flag during broadcasts of the 2022 FIFA World Cup and the AFC U-17 Women’s Asian Cup last year.Six months into the 2024/25 Premier League season, KCTV began airing matches in January — but with what US-based website 38 North described as “heavy-handed intervention” from Pyongyang’s censors. This means any clubs with prominent South Korean players are practically off-limits for broadcast, a source of frustration for North Korean football fans who might secretly admire players like Son or Hwang.",South Korean footballer Lee Kang-in's moment of glory was blurred out during broadcast of 2025 FIFA Club World Cup.

Yildiz stars for Juventus

Rudiger complains of racist insult

Manchester City hit Al Ain for six on Sunday to secure a place in the last 16 of the Club World Cup after Real Madrid shrugged off an early red card to beat Mexican side Pachuca 3-1.Juventus proved too strong for Wydad Casablanca while Red Bull Salzburg and Al Hilal drew 0-0 as the second round of group games at the tournament came to a conclusion.The match between City and Al Ain in Atlanta was dubbed the ""Abu derby"", with the English club's owner and United Arab Emirates vice-president Sheikh Mansour facing off against his elder sibling, Sheikh Mohamed, president of the Emirati team and also the country.Ilkay Gundogan put City ahead early on before 19-year-old Claudio Echeverri netted his first goal for the club with a free-kick and Erland Haaland slotted in the third with a penalty in first-half stoppage time.In the second half, Gundogan struck again before two substitutes joined in, with Oscar Bobb rolling in the fifth and Rayan Cherki grabbing his first City goal for 6-0.The result, in a game watched by a crowd of over 40,000, means both City and Juventus are through to the knockout phase after each winning their first two matches in Group G.hey will now face each other in Orlando on Thursday to decide who tops the section.""Now we have to see whether we'll be first or second in the group,"" said City coach Pep Guardiola, who changed his entire starting line-up following the 2-0 opening win against Wydad.""We played a little bit better than the first game, especially in the second half.""Juventus triumphed 4-1 against Moroccan giants Wydad in Philadelphia, as Kenan Yildiz played a starring role.The Turkish international forward scored twice after forcing the early own goal which put Juve ahead in front of almost 32,000 at Lincoln Financial Field.His shot found the net with the aid of a slight but crucial deflection off Abdelmounaim Boutouil, and Yildiz then smashed in the second on 16 minutes with a brilliant half-volley.South African winger Thembinkosi Lorch pulled one back for Wydad, but the impressive Yildiz made it 3-1 midway through the second half and Dusan Vlahovic converted a penalty in injury time to seal the win for Igor Tudor's side.""He has great potential,"" Tudor told broadcaster DAZN when asked about Yildiz. ""A wonderful player, so there is a big future in front of him.""In Charlotte, Real Madrid overcame the early sending-off of Raul Asencio to beat Pachuca and get their first win under new coach Xabi Alonso.Defender Asencio was dismissed after just seven minutes for pulling down Salomon Rondon with the Venezuelan clear on goal.That left the Liga MX team sensing the chance for an upset in front of 70,248 fans at the home of the NFL's Carolina Panthers.However, Real took the lead on 35 minutes when Jude Bellingham buried a left-foot shot into the bottom corner, and they scored again before the interval through Arda Guler.Fede Valverde got their third in the second half, with a deflected Elias Montiel effort pulling one back for Pachuca.Alonso praised the way his team handled the early sending-off.""It became really intense for us, but we defended with a lot of sacrifice and solidarity, which is what it takes,"" he said.Alonso also said that Real defender Antonio Rudiger had complained of a racist incident at the end of the game when the German was visibly angered following an exchange of words with Pachuca's Gustavo Cabral.""I think the FIFA protocol has been activated to investigate, but if it has happened, all measures should be taken and we support Antonio because it's something unacceptable,"" said the coach.Cabral, the 39-year-old Argentinian centre-back, denied the accusations, saying his words had been misinterpreted.Real are level at the top of Group H on four points with Salzburg, who drew 0-0 with Al Hilal in Washington, DC.Madrid and Salzburg meet each other next in Philadelphia, while Al Hilal have two points and can still qualify with a win when they play Pachuca, who are now out.",Manchester City beat Al Ain 6-0 in the FIFA Club World Cup.

Liverpool’s biggest-ever transfer! Florian Wirtz joins Premier League club from Bayer Leverkusen in stunning record deal,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/top-stories/liverpools-biggest-ever-transfer-florian-wirtz-joins-premier-league-club-from-bayer-leverkusen-in-stunning-record-deal/articleshow/121985525.cms,"Leverkusen's Florian Wirtz (AP Photo)

Florian Wirtz has joined Liverpool from Bayer Leverkusen for a club-record fee, following the Reds' 20th English top-flight title victory under Arne Slot. Former Liverpool midfielder and Wirtz's ex-coach Xabi Alonso has already recognised him as one of the world's best players.British media has reported that Liverpool will pay up to £116 million ($157 million) for the attacking midfielder. German sources suggest an even higher fee, beginning at 130 million euros (£111 million, $149 million) with potential add-ons reaching 150 million euros.A dispute arose between Cologne and Leverkusen five years ago when Leverkusen signed the teenage Wirtz at age 17. Cologne claimed a gentleman's agreement regarding youth players was broken, but Leverkusen maintained Wirtz was a first-team signing.Wirtz's progress was halted by a cruciate knee ligament injury in March 2022, keeping him sidelined for 10 months. Upon his return, he found Alonso as the new Leverkusen manager, leading to the club's most successful period.Under their partnership, Leverkusen ended Bayern Munich's Bundesliga dominance, securing both the league title and German Cup without losing a match in 2023/24. Wirtz celebrated the title-clinching match against Werder Bremen with his first career hat-trick, later earning the Bundesliga player of the year award.""Flo is one of the top players in the world, he's world class,"" said Real Madrid coach Alonso, who compared his protégé to Lionel Messi in terms of his understanding of the game.""Why is Messi so good? Because he knows how and when to play simple passes. Messi says: 'You're in a better position? Here, there you have the ball'. It's not always about making the most brilliant move, but the best and smartest. Florian can do that. That's why he's so good.""Both Wirtz and Alonso initially committed to staying at Leverkusen for another year. However, their Europa League final loss to Atalanta in 2023/24 marked a turning point.Bayern Munich regained control of German football the following season but failed to convince Wirtz to join them. Instead, he chose to move to the Premier League champions.""I'm really excited to have a new adventure in front of me.

His fans obviously loved the video shared by Porsche on its official Instagram handle.Porsche has shared a short, fun video featuring Antonio Felix Da Costa’s race routine on Instagram with the caption: “Race day with António – stay close or stay back.”The video starts with Da Costa waking up at 6:29 a.m. for media day and cruising to the circuit, as it was a casual Monday. There’s then a glimpse of the garage, which smells like “focused rubber and podium energy.” He even has his own name for media day, which he calls “Smile until your face hurts.”It’s also revealed that Da Costa sits with the engineers to understand the data – and he actually gets it. As he suits up in his race gear, it’s said to be “30 percent style and 70 percent sweat.” The video also offers a close look at his Porsche electric car, which he races in the Formula E Grand Prix this season.His fans loved the fun video and called it “awesome”. One fan wrote, “Cool guy, super driver!” Another reacted, “That's our Antonio!” with fire and heart emojis. A third fan wrote in Portuguese (translated to English), “The purest reality!

Sergio Aguero takes on the race track in a GEN3 Evo



All about GEN3 Evo Sessions

Manchester City star Sergio Aguero is one of the few chosen ones to get a chance to drive a Formula E car on a race track. The footballer had his own GEN3 Evo session, guided by none other than TAG Heuer Porsche driver Pascal Wehrlein. And Aguero nailed it by driving the electric race car like a pro, although he missed his engineer’s message to slow down to cool the tyres.Sergio Aguero got the opportunity to drive the Porsche 99X Electric GEN3 Evo Formula E car during Miami’s Evo Sessions on March 5 and 6. The video from his Evo session is pure entertainment, as he takes lap after lap, clearly enjoying the thrill of driving a race car.Earlier, the official handle of FIA Formula E shared a video from Sergio’s Evo Session on Instagram. It showed how the footballer missed the messages to slow down and continued at high speed despite the need to cool the tyres. He later asked them to raise the volume and eventually slowed down. Pascal Wehrlein was seen doing a great job coaching him over the radio.The 37-year-old told Formulae.com about the opportunity, “This is absolutely crazy: from footballer to racing driver in one of the fastest racing cars in the world.Every child is familiar with Porsche. The brand represents an iconic heritage, particularly in motorsport. I am absolutely delighted and would like to thank everyone involved for this unique opportunity.”Aguero and other participants underwent detailed training, which included simulator sessions, physical conditioning, driver coaching, hardware customization, and engineering briefings. It not only gave them the thrill of driving a race car but also gave viewers insight into the intricate world of Formula E — how a driver is trained and how the car is driven during a race. A complete documentary will be released later this year, showcasing the entire Evo Sessions footage.Sharing his reaction when Formula E CEO Jeff Dodds first presented the idea, he said, “The initial reaction when I presented the concept of ‘Evo Sessions’ to our teams and partners was, ‘This is wild!’ — which is when I immediately knew we had to bring it to life. We wanted to do something that has never been done before in motorsport; something that would give audiences and our fan base a unique perspective into the world of a Formula E driver, through the eyes of some of their favourite online personalities. ”He added, “Formula E is the fastest-growing motorsport in the world, and we have a clear target to hit half a billion fans by 2030. Through collaborating with some of the biggest names in popular culture right now, we’re able to open up Formula E to a whole new fanbase.”Also Read: Pascal Wehrlein on second place in Shanghai: “First time I felt like we were very competitive in the wet” Even the trainers are among the best Formula E drivers in the world.

Edoardo Mortara on his second place finish in Jakarta

Edoardo Mortara on being part of Mahindra Racing



Formula E Season 11 has turned out well for most teams, with new podium winners emerging in each round. At the recently held Jakarta E-Prix, it was Mahindra Racing’s Edoardo Mortara who secured his first podium of the season and the team’s second. While he’s happy to have claimed second place in Jakarta, he feels they could have achieved even more. His teammate, Nyck De Vries, was handed a ten-second time penalty for colliding with Jake Dennis as they approached the finish line.Edoardo Mortara joined Mahindra Racing in 2023 and had been chasing a podium finish ever since. Speaking after securing second place at the Jakarta E-Prix, the 38-year-old said, “I’m feeling kind of disappointed for the team because I think that more was possible for us, but actually happy for me. It’s been a long time coming, this podium, and if I look back, there were several occasions where, with a bit more luck, we could have changed it. ”Mortara found his podium opportunity when both his teammate Nyck De Vries and Andretti’s Jake Dennis were removed from contention after their collision. “But nevertheless, super happy with today’s race. I think we managed the strategy pretty well, especially with the first Attack Mode.We got a little bit unlucky with the Safety Car and Full Course Yellow because I think I could have made good use of my Attack Mode and passed Dan [Ticktum]. I was in front of him before the second Attack Mode. Nevertheless, super happy with second place and already looking forward to the next one,” he said.However, Mortara regrets that Jakarta isn't a double-header this year, unlike its last edition in 2023. ""Right from the start of the year, we're showing more and more performance, and this weekend we were really, really good. It's a shame that we only have one race here. I would have hoped to have a second one,"" he told FormulaE.com in an interview.Now running high on confidence, Mortara aims to continue the momentum in the upcoming Berlin double-header. He has achieved multiple podiums in Berlin in previous years, including one win.Reflecting on Mahindra Racing’s significant improvement this season, Mortara said, ""This year has been crucial for us. We brought some big updates in terms of software that helped us close a bit of the gap with the front-runners. I feel that now we have a package that is capable — not always, but on certain race weekends — of challenging at the front, and we probably had the best package in the race. Nevertheless, this result (Jakarta) shows great promise for the final race weekends, especially Berlin, which has always been a good one for me.

How Formula E is making an impact in Jakarta

Jakarta Race Promo: Heat, Grit & Gen3 Evo on Street Wheels | Formula E S11 R12

Formula E is not only introducing the fastest electric car, the GEN3 Evo, at the Jakarta E-Prix this year but also making an impact off the track. Several Formula E members participated in a beach clean-up on Thursday at Pantai Beach in the Ancol resort, where the race will be held. They are also engaging in local partnerships, educational initiatives, and community outreach to help reduce the environmental impact in the city.On Thursday, June 19, Formula E, Waste4Change, and over 100 volunteers—including FE team members and drivers—joined local community members for a large-scale beach clean-up. The initiative focused on conserving marine habitats and addressing waste management, a key issue in coastal Jakarta.Julia Pallé, VP of Sustainability at Formula E, said about the drive: “Plastic pollution is a growing problem that affects everyone around the world and is a growing challenge here in Jakarta — threatening both coastal habitats and the health of nearby communities. At every race, we are committed to engaging with local communities and aim to leave a place better than we found it. We are united as a championship with the community to clean the local area of plastic rubbish and ensure it is sustainably managed and not put back into landfill.To further minimize waste at the event, free hydration stations will provide water refills to reduce reliance on single-use plastic bottles. Visitors will also receive biodegradable eco-cups made from corn starch flour as an alternative to traditional plastic. Six dedicated waste stations will be set up for proper recycling and plastic waste management.Formula E has undertaken several more sustainability initiatives in Jakarta. A Formula E delegation visited the Waste4Change recycling center on Tuesday to learn about effective waste management practices and the role of the circular economy in conserving resources.On Wednesday, a school visit featured a panel talk on environmental education and youth leadership, along with art and cultural exchanges between students and Formula E members.Following the race, a paddock plant donation is scheduled. Trees and plants used during the event will be donated to local schools. After the race on Saturday, Formula E will host a ceremony on-site with local school students to mark the donation.Also Read: Jakarta E-Prix 2025: Schedule, how to watch Round 12 Formula E race, weather prediction In addition, Formula E’s Better Futures Fund is providing a €25,000 donation to Yayasan Perempuan dan Anak Amirah. The “Climateability: From the Margins to the Frontlines” project aims to empower women, people with disabilities, and youth groups most vulnerable to climate impacts. It will include inclusive leadership workshops, digital storytelling, training, and the development of a Climate Sign Language Glossary in Bisindo.","Formula E members participated in a beach clean-up on Thursday at Pantai Beach in the Ancol resort, where the race will be held.

Jakarta E‑Prix Essentials: Everything You Need to Know | Formula E Season 11, Round 12

Season 11 of the ABB FIA Formula E World Championship is coming to a close, with five races remaining on the calendar. The Jakarta E-Prix is a crucial race, and it's hard to predict who may lift the trophy in Indonesia this year. The current season has already seen seven different race winners and fifteen drivers on the podium. Not only that, but every single team has achieved a podium finish so far — a clear indication of how tight and unpredictable the competition is.Nissan's Oliver Rowland is far ahead of the competition so far, as he dominates the FIA Drivers' World Championship standings with 171 points — significantly ahead of Pascal Wehrlein, who sits in second position with 103 points for TAG Heuer Porsche. Rowland has a total of four wins and three second-place finishes this season, and he may continue his winning streak in Jakarta as well.Maserati MSG Racing’s Maximilian Gunther is being counted among the hot favourites to bag a podium at the Jakarta E-Prix. He has two wins under his belt this year and will be trying his best to maintain his stronghold in the city and add more points to his tally.He had secured third place in the Part 1 race in 2023, having started from Julius Bar Pole Position — a historic moment as Maserati's first single-seater motorsport pole since 1958.He again bagged the pole the next day of the double-header and went on to win his first race in the iconic blue livery of Maserati MSG Racing. It marked Maserati’s first single-seater championship podium since Juan Manuel Fangio's 1957 German Grand Prix victory, en route to that year’s Formula One title.Pascal Wehrlein won one of the two races at the Jakarta E-Prix’s last edition, and the TAG Heuer Porsche driver is very much in form at present, with a win in Miami and three more podium finishes in the Formula E 2025 World Championship so far. He is second in the 2025 Formula E Driver Standings with 103 points and will be aiming for a win to catch up with Rowland.Jaguar TCS Racing’s Mitch Evans has been away from the podium for a long time now after winning the first race of this season in Sao Paulo. But this could also indicate his growing hunger for a win — or at least another podium — possibly in Jakarta, before the season comes to a close. Evans had won the first edition of the Jakarta E-Prix in 2022, when three drivers crossed the line within a single second. The other two drivers were Jean-Éric Vergne and Edoardo Mortara, who took second and third positions in that Season 8 race.He also bagged the third spot on the podium in Race 2 of the Jakarta double-header in 2023. This makes him one of the strong contenders to make a comeback on the podium.Also Read: Jakarta E-Prix 2025: Schedule, how to watch Round 12 Formula E race, weather prediction Since Nick Cassidy and Sebastien Buemi have also ended their race droughts this year, one can expect a new winner in Jakarta as well. The E-Prix begins on Friday with the free practice session and will conclude on Saturday with the final race in the early evening. The heat is on — but rain is likely, and that’s enough to add to the unpredictability factor.","Season 11 of the ABB FIA Formula E World Championship is coming to a close.

'I had so much hate'

London: Carlos Alcaraz warned his Wimbledon rivals that he ""feels great"" on grass after the world number two defied his own expectations by winning the Queen's Club title for a second time.Alcaraz battled to a bruising 7-5, 6-7 (5/7), 6-2 victory over Czech world number 30 Jiri Lehecka in the final of the Wimbledon warm-up event on Sunday.The 22-year-old has extended his career-best winning streak to 18 matches, putting him in the perfect position to defend his Wimbledon title.Alcaraz has won the French Open, the Rome Masters and Queen's during his blistering run.But the five-time Grand Slam champion had arrived in west London concerned about his ability to make the tricky transition from the clay-court season to the unique demands of the brief grass campaign.Underling the difficulty of the task, Alcaraz is the first player to win Roland Garros and Queen's back to back since Rafael Nadal in 2008.""I'm going to say it's really complicated, the switch from clay to grass in just few days, because that's the time I had before the tournament began, just two days of practising,"" Alcaraz said.""So I came here with no expectations at all. I came here with a goal to play two or three matches, try to feel great on grass, and give myself the feedback of what I have to improve.""But I got used to the grass really quick, and I'm really proud about it. My goal was complete, and I'm not talking about lifting the trophy or making the final.""It was just to feel great, to feel really comfortable on grass once again.""For a player raised on the clay courts of Spain, Alcaraz has become a formidable force on the lawns of Queen's and Wimbledon.He is only the third Spanish man to win four grass-court tournaments after Nadal and Feliciano Lopez.""It's great to be with Rafa and Feli, such great players from our country,"" he said.""Hopefully now I will not stop here. Hopefully keep going.""A key part of Alcaraz's winning formula is his ability to switch off from tennis after tournaments to ensure he is refreshed when he returns to the court.The former world number one partied in Ibiza after his epic five-set French Open final triumph against Jannik Sinner earlier this month.He won't have time for a similar holiday before Wimbledon starts on June 30, but he plans to relax as much as possible in London before focusing on his bid for a third successive All England Club crown.""A lot of people ask me the same question: Are you going to go back to Ibiza? I wish! As I said, I'm a player who needs days off to enjoy, days for myself to spend with my friends, with my family, just to turn off my mind,"" he said.""I can't go back home. I'm going to stay here in London, hopefully enjoy it a little bit, then be back and preparing Wimbledon the best way possible.""While Sinner crashed out in the Halle second round against Alexander Bublik this week, Alcaraz's success at Queen's moved his record since losing to David Goffin at the Miami Masters in March to a formidable 27-1.Alcaraz believes that defeat was a transformative moment in his season.""I had so much hate when I lost in Miami. A lot of people started to say 'What's going on with this guy. He just lost in the first round, and he didn't practice, he didn't go to the court',"" Alcaraz said.""I think that was the key, just to have five, six days off, not grabbing a racquet, not stepping on the court. Just go to vacation with my family, to turn off my mind, to think what should I have done better?""I just got the joy back. I started to enjoy playing tennis again, realising what is the most important thing for me.""","Carlos Alcaraz wins Queen's Club title for second time. Beats Jiri Lehecka 7-5, 6-7 (5/7), 6-2 in the final on Sunday. World number two extends his winning streak to 18 matches. He is the first player to win Roland Garros and Queen's back to back since Rafael Nadal.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122014918,imgsize-66630,width-400,resizemode-4/122014918.jpg"

- Ruthless Alcaraz -

L ONDON: Carlos Alcaraz clinched his second Queen's Club title as the world number two warmed up for Wimbledon with a 7-5, 6-7 (5/7), 6-2 win against Jiri Lehecka in Sunday's final. Alcaraz blasted 33 winners and 18 aces to subdue the gritty Czech world number 30 in two hours and 10 minutes in west London.Having won titles on clay at the French Open, Rome and Monte Carlo, as well as the hard courts of Rotterdam, Alcaraz has now collected five trophies in 2025.The 22-year-old has not lost since the Barcelona final against Holger Rune on April 20 and is enjoying the longest winning streak of his career with 18 successive victories.Top seeded Alcaraz is just the second Spanish man to win Queen's twice after Feliciano Lopez, who lifted the trophy in 2017 and 2019.""I'm happy to lift this trophy once again. It's a nightmare to play against Jiri, but it's been an incredible week,"" Alcaraz said.""I came without expectations. I just wanted to play good tennis and get used to the grass.""It's really special playing here every year. I can't wait to come back next year.""For a player raised on the clay courts of Spain, Alcaraz has developed into a formidable force on grass.The former world number one signalled his emergence on the surface by winning Queen's in 2023.He clinched the Wimbledon title for the first time just weeks later and defended his All England Club crown last year.Alcaraz, who has an 11-1 career record at Queen's, will start his bid for a third successive Wimbledon title on June 30.After his semi-final win over Roberto Bautista Agut on Saturday, Alcaraz fired an ominous message to his Wimbledon rivals, warning that his ""grass-court mode"" had been activated.And on the evidence of his relentless display against the obdurate Lehecka, he is in no mood to surrender his All England Club crown.Playing his first tournament since his epic French Open victory against Jannik Sinner two weeks ago, Alcaraz's march to the Queen's showpiece made it five consecutive finals for the Spaniard.In contrast, Lehecka was playing in his first grass-court final after a shock win against British star Jack Draper in the last four.The 23-year-old was the first Czech in the Queen's final since Ivan Lendl in 1990.Lehecka had come from a set down to stun Alcaraz in the Qatar Open quarter-finals in February.But there would be no repeat of that upset on the lawns of Barons Court.In his second Queen's final, Alcaraz had an early chance to break in the fifth game of the first set.Lehecka thundered down an ace to get out of trouble of that occasion.But the five-time Grand Slam champion matched Lehecka's serve blow for blow, dropping just one point in his first four service games.Alcaraz's piercing ground-strokes increased the pressure and Lehecka finally cracked in the the 11th game when an badly-timed double-fault gifted the first break to the Spaniard.Alcaraz served out the set in typically ruthless fashion, but Lehecka refused to surrender without a fight.A tight second set stayed on serve all the way through to the tie-break and, for once, Alcaraz stumbled with a key double-fault, allowing Lehecka to level the match.Alcaraz was unfazed, breaking for a 3-1 lead in the deciding set when Lehecka netted an off-balance forehand.Alcaraz had the finish line in sight and he wrapped up his latest title triumph with a flurry of searing winners.","Carlos Alcaraz beats Jiri Lehecka 7-5, 6-7 (5/7), 6-2 to win Queen's Club title. World number two is just the second Spanish man to win the tournament twice. The 22-year-old has not lost since the Barcelona final on April 20. He is enjoying the longest winning streak of his career with 18 successive victories.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122008446,imgsize-62112,width-400,resizemode-4/122008446.jpg"

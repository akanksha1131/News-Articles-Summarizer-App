NEW DELHI: Social media was abuzz with criticism after India's shocking four-run capitulation against England in their Women’s World Cup 2025 group-stage match. The hosts meekly surrendered despite needing 36 runs off 30 balls with six wickets in hand, crumbling to an all-too-familiar choke against Nat Sciver-Brunt’s side. The defeat brought back unpleasant memories of India’s loss in the 2017 World Cup final against the same opposition, where they lost their last seven wickets for 28 runs in 6.5 overs.Experts questioned the lack of intent, highlighting it as a major concern in case of a high-pressure face-off against big-hitting sides like Australia during the tournament’s knockouts. In stepped Richa Ghosh just when the Indian team needed a game-changer — during the semifinal against Australia and the final against South Africa — smashing the ball fearlessly on the biggest stage. The 22-year-old wicketkeeper-batter struck 26 off 16 balls in the semifinal, a knock comprising two fours and two sixes, helping the hosts gain a sizeable edge while chasing 339. Richa further stepped up in the final when the team needed big hits following the dismissals of Shafali Verma and Harmanpreet Kaur, scoring 34 off 24 balls, which included three fours and two sixes.While the Bengal cricketer’s heroics were on full display, what made the feats even more impressive was the pain barrier she pushed through to perform for the national team.Richa battled through a hairline fracture in the middle finger of her left hand, as revealed by Bengal fast-bowling coach Shib Shankar Paul, who has coached her since the age of 13.""Richa suffered a broken finger but smashed massive sixes despite that, which showcases her willpower. I told her, 'Don't get scared. All pain will go away, but the World Cup cannot get away from our grasp. Come back after winning the tournament.' She responded, 'Yes, I have lost out on an opportunity to win the World Cup in 2022. I have to pull it off this time,’"" said Paul in an exclusive interaction with TimesofIndia.com.Richa scored 235 runs in eight innings at an average of 39.16 during the recently concluded World Cup, with a strike rate of 133.52 — the highest in the tournament. The Bengal cricketer also led the way in hitting sixes, smashing 12 of them. Richa’s high-impact gameplay especially shone through in the group-stage match against eventual finalists South Africa, where she scored 94 off 77 balls in a knock comprising 11 fours and four sixes. This success has been the result of a fearless yet structured training programme, built on immense discipline and dietary control.""Richa started off as a big-hitting opener, but I told her to bat at number five and finish matches. She bats from morning till evening daily, facing 100–150 balls of each shot with a specific focus on power-hitting. The training sessions are conducted with boys. Richa doesn’t wear a thigh pad even if I ask her to, and she won’t leave the field despite an injury. She once hit a six during practice that shattered a car’s glass. I told the owner, 'Take a picture with her. You can share this incident after Richa helps India win the World Cup,’"" said Paul.Richa’s significant success has also stemmed from improved mental clarity about which deliveries to capitalise on. Her Siliguri-based former coach, Gopal Saha, highlighted a conversation following a T20 match that transformed her approach to shot selection. ""I told her to respect the good deliveries rather than attempting to hit every ball for a six. That conversation changed her mindset, making her more watchful while facing deliveries,"" said Saha.The 22-year-old big-hitting wicketkeeper-batter idolises MS Dhoni and has interacted with the legendary cricketer a few times. Former India captain Sourav Ganguly also guides Richa, urging Paul to focus on her fitness levels.""She is very particular about her diet and has stopped eating chocolates and outside food. Richa’s fitness levels have improved a lot. There’s a specific cook who prepares chicken when she comes for training sessions and avoids rice. Richa’s only indulgence is drinking tea. Being part of the Indian team has been a major game-changer in her fitness journey, providing clarity on the high standards necessary to stay in contention. Richa has faced a lot of struggle over the years, travelling from Siliguri to Kolkata frequently for practice sessions, despite coming from a financially modest family. Her ultimate goal is to play three more World Cups — which is definitely achievable,"" stated Paul.","Richa Ghosh scored 235 runs in eight innings at an average of 39.16 during the recently concluded World Cup.

'South Africa kept fighting, deserved champions': Pat Cummins

Australian cricket captain Pat Cummins , who has been sidelined with a lower back injury for over three months, indicated on Thursday he might return for the second Ashes Test against England, following the team's squad announcement for the series opener in Perth.The 32-year-old pace bowler has been out of action since sustaining an injury during a match against the West Indies.""It's all feeling really good. On track and yeah, probably better than I expected,"" Cummins told journalists.""Each session is incremental. Once I get over to Perth, I should be pretty close to a full run-up and getting some overs in,"" he said.""It's probably not until you get a bit closer that you can really know where you're at,"" Cummins added, noting that ""It's trying to keep that second Test as a real live option"" for the day-night contest in Brisbane on December 4.Local television cameras recently captured Cummins bowling with a five-step run-up during a brief net session in Sydney, sparking speculation about his return.Cummins will travel with the Australian team to Perth for the first Test starting November 21, where Steve Smith will serve as captain.

Australia has named uncapped opener Jake Weatherald in their 15-man squad for the first Ashes Test against England, along with Brendan Doggett and Sean Abbott as backup fast bowlers. The squad announcement came on Wednesday in Sydney, with Steve Smith set to captain in place of injured Pat Cummins for the series opener in Perth on November 21.The 31-year-old Weatherald could become Usman Khawaja's sixth opening partner since David Warner's retirement last year, following unsuccessful trials with Steve Smith, Nathan McSweeney, Sam Konstas, Travis Head, and Marnus Labuschagne.Chief selector George Bailey has not confirmed Weatherald's place in the starting eleven. ""No, not confirmed in the XI. Obviously we've got 14 of our 15-man squad playing round four (of the Sheffield Shield). Still some information to gather out of that. Cameron Green, being one, returning to the bowling crease, that'd be good,"" Bailey said.Cameron Green's bowling fitness remains a key consideration, having only bowled minimal overs since returning from back surgery 13 months ago.If Green can bowl sufficient overs, he will likely bat at number six, with Weatherald opening and Labuschagne at number three.The team might alternatively position Labuschagne to open with Khawaja, moving Green to number three and Beau Webster to sixth position if Green's bowling remains limited.""We are looking forward to the squad connecting and preparing in Perth leading on from a busy domestic and white ball schedule to kick off the Test summer,"" Bailey added.Regular captain Pat Cummins, who has been sidelined with a lower back injury since facing the West Indies, will travel with the squad to Perth and aims to return for the day-night second Test in Brisbane from December 4.Scott Boland will lead the pace attack alongside Mitchell Starc and Josh Hazlewood in Cummins' absence.Spinner Nathan Lyon enters his 140th Test needing just two wickets to surpass Glenn McGrath and become the sixth-highest wicket-taker in Test history.The five-Test series will proceed from Perth to Brisbane, Adelaide, Melbourne, and Sydney.England, who managed a 2-2 draw in the 2023 home Ashes series, haven't won in Australia since 2010-2011.The Australian squad consists of Steve Smith (captain), Sean Abbott, Scott Boland, Alex Carey, Brendan Doggett, Cameron Green, Josh Hazlewood, Travis Head, Josh Inglis, Usman Khawaja, Marnus Labuschagne, Nathan Lyon, Mitchell Starc, Jake Weatherald, and Beau Webster.",Jake Weatherald named in Australia's 15-man squad for first Ashes Test against England.

Pratika Rawal Father Interview: On daughter's hundred, the World Cup dream and more

Pratika Rawal may not have played the final stages of the Women’s World Cup 2025, but her contribution to India’s historic triumph remains unforgettable. The 25-year-old batter finished as the team’s second-highest run-scorer despite missing the knockout games, yet she did not receive a winner’s medal due to ICC rules.Rawal’s World Cup campaign came to a heartbreaking halt after she injured her ankle during India’s group-stage clash against Bangladesh. Before that setback, she had scored 308 runs in six innings at an impressive average of 51.33, including several crucial knocks that helped India reach the semifinals. However, her injury forced the team management to bring in Shafali Verma as a replacement.Also Watch:According to ICC regulations, medals are awarded only to players in the final 15-member squad. Since Rawal was replaced before the semifinal, she missed out on the winner’s medal, even though her runs were instrumental in setting up India’s title charge. Interestingly, the same situation occurred in the 2003 Men’s World Cup when Australia’s Jason Gillespie, despite taking eight wickets in four games, was replaced after an injury and did not receive a medal.On Sunday night, as India defeated South Africa by 52 runs at the DY Patil Stadium to lift their maiden Women’s ODI World Cup trophy, Rawal watched the scenes unfold from the sidelines.Sitting in her wheelchair, wrapped in the Indian flag, she could not hold back her tears.“I can’t even express it. There are no words. This flag on my shoulder means so much. To be here with my team — it’s surreal. Injuries are part of the game, but I’m just so happy I could still be part of this team. I love this team. I can’t express what I feel — we actually did it! We’re the first Indian team to win the World Cup in so long. The whole of India deserves this,” she said emotionally.For Rawal, the moment was bittersweet. She could not take the field in the final, but as Shafali Verma’s blistering 87 guided India to victory, she celebrated every boundary and wicket with the same passion as her teammates.“Honestly, it was harder to watch than to play. Every wicket, every boundary — it gave me goosebumps. The energy, the crowd, the emotion — it was incredible,” she said.Her story stands as a reminder that sometimes heroes of a championship do not always stand on the podium, but their impact is deeply felt in every cheer, every run, and every dream fulfilled.",Pratika Rawal scored 308 runs in six innings at an impressive average of 51.33.

BCCI sends a stern message to Mohsin Naqvi over Asia Cup trophy row

Once hailed as Pakistan ’s modern batting genius, Babar Azam is fast running out of excuses. The right-hander’s struggles continued in Faisalabad, where he scored just 7 runs in the first ODI against South Africa — extending his century drought to 80 international innings.For a player who was once compared to Virat Kohli , Babar’s recent record paints a worrying picture. Since his last international hundred — against Nepal in the 2023 Asia Cup — he has failed to cross three figures even once across formats. In his last 30 ODI innings, Babar has managed only 945 runs at an average of 35.00 and a strike rate of 78.55, with a highest score of just 78.Despite these underwhelming numbers, surprisingly Babar still sits fourth in the ICC ODI batting rankings. His inability to deliver match-winning knocks in recent months has sparked debate among fans and critics alike about whether he still deserves to be called Pakistan’s premier batter.The Faisalabad crowd, eager to see their hometown hero rediscover his touch, was left disappointed as he fell cheaply once again. While Pakistan went on to clinch a two-wicket win in a tense finish, thanks to Naseem Shah’s final-over single, Babar’s failure overshadowed much of the post-match celebrations.South Africa, batting first, posted 263 courtesy of Quinton de Kock (63) and debutant Lhuan-dre Pretorius (57). Pakistan’s bowlers, led by Abrar Ahmed (3-53) and Naseem Shah (3-40), did the job, but their captain’s batting continues to be a major concern.With two matches left in the series, pressure is mounting on Babar Azam. Unless he finds a way to end this alarming run, Pakistan’s supposed batting king might soon find his crown slipping.",Babar Azam has failed to score a century in 80 international innings.

Former India all-rounder Yuvraj Singh has drawn comparisons between his own playing days and the rise of young left-hander Abhishek Sharma , praising the support system that allows the youngster to bat with freedom and aggression.Speaking to PTI, the 2011 World Cup winner said Abhishek’s fearless approach is a result of strong backing from India’s current leadership group, led by head coach Gautam Gambhir and captain Suryakumar Yadav . Yuvraj explained that this environment reminds him of the one that helped shape his own career under coach Gary Kirsten .“I think the fearlessness also comes with support from the coach and the captain,” Yuvraj said. “When the coach and captain allow you to go and play your game freely, you can express yourself better. That’s what I experienced when Gary Kirsten was coach — he always told me that if I played my natural game, I’d put India in a winning position.”Yuvraj added that the same mindset is now being instilled in Abhishek. “The confidence that Gautam and Suryakumar have given him — that if he plays his game, India will win six out of ten times — is exactly what’s helping him succeed,” he explained.The veteran believes this culture of trust has transformed India’s white-ball cricket, giving players the freedom to fail while chasing high-impact performances. He also noted that such an approach defined India’s golden era under Kirsten, and Gambhir and Suryakumar are now fostering that same fearless energy in a new generation led by Abhishek Sharma.","Yuvraj Singh says Abhishek Sharma's fearless approach is a result of strong backing from India’s current leadership group, led by head coach Gautam Gambhir and captain Suryakumar Yadav.

'A particularly special feeling': Andy Flower hails Virat Kohli, RCB after historic title win

NEW DELHI: The Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) franchise looks set to be sold before the start of the 2026 Indian Premier League ( IPL ) edition. In a letter to the Bombay Stock Exchange, United Spirits Limited (USL) - the Indian arm of Diageo PLC - has stated in line with SEBI disclosure obligations that USL is initiating a strategic review of its investments in Royal Challengers Sports Pvt Limited (RCSPL), a wholly owned subsidiary of the company.The process will be initiated for both men's and women's teams of RCB and USL has further mentioned in the disclosure that it expects the process to conclude by March 31, 2026. Praveen Someshwar, the MD and CEO of USL, has said, ""the RCSPL has been a valuable and strategic asset for USL. However, it is non-core to our alcohol-beverage business.""Someshwar further said that this step is to reinforce USL and Diageo's commitment to continue reviewing its India enterprise portfolio to enable sustained delivery of long term value to all stakeholders while also keeping RCSPL's best interest in mind.As of November 2025, the RCB franchise finds itself stuck in the middle of an ugly controversy in the aftermath of an unfortunate stampede which happened outside the Chinnaswamy Stadium on June 4. The crowd went out of control during the franchise's maiden IPL title celebrations and the matter snowballed into a political storm.Ever since the incident, it has been highly speculated that USL and Diageo would not be averse to parting with the franchise.Despite winning just one title in the IPL, RCB has been among three of the most valuable IPL franchises largely for two reasons - the presence of Virat Kohli, one of India's biggest cricket stars and the massive fandom it has managed to create in the last decade.

NEW DELHI: Former Australia all-rounder Shane Watson believes Shubman Gill is “ridiculously talented” and has the ability to make the necessary adjustments across formats to deliver big scores for India.Gill, who is leading India in both Tests and ODIs, has struggled for runs in the ongoing white-ball series against Australia, managing scores of 10, 9, and 24 in the three ODIs, followed by 37 not out, 5, and 15 in the T20 Internationals so far.The right-hander arrived in Australia on the back of fine form, having scored a hundred and a fifty in three innings during two Tests at home against the West Indies. The fourth T20I of the five-match series will be played on Thursday.“It does take time (to make adjustments), and it's through trial and error that you really realise exactly what you need to do to make those adjustments, and playing in different conditions as well,” Watson said.“But Shubman is a ridiculously talented batter. He's got an amazing technique. It's not going to take him long at all to be able to really navigate his way through the different formats because when someone is as highly skilled as he is, it's not going to take him too long.”Watson acknowledged that switching formats can be challenging, but said players improve with experience and game time.“It definitely is a challenge, and the more you do it, the better you get at really understanding the little adjustments that you have to make to your technique, to your game plan, your mindset around each format to be able to then get into the best version of you every time you have to make that adjustment,” said the 44-year-old, who represented Australia in 59 Tests, 190 ODIs, and 58 T20Is between 2002 and 2016.The former cricketer also heaped praise on India’s explosive opener Abhishek Sharma, who has impressed with his fearless batting in T20s.“He is an absolute treat to watch. He's incredibly good, isn't he? He is so fearless, but then he's got the skill to be able to adapt to whatever's required as well,” Watson said.“It's been special to see his evolution over the last two or three years, from when he first came in, got opportunities for Sunrisers Hyderabad. And then seeing him just continue to explode like he has. He's got all the different gears, he's got all the different shots against different bowlers in different conditions as well.”Abhishek, 25, played a key role in India’s Asia Cup triumph and has scored 19, 68, and 25 in the three T20Is so far against Australia.",Shane Watson hails Shubman Gill as 'ridiculously talented' Watson also praises Abhishek Sharma's fearless batting in T20s.

Punam Raut exclusive interview: Ex-cricketer breaks down after Harmanpreet Kaur's historic win

NEW DELHI: The Cricket Association of Bengal ( CAB ) will honour India wicketkeeper-batter Richa Ghosh with a specially crafted gold-plated bat and ball during a grand felicitation ceremony at Eden Gardens on Saturday, celebrating her stellar performance in India’s historic Women’s World Cup triumph.Richa, one of the driving forces behind India’s maiden title win, scored 235 runs in eight innings at a strike rate of 133.52 — the highest in the tournament — and finished among the team’s top five run-getters.The gold-plated bat and ball, signed by former India captain Sourav Ganguly and pace legend Jhulan Goswami, will be presented to her in recognition of her “outstanding achievements and invaluable contribution to Indian cricket.”CAB president Sourav Ganguly said the association was proud to celebrate a player who has brought glory to both Bengal and India with her fearless approach to the game.""Richa has shown remarkable talent, composure, and fighting spirit on the world stage. Honouring her with this gold bat and ball is a small token of our recognition for her extraordinary contribution to Indian cricket. She is an inspiration for every young cricketer in Bengal and across the country,” Ganguly stated in a release.Batting at No. 7, the 22-year-old from Siliguri provided crucial lower-order impetus, including a blistering 34 off 24 balls in the final against South Africa at the DY Patil Stadium, where India defeated Laura Wolvaardt’s side by 52 runs.Richa also smashed 12 sixes during the tournament, equalling Deandra Dottin’s record for the most sixes in a single Women’s World Cup.The second wicketkeeper from Siliguri to represent India after Wriddhiman Saha, Richa’s growing trophy collection now includes the Women’s World Cup, U-19 World Cup, Women’s Premier League title, Asian Games gold, and Commonwealth Games silver.In its statement, the CAB lauded Richa’s journey from Siliguri to international stardom as “a story of discipline, dedication, and self-belief,” adding that the felicitation aims to inspire more young girls across Bengal to pursue cricket.The daughter of club-level cricketer turned umpire Manabendra Ghosh, Richa’s prodigious talent was evident early — she was just eight years old when first spotted. She made the Bengal U-19 team at 12, broke into the U-23 side the same season, and debuted for the senior team at 13.A genuine all-rounder in her formative years, Richa opened both the batting and bowling, sharing the new ball with Jhulan Goswami — all while donning the wicketkeeping gloves.",Cricket Association of Bengal to honour India wicketkeeper-batter Richa Ghosh with a specially crafted gold-plated bat and ball.

Liverpool secured a 2-0 victory against Aston Villa in the Premier League , ending their four-game losing streak. Mohamed Salah achieved his 250th goal for the club, and Ryan Gravenberch added another goal to help the defending champions move up to third place in the standings.""I'm glad we are back on track now. It's a very tricky season for us because we have a few new players, they are very good players, but they need time to adapt. We lost some players too. It takes time to adapt and know each other's games, but everything will be fine,"" said Salah.Liverpool manager Arne Slot's decision to make multiple changes during Wednesday's 3-0 League Cup loss to Crystal Palace increased pressure on the returning players to secure a win after six defeats in seven games across all competitions.""What I liked most was that I think everybody here felt the importance of the game. I'm talking about my players and I'm talking about the fans. From start to finish the players showed up,"" said Slot.Liverpool faced early pressure when Morgan Rogers hit the post with a shot after five minutes. This continued their pattern of struggling in the opening 15 minutes, which had been evident in their previous four Premier League defeats.Villa initially showed strength in breaking through Liverpool's defense but later struggled with their own defensive play. Dominik Szoboszlai missed an opportunity after taking the ball from Pau Torres, shooting directly at Martinez.Hugo Ekitike's header goal was disallowed after VAR review showed he was offside from Szoboszlai's cross. Martinez's error then allowed Salah to score just before half-time, marking his 250th goal for Liverpool.Salah's goal, his fifth of the season, places him as Liverpool's third-highest scorer in club history, behind only Ian Rush and Roger Hunt. The goal also ended Liverpool's streak of conceding first in seven consecutive games.Villa entered the match having won their previous four league games, including victories over Tottenham and Manchester City. They were level on points with Liverpool before the game.Gravenberch, who had missed the previous weekend's 3-2 loss at Brentford due to an ankle injury, scored Liverpool's second goal. His shot deflected off Pau Torres, deceiving Martinez.Liverpool achieved their first clean sheet in 11 games. The team now prepares for upcoming matches against Real Madrid in the Champions League and Manchester City in the Premier League.Liverpool's recent poor form has created a significant challenge in their title defence against Arsenal. The victory reduced their gap behind Arsenal to seven points, providing a starting point for their return to the title race.Joao Pedro ended his goal drought for Chelsea by scoring the decisive goal in a 1-0 victory against Tottenham at their home stadium on Saturday.The Brazilian striker scored his first goal since August 30, when he last found the net against Fulham, breaking a nine-game goalless streak across all competitions.Since his £60 million transfer from Brighton during the transfer window, the 24-year-old has only managed to score three times for Chelsea.Chelsea moved to fourth place in the Premier League standings after securing their third win in four matches, trailing Tottenham only on goal difference.Tottenham's struggles at home continue, as they haven't secured a victory at their stadium since defeating Burnley in the season opener in August.Their poor home form in 2025 began under previous manager Ange Postecoglou and has persisted under Frank's leadership.Despite a League Cup defeat at Newcastle, Tottenham's away performances have been stronger, including a convincing 3-0 win at Everton in their last league match.Tottenham supporters are showing increasing dissatisfaction with Frank's tactical approach, which differs from the club's traditional attacking philosophy.An early setback occurred when Lucas Bergvall suffered a head injury and was replaced by Xavi Simons as a concussion substitute.Bergvall showed resistance to the medical staff's decision, pushing one of them before Frank stepped in to calm the situation.Alejandro Garnacho posed Chelsea's primary attacking threat in the first half, testing Tottenham goalkeeper Guglielmo Vicario with long-range attempts.Vicario recovered from a knee injury to make a crucial save, denying Joao Pedro after a defensive error by Pedro Porro.Joao Pedro broke the deadlock in the 34th minute, capitalising on Moises Caicedo's pressure on Simons and Van de Ven to score from close range.Frank expressed his frustration with Tottenham's defensive errors by kicking a water bottle on the sideline.Joao Pedro nearly doubled his tally, but Vicario saved his powerful shot following Malo Gusto's assist.Rodrigo Bentancur received a yellow card for a challenge on Reece James, which could have warranted a more severe punishment.Mohammed Kudus tested Chelsea goalkeeper Robert Sanchez just before halftime, but his shot was well saved.After the break, Enzo Fernandez missed a clear opportunity, heading over from James' cross from ten yards out.Tottenham's possession problems continued in the second half, leading to growing frustration among their supporters.Vicario was forced to make another save from Pedro Neto's powerful attempt, while Tottenham failed to mount a serious comeback in the closing stages.",Liverpool secured a 2-0 victory against Aston Villa in the Premier League.

Arsenal put more distance between them and the rest at the top of the Premier League table with a composed 2-0 victory over Burnley on Saturday, extending their winning run in the competition to five matches.The result pushed Mikel Arteta’s men seven points clear at the summit and further strengthened their bid to end a two-decade wait for the league title. Viktor Gyokeres opened the scoring with a well-timed header from Declan Rice’s corner in the first half, marking his first league goal since mid-September.Rice then doubled Arsenal’s advantage in the 35th minute, heading home from close range to give the visitors firm control at Turf Moor. Arsenal’s threat from set-pieces once again proved decisive, while their defensive record remained formidable, having conceded just three league goals in ten games this season.Arteta praised the balance in his side’s performances, saying his players had “shown maturity in difficult away games” and were “playing with a real sense of control.” The Gunners have now won nine straight games across all competitions, maintaining a consistent rhythm on both ends of the pitch.Burnley rarely threatened and remain in the bottom three, struggling to find form at home. Arsenal, meanwhile, continue to set the pace in the title race with another confident display built on discipline and precision. Manchester United were held to a 2-2 draw by Nottingham Forest in a tense contest at the City Ground, despite leading twice.Casemiro put United ahead in the first half, giving Ruben Amorim’s side hope of a fourth straight league win. However, Forest, who had not scored a league goal since September 20, produced a spirited response after the break.Morgan Gibbs-White equalised in the 48th minute with a strong header before Nicolo Savona completed a quick turnaround just two minutes later. United were forced to chase the game and eventually found a late equaliser through Amad Diallo, whose sharp volley in the 81st minute ensured the points were shared.Amorim later said his team “created enough to win” but admitted Forest “showed great character.” For Forest, manager Sean Dyche said he was “pleased with the fight shown,” though the result keeps them in the relegation zone, four points adrift of safety.United stay within reach of the top four but were left ruing missed chances in a match that tested their recent resurgence.",Manchester United were held to a 2-2 draw by Nottingham Forest.

More Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift coverage

Hollywood actor Miles Teller is opening up about what he believes will be the wedding of the century — Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce ’s long-awaited nuptials. Speaking to Parade at the SCAD Savannah Film Festival on Oct. 25, the 38-year-old actor couldn’t help but share his admiration and excitement for the couple while also playfully admitting that he’s not sure if he and his wife Keleigh Teller, 33, will actually be on the guest list.“Yeah, I don’t know,” Teller said when asked whether they’d been invited to the ceremony or any pre-wedding festivities. Still, he’s certain about one thing: “That is going to be, I imagine, one impressive wedding.” Despite the uncertainty, he added that he’s “just very happy for them.”Having known both Swift and Kelce for years, Miles Teller expressed nothing but support for their happiness. “I’ve known Trav for a while, too. And, yeah, I think they’re having a blast,” he told Parade. “That’s the point.”Just weeks after Swift, 35, and Kelce, 36, announced their engagement, the actor celebrated their milestone while attending the Toronto International Film Festival for his film Eternity on Sept.7. “Anytime you find the person you want to spend forever with, that’s such exciting news,” he told E! News, adding, “That’s the first step of life-long companionship.” When asked about the idea of double dating with the newly engaged pair, Teller laughed and replied, “Yeah, exactly. ”During the Savannah Film Festival, Teller was honored with the Distinguished Performance Award for his work in Eternity, presented by co-star Da’Vine Joy Randolph. While promoting the film, he reflected on the meaning of love and commitment — themes that resonate deeply with Swift and Kelce’s relationship.Meanwhile, Swift herself offered a few lighthearted details about her upcoming wedding while appearing on The Graham Norton Show. When asked about the big day, she teased, “Oh, you’ll know,” adding that Norton was already on the guest list. The pop superstar described the event as “huge,” explaining that smaller ceremonies make her nervous. “I’m inviting everyone I’ve ever talked to,” she joked.Although Teller isn’t sure whether his invitation is on the way, he clearly holds no hard feelings. The actor admires both Swift and Kelce and has no doubt their wedding will be unforgettable. “That is going to be, I imagine, one impressive wedding,” he reiterated.Whether or not he and Keleigh make the final cut, Teller’s reaction perfectly captures the public’s excitement — a mix of curiosity, admiration, and joy for the couple whose love story has captured the world’s attention.","Miles Teller is not sure if he and his wife Keleigh Teller will actually be on the guest list.

Erin Andrews explains why she chose to suffer in silence during her cervical cancer diagnosis while covering the NFL,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/erin-andrews-explains-why-she-chose-to-suffer-in-silence-during-her-cervical-cancer-diagnosis-while-covering-the-nfl/articleshow/125107848.cms,"Erin Andrews bravely shares her past battle with cervical cancer, a secret she held close due to the male-dominated NFL world she inhabits. Her diagnosis, stemming from routine care, underscores the critical importance of early detection. Now, she urges everyone to prioritize health appointments, emphasizing that facing medical realities is paramount, even without public pronouncements of fear.

Erin Andrews says early detection changed everything and now she wants people to stop skipping appointments

More coverage on NFL:

In 2017, Erin Andrews was navigating planes, NFL production meetings, Fox broadcast rehearsals and “Dancing With the Stars”, while also holding the most terrifying secret of her life. Andrews says she didn’t even feel she had permission to speak her truth at the time, because her cancer diagnosis felt too intimate for her to insert into the loud, masculine world she works in.She was being paid to break down defensive schemes and quarterback reads, not talk about her reproductive system. For years, she quietly carried the dual reality of being a household-name broadcaster and a woman terrified of what her body was doing to her. Nearly a decade later, she’s talking, because she now sees purpose in the conversation.""It was really hard. I kept it quiet when I was dealing with cancer because it was cervical cancer. It was a very personal cancer,"" Andrews tells Popsugar. ""I work with a lot of men. I didn't want to be talking about the Ravens's defense and my cervix at the dinner table.""Her diagnosis didn’t arrive in a dramatic Hollywood way, it came from routine care.A regular check-up turned into a life-altering call. As she recalled, “..[I] didn't think anything of it. And then a couple of days later, I was sitting in a meeting room getting ready for week three of the NFL season, and my gynecologist called me and said, you have cancer and we need to do surgery immediately.”The medical fight wasn’t the only burden, motherhood became a parallel emotional gauntlet. “We had had two losses before we had our son. So it's been a real rollercoaster.” Andrews shared that she ultimately built her family via surrogacy, a path many women rarely feel safe enough to say out loud.Today, even with nonstop travel, an active toddler, and podcast work, she still prioritizes her body. “I feel like working out is a big thing for me mentally…today, I went to Barry's Bootcamp and I ran my ass off and it felt so damn good,” she says.Her message is simple: you don’t need to announce the fear to the world, but you must face the doctor.","Erin Andrews was diagnosed with cervical cancer in 2007.

Tom Brady credited biotech and a preserved blood sample for giving his family what he called a “second chance”

More coverage on NFL:

For most people, losing a long-time family pet becomes one of those non-negotiable heartbreaks you eventually just learn to live with. But for Tom Brady, retirement chapters or not, grief wasn’t something he was willing to simply accept as a permanent ending. Nearly two years after the death of his pit bull mix Lua, the former New England Patriots quarterback confirmed that his new dog, Junie, is actually a genetic duplicate.The decision wasn’t a casual luxury purchase, it was engineered, partly through a biotech company he financially backs. And in 2025, that revelation doesn’t sound like sci-fi anymore, it sounds like a billionaire-era reality.Brady said his family leaned on Colossal Biosciences, the same company now tied to de-extinction concepts and the newly acquired Viagen Pets. The process used a blood draw taken from Lua before her death in December 2023.“I love my animals. They mean the world to me and my family,” he said in a statement obtained by PEOPLE. “A few years ago, I worked with Colossal and leveraged their non-invasive cloning technology through a simple blood draw of our family's elderly dog before she passed.”Brady also noted that the outcome wasn’t just a sentimental indulgence, he sees broader potential.The company “gave my family a second chance with a clone of our beloved dog,” and he added that he is “excited how Colossal and Viagen's tech together can help both families losing their beloved pets while helping to save endangered species.”That final line is where this story jumps from emotional headline to scientific frontier. Critics online are already debating whether cloning is compassionate or morally distorted. But Brady, who co-parents multiple pets with ex-wife Gisele Bündchen, has made his stance unmistakably public. Whether audiences call it beautiful, disturbing, or both, it signals that legacy and loyalty in Brady’s world can now be engineered instead of mourned.","Tom Brady used a biotech firm to create Junie, a genetic duplicate.

Once Swift's primary girl-group companion, Lively now observes Mahomes in private suites and public events. Insiders suggest this shift, fueled by Swift's legal dramas and growing bond with Mahomes, is an emotional adjustment for Lively, altering their once effortless friendship dynamic.

Blake Lively feels sidelined as Taylor Swift prioritizes her new post-engagement life

More coverage on NFL:

For nearly a decade, Blake Lively was comfortably positioned as Taylor Swift ’s closest off-camera confidante, the one in the getaway cars, afterparties, and ultra-private dinners. But in 2025, the social ecosystem around Swift looks entirely different. From private Arrowhead suites to VIP tunnels in stadiums across America, another woman now sits next to the Kansas City Chiefs star’s fiancée. And insiders say Lively can feel the shift.Sources told Rob Shuter that Swift’s growing bond with Brittany Mahomes, after a roller-coaster year of legal drama, has been “a tough emotional adjustment” for the actress. It’s not that the friendship is broken forever, but the dynamic no longer resembles the effortless, playful, girls-night inner circle Swift and Lively once curated.Shuter’s Substack sources didn’t sugarcoat how the power shift feels from Lively’s side. “Blake used to be Taylor’s go-to for girls’ nights, glamour, fun ,she was the closest confidante,” a source said. “Now Brittany is in all the photos, all the private suites, getting all the attention. Blake is… adjusting.”Another voice close to the situation claimed the discomfort isn’t villain-driven, it’s emotional math.“It’s not toxic — it’s human. Blake has always been the one by Taylor’s side at big events. Suddenly, someone else is sitting in that literal and metaphorical seat.”And the quiet sting deepened when Lively didn’t publicly congratulate Swift on her engagement to Travis Kelce , something fans flagged instantly. A second source added, “Taylor builds deep friendships — and she has room for everyone. But Blake liked being the main character in the best-friend storyline.”Insiders insist the two are still cordial, Lively even dropped a subtle nod to Swift’s new album, but this is not the seamless BFF bond that once felt unshakeable.In 2025, the Swift universe looks different and Blake Lively is reluctantly learning how to orbit it from a new distance.","Blake Lively is reportedly finding it difficult to adjust as Taylor Swift's new close confidante.

Judge shuts down Justin Baldoni’s countersuit against Blake Lively

More coverage on the NFL -



Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce distanced themselves from Blake Lively when she ended up dragging the billionaire pop star into her scandalous legal drama with Justin Baldoni. The It Ends With Us actors entered into a dramatic lawsuit earlier this year, and now, there’s a new twist to the case.In the last one year, Blake Lively mostly maintained a low profile as she remained involved in the legal mess with Justin Baldoni. But now, it seems things might be improving for her.A few days ago, Judge Lewis Liman formally ended the lawsuit that Justin Baldoni filed against Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds, claiming civil extortion, defamation and invasion of privacy.A few months ago, in June 2025, Justin Baldoni’s case was initially dismissed by the judge. But in a shocking turn of events, the popular actor was given the chance to file an amended complaint.However, on 17th October 2025, Judge Lewis Liman announced that he would formally end the case, after four months of Justin Baldoni not filing the amended complaint.It seems Justin Baldoni also ended up missing this warning as well as only Blake Lively ended up asking for the final judgment to be declared.Back in June, when Justin Baldoni’s case was dismissed, his legal team said, “While the court dismissed the defamation related claims, the court has invited us to amend four out of the seven claims against Ms Lively, which will showcase additional evidence and refined allegations.""While it might seem a big win for Blake Lively now, her friendship with Taylor Swift has come to a dramatic end.Taylor Swift has completely avoided Blake Lively since close to a year and it seems the actress is also worried about her future now.As per Radar Online, a source has revealed that, ""Blake's worried this whole situation could damage Ryan's reputation. She'd do whatever it takes to make things right, but Taylor has totally shut her out.""The source added, ""Losing Taylor's friendship is painful enough, but Blake's really scared about what it could mean for her career. Taylor has huge influence – if Hollywood were a high school, she'd be the head cheerleader. When she decides someone's out, everyone pays attention.”Neither Taylor Swift nor Blake Lively has addressed the controversy in public yet.","Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce distanced themselves from Blake Lively when she ended up dragging the billionaire pop star into her scandalous legal drama with Justin Baldoni.

Stroud injury update: Texans QB ruled out for Week 10 with concussion, Davis Mills to start for Texans vs. Jaguars",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/c-j-stroud-injury-update-texans-qb-ruled-out-for-week-10-with-concussion-davis-mills-to-start-for-texans-vs-jaguars/articleshow/125117722.cms,"Getty

Davis Mills steps into the spotlight for Texans vs. Jaguars

How Stroud’s absence changes the Texans’ offensive game plan

More on player trades:



Well, Houston fans didn’t need this kind of midweek heartbreak. Star quarterback C.J. Stroud has officially been ruled out for Week 10 against the Jacksonville Jaguars, after suffering a concussion in last Sunday’s matchup with the Denver Broncos. The hit which came as Stroud slid to the turf late in the game left fans holding their breath as medical staff evaluated him.Head coach DeMeco Ryans confirmed on Wednesday that the 2023 Offensive Rookie of the Year won’t suit up this week, saying Stroud remains in concussion protocol and the team won’t take any chances with his health. It’s a tough blow for Houston, which currently sits right in the thick of the AFC South race.With Stroud sidelined, the Texans are turning the offense over to Davis Mills, a familiar face in Houston. Mills stepped in briefly during the Broncos game and now gets his first start of the 2025 season and it couldn’t come in a more critical spot. The Texans face Trevor Lawrence and the Jaguars, a divisional rival that’s fighting for the same playoff positioning.Mills, who started 26 games for the Texans between 2021 and 2022, has shown flashes of solid play in the past but struggled with consistency.Still, teammates and coaches are expressing confidence that he can handle the pressure. Ryans told reporters the team trusts Mills to “run the offense efficiently and keep things on schedule.”Stroud’s absence is going to shake up Houston’s offensive rhythm. The chemistry he’s built with wideouts Nico Collins and Tank Dell has been a big part of their explosive success this season. Without him, expect a heavier dose of the run game with Dameon Pierce and Devin Singletary, and a more conservative approach through the air.For fantasy managers, it’s a headache, Collins, Dell and tight end Dalton Schultz may all see reduced production. The Texans’ high-tempo offense under Stroud will likely slow down, as Mills adjusts to taking over against a Jaguars defense that thrives on turnovers.The Texans’ playoff hopes don’t vanish with Stroud out, but they do get a little cloudy. The team has shown resilience all season, and a strong performance by Mills could keep them in contention until their QB1 returns.Still, the priority is clear: Stroud’s health comes first. The 23-year-old has quickly become Houston’s franchise cornerstone, and rushing him back isn’t worth the risk. If Mills can pull off an upset against the Jaguars, it might just turn one of the Texans’ scariest weeks into their most defining moment yet.","Houston Texans quarterback C.J.

Rutgers Scarlett Knight made the best decision yet. The team opened the season with an impressive win over the Rider Broncs, all thanks to their latest addition, Tariq Francis. A part of the second transfer for the retooling program of the 2025 spring, Francis signed with Rutgers. However, this transfer was widely predicted within the NCAA sports community. The 6’1” tall shooting guard previously played for the NJIT Highlanders. His performance made him one of the top scorers in East America.Tariq is from Pittsburgh, a city in Pennsylvania. His father was a close friend of Rutgers’ assistant coach, Brandin Knight. Tariq is known for racking up scores in bunches, and this is a major reason he was added to the team. The athlete proved the point with his game-high score in Rutgers’ season opener.Tariq Francis has made a name for himself during his time with the NJIT Highlanders. His season average stood at 19.3 points, with 4.3 rebounds and 3.6 assists. Some of his notable performances were against teams like Villanova Wildcats, Seton Hall, George Washington Revolutionaries, and UMass Minutemen. In each of these games, Tariq showcased his dunk skills and led his team to a victory.To arrive at a season average figure as mentioned above, Tariq shot 37 percent from the field, 32 percent from 3-point range and 84 percent from the free-throw line. In the past season, the Highlanders concluded 6-25 overall and 3-13 in the league. After such an impressive performance, the athlete earned America East Rookie of the Year honors.While his gameplay has earned him accolades across both his years in college until now, very little is known about his personal life. It is almost as if the athlete is purely focused on improving his game. Tariq has a huge tattoo on his right hand. It reads ‘Tiffany.’ While nothing is known about the real meaning behind the tattoo, it is probably related to someone close to him.Apart from all these, the player seems to be all prepared to conquer this season as part of Rutgers. While he opened the season for the team on a high note, the expectations have increased for the player.","Tariq Francis is a 6’1” tall shooting guard who previously played for the NJIT Highlanders.

Tony Allen's arrest details: drugs, paraphernalia, and a troubling turn



A legacy overshadowed by legal struggles



Former Memphis Grizzlies icon Tony Allen, once hailed as one of the fiercest defenders in NBA history, is back in the spotlight, however, for all the wrong reasons. The 43-year-old, known to fans as “The Grindfather,” was arrested in Poinsett County, Arkansas, on Wednesday afternoon following a traffic stop that led to serious drug-related charges. Deputies pulled over a vehicle on Interstate 555 near Payneway, where Allen was a passenger. What began as a routine stop quickly escalated after officers noticed a strong smell of marijuana coming from the car.According to court records, Allen was booked into the Poinsett County Jail and charged with possession of less than two grams of a Schedule 1 or 2 controlled substance and possession of less than four ounces of a Schedule 4 drug. Authorities confirmed the substances were cocaine and marijuana, respectively.Sheriff Kevin Molder said deputies approached the car driven by 33-year-old William Hatton, with Tony Allen seated beside him. The officers’ report stated that a “strong odor of marijuana” led to a search of the vehicle (per The Associated Press).Deputies allegedly found a small package of marijuana on Allen and, inside a cigarette box near his seat, a clear plastic wrapper containing a white powdery substance later confirmed to be cocaine.Hatton reportedly admitted to owning additional drug paraphernalia found in the car. Both men were taken to the Poinsett County Detention Center following the arrest.Allen faces charges of possession of meth or cocaine and possession of marijuana, while Hatton was also cited for improper lane change and possession of paraphernalia.The arrest took place less than a year after the Memphis Grizzlies retired Allen’s No. 9 jersey, honoring his gritty defensive legacy alongside teammates Marc Gasol and Zach Randolph. Allen helped define the “Grit and Grind” era from 2010 to 2017, earning six NBA All-Defensive Team selections — including three first-team honors.This isn’t Allen’s first encounter with the law. In August 2023, he pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit health care and wire fraud in a case involving false insurance claims within the NBA community. Though he avoided prison time and was sentenced to time served, the plea cast a shadow on his post-retirement reputation.Now, with his recent arrest involving cocaine and marijuana possession, the former Celtics champion and Grizzlies legend faces another serious setback. Once celebrated for his hard-nosed discipline on the court, Tony Allen’s latest legal troubles serve as a sobering reminder of how quickly fame can unravel when life off the court takes a darker turn.Also Read: Stephen Curry faces unexpected health scare moments after leading Warriors past Phoenix Suns in dramatic win","Former Memphis Grizzlies star Tony Allen was arrested in Arkansas on drug- related charges.

The decision comes after Curry’s recent battle with illness and visible fatigue, which has hindered his recovery despite his determined effort to play through it. The team is prioritizing his long-term health, especially considering the packed early-season schedule and his importance to their championship aspirations.Stephen Curry’s absence will undoubtedly be felt, as the two-time MVP has been the driving force behind Golden State’s offense. Coming off a strong 28-point performance with five three-pointers in the Golden State Warriors’ 118-107 win over the Phoenix Suns on November 4, he demonstrated his usual brilliance despite feeling under the weather. However, after the game, Curry admitted he was “running on empty” during the second half, confirming that his energy levels had dipped significantly due to a lingering cold and the effects of back-to-back games.Golden State Warriors head coach Steve Kerr addressed the media and confirmed that Stephen Curry will not suit up against the Kings. He emphasized that the star guard has been struggling with illness and exhaustion for several days, and the coaching staff decided that rest was necessary to avoid aggravating his condition.Kerr highlighted that the team’s focus remains on maintaining player health and preventing burnout, especially during a stretch that features consecutive road and home games.The demanding travel schedule has also played a role in the decision, with the Golden State Warriors having logged multiple trips across the West Coast in the past week. With Curry sitting out, the Warriors will look to rely more heavily on their supporting cast to keep up their momentum against Sacramento.Adding to the Warriors’ concerns, Jimmy Butler’s availability for the Kings game is in doubt after he exited the previous matchup early due to lower-back soreness. The team is handling his situation with caution, as they aim to avoid worsening the issue so early in the season. Kerr noted that Butler’s status remains day-to-day, with his participation likely to be determined closer to tipoff.

The four-time NBA champion continues to recover from a right-side sciatica issue that has sidelined him since the start of the 2025-26 season. This latest update marks the ninth consecutive game LeBron will miss, as the Lakers maintain a cautious approach to ensure his long-term health.While fans eagerly await his return, the Lakers are taking no chances with the 40-year-old’s recovery timeline. Team doctors and medical staff have prioritized rest and treatment to prevent aggravating the condition. Early expectations suggest that if recovery continues to progress smoothly, LeBron could make his long-awaited return sometime in mid-November.Despite the absence of their leader, the Lakers have been in impressive form, entering the Spurs game with a 6-2 record. Luka Doncic, the team’s marquee playmaker, will once again spearhead the offense after returning from minor injuries that caused him to miss a few games earlier in the season. Austin Reaves, who is dealing with right groin soreness, is listed as questionable but could potentially feature to provide depth and spacing on the floor.The Lakers have made necessary adjustments in LeBron James’ absence, emphasizing ball movement, defensive pressure, and fast-break execution. Head coach Darvin Ham has leaned on younger talents such as Rui Hachimura and Jarred Vanderbilt to fill the void, while Doncic continues to orchestrate plays with his trademark vision and efficiency.LeBron James’ condition involves inflammation or irritation of the sciatic nerve, which runs from the lower back down through the legs. This injury can cause sharp pain, numbness, or limited mobility, making it difficult for a player to perform at peak physical condition. The Lakers’ medical team has chosen a conservative recovery plan that includes physical therapy, targeted rest, and gradual load management to ensure the 21-year veteran returns fully fit. The plan is designed to prevent setbacks rather than risk an early comeback that could jeopardize the rest of the season.The Spurs entered the contest with a strong 5-1 record, setting up a competitive Western Conference matchup at the Crypto.com Arena. The Lakers’ injury list also includes several rotational players, but the team remains confident with Doncic and Jaxson Hayes expected to feature prominently. This game serves as an opportunity for the Lakers to test their depth and sustain momentum while waiting for their superstar’s return.Although LeBron’s on-court presence remains missed, his leadership continues to influence the team from the sidelines. He has been actively mentoring younger players and encouraging a collective mindset that prioritizes defense and ball sharing. The Lakers organization remains optimistic about his mid-November return, aiming to reintegrate him gradually into the lineup.Also read: Is Luka Doncic playing tonight vs the San Antonio Spurs?

Thewill enter their matchup against the San Antonio Spurs on November 5, 2025, with some encouraging news - superstar guard. The contest, set at Crypto.com Arena, carries major implications for both teams, especially as the Lakers aim to maintain their early-season momentum amid lingering injury concerns.After being sidelined earlier in the season with minor injuries, Doncic’s return is a massive boost for the Lakers’ lineup. The 26-year-old has been a vital part of the team’s offensive rhythm, and his on-court presence often dictates the Lakers’ success. His availability tonight restores confidence among fans and teammates alike as the team prepares to take on Victor Wembanyama and the young Spurs squad.Recent updates confirm that Luka Doncic has been removed from the Los Angeles Lakers’ injury report, indicating that he is fully fit and cleared to participate. This marks the end of a cautious recovery period, during which the Lakers’ medical staff opted to rest him strategically to avoid aggravating his earlier injuries to the left finger and leg.Earlier this season, Doncic missed three games while undergoing treatment and recovery. However, the team’s decision to rest him appears to have paid off. His name being off the report is a strong sign that he’s not only healthy but also ready to take on full minutes against the Spurs.Since returning to action, Luka Doncic has wasted no time reminding everyone why he’s one of the NBA’s most impactful players. In a recent performance following his brief absence, the Los Angeles Lakers star erupted for a 29-point triple-double, signaling that his rhythm and explosiveness are back. His presence significantly alters the team’s dynamic, particularly with his playmaking and ability to control the game’s tempo.The Lakers have also managed Doncic carefully to ensure he remains healthy for the long haul. The coaching staff’s measured approach early in the season has allowed him to fully recover while still contributing when needed. With Doncic now in peak form, the Lakers are poised to strengthen their position in the Western Conference standings.While Doncic’s clearance is a major relief, the Los Angeles Lakers still face uncertainty regarding other key players. Austin Reaves, one of the team’s most reliable guards, remains questionable for tonight’s game due to groin soreness. Reaves missed the previous contest and continues to be evaluated on a day-to-day basis. His potential absence could again test the Lakers’ depth in the backcourt.Despite these lingering concerns, the Lakers’ lineup appears strong enough to handle the Spurs, especially with Doncic leading the way. Head coach Darvin Ham will likely rely on his star guard to set the tone early and exploit mismatches against the Spurs’ defense.Luka Doncic’s return adds another layer of excitement to an already intriguing matchup between the Los Angeles Lakers and Spurs. Fans can expect the Lakers to lean heavily on his playmaking and scoring as they aim to extend their winning streak. With Reaves’ status still uncertain, Doncic’s leadership will be even more critical in maintaining offensive balance.Also read: San Antonio Spurs vs Los Angeles Lakers regular season game: Full injury report, who’s out, and more (November 5, 2025) As the Lakers take the court at Crypto.com Arena, all eyes will be on Luka Doncic, whose health and form could be the deciding factor in tonight’s outcome.

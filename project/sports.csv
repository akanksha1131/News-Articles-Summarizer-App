'I'm looking at building the franchise with Pant'

LSG owner Sanjiv Goenka talks to TOI on his expectations from the new captain....

Can Rishabh's price tag become a burden?

How important is it to have a culture of your own?

KOLKATA: Rishabh Pant's credentials as a leader are growing fast. The wicketkeeper-batter was on Monday named captain of Lucknow Super Giants ( LSG ), the IPL franchise that broke the bank for him at a mind-boggling Rs 27 cr. That at least two franchises were willing to go beyond the Rs 20 crore mark for him proves the kind of trust that Pant commands.""We would not have stopped at this amount,"" LSG owner Sanjiv Goenka says. Pant , however, wasn't surprised. ""Of course I was happy, but it was never about money,"" he told TOI in an exclusive interview.Leadership for me is more about looking after the players. How can you get the best out of them. How can you create an environment where they feel safe and stable so that they can give their 200%.I wasn't surprised, I have to say this (chuckles). But for me it wasn't about the money anyway. When I came to the auction, money wasn't in my thoughts, but I must say I was very happy with what I got. I wanted to be in a place where I could create the right environment with the help of the management. Create a franchise where people aspire to come, play and give their 100%.It's definitely a comfort zone as we have a lot of players who have experience in leadership in international cricket. You want to share that and it's always good to take the views of your seniors. A captain is as good as the team and everyone in the room is also thinking about the game. So, if you listen to everyone, keep everything in account and then make decisions, it is always good for the team. A good leader is always a good listener and that is something I would like to take forward.I've thought about it. I tried to tone myself down and I wanted to change a little, as people sometimes don't like it if I'm a little extroverted. With time you improve as an individual. Your decision-making changes. So, it's a mix of a lot of things. But after my car accident, I realized that there is no need to tone down. If I am excited about something, it means I care about it. Sometimes when you play cricket for a few years, your excitement goes down and you stop enjoying the game. You may be in a different position in your career, but that doesn't mean you need to change.I started playing cricket because I loved it. The thought process was to play for India and give my 200%. Now that I am blessed to be doing that, if I stop enjoying it means I am deviating from my goals. I promised myself that I am going to enjoy it more. There are a few people in the world who can do what they like and make money out of it, and why not. I see it as an opportunity. Coming to a new franchise is an opportunity.I joined when I was 17-18, so it was a very emotional decision. But we are professionals, and this is what we do. I'm not thinking much about that now. Once the decision was made, I knew it would be a very difficult one. I knew I would feel bad but I can't be living in the past. I'd like to move on and get better. Now it's a different family for me and I'll look to build more relationships with the people here.The price tag (for Pant) was only relevant till the time the auction didn't happen. Thereafter, he is the leader. It's not about the tag. It's about his leadership, his performance, how he motivates players, how he strategizes. So, I haven't thought about the price tag for a moment after the auction got over. Everyone has got the same Rs 120 crore purse and it's your discretion on how you distribute it. Rishabh deserves that price. If the bidding had gone on and it was Rs 28 crore, I still would have gone for him as he was fundamental to all our plans. It's about the skills he brings. I'm looking at it for the next 10-12 years. He is 27 and will play till 40. I'm looking at building the franchise with him. The more I see him, the more I'm convinced he is the perfect choice for us.It's important for everyone to feel comfortable and happy. That is what we want to create. Also, we want to have an atmosphere of never-say-die attitude. These are the things that I feel Rishabh embodies. No owner is looking to win all the matches. As long as the win ratio is more than losses, it is good for us.","Rishabh Pant was on Monday named captain of Lucknow Super Giants ( LSG ), the IPL franchise that broke the bank for him at a mind-boggling Rs 27 cr.

Champions Trophy Squad: Chief selector Ajit Agarkar and skipper Rohit Sharma PC

NEW DELHI: The player who completes the Indian playing XI for the ICC Champions Trophy next month is Hardik Pandya , according to former Pakistani wicketkeeper batter Kamran Akmal Prior to being sidelined by an injury sustained during the campaign, Hardik was an essential part of India's ODI World Cup 2023 campaign.His ability to chip in with the ball with ease and his dynamic batting show make him an invaluable member of the Men in Blue.""The main player in the Indian team, without him the playing XI is incomplete is Hardik Pandya. He is my favourite, he is remarkable with the bat and the ball. He finishes the game as well,"" Kamran said on his YouTube channel.In addition to Kamran, former Indian cricketer Suresh Raina said that the all-round talent of Hardik Pandya will be crucial to India's success in the ICC Champions Trophy.""The most important role will be Hardik Pandya's--when he bowls and whether he bowls in tandem with Kuldeep Yadav ,"" Raina said on Star Sports Press Room.

Coco Gauff 's dreams of clinching another Grand Slam title came to an abrupt end as her forehand and serve faltered against Paula Badosa in the Australian Open quarterfinals on Tuesday. The No. 3 seed was eliminated by the 27-year-old Spaniard, who secured a straight-set victory, 7-5, 6-4, to advance to her maiden Grand Slam semifinal.Gauff, riding high on a 13-match winning streak and a flawless 9-0 record in 2025, entered the match brimming with confidence following her triumph at the WTA Finals last November. Despite her momentum, the 2023 US Open champion struggled to maintain consistency, committing 41 unforced errors, including six costly double faults and 28 missed forehands. Her serve woes were particularly evident, with a double fault handing Badosa a critical break to lead 5-2 in the second set.Badosa, seeded No. 11, displayed remarkable composure and resilience. ""She’s full of confidence. But I’m playing well, too,"" Badosa said before the match. Her confidence proved justified as she outmaneuvered Gauff in key moments, neutralizing the American's typically dominant baseline game.Gauff's inability to generate a single break point until late in the second set further highlighted her struggles. By the time she began to mount a resistance, the deficit was too great to overcome. At just 20 years old, Gauff will look to rebound in the upcoming tournaments, but this loss serves as a stark reminder of the challenges at the highest level of competition.For Badosa, this victory marks a significant milestone in her career. The Spaniard will now aim to carry her momentum into the semifinals, with her sights set on an even deeper run at Melbourne Park .","Coco Gauff's dreams of clinching another Grand Slam title came to an abrupt end as her forehand and serve faltered against Paula Badosa.

NEW DELHI: Paarl Royals defeated Joburg Super Kings completed a comfortable run-chase as the home team strolled home with six wickets intact for their third win in succession.The Joburg Super Kings batting order was held to 146/6 by the Royals, who were bowled out by Bjorn Fortuin Mujeeb Ur Rahman , Joe Root, and Dunith Wellalage .In the Powerplay, Fortuin (2/22) took two wickets to start the JSK decline, which set the stage for Mujeeb (1/28) and the others.""Very delighted, nice to get over the line. It was one of the wickets where we went with the spin and it worked out. I had too many options at one point which was great,"" Royals captain David Miller said.""We had them by the throat, but the last two overs let us down but that is the nature of the game. I thought it was a par score.""If not for Donovan Ferreira's undefeated 32 off 19 balls, which helped the Super Kings add 65 runs in the final five overs, and England's double World Cup winner Jonny Bairstow (60 off 40 balls, 2x4, 3x6), it would have been much lower.""I thought we had a competitive score, after they took wickets early on with their bowlers put us on the back foot and fair play to them,"" Bairstow said.""If you go a bit too early, then you might be 5-6 down early, but if you are brave enough to keep wickets in the back end, to exploit the shorter side then you get rewards at the end. If you're brave enough to take it to the end, and having myself and Don with a bit of firepower to exploit the shorter side was great, but maybe 15-20 short.""The Royals maintained control of the run chase despite a little setback as seamer Hardus Viljoen (2/23) quickly removed both Joe Root and Pretorius.""The guys at the top batted really well and got us off to a good start which got us ahead of the game,"" Miller added.This season, Miller has excelled at his ""finisher"" role, joining Mitchell van Buuren (44 off 45 balls) for a 71-run stand for the fourth wicket.By crushing Lutho Sipamla for a huge maximum, Miller finished the job in style and put the Royals in a strong position to guarantee a playoff berth.""We've got an adaptable squad and we play according to the condition and the last two years we started really well and finished badly, and that is something we keep in mind and we have all bases covered for now,"" he said.","Paarl Royals defeat Joburg Super Kings by six wickets to complete comfortable run-chase. It is the third win in a row for the Royals, who have won their last two matches. The Royals were bowled out for 146 by the Super Kings, who were reduced to 146-6 in their innings.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117410505,imgsize-43164,width-400,resizemode-4/117410505.jpg"

Dushmantha Chameera and Zahir Khan 's three-wicket hauls led a strong bowling effort that held the Vipers to 139. With a scorching 78-run innings off 51 balls, Gulbadin Naib then spearheaded the chase and made sure the Capitals ended a three-match losing streak.With a scorching opening performance, captain Lockie Ferguson kept the Vipers in the game despite the poor first innings total. Ferguson put the Capitals in difficulty at 17/2 after catching Ben Dunk and Khalid Shah in the second over. Opener Shai Hope was run out for eight runs after a mix-up with Gulbadin Naib in the sixth over, despite the run rate being on target.The needed run rate was reduced to fewer than six runs per over when Naib, who had also been dropped for two runs earlier in the innings, made amends in the very next over by taking Nathan Sowter out for three sixes. With Sikandar Raza at one end, Naib hammered his way to a half-century of 31 balls, which included three sixes and two fours.In just 36 balls, the two brought up a 50-run partnership for the fourth wicket. Since the Capitals needed 32 runs in 36 balls at the 14-over stage, they were firmly in control.In the 15th over, Raza, who had taken few opportunities thus far, was caught for 24 runs in 26 balls off the shorter one from Mohammad Amir. As Naib continued to control the Vipers' bowling attack, Najibullah Zadran joined him. As the Capitals reached the target in 17.4 overs, Naib hit two more sixes.The Vipers, who batted first, got off to a quick start and ended the powerplay with 48/1. Before Dushmantha Chameera bowled him in the second over, Fakhar Zaman set the tone early with a six and a four. Alex Hales led the innings from the opposite end, while Dan Lawrence, who came in at number three, mirrored Zaman's intention.Nevertheless, despite a 58-run stand between Hales and Lawrence, the Capitals took control in the middle innings. Hales, Lawrence, and Sam Curran were all dismissed in three overs, dealing the Vipers a swift triple blow. In the tenth over, Haider Ali removed Hales for 34, and then Gulbadin Naib stopped Lawrence's 24-run attempt. The Vipers were then battling at 80/4 in 11.3 overs as Curran was stumped off Sikandar Raza for three runs.The collapse continued as the Vipers were bowled out for 139 in 20 overs. Wanindu Hasaranga (13) and Azam Khan (10) made brief contributions until both were overtaken by Zahir Khan. In his 27 runs off 24 balls, Sherfane Rutherford gave some hope by hitting three sixes, but Chameera hit for the third time in the penultimate over to put an end to his attack.Player of the Match, Gulbadin Naib said, ""We were at the bottom of the table, so we were looking for momentum. There's still a long way to go. It's not easy facing bowlers of this quality. Luckily, I gave myself some time. After the drinks break, the staff told me I was looking good, so I said to Sikandar, I will play to my strengths.""Desert Vipers captain, Lockie Ferguson said, ""It was a tough one. We were probably a few runs short and had some chances. They bowled well, and the pitch spun. There's a quick turnaround again, but the boys have been batting beautifully.""",Dubai Capitals beat Desert Vipers by six wickets. Dushmantha Chameera and Zahir Khan take three-wicket hauls.

NEW DELHI: The wait is finally over. India men's senior selection committee chaired by Ajit Agarkar will pick India's provisional squad for the upcoming Champions Trophy tomorrow (January 18) in Mumbai and they are set to face a happy headache while doing the same. While top-order is more or less clear, they need to find the right pieces for the middle-order puzzle. There are plenty of players in the mix for those 3-4 positions but Shreyas Iyer remains a no-brainer for the middle-overs period.With the right mix of caution and aggression, he has aced the 50-over game in the past and had a stellar 2023 ODI World Cup where he amassed 530 runs in 11 innings. The runs came at a healthy strike-rate and he hit two hundreds and three half-centuries during India's campaign. The right-hander had a turbulent little period where he lost out on an annual contract but bounced back in emphatic fashion during the IPL where he led KKR to the title.There were three ordinary outings against Sri Lanka in the ODIs but he rediscovered the touch during the domestic season where he made substantial contributions, across formats, for Mumbai. 452 runs in five First Class innings were followed by 345 runs in Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy and 325 runs in five List A fixtures. He has the weight of runs behind him but more importantly has the game suited for the surfaces in Dubai. With spin expected to play a major role in the tournament, Iyer has what it takes to control the middle period of the game like he did during the 2023 ODI World Cup.He has time and again reiterated that he is not fussy about batting positions and that flexibility will certainly come good. The England ODIs will definitely help coach Gautam Gambhir and captain Rohit Sharma to finalise composition of their middle-order, and it will make a lot of sense if it revolves around Iyer.Yes, there are plenty of right-handers in the middle-order mix at the moment but India do have some flexible left-handers in the lower-order who they can seamlessly move around as per the match situation. Those movements were on display during the three ODIs vs Sri Lanka and it could well continue in the upcoming ODI assignments.Axar Patel or Ravindra Jadeja? Or both?India picked both the left-arm spin all-rounders for the T20 World Cup but only Axar played the Sri Lanka ODIs as Jadeja was rested. The selectors now need to take that tough call because Axar did exceedingly well in the T20 World Cup and looked good in the ODIs vs Sri Lanka too. Jadeja, on the other hand, last played an ODI back in November 2023.It now remains to be seen whether the management moves on from Jadeja or carries both. It will be very difficult to ignore Axar because he lends a lot of balance to the Playing XI with his all-round abilities.All the questions will be answered in a few hours' time as the men who matter will get in a huddle to pick the squad for the multi-nation tournament.",India men's senior selection committee will pick provisional squad for Champions Trophy.

David Miller lauds Lhuan-dre Pretorius after Paarl Royals beat MI Cape Town

Dinesh Karthik on Lhuan-dre Pretorius, start for Paarl Royals in SA20

Jasprit Bumrah injury: Where things stand with BOOM!

Lhuan-dre Pretorius may be living life in the fast lane at the Paarl Royals in the SA20 , but the teenager’s dad Abe is still picking up traffic fines.Pretorius has burst on the global cricket scene in spectacular fashion with the former South Africa U-19 star smashing two half-centuries in three matches to top the SA20 run-scorers list.He has surprised many with the maturity he’s shown at the crease. Unfazed at the prospect of facing up to the likes of Trent Boult, Kagiso Rabada, Marco Jansen and Ottniel Baartman.But Abe Pretorius - Lhuan-dre’s father - claims his son is still just a normal teen finding his way in the world.“I remember when Anrich Nortje bowled to him. He told me an interesting story: ‘Dad, I wasn’t scared of the ball. I was more scared of me running into him because I saw it on TV.’ He was never afraid. Pace never bothered him,” said the senior Pretorius.“But he’s still a baby. He’s only 18. He has a mustache. But his beard is soft. He's still a kid and sometimes I forget.“But he's also not a kid getting all the speed fines. The car is still in my name. It's crazy!”The Pretorius family have certainly been there to support Lhuan-dre and fellow South African schools prodigy Vihan - ‘he’s my baby and can do no wrong’ - cricket aspirations since they first picked up a cricket bat.Abe installed a training net at their home in Potchefstroom early on and since they stayed close to Senwes Park - home of the North West Dragons - would regularly take his sons there to train.Lhuan-dre, therefore, had the privilege of spending time with the likes of SA20 stars Bjorn Fortuin and Rassie van der Dussen from a very young age.“He always wanted to play the game. He was brought up next to the field at Senwes Park. So, I was privileged to have a hospitality suite there. And that’s where he met Bjorn and Rassie.“He always played with them or next to the field to see them playing. And that's what's so nice. He plays now with Bjorn. There's a bit of banter going on between them.”At this critical age parents can often become over-indulged with their children’s sporting careers, forcing them to train when they may no longer enjoy it.Abe was never confronted with this issue.“He lives for cricket. He YouTubes cricket every night. I don’t think he’s watched a cartoon ever in his life. From a young age, before any big game, he would wake me up at five.“And we had a net in our yard at the back. So I needed to throw to him before school. And when he gets picked up and then he's ready in the afternoon.“I think more waking him up for academics. He never wanted to study. That was a headache and we had to get a tutor to assist him.”Whilst it was almost the perfect childhood growing up in Potchefstroom, the major cricket-playing high schools are based in Johannesburg. That’s close to 120 kilometres away.It is common practice for young South African boys to leave their family homes at 12-13 years old after being afforded scholarships to attend these ivy-league schools as hostel boarders.But Abe was having none of it. Instead, he packed up and relocated the entire family to “The Big Smoke” - as Johannesburg is colloquially referred to - for Lhuan-dre to attend the prestigious St Stithians College - alma mater of Kagiso Rabada, Grant Elliot and a certain Kwena Maphaka.The latter is, of course, the same age as Lhuan-dre with their cricket journeys following an almost identical path. They played together at school, youth provincial Lions teams, SA U19, and now at the Royals.And according to Abe, it's Lhuan-dre, who kept wicket for most of this period, that knows how to inspire the tearaway rookie fast bowler.“Lhuan-dre knew just how to switch Kwena on. He would always go up to Kwena and whisper something in his ear, and Kwena would get spitting mad,” he said.“After that, Kwena would run through the teams. There are a lot of video clips of when they were at school together, especially when Lhuan-dre was keeping. They were a mean team.”With Lhuan-dre being a left-handed opening batter that keeps wicket, has Gunn & Moore as his bat sponsor, and also having an aversion to a prospective academic career, the comparisons with Proteas and Durban's Super Giants star Quinton de Kock were inevitable.But according to Abe, Lhuan-dre would not want it any other way, and is looking forward to the Royals’ first clash against the Super Giants at Kingsmead on Thursday, January 23.“He’s had a photo up of Quinny since he was very young. He’s still Quinny’s biggest fan. He simply loved Quinny.“Everything about him is Quinny. Yeah, I think you're going to see when they're going to play each other. It's going to be a challenge. I think he's going to be a star-struck!""Everything is happening at the speed of light for Pretorius right now. If he maintains this early season momentum through SA20 Season 3, it would not be far too to suggest that the powerful left-hander could come into the reckoning as a potential replacement at the Indian Premier League (IPL) in the near future.So, how does a father keep a teenager in check when the whole world suddenly wants to give him everything his heart has always desired?“I'm Afrikaans!

Numbers elicit praise from likes of Sachin

NAGPUR: Ironic as it may sound, the buzzword in Indian cricket over the past weeks has been a non-cricketing term - PR. Fan wars on social media, ignited by the debacle in Australia, sparked debates on 'paid news' versus authenticity.With the debate still raging, a post on X went viral on social media on Thursday evening. "" Karun Nair has a serious shot at making it to the Indian team if he can afford hiring a PR agency for a while,"" said the post.The witty remark struck a chord, highlighting the one element missing in Nair's arsenal - a robust social media presence. But in the Vijay Hazare Trophy , it wasn't PR that spoke for him; it was his bat, loud and clear.A total of 752 runs, at an unbelievable average of 752 was enough for Nair to trend on X. Social media has been abuzz, with many urging Indian selectors to draft Nair into the Indian squad for the forthcoming England ODI series and the Champions Trophy scheduled in Pakistan and Dubai.With an unstoppable 88* off just 44 balls on Thursday, Nair, who had been knocking on the selectors' door, almost broke it in the semifinal. Coming in to bat in the 35th over, the Vidarbha skipper unleashed his magic in the final 15 balls he played in the match, stacking up 55* runs. His ball-by-ball figures read 4, 0, 4, 0, 4, 6, 6, 1, 6, 4, 0, 6, 4, 4, 6. He hit boundaries for fun and toyed with the field at will.Cricket legend Sachin Tendulkar lauded Nair's run on Friday. ""Scoring 752 runs in 7 innings with 5 centuries is nothing short of extraordinary, @karun126. Performances like these don't just happen, they come from immense focus and hard work. Keep going strong and make every opportunity count,"" he posted on X.Former Indian spinner Harbhajan Singh too was vocal on his Youtube channel, questioning the double standards of selectors. ""Different rules for different people… that shouldn't be the way. When Nair is scoring runs, you need to play him, right? He doesn't have tattoos, doesn't wear fancy clothes, is that the reason you're not picking him? Does he not work hard,"" he said.Some also drew comparisons of Nair's purple patch with that of VVS Laxman before the stylish batsman was re-drafted in the Indian squad. ""When Laxman made a comeback into the Indian team, he made a big statement with 1,400-odd runs. Nair's stupendous show should be enough for him to launch his comeback,"" a post read.Nair's super show has rewritten history books too. He now tops the list of most runs as a captain in the Vijay Hazare trophy. He is also set to finish as batsman with highest average in Vijay Hazare history.Prior to being dismissed for 112 against Uttar Pradesh, Nair had set a new List A record of scoring 542 runs without being dismissed, going past former New Zealand allrounder James Franklin","Vidarbha batsman Karun Nair scores 752 runs at an average of 752 in Vijay Hazare Trophy.

ILT20: Captain speak on media day ahead of third season

Sharjah Warriorz clinched a thrilling victory over Dubai Capitals in their first home game of the season, thanks to a stunning counter-attacking innings by Sri Lankan batter Avishka Fernando . With this win, the Warriorz have climbed to the second spot on the points table.The Sharjah Warriorz chased down the target with 5 wickets and 11 deliveries to spare , despite facing a daunting chase of 202 runs. Captain Tim Southee praised Fernando's incredible performance, especially considering he had just arrived on the morning of the match.""To chase down a score like that and that innings from Fernando was incredible. To get off the plane in the morning and do that is special. Fernando was outstanding for us,"" Southee said.Southee acknowledged that there were areas for improvement, particularly in fielding and bowling, but he was pleased with the team's depth, as several players stepped up to perform despite some being sick.Coach JP Duminy echoed Southee's sentiments, emphasising the need to work on their fielding as a collective effort. He expressed the team's desire to excel in this aspect of the game.""Fielding is an area of our game that we can work on. We try to collectively put in a big effort in the field. So, that's something we want to work on and fielding is something we want to be better at for sure,"" Duminy said.Avishka Fernando, who scored a blistering 81 off just 27 deliveries, with 8 sixes and 6 fours, credited his success to focusing on his natural game and maintaining a positive mindset while chasing a formidable target. Fernando's knock was the fastest-ever 50 in the history of the ILT20 .""Focussing on my natural game and thank the lord for today's knock. The wicket was nice to bat today, the thoughts when chasing 200 was to be positive, it came naturally and thankful for that. I did not realise that I have broken the record for the fastest-ever 50.""Coach Duminy showered praise on Fernando, commending his confidence and ability to perform despite having just joined the team. He emphasised the importance of creating an environment where players feel at ease, which is something the Sharjah Warriorz strive for.""Just the mindset that he came in with, he got off the plane last night and got introduced to the team after that. And to have the confidence to arrive and play the way he did, shows, not only his character but also his ability. And just for him to feel at ease in our environment is something we (Sharjah Warriorz) strive for, but that was certainly one of the most special knocks we have seen,"" the coach added.Duminy revealed that the team talk at the halfway stage was light-hearted, focusing on the quality of the pitch and the need to play to their abilities.

We're a better outfit than the last two games: Super Giants coach Lance Klusener

Keep improving and play some better cricket: Sunrisers' Liam Dawson

Durban's Super Giants faced another setback in the ongoing SA20 League , suffering a 58-run loss to defending champions Sunrisers Eastern Cape at Kingsmead on Friday. The defeat marked their second consecutive loss at home, leaving head coach Lance Klusener visibly disappointed with his team's performance.""We have a proud record from last season playing at home, so this is absolutely disappointing,"" Klusener said after the match. ""I think we're a better outfit than how we turned out in the last two games. While the surfaces have been challenging, that's no excuse. We lacked the aggression to take the first punch, and when you're on the back foot, it's tough to recover.""The Sunrisers, who entered the match on the back of three consecutive losses, delivered a resounding comeback. Klusener credited their sharpness and determination. ""They came in with three losses, so for them to bounce back the way they did was outstanding. They were running well between the wickets, and we all know how well they field. Sometimes it's the small things that make the big difference.""The Super Giants' batting woes continued to be a concern, with the team failing to capitalise on starts. ""It's not about the batting quality; we have outstanding batters. The problem lies in not building partnerships or capitalising on starts. This evening that surface was tough to make a comeback against some quality spin,"" Klusener explained.Noor Ahmad was the standout performer for Super Giants, taking 4 for 25. Klusener praised his former Afghanistan players, Ahmad and Naveen-ul-Haq , the latter finishing with 1 for 44. ""Noor has been an outstanding performer for a few years now. He bowls at a good pace, making it tough to pick him through the air. That's his strength. Naveen is quality too - most wickets in T20s last year. It's great to see them both step up.""Looking ahead, Klusener emphasised the need for self-reflection. ""We need to focus on ourselves rather than worrying too much about the opposition. The way we batted, especially without building partnerships, needs to change. While our bowling is in a better place, we need to score more runs to be competitive,"" he said.Meanwhile, Sunrisers Eastern Cape finally broke their losing streak in the SA20 season with the big win. The defending champions, who had struggled in their first three matches, delivered a performance that Liam Dawson described as crucial for their campaign.""It was a very important win. We know how good they are, especially at home,"" Dawson remarked in the post-match press conference. ""They've got two quality spinners in Noor Ahmed and Keshav Maharaj. So we knew it was going to be tough coming here and getting a win. As a group, we’ve been honest with ourselves—we haven’t played to our potential at all yet in this tournament. This was a massive game for us, and we’re very, very happy to get the win.""Dawson highlighted the team’s resolve to use this victory as a turning point. ""Without doubt, we’d love this to be the catalyst for more winning performances and points on the board. We know we’ve been below our standards in the first three or four games. We’ve got to come back Sunday and try to produce another good performance against a very strong side,"" he said.Acknowledging the competitive nature of the SA20 League, Dawson stressed the need for continuous improvement. ""Every team is strong in this competition. We won’t take this win for granted at all. There’s a lot we need to improve on as a group. The focus is on keeping the momentum and playing better cricket,"" he added.",Durban's Super Giants lost 58-run to Sunrisers Eastern Cape at Kingsmead.

What does the horoscope of struggling Prithvi Shaw say?

Former India cricketer Aakash Chopra has expressed surprise over the BCCI 's decision to enforce mandatory travel rules for players, requiring them to travel together with the team for matches and practice sessions. Speaking on his YouTube channel, Chopra questioned the necessity of such a regulation and suggested it might have been introduced due to prior misuse.""Players cannot travel separately with families. All players are expected to travel with the team to and from matches and practice sessions. I am extremely surprised by this rule. Going for practice or the match is with the team only,"" Chopra said. ""This has been happening forever. If someone wants to practice more, they request the coach. But has someone been leaving early? Some abuse must have happened; that's why this rule is being enforced,"" he added.The BCCI's decision follows a review meeting held after India's 1-3 loss to Australia in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy, attended by captain Rohit Sharma , head coach Gautam Gambhir , and chief selector Ajit Agarkar Referencing recent incidents, Chopra clarified that isolated lapses, like Yashasvi Jaiswal reportedly arriving late to a session, do not reflect a widespread issue. ""I am pretty sure everyone wouldn't have been flouting the rule. Yashasvi Jaiswal couldn't reach recently, and he got punished for being late. That's a different story,"" he explained.Chopra also highlighted the importance of accountability for those who might have allowed exceptions in the past. ""If someone claims they don't need to travel with the team because they're staying elsewhere or it's their city, then whoever permitted this should be called out,"" he asserted.The new rule requires players seeking to travel separately to obtain permission from both the head coach and the chairman of selectors. While acknowledging that such regulations might feel overly strict, Chopra remarked, ""Such things are bound to happen if rules are abused.""",Aakash Chopra has expressed surprise over the BCCI's decision to enforce mandatory travel rules for players.

Axar Patel hints at flexible middle-order ahead of England T20I series

Former India captain Sourav Ganguly has dismissed concerns about Virat Kohli 's recent slump in form, hailing him as the ""greatest white-ball player"" and a ""once-in-a-lifetime cricketer.""Despite Kohli's impressive century in the first Test of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy in Perth, he struggled in the subsequent innings, scoring only 85 runs in the next seven innings.India's senior players, including Kohli and captain Rohit Sharma , failed to deliver, resulting in a 1-3 series loss to Australia.""Virat Kohli is a once-in-a-lifetime cricketer. To score 81 international centuries in a career is something unbelievable. For me, he's probably the greatest white-ball player the world has seen,"" Ganguly said during a Cricket Association of Bengal ( CAB )felicitation programme for the state's players.Ganguly expressed surprise at Kohli's inability to build on his Perth century throughout the remainder of the series.""I was really surprised the way he batted after getting a 100 in Perth. He struggled before that but I thought after the 100 in Perth, it'll be a big series for him.""""But I think it happens. Every player has his weakness and strength. You know, there's no player in the world, who will not have that. It's how you adapt to your weaknesses as you play great bowlers over a period of time.""Ganguly remains confident that Kohli will regain his form in the upcoming three-match ODI series against England and the subsequent Champions Trophy.""He will score runs in this tournament in Indian conditions, and I still feel there's a lot of cricket left in Virat Kohli, the tour of England will be a big challenge for him.""""I'm not too worried about his form in the Champions Trophy, because as I said, he's probably the best white-ball player the world has seen for a long period of time.""Ganguly also believes that India will be one of the favourites in the Champions Trophy, citing their recent success in the 2023 ODI World Cup, where they finished as runners-up, and their unbeaten run to the T20 World Cup title last year.""I know India did not have a great series in Australia, but if you look at the last two World Cups, the T20 World Cup India won it unbeaten, and the 50-over World Cup India lost their final.""""So if you look at India's performance in the last two World Cups, they've just lost one game, in almost about 20 of them. So, I think it's a phenomenal white ball team. For me, they will be the favourites in the Champions Trophy.""Ganguly also backed Indian skipper Rohit Sharma to bounce back in the Champions Trophy.""Rohit Sharma in white-ball cricket is phenomenal, and you will see a different Rohit Sharma once the Champions Trophy starts. And as I said, they (India) will be one of the contenders in the tournament.""However, Ganguly stressed that India needs to improve their Test cricket performance, especially with their upcoming series in England this summer.""Come England in July, they'll have to really work hard to play well there because the conditions are different. The red ball and the seaming, swinging pitches, they'll have to bat a bit better than what they have done.""""I've always said that if you score 350 to 400 runs in first innings of Test matches away from home, you get yourself in a position to win Test matches.""""Now if you're getting out for less than 200, then you're always fighting from behind. And the reason they won in Perth is because they got 400-500 runs on the board in second innings.""Ganguly expressed delight at seeing pacer Mohammed Shami return to full fitness after a lengthy injury layoff.""I'm happy to see Shami fit because I think he's probably the best bowler after (Jasprit) Bumrah in the country.""""I know he'll be a bit nervous because he's playing cricket after a long time, especially with a knee injury, but the good thing is that he bowled a lot for Bengal in the domestic cricket, which is going to help him in the games to come.""Shami is set to make his international comeback in the first T20I against England on Wednesday.Ganguly also endorsed Shami's return to Test cricket, emphasizing his importance to the team's success.""He's as good as anybody in the world. Shami and Bumrah bowling at two ends is different than Bumrah bowling from one end. Both players are vital to each other's success in Test cricket.""Amid the criticism faced by Team India following their loss to Australia, Ganguly highlighted the significance of focusing on performance and maintaining a strong mindset.""There's so much at stake with sport these days, and there will be negativity and opinions. As an athlete, you need to find a way to keep yourself out of it.""","Former India captain Sourav Ganguly has dismissed concerns about Virat Kohli's recent slump in form.

Axar Patel hints at flexible middle-order ahead of England T20I series

NEW DELHI: England's head coach, Brendon McCullum , known for revolutionising Test cricket with his ultra-aggressive 'Bazball' approach, surprised many on Monday by declaring that England will adopt a ""watchful style of cricket"" in the upcoming limited-overs series against India.This marks McCullum's debut in charge of England's white-ball squad, having achieved remarkable success as their Test coach since May 2022. The five-match T20I series kicks off on Wednesday at Eden Gardens in Kolkata, followed by three ODIs.""I know it's going to be a tough tour, taking on a very good Indian side, but I'm sure we'll play what I hope is a very watchful style of cricket,"" McCullum said during a media interaction in Kolkata.The ODI series is seen as a critical preparatory phase for both teams ahead of the ICC Champions Trophy, scheduled to take place in Pakistan and Dubai from February 19.""We'll use the next few weeks to hit the ground running. There will be times when we don’t quite get it right, but hopefully, we can work through that and be in top shape for the Champions Trophy,"" he added.McCullum, who succeeded Matthew Mott as England's white-ball coach in September, is now balancing dual roles as both Test and limited-overs coach. Despite England’s reputation for power-hitting, McCullum stressed the need to adapt to Indian conditions and leverage their diverse resources.""You won't win every game, but it's about getting the best out of the talent we have, gelling the guys together, and finding complementary skills,"" McCullum noted.England boasts a formidable lineup, with explosive batters, sharp fielders, world-class spinners, and a pace attack capable of unsettling any opponent. McCullum emphasized the importance of blending these strengths effectively to maximize their chances.Skipper Jos Buttler , who led England to the T20 World Cup title in 2022 and was part of their 2019 ODI World Cup-winning squad, has faced challenges in maintaining the team’s dominance in recent months. McCullum, however, expressed full confidence in Buttler’s leadership.""Jos is excited about the team and the opportunities ahead.

Champions Trophy Squad: Chief selector Ajit Agarkar and skipper Rohit Sharma PC

MUMBAI: At a time when Test cricket continues to face existential questions in the face of an onslaught of T20 leagues, former India batsman-turned commentator Sanjay Manjrekar feels that it is actually T20 cricket and the cash-rich IPL that could help preserve the game’s traditional format, which he compared to a “heritage structure” by providing the funds to sustain it.“It’s something that we have to make peace with. Test cricket will be like one of these heritage structures like your (Mumbai Police) offices and the CST Railway station, now where the other formats, especially T20 cricket and the IPL, will have to keep a fund aside to keep Test cricket alive like we do a heritage structure,” Manjrekar said on Monday at the prize distribution function of the Police Shield at the Police Gymkhana, where he was chief guest on the occasion.It emerged in July last year that the International Cricket Council (ICC) is mulling a dedicated fund of at least $15 million for Test cricket that will help increase the players' match fee and address the migration of talent to lucrative T20 franchise leagues. In July 2023, the e Marylebone Cricket Club’s (MCC) World Cricket Committee (WCC) has proposed the creation of strategic funds to foster the growth and development of Test and women's cricket.It’s understandable why Test cricket has a special place in Manjrekar’s heart. Known as a technically correct batsman, the 59-year-old scored 2043 runs in 37 Tests@37.14, with four hundreds and nine fifties in the 90s. He feels that people value and tend to remember performances in Test cricket, compared to those in T20s.“There is also some motivation to do that because if you remember the India-Australia series, if you ask anyone here, even the younger players, they will know exactly what happened in that series. So, (there’s) something about Test cricket…Maybe people don’t watch every ball, but they remember what happened in a Test match. The results, the performances resonate much longer than you would think in a T20 game, where you see great performances, but like the format, the effects of that performance is also for a very short time,” he said.Manjrekar told the gathering of cricketers present on the occasion that while Test cricket won't help them achieve a “huge bank balance,” performances in it would give “you some genuine respect from your fellow cricketers and peers.”“There’s no harm in excellence of any kind. If you seek 50-over, or T20 excellence, that’s fine too. And anyone who has special fondness for Test cricket, remember one thing. You may not make as much money, and won’t have a huge bank balance, but you’ll have some genuine respect as a performer from your fellow cricketers and peers. So, if that’s important to you maybe that is the motivation to play Test cricket (for you),” he asserted.",Former India batsman-turned commentator Sanjay Manjrekar feels that T20 cricket and the IPL could help preserve the game’s traditional format. The International Cricket Council (ICC) is mulling a dedicated fund of at least $15 million for Test cricket that will help increase the players' match fee.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117403259,imgsize-20914,width-400,resizemode-4/117403259.jpg"

It was tough because we were in such a tough position early on.""The Super Giants now head back home to Kingsmead for two crucial home matches against MI Cape Town (Tuesday) and Paarl Royals (Thursday).Both Western Cape teams are in form with MI Cape Town heading the table on 14 points with the Royals just two points behind them in second place.Williamson is backing Klaasen to rediscover his form in these two crucial matches for the Super Giants.""He is clearly the best (white-ball) player in the world in my eyes,"" the former New Zealand captain said.""But on some tricky surfaces it is just about complimenting each other as a unit. We know what damage he can do, so we are just trying to use him as best we can.""Williamson also stressed that now is not the time for the Super Giants to retreat and start playing a conservative brand of cricket.""There is a lot of experience in that dressing room and all of us have been in this situation before. And the games come thick and fast. It is just about keeping coming back to the basics and not over-reacting. There are a lot of fantastic players in that dressing room and it's about doing it collectively,"" he said.""Naturally, every game there is the intention to win, but for us is to make those improvements and get nice and clear. Often after a few losses those things are highlighted, it is important for us to play with that freedom and trust the quality in the dressing room.

Axar Patel hints at flexible middle-order ahead of England T20I series

Champions Trophy Squad: Chief selector Ajit Agarkar and skipper Rohit Sharma PC

NEW DELHI: England coach Brendon McCullum on Monday praised India head coach Gautam Gambhir as a ""strong leader of men"" and expressed confidence in his ability to lead India to success in the near future.Gambhir, who took charge as India's head coach across all formats following the team's title-winning campaign in the T20 World Cup last year, has faced significant criticism after India’s poor performances against New Zealand and Australia.However, McCullum, who previously worked with Gambhir during their time together at Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR), voiced his support for his former teammate.""I’ve worked with Gautam before, and I can say he’s an outstanding leader. He’s a really strong leader of men, and in every leadership position he’s held, he has excelled,"" McCullum told reporters in Kolkata.""He’s only just started in this role, but I have no doubt he’ll bring the best out of the talent at his disposal. It’s up to us (England) to find a way to counter his team’s approach with our own style,"" McCullum added.India recently endured a 0-3 whitewash at home against New Zealand and suffered a 1-3 loss to Australia in an away series, derailing their hopes of qualifying for a third consecutive World Test Championship (WTC) final.Gambhir’s tenure also began with India losing a bilateral ODI series to Sri Lanka for the first time in 27 years last August.Despite these setbacks, India secured a series victory against Bangladesh at home under Gambhir's leadership. Throughout his tenure, Gambhir has consistently opposed the ""star culture"" in Indian cricket, prompting the BCCI to introduce a 10-point guideline to promote team unity and accountability.However, his coaching methods have drawn criticism, especially after India lost six of 10 Tests and the ODI series against Sri Lanka under his guidance.Addressing coaching philosophies, McCullum shared his perspective on the varied approaches coaches adopt.""I don’t even know if 'coach' is the right word sometimes,"" McCullum remarked. ""Everyone has their own unique approach to the role.""Explaining his own coaching philosophy, McCullum emphasized the importance of fostering a positive environment.""For me, it’s less about coaching in a traditional sense and more about creating a happy, enjoyable environment where players feel encouraged to push their limits and embrace uncomfortable situations,"" he said.McCullum added that different coaches adopt diverse methods, with some preferring a structured, technical approach, while others operate in a more regimented manner.""It really depends on the individual coach and their style,"" he concluded.McCullum is currently in India with the England team for the upcoming limited-overs series, where his players will face Gambhir's side in what promises to be an exciting contest.",England coach Brendon McCullum praises India head coach Gautam Gambhir.

Axar Patel hints at flexible middle-order ahead of England T20I series

NEW DELHI: Newly-appointed Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) skipper Rishabh Pant has credited India captain Rohit Sharma , along with other senior players, for shaping his leadership skills.As LSG begins a new chapter, the franchise has placed its faith in Pant, renowned for his fearless batting and commanding presence on the field.Pant, who made his international debut under Virat Kohli in 2017, has also had the privilege of playing alongside the iconic Mahendra Singh Dhoni . Reflecting on his journey, Pant emphasized the value of learning from various leaders.""Yes, I've learned from a lot of captains and many senior players because I believe leadership lessons are not confined to captains alone,"" Pant said after being named LSG captain. ""There’s so much to gain from experienced players and the way they approach the evolving game.""Pant particularly highlighted the influence of Rohit, noting the importance of care and trust in leadership.""With Rohit bhai, I’ve learned how to care for a player, and that resonates with my own philosophy as a captain,"" he explained. ""When you give confidence and trust to a player, he can achieve things beyond imagination for the team.""Pant, who became the most expensive player in IPL history when LSG acquired him for Rs 27 crore, shared his vision for the team.""We’ll back the players, instill trust, and maintain clear communication,"" said Pant, who has previous captaincy experience with Delhi Capitals (DC).Last season, Pant led DC with determination, scoring 446 runs to emerge as the team’s top scorer. However, the franchise fell short of expectations, finishing sixth and missing the playoffs.Pant stressed the importance of fostering a ""never-say-die"" attitude within the LSG squad.""Performance may come and go, but what matters is your fight. Are you giving 100% on the field? Everyone gets tired, but it’s about pushing that extra 20-30% for the team. That’s the culture we want to build.""The 25-year-old will also reunite with former India pace legend Zaheer Khan , who mentored him during his IPL debut in 2016. Zaheer now takes on the role of LSG mentor, succeeding Gautam Gambhir.As LSG embarks on this new journey under Pant’s leadership, his vision of trust, resilience, and character promises to shape a team ready to fight till the last ball.","Rishabh Pant has been named the new captain of Lucknow Super Giants.

NEW DELHI: Rishi Kapoor , the first Delhi footballer to win a national football league title, passed away in a city hospital on Monday. He was 49 and had reportedly been suffering from liver-related issues.Primarily a left-footed midfielder with fine passing ability and a thunderous shot, Kapoor spearheaded Hindustan FC ’s rise in Delhi’s football of the late 1990s and early 2000s, his ability and time on the ball was good enough to catch the attention of the big clubs in the then National Football League and later, the I-League .At a time when the Capital’s footballers were mostly semi-professional and rare on the national clubs’ scene, in 2000, Rishi left to join ITI in Bangalore with ambitions to play in the NFL. Already employed with Delhi Audit , and with ITI mainly an institutional team but times changing in Indian football then, he was one of the first players to be signed on contract by the Bangalore outfit as it rejigged its rules to allow for two outstation players, or ‘guest players’ as they were officially labelled under.It was here that a tweak was made to his positional nature that would immediately further his prospects as a footballer. Partly due to a crowded midfield at ITI, and largely due to his left-footed passing and fondness for playing from the deep, Rishi was converted into a defender at left-back. It may have stifled a bit of his creativity, but his game-reading lent solidity to the defence. His performances at ITI led to Mohun Bagan taking notice.“We’ve lost a very good player today. This is no time to go,” Debjit Ghosh, teammate when Bagan won the title in 2002, told TOI from Kolkata. “When we first saw him at ITI, he was playing as left-back and he really impressed our coach, Subrata Bhattacharya. Much later after we signed him, we realized that he was a natural playmaker, but we needed him in defence. He and I struck up a very fine understanding on the field,” said the ex-India player.Despite a national title and the promise of further professional exposure, Rishi left Bagan to return to Delhi’s Hindustan. “He stayed just one season with us. He wanted to return to keep his job,” remembered Ghosh. It was perhaps this mindset – of saving the job -- that probably cost the Delhi footballer an India call-up. Stephen Constantine, the then India coach, was impressed by Kapoor’s versatility on the left channel, but chose to ignore him because he rightly felt that Delhi’s football didn’t offer a high level of intensity and competitiveness.With his job safe, Kapoor enjoyed brief stints with Salgaocar and Sesa in Goa but always returned to establish himself as an Ambedkar Stadium fixture. A decade later, after his first move, as Delhi football would change character, moving away from the Walled City into the suburbs, Rishi Kapoor would be the symbol of change. Playing for newly-formed Delhi United, he would toy with much-younger footballers, effortlessly doing it even at 35.","Rishi Kapoor, the first Delhi footballer to win a national football league title, passed away in a city hospital on Monday.

""Today he put his mark on the game.""Liverpool also have a game in hand over the injury-hit Arsenal, whose title hopes took another blow at the Emirates Stadium.Gabriel Martinelli's effort crossed the line despite Emi Martinez's efforts, giving Arsenal a deserved first-half lead.Kai Havertz's shot also found the back of the net, despite Martinez getting a touch on it.However, Villa staged a comeback through Youri Tielemans' header, and the Belgian midfielder nearly leveled the score moments later when his shot hit the post.Ollie Watkins equalised for the visitors 22 minutes from time, cushioning in Matty Cash's cross off the underside of the crossbar.""Today we cannot concede the two goals we did after everything we did,"" said Arteta.

Griezmann blows penalty

Barcelona were held to a 1-1 draw by Getafe in La Liga on Saturday, failing to make up ground on the top two teams in the Spanish title race.Jules Kounde gave Barcelona an early lead, but Mauro Arambarri equalised for Getafe in the first half, and the Catalans were unable to break down Jose Bordalas' well-organised team.The draw leaves Barcelona in third place, five points behind league leaders Atletico Madrid, who suffered a 1-0 defeat at Leganes earlier in the day.Despite winning the Spanish Super Cup last week and thrashing Real Betis in the Copa del Rey, suggesting a return to form after a slump in late 2024, Barcelona dropped two points on the road in their first league match of 2025 against 16th-placed Getafe.""It's not done yet, we still have some matches to play and as I said before, we will fight until the end,"" Flick told reporters.""Today it's one point more, not two points less. We missed (out on) two points, but we have to look forwards and make it better next time.""Flick fielded his strongest side in recent weeks, hoping to secure a result at Getafe, where Barcelona had failed to score in their previous four away visits.The Blaugrana ended that streak in the ninth minute when Kounde, who also scored in the midweek Copa del Rey win against Real Betis, was cleverly set up by Pedri and scored on the rebound after David Soria saved his initial effort.However, Barcelona faced the same difficulties they have often encountered at the Coliseum, with Getafe digging in and denying top scorer Robert Lewandowski any space.Getafe equalized in the 34th minute when Coba's shot was parried by Barcelona goalkeeper Inaki Pena, and Arambarri pounced to score.The hosts maintained their tight defensive setup in the second half, making life difficult for Barcelona.Raphinha missed a golden opportunity to win the game for Barca in the closing minutes, hitting the side netting from close range after being found by Lamine Yamal's cross.""It was a shame, the match, we had control of the game and with one chance they scored one goal against us, it's a shame,"" Kounde told Movistar.After the match, Barcelona defender Alejandro Balde reported being subjected to racist abuse from some home supporters during the first half.On Sunday, Spanish and European champions Real Madrid, currently second in La Liga, host Las Palmas with the aim of moving to the top of the table.In another surprise result, league leaders Atletico Madrid suffered a shock defeat at Leganes, ending their club record run of 15 consecutive victories.Matija Nastasic headed Leganes in front early in the second half, and Antoine Griezmann missed a late penalty, dragging his effort wide, as Atletico fell to their second league defeat of the season.""I thought we were low on energy, it wasn't enough from us,"" Atletico goalkeeper Jan Oblak told DAZN.""We'll keep our head up after (winning) 15 games, we lost this one and we have to keep going forwards... unfortunately the streak is over.""Leganes, 15th in the table, defended well to keep Atletico at bay in the first half, with Julian Alvarez and Griezmann hitting the woodwork.Nastasic's header from a corner put Leganes ahead early in the second half, and they protected their lead without much trouble until controversially conceding a penalty for a debatable handball by Sergio Gonzalez.Griezmann took responsibility from the spot but rolled his 90th-minute effort wide of the goal.Atletico must now regroup in the Champions League, where they aim to reach the knockout rounds, as they face Bayer Leverkusen on Tuesday.""They were 15 extraordinary games, I feel enormously proud at having set the (consecutive) winning record in Atletico's history,"" Atletico coach Diego Simeone told DAZN.""We have to accept that defeat is part of the game and prepare ourselves for Tuesday.""","Barcelona held to a 1-1 draw by Getafe in La Liga on Saturday.

NEW DELHI: Darwin Nunez delivered a late heroics to fire Liverpool back into Premier League title contention with a dramatic stoppage-time brace, securing a hard-fought 2-0 victory over Brentford at the Gtech Community Stadium on Saturday.Liverpool entered the match desperate to end a run of two consecutive league draws, and Nunez, who had struggled for form with just four goals in 26 appearances this season, emerged as the unlikely hero. The Uruguayan's double lifted the Reds seven points clear of second-placed Arsenal, though the Gunners have an opportunity to close the gap with a win over Aston Villa later in the day.The result provided a massive boost to Arne Slot ’s side, who remain in control of their title destiny with a game in hand. It also marked Liverpool’s first league win in three games, after a series of disappointing results that included a draw against Nottingham Forest and a League Cup semi-final first-leg defeat to Tottenham.Brentford, boasting the joint-best home record in the Premier League, made life difficult for the visitors early on. The Bees nearly took the lead when Mikkel Damsgaard failed to convert Mads Roerslev's inviting ball across the six-yard box. Bryan Mbeumo also tested Alisson Becker with a fierce drive from the edge of the area.Liverpool, meanwhile, created a host of chances but were thwarted by Brentford’s resilient defense and in-form goalkeeper Mark Flekken. Dominik Szoboszlai came agonizingly close to breaking the deadlock, smashing a 25-yard strike against the crossbar, while Cody Gakpo and Luis Diaz both missed opportunities to find the net.In the second half, Brentford continued to threaten on the counter, with Alisson twice denying Mbeumo and Nathan Collins making a crucial goal-line clearance to keep Salah's deflected shot out.With time running out and frustration building, Slot turned to Nunez, bringing him on alongside Andrew Robertson. The move paid off spectacularly in stoppage time. Trent Alexander-Arnold delivered a pinpoint cross, and Nunez calmly slotted home from close range, sparking wild celebrations on the Liverpool bench.Moments later, Nunez struck again, this time latching onto Harvey Elliott’s perfectly weighted pass and rifling a fierce shot past Flekken to seal the win. The Uruguayan’s decisive contributions silenced his critics and ensured Liverpool stayed firmly in the title race.For Brentford, the defeat marked a missed opportunity to capitalize on Liverpool's recent struggles. Thomas Frank's men, who had shown resilience in their 2-2 draw with Manchester City earlier in the week, were left to rue missed chances and late lapses in concentration.Liverpool’s victory not only ended their mini-slump but also sent a statement to their title rivals. With Nunez rediscovering his scoring touch, the Reds are primed for a strong push in the second half of the season.",Darwin Nunez scores stoppage-time brace as Liverpool beat Brentford 2-0.

NEW DELHI: Justin Kluivert delivered a sensational performance with a hat-trick as Bournemouth ended Newcastle 's winning streak in emphatic fashion, securing a dominant 4-1 victory at St. James’ Park on Saturday.The result propelled Bournemouth into the Premier League 's top six while halting Newcastle’s bid for a club-record 10th consecutive win across all competitions.The Cherries, now unbeaten in 11 matches, stunned the Magpies with their relentless energy and clinical finishing. Kluivert, the son of former Newcastle striker Patrick Kluivert , stole the spotlight before Milos Kerkez added the finishing touch with a late fourth goal in stoppage time.Newcastle, still in fourth place, saw their cushion over Bournemouth in the race for a Champions League spot shrink to just one point. The defeat also ended Alexander Isak’s remarkable scoring streak, as the Swedish striker, who had scored in eight consecutive Premier League games, was effectively neutralized by Bournemouth's resolute defense.Andoni Iraola’s Bournemouth started brightly, dominating from the first whistle. They nearly went ahead in the opening minutes when Dango Ouattara’s shot was saved by Martin Dubravka, and Antoine Semenyo blasted the rebound over the bar. Just two minutes later, they found the breakthrough as Semenyo’s cut-back was clinically swept into the far corner by Kluivert.Though Newcastle managed to briefly equalize through Bruno Guimarães, who headed in Lewis Hall’s corner, Bournemouth restored their lead before halftime. Kluivert doubled his tally with a composed finish from Ouattara’s precise pass, leaving the hosts reeling.The second half saw Bournemouth continue to dominate, with chances falling their way. Ouattara had a goal disallowed following a VAR review, and David Brooks was denied by a combination of Dubravka and the post.Unlike their midweek disappointment against Chelsea, where they conceded a stoppage-time equalizer, Bournemouth ensured there would be no repeat this time.Kluivert completed his hat-trick with a stunning strike from outside the box, marking his second treble of the season—though this one was particularly special as all three goals came from open play, unlike his hat-trick of penalties against Wolves in November.Milos Kerkez then capped off the victory in style, drilling home Bournemouth’s fourth. The 19-year-old Hungarian left-back, rumored to be on the radar of Liverpool and Manchester United, added insult to injury for Newcastle with his impressive strike.The defeat marked a humbling afternoon for Eddie Howe’s men, who were thoroughly outplayed in front of their home crowd. Meanwhile, Bournemouth’s stunning form continues to raise expectations as they make a push for European football.",Justin Kluivert scores hat-trick as Bournemouth beat Newcastle 4-1 at St. James' Park.

NEW DELHI: Manchester City star Erling Haaland on Friday signed a new contract with the Premier League champions that will keep him at the club until 2034.City announced the nine and a half year extension for the 24-year-old striker, who has netted an impressive 111 goals in 126 matches since his arrival from Borussia Dortmund in 2022.The extension marks the longest contract in the league's history, surpassing the nine-year agreement Cole Palmer signed with Chelsea last year. Haaland’s salary is reportedly set at £500,000 ($610,000) per week.Haaland, who joined City in 2022, made an immediate impact by scoring 52 goals across all competitions in his debut season. His stellar performances helped the club secure a historic treble, winning the Champions League, Premier League, and FA Cup. He continued his remarkable form last season, netting 38 goals and contributing to the team’s fourth consecutive league title.""I am really happy to have signed my new contract and to be able to look forward to spending even more time at this great club,"" said a joyous Haaland.""Manchester City is a special club, full of fantastic people with amazing supporters, and it's the type of environment that helps bring the best out of everybody.""I also want to thank Pep (Guardiola), his coaching staff, my team-mates and everyone at the club as they have all helped me so much in the past couple of years.

NEW DELHI: Amad Diallo's remarkable 12-minute hat-trick rescued Manchester United from a potentially embarrassing defeat against struggling Southampton at Old Trafford on Thursday.The visitors, who are battling to avoid finishing the season as the worst team in Premier League history, took a deserved lead through Manuel Ugarte's own goal late in the first half.Southampton had numerous opportunities to extend their advantage, with Ivan Juric's side playing with confidence and intensity. However, Diallo's introduction in the second half proved to be a game-changer for the hosts.The young forward equalised in the 82nd minute, capitalising on a defensive lapse to score his first goal. Eight minutes later, he latched onto a clever pass from Christian Eriksen to put United ahead.Deep into stoppage time, Diallo completed his hat-trick, taking advantage of another defensive mistake from the visitors.The 3-1 victory provided a much-needed boost for Manchester United, who had endured three consecutive Premier League defeats prior to this match.It also lifted them to 12th in the table, while Southampton remained 10 points adrift of safety.Despite the eventual scoreline, Southampton's performance was commendable, as they caused numerous problems for United's defence throughout the match.Kamaldeen Sulemana was particularly impressive, tormenting the home side's right-back with his pace and trickery.Ruben Amorim's decision to introduce Diallo and make other attacking substitutions proved to be a masterstroke, as the forward's clinical finishing ultimately secured all three points for Manchester United in a match that appeared to be slipping away from them.","Manchester United beat Southampton 3-1 at Old Trafford on Thursday.

NEW DELHI: Real Madrid overcame a challenging match against Celta Vigo , initially squandering a two-goal lead but ultimately securing a 5-2 victory after extra time in the Copa del Rey quarter-finals on Thursday.Despite a recent defeat to Barcelona in the Supercopa de España final, Madrid's performance, highlighted by two goals from promising talent Endrick , saw them through after a tense match that extended beyond regular time due to Celta Vigo's late equalizer. Kylian Mbappe 's notable performance included a controversial opening goal, followed by Vinicius contributing to Madrid's lead.However, Celta Vigo's persistence paid off with Jonathan Bamba's late goal and Marcos Alonso 's penalty in stoppage time, pushing the game into extra time.In the additional period, Madrid displayed their offensive strength with Endrick scoring his second, Fede Valverde adding another, and Endrick sealing the win with a backheel goal.""This is Madrid, you fight until the end to win,"" said Endrick. ""We never go down, we're always fighting... it was a tough game, but we got the goals and we won.

NEW DELHI: Brazilian football star Neymar jr recently shared his perspective on the dynamics within the Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) team during his time there.In a podcast hosted by Romário, a Brazilian World Cup winner, Neymar discussed the impact of Lionel Messi's arrival at the club in August 2021.According to Neymar, his former teammate Kylian Mbappé became ""a little jealous"" after Messi joined the team. Neymar suggested that Mbappé, who has since joined Real Madrid, didn't want to share the spotlight with anyone else, leading to some conflicts and a change in behaviour.“No, he is not. I have my things with him, we had a little fight, but he was fundamental for us when he arrived. I used to call him golden boy. I always played with him, said he was going to be one of the best. I always helped, talked to him, he came to my place, we had dinner together,” Neymar said.Neymar acknowledged that he had a good partnership with Mbappé initially, referring to him as the ""golden boy"" and praising his potential to become one of the best players.“We had some good years of partnership, but after Messi came he was a little jealous. He didn't want to split me with anyone. And then there were some fights, a change in behavior,” the Brazilian further added.While Neymar didn't explicitly name individuals, he mentioned that big egos within the team often hindered their performances in crucial matches.“It is good to have egos, but you have to know that you don't play alone. There needs to be another guy by your side. (Big) egos were almost everywhere, it can't work,” Neymar said. “If nobody runs and nobody helps, it is impossible to win anything.”Neymar also reflected on the possibility of returning to Brazil after his contract with Al-Hilal in Saudi Arabia expires later this year.It's worth noting that neither Mbappé nor Messi has responded to Neymar's comments as of now.","Neymar discussed the impact of Lionel Messi's arrival at Paris Saint-Germain.

Barcelona advanced to the quarter-finals of the Copa del Rey with a resounding 5-1 victory over Real Betis on Wednesday. The star of the show was 17-year-old Lamine Yamal , who put on a dazzling display at the Olympic Stadium.Gavi opened the scoring for Barcelona early in the match, and the Catalans continued to dominate with goals from Jules Kounde, Raphinha, Ferran Torres, and Yamal himself. The young winger's performance was particularly impressive, as he scored and helped create two more goals.Barcelona's confidence was high coming into the match, having recently won the Spanish Super Cup in Saudi Arabia by thrashing Real Madrid. Despite resting key players like Robert Lewandowski, the team's attacking prowess was on full display.Pau Cubarsi, a 17-year-old defender who came through Barcelona's youth academy alongside Yamal, praised his teammate's performance.""I've been enjoying watching him for many years, now the whole world is, and he deserves it all.""Barcelona's dominance was evident from the start, with Dani Olmo, who recently obtained a temporary playing license, starting as a false nine in place of Lewandowski. Olmo was involved in the opening goal and had several chances of his own, hitting the post and firing over.Kounde scored Barcelona's second goal after a sublime pass from Yamal, exploiting the right side of Betis' defense. Although Kounde had a second goal disallowed for a marginal offside, Barcelona continued to create chances.In the second half, Yamal had a goal of his own disallowed for an offside in the build-up, but it didn't matter as Raphinha scored minutes later after another surging run from the young winger. Ferran Torres added a fourth goal, and Yamal finally got on the scoresheet himself with a near-post finish.Betis managed to pull one back from the penalty spot through Vitor Roque, who is on loan from Barcelona, after Kounde fouled Jesus Rodriguez in the area.After the game, Gavi praised Yamal as the best player in the world after Lionel Messi, and coach Hansi Flick also commended the winger's talent.""Gavi's very emotional, so I say also yes (he's the best),"" joked Flick.""You can see it, in great matches you see big talent and he showed it many many times, he's on a good (path).""Yamal, who shone for Spain during their Euro 2024 victory last summer, has an impressive tally of nine goals and 13 assists across all competitions for Barcelona this season.In other Copa del Rey action, Atletico Madrid joined Barcelona in the last eight with a comfortable 4-0 win over second division Elche. This marked Atletico's 15th consecutive victory across all competitions.Atletico coach Diego Simeone rested some of his regular starters, but the team still managed to secure a commanding win. Alexander Sorloth scored twice in the first half, and Elche's chances of a comeback were further diminished when Nico Fernandez was sent off early in the second half.Rodrigo Riquelme and Julian Alvarez added to Atletico's lead, sealing an emphatic victory for the Rojiblancos.The Copa del Rey action continues on Thursday, with defending league champions Real Madrid hosting Celta Vigo and cup holders Athletic Bilbao welcoming Osasuna.","Barcelona defeated Real Betis 5-1 in the Copa del Rey on Wednesday.

MELBOURNE : Jannik Sinner was staring at breakpoint early in the third set of his Australian Open fourth-round contest. The clash of young guns – Sinner versus Holger Rune – was threatening to change courses.In hot, humid conditions, Rune, the 21-year-old 13th-seed, had weighed in emphatically, splitting sets and the two games played in the third set. The Rod Laver Arena was on the edge.Sinner, the defending champion, looked out for the count, his legs were slow and he was gasping for air while Rune appeared to have more miles on his wheels than he had exhausted in the first two-hours of the contest.It all finally came to be in a classic 37-shot rally at 30-40 in the third game of the third set that was a combination of audacious shot-making and sticky reserves, they pulled each other around the court, shifting from defence to offence like it was notes on a keyboard, while bleeding every bit of reserve. Then just when it looked like the Italian had nothing more to give he plucked the ball out of the early evening air and drilled a cross court winner.The chair umpire called deuce and both men doubled over. After what seemed like an eternity, Rune looked across the net to see where his opponent was.In Sinner’s courtside box Darren Cahill was on his feet raising his fist in a salute for the point of the tournament. The defending champion was a long way from home, but he had shown the first signs of fight in almost an hour.Sinner, who skipped practice before Monday’s 2 pm clash had consulted the tournament doctor before stepping on court, staged a stirring physical recovery to advance to the quarterfinals, seeing off Rune 6-3, 3-6, 6-3, 6-2.It’s hard to pinpoint that moment as the turnaround, but fair to say it was where it started.At the previous change of ends, following a draining 10-minute game in which he saved three break points, the Italian sat on his courtside seat holding an ice towel to his face. His right hand shook uncontrollably.Sinner, struggling in Melbourne’s 32 degree heat, called a medical timeout –the tournament doctor took his pulse – and he left the court for a total of 11-plus minutes. A couple of games later when the Italian was serving for a 2-1 lead (sets) Rune put up his hand for a medical timeout, getting the physio to look at him.“I had a little check-up before going on the court,” Sinner said, adding, “it was a bit helpful. I felt slightly better when I went back on court. I felt like the face looked a little bit better, the color was a little bit back. So that helped, for sure. It's tough conditions.The 23-year-old looked like he was carrying an injury, leaning to his left as he dragged himself around the court.“When I'm not feeling well on the court, I tend to walk a little bit on the left,” he explained. “But, no, injury-wise, I have nothing. Just health-wise, I'm struggling a little bit.”The fourth set was as much about the top-seed’s recovery -- which was aided by a break when a thunderous first serve in Sinner’s first service game of the fourth set broke a metal ring that anchored the bottom of the net to the court. The match was delayed by 21-minutes as technicians worked to fasten the net, both players headed off court for respite from the heat.When they returned, the world no.1 was quick on the accelerator.","Defending champion Jannik Sinner beats Holger Rune in four sets.

MELBOURNE: Australian sports commentator Tony Jones apologised to Novak Djokovic on Monday for the disparaging comments made at the Australian Open .Last week’s unsavoury incident led Melbourne Park ’s ten-time champion Djokovic to decline a customary on-court interview on Sunday, following his fourth-round win over Jiri Lehecka.Djokovic had vowed not to budge from his stand until he received a public apology.The 63-year-old Jones apologised on social media with a video explaining that he had reached out to Djokovic and his camp on Saturday to apologise for the comments, which he considered as “banter”.“I considered it to be humour, which is consistent with most things I do,” Jones said. “Having said that, I was made aware on the Saturday morning from Tennis Australia via the Djokovic camp that the Djokovic camp was not happy at all with those comments.’‘I immediately contacted the Djokovic camp and issued an apology to them. And as I stand here now, I stand by that apology to Novak. I apologise if he felt that I disrespected him.”Jones had mocked Serbian fans in a live broadcast singing, “Novak, he’s overrated. Novak’s a has-been. Novak, kick him out.”He acknowledged the impact his comments had on Serbian fans and said he “overstepped the mark” with that last remark.“Now I can stand here and put whatever spin I want on that, but it can only be interpreted as a throwback to the Covid years,” he said. “That that has angered Novak, which I completely understand.”","Australian sports commentator Tony Jones apologises to Novak Djokovic for disparaging comments made at the Australian Open.

"Won't appeal in Iga Swiatek doping case, says WADA",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/australian-open/wont-appeal-in-iga-swiatek-doping-case-says-wada/articleshow/117396690.cms,"Iga Swiatek. (AP Photo)

Iga Swiatek ’s one-month suspension for failing a drug test will not be appealed by the World Anti-Doping Agency ( WADA ), which deemed her explanation “plausible,” according to a statement released on Monday.The announcement came shortly after Swiatek’s commanding 6-0, 6-1 victory over Eva Lys, which secured her a spot in the Australian Open quarterfinals.Swiatek, a five-time Grand Slam champion and former world number one, tested positive for trimetazidine (TMZ), a banned heart medication, during an out-of-competition test in August.However, the International Tennis Integrity Agency (ITIA) accepted her explanation that the positive result was caused by contamination from melatonin, a non-prescription medication she was taking to combat jet lag and sleep issues.The ITIA determined her fault was “at the lowest end of the range for no significant fault or negligence,” and WADA, after consulting external legal counsel, agreed there were no scientific or legal grounds to challenge the decision.“WADA sought advice from external legal counsel, who considered that the athlete’s contamination explanation was well evidenced, that the ITIA decision was compliant with the World Anti-Doping Code, and that there was no reasonable basis to appeal it to the CAS,” WADA said in its statement.Swiatek had already served her suspension, missing three tournaments in October, and completed the ban during tennis’s offseason. The ITIA publicly disclosed the resolution of her case in November.Reflecting on the suspension during a press conference at the Australian Open, Swiatek described the period as one of the most challenging in her life. ""For sure, it wasn’t easy; it was probably, like, the worst time in my life,"" she admitted.Initially, Swiatek and her team chose not to disclose the suspension publicly, citing ""personal reasons"" for her absence.“It got pretty awkward. We thought the suspension would be lifted quickly, and from the beginning, it was obvious that something was contaminated because the level of this substance in my urine was so low that it had to be contamination,” she explained.In contrast to Swiatek’s case, WADA has appealed the exoneration of current men’s world number one Jannik Sinner . Sinner was cleared by the ITIA after two positive tests for an anabolic steroid in March were deemed to involve no negligence. WADA’s appeal will be heard by the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) in April.Swiatek's quick return to form at the Australian Open suggests she has moved past the controversy and is focused on competing at the highest level once again.","Iga Swiatek's one-month suspension for failing a drug test will not be appealed.

NEW DELHI: Iga Swiatek showed no mercy as she brought an end to Eva Lys 's remarkable journey at the Australian Open in Melbourne on Monday, storming into the quarter-finals with a commanding 6-0, 6-1 victory.The world number two, and five-time Grand Slam champion, demonstrated her dominance against the German ""lucky loser"" to set up a clash with either Emma Navarro or Daria Kasatkina for a spot in the semi-finals.""There’s a lot to improve. I don’t feel like I’m at my peak yet,"" said Swiatek, reflecting on her performance. ""But matches like this give me confidence, and I feel like I’m playing a good game.""Swiatek, who has struggled to find consistency at the Australian Open in the past — only making the semi-finals once, in 2022—believes she has found her rhythm this year.""I usually didn’t feel comfortable at the Australian Open with my game,"" she admitted. ""But this year it’s a bit better. I’m just enjoying being on and off the court. I’m having an amazing time here, and hopefully, it lasts even longer.""Despite Lys’s spirited effort, the result was inevitable. The former world number one fended off two break points in the opening game before asserting her authority, dropping just 10 points in a first set that lasted a mere 24 minutes.When Swiatek raced to a 3-0 lead in the second set, the prospect of a humiliating ""double bagel"" (6-0, 6-0) seemed imminent. However, Lys managed to hold her serve and celebrated the moment triumphantly, earning a rousing ovation from the crowd at Rod Laver Arena .Swiatek wrapped up the match in just an hour, showcasing the gulf in class between the two players. The 23-year-old has been in formidable form, losing only 11 games in her four matches at Melbourne Park.For world number 128 Lys, her journey may have ended, but it was nothing short of extraordinary. After losing in the qualifying rounds, she earned a spot in the main draw as a lucky loser following Anna Kalinskaya's late withdrawal. Lys made history as the first lucky loser since 1988 to reach the fourth round of the Australian Open, marking an unforgettable chapter in her career.""It’s been an insane story,"" said Lys, whose run captivated fans despite its abrupt conclusion. Had she won, she would have become the first lucky loser in history to reach a Grand Slam quarter-final.Swiatek, however, remains firmly focused on her campaign, warning her competitors that she is intent on making this year’s Australian Open her most successful yet.","Iga Swiatek beats Eva Lys 6-0, 6-1 to reach quarter-finals of Australian Open.

Jannik Sinner's Serve Breaks the Net & Suspends Play! | Australian Open 2025

NEW DELHI: During reigning champion Jannik Sinner 's fourth-round match against Holger Rune on Monday, the screw that holds the net in place at the main stadium of the Australian Open came loose, causing play to be delayed for almost 20 minutes early in the fourth set.The No. 1-ranked Sinner, who is the defending champion at Melbourne Park, shook the net with one of his thunderous serves. The metal component that rotates to screw into the blue-painted surface after hooking into the bottom of the black webbing separating players on a tennis court was unintentionally undone by that.Play was stopped because the net was left open. A minimum of six individuals approached to inspect the situation and try to reconnect the apparatus. Thousands of people at Rod Laver Arena cheered when a worker with a red toolbox finally managed to fix it.To avoid having to sit on the sidelines in the afternoon heat, which reached 90 degrees Fahrenheit (32 degrees Celsius), chair umpire Nico Helwerth sent Sinner and Rune to the locker room.""Ladies and gentlemen, as you can see, we are trying to fix the net as quick as possible,"" Helwerth announced to the crowd. ""It's probably going to take a few minutes. Thank you for your patience.""During the game, every player had previously had a medical timeout. When play was stopped, Sinner had a 6-3, 3-6, 6-3, 0-1 advantage.Fans cheered as Sinner and the 13th-seeded Rune, a 21-year-old Dane, walked back out on the court to resume the match.After allowing the players to warm up for three minutes, Sinner served to restart the match.",The screw that holds the net in place at the main stadium of the Australian Open came loose.

Poll Do you agree with Shaun Pollock's comparison of Shubman Gill to Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli? Yes, he is among the best now No, it's too early to compare I need to see more performances I disagree with this comparison

NEW DELHI: In Cuttack on Tuesday, Sanju Samson ’s name did not appear on the playing XI list for India against South Africa in the first T20I. For the fourth time in India’s last six T20Is, the wicketkeeper-batter watched from the sidelines as Jitesh Sharma took his place. The selection call reopened a debate that began when the BCCI unveiled their ‘ Shubman Gill plan’ during the Asia Cup — a move that shifted Samson from his successful opening role into the middle order for just five innings before he was dropped for a specialist finisher.This time, the discussion came with a stinging dose of praise — not for Samson, but for the man whose rise has pushed him out. Former South Africa great Shaun Pollock felt the decision reflected India’s elevation of Gill into a rare bracket.“Yes, Sanju got a raw deal… I suppose you kind of need to look at Shubman Gill from a different perspective now. I think he is almost being elevated to the likes of Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli ,” Pollock told Cricbuzz. He pointed to how stalwarts work their way back into a side when available. “When they came back into teams, where did they go? They went back into their position. It wasn’t a case of shifting them down.”Pollock added that Gill’s recent Test exploits in England only strengthened his status, making it nearly impossible to move him from the top. “I think what he’s shown, even in that Test series in England, is that he’s the number one, isn’t he, batting-wise?… It’s just team dynamics. When Shubman comes back… I think he’s the best player, so he goes to the top.”He also highlighted Gill’s chemistry with Abhishek Sharma. “They know each other’s game really well and bounce off each other nicely.”Joining the panel, former Kolkata Knight Riders team director Joy Bhattacharjya delivered a blunt conclusion about Samson’s selection. “If you’re not going to bat Sanju up the order, then keeping him really doesn’t make sense… If you’ve fixed that spot and Shubman has taken it, then your keeper has to be a finisher, which is Jitesh.” He suggested India instead pick another finisher-keeper like Rishabh Pant . “There’s no point… rather than have Sanju batting out of position.”Samson’s overall record only deepens the dilemma. He has scored three hundreds as a T20I opener with a brilliant strike rate. Yet with Gill now rising into what Pollock calls the Kohli-Rohit league, Samson’s future in T20Is looks uncertain.",Shaun Pollock believes Shubman Gill is being elevated to the likes of Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli.

Unsustainable prices

All eggs in one basket

What next?

The development around JioStar’s ultimatum to the International Cricket Council (ICC) that it cannot service the remaining two years of the media rights contract due to “deep financial losses” conveys many things, but certainly not them exiting the deal.Like conjoined twins, the federation and the broadcaster have no choice but to follow the unique and challenging reality of their existence — they can neither afford to live with each other nor live without each other.On one hand, cricket has only one major broadcaster in Jio Star, and on the other, cricket is JioStar’s only recourse if they need to keep their subscription game going. So, nobody’s going anywhere.In 2023, when Disney India bought the ICC media rights at $3.04 billion, there were a total of 179 matches for the taking over the four-year cycle. Technically speaking, Disney India bid Rs 138.7 crore per game.The cost of a single IPL game at today’s global broadcast rights value is Rs 114 crore, which JioStar has been finding it difficult to sustain.Here, we’re talking about a tournament played at India prime time, involving top Indian and global cricketers, and is perched right up there among the global sports properties.Then, how exactly at Rs 138 crore per game will the broadcaster ever be able to sustain the value of ICC cricket rights? For the record, of the 179 matches, India will play only 28 games plus knockouts, if they qualify.In 2024, when Jio was taking over Disney India, did they not know the repercussions of the deal? They did, and that is the only reason why Disney exited the India market at a discounted value.Today, having acquired those rights at a discount, Jio expects the ICC to further renegotiate, only because they know there’s no other broadcaster in the fray.Today, if JioStar decides to stay away from cricket rights, cricket federations – read ICC, IPL, BCCI – simply do not have a Plan B. In fact, their Plan B will be to renegotiate and come back to Plan A, which is to stick with JioStar at a discounted price.It is precisely this lack of choice that leaves the members of the ICC with no other option but to be at the mercy of the current broadcaster. The ICC has two major events coming up in 2026 and 2027 — the men’s T20 World Cup, followed by the men’s 50-over World Cup.It is to be waited and seen if the ICC members will sit across the table with JioStar ahead of these events to guarantee them a better pricing in the next rights cycle to allow the cricketing caravan to keep moving.That is clearly the only end game to this whole exercise.The ruckus is not lost on the IPL franchises. In fact, ever since the mega merger between Jio and Disney happened, they had seen this coming.When a brand valuation and consultancy firm like Brand Finance comes out with a report that says IPL’s 2025 brand value is down by 20% — from $12b to $9.6b — one can pin it down to the broadcast rights, IPL’s biggest revenue source.In 2022, multiple bidders had fought tooth and nail to grab IPL rights, and it brought in a cash influx of Rs 48,300 cr.In 2026-27, only two broad casters will be in the fray (and one of them only for TV). What kind of a hike can the industry expect? The IPL rights stood at a billion in 2008, got sold for $2.6b in 2017 and got resold for $6.5b in 2022.While franchises are wondering what next, the industry is speculating a five to 10% hike, no more.That’s the long and short of the media rights story.","JioStar says it cannot service the remaining two years of the media rights contract due to ‘deep financial losses’ The cost of a single IPL game at today’s global broadcast rights value is Rs 114 crore, which JioStar has been finding it difficult to sustain.

Poll What do you think contributed most to India's victory in the first T20I? Pandya's batting Bowling attack South Africa's poor performance

NEW DELHI: Hardik Pandya delivered a statement innings under pressure and a message of intent for the season ahead, smashing an unbeaten 59 off just 28 balls to fire India to a commanding 101-run win over South Africa in the first T20I at Cuttack on Tuesday. Named Player of the Match, Pandya walked in when India were wobbling, assessed a spicy surface shrewdly, and counterattacked with brute precision to lift India to 175/6 — a total that proved far beyond the visitors, who folded for 74 in 12.3 overs.The all-rounder described the knock as a blend of instinct and composure. “I had to back my shots… the wicket had a bit of spice. You had to be a little gutsy. It was more about timing the ball, not trying to break the ball,” Pandya said, delighted with how he paced the innings.His blitz also came as a reward for relentless work on his conditioning. Away from home, away from distractions, the 32-year-old spent nearly two months grinding at the National Cricket Academy to regain peak fitness. “These last 50 days, being away from your loved ones, spending time at the NCA, making sure everything is covered… it's very satisfying when you come here and the results follow,” he reflected.But if there was one line that defined his night, it was his declaration of purpose. “It doesn't matter what Hardik Pandya wants; it matters what India wants. I've always tried to put my team first. That's my biggest USP,” he said, stressing that roles don't dictate his motivation — only contributions do.Pandya's calculated assault also included taking on Keshav Maharaj at a key stage. “He took a chance and I took a chance. Mine was more calculated on that track… it gave us rhythm and momentum,” he explained.India's total was more than enough, as Jasprit Bumrah, Arshdeep Singh, Varun Chakravarthy and Axar Patel all picked two wickets each, dismantling South Africa's chase with ruthless precision.","India beat South Africa by 101 runs in the first T20I at Cuttack.

NEW DELHI: Arshdeep Singh opened up about his mindset and approach with the new ball during India’s win over South Africa in the first T20I at the Barabati Stadium, explaining that his focus was on hitting the seam and trying to ""get as much purchase off the wicket. ""After being asked to bat first, India put up 175/6, led by Hardik Pandya ’s unbeaten 59, before the bowlers took control. Arshdeep delivered early breakthroughs in the powerplay, removing Quinton de Kock for a duck in the opening over and dismissing Tristan Stubbs in the third.The left-arm pacer struck once in each of the two overs he bowled, ending with figures of 2-14. Speaking about his thought process while defending the total, Arshdeep said, “The thought process is simple: just go there and try to use as much help as there is in the wicket and try to get the team early wickets. I feel like if you were hitting the seam hard, there was something in the wicket, either it was bouncing more or seaming in or out.""The idea was to just hit the seam as hard as possible and get as much purchase off the wicket. I bowled full, got a wicket. Then bowled full, went for a four. Then I knew I had to bowl short, got a wicket on that. Again bowled full, went for a four. So yeah, I was getting quick reminders there.”During the match, Jasprit Bumrah dismissed Dewald Brevis to complete 100 T20I wickets, becoming only the second Indian bowler after Arshdeep to reach the milestone.Asked what he told the Mumbai Indians pacer upon the achievement, the 26-year-old said, “Yeah, I just told him ‘Welcome.’ Congratulated him and told him, ‘Welcome to the club.’”Arshdeep also spoke about how economical spells from the bowlers help ease the captain’s decision-making. “It makes life very easy for the captain as well. They can play around with the bowling combinations, whenever he wants Jassi (Bumrah) bhai to bowl three in the powerplay or me to bowl three in the powerplay. We just try to give him as much flexibility as possible and we’re enjoying each other’s company. I mean, I’m just trying to enjoy the present and just have fun. It’s very rare you get to play on these kinds of wickets where there’s seam and swing on offer. So I just try to stay patient, not get too excited seeing help in the wicket, stay disciplined and enjoy whatever is there.”","Arshdeep Singh says his focus was on hitting the seam and trying to ""get as much purchase off the wicket"" The left-arm pacer struck once in each of the two overs he bowled, ending with figures of 2-14.

Kapil Dev ManKaded Peter Kirsten | Warned in 1st game & Ran out ManKaded in 2nd Game 1992

NEW DELHI: On this day, 33 years ago, fans witnessed one of the most fiery moments in ODI cricket when Kapil Dev ran out Peter Kirsten at the non-striker’s end during India’s 1992-93 tour of South Africa. The incident, later labelled a textbook ‘Mankad’, came during the second ODI in Gqeberha on December 9, 1992 — and remains one of the most debated dismissals of Kapil’s career.In the ninth over of South Africa’s chase, Kapil spotted Kirsten repeatedly backing up too far before the ball left his hand. Having warned him in the previous game, the Indian great decided he had seen enough. The Haryana Hurricane slowed his stride, stopped for a moment, and whipped off the bails at the non-striker’s end. The umpire raised his finger immediately, leaving Kirsten stunned and walking back, disgruntled and visibly annoyed.What followed was drama that cricket cameras captured in full. South African captain Kepler Wessels and Kirsten exchanged a few heated words with Kapil, which only provoked the Indian pacer further.An angry Kapil gestured with raised fingers, signalling how many times he had warned Kirsten.While critics then debated spirit versus law, Kapil needed no warning to justify the act. Under the MCC law (now 38.3.1), a bowler can run out a non-striker at any moment before releasing the ball if the batter is outside the crease. The dismissal, earlier classified under “Unfair Play”, was later separated from that stigma following repeated controversies — most notably when R Ashwin ran out Jos Buttler in IPL 2019. Ashwin later revealed that Kapil Dev had personally backed him during the criticism storm.Peter Kirsten himself admitted years later that Kapil had indeed warned him. “I would be lying if I say Kapil didn’t warn me. He did,” Kirsten said. He insists there are no hard feelings today. “We made up over a drink,” he joked.","Kapil Dev ran out Peter Kirsten at the non-striker's end during India's 1992-93 tour of South Africa.

Poll Do you agree with Nathan Lyon's emotional admission after being dropped from the team? Strongly Agree Agree Disagree

NEW DELHI: Australia’s premier off-spinner Nathan Lyon stunned the cricketing world when he openly admitted he was feeling “absolutely filthy” after being dropped for the second Ashes Test at the Gabba. The rare emotional outburst went viral, prompting admiration from fans for his honesty — and sparking a debate on why Indian cricketers don’t react similarly when axed from the playing XI.That question recently landed straight in front of India’s own veteran spinner, Ravichandran Ashwin , during a discussion on his YouTube show Ash Ki Baat. This time, instead of dodging, Ashwin offered a revealing insight into the unspoken rules that govern Indian cricket culture.“Nathan Lyon is lucky,” Ashwin began, placing the issue beyond just performance. “If anyone is dropped from the team, the emotions would be similar to what Lyon expressed in front of the world. He got the media to express his views, and he did just that. The Australian team wouldn’t feel bad, and he would play the Adelaide Test. I am just happy for Nathan Lyon.”But the honesty that earned Lyon respect, Ashwin believes, could cost an Indian cricketer dearly.“People have emotions, and they will do just that. However, I cannot express my emotions, because if I do, I will lose out, and only my harm will be caused. So why will I do that? However, I really respect Nathan Lyon; he let his emotions out. Good on him,” Ashwin added.According to Ashwin, the issue isn’t about restrictions — it’s about consequences. Indian players are allowed to speak, but must constantly weigh what he calls the “collateral damage.”“We, as Indian cricketers, are allowed to express our opinion. No one is stopping us. But what is collateral damage? Your expression and emotion are not given as much respect because you will be stamped as a person of a certain character for doing that. I hope this will change with the passage of time, and it should.”Ashwin then offered a striking cultural comparison, illustrating how self-expression is celebrated abroad but judged at home.“Just take the example of Chris Gayle… He himself said, ‘I am the Universe Boss’, and we accepted that. Now imagine, tomorrow, Abhishek Sharma comes to the press conference wearing a big chain and exclaims to the world, ‘I am the Universe Boss’. Will we accept him? No. Because in our mind, there is a conditioning that we need to credit someone else, no matter how hard we have worked. I hope that really changes.”",Ravichandran Ashwin says Indian cricketers are not allowed to express their emotions.

NEW DELHI: India women’s cricket star Smriti Mandhana on Sunday officially confirmed that her wedding to music composer Palash Muchhal has been called off — but amid the emotional turbulence, one person stood by her more closely than anyone else: teammate and close friend Jemimah Rodrigues After weeks of speculation, online theories and fragmented reports, Mandhana finally addressed the situation publicly through an Instagram post.The couple was set to tie the knot on November 23, but the ceremony was first postponed after Mandhana’s father, Srinivas, suffered a sudden medical emergency. Reports later emerged suggesting Palash Muchhal, too, had been hospitalised due to stress, further fuelling speculation.With rumours spiralling, Mandhana broke her silence.“Over the past few weeks there has been plenty of speculation around my life and I feel it is important for me to speak out at this time,"" she wrote.

When the wedding was initially postponed, Jemimah left her Women’s Big Bash League campaign in Australia midway to fly back home and be by Mandhana’s side. And now, with the breakup confirmed, she once again signalled support — not with words, but with music.On Sunday, Jemimah posted a cryptic yet emotionally loaded Instagram story featuring a group of singers performing Olivia Dean’s Man I Need.The lyrics — “Looks like we’re making up for lost time. Need you to spell it out for me” — immediately caught attention.Despite the heartbreak, Mandhana made her priorities clear: cricket remains her grounding force. “I believe there is a higher purpose driving us all and for me that has always been representing my country at the highest level.

Will franchises warm up to Prithvi Shaw?

MUMBAI: Mumbai batters Sarfaraz Khan and Prithvi Shaw , who went unsold at last year’s IPL auction in Jeddah, have been named in the opening set of players for the IPL 2026 auction, to be held in Abu Dhabi on Dec 16. Both have fixed their base price at Rs 75 lakh. Shaw is currently representing Maharashtra.They feature in the capped batters’ set alongside Devon Conway, Jake Fraser-McGurk, Cameron Green and David Miller, all with a base price of Rs 2 crore. Interestingly, Green — tipped to be among the costliest buys — has been listed only as a batter. “Perhaps he wants to be seen more as a batter. It doesn’t mean he won’t bowl. He’s doing so in the Ashes,” a franchise official told TOI.The final auction list features 350 players — 240 Indians and 110 overseas — with 77 slots available, including 31 for overseas cricketers. Thirty-five new players — including Quinton de Kock, Dunith Wellalage and George Linde — were added after franchise requests, while 227 uncapped domestic players have fixed their base at Rs 30 lakh.The second set includes Venkatesh Iyer (Rs 2 crore), released by KKR after a Rs 23.75-cr buy, along with Deepak Hooda (Rs 75 lakh) and overseas allrounders Gus Atkinson, Wanindu Hasaranga, Liam Living stone, Wiaan Mulder and Rachin Ravindra. Kolkata Knight Riders have the biggest purse (Rs 64.3 crore) with 13 slots to fill, including six overseas. Chennai Super Kings are next with Rs 43.4 crore after trading Ravindra Jadeja to Rajasthan Royals for Sanju Samson.“This auction will mainly be about KKR and CSK. The rest have their core in place and will largely window-shop,” a franchise official said.Dropped by Mumbai last season and ignored at the previous auction, Shaw, 26, moved to Maharashtra and has revived his form, topping their Ranji Trophy charts with 470 runs in five matches at 67.14, including a highest score of 222. In the SMAT, he scored 183 runs in seven games at 26.14, with two fifties. “If his fitness, attitude and form hold, he could fetch a decent price,” the official added.Despite a stellar first-class record of 4,863 runs at 63.15 with 16 hundreds, Sarfaraz has gone unsold in the last two auctions. His T20 record remains modest with 1,375 runs at 25 and a strike rate of 132.59. He, however, struck form in the SMAT with 187 runs in four matches at 93.50, including a unbeaten 100 off 47 balls against Assam.Among uncapped domestic players, Tanush Kotian, Shams Mulani and J&K allrounder Auqib Nabi are priced at Rs 30 lakh. Forty players have opted for the Rs 2-cr bracket, with Venkatesh Iyer and Ravi Bishnoi the only Indians. Nikhil Chaudhary, who shifted from Punjab to Australia, is listed as an Indian uncapped allrounder and has featured in the Big Bash League.","Prithvi Shaw and Sarfaraz Khan have been named in the opening set of players for the IPL 2026 auction, to be held in Abu Dhabi on Dec 16.

NEW DELHI: Pat Cummins has returned to Australia's squad as the Ashes moves to Adelaide, with the hosts holding a commanding 2-0 lead in the series. The Australia captain has taken a significant step towards making his international comeback after being named in a 15-player squad for the third Ashes Test against England.Cummins has not played international cricket since the third Test against the West Indies in July, but the 32-year-old appears to have overcome the lingering issues related to his troublesome back.

Experienced batter Usman Khawaja has been retained as he works to reclaim his place in the playing XI following his own injury setback.All-rounder Beau Webster and veteran spinner Nathan Lyon have also been named in the 15-member squad after missing out on selection for the second Test in Brisbane, which Australia won by eight wickets. Both are in contention for a recall alongside Cummins for the Adelaide Test.Australia coach Andrew McDonald suggested that Cummins was close to featuring in the Brisbane Test and is now almost a certainty for Adelaide.""We feel as though he (Cummins) will be as best prepared as can be,"" McDonald said.""He was well ahead of where we thought he'd be at and it did create a real live conversation for (Cummins playing in) Brisbane.""It was debated a lot leading into that Test match. With that in mind, us seeing him further advanced, we feel he'll be really well placed for the challenges of Adelaide albeit (it's still) a long way off.""We feel as though the simulation in the nets has got him skill ready.

Suryakumar Yadav Press Conference: on Sanju, Dube & India’s T20 Gameplan for South Africa

CUTTACK: Coming back into the Indian side after a 74-day injury lay off, Hardik Pandya looked like he never missed a game in between. Visibly in great touch, India’s premier allrounder scored a 28-ball unbeaten 59 on return to help India to 175/6 in their 20 overs, before the bowlers fired in unison to skittle South Africa out for their lowest total in T20Is for a 101-run win in the opening game of the five-match series on Tuesday.What looked like a competitive total at first proved to be a tall ask for the clueless South African batting as they collapsed to an efficient Indian bowling attack, going down for 74 in 12.3 overs. South Africa’s previous lowest total was against India, too — 87 in Rajkot in June 2022.All the six bowlers used by captain Suryakumar Yadav were among wickets and they never let South Africa take charge of their chase. From the moment they lost Quinton de Kock off the second ball of the innings for a duck to left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh, the visitors were never in the hunt.Only four of the South African batters scored in two digits, with Dewald Brevis top-scoring with 22. Arshdeep, Jasprit Bumrah, spinners Varun Chakravarthy and Axar Patel took two wickets each, while pace bowling allrounders Pandya and Shivam Dube scalped one each.Earlier, almost all his teammates found it difficult to get going against a four-pronged SA pace attack on a newly laid, red-soil pitch, but Pandya was in a different zone, carrying his form from hitting a 42-ball 77 in the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy for Baroda against Punjab last Tuesday.Comeback man Shubman Gill lasted only two balls while captain Yadav’s below-par form continued. Opener Abhishek Sharma (17 runs off 12 balls), Tilak Varma (26 off 32) and Patel (23 off 21) could not convert the starts. Meanwhile, Shivam Dube, playing as a pace-bowling allrounder in place of specialist spinner Kuldeep Yadav, lost his stumps to Donovan Ferreira’s off-spin.Coming in the middle with the scoreboard reading 78/4 in the 12th over, Pandya obliged with some fireworks to increase the run-rate. He hit the second and fourth balls he faced for two towering sixes off left-arm spinner Keshav Maharaj.The 15th over by tearaway pacer Anrich Nortje, who was also making a comeback after 16 months, fetched 17 runs, with Pandya hitting two fours, one charging down the ground and a short and wide ball going over wicketkeeper Quinton de Kock’s head to boundary.Pacer Lutho Sipamla and Marco Jansen were not spared either. Wicketkeeper Jitesh Sharma, preferred over Sanju Samson, added 10 runs off five balls with a six over deep backward square leg off Sipamla.",Hardik Pandya returns to the Indian side after a 74-day injury lay off.

Fans travel thousands of kilometres to watch Virat Kohli, Rohit Sharma play

NEW DELHI: Former Pakistan captain Shahid Afridi has backed Indian stars Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma , rejecting narratives suggesting they should be phased out of the ODI setup. He insisted the duo remains vital to India’s plans and should continue until the 2027 ODI World Cup, according to a report published on Monday.“It’s a fact that Virat and Rohit are the backbone of the Indian batting line-up, and the way they have played in the recent ODI series, it can confidently be said that they can play until the 2027 World Cup,” Afridi said.Afridi added that both should feature primarily in high-profile matches. “You need to preserve both these stars, and when India is playing against a weaker team, they can try some new players and rest Virat and Rohit,” he said.The former all-rounder also criticised India’s head coach Gautam Gambhir , with whom he shared frosty on-field moments during their playing careers.“The way Gautam started his stint, it looked like he thought that what he thinks and says is right, but after some time, it was proved that you are not always right.”Afridi also expressed joy over Rohit surpassing his ODI six-hitting record.“Records are meant to be broken, and this too is now bettered.I am happy that a player whom I have always liked has broken this record.”“My record of fastest century stood for nearly 18 years, but it was finally broken, so records are set by one player and another player comes and breaks it. This is cricket.”Rohit went past Afridi’s tally of 351 ODI sixes during India’s second ODI against South Africa in Raipur and now stands at 355 from 279 games.Reflecting on his association with Rohit during the 2008 IPL season, Afridi recalled: “I played alongside Rohit for the Deccan Chargers in my only Indian Premier League (IPL) season in 2008, and at that time, I liked him.“During practice sessions of the Charges, I watched him bat, and his class impressed me. I knew that one day Rohit would play for India, and he has proved himself as a classy batter,” he said.",Former Pakistan captain Shahid Afridi has backed Indian stars Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma.

Suryakumar Yadav Press Conference: on Sanju, Dube & India’s T20 Gameplan for South Africa

Brief Scores:

India opened their T20 World Cup 2026 preparations with a resounding 101-run victory in the first T20I against South Africa at the Barabati Stadium, powered by Hardik Pandya ’s strong all-round display and a disciplined bowling performance. The win puts India 1-0 ahead in the five-match series.Chasing 176, South Africa’s innings fell apart almost immediately. Arshdeep Singh struck with his second delivery, removing Quinton de Kock for a duck. He followed it up by dismissing Tristan Stubbs in the third over, halting the batter’s early aggression. Aiden Markram and Dewald Brevis attempted to rebuild, but Axar Patel ’s introduction inside the powerplay brought an instant breakthrough as the South African skipper was bowled for 14.Hardik Pandya, returning to the national side after injury, made an impact with the ball as well. His very first delivery removed David Miller, deepening South Africa’s growing problems. The collapse gathered pace, with only Marco Jansen offering a brief counterattack through a pair of sixes before Varun Chakaravarthy ended his stay.Jasprit Bumrah then reached a personal milestone, claiming his 100th T20I wicket by dismissing Brevis, and added Keshav Maharaj moments later.Axar Patel accounted for Anrich Nortje soon after, and Shivam Dube completed the rout by removing Lutho Sipamla, as South Africa folded for just 74 in 12.3 overs, their lowest total in T20I history.Earlier in the evening, India endured a shaky start. Lungi Ngidi removed Shubman Gill in the first over and returned to dismiss Suryakumar Yadav , who briefly counterpunched with a six and a four, including his trademark supla shot. Abhishek Sharma and Tilak Varma steadied the innings to guide India to 40/2 after six overs, but Abhishek’s dismissal to Sipamla stalled the momentum again.Tilak and Axar Patel tried to build through the middle overs but struggled for rhythm. Tilak’s scratchy 26 off 32 eventually came to an end, leaving India searching for acceleration. That responsibility fell to Hardik Pandya, who played an innings of rare fluency on a pitch that gripped and slowed throughout the night. His unbeaten 59 off 28 balls, decorated with six fours and four sixes, lifted India to a competitive 175/6. Late contributions from Shivam Dube and Jitesh Sharma added valuable runs.Despite South Africa’s early breakthroughs and Jansen’s tight spells, Pandya stood out with timing and power that few others managed on the surface. His knock transformed India’s innings and ultimately shaped the course of the match.With India carrying a 1-0 advantage, the teams now travel to New Chandigarh for the second T20I on Thursday at the Maharaja Yadavindra Singh International Cricket Stadium.India 175/6 in 20 overs (Hardik Pandya 59*, Tilak Varma 26; Lungi Ngidi 3/31, Lutho Sipamla 2/38)South Africa 74 all out in 12.3 overs (Dewald Brevis 22, Tristan Stubbs 14; Axar Patel 2/7, Arshdeep Singh 2/14)India won by 101 runs.","India beat South Africa by 101 runs in the first T20I in Cuttack.

With questions around his future at Liverpool, Mohamed Salah sent a message on Tuesday without using words. After the reaction to his comments on Saturday, Salah shared a photo on Instagram and X, showing him alone in the gym at Liverpool’s training base.In the image, Salah is seated on a workout bench facing a mirror, holding his phone for a selfie, with no expression on his face. The Egypt forward was not included in Liverpool’s squad for the Champions League match against Inter Milan. Despite that, the post showed he had reported for training and was working out at the club’s facilities.The post followed stronger comments he made after being left out of the team for the third match in a row, as Liverpool drew 3-3 with Leeds on Saturday.""It seems like the club has thrown me under the bus. That is how I am feeling. I think it is very clear that someone wanted me to get all of the blame,"" he said during an unscheduled interaction with reporters outside the stadium.Salah was aware of the impact of those remarks, made at a time when Liverpool’s title defence has struggled and pressure has increased on head coach Arne Slot.He did not travel with the squad to Milan on Monday. Slot said he was unsure whether Salah would play for the club again.""I cannot answer that question at this point in time,"" Slot said. ""I am a firm believer that there is always a possibility to return for a player. I can leave it with that I think.""Former Liverpool player and Sky Sports analyst Jamie Carragher was more critical.""I thought it was a disgrace what he did after the game,"" Carragher said on Monday Night Football. ""Some people have painted it as an emotional outburst, I don’t think it was.""Carragher added that Salah had decided ""to go for the manager and maybe try and get him sacked.""Salah is among Liverpool’s most successful players. He has won two Premier League titles, the Champions League and several other trophies with the club.Last season, he was named player of the year for the third time after scoring 34 goals in all competitions and helping Liverpool win a record-equaling 20th league title.He ended speculation about his future in April by signing a two-year contract extension, which reports said made him the club’s highest-paid player. However, his form has declined during a difficult start to the season, with Liverpool winning only two of their last 10 league matches.Salah has scored four league goals in 13 appearances this season. He was first left out against West Ham last month, then named on the bench against Sunderland, and later remained an unused substitute against Leeds.Those decisions led to his remarks, including saying he felt like ""someone doesn’t want me in the club.""He also said he has ""any relationship"" with Slot.""It is not the first or last time a player who doesn’t play says something similar to what he did,"" Slot said Monday. ""But my reaction to that is clear and that’s why he is not here tonight.""Salah is set to leave for the Africa Cup of Nations next week. He said he was unsure what would happen during his absence.",Mohamed Salah shared a photo on Instagram showing him alone in the gym.

As the captain of the MLS Cup champions, Inter Miami, Messi has established himself as the dominant force in Major League Soccer.At 38, the Argentine star continues to break records, adding another milestone to his illustrious career.

While Preki won in 1997 and 2003, all other recipients have earned the award only once.""He was fantastic the whole season, with the numbers and also with the commitment,"" Inter Miami coach and longtime Messi teammate Javier Mascherano said.Despite playing in only half of Inter Miami's regular-season games in 2024, Messi's impact was undeniable. While last year's vote was close, this year's decision was clear-cut.The voting results showed Messi receiving 70.4% of total votes. San Diego's Anders Dreyer finished second with 11.2%, followed by LAFC's Denis Bouanga at 7.3%, Cincinnati's Evander at 4.8%, and Nashville's Sam Surridge at 2.4%.Messi's career accolades include eight Ballon d'Or titles, eight Pichichi trophies, six La Liga best player awards, three Best FIFA Men's Player awards, three UEFA Men's Player of the Year wins, two FIFA World Cup Golden Balls, and 15 selections as Argentina's best player.He has won 47 trophies with club and country, including the 2022 World Cup.""The reality,"" Mascherano said as the regular season was ending, ""is that Leo clears all doubts.""Messi becomes the sixth player to win both MVP and a championship in the same MLS season. Only Josef Martinez of Atlanta United in 2018 had previously achieved the triple feat of MVP, title, and Golden Boot in one year, which Messi matched in 2025.In MLS history, only four players have been MVP finalists the year after winning the award: Carlos Valderrama (1996-1997), Marco Etcheverry (1998-1999), David Villa (2016-2017), and Josef Martinez (2018-2019).Messi has committed his future to Inter Miami with a three-year contract extension. He will be present when the team opens its new stadium near Miami International Airport next season.Back-to-back MVPs are common in other major US sports leagues. Recent examples include Shohei Ohtani and Aaron Judge in baseball, A'ja Wilson in the WNBA, Nikola Jokic in the NBA, Aaron Rodgers in the NFL, and Alex Ovechkin in the NHL.","Lionel Messi has secured the MLS MVP award, making history as the first player to claim this honour in consecutive years.

NEW DELHI: In a landmark moment for Indian football, seven transgender teams made their debut in a dedicated tournament held under the banner of the Jamshedpur Super League (JSL). The Transgenders' League, which kicked off on Sunday, features seven sides — Jamshedpur FT, Chaibasa FC, Chakradharpur FC, Jamshedpur Indranagar FC, Naomundi FC, Saraikela FC and Kolhan Tiger FC — competing in a five-a-side format.Originally, only four teams were planned, but increasing interest led to three additional teams being added. The competition is part of the larger JSL framework, which also includes several age-group leagues.The opening day produced dominant performances. Jamshedpur FT registered a resounding 7-0 win against Chaibasa FC, while Kolhan Tiger FC clinched a 3-0 victory over Chakradharpur FC. Jamshedpur Indranagar FC and Noamundi FC played out a goalless draw.For Jamshedpur FT forward Puja Soy, scoring four goals in the inaugural match marked more than just sporting success — it symbolised long-awaited recognition.“Football is such a beautiful sport, and for the first time, I felt like I wasn’t being seen for my gender, but for my game,” she said.Another participant, Aliya, expressed how playing in a professional setup was a first for many.“This is the first time we are playing in a proper professional environment,” she said. “The support from the club and the fans makes us feel like we truly belong to the football family.”For most participants, just stepping onto the pitch was empowering. Jamshedpur FT captain Pyari Hessa summed up the emotional milestone.“We are thrilled to be part of this ground-breaking initiative, India’s first Transgender League,” she said.“It gives us a platform we never had before and will hopefully inspire other states to create similar spaces. We’re very grateful to Jamshedpur FC for making this possible.”According to organisers, the objective goes far beyond competition.""The introduction of the Transgender Football League marks a progressive and meaningful step in our commitment to making football inclusive, accessible, and empowering for every individual,"" said Jamshedpur FC Head of Grassroot and Youth Football, Kundan Chandra.""As a club we firmly believe that football must serve as a platform where talent is nurtured without discrimination.""The league features 70 players from diverse backgrounds — Tata Steel employees, daily-wage earners, small-business workers and more. Each team will play 12 matches, with 42 fixtures scheduled overall.Rebranded from the All India Football Federation’s Blue Cubs League framework, the JSL has evolved into a vibrant six-month football festival — one that now includes a historic step toward inclusivity in Indian sport.","The Jamshedpur Super League (JSL) features seven transgender teams.

Poll Do you support the mandatory hydration breaks during the 2026 Men's World Cup matches? Yes, it's necessary for player safety. No, it disrupts the flow of the game.

FIFA has confirmed a major change to match regulations for the 2026 Men's World Cup in North America: every game will now feature a mandatory three-minute hydration break in each half, regardless of weather conditions, venue or stadium technology.Starting next year, referees will stop the game at the 22-minute mark of each half to allow players to drink water and cool down. Unlike previous tournaments, this rule will apply even in roofed stadiums or venues with advanced air-conditioning systems across the United States, Canada and Mexico.Officials will have limited flexibility. If the game is already paused shortly before the 22-minute mark because of an injury or stoppage, the hydration break could be merged into that delay. “This will be addressed on the spot with the referee,” said Manolo Zubiria, FIFA's chief tournament officer for 2026, during a meeting with broadcasters where the change was first presented.The governing body called the update a “streamlined and simplified version” of existing regulations, which previously mandated breaks only when a specific heat threshold was crossed — once set at 32°C using the wet bulb global temperature measurement.The decision follows concerns raised during this year's FIFA Club World Cup in the United States, where players struggled in high humidity. Tournaments in previous years have also highlighted similar risks, with a Brazilian court famously ordering FIFA to enforce cooling breaks during the 2014 World Cup or face fines.Beyond safety, the change is expected to benefit broadcasters, who gain predictable stoppage windows for advertising breaks and coverage planning — a rare fixed moment in a sport known for continuous play.","FIFA has confirmed a major change to match regulations for the 2026 Men's World Cup in North America.

Vidit Gujrathi Exclusive: Indian Grandmaster Hits Out At Goa Criticism During FIDE World Cup

NEW DELHI: With the future of the Indian Super League (ISL) looking uncertain, TOI has learnt from sources that the sports ministry has ruled out using govt funds to support the All India Football Federation (AIFF), club owners and other stakeholders in running the ISL. Although the ministry has assured that the ISL and the second-tier I-League will take place this season, it could not draw on its annual budgetary allocation for that purpose. “The ministry can't help in funding and running of the league. That has to be done by the stakeholders involved,” a source informed.The ministry has suggested that ISL clubs should fund the interim expenses themselves until a new sponsorship deal is struck. This would allow the league to begin at the earliest. Once a suitable new commercial sponsor comes on board or the existing agreement with Football Sports Development Limited (FSDL) is reworked, the amount spent could be adjusted against the sponsorship revenue.It also recommended that clubs limit the number of venues and explore conducting the league in fewer cities to cut operational and logistical costs. The ISL usually kicks off in Sept every season but, as yet, the competition has not started. The Supreme Court (SC) is all set to hold a crucial hearing on Tuesday to resolve the commercial rights impasse concerning the future of the ISL. The agenda of the hearing is to discuss a pathway for the commercial aspects of the league, as the existing Master Rights Agreement between AIFF and its commercial partner FSDL expired on Monday (Dec 8).It's been learnt that the ministry submitted a status report to the apex court on Monday.","The sports ministry has ruled out using govt funds to support the All India Football Federation (AIFF), club owners and other stakeholders in running the ISL.

Poll Do you think Crystal Palace will qualify for the Champions League this season? Yes No

Crystal Palace’s stunning Premier League surge continued on Sunday as they climbed into fourth place with a 2-1 win over Fulham, while Brighton struck in stoppage-time to deny West Ham a vital escape from the relegation zone in a 1-1 draw.At Craven Cottage, Marc Guehi was the hero for Palace, powering home an 87th-minute header that sealed their fourth win in six league outings. The late strike pushed Oliver Glasner’s side above Chelsea and Everton, strengthening what has now become a genuine bid for Champions League qualification.It marks yet another milestone in a remarkable period for the formerly unfancied south London club, who have already celebrated a shock FA Cup triumph over Manchester City last season and lifted the Community Shield against Liverpool earlier this term. They are also pushing through the UEFA Conference League group phase and could soon be preparing for a dream European upgrade.Palace struck first in the 20th minute when Adam Wharton’s smart through ball found Eddie Nketiah, who drilled home past Bernd Leno. Fulham levelled in the 38th minute through Harry Wilson’s stunning outside-of-the-boot finish. Emile Smith Rowe briefly thought he had completed the comeback, but his close-range effort was ruled out after VAR spotted a marginal offside by Samuel Chukwueze.Palace punished that reprieve with Guehi’s decisive finish from a corner.“It makes me proud because the team did not want to defend the draw, we wanted to win and that’s why we got it,” Glasner said, hailing his side’s belief and resilience.Meanwhile, at the Amex Stadium, West Ham were seconds from climbing out of the relegation zone after Jarrod Bowen fired them ahead in the 73rd minute. But Georginio Rutter’s scrappy stoppage-time effort rescued a point for seventh-placed Brighton, keeping them in the European chase while leaving West Ham in 18th place.Manager Nuno Espirito Santo was furious after VAR allowed the equaliser to stand. “It’s hard to take,” Nuno said. “Everybody saw it. We cannot understand how they gave the goal.” Despite the frustration, West Ham’s improved form — one defeat in six — continues to fuel hope for survival.",Crystal Palace moved into fourth place with a 2-1 win over Fulham.

Liverpool coach Arne Slot was still processing Liverpool’s latest setback at Leeds when Mohamed Salah criticised him and the club’s management in a post-match interaction, raising questions about whether his time at Anfield (home ground of Liverpool FC) is coming to an end.Liverpool, the Premier League champions, are dealing with a poor run of four wins in 15 matches across competitions and now face the possibility of a difficult split with one of their most successful players.Only Ian Rush and Roger Hunt have scored more goals for the club than Salah, who has 250. The forward contributed to two league titles, including last season, when he won multiple individual awards as Slot secured the league in his first year.Salah has now said his relationship with Slot has broken down after being kept on the bench for three straight matches.""I'm very, very disappointed to be fair. I have done so much for this club down the years and especially last season,"" Salah told media. ""Now I'm sitting on the bench and I don't know why. It seems like the club has thrown me under the bus. That is how I am feeling. I think it is very clear that someone wanted me to get all of the blame.""Slot had backed Salah through the season despite the 33-year-old struggling for form. Salah has scored five goals in 19 games and has been criticised by pundits for not contributing defensively.Salah and Liverpool were already preparing for a temporary break, with the player set to join Egypt for the Africa Cup of Nations after fixtures against Inter Milan and Brighton this week.Salah suggested the Brighton match could be his last at Anfield.""I’m going to enjoy that game because I don’t know what is going to happen now,"" he said.""I will be at Anfield to say goodbye to the fans and go to the Africa cup.

Mike Tomlin reacts to Philip Rivers’ return



The NFL rarely delivers quiet weeks, but the shock that rippled across the league when Philip Rivers resurfaced still felt unreal. News of the 44-year-old quarterback landing a workout with the Indianapolis Colts arrived like a plot twist no one had drafted, and even Mike Tomlin needed a second to process it. The Steelers coach, already navigating a tense season, wasn’t expecting to hear Rivers’ name tossed back into the mix, especially not after a five-year absence from the field.The Colts moved fast. After injuries hit Daniel Jones, Riley Leonard and Anthony Richardson, Monday’s emergency workout turned into Tuesday’s official signing to the practice squad. Rivers, who last played in the 2020-21 campaign and guided Indianapolis to an 11-5 finish, is suddenly back in the orbit of an NFL season he left behind. That was more than enough to surprise Tomlin, who didn’t hide his disbelief when the topic surfaced during his weekly availability.Tomlin was asked if a quarterback in his mid-forties could step back into the league after half a decade away. The question alone threw him off. With widened eyes, he answered, ""I have no idea what you're talking about."" When the reporter clarified that the Colts had indeed worked out Rivers, Tomlin smiled and said, ""That's none of my business.I'm trying to get ready for the Dolphins.""The Steelers coach last saw Rivers in one of the quarterback’s final games, a matchup that ended with Pittsburgh edging out a 28-24 win. Rivers threw for 270 yards that evening, delivering the kind of performance that showed he could still sling it even near the end. Whether he’ll get another shot this season depends on how quickly the Colts’ battered depth chart heals, and whether this improbable comeback turns into anything more than insurance.Tomlin wasn’t alone in his amusement. Chargers star safety Derwin James, who shared a locker room with Rivers earlier in his career, also couldn’t believe what he was hearing. “Yeah I seen that, I was like, ‘Whoa!’ I looked at the TV and I’m like, ‘Whoa, what is Phil doing?!’ I said, ‘Oh Phil, what you got going on?’” James said. He added, “He always got it. As long as he got that mind and that arm, he’ll be alright.”If Rivers does take the field again, it would be one of the most unexpected storylines of the season. And for now, even Tomlin is content to watch it unfold from afar.Also Read: Is Taylor Swift the real reason Stephen A. thinks Travis Kelce could retire sooner than anyone expected?",Philip Rivers signed with the Indianapolis Colts on Tuesday.

Old Tom Brady line comes back to haunt Philip Rivers just as he prepares for a shocking 2025 NFL appearance



Philip Rivers is back in the NFL conversation, a twist almost no one imagined as the 2025 season reached its final stretch. The longtime Chargers star reunited with the Colts this week after signing to their practice squad, and now he stands only a step away from landing on the active roster for Week 15 against the Seahawks. The buzz around his return feels surreal, especially because Rivers himself once brushed off the idea of sticking around long enough to chase the longevity records of the league’s ageless icons.That moment came in 2020, when he first arrived in Indianapolis. He was 39 then, fresh off a long run with the Chargers, and reporters pushed him about how long he planned to keep playing. He laughed, shook his head and answered with a line that would age in ways no one saw coming. “I’m not going to get carried away. I don’t think you’ll see me in the Tom Brady range.” Today, Rivers is 44. Brady retired at 45. Suddenly, those words echo with new irony.What makes this comeback even more compelling is the full picture Rivers offered at that 2020 press conference. Courtesy of Colts.com, he said, “If I feel like I feel right now next year, then I'll be excited to keep going. Again, depending on how the team feels about that and etc.So, I don't know, I don't have a number on it. Like I said, I want to coach my son, my oldest son. I have two boys that are 12 and eight (years old). He'll be a sixth grader, so we have a little bit of time but that is important to me to coach him in high school. So, if that gives you a little idea.“I'm not going to get carried away. I don't think you'll see me in the Tom Brady range. But I am excited and feel like I can still help a football team go win a championship.”Since stepping away in 2021, Rivers has lived that plan, coaching his children and staying connected to football in his own corner of Alabama. Yet the competitive fire never left. JJ Watt recently revealed that Rivers ran an offense mirroring the Colts’ system for a high school team, and that he and coach Shane Steichen stayed in touch.The Colts explored a reunion in 2021, but this time the door swung fully open. If Rivers takes a snap on Sunday, he will join Brady, Vinny Testaverde, Steve DeBerg and Warren Moon as the only quarterbacks to start a game at 44 or older. It would be one more unexpected chapter in a career full of them, and maybe a reminder to Brady not to get any ideas.Also Read: Shedeur Sanders finally clears the air on viral “thong photo” as brother Shilo demands the real truth","Philip Rivers signed to the Colts' practice squad this week.

She followed with a grounded perspective, adding, “More blessings and whatever that means for me. Honestly, I'm rolling with whatever God has. I don't want to overthink anything or put too much pressure on myself, but I do believe this will be my best era yet. ”Her confidence is backed by a career that began at 19 with the release of “Goodies.” Since then, she has delivered platinum albums, shaped R&B and pop with her high-energy choreography, and collaborated with icons like Missy Elliott. Her staying power reflects a rare blend of discipline, creativity and consistency.At the event, she also spoke about navigating motherhood while maintaining a demanding career. “Oh my gosh. It's really hard,” she said with a laugh. She shared that her family was in New York during the gala. “But it's a good distraction, though.

Madison Beer’s Pinterest buzz and Justin Herbert’s growing spotlight

Los Angeles Chargers quarterback Justin Herbert and singer Madison Beer have been dating quietly for months, but their low-profile romance hasn’t stopped fans from turning every small detail into a headline. The latest spark? A set of circulating screenshots from a Pinterest board filled with bridal gowns, plus a playful comment from Madison Beer’s mom that sent the internet spinning.Although there’s no verified link between the board and Beer, the designs and the timing were enough to stir speculation. Add in Tracie Beer’s cheeky line, “Mother-in-law mode engaged,” and suddenly the internet is buzzing about a wedding that may not even be in the cards.The rumored Pinterest board features vintage silhouettes, satin trains, old-Hollywood cuts, and lace-heavy bridal looks, which fans immediately tied to the singer’s glamorous aesthetic. Still, Pinterest has long been a place where people save ideas without any real plan to use them, and social media users were quick to debate whether the board meant anything at all.Some brushed it off as typical vision-board browsing, while others treated it as a quiet hint that the singer may already be planning for the future.The noise grew louder when Madison’s mother added her playful “Mother-in-law mode engaged” comment on Facebook, leaving fans to wonder whether it was a joke, a slip, or something more telling. Even so, neither Herbert nor Beer has made any statement about engagement plans, and the couple has kept their romance away from paparazzi drama.Herbert is focused on his NFL season, and Beer is in her own lane musically, appearing at events yet avoiding relationship-centered interviews.For now, the idea of a Herbert-Beer wedding lives only in fan theories built from screenshots and assumptions. Until the couple confirms anything, the bridal talk remains pure speculation, fueling a narrative that says less about their relationship and more about how quickly the internet wants every celebrity love story to end with a ring.Also Read: Josh Allen's wife Hailee Steinfeld leaves fans guessing with unexpected move for Beau Society","Justin Herbert and Madison Beer have been dating quietly for months.

Antonio Brown’s attempted murder case becomes political as supporters claim he’s being targeted for being “MAGA”,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/antonio-browns-attempted-murder-case-becomes-political-as-supporters-claim-hes-being-targeted-for-being-maga/articleshow/125868981.cms,"Former NFL star Antonio Brown faces an attempted murder charge in Florida.

Brown denies the allegations, stating he acted in self-defense. The case has sparked debate.

Roger Stone defends Antonio Brown as his legal team invokes “Stand Your Ground” protection

Antonio Brown has faced legal battles, online backlash, and a spectacular fall from NFL superstardom in recent years. Now, a new twist has added fuel to the controversy surrounding the former All-Pro wide receiver. As Brown continues to fight an attempted murder charge in Florida, former political consultant and longtime Donald Trump ally Roger Stone has stepped forward to defend him and he’s blaming politics for the investigation.Stone’s comments quickly ignited debate across the sports world and beyond, suggesting that Brown’s support for Donald Trump has made him a target in the eyes of prosecutors.In a recent post on X (formerly Twitter), Stone praised Brown’s football legacy while rejecting the attempted murder allegations. “Hanging with probably the greatest wide receiver in American football history, Antonio Brown, who did nothing wrong. Brown has been targeted because he is MAGA,” Stone wrote, implying the criminal charges are politically motivated due to Brown’s vocal support of the former president.Brown’s latest legal conflict stems from a violent incident in May, when he attended YouTuber Adin Ross’ boxing event in Miami. The former Pittsburgh Steelers star has claimed he drew a firearm only in self-defense, saying several individuals attempted to rob him.He was briefly detained, released, and later faced a June arrest warrant that led to his extradition from Dubai. After posting a $25,000 bond, Brown was placed under level three house arrest with a GPS monitor.His attorney recently entered a not guilty plea and filed a motion to dismiss the case entirely under Florida’s “Stand Your Ground” law, which provides legal protection for citizens who use force in situations they believe threaten their safety.The case has polarized public opinion, with sports personalities like Skip Bayless lamenting Brown’s drastic downfall, saying the superstar once “turned himself into a first ballot Hall of Famer pretty fast” before spiraling due to fame, money, and social media influence. Brown’s future, whether in court or his public reputation, remains uncertain as legal arguments intensify and political voices take the spotlight.Also Read: Stefon Diggs sends fans into a frenzy with a knitted clue to his and Cardi B’s newborn son’s name","Antonio Brown faces an attempted murder charge in Florida.

He learned about her engagement to Travis Kelce on Instagram, just like fans. Sheeran later had a four-hour face-to-face conversation with Swift. He stated their long-standing friendship does not require constant online contact. Sheeran dismissed rumors of jealousy regarding their album releases.

Ed Sheeran explains how social media fed false tensions, and why real friendships don’t rely on constant contact

Pop music followers have spent months speculating on whether Taylor Swift ’s increasingly high-profile life, including her whirlwind engagement to NFL star Travis Kelce , has shifted her inner circle. One name that often comes up is longtime friend and collaborator Ed Sheeran. Industry chatter suggested the two might be on shaky terms after the timing of their recent album releases and Swift’s surprise engagement news.Yet Sheeran has now responded with something more substantial than a social media caption: he picked up the phone. And instead of drama, what came out was a long, sincere conversation that serves as a reminder that real friendship isn’t curated for the internet.Speaking to Access Hollywood, the singer revealed he had a major catch-up moment with Swift after she announced her engagement to Kelce. The twist? He learned about it exactly how her fans did. Without relying much on his phone, Sheeran discovered the news on Instagram, then later spent four hours reconnecting with Swift face-to-face.“I’m not self-conscious about my relationship with her,” he said, emphasizing that the two don’t operate like typical celebrity friends who constantly feed updates to their followers. “We’ve been friends for very, very many years… we lock back into where we left off.”Sheeran also seemed to dismiss rumors of jealousy or friction tied to their album releases. While reports claimed he was “peeved” that Swift dropped The Life of a Showgirl shortly after his Play album, he appeared more interested in the value of genuine connection than competition.“I kind of feel like being in touch with everyone, sort of you lose actual human connection,” he added, echoing a belief he’s voiced before, that his friendships are built on real conversations, not frequent digital check-ins.Their friendship, built on those long, private catch-ups; as he put it, sometimes “six-hour” ones, seems to have withstood fame, busy schedules, and media exaggeration. In a world where celebrity moments are increasingly instantaneous and transactional, Sheeran and Swift’s bond looks refreshingly offline.Also Read: “Call off the marriage”: Frustrated Chiefs fans urge Travis Kelce to dump Taylor Swift amid growing blame for Kansas City collapse","Ed Sheeran has spoken about his friendship with Taylor Swift.

Lawrence Frank clarifies Clippers’ decision on Chris Paul



The Los Angeles Clippers made headlines this week with a stunning overnight decision to remove Chris Paul from the team during their road trip to Atlanta. The 12-time All-Star learned of the move in the early hours and quickly shared the news with fans on social media.Questions immediately arose about the relationship between Paul and Clippers head coach Ty Lue, with some reports suggesting a silent feud had led to the veteran point guard’s abrupt exit.Clippers president of basketball operations Lawrence Frank emphasized that the decision was complex and deliberate, involving multiple discussions with Paul over time. While the team struggled out of the gate this season, Frank insisted Paul was not a scapegoat, noting the split was about fit rather than performance. The move has sent ripples through the locker room and the league, prompting clarifications from both Lue and Frank.Head coach Ty Lue addressed reports claiming he had avoided communication with Paul before the decision. “That's ain't true,” Lue said. “We were talking. He played. How he gon' play if I'm not talking to him?!”He acknowledged the split has left both sides not speaking since the departure, but stressed he had remained in contact leading up to the move.Lue also noted the locker room felt the impact of losing a leader of Paul’s caliber, and hinted that reconciliation is beyond his control. “You gotta ask Lawrence [Frank],” he said.Frank offered a detailed explanation of the decision, highlighting that it was not the result of a single incident. “This decision had nothing to do with one incident or one meeting that did or did not happen,” he said.Frank described a series of conversations that spanned weeks, emphasizing the emotional and logistical complexity of informing Paul. He acknowledged Paul’s significant contributions to the franchise and his legacy as the team’s all-time leader in assists and steals, but concluded that the fit was no longer right.Chris Paul joined the Clippers for a final season hoping to finish his career in Los Angeles, but after averaging 2.9 points and 3.3 assists in 16 games, the franchise opted for a decisive and controversial roster change.

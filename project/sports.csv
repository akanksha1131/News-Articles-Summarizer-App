NEW DELHI: Gukesh Dommaraju, the youngest-ever World Chess Champion, displayed his best version in classical chess during Round 7 of the Tata Steel Chess Tournament 2025 on Saturday in Wijk aan Zee .Facing compatriot Pentala Harikrishna , who also served as his second during the World Chess Championship against Ding Liren, Gukesh opted for the French Opening.Despite Harikrishna's strong start with the black pieces, he made a misstep on move 12 (Nfe7) after white castled early on move 7. Gukesh capitalised on this by exerting dominance in the centre of the board.The 38-year-old GM attempted to reposition his knight with Kf5 but only compounded his troubles, handing further advantage to the youngster.A critical moment came on move 20 when Gukesh's b4 posed a serious threat; however, Harikrishna missed the opportunity for an effective counter.On move 29, Harikrishna captured a pawn with Nxe3, but Gukesh’s reply, Qb7—widely regarded as the best move in the position—steered the game decisively in his favour. The endgame reached its climax when Harikrishna resigned on move 45.With this victory, Gukesh climbed to the top of the Masters leaderboard in the 87th edition of the ""Wimbledon of Chess"", scoring 5/7.Meanwhile, Praggnanandhaa Rameshbabu faced Jorden van Foreest, a former Tata Steel champion. Playing Black, Pragg adopted the Sicilian Defense and skillfully countered the Dutch GM's solid play.A couple of strong moves from the Dutch grandmaster were aptly countered by the Indian GM. With the queens being traded off the board by the end of the 16th move, the game reached a stalemate.Sensing the deadlock, Pragg chose to shake hands and call it a draw, maintaining his position as co-leader of the Masters, with the same points as Gukesh and Nodirbek Abdusattorov.While Gukesh and Pragg had a good day in the office, Arjun Erigaisi 's poor run in the tournament continued as he suffered a heavy loss to Dutchman Max Warmerdam.Playing the Sicilian Defense with the black pieces, Arjun made several early mistakes, giving Max some breathing space. Despite trying to remain compact in the centre of the board for a long time, Arjun took Max's bait and sacrificed his rook with his own rook on the 29th move, which proved fatal for the Indian.Although he showed some resistance with the queen, Arjun resigned with his queen still on the board, and the Indian GM currently finds himself at the bottom of the Masters standings.Elsewhere, Leon Luke Mendonca held off defending champion Wei Yi in a 40-move draw. Notable games included draws between Anish Giri and Abdusattorov, as well as Fabiano Caruana and Alexey Sarana. Vladimir Fedoseev rebounded from a previous loss to secure a victory against Germany’s Vincent Keymer.In the Challengers section, Divya Deshmukh fell to China's rising star Miaoyi Lu, while Vaishali Rameshbabu maintained her strong form with a hard-fought draw against Arthur Pijpers. Thai Dai Van Nguyen and Erwin l'Ami retained the lead in this section with 5/7.","Gukesh Dommaraju defeats Pentala Harikrishna in Tata Steel Chess Tournament 2025.

Road to the final for Aryna Sabalenka

Road to the final for Madison Keys

Milestones to be achieved

Sabalenka is aiming for a historic three-peat at the Australian Open, a feat last accomplished by Hingis from 1997 to 1999. A victory would also give her a fourth Grand Slam title.

If successful, Sabalenka would become the first woman to win three consecutive hard-court Grand Slam titles this century, following Hingis, who won the 1997 Australian Open, the 1997 US Open, and the 1998 Australian Open. Only three women in the Open Era have achieved three consecutive hard-court majors, and Sabalenka could join Graf, Seles, and Hingis in this exclusive club.

On the other hand, Keys is vying to become the first first-time Grand Slam singles champion since Coco Gauff at the 2023 US Open. This would be her second title of the season and her tenth overall.

Having already defeated No. 2 Swiatek, Keys aims to become the first player to beat both the World No. 1 and No. 2 in a Grand Slam since Svetlana Kuznetsova at the 2009 Roland Garros and the first at the Australian Open since Serena Williams in 2005.

NEW DELHI: Novak Djokovic 's quest for a record-breaking 25th Grand Slam title ended prematurely as he retired injured during his Australian Open semi-final against Alexander Zverev on Friday.The 37-year-old Serbian star, who had his upper left leg heavily taped following an injury in the quarter-finals, called it quits after losing a grueling first set 7-6 (7/5).Djokovic's exit from the court was met with a mix of boos and applause from the crowd, as Zverev advanced to his first Melbourne final.This marks the fifth consecutive Grand Slam where Djokovic has failed to secure the title he needs to surpass Margaret Court's record of 24 Grand Slam victories.His last Grand Slam triumph came at the 2023 US Open, raising doubts about his ability to overtake Court's record.The defeat also denied Djokovic his 100th career title, a feat only achieved by Roger Federer (102) in the history of tennis.Zverev will now face either world number one Jannik Sinner or American 21st seed Ben Shelton in Sunday's final.Despite being a two-time Grand Slam runner-up at the 2020 US Open and last year's French Open, this will be Zverev's first appearance in the Australian Open final .Last year, Zverev suffered a heartbreaking defeat to Daniil Medvedev in the semi-finals after holding a 2-0 lead. However, he entered this season with renewed energy, finishing 2024 as world number two and winning more matches than anyone except Sinner, having recovered from a severe ankle injury.Djokovic's fitness was under scrutiny heading into the semi-final, as he required medical attention during his four-set quarter-final victory over Carlos Alcaraz. The Serbian expressed concerns about his physical condition before the match.""It's not like I'm worrying approaching every Grand Slam now whether I'm going to get injured or not, but statistics are against me in a way in the last couple of years,"" he said.""So it is true that, you know, getting injured quite a bit last few years. But I'll keep going. I'll keep striving to win more Slams. And as long as I feel that I want to put up with all of this, I'll be around.""Despite his renowned ability to recover, Djokovic's movement appeared unhindered initially, as evidenced by a 27-shot rally in his opening service game and his ability to save four break points. Zverev also had his share of missed opportunities, failing to convert break points at crucial moments.The match remained on serve until the tiebreak, after which Djokovic ultimately retired due to his injury.",Novak Djokovic retires injured in Australian Open semi-final against Alexander Zverev.

NEW DELHI: After a rest day on Thursday, the Tata Steel Chess Tournament 2025 resumed full throttle on Friday. A dramatic Round 6 unfolded, with Indian chess prodigies making their presence felt in both Masters and Challengers sections amid the chilly weather of Wijk aan Zee .Struggling with three early losses in the tournament, Arjun Erigaisi opted for stability against the top-seeded American, Fabiano Caruana . Playing with the white pieces, Erigaisi opened with the King’s Pawn and steered the game into a Berlin Defense. The Indian grandmaster castled early.By the 22nd move, both queens were off the board, setting the stage for a balanced middlegame. Soon after, the players agreed to a draw through threefold repetition with 30 moves.It was Erigaisi’s third draw of the tournament. Caruana, also grappling with form issues, welcomed the result. For Erigaisi, the draw against a higher-rated opponent is a noteworthy outcome, but whether he can stage a comeback from here remains to be seen.Praggnanandhaa Rameshbabu began his game against the defending champion of the tournament GM Wei Yi of China with a King’s Pawn Opening, met by the Morphy Defense.Wei’s precise counterplay limited Pragg’s opportunities to launch a sustained attack. Queens were traded as early as the 16th move, signalling an imminent draw.The stalemate was eventually formalised after 58 moves, capping a game where both players achieved over 99% accuracy, according to engine analysis.With Gukesh holding Nodirbek Abdusattorov to a draw at the other corner of the room, Praggnanandhaa retains a share of the leaderboard's top spot alongside the Uzbek prodigy.Facing co-leader of ""Wimbledon of Chess"", Nodirbek Abdusattorov, India’s Gukesh D exhibited boldness with black pieces early on in a Giuoco Piano Game.Aggressive play defined the opening stages, but Gukesh’s 45th move (Kf8) allowed Nodirbek to seize the initiative.However, the young Uzbek’s 59th move (Re8) squandered a significant advantage, enabling Gukesh to fight back.After several strong defensive moves, a threefold repetition was agreed, ensuring Gukesh held the youngest-ever World Chess Champion to a draw in an intense battle.Leon Luke Mendonca salvaged his tournament prospects by holding Max Warmerdam of the Netherlands to a draw after a difficult start.Pentala Harikrishna shared points with home favourite Jorden van Foreest, a former champion of the tournament. Dutch No. 1 Anish Giri also drew his game against Germany’s Vincent Keymer.The only decisive result of the day came from Alexey Sarana, who secured a victory against Slovenia’s Vladimir Fedoseev in a strong performance.In the Challengers section, Vaishali Rameshbabu defended skillfully with the black pieces to hold Romania’s Irina Bulmaga to a draw. Meanwhile, Divya Deshmukh suffered a crushing defeat against 11-year-old Argentine sensation Faustino Oro.","After a rest day on Thursday, the Tata Steel Chess Tournament 2025 resumed full throttle on Friday.

CHENNAI: After laying down a marker in the series opener, India have a spring in their step moving into the second T20I against England on Saturday.India, playing a fearless brand of cricket, have been nearly unstoppable in the shortest format ever since head coach Gautam Gambhir and skipper Suryakumar Yadav joined forces. While Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and South Africa were decimated, England, under their new chief coach-captain combination of Brendon McCullum and Jos Buttler , are making an attempt to crack the Indian T20 code.England gave a poor ac count of themselves when trying to stop the Indian juggernaut in Kolkata, where the Men in Blue strolled to victory. The visitors should dish out a much-improved show in the remainder of the five-match assignment to pose any sort of a challenge to the high-flying hosts, beginning with Saturday’s clash. Here are some of the talking points for the Chennai fixture:Returning speedster Mohammed Shami will once again be a point of focus, after being surprisingly left out of the XI for the first game.Since there are only seven competitive fixtures left—four T20Is and three ODIs—ahead of the Champions Trophy, the team management does not have plenty of time to hand Shami a sustained run in the build-up to the global event. But if the thinktank decides to stick with the idea of having just one frontline pacer and three specialist spinners—Varun Chakravarthy, Axar Patel and Ravi Bishnoi—Shami may have to warm the bench again.Shami, wearing a protective gear on his knees, appeared fine on the eve of the encounter, operating along with pace colleague Arshdeep Singh.Spin is likely to have a say on a fresh black-soil Chepauk pitch. Considering the England batters’ issues against quality spin, India’s slow-bowling department will eye another feast in favourable conditions.“Back in Chennai in blues, I see it as a very important day for me. Playing for my country and in front of my parents and the home crowd will be very special. We will have certain plans, but I will also look to be instinctive depending on the situation. My role is to be aggressive and brave… keep bowling to the stumps,” said Varun on Friday.With Suryakumar recently reaffirming that Sanju Samson is the first-choice wicketkeeper, opener Abhishek Sharma has a lot riding on his performances.Abhishek will have a direct competitor once Yashasvi Jaiswal is back in the T20 scheme of things and must continue to deliver the goods to strengthen his case. The 24-year-old has recently let his willow do the talking with impactful knocks, including the free-flowing 79 on Wednesday.England must find a method to succeed while retaining their aggressive style of play. Making moves to square the series, England have roped in fast bowler Brydon Carse for Gus Atkinson, the pacer who was taken to the cleaners last game.",India beat England by eight wickets in the first T20I in Kolkata. The second match takes place at Chepauk in Chennai on Saturday.

NEW DELHI: Former Australian captain Ricky Ponting has advised the Australian selectors to include young opener Sam Konstas in the playing XI for the upcoming Test series against Sri Lanka in Galle.With Australia having already secured a spot in the ICC World Test Championship final against South Africa, they can approach the Sri Lanka series with a relaxed mindset.Ponting believes that Konstas, who impressed during his debut against India in the Boxing Day Test, should be given an opportunity to gain valuable experience in the challenging Sri Lankan conditions.""I think they will pick Konstas and I think they should pick Konstas. He is the one they have identified, he has hit the ground running here in his first innings as well. He provided a lot of entertainment and a lot of buzz around that whole series (against India),"" Ponting told Sydney Morning Herald .""I think they need to play him, to be honest. It is a hard place to play and a hard place to win. It will be a hard place to bat for all of our guys, but especially some of the younger guys who have not experienced those conditions much in the past. But I think they should pick him, it will be a great learning experience for him.""The 19-year-old showcased positive intent and the ability to unsettle the Indian bowlers, scoring 113 runs in four innings.While Australia is considering shuffling their batting order to accommodate the spin-friendly conditions in Sri Lanka, with Travis Head potentially opening alongside Usman Khawaja , Ponting emphasised the importance of investing in Konstas' Test career.""I would be picking him if I was a selector,"" he added. ""I think the order will stay the same. I think it will be the same with the option they have is maybe playing another spinner. They will have Beau Webster there who will give the seam-up overs, one of the quicks is going to miss out, so Cooper Connolly might find himself in a 7 or 8 batting spot and bowling a few overs as well.""","Former Australian captain Ricky Ponting has advised the Australian selectors to include young opener Sam Konstas in the playing XI for the upcoming Test series against Sri Lanka.

CHENNAI: Stars returning to play domestic tournaments has been the hot topic of discussion in Indian cricket of late, especially with coach Gautam Gambhir and the BCCI making it clear that domestic outings are a must for those who want to play for India.Varun Chakravarthy , a key component of India’s T20I set-up, on Friday echoed Gambhir’s views, emphasising that consistently featuring for his state side Tamil Nadu in white-ball competitions has contributed to his growth as a spinner. “Definitely, it gives me the rhythm (before joining the India team). The level in domestic cricket is extremely high. I would say that it is almost on par with the IPL and the international matches that we play,” said Varun on the eve of the second India-England T20I here.Varun finished as the second-highest wicket-taker in the recent Vijay Hazare Trophy (50 overs) with 18 scalps in six matches and also shone in the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy (T20). “I would suggest to everyone to go and play the Mushtaq Ali Trophy as it is very challenging. We play on small grounds and I find it very tough playing the SMAT.“It (domestic cricket) has definitely helped me get better, be more instinctive and on my toes. It has also helped me to think correctly at the right time,” Varun said.‘Should be ready for all challenges’: Varun stressed that the bowlers must try to stay one step ahead of the batters, even though T20 has become a batter-dominated format with favourable surfaces and small-sized boundaries.“In T20s, almost everywhere, the grounds are very small. Bowlers have the challenge of bowling from smaller ends. We plan for that as well. If we say that the batters are looking to have an aggressive approach, that is how T20 is. I cannot complain or be shocked by their (England’s) approach. I am expecting it and I have certain plans for that. Let us see if they work.”The 33-year-old also said that he has been putting in the hard yards to turn into a multi-utility cricketer across levels. “I have been working on my batting for the last six to seven months. I started my preparation at Kolkata Knight Riders, with the help of Abhishek Nayar (current India assistant coach). That kind of helped me. There is still a lot of work to do.”",Varun Chakravarthy says playing for Tamil Nadu in domestic tournaments has helped his development as a spinner.

NEW DELHI: In a remarkable display of sportsmanship, the spirit of cricket took center stage during an ILT20 encounter between Gulf Giants and MI Emirates on Saturday evening.The incident occurred on the last ball of the 18th over of the Giants' innings when Tom Curran , at the non-striker's end, was involved in an unusual dismissal.Facing Alzarri Joseph ’s delivery, the batters ran a single to long-off, and Curran returned to his crease. However, believing the over had concluded, Curran walked out prematurely.The ball had yet to be declared dead, and a quick throw to Nicholas Pooran resulted in the third umpire ruling him run-out by the book.The confusion and subsequent ruling left Gulf Giants’ coach Andy Flower visibly displeased. Curran had not intended to steal a run; it was an honest lapse in judgment.While the dismissal was within the laws of the game, MI Emirates chose to prioritize sportsmanship over strict enforcement.They decided to withdraw their appeal, allowing Curran to resume batting. The gesture drew widespread admiration, exemplifying the true essence of fair play in cricket.Watch:This moment proved pivotal as Curran, joined by lower-order teammates, played a crucial role in Gulf Giants’ dramatic two-wicket win. He contributed to the final stages of their tense chase of 152 at the Sheikh Zayed Stadium in Abu Dhabi.Such moments are rare in the high-pressure environment of professional cricket, where every advantage can define outcomes. MI Emirates’ decision showcased that the spirit of the game remains as important as the result, reminding fans why cricket is often referred to as the ""gentleman's game"".While Gulf Giants secured a thrilling last-ball victory, this incident left a lasting impression, demonstrating that the values of fairness and respect can shine even amidst the most intense competition.This act by MI Emirates transcended the game, setting a benchmark for sportsmanship in modern cricket.","Tom Curran was run-out by the third umpire on the last ball of the 18th over.

NEW DELHI: Alex Hales and Sam Curran 's blistering knocks powered the Desert Vipers to a comprehensive eight-wicket victory over the Sharjah Warriorz in their recent encounter at the Sharjah Cricket Stadium.Chasing a modest target of 152, the duo forged a remarkable 128-run partnership off just 65 balls, effectively turning the chase into a one-sided affair.Hales set the tone with a blistering 36-ball half-century, while Curran followed suit with a scintillating 33-ball fifty. Their onslaught ensured the Vipers sealed the win in just 14.5 overs, inching closer to the play-offs stage.Earlier, the Vipers' bowlers laid the foundation for the victory. David Payne struck early, claiming two wickets, while UAE's Khuzaima Tanveer ripped through the middle and lower order with an impressive four-wicket haul. Jason Roy 's spirited 55 off 38 balls provided a brief respite for the Warriorz, but their total of 151/8 proved insufficient.The Warriorz had an ideal start, with Adam Milne removing Fakhar Zaman and Dan Lawrence within the first four overs. However, Hales and Curran seized control, initially cautious before unleashing a barrage of boundaries. Hales reached his half-century with three consecutive sixes, whileCurran hammered Adam Zampa and Tim Southee, sealing the deal for the Vipers.Player of the Match, Khuzaima Tanveer said:Whenever I play cricket, I truly enjoy it without feeling any pressure. The captain gave me a clear plan to hit the deck hard, and I simply executed it, which led to taking wickets. Overall, I'm really enjoying my time out there""Sharjah Warriorz captain Tim Southee said: ""We got ourselves into a good position but lost too many wickets in the back half. We've shown glimpses of quality but haven’t been able to string enough together. With four games left, the equation is pretty simple. It was tough in the first few overs, and we needed to take regular wickets. On a positive note, it was great to see Jason Roy back in form""In the first innings, Payne's early breakthroughs left the Warriorz searching for stability. Tom Kohler-Cadmore and Roy responded with intent, building a 50-run partnership before Wanindu Hasaranga dismissed Kohler-Cadmore for 42.Roy continued to lead the charge, reaching his half-century in 35 balls, but his dismissal in the 17th over derailed the death overs.Tanveer's decisive spell dismantled the middle and lower order, while Ashton Agar's late cameo pushed the total to 151/8. Ultimately, the Vipers' clinical batting performance, led by Hales and Curran, proved too much for the Warriorz, as the Vipers inched closer to the play-offs.",Desert Vipers beat Sharjah Warriorz by eight wickets. Alex Hales and Sam Curran hit 128-run partnership in chase of 152. Khuzaima Tanveer took four wickets for the Vipers.

NEW DELHI: Jos Buttler displayed a semblance of resistance, but the rest of England ’s batting order faltered against India’s spinners, resulting in the visitors being restricted to165/9 in the second T20I in Chennai on Saturday.Buttler (45 off 30 balls, 2 fours, 3 sixes) played some elegant strokes, including a 4, 6, 4 sequence off Arshdeep Singh, who struck early by dismissing Phil Salt in the first over.Salt’s pull shot lacked the distance, and Washington Sundar , replacing the injured Nitish Kumar Reddy, held a straightforward catch near square leg.Washington added to England’s woes by removing Ben Duckett, whose reverse sweep landed in Dhruv Jurel’s hands, another replacement in the XI for injured Rinku Singh The pull shot continued to haunt the English batters, claiming Buttler and Liam Livingstone. Axar Patel (2/32) exploited the surface's grip to stifle England's intent, dismissing Buttler and Livingstone with well-directed deliveries.Brydon Carse, in for Gus Atkinson, provided late resistance with a fiery 31 off 17 balls, including three sixes. However, a miscommunication with Jofra Archer ended his promising knock.The highlight was Harry Brook’s dismissal by Varun Chakravarthy (2/38), who breached his defence with a deceptive back-of-the-hand delivery. Despite some late blows, England’s struggles against India’s spinners remain a point of concern.","Buttler (45 off 30 balls, 2 fours, 3 sixes) played some elegant strokes, including a 4, 6, 4 sequence off Arshdeep Singh.

Rahane showers praise on J&K seamers

MUMBAI: Mumbai may have won the Ranji Trophy 42 times, but Jammu & Kashmir can claim some serious bragging rights by saying that they have beaten the domestic giants in both their meetings in the Ranji Trophy, held in the space of a decade!Karnataka, who are the big boys of domestic cricket, are the only other team who have managed to have scored two consecutive outright wins over Mumbai in the Ranji Trophy-in the 2014-15 & 2017-18 season. Talk about J&K being the true giant-killers!On Saturday, J&K knocked off the remaining three Mumbai wickets for the addition of just 16 runs. Resuming at 274 for seven, the hosts lost their overnight centurion Shardul Thakur (119, 135b, 18x4) when he was caught at cover off seamer Auqib Nabi. Pacer Yudhvir Singh then castled Tanush Kotian (62, 136b, 6x4) with a superb inswinger, while last man Mohit Avasthi (4) was run out.Chasing 205, J&K were coasting at 112 for one, before they suffered a few anxious moments as their batters kept losing their wickets while trying to smash left-arm spinner Shams Mulani (four for 54) out of the ground. However, opener Shubham Khajuria (45, 89b, 5x4), Yawer Hussain (24) Vivrant Sharma (38, 69b, 5x4), Abid Mushtaq (38, 69b, 5x4) and Kanhaiya Wadhawan (19 not out) all made vital contributions to see their team home at the stroke of tea. Mushtaq, who sealed J&K’s famous win by sweeping Tanish Kotian for a six, added 48 in just 43 balls for the sixth wicket with Wadhawan.While J&K’s four-wicket win over Mumbai in the 2014-15 season at the Wankhede Stadium was historic, their five-wicket triumph at the Sharad Pawar Academy in BKC had a special taste to it as Mumbai, unlike the last time, were star-studded and the defending Ranji champions on this occasion.Considering the names on the Mumbai team sheet for this match, any opposition would’ve been intimidated. There was Rohit Sharma , Yashasavi Jaiswal, Shreyas Iyer and allrounders Shardul Thakur and Shivam Dube. Leading Mumbai was 85-Test veteran Ajinkya Rahane . And the man who walked away with the Player of the Match award was J&K’s impressive seamer Yudhvir Singh, who took seven for 95 in 23.2 overs (4-31 in 8.2 overs & 3-64 in 15 overs), troubling Mumbai’s star-studded batsmen throughout the match.After downing Mumbai, the unfancied J&K have rocketed to the top of the table in Group A, and, with 29 points in six matches, need to just log one point in their final outing against Baroda to secure a knockout berth.On the other hand, the stunning defeat has seriously jeopardized Mumbai’s chances of advancing to the knockouts. If Baroda (27 from five games), who are currently playing Maharashtra, gain a first-innings lead against J&K in their last game, Mumbai (22 from six games and presently placed third in Elite Group A) would be knocked out of the group league phase even if they win with bonus points against Meghalaya at BKC.The last league matches will be played from Jan 30, with Mumbai’s KO hopes hanging by a thread. “There’s still a one per cent chance for us to qualify. So, you never know. Our main thing is to learn from this game,” said Rahane.With scores of 3 & 28, Rohit couldn’t achieve much out of this outing. It didn’t help Mumbai that they had to drop talented in-form young opener Ayush Mhatre (408 runs opener in five matches, with two centuries in his debut Ranji season) to accommodate the 37-year-old and Jaiswal (4 & 26) for this match.Rahane, meanwhile, was whole-hearted in his praise for J&K, especially their bowlers.“Firstly, let's give credit to Jammu and Kashmir. I thought they played this game really well. They bowled consistently in the right areas and challenged our batting line-up, especially in both the innings, so credit to them. As I mentioned before the game, we are not going to take any team lightly and we didn't take anyone lightly. I think we were not up to the mark as a team, as a unit. They challenged us and played really well, so they deserved to win,” Rahane complimented.The Mumbai captain was especially impressed by J&K pacers Auqib Nabi (2-36 & 4-80), Umar Nazir (4-41 & 2-79) and Yudhvir, who took 19 wickets between them to demolish Mumbai’s batting line-up for 120 in the first innings, and restrict them to 290 in the second dig. Rahane admitted, though, that Mumbai didn’t expect the wicket to help the pacers to this extent, especially on Day One, when Mumbai were shot out for just 120.“There’s quite a bit of talent in their line-up, especially in fast bowling. I think this season they've been doing really well. We saw their fast bowlers’ videos. They read the conditions really well. Frankly, we didn't expect that ball to seam around that much. We thought it would be a good wicket to bat and it will spin on day two but obviously they bowled really well,” Rahane explained.",Jammu & Kashmir beat Mumbai by five wickets in the Ranji Trophy. Unfancied J&K have rocketed to the top of the table in Group A. Mumbai's KO hopes are hanging by a thread after the stunning defeat.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117556186,imgsize-47594,width-400,resizemode-4/117556186.jpg"

A dramatic opening day of the 2nd Test between Pakistan and West Indies in Multan on Saturday saw 20 wickets falling, as both the sides were bowled out in their respective first innings, leaving the hosts trailing by nine runs.Out of the 20 wickets that fell in the day, 16 were taken by spinners, which is the most by that type of bowling on the opening day of a Test. The previous record was of 14 wickets during the 1907 Leeds Test between England and South Africa.Spinners dominated the day from start to stumps, led by Pakistan left-armer Noman Ali 's 6 for 41, which included a historic hat-trick. It helped Pakistan bowl the visitors out for 163.It was then the turn of West Indies spinners, as Jomel Warrican claimed 4 for 43 and Gudakesh Motie took 3 for 49 to dismiss Pakistan for 154 before close of play.Pakistan's batting struggled as only Mohammad Rizwan (49) and Saud Shakeel (32) showed resilience, forming a 68-run partnership for the fifth wicket. The team's collapse from 119 for 4 to 154 all out saw them lose six wickets while adding just 35 runs.The opening pair of Muhammad Hurraira (9) and Shan Masood (15) fell to Kemar Roach's pace bowling, while Motie claimed the wickets of Babar Azam (1) and Kamran Ghulam (16), reducing Pakistan to 51 for 4.After tea, Warrican secured two crucial wickets: Shakeel, caught brilliantly by an injured Roach in the deep, and Rizwan, who was stumped.The innings concluded with Motie dismissing Salman Agha for nine, while Kashif Ali was run out for nought.The West Indies found themselves in dire straits at 38 for 7, as Sajid Khan 2 for 64 and Noman wreaked havoc with the ball.The situation could have been more precarious for the visiting team, but Motie's career-best 55 and his crucial 68-run partnership for the final wicket with Warrican, who remained unbeaten on 36 with two sixes, provided some resistance.Before lunch, Motie and Roach (25) contributed a valuable 41-run stand for the ninth wicket. Subsequently, Noman claimed the final two wickets, securing his eighth five-wicket haul in an innings.Following their 127-run victory in the first Test at Multan, Pakistan continued with their spin-focused strategy, with the pitch offering turn from the opening over.","Spinners dominated the day from start to stumps, led by Pakistan left-armer Noman Ali's 6 for 41.

CHENNAI: Manchester City ’s form has been poor to say the least. With the 4-2 defeat at Paris St Germain in the Champions League , City, also struggling in the Premier League , find themselves in a precarious situation. They have to win their final CL league match to advance to the next round.In the absence of defensive midfielder Rodri, City have lacked control and stability in the middle of the park. Former defensive mid-fielder Paul Lambert, who was a key figure in Borussia Dortmund’s CL triumph in the 1996-97 season, spoke about what Rodri brings to the table.“Losing Rodri was definitely a blow as he plays in a specialised position. Rodri played a massive role in City’s success last season and was rewarded with the Ballon d’Or,” Lambert said on the sideline of the Murugap-pa Youth Academy (MYFA) training on Thursday.Lambert further mentioned that many have been very critical of Guardiola, and he feels that it should not be the case. “In the last seven years or so, City under Pep have been incredible. While City are having a tough time, I do not think anybody can be really too critical.”Lambert had a huge role to play for Dortmund in his short one-year spell. The Scotsman was instrumental in keeping Zinedine Zidane quiet in the CL final against Juventus. After several years, when Zidane met Lambert, he said, “Paul Lambert. Ah, bloody hell”. Such was the influence that Lambert had in the title decider.",Manchester City have been without defensive midfielder Rodri.

A worried Mohammedan SC coach Andrey Chernyshov is standing in the middle of the Salt Lake Stadium practice ground, in deep discussion with club football secretary Dipendu Biswas .Not far, assistant coach Mehrajuddin Wadoo is talking on his cellphone. And inside the dressing room, club officials are busy trying to convince the players to come out the middle for training. In three days’ time, they are scheduled to play Mumbai City FC . But they have to make the journey first.This, in a nutshell, was the Indian Super League debutants’ first home training session on Thursday, eight days after holding Chennaiyin FC 2-2 in the league. Chernyshov’s boys are going through perhaps the best phase in their first season. They may be placed last in the table now but are unbeaten in their past four matches.Off the field, however, they are staring at a crisis, with the players threatening to boycott training reportedly over unpaid wages and forcing the club officials to step in to avoid a potential dressingroom revolt twice in the past 10 days. Ahead of the match against Chennaiyin FC on Jan 15 too, club officials had to coax the players to take the field. At the heart of this apparent player unrest lies a tug-of-war between the club and its investors Bunkerhill and Shrachi Sports over transfer of shares.Gurugram-based Bunkerhill, which invested heavily in the club since 2020 and played akey role in the team’s promotion to the ISL , owns 61% stake in Mohammedan Sporting Club Pvt Ltd. Bunkerhill is supposed to hand over 50% of its shares to Shrachi, which joined the company as an investor in Aug last year.It has been understood that Bunkerhill has sent a notice asking the club to transfer this 61% share (apparently promised as per the agreement) by the end of this month, threatening to suspend further funding otherwise. Shrachi, claiming to be “caught in a crossfire” between the club and Bunkerhill, has also stopped its funding in the company.This financial turmoil has left the players in a limbo — with some players reportedly claiming to have unpaid salary for around three months. Players of the club’s cricket team have also joined the protest, shooting off a hand-written letter to the club president alleging that they didn’t receive any payment for the ongoing season.",Mohammedan SC players threaten to boycott training over unpaid wages.

: Tears flowed unabashedly on both sides of the net on Rod Laver Arena. Ecstasy and agony.Madison Keys -- with an eight year gap between her first and second Grand Slam finals, the longest in the Open Era – sobbed tears of disbelief when she hugged her team, particularly her husband and coach Bjorn Fratengelo. For a while it looked like the couple, who got married seven weeks ago, didn’t want to let go, but the American had just clinched the biggest prize of her life, the Australian Open title, and her story might only have just begun.Across the court, Aryna Sabalenka , going for a historic third successive crown at Melbourne Park, had just fallen short, she was broken. She covered her head with a towel and sobbed uncontrollably. The world No.1, who had crushed 29 winners in the match, smashed her racket on the court after embracing Keys at the net.Keys, the 29-year-old, won the two-hour, two-minute final 6-3, 2-6, 7-5 and took home $3,500,000 while Sabalenka, who had secured the No.1 ranking by making the final, was richer by $1,900,000.Keys, the 19th seed, went on to give one of the most touching winner’s speeches, asking Melbourne Park to bear with her because she was going to cry.“I have wanted this for so long,” she said, clutching the Daphne Akhurst Memorial Cup, handed to her by the legendary Aussie Evonne Goolagong Cawley “I have been in one other Grand Slam final and it did not go my way and I didn’t know if I was ever going to get back to this position to try to win a trophy again.”“My team believed in me every step of the way, they believed in me when I didn’t believe in myself. Last year was so tough, with some really bad injuries, I didn’t know if I was going to be able to do it again,” said Keys, who’ll climb to No.7 in the rankings on Monday, matching her career-best number.“To be here and have this trophy, and my husband (and coach), who is looking confused over there, I love you too. I want to say thank you to every single person who helped me push on to achieve this dream,” she said, before looking at the crowd, “Thank you so much, I cannot wait to see you all next year.”In the title match, Sabalenka, who oscillated between going all-out and holding back, just a tad, for the first hour of play, broke loose just as the sun came down over the bay at Melbourne.The 26-year-old steadied the ship, mixing it up with some sweetly timed dropshots that caught the American short. Keys, who says Sabalenka’s play and mentality has been a reference point for her, held (2-5) to make her opponent serve out the second set and the world No.1 made no mistake.For Keys -- playing with a heavy strapping on her left leg -- it was the fourth straight three-setter, and the fifth of the championship, while Sabalenka had only dropped one set en route to the final. The duo held serve in the decider, going toe-to-toe for the first 11 games, until Keys broke in the 12th, on her second match point to claim victory.Sabalenka, known for her bruising play, was honest in her post-championship media conference.The world No.1 explained that she had crushed her rackets to get rid of her frustration before the presentation ceremony.Sabalenka said, for her, at this stage of her career, it was the trophy or nothing. “Nobody remembers the finalist,” she said with a laugh that didn’t quite catch her eye.“There definitely was a bit of frustration because I was so close to achieving something crazy,” she said. “I just needed to throw those negative emotions at the end just so I could give a speech, not stand there being disrespectful. I'm the one who knows that after tough losses, there are good wins.”Sabalenka, who left Rod Laver Arena for a few minutes, said she needed some time for herself.“I needed to switch off and forget. I was standing there saying, okay, come on, you've been in her position. She deserves that. She was a better player than you,” Sabalenka said before adding, “It was tough.”","Madison Keys beats Aryna Sabalenka 6-3, 2-6, 7-5 in Australian Open final.

That's not a problem for me. It's a motivation.""His sole encounter with Federer occurred during last year's US Open.""I would love to talk to him again,"" he expressed when asked if he anticipated a call from the 43-year-old following his Australian achievement.","Henry Bernet won the Australian Open boys' championship on Saturday.

MELBOURNE: Aryna Sabalenka is a towering personality with a ginormous game. The Belarusian’s USP is her ability to play high-voltage tennis at all times. Sabalenka goes mostly with instinct, but her game isn’t without tactics.The forehand cross-court, used to draw opponents wide, has given an edge to her returns, and has been perfected over the past year. Not enough is said about the 26-year-old’s flawless footwork, getting her into position to play her shots.Her play is so big, Madison Keys of the US will look to top that in Saturday’s women’s final, where Sabalenka will be going for a three-peat. The defending champion and world No. 1 thought it was just ‘crazy’ that she had put herself in a position to win three successive Australian titles and fix her name alongside the sport’s legends.Swiss Martina Hingis is the last woman to achieve that feat, from 1997 to 1999. It’s no surprise that Sabalenka, the Minsk-born Miami resident, called Melbourne Park ‘home’.“I feel good here, I feel the support, this year even more. I feel like I’m coming to my home slam,” said. “I know everything, I know every area, I know where to warm up so it’s not that crowded. I go (out) there and I feel people screaming my name.

After two hours and 36 minutes of breaking down Ben Shelton ’s incendiary play while battling cramps, world No. 1 Jannik Sinner turned to his team when the American’s backhand found the net on match point.Sinner grit his teeth and clenched his fist. It was that kind of a performance.The Italian came through 7-6 (2), 6-2, 6-2, making his second successive final here in a match in which Shelton’s level rode the roller-coaster — the 22-year-old had 55 unforced errors, which shouldn’t sum the match for him, but it does.The first set hit dizzying heights, just as well that the roof on Rod Laver Arena was open. The left-handed Shelton stepped up to the plate superbly, matching the world No. 1 shot for shot, meeting flat with flatter, spin with slice and pace with power.For 71 minutes and 94 points, it was hard to pick the numero uno and the 20th ranked player apart.The 22-year-old American broke early for a 2-0 lead, but the defending champion hit back and levelled at 2-2 even though he looked anything but settled on the court.It was Shelton then who broke in the 11th game and looked set to wrap up the set in the following game with two set points on his serve, but Sinner broke back and took hold of the tie-break and the match.Then, when the top seed jumped to a 4-0 lead in the second set, it showed that Shelton of the sparkling talent was still relatively new in the pro game.Shelton, who had the trainer work on his quads at the end of the second set, had the crowd on his side. From shouts of ‘Come on Shelton! Make America Great Again’, there was fair support for the World No. 1 too, lending to the atmosphere.Shelton had chances to break the Sinner serve in the second and fourth games of the third sets, but it was the Italian, battling cramps, who broke in the fifth game.At the change of ends, Sinner got his hamstring attended to by the physio. Sinner, clearly struggling with movement, decided to swing at everything and broke at love, before serving out the match.","World No. 1 Jannik Sinner beat American Ben Shelton 7-6 (2), 6-2,6-2.

It was that kind of a performance.The world No.1 came through the Australian Open semi-final 7-6 (2), 6-2, 6-2, making his second successive final here, in a match in which Shelton's level rode the roller-coaster, the 22-year-old had 55 unforced errors which shouldn't sum the match for him, but it does.The first set hit dizzying heights, just as well that the roof on Rod Laver Arena was open.The left-handed Shelton stepped up to the plate superbly, matching the world No.1 shot for shot, meeting flat with flatter, spin with slice and pace with power, for 71-minutes and 94 points it was hard to pick the world No.1 and the 20th ranked player apart.The 22-year-old American broke early for a 2-0 lead, but the defending champion hit back and levelled at 2-2 even though he looked anything but settled on the court. It was Shelton then who broke in the 11th game and looked set to wrap up the set in the following game with two set points on his serve, but Sinner broke and took hold of the tie-break and the match.Then when the top seed jumped out to a 4-0 lead in the second set, it showed that Shelton of the sparkling talent was still relatively new in the pro game, given that he took a flight out of the United States for the first time two years ago when he made the quarterfinals here on his tournament debut.Shelton, who had the trainer work on his quads at the end of the second set, had the crowd on his side. From 'let's go, Benny let's go', to shouts of 'Come on Shelton make America great again', there was fair support for the world No.1 too, with shouts of 'Come on Janeeeek!' lending to the carnival atmosphere.Shelton had chances to break the Sinner serve in the second and fourth games of the third sets, but it was the Italian, battling cramps, who broke in the fifth game. At the change of ends, Sinner got his hamstring attended to by the physio. Sinner, clearly struggling with movement, decided to swing at everything and broke at love, before serving out the match.""It was a very tough first set, but crucial,"" Sinner said. ""He wasn't serving at his best, not where he wanted to. We both returned better than we served. The first set was tense and I'm happy how I handled it.""Sinner's coach Aussie Darren Cahill is retiring as coach at the end of this year, and the Italian said it was great for him to be back in the final at Melbourne Park again.""There was a lot of tension today, I was slightly cramping. He was suffering on his legs too so I tried to move him around,"" said Sinner. ""These matches can go long. Playing three sets for two-and-a-half hours is a long time, I'm happy to finish it in three.""Sunday's final will see Sinner, the top seed, take on the No.2 seed German Alexander Zverev , who is also in his third Grand Slam final.Sinner said: ""We've had some very tough matches in the past, so anything can happen. He's an incredible player, looking for a first major. Sundays are very special days in tournaments and I'm hoping I can enjoy it.""",Jannik Sinner beats Ben Shelton in three sets to reach Australian Open final.

Jannik Sinner will meet Alexander Zverev for the men's singles title at the Australian Open in Melbourne, after the Italian defeated Ben Shelton in the second semifinal on Friday.Sinner secured a straight-sets win, 7-6 (7/2), 6-2, 6-2, to move into the title match, which will be played on Sunday.In the first semifinal, second-seeded German Zverev progressed to the final following Novak Djokovic's injury-forced withdrawal.Despite facing two set-points in a close first set, Sinner prevailed in the tiebreak and subsequently dominated the 22-year-old American, completing the match in just over 2-1/2 hours at Rod Laver Arena, despite experiencing cramps towards the end.Earlier, spectators at the centre court were left disappointed when Djokovic concluded his match against Zverev after dropping the first set, ending his pursuit of a 25th Grand Slam title.The 37-year-old Serbian player, with heavy strapping on his upper left leg, departed the court amidst some jeers from the crowd.Sinner, meanwhile, is now a step away from defending his first Grand Slam title, following his victory in Melbourne last year.Ahead of the semifinal, he held a strong record against the dynamic American, having won four out of their five previous encounters.The Italian's performance wavered in the first set, losing his serve on two occasions and requiring considerable effort to save two set points when Shelton served at 6-5. However, the 23-year-old dominated the tiebreak decisively, securing the first set after 71 minutes.He secured an early break against Shelton at the beginning of the second set and completed it swiftly in 42 minutes.Shelton demonstrated remarkable energy in the third set, unleashing powerful forehand winners while running as he attempted to change the momentum.Despite visible discomfort from what appeared to be cramp or groin issues, Sinner successfully defended two break points. When Shelton lost his serve to fall behind 3-2, Sinner swiftly closed out the match.","Jannik Sinner will play Alexander Zverev in the Australian Open final.

The Times of India in Melbourne

: Aryna Sabalenka is a towering personality with a ginormous game.The Belarusian’s USP is her ability to play high-voltage tennis at all times -- when ahead, trailing or even when struggling to get on the scoreboard. Sabalenka goes with instinct most times, but her game isn’t without tactics. The forehand crosscourt, used to draw opponents wide, has given an edge to her returns, and has been perfected over the last 12 months. Not enough is said about the Belarusian’s footwork, almost flawless, getting her into position to play her shots every time.The 26-year-old’s play is so big, American Madison Keys will look to top that in the Australian Open final on Saturday, where Sabalenka will be going for a three-peat.The top-seed and defending champion thought it was just ‘crazy’ that she had put herself in a position to win three successive Australian Open titles and fix her name alongside legends of the sport, including Swiss Martina Hingis, who is the last woman to achieve that feat - 1997 to 1999.It’s no surprise that Sabalenka, the Minsk-born, Miami resident, called Australia and Melbourne Park in particular, ‘home’.“I feel good here, I feel the support, this year even more. I feel like I'm coming to my home slam,” the world No.1 said. “I know everything, I know every area, I know where to warm up so it's not that crowded. I go (out) there and I feel people screaming my name, they support me. I have goosebumps every time they scream, ‘Let's go, Aryna’.”Keys, 29, seeded 19, playing her first final at Melbourne Park, and her second Grand Slam career final, applauded Sabalenka’s mentality.“She plays such fearless tennis, I think it's very unique,” Keys said. “A lot of people, if it was a tight point, you expect them to play a bit more conservative or back down a little bit, but you know she's not going to do that. It is not only impressive on her side it (also) puts pressure on her opponents -- you know you're always going to have to try to win the point because she's never going to just play passive and give you an easy point.”So supreme is Sabalenka in playing big that in her nine-hours and 12-minutes on court, in her run into the final, she has 132 unforced errors, while Keys who has two-hours and six-minutes more of court time has 202 unforced errors.Keys’ 193 kmph serve, which she clocked in the first round against Ann Li, is the second fastest in the women’s draw here, and her 28 aces also puts the American in second position, behind compatriot Coco Gauff in both columns. Keys’ average speed on her first serve is 170 kmph for the tournament, higher than Sabalenka’s 161. The Belarusian’s average speed on her second serve, however, is 134.2, higher than Keys’ 124.3.The 29-year-old, whose second serve has greater purchase, enjoys a better ratio of breakpoints saved, having saved 26 of 44 (59 percent), while Sabalenka is 18 of 34 (53 percent).Keys said Sabalenka was a reference point for her, given their similar styles of play.“The one thing I really wanted to try to be better at was not playing more passive in big points and trying to emulate the way she trusts her game and the way she goes after it,” the American underlined. “If you're able to do that and you miss and you lose, it's on your terms, it's a little bit easier to swallow.”The theme of the first Grand Slam final of 2025 is bigger and freer tennis. Watch out for the winners.",Aryna Sabalenka will play Madison Keys in the Australian Open final on Saturday. The world No.1 will be going for a three-peat at Melbourne Park. The 26-year-old Belarusian has won the tournament three times in a row.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117515864,imgsize-28986,width-400,resizemode-4/117515864.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Two-time Olympic medallist and one of India’s most celebrated badminton players, PV Sindhu has embarked on a new chapter in her career by teaming up with renowned Indonesian coach Irwansyah Adi Pratama .This partnership comes at a crucial time as Sindhu aims to regain her competitive edge and reclaim her status among the elite in women’s badminton.Previously, Sindhu has been coached by Pullela Gopichand , South Koreans Kim Ji-Hyun and Park Tae Sang, and Malaysia’s Muhammad Hafiz Hashim. Irwansyah, known for his success with Indonesian stars Jonatan Christie and Anthony Ginting, has been tasked with revitalizing Sindhu’s game.It has been a tough two years for Sindhu. After winning the 2022 Commonwealth Games title, she experienced a lull and didn’t win any tournament till her Syed Modi Super 300 crown in December last year.“Every player has been through something like this. What I’ve learned, I want to pass on to her. I’ll try my best. I believe she can still do it. She can come back and reach an even higher level than before. I do believe in it. That’s the reason I’m here,” Irwansyah said.“I want to help her enjoy herself more on the court. It’s important that she enjoys it because when she enjoys it, she’ll become more confident. That’s the main focus right now – working hard to get her to believe in herself again. After everything, the last two years have been tough -- injuries, maybe... It’s really about confidence. I’m doing my best to help her believe in what she has. She has a lot of potential,” the coach added.Irwansyah’s approach focuses on enhancing Sindhu’s natural aggressive playing style. “My plan is to make her a more attacking player. She has all the right qualities, so I just want to build on that and push her further. I want to change her game to be more aggressive -- more speed and power,” Irwansyah said.As Sindhu begins this new journey, she expresses a renewed sense of purpose and determination. “The bonding is important between coach and athlete. I’ve heard a lot about him, and I thought he is the right coach for me. The way he approaches opponents, I think it’s really good,” Sindhu said.At the India Open , Sindhu lost in the quarterfinals to Indonesia’s Gregoria Mariska Tungjung. Despite the loss, Sindhu gave a good account of herself, giving glimpses of her old self.“I need to maintain my speed. I need to have my power. The women’s singles game is evolving, and after playing for so many years, I think opponents definitely know my game by now. So, it’s crucial to strategize, having both Plan A and Plan B,” said Sindhu. “I still feel there’s so much more to achieve. I have that fire in me, and I know I can do it. It’s just a matter of time and rhythm.”","Two-time Olympic medallist PV Sindhu has teamed up with renowned Indonesian coach Irwansyah Adi Pratama.

NEW DELHI: One look at two-time Olympic champion Viktor Axelsen , and the word that comes to mind is: Imposing.Also known as ‘The Great Dane’, Axelsen is true to the moniker given to him. The 31-year-old Axelsen, after reaching the court, marks his guard and stands bang in the middle – equidistant to all his sides from the baseline as well as the side lines.It’s a sight to see, to witness how an elite athlete is a stickler for perfection. Even an inch matters!Then, standing in the middle of the court and aided by his long levers, the 6-foot-4 Axelsen retrieves everything you throw at him. Everything!The fact also is that Axelsen’s arms are really long. Just by taking a wide stance, he can salvage situations. Fetching the shuttle back from unthinkable positions. It’s not that he has to contort his body much, it’s just very organic.Axelsen is at the peak of his powers. His smash deadly. His reach sublime. His court coverage tremendous. At the net or towards the baseline, in the air or on the ground, Axelsen is simply irresistible.That’s what Hong Kong’s Lee Cheuk Yiu found out on Sunday at the KD Jadhav Indoor Hall in the men’s singles final of the India Open Super 750 tournament. Lee, a losing finalist in the 2024 edition, once again had to endure the same result as Axelsen won 21-16, 21-8 in just 41 minutes.“To be honest, to win this title is very special to me. It has just been a different feeling on court and different preparation. I am starting to feel like my motivation is back. I have competed tooth and nail this week,” Axelsen, a winner of the tournament in 2017 and 2019, said after another title win.“Since the Olympics, I’ve had a little bit of issues with injuries. And that has been affecting my motivation a little bit. So, to be here now and win the title means a lot.“This is a first one as a 31-year-old. But again, as I have said in other interviews, I was in my first final here (at the India Open) 10 years ago, which is crazy. So many things have happened in the last 10 years. But it feels very surreal to win this for the third time in my sixth final at the India Open. It is amazing,” added the Paris Olympics men’s singles champion.Lee had finished runner-up in the last edition and his dream of winning the title remained unfulfilled. The 28-year-old Lee made a good start, opening up a 6-3 lead in the first game.But Axelsen found his rhythm soon and gained momentum to go into an 11-8 lead at the break. Lee kept fighting but couldn’t pose a real threat as Axelsen blunted his attack with his retrieval skills. The Dane got five game points and converted one of them after Lee’s return went long.Once Axelsen pocketed the opening game, he simply ran away with the second. He moved from 10-6 to 19-6 with a series of booming smashes to dismantle Lee’s defence and complete the win in no time.The women’s singles final was also a one-sided affair with Paris Olympics champion An-Se Young of South Korea extending her dominance over Thailand’s Pornpawee Chochuwong with a 21-12, 21-9 triumph in just 39 minutes.The 2023 India Open champion came into the final with a 9-0 head-to-head record against Chochuwong and took control of the match in the initial exchanges itself. Young raced to an 11-4 lead in the opening game and then held 11 game points. The Thai saved three of them, but the gap was too big for her to cover.In the second game, Young took a 7-1 lead and then controlled proceedings perfectly to continue her all-win record in 2025 by adding her second India Open title to the Malaysia Open Super 1000 crown she bagged last week. The 22-year-old Korean hasn’t dropped a single game in her 10 matches this year.In the doubles events, Malaysian combination of Goh Sze Fei and Nur Izzuddin, who had ended India’s Satwiksairaj Rankireddy and Chirag Shetty ’s run at the semifinals, found a way past Korean pair of Kim Won Ho and Seo Seung Jae 21-15,13-21, 21-16 in the men’s doubles final.In the women’s doubles final, the unseeded Japanese combination of Arisa Igarashi and Ayako Sakuramoto capped off their giant killing run with a clinical 21-15, 21-13 victory over South Korea’s Kim Hye Jang and Kong Hee Young. This is only the third tournament together for the Japanese pair.Chinese second seeds Jiang Zhen Bang and Wei Ya Xin ended the run of unseeded French combination of Thom Gicquel and Delphine Delrue with a 21-18, 21-17 win in the mixed doubles final.Men’s singles final: 3-Viktor Axelsen (Den) bt Lee Cheuk Yiu (Hkg) 21-16, 21-8.Women’s singles final: 1-An-Se Young (Kor) bt 8-Pornpawee Chochuwong (Tha) 21-12, 21-9.Men’s doubles final: 3-Goh Sze Fei/Nu Izzuddin (Mas) bt Kim Won Ho/Seo Seung Jae (Kor) 21-15, 13-21, 21-16.Women’s doubles final: Arisa Igarashi/Ayako Sakuramoto (Jpn) bt 8-Kim Hye Jang/Kong Hee Young (Kor) 21-15, 21-13.Mixed doubles final: 2-Jiang Zhen Bang/Wei Ya Xin (Chn) bt Thom Gicquel/Delphine Delrue (Fra) 21-18, 21-17.","Viktor Axelsen beats Hong Kong's Lee Cheuk Yiu 21-16, 21-8 in the men's singles final of the India Open Super 750 tournament.

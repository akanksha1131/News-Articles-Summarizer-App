Shubman Gill not fit to lead in all three formats | Greenstone Lobo predicts

Poll Do you agree with Ajinkya Rahane's predicted opening combination of Gill and Abhishek? Yes, it's the best choice No, they should include Samson

With Shubman Gill returning to the Indian squad for the upcoming Asia Cup 2025, the focus has shifted to India’s opening combination. Both Sanju Samson and Abhishek Sharma have been in excellent form, scoring freely and keeping the tempo high. However, the inclusion of Gill, who has been named vice-captain, could see one of them making way.Former India captain Ajinkya Rahane believes Gill and Abhishek are most likely to open in the tournament. Speaking on his YouTube channel, Rahane said, “Shubman is back in the team, I’m sure he is most likely to open with Abhishek Sharma. Personally, I would like to see Sanju Samson in the team because he has done really well. He is a very confident guy, a very good team man, and that is very important.”Rahane added that while Samson brings great value to the side, it is probable he might miss out. “Sanju is a great team man, but that is a very good problem to have for the team management. In my opinion, probably Sanju Samson will sit out, though as I said, I would like him to play and be in the playing XI. But Shubman Gill and Abhishek Sharma will open the innings for the team.”The former cricketer also highlighted his excitement about India’s pace attack. “I’m really excited to see Jasprit Bumrah and Arshdeep Singh bowling together in this Asia Cup. We all know how dangerous Bumrah is.Arshdeep swings the ball both ways and can deliver both straight and wide yorkers,” Rahane explained.He further noted that the final spot in the XI will depend on conditions in Dubai. “Depending on the wicket, it will either be Varun Chakaravarthy or Harshit Rana.”Rahane’s predicted XI: Shubman Gill, Abhishek Sharma, Tilak Varma, Suryakumar Yadav (C), Hardik Pandya, Jitesh Sharma (wk), Axar Patel, Jasprit Bumrah, Arshdeep Singh, Kuldeep Yadav, Varun Chakaravarthy/Harshit Rana.",Former India captain Ajinkya Rahane believes Shubman Gill and Abhishek Sharma are most likely to open in the Asia Cup.

NEW DELHI: Cometh the hour, cometh Rinku Singh . The explosive batter marked his selection in India’s Asia Cup squad with a stunning century in the UPT20 League at Ekana Stadium on Thursday. Turning out for Meerut Mavericks, Rinku smashed 108 off just 48 deliveries, peppered with seven fours and eight towering sixes, at a breathtaking strike rate of 225. His heroics powered the Mavericks to a six-wicket win over Gorakhpur Lions.Chasing 168, the Mavericks were in deep trouble at 38/4 in the eighth over when Rinku walked in. What followed was pure carnage. He tore into the Lions’ attack, adding 130 runs off 65 balls with Sahab Yuvraj (22) for the fifth wicket, and sealed victory with seven balls to spare.Earlier, Gorakhpur Lions lost opener Aryan Juyal in the very first over to Vishal Chaudhary. Skipper Dhruv Jurel (38) and Akshdeep Nath (23) steadied the innings with a 45-run stand, before Nishant Kushwaha’s 37 lifted the Lions to a competitive 167.In another match, skipper Karan Sharma and Abhishek Goswami struck fluent half-centuries to guide Kashi Rudras to their third successive win, thrashing Noida Kings by 88 runs. Kashi’s disciplined bowling unit then skittled Noida for just 85 in 12 overs.Batting first, Goswami (50) and Karan (58) shared an 85-run opening stand off 60 balls. Shubham Chaubey chipped in with a brisk 30 off 18 to push Kashi to 173/6. In reply, Noida collapsed under relentless pressure. Kartik Yadav bagged four wickets, while Shiva picked up two to complete the rout.","Meerut Mavericks beat Gorakhpur Lions by six wickets in UPT20 League.

Sara Errani and Andrea Vavassori successfully defended their US Open mixed doubles title on Wednesday night, defeating third-seeded Iga Swiatek and Casper Ruud 6-3, 5-7, 10-6 at Arthur Ashe Stadium, earning a $1 million prize in a revamped tournament format that featured singles stars.The Italian duo secured their victory by winning four matches over two consecutive days in the newly structured event, which limited participation to singles-ranked players and wild card entries.The champions were initially uncertain about their participation in defending their title, as the tournament's new format allowed only eight teams to qualify based on combined singles rankings, with the remaining spots filled through wild card entries.Despite being among the critics of the tournament's changes that excluded traditional doubles pairs, the Italians emerged victorious after building an early lead in the match tiebreaker.""I think it was amazing to play in this court with so many people and I have to say thanks from the bottom of my heart for the atmosphere,"" Vavassori expressed during the trophy presentation.The tournament organisers had restructured the event, scheduling it before Sunday's singles play, hoping to attract tennis's most prominent players to participate.Errani and Vavassori became the first repeat mixed doubles champions at Flushing Meadows since Bethanie Mattek-Sands and Jamie Murray's victories in 2018-19.The Italian pair acknowledged they were representing numerous doubles players who were unable to participate in this year's tournament.""I think this one is also for them,"" Errani stated after their victory.","Sara Errani and Andrea Vavassori successfully defended their US Open mixed doubles title.

India Asia Cup squad press conference: What Ajit Agarkar, Surya said on shocking calls

NEW DELHI: Indian cricket icons Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli were briefly removed from the ICC ODI batting rankings on Wednesday due to a technical glitch, despite both continuing to be active in the format.The error drew attention as Sharma had only recently climbed to the No. 2 spot in the ODI rankings last week, while Kohli was placed fourth with 736 rating points. Their sudden absence from the top 100 created confusion, as players are usually dropped from the list only after retirement.Rohit has featured in eight ODIs in 2025 so far, leading India in three matches against England in February and guiding the side to five consecutive wins in the ICC Champions Trophy.Kohli, too, has played seven ODIs this year.Notably, the issue was confined to the ODI rankings, where both were among the top four before disappearing.The Test and T20I charts remained unaffected. While Sharma and Kohli have already retired from those two formats, they remain active in ODIs.""A number of issues in this week's rankings are currently being investigated,"" the ICC told Wisden.The anomaly was quickly corrected, with Rohit reinstated to No. 2 and Kohli restored to fourth place.

Who is Eberechi Eze?

Eberechi Eze is reportedly on the verge of joining Arsenal from Crystal Palace.

Arsenal are set to outmanoeuvre Tottenham Hotspur in securing Crystal Palace's Eberechi Eze for approximately £68 million, with the Gunners intensifying their interest following Kai Havertz's knee injury concern, according to reports on Wednesday in London.The 27-year-old England international, who was released by Arsenal at age 13, had been expected to join Spurs before Arsenal's late intervention matched Tottenham's proposed fee of £68 million ($91 million).Arsenal's pursuit of Eze gained momentum after Havertz experienced an injury setback, despite completing Sunday's match against Manchester United as a second-half substitute but missing Wednesday's open training session at the Emirates.Arsenal, who finished second to Liverpool in the Premier League last season, are looking to strengthen their title challenge while Spurs, despite winning the Europa League, narrowly avoided relegation with a 17th-place finish.Eze featured for 84 minutes in Palace's recent draw at Chelsea and participated in Wednesday's training ahead of their Conference League playoff against Fredrikstad.""Before Chelsea, I think many of you were surprised that Marc and Ebs started and played almost the whole game.Most of you will be surprised that they will start again tomorrow because of all the rumours. But again, they are committed,"" Palace coach Oliver Glasner stated at a pre-match press conference.""They are committed to the team, they have a contract here, they played a crucial part that we could be so successful, and they will play a crucial part as long as they are here. Because they are good, they are committed to the team, and when one of the players leave, which I don't know at the moment, then they want to leave as players who always gave 100 percent for Crystal Palace. This is what they did since they signed, and this is what we expect from them until the end of their contract, whenever this is. ""Palace captain Marc Guehi, who has also attracted interest from Liverpool, remains under contract until next year, while Eze's current deal runs until 2027.Glasner, who led Palace to Community Shield victory over Liverpool in a penalty shootout, addressed the ongoing transfer speculation.""This noise, these rumours, it's not just for three days, it's been written for weeks,"" Glasner remarked.",Eberechi Eze is reportedly on the verge of joining Arsenal from Crystal Palace.

Asia Cup 2025: India Squad Announced | Surya Named Captain, Gill Vice-Captain

NEW DELHI: The Ajit Agarkar-led BCCI selection panel on Tuesday announced India’s squad for the Asia Cup 2025, a decision that sparked mixed reactions. The team will be led by Suryakumar Yadav, with Shubman Gill named vice-captain. Among the notable omissions were Yashasvi Jaiswal and Shreyas Iyer Former India cricketer and selector Madan Lal expressed surprise at Jaiswal’s exclusion and also raised concerns over the handling of Hardik Pandya ’s role. The all-rounder has been picked in the squad but no longer holds the vice-captaincy—a role he last occupied during the 2024 World Cup.“Sometimes you feel surprised that a player like Yashasvi Jaiswal is not in the team...I don't know why Hardik Pandya has been removed,” said the 1983 World Cup winner.He further added, “But Gill is a good choice as he is performing well. In the coming time, it is possible that Gill will play in all three formats..The players who make the team win a match must not be left out. ..We have such a good team that we may win the Asia Cup .”Jaiswal has been placed on the standby list along with Prasidh Krishna, Washington Sundar, Riyan Parag and Dhruv Jurel.The Asia Cup is set to take place in the UAE from September 9 to 28, with India entering the tournament as defending champions.The squad also features Sanju Samson and Abhishek Sharma, who have built a strong reputation as an opening pair in T20Is over the past eight to ten months. However, with Gill expected to open, questions remain over Samson’s role at the top of the order.","India announce their squad for the Asia Cup 2025.

NEW DELHI: World champion D Gukesh was held to a draw by American wild card Samuel Sevian, while fellow Indian R Praggnanandhaa also split the point with Uzbekistan’s Nodirbek Abdusattorov in the third round of the Sinquefield Cup.For Praggnanandhaa, it was a second consecutive draw, but enough to keep him in the leading pack of three players alongside Fabiano Caruana of the United States and overnight co-leader Levon Aronian, the Armenian-born American.Caruana produced the only decisive result of the day, defeating France’s Alireza Firouzja, who suffered his first loss of the tournament. Aronian was held by Maxime Vachier-Lagrave of France, while Wesley So (USA) and Poland’s Jan-Krzysztof Duda also drew their encounter.After three rounds in the $375,000 prize money event, Praggnanandhaa, Aronian, and Caruana share the lead with two points apiece. A half-point behind them are So, Firouzja, Vachier-Lagrave, Sevian, and Gukesh. Duda is next on one point, while Abdusattorov finally opened his account with half a point from three games.For Gukesh, the first draw of the tournament came relatively smoothly with the black pieces. Sevian opted for the Rossolimo Variation against the Sicilian Defence, but the Indian teenager was always in control.The middle game passed without major complications as pieces were exchanged regularly, leading to an inevitable drawn endgame.Praggnanandhaa, playing with black for the first time after two whites, chose the Nimzo-Indian Defence. Abdusattorov, still searching for form, was unable to make much of an impression. The game simplified into an opposite-coloured bishops ending where neither side could press for more than a draw.The highlight of the round, however, was Caruana’s clinical positional win over Firouzja. Using the Fianchetto Variation against the Nimzo, Caruana secured a spatial advantage and better piece coordination in the middle game. After steady pressure, he pushed his central passed pawn to the seventh rank to seal the victory.With Grand Chess Tour finals spots on the line later this year, Caruana acknowledged the importance of the win. The American noted that while Vachier-Lagrave is almost assured of qualification, the rest of the field is still battling for the remaining places.Results round 3: Nodirbek Abdusattorov (Uzb, 0.5) drew with R Praggnanandhaa (Ind, 2) Fabiano Caruana (Usa, 2) beat Alireza Firouzja (Fra, 1.5); Duda Jan Kryzstof (Pol, 1) drew with Wesley So (Usa, 1.5); Maxime Vachier-Lagrave (Fra, 1.5) drew with Levon Aronian (Usa, 1.5) Samuel Sevian (Usa, 1.5) drew with D Gukesh (Ind, 1.5).","World champion D Gukesh was held to a draw by American wild card Samuel Sevian.

Poll Do you think the Karnataka State Cricket Association will meet the police requirements in time for the Women's World Cup? Yes, they will manage it No, they will struggle

Requirements set down by state police for M Chinnaswamy Stadium:

Provide parking facilities Separate routes for spectators Identify safe places for disaster management Install bag scanners at all gates In-stadium stakeholders to obtain a police verification certificate Real-time crowd-flow monitoring system Separate entry for women and children Permanent medical facilities Audit on fire extinguishers, electrical equipment and connections Separate entry and exit for players

In a fresh jolt to the Karnataka State Cricket Association's (KSCA) aspiration of hosting ICC Women's World Cup matches at the M Chinnaswamy Stadium, the state police department has identified 17 requirements that need to be met before the stadium is reassessed and declared fit to host international matches.According to sources, the police department wrote to KSCA on Tuesday with a timeline of 15 days to fulfill the requirements that were put together after the police department inspected the facilities at the 51-year-old venue. The checks and balances have been put in place after a stampede during Royal Challengers Bengaluru's IPL victory on June 4 left 11 dead.In the letter, reviewed by TOI, police have flagged parking, medical facilities, fire, women's safety, and security measures as key concerns. Given that the stadium is situated in the heart of the city, some of the remedial measures seem far-fetched. Incidentally, the stadium has been without power for over a month for failing to comply with the fire safety norms.According to the schedule issued by the International Cricket Council (ICC), the city is slated to host five matches, including the tournament opener on Sept 3 and the final on Nov 2.Parking woes are the first issue addressed in the letter. KSCA has been asked to provide both four-wheeler and two-wheeler parking facilities for spectators during matches.To avoid congestion on the roads, the stadium authorities have been asked to earmark drop-off and pick-up areas.One of the grey areas identified in the report is the use of footpaths for entry and exit, which leads to traffic snarls.Outlining the fact that many of the stadium gates are narrow, the report states, ""All entrances and exits shall be at least six feet wide with bumps, dips and steps repaired to facilitate easy entry and exit for spectators.""Addressing safety concerns, the report states that, since there are no designated safe areas in the event of an emergency, an area needs to be identified for the same. A requirement of baggage scanners at all entry points with CCTV coverage and a long-term backup has been laid down. For better accountability, setting up a real-time crowd flow monitoring system has been mandated.Medical facilities were a talking point in the aftermath of the stampede. Addressing the issue, a permanent medical arrangement as per triage rules has been recommended, along with an adequate number of ambulances, and separate routes for ambulances need to be earmarked as well.With a little over a month left for the marquee event, it will be a race against time for the depleted KSCA administration to put its house in order.","The Karnataka state police department has identified 17 requirements that need to be met before the stadium is reassessed.

The 38-year-old, India’s second-highest wicket-taker in Tests, stepped away during the middle of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy at the Gabba, leaving fans and experts stunned by the abruptness of his decision.Speaking to former teammate and India head coach Rahul Dravid, Ashwin admitted that the timing was deeply personal rather than purely professional. “I think it was just the time, and where I stood in my life, right? I think I was pretty old, I must admit,” he joked, before delving into the true motivations.The veteran revealed that the constant touring schedule and the frustration of being benched on overseas tours gradually wore him down. “But going on tours, and you know, having to just sit out a lot more, eventually got to me,” Ashwin explained.Yet the defining factor, he said, was family. “I mean, not in terms of not wanting to contribute to the team, but you're thinking if I would rather be at home, spending time with children.They are also growing up, and what am I actually doing?” he reflected, in what he described as a moment of clarity.Ashwin also disclosed that he had long set a personal deadline for his international career. “In my head, I always decided that I would retire at 34-35,” he said, adding that while his international journey ended, he was open to playing domestic cricket for its flexibility and balance.Dravid, recalling his own transition out of the game, pointed out that sometimes a temporary withdrawal from cricket can reignite passion. Ashwin agreed, stressing that he needed time away to “re-establish that connect” with the sport.",Ravichandran Ashwin will retire from international cricket in December 2024.

Poll How do you feel about India participating in the Asia Cup despite political tensions? It's a good decision for sports It's inappropriate given the situation I have mixed feelings

'Govt policy will put to rest all campaigns against India's participation in Asia Cup'



MUMBAI: Ever since the government has introduced its new online gaming bill, specifically the 'Promotion and Regulation of Online Gaming Bill 2025', there are fears that India's cricket industry's revenue could be badly hit. The Board of Control for Cricket in India , especially, has reason to be worried as two prominent gaming companies - Dream11 and My11Circle are its key sponsors. While Dream11 is the title sponsor of Team India, My11Circle holds the fantasy gaming rights for the IPL for the next three years.The BCCI , however, has made it abundantly clear that it will abide by the law of the land.""The act has just been discussed in the Lok Sabha today and the Rajya Sabha yesterday. It would then take a final shape, go through Presidential assent, and then there will be a 'date of appointment.' We will then read it, and then only we will take a call on whatever is there. The BCCI will not do anything which is not permitted by the government or by any law of the country. The BCCI will not violate any of the laws enforced in the country. That's very clear,"" BCCI secretary Devajit Saikia told TOI on Thursday.Explaining the BCCI's future course of action, Saikia said, ""Once the act comes into force, we will look into it, examine it and if it's permissible, then we will take sponsorship (from online betting and gaming companies), if it's not permissible, we'll not do anything. Take the example of cigarettes and liquor. Has the BCCI taken any sponsorship from the cigarettes and liquor companies once taking sponsorship from these kinds of companies was banned? So, whatever is permissible in the laws in force in our country, we will do that only.

India are supposed to play Pakistan at least twice in the tournament - on Sept 14 in the league stage and on Sept 21, in the Super Four stage.

Poll Will Sanju Samson secure a place in India's playing XI for the Asia Cup? Yes, definitely No, unlikely Depends on his performance

Adani Trivandrum RoyalsSanju Samson marked his return to action in style, combining with his brother Saly Samson to take the first wicket for his team in the Kerala Cricket League season on Thursday, August 21.Playing as vice-captain for Kochi Blue Tigers, Sanju made an immediate impact in the opening game. On the very first ball of the match against Adani Trivandrum Royals, opener Subin S pushed the ball to the off side and went for a risky single. Sanju swooped in with a direct throw to the bowler’s end, which was cleanly collected by his elder brother and team captain Saly Samson, resulting in a run-out.The rare sibling effort drew attention on social media, with fans celebrating the wicket as a memorable start to the new season. The moment also highlighted the leadership duo of the Samson brothers, who are aiming to guide Kochi Blue Tigers to a strong campaign in the league’s second edition. Adani Trivandrum Royals were bowled out for just 97 runs.The outing comes at a time when Sanju’s place in India’s T20 setup is under discussion. With Shubman Gill recently named vice-captain for the upcoming Asia Cup in the UAE, there has been speculation over India’s playing XI.Chief selector Ajit Agarkar had said, “The captain-coach will take the call on the best balance for the team. Once we get to Dubai, we will have a bit more clarity. With more options available now, Shubman has been in great form for the last few months. So has Sanju, so two good options, along with Abhishek.”For now, Sanju has set the tone in Kerala with a sharp piece of fielding, linking up with Saly in a moment that may well define the Blue Tigers’ season opener.","Sanju Samson returns to action for Kochi Blue Tigers in Kerala Cricket League season opener against Adani Trivandrum Royals.

NEW DELHI: Former India wicketkeeper-batter Dinesh Karthik has strongly questioned the exclusion of Shreyas Iyer from India’s 2025 Asia Cup squad, calling it a “tad bit unfair.” The BCCI on Tuesday named a 15-member squad, along with five reserves, for the tournament — but Iyer’s absence has triggered widespread debate.The 30-year-old has been in sizzling form. In IPL 2025, Iyer amassed 604 runs at an average of 50.33 and a strike rate of 170.07, guiding Punjab Kings to the final with six half-centuries. Despite those numbers, he found no place either in the main squad or among the reserves.Reacting to the snub, Karthik took to Instagram on Thursday and said: “Where is Shreyas Iyer? That’s the big question, isn’t it? How could he miss out? To a point, it’s understandable. He wasn’t part of the 15, considering how well Team India have done. 17 out of the last 20 they have won, so okay, continuity, fair. But not making him part of the other five players which you have earmarked for the near future with the T20 World Cup in mind?”Karthik further added: “Closing doors on him? That’s a tad bit unfair and I hope it doesn’t happen because he has done outstandingly well as a leader, but even better as a batter under pressure.”He concluded by stressing Iyer’s value: “It looks a solid squad, but again Shreyas Iyer, I feel, should have been part of the 20 for sure.”Iyer has played 51 T20Is for India, scoring 1,104 runs with eight fifties — numbers that only add weight to Karthik’s argument.","Former India wicketkeeper-batter Dinesh Karthik has strongly questioned the exclusion of Shreyas Iyer from India’s 2025 Asia Cup squad.

NEW DELHI: Under ominous black clouds casting their spell over Delhi’s skyline, the Subroto Cup, India's oldest national school football tournament, roared to life with its 64th edition at the Ambedkar Stadium on Tuesday.Despite heavy rain in the morning hours of the day, leaving carpets soaked and the turf damp, hundreds of students and army officers in the stands cheered on to undo the damage dealt by the weather.Olympian and Arjuna Award-winning shooter Anjum Moudgil, the guest of honour for the opening ceremony, drew an exciting comparison between team sports like football and something deeply individual like shooting.While shooting remains less accessible compared to team sports like football in India, she said that individual sports are more lucrative than playing for a team.That difference, she said, lies at the heart of how recognition comes to athletes.“Yes, they are different in terms of recognition. When you win a medal, obviously you get more attention than a team,” she told TimesofIndia.com on the sidelines of the Subroto Cup.The words of the former world number one in 50m 3 position rifle come at a time when Indian shooters are riding a wave of success.Manu Bhaker set the tone at the Paris 2024 Olympics with two bronze medals, while Suruchi Singh, Arya Borse, Arjun Babuta, Sift Kaur Samra and Elavenil Valarivan all made their mark at the ISSF World Cup of late.On Tuesday, Bhaker added another bronze at the Asian Shooting Championships in Kazakhstan.On the pitch, however, the first match of the tournament lived up to its billing.Arunachal Pradesh edged past Sainik School 1-0 in the junior girls’ category, thanks to an early first-half strike.Sainik School had two goals ruled out for offside, but the contest brimmed with spirit, making it a fitting start to a competition that continues to nurture India’s next generation of footballers.With the Subroto Cup bringing in yet another generation of talented footballers, and shooters continuing to collect medals on the international stage, India’s sporting future looks brighter than ever.The junior girls’ competition runs until August 28, with the sub-junior boys and junior boys categories set to follow.

What’s common between the three Formula E world champions

How the three World Champions fared in Formula E Season 11

Days after Oliver Rowland lifted his Formula E World Championship trophy in London this season, an interesting trend has come to the attention of Formula E and its fans. As a coincidence, all Formula E drivers who won the Mexico City E-Prix went on to win the Formula E World Championship that season, and this has been proved right for three consecutive years.Highlighting the same since 2023, a poster of three World Champions was shared on X by Formula E with the caption, “The trend continues. Each winner of the #MexicoCityEPrix from the past three seasons has gone on to become World Champion.”The special poster features 2023 Formula E World Champion Jake Dennis from Andretti, then TAG Heuer Porsche’s Pascal Wehrlein, who won in 2024, and the new World Champion, Nissan driver Oliver Rowland. All three of them won in the Mexico E-Prix and went on to lift the winner’s trophy in the Formula E World Championship that year.Oliver Rowland had strengthened his chances of winning the Formula E World Championship this year much earlier. He was leading the Formula E Driver Standings ever since he won Part 2 of the Jeddah E-Prix, which was his second win of the season after winning the Mexico E-Prix. In the last leg, the Nissan driver got nervous for a while as Pascal Wehrlein, who was following him in the number two position, closed the gap after grabbing quite a few podiums while Rowland had a dull period.Things became serious for Rowland when he failed to finish the Round 13 race in Berlin, while Wehrlein won second spot on the podium. But he eventually managed to confirm his championship in Berlin after four wins and three more podiums.Sharing about his bad race in Berlin, Rowland had said, “I was hoping before the weekend that the outcome could be [the World Championship], but after yesterday (Saturday) and this morning (Sunday), I was more worried that it might never come.”Also Read: Oliver Rowland reacts to daughter’s sweet radio message after Formula E Championship win: “It’s amazing” Things, however, changed for Wehrlein, who was pushed to third position after Nick Cassidy made a late entry in the Formula E Driver Standings by registering three consecutive wins.

Wehrlein registered one win and five more podiums this season.Meanwhile, Andretti driver Jake Dennis finished in seventh position in the Formula E Driver Standings.

Taylor Barnard on losing top three spot in Formula E World Championship

Fans hail Taylor Barnard for his fantastic rookie season

It was Taylor Barnard’s rookie season this year, and the NEOM McLaren driver put up a fantastic performance by temporarily making it to the top three in the Formula E Driver Standings by ousting the much more experienced Porsche driver Antonio Felix Da Costa.

Finishing P4 in the Drivers’ Championship and coming into the final weekend with a shot at runner-up is something to be proud of.”Also adding a note for teammate Sam Bird, as NEOM McLaren withdrew from Formula E after the end of the season, Barnard wrote, “@sambird_official it wasn’t the weekend you deserved either.You’ve been a huge part of my season both on and off the track, and I’m grateful for everything.

You always go above and beyond. ”Reacting to his post, a fan wrote, “An incredible debut season, huge congrats and excited to see where you go next!” Another said, “I know I said it the other day, but you’ve been incredible to watch this last year and a pleasure to support you in Papaya — there are many of us that can’t wait to support you in whatever you do next!” One more commented, “You were incredible all season around, Taylor.

We couldn’t have done it without you all — your trust and support have never been taken for granted,” he added.Praising the two McLaren drivers, he wrote, “Sam clinched McLaren’s first-ever fully electric win at the São Paulo E-Prix in Season 10, pulling off one of Formula E’s all-time great overtakes, before being waved across the line by none other than Emerson Fittipaldi – McLaren's first Formula 1 World Champion. While Taylor has been a rookie sensation in Season 11, securing five Formula E records, including the youngest driver to start a race, the youngest points scorer, the youngest driver to lead a lap, the youngest podium finisher, and the youngest polesitter. ”He ended the letter saying, “Some of us have been together since the day we first launched this team, while others have seamlessly fitted in along the way and flourished within the environment we have cultivated. For many, I am sure that we will cross paths again soon, but whatever the future holds for those here at Bicester, whatever path they choose to follow, I have no doubt that it will be bright.

How do Formula E and ABB work together?

What do ABB and Formula E say about the partnership?

After a successful Season 11, ABB and Formula E have announced that they will continue their partnership in the upcoming season. This gives ABB another opportunity to promote its new brand positioning via the ABB FIA Formula E World Championship, along with technologies that help industries take a cleaner route.Over a period of eight seasons, the partnership with Formula E has provided ABB a platform to showcase how technology can help industries outrun challenges, engage with customers around the world, and implement its own solutions into the series to improve reliability and efficiency. The partnership extension will provide a year-round opportunity for brand-building and activation, communicating ABB and its technology solutions to new global audiences, including Formula E’s international fanbase.ABB and Formula E will also join hands to engage a new generation of fans, collaborating with unexpected influencers and content creators to tell compelling stories that make advanced electrification and automation technologies tangible and exciting.The end of the mid-race car swap, a 150kW increase in power, top speeds that are 43 percent higher, and energy recovery increasing from 15 to 50 percent indicate how far Formula E technology has come to outperform on track.ABB has also built on its technical involvement in the series, supplying the race chargers from Season 9, and introducing its ABB Ability OPTIMAX® energy management software (Season 9) and Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) technology (Season 5) to the sport.ABB Head of Brand Paco Liebrand said, “We are pleased to be continuing our partnership with Formula E which, like ABB, is striving for a leaner and cleaner future. The synergy between the two organizations, combined with the global appeal of the Championship, makes it a great platform to promote our brand positioning.”He further said, “Formula E is increasingly working with content creators, influencers, and celebrities, with initiatives such as the Evo Sessions making an impact through digital channels beyond the racing itself, which is also an essential part of ABB’s new brand strategy. Going forward, we will be enhancing the way we harness the benefits of this collaboration, ensuring the focus is on delivering content and activations that reinforce our new messaging, build familiarity, and tell the ‘Engineered to Outrun’ story. ”Formula E Chief Revenue Officer Tiziana Di Gioia said, “Our renewed partnership with ABB is a testament to the commercial power and benefit of Formula E as a global platform that drives both brand and business growth. ABB, like our wider partnership portfolio, has and continues to see enormous value in collaborating with the fastest-growing motorsport on the planet, with viewership, commercial integration, and brand storytelling continuing to accelerate. Over eight seasons, ABB has moved from brand visibility to brand activation—integrating deeply into the fan experience, the sport’s ecosystem, and our innovation narrative.Also Read: Antonio Felix Da Costa shares happy memories as Porsche wins Formula E Teams and Manufacturers’ World Championships “This next chapter elevates the partnership even further.

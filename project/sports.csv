'Meticulous' is the word which former India batting coach Vikram Rathour generously uses when he talks about Dhruv Jurel. Rathour has seen the 24-year-old closely — first in the Indian dressing room and then with the Rajasthan Royals (RR) in the Indian Premier League ( IPL ).“Great work ethic. Very sincere guy. Nice kid. Very nice to speak to. Understands his cricket. Very intelligent as far as his game is concerned,” Rathour says in a freewheeling chat withabout Jurel.Jurel had played only 15 first-class matches, with a highest score of 249 against a weak Nagaland side. But there was something about him that caught the eye of the Indian selection panel, headed by Ajit Agarkar, and he received his maiden call-up. Rishabh Pant was still recovering from a horrific car accident, KS Bharat played the first two Tests against England, and then in Rajkot, Jurel got his chance.“Rajkot was the first time I saw him play. And then in Ranchi, he played a fantastic knock, that partnership with Kuldeep (Yadav) was phenomenal. In that series, a couple of knocks he played were incredible. The chase in Ranchi is something I will always remember. It was difficult conditions, we were under pressure, and the series was on the line,” recalls Rathour.Jurel burst onto the scene during the 2020 Under-19 World Cup and then had a breakthrough campaign as a finisher in IPL 2023.But Rathour explains how adapting to the longer format wasn’t an easy transition.“In that England series, he showed great temperament and great technique. Somebody who I could see wants to work hard. He kept pushing for more batting, more batting. Even before the start of the day, he wanted to come early and bat in the nets. And then I got the chance to work with him at RR as well. He’s somebody who has really good technique, a great mindset, and works very hard on his game,” says Rathour.Rathour feels Jurel’s wicketkeeping is as good as former India gloveman Wriddhiman Saha’s. One of the coaches, who wished to not be named, has worked with Jurel from his formative years agrees.“Jurel is unbelievable. He is at Saha’s level. He is a next-level keeper. Against spin, he is probably the best keeper in India. And against fast bowling, he is absolutely unbelievable,” the coach tells TimesofIndia.com.“At the trials, I got him confused with Aryan Juyal. I had to see his video again. He hit an inside-out shot over covers and I was sold,” says the coach.“Honestly, whether it was Sanju Samson all those years ago, or Riyan Parag and Yashasvi Jaiswal recently. All of them I picked based on one shot. I can remember the shots even today. Jaiswal came in and flicked the first ball over fine leg. Riyan Parag hit a six over mid-wicket. Sanju pulled the first ball for a six in Jaipur. That shot Jurel hit showed the spark in him. The rest of the innings was okay, not outstanding, but that shot stayed in my head,” he adds.Talegaon is a small village about 100 kilometres from Nagpur, in Maharashtra’s Wardha district, a region often mentioned for its distressing farmer suicide rates. The only trace of industry here involves crafting iron goods such as knives, daggers, and kitchen tools.From this unlikely setting, where Rajasthan Royals have their training base, where the RR coaches helped shape one of India’s brightest young stars. Jurel spent countless weeks and months in Talegaon, sharpening his skills much like the blades the village is known for.“Jurel was completely different. We had to change everything. The good thing was that we started from scratch because we had the time, he wasn’t playing in the side, so we could completely restructure him,” says the coach.“You see his back-lift, how he takes the first step in his pre-movement, everything has been meticulously planned.“It was planned for a proper three years. For example, even when he came into the Indian side and almost scored a hundred against England in Ranchi, three days before that Test, he was at our academy. We set up this practice session for him where he batted for 130 overs in two hours and twenty minutes.“We still talk about that. He says, ‘Sir, no one believes me that I’ve done this much.’ I told him to leave it, only he knows how much he improved in that one session. He went from 50–60% to 80%,” he recalls.Like Rathour, one of Jurel's coaches praises the 24-year-old's work ethic, his hunger for improvement, and compares his temperament to Rahul Dravid’s.“His work ethic is out of this world. He can just keep going. He reminds me of Rahul Dravid with that level of discipline. He’ll keep batting for hours,” he says.In the ongoing West Indies series, Jurel got another chance as Rishabh Pant was yet to recover from his injury, and the Agra lad grabbed the opportunity with both hands, slamming his maiden Test century at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad.Before the series, he had an incredible outing against Australia A, scoring 140, 1, and 56. In the first innings of the second match in Lucknow, he was trapped for 1 by pacer Henry Thornton.“Oh my god. He had to address that issue that very evening. He called, panicking ‘I’m not able to do this, I’m not able to do that.’ He’s an emotional chap; I deal with him very carefully. We addressed all those issues that day itself. I said, we can’t let this happen again.“So, we made some technical changes. There’s a lot of releasing of the back foot that he does now. If you see him playing straight or on the on-side, he keeps releasing the back foot into the ball. That helps him play shots down the ground, through mid-wicket and square leg — anywhere from mid-on to square leg. By releasing the back foot, he gets into a beautiful position. It’s something Sachin Tendulkar used to do when hitting down the ground. Sachin would always release that back foot beautifully. Not many people can do that,” explains the coach.The coach says Jurel keeps him on his toes all the time. “He asks difficult questions, a proper cricket nerd.”“He has an insane work ethic, and it’s helped him become the readymade product he is now. He’s putting in the work — morning, noon, and night. He doesn’t leave anything.“He’ll call all the time ‘Sir, is this okay? Is that okay?’ He keeps sending videos. In terms of the meticulous way he prepares, he’s the number one guy. Others check when something goes wrong, but he checks even when he’s done well. His video will come,” he says.With India going through a transition and the middle order far from settled, Jurel could be a solid middle-order option, with Pant donning the gloves.“Who knows, I think somebody like Jurel is good enough to play even as a batter in Tests,” says a confident Rathour.Jurel has every attribute to carve a space for himself purely as a batter — and as a keeper, he’s a superman, among the very best in the business.",Dhruv Jurel has been called up to the India squad for the first Test against West Indies. The 24-year-old made his debut for India at the 2020 Under-19 World Cup.

Poll What do you think about the confrontation between Prithvi Shaw and Musheer Khan during the warm-up match? It was unnecessary drama. It's part of competitive cricket. Teammates should resolve issues privately. I support Shaw's reaction.

The reason behind the heated fight between Maharashtra opener Prithvi Shaw and Mumbai all-rounder Musheer Khan on the opening day of the warm-up fixture ahead of the Ranji Trophy 2025-26 season has been revealed.Prithvi Shaw showcased his batting prowess for his new side Maharashtra by scoring a century against his former team Mumbai in a Ranji Trophy warm-up match on Tuesday. The 25-year-old reached his hundred off 140 balls and shared a massive 305-run opening stand with Arshin Kulkarni. Shaw’s innings ended at 181, but not before a brief heated exchange with his ex-teammates.The confrontation occurred after Shaw was caught at deep fine leg attempting a slog sweep off Musheer Khan. Tensions flared momentarily with Mumbai players, but the umpire stepped in to calm the situation, allowing Shaw to walk off.Maharashtra were 430 for three at the stumps on Day 1.Cricbuzz reported that Musheer allegedly sledged Prithvi Shaw by saying, ""Thank you."" The send-off angered Shaw, who also tried to grab Musheer's collar and also swing his bat at the Mumbai player.""It's a practice match. They are all former teammates. Such things happen.It's all okay now and there is no issue,"" said Ankit Bhawne, the captain of the Maharashtra side.Having recently switched from Mumbai to Maharashtra, Shaw had already hinted at his intent with the new team by scoring 111 against Chhattisgarh in the Buchi Babu tournament.Shaw has 4,556 runs in 58 first-class appearances at an average of 46.02, scoring 13 centuries and 18 half-centuries, with a highest score of 379. In List-A games, he has 3,399 runs at 55.72 with a strike rate of 125.74. In T20s, his 2,902 runs have come at a strike rate of 151.54 and an average of 25.01. He was unsold in the IPL 2025 mega auction. Shaw was captain of the Indian team that won the 2018 Under-19 World Cup, with current Test captain Shubman Gill being the player of the tournament.Rated as a highly talented batsman from the start, Shaw made a sensational Test debut by scoring a century (134) against the West Indies in 2018 at Rajkot at the age of 18. He played the last of his five Tests (339 runs @ 42.37, including two half-centuries) at Adelaide (pink-ball Test) in 2020. He has featured in six ODIs and one T20 International and last played a white-ball match for India in July 2021.",Prithvi Shaw and Musheer Khan involved in confrontation during warm-up match. Shaw was caught at deep fine leg attempting a slog sweep off Khan. Shaw also tried to hit Khan with his bat in anger.

Rohit Sharma removed as India ODI captain, a glorious era comes to an end

Former Indian cricketer Robin Uthappa has endorsed BCCI 's decision to name Shubman Gill as ODI captain for India's upcoming Australia tour. The decision comes as current captain Rohit Sharma , at 36 years old, would be 41 by the 2027 World Cup.The BCCI revealed the ODI and T20I teams for the Australian series starting October 19. The series includes three ODIs and five T20Is.Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli are set to return to cricket following their last appearance in the Champions Trophy 2025 final. Shubman Gill will lead the ODI team with Shreyas Iyer serving as vice-captain, while Rohit will not captain the side.""He's gonna be, in all honesty, 41 when that World Cup comes around. Right? So, you gotta keep that in consideration as well. And for all intents and purposes, I think it's done with taking the decision when the stakes are low rather than when the stakes are high, you don't want another situation like what happened in Australia,"" Uthappa said on his YouTube channel.Chief Selector Ajit Agarkar personally informed Rohit about the management's decision to transition the captaincy. The change was implemented two years before the 2027 World Cup to allow Gill time to adapt to his new role.Gill, now appointed as ODI captain, focuses on the World Cup. India are scheduled to play approximately 20 ODIs before the tournament in South Africa, where Gill aims to secure the trophy.Uthappa expressed confidence in Rohit's abilities and hopes for his continued fitness to avoid uncomfortable situations.""To happen to Rohit Sharma, he's too good a player for something to happen to him like that again. So, maybe to avoid all those stuffs. Maybe, I don't know… You don't want an uncomfortable situation like that, and if he keeps himself fit, then no questions there. You know Rohit and Virat will be a part of that side,"" he added.""I don't see form kind of dipping that sense, but it's just about reflexes and does that work, and how those things work because right now, they are not playing a lot of cricket as well. The only cricket they'll find themselves playing is perhaps the IPL and One Day cricket, and perhaps maybe some domestic One Day matches if they do come by.""Rohit's ODI captaincy record since 2017 includes 56 matches with 42 wins, 12 losses, one no-result, and one tie. His 75 percent win rate ranks him among the world's top white-ball captains.Under Rohit's leadership, India claimed the 2018 and 2023 ODI Asia Cup titles, finished runners-up in the 2023 ICC Cricket World Cup at home, and won the ICC Champions Trophy in Dubai.Rohit's first major achievement as ODI captain came in 2018 with the Asia Cup victory. He contributed 317 runs in five innings, including one century and two fifties, averaging 105.66.His full-time ODI captaincy began in early 2022 after Virat Kohli stepped down. From February 2022, India won 34 out of 46 matches under Rohit, with 10 losses, one no-result, and one tie.During his captaincy period from 2022, Rohit scored 1,963 runs in 45 matches at an average of 47.87 and a strike rate of 116.84. His achievements include three centuries and 15 fifties.","Rohit Sharma removed as India ODI captain, a glorious era comes to an end.

Thoda afsos hai

Poll Do you believe it's worth moving abroad for better opportunities in sports? Absolutely Maybe Not sure No

NEW DELHI: Being away from home never gets easier. Every day, you stand in front of the mirror, wondering what your family is doing. The pain doesn’t fade, it quietly settles in. Your mother’s warmth becomes a few seconds of buffering on a video call, and your father? He watches silently from the sidelines.No one leaves home because it is easy. They leave because it is necessary. For better opportunities, better facilities, and a better chance at chasing a dream that refuses to let go. As Tony Stark says in ""Iron Man"", ""Sometimes you gotta run before you can walk.""For Indian basketball player Arvinder Singh , it doesn't stop at running; it’s about dribbling, defending, diving for every rebound, and keeping his balance not just on the court, but in life. And right now, he’s doing that not in India, but in Japan, thousands of kilometres away from his home in Barnala, Punjab.(I feel alone sometimes),” he tellsfrom Yamaguchi, his home away from home. “But I train every day, listen to music, go to the gym. That keeps me occupied.”It has been only a few weeks since he landed at Yamaguchi in Japan. Playing for Yamaguchi Patsfive in the Japanese B3 League, the Punjabi boy is leading a life that is simple, but lonely.“I cook for myself. Since I’m a vegetarian, it’s difficult to find veg food here. So I watch YouTube, try to make roti and sabzi myself. Sometimes my mom guides me on call,” he says, with a small laugh, somewhat suggesting that scoring a three-pointer is much easier than making a perfectly round roti.But this is what chasing dreams looks like when your home country doesn’t offer you one. India, despite producing players of immense potential, still doesn’t have a stable basketball league.“It’s tough. Leagues start in India but don’t continue regularly,” Arvinder says. “If we had regular matches and exposure trips, we would all be better players. That’s how we improve. Since that’s not happening in India right now, I accepted this offer from Japan to play here and develop my game further.”His comments, though, are not an epitome of frustration but merely a representation of muted disappointment, the kind that comes from knowing what could have been.Arvinder, now 23, has always been one of India’s most promising players.A product of Ludhiana Basketball Academy (LBA) in Ludhiana, which has been a cradle for budding Indian cagers. Growing up, he was a shotputter untill he turned 13 and a LBA coach Rajinder Singh, spotted him and requested his father, an assistant sub-inspector (ASI) in Punjab police to thrust the boy in basketball. And within a year, Arvinder was drafted in NBA academy in Greater Noida.The 23-year-old was also part of the Indian team that beat Kazakhstan, India's first in 27 years, in the FIBA Asia Cup Qualifiers last year. But the team couldn’t sustain the momentum in the main tournament as they finished winless in the Asia Cup earlier this year.“We lacked experience,” he explains. “All their players play in professional leagues regularly. Playing consistently against tough opponents gives them exposure. Their game vision and court awareness improve naturally.”It’s this understanding that brought him to Japan.But it’s not easy to fit in.“I’ve been here for weeks,” he admits. “Coaches and players mostly speak Japanese. But we have a translator who helps. A few Japanese players also speak English, so they help too. You also learn a lot from body language, and we use signs and gestures on court to communicate plays.”He laughs, but there’s a trace of fatigue under his smile. Loneliness is a quiet companion here.What hurts more, though, is the possibility that he might miss representing India this time in the World Cup qualifiers in November as a result of playing basketball in Japan. His Japanese club is against the idea of releasing him.“There’s a chance I’ll miss it,” he admits softly. “Our league runs for seven months, and the Japanese staff are very strict. Even if I want to go, I’d need to leave a month early for the national camp. The selection happens after the camp. If we skip it, we lose our spot. Going to India isn't possible right now.”Then, after a pause, he adds, “(It hurts a little). Playing for India is always special.”Still, he doesn’t sound defeated: “If you perform well abroad, you’ll always get your chance in the national team. I believe in that. I believe in myself.”For Indian basketball, nevertheless, some hope is left. The Basketball Federation of India, along with ACG Sports, has announced the country’s first-ever professional basketball league, set to begin in 2026.When Arvinder talks about it, his voice suddenly picks up hope: “That’s a big step. It’ll help players a lot. It’ll help the game grow. We’ve waited for this for so long.”And then, when asked what basketball means to him, he smiles. You can hear it in his tone.“Basketball has given me everything. Exposure, a job, a purpose. My parents are happy that through basketball, I’ve found my path and that I’m making the country proud,” adds Arvinder, who represents Railways in nationals.Somewhere between the bouncing of the ball and the silence of an empty apartment in Japan, Arvinder Singh is learning what it really means to ""run before you can walk"".ALSO READ: Exclusive | 'I tried to live as a man but couldn't': First-ever trans chess player to reach WIM, now French women's champion","Arvinder Singh is one of India's most promising basketball players.

Poll Was the third umpire's decision on Muneeba Ali's run out correct? Yes No

The Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) has confirmed that the third umpire's decision to declare Pakistan 's Muneeba Ali run out during their 88-run defeat to India in the Women's World Cup was correct and followed the Laws of Cricket.During Pakistan's chase of 248, Muneeba faced a delivery from Kranti Gaud in the fourth over's final ball that led to an lbw appeal.While she was out of her crease, Deepti Sharma's throw hit the stumps. Although Muneeba had initially grounded her bat, it was in the air when the ball struck the stumps, resulting in her dismissal for two runs after a review by third umpire Kerrin Klaaste.The decision sparked a debate, with Pakistan's captain Fatima Sana Khan contesting that Muneeba had no intention to run and had already grounded her bat.The MCC, as the guardian of cricket's laws, released a statement confirming the dismissal's validity.""A batter shall not be considered to be out of his/her ground if, in running or diving towards his/her ground and beyond, and having grounded some part of his/her person or bat beyond the popping crease, there is subsequent loss of contact.""""This Law means that if you are running or diving towards the end that the stumps are broken, and you ground your bat or person behind the line, you are not out if you then lose contact with the ground and the wicket is subsequently broken. Muneeba had grounded her bat beyond the popping crease after being hit on the pads, and her bat subsequently lifted. Isn't this exactly what the Law covers?""""The answer to that is no – the Law specifically only covers a player who is running or diving - and Muneeba was not moving towards her ground.She had taken guard from beyond the popping crease and at no time did her feet move back into her ground.""""This Law, which was introduced in 2010 and is sometimes referred to as the 'bouncing bat Law', is to protect a batter who inadvertently loses contact with the ground as they move towards the stumps, either with their bat bouncing up or just with both their feet being airborne through the natural process of running.""""It does not protect a batter who is turning for another run, overbalancing, or who – as in Muneeba's case – simply lifts their bat into the air. The third umpire was entirely correct to give this Out.""The MCC provided additional clarification about the type of dismissal.""It's a Run out – although she was not attempting a run, and it was not a No ball, the wicket was not broken by the wicket-keeper without the intervention of another fielder – it was instead a fielder who threw it. So the decision, correctly given by the umpires, is Out, Run out.""India posted a score of 247 and dismissed Pakistan for 159 in 43 overs to secure a convincing victory.","Muneeba Ali was run out by third umpire Kerrin Klaaste during Pakistan's 88-run defeat to India in the Women's World Cup.

Poll Do you think the West Indies pace attack needs a major revamp? Yes, they need stronger bowlers No, a few adjustments are enough

Former Indian cricket captain Sunil Gavaskar has criticised the West Indies bowling attack following their innings and 140-run defeat to India in Ahmedabad.The West Indies cricket team struggled in their first innings, scoring only 162 runs, with Indian fast bowlers Mohammed Siraj and Jasprit Bumrah leading the bowling attack.India demonstrated their dominance by declaring at 448/5, before dismissing West Indies for 146 runs in their second innings. The match concluded in just two and a half days.""In Ahmedabad, apart from Jayden Seales, the other two were simply trundlers, who looked more like net bowlers than international ones,"" Gavaskar wrote in his column for Sportstar.""No disrespect intended to them, but to see the first bouncer being bowled after half a dozen overs had been bowled made one ask, 'Is this really the West Indies pace attack?' Yes, bowling bouncers is a big effort, and on a hot day, it can take a lot out of a bowler, but it is a surprise weapon to stop the batter from moving on to the front foot regularly.""The second Test match between India and West Indies is scheduled to take place in New Delhi from October 10-14.Gavaskar expressed concern about the decline in West Indies batting quality, noting that cricket's uneven wealth distribution may be a contributing factor.""For a team that once boasted of the likes of the Three Ws, Rohan Kanhai, Seymour Nurse, Clive Lloyd, Gordon Greenidge and Desmond Haynes, to name just a few, there is simply nobody in this current team who looks like getting a million country miles close to them,"" he added.""Of course, I haven't forgotten the incomparable Garfield Sobers, Viv Richards and the 'Prince of Trinidad', Brian Lara.

The fitness transformation of Indian Cricket: From Sachin to Virat | Ramji Srinivasan Exclusive

Poll Is it smart for the Indian team to rely on senior players who only play one format? Yes, experience matters. No, we should focus on all-format players.

Former Indian chief selector Dilip Vengsarkar has raised concerns about the selection of Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma for the upcoming three-match ODI series against Australia starting October 19. Both senior batters were recently named in the ODI squad led by Shubman Gill.This series will mark Kohli and Rohit's return to competitive cricket since their last appearance in IPL 2025. Their most recent international appearance was during the Champions Trophy in March.The situation is particularly notable as both players now only participate in ODI cricket, having retired from T20Is in June 2024 and Test cricket in May this year.""Rohit and Virat have been great players over the years, but if you are playing just one format of the game, I believe the selectors need to take a call on this. I feel you cannot know or judge the form and fitness of such players because they've had a long layoff after the last game they have played. It's very difficult to assess their form and fitness,"" Vengsarkar told Mid-Day.""Rohit and Virat have possibly been picked because of their great records. They have been great players and have done yeomen service to Indian cricket , having won many matches in all formats of the game. But since they have not been playing Test match cricket as well as T20s, and are playing only one format, one-day matches, which is not very often played during the season, it's very difficult to gauge their form and fitness.But since they have been picked, the selectors may have checked that, though I don't know how.""Current chief selector Ajit Agarkar confirmed that both players passed their mandatory pre-season fitness tests. However, he indicated their selection for the Australia tour doesn't guarantee their inclusion in plans for the 2027 ODI World Cup.The upcoming series will be crucial in determining whether the selectors will consider them for future ODI matches against South Africa and New Zealand, potentially impacting their World Cup prospects.While both players might want to extend their careers until the 2027 ODI World Cup, Vengsarkar suggested a different approach for the selection committee: ""It's really up to the selectors whether they want to stick with Rohit and Virat or look ahead and give opportunities to those players who are available for all formats of the game. It depends on how they look at Indian cricket going ahead.""",Former Indian chief selector Dilip Vengsarkar has raised concerns about the selection of Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma for the upcoming three-match ODI series against Australia.

At 5am IST on September 22, Vaibhav Sooryavanshi called one of his coaches, who has worked with him from the his formative years from Brisbane after India U19's first youth one-day against Australia U19.""This boy drives me crazy,"" the coach told TimesofIndia.com. ""I asked him, ‘Vaibhav, it is pretty early in India, what do you want to show me?’"" the coach recalled asking the 14-year-old.The teenager turned the camera towards the ground and asked, ""Sir, ye light dekha apane? (Can you see this light?)""A perplexed coach replied, ""I have never been to Brisbane in my life, Vaibhav.""""After a while, I realised, 'Oh, he's showing me the bloody light over there in Brisbane.' And he's telling me, ‘Sir, look at this light ek, do, teen, chaar khamba hai (There are four pillars).’""A baffled coach asked Vaibhav to cut to the chase. ""Maine bola haan kya karu abhi (I said yes, what can I do?)."" Vaibhav got a bit annoyed and said, ""Nahi sir, main kya samjha raha hoon aapko? Ye chaaron light hai na IPL mey ek khamba mey lagta hai (No sir, what am I even explaining to you? These four are lights, right? In the IPL, they’re installed on a single pole).""Sooryavanshi's coach, still half-asleep, failed to understand his ward's point: ""I still didn't get what he was trying to say.""This got the teenager agitated, and he said: ""Arey sir, ball nahi dikh raha idhar (I can't see the ball while playing).""It left the coach smiling, and he replied, ""Vaibhav, sabke liye same hi light hai (Everyone is playing under the same lights).""He still doesn’t know whether his calming words helped the child prodigy, but if the scorecards are to be believed - they have made their mark and how! Vaibhav has set the Australian shores on fire.After playing brisk cameos in the youth ODIs, he smoked a century in youth Tests. The boy, who made his first-class debut at 12, bagged his million-dollar IPL deal at 13, and then made history as the youngest player to hit a century in men’s T20s off just 35 balls.Earlier this year, he hit the fastest century on record in youth ODIs against England at Worcester. He already has a big fan following. When he traveled to the UK, he was stopped for selfies at the airport, and fans reached the venue to get his autographs.Yes, it is only a youth international, but he is the youngest player in either squads by two-and-a-half years. He has looked at least a level or two above the rest.Amid all the glitz and glamour, Vikram Rathour, former India batting coach, who is currently with Rajasthan Royals , firmly believes that Sooryavanshi is destined for big things.""He's got a hundred in England, he's got a hundred in Australia. And you see what he can do in T20 cricket (IPL). Outstanding for a kid so young,"" Rathour told TimesofIndia.com.""He is a prodigy. But the great thing about him is that he's not flustered at all. It's not that he scored his hundred and suddenly becomes a big name in Indian cricket at a young age. Nothing has changed. He's still so grounded and comfortable with all this suddenly happening around him. That's a great thing to have,"" he said.Sooryavanshi's childhood coach echoes Rathour's voice and goes a step further, requesting the selectors to ""blood"" him immediately.""He should be blooded into the senior team immediately, like Sachin was all those years ago,"" he said.""They have to blood this guy immediately, boss, because he is in another zone only. At least send him on an India A tour. Send him to India A immediately. I'm telling you, this Australian attack that is here, bowling to India A guys, he would have got a double hundred,"" he said.The coach narrated a story from the IPL, when the teenager faced Jofra Archer in the nets.""He smoked Jofra Archer in the nets. Jofra Archer, when he bowls in the nets, he's a demon. He never bowls a warm-up ball when the batter is there. He absolutely charges in. And actually, Jofra Archer knocked off Steve Smith's head in a practice session we had before the Ashes. Smith was struggling against him. From that day onwards, he never went inside the net when Jofra was bowling.""When he was bowling to Vaibhav, I was scared, and this boy hit one shot on the back foot, and it went out of the stadium. All the coaching staff, even Jofra, were stunned,"" he said.Those who have worked with Sooryavanshi agree there are areas in his game that still need improvement. His love for mutton and rice is something that scares his coaches, but with a bat in hand and his six-hitting prowess, he excites everyone, and they feel the boy from Samastipur, Bihar, is a world-class talent—far beyond his years.","Vaibhav Suryavanshi made his first-class debut at 12, bagged his million-dollar IPL deal at 13.

England survived a scare against Bangladesh as Heather Knight (79* off 111 balls) and Charlie Dean (27* off 56 balls) stitched together a 79-run stand for the unbeaten seventh wicket to help the four-time champions to a four-wicket win with 23 balls to spare in their second league match of the ICC Women’s ODI World Cup in Guwahati on Tuesday.Opting to bowl first at Barsapara Cricket Stadium, England bowlers did their job to restrict Bangladesh to 178 in 49.4 overs.

Then Player-of-the-Match Knight, with all her experience, combined with Dean to take England home without any further hiccup in the 47th over and register back-to-back wins in the marquee event.Defending a below-par total against their heavyweight opponents, leg-spinner Fahima Khatun kept Bangladesh in the hunt with a magical spell of spin bowling as she returned with 3/16 from 10 overs. Khatun took three quick wickets in the forms of England captain Natalie Sciver-Brunt, Sophia Dunkley and Emma Lamb to leave England tattering at 78/5 in the 23rd over. She scalped Sciver-Brunt and Dunkley in the 19th over, while Lamb returned in the 23rd.Earlier, medium pacer Marufa Akter gave Bangladesh a perfect start by dismissing in-from opener Amy Jones in the very first over and the other opener Tasmin Beaumont in first ball of the 7th over, both trapped in front of the stumps.Earlier, No. 4 Sobhana Mostary (60) held the Bangladesh innings together as wickets tumbled at the other end. Opener Sharmin Akhter had made a struggling 30 but after that Mostary didn’t get any partnership going before Rabeya Khatun played a cameo (47*) in the end.

I’m sure he’ll probably continue for a couple more years, as long as the hunger is there, but KG will definitely go down as one of the greats of the game,"" Bavuma said about Rabada, who has taken 336 wickets in 71 Tests @21.74. Bavuma made the remarks while speaking to reporters on the sidelines of the CEAT Cricket Rating Awards in Mumbai on Tuesday.The 30-year-old paceman was instrumental in South Africa’s World Test Championship final win over Australia at Lord’s in June, taking five for 51 and four for 59 to finish with a match haul of nine for 110, bowling the Aussies out for 212 in both innings.“I mean, statistically, that speaks for itself. I was having a conversation with Hashim Amla a couple of days ago, and he spoke about Dale Steyn , saying Kagiso is at the same level as Steyn, arguably even a bit better.That conversation speaks volumes for a guy like KG,” Bavuma added.“Statistically, it’s his character that stands out — competitiveness and the hunger to remain the world’s No.1 bowler,” he complimented.Bavuma termed South Africa’s WTC final triumph a ""massive step forward"" for the country. ""We went into the WTC cycle aiming for the final. Once there, we wanted to see how far we could go. South Africa has had a lot of heartache in finals and ICC events. Many players are driven by that pain and want to achieve something different for the country. For a country like ours, which isn’t a financial powerhouse like India, England, or Australia, winning the WTC final speaks volumes for international cricket,"" he said.The victory was also a personal milestone for Bavuma, who had faced criticism about his place in the side. Bavuma, who has scored 3,708 runs in 64 Tests @38.22, contributed 36 and 66 in the WTC final.""It was massive for me as a leader. Coming in as captain a couple of years ago, there was doubt around my leadership. I was still learning my game and understanding myself as a person. There was friction within Cricket South Africa at the time, so as a young captain, it was tricky. From a team perspective, we wanted to be among the world’s best again, following legends like AB de Villiers and Hashim Amla. The journey hasn’t been easy, but the WTC win put everything into perspective,"" Bavuma said.","Kagiso Rabada will go down as one of the greats of the game, says captain Temba Bavuma. Bavuma made the remarks while speaking to reporters on the sidelines of the CEAT Cricket Rating Awards in Mumbai on Tuesday.

Poll What do you think is the main issue facing West Indies cricket currently? Lack of finances Player passion and commitment Infrastructure and facilities

'Great to see that Abhishek wants to play Tests too'



: The West Indies’ rapid slide in cricket came to the fore yet again when they recently suffered a crushing innings & 140-run defeat inside three days against India in the first Test in Ahmedabad. A couple of months back, against Australia, the Caribbeans collapsed for a sorry-low score of 27 in the third Day/Night Test in Kingston at Jamaica. Post that humiliating 3-0 series defeat at the hands of the Aussies, Cricket West Indies (CWI) formed a special ‘Cricket strategy and officiating committee,’ which included Caribbean cricket legends Clive Lloyd, Viv Richards, Desmond Haynes and Shivnaraine Chanderpaul.One of the points discussed in that meeting was arranging finances for West Indies cricket, with Lloyd urging the ICC to arrange a special fund for the West Indies. Lara admits that lack of money in the game was one thing holding back West Indies cricket, but the ‘Prince of Trinidad’ also points out that the West Indies players needed to play with more passion when they wore the West Indies shirt and cap.Talking to the media during the CEAT Cricket Rating awards here, Lara said, ""It (finances) is a problem because if you want to do anything, where back in 15-16 years ago, volunteerism was a big thing.You can get things done. You can get coaches. I was coached at Harvard coaching clinic where nobody was paid. So if you want to get things done, you have to have the capital to do it. So that is a major part. But at the same time, I would like to urge Roston Chase (West Indies captain) and the other guys to, do they have cricket at heart? Do they really want to play for the West Indies? And that is the most important thing because you would find a way. ""Responding to Chase’s comment after the Ahmedabad debacle that West Indies cricket was hurting because it lacked in infrastructure and finances, Lara said that greats like him and Viv Richards too didn't have any better facilities during their playing days, but played for the West Indies with passion, and urged the current team to do so too.""I mean, we did not have better facilities 30-40 years ago. Viv Richards didn’t bat on any better practice pitches or anything. We had to do the same thing, the same grind, but the passion was different. The passion to play for the West Indies was different. So I urge the young players to realise that this is a wonderful opportunity. And I am almost sure that every single one of their parents would have had in the back of their mind (that) their son (is) playing for the West Indies. Their son is doing well for the West Indies because it meant a lot back in those days. So I agree with him, but I still believe there is an onus on each young player to create that love and desire to play for the West Indies,"" he said.Asserting that Cricket West Indies needed to find a way to not lose players to franchise cricket, Lara said, ""We discussed the state of West Indies cricket. The aberration of scoring 27, nobody wants to do that. But, the issue lies very deep. And it's something that Cricket West Indies is working on in terms of finding a better footing in terms of the foundation of the game, how we grow the game, the facilities that we have to improve on and finding a way for cricketers to be a lot more competitive. There's also an issue, of course, with franchise cricket and the way they pull some of the players away, weakening our strength. So again, we have to work on that. Australia is able to do it. England is able to do it to keep their players loyal to their country. So we have to find a way to do that in terms of not pointing any fingers at anybody. It's just that we've got to come together as a team, as administrators, as coaches, as players. And well and truly if you have West Indies cricket at heart, you will find a way to move forward.”Meanwhile, showering praise on India's young explosive opener Abhishek Sharma, with whom he worked at Sunrisers Hyderabad when he was the head coach at the franchise, Lara said, ""Well, I know Abhishek from SRH. I was there during the COVID times, maybe three or four years ago. He's an amazing young player. He's something very special. I think Yuvraj Singh had a big influence on him. His bat speed, the way he hits the ball, the way he hits through the ball. .and what's an amazing thing, you know, he would give me a call and even though with the success that he's having in T20 cricket, he still wants to find a way to get into the Test team, which is great for someone like that, to think that big is very special. It's someone who I've grown very fond of, his cricket. And it's great to see that he's sort of improved and gone to a different level.""",West Indies lost the first Test by an innings and 140 runs in Ahmedabad. Brian Lara says lack of finances is the main issue facing West Indies cricket. The 'Prince of Trinidad' also points out that the West Indies players needed to play with more passion when they wore the West Caribbean shirt and cap.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124366638,imgsize-91126,width-400,resizemode-4/1280720-photos-2025-10-07t203131022.jpg"

Poll Is Varun Chakravarthy's role as a strike bowler beneficial for Team India? Yes, absolutely No, he should focus on other roles It depends on the match situation

Having played under Gautam Gambhir at the Kolkata Knight Riders and later Team India , mystery spinner Varun Chakravarthy has a fair idea of the working style of the Team India head coach, who was chiefly responsible for bringing the Tamil Nadu tweaker back into the international fold last year. The 34-year-old spinner feels that Gambhir brings a ""Spartan mentality"" to the team, ""where there's no option of losing or showing mediocrity on the field.""""I have already worked with him in the IPL and we won that IPL, so nothing new to me because I have already been around him. But definitely one thing I can say about him is he brings a Spartan mentality to the team where there is no option of losing. You just have to bring your best and give everything on the ground, and later on, whatever happens, happens. But when he is around, there is no mediocrity; you can't be mediocre in the field, that's what I feel,"" Varun said on the sidelines of the CEAT Cricket Rating Awards in Mumbai on Tuesday.A few of India's T20 specialists, including Sanju Samson and Abhishek Sharma, have already spoken about the tremendous faith the coach-captain duo of Gambhir and Suryakumar Yadav have placed in them, and how it has helped them prosper. Varun too has been a beneficiary of the duo's strategy to trust players they believe can win matches for India.Acknowledging that support, the tweaker said, ""Of course, when I made my comeback again, Surya and GG spoke to me and told me that we are looking at you as one of the wicket-takers for the Indian team. And they have backed me throughout. For that, I have to give them the credit. ""Since staging his international comeback last year, Varun has been on a wicket-taking spree, starring in India's triumphs in the ICC Champions Trophy in Feb-March (nine wickets @15.11 in three matches) and Asia Cup (seven wickets in six matches @20.42), both in the UAE. Varun said he was clear about his role: be the strike bowler and take wickets.""My role is to take wickets, keep attacking the stumps, and nothing else. Take up the tougher jobs, like bowling in the powerplay, one over in the death, and two overs in the middle. That's the role they have given me, and I'm happy to do that,"" he said.Decoding what made him so lethal in the UAE during both white-ball tournaments this year, Varun explained, ""If you see the pitches in Dubai, they worked for me; they are a little on the slower side, which helps me. Other than that, my role was to keep attacking the stumps and challenge the batsmen to take an aggressive shot so I could take a wicket. That was the basic plan.""For someone who can bowl off-spin, leg-breaks, and occasionally a straighter delivery, does this validate his description as a mystery bowler? Varun said it was a moniker given by the media, and one he didn’t mind. ""I have never called myself a mystery bowler. It's the media that has termed me as such. But if you want to call me a mystery, it's fine. I have the ability to bowl all deliveries with the same grip and release point, which makes it tough for batsmen to pick me,"" he said with a grin.Varun's approach in the death overs is simple: don't bowl to a batsman’s strengths. ""Basically, in the death overs, I look at the batsman, his strengths, and go away from them. That’s the fundamental principle,"" he revealed.Varun's spin partnership with Chinaman bowler Kuldeep Yadav , who finished as the highest wicket-taker in the T20 tournament with 17 scalps @9.29, worked wonders for India, as both bowlers complemented each other beautifully.""Kuldeep is one of the most experienced bowlers we have, and he has done amazingly well. We complement each other because I bowl around 95 km/h and he bowls around 85 km/h. He generates more turn; I generate more speed and bounce. So far, it’s been working well, and hopefully, we can continue this in the World Cup,"" Varun said.He said Team India remained confident even after Pakistan's fine start in the Asia Cup final. ""If you saw the trend, teams got off to a flyer in the first eight overs. After that, it became tough to score. Even if we got a couple of wickets, we could pull things back, and that’s what happened,"" he said.The spinner added that India’s T20 team was increasingly focused on specialists. ""In T20Is, India went with more specialist bowlers and batters than other teams. All-format players may not have the same space in T20 cricket. Most specialist players are doing that now,"" he said.","Varun Chakravarthy says Gautam Gambhir brings a ""Spartan mentality"" to the team. The 34-year-old has been a beneficiary of the duo's strategy to trust players they believe can win matches for India. Varun said he was clear about his role: be the strike bowler and take wickets.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124366854,imgsize-161160,width-400,resizemode-4/india-v-pakistan-asia-cup-final.jpg"

The Spanish soccer federation said it made the decision after receiving the results of medical tests conducted by Man City.Spain is already missing young Barcelona forward Lamine Yamal because of a groin ailment.Rodri was forced off with a suspected hamstring problem in the first half of Man City's 1-0 win at Brentford on Sunday, the latest injury blow to hit last year's Ballon d'Or winner.Rodri said after the game he ""felt a little bit in the hamstring but it seems like it's not that much.""""I stretched the leg a little bit, a bit like in the Euros final.

MADRID: Vinicius Junior fired Real Madrid to the top of La Liga with a brace in a 3-1 win over Villarreal on Saturday, while Kylian Mbappe was also on target.Los Blancos moved two points clear of champions Barcelona, who visit Sevilla on Sunday, as they bounced back from last week's derby drubbing.Having returned from their long midweek trip to Kazakhstan, where they beat Kairat in the Champions League , Madrid turned their focus back to domestic matters.Thrashed 5-2 by city rivals Atletico Madrid last weekend, Xabi Alonso's side had plenty to prove against a strong Villarreal team, who are third.""I played very well and I want to continue like this, keeping this confidence and doing even more,"" Vinicius told Real Madrid TV.""We have good feelings... when we come back (from the international break) we have big games and we need confidence,"" added Vinicius.The winger did not start the season well but has found form in recent outings.""Vini had a very good game and he was decisive, I'm very happy for him,"" Alonso told reporters.Alonso brought Fede Valverde back into the team, playing him at right-back in the absence of injured duo Dani Carvajal and Trent Alexander-Arnold.Madrid had the better of a slow-paced first half at the Santiago Bernabeu.Teenage attacker Franco Mastantuono might have sent Los Blancos ahead but Villarreal defender Renato Veiga blocked his shot after Mbappe cut the ball back to him.At the other end, Thibaut Courtois saved superbly from Tani Oluwaseyi, who snuck in behind the centre-backs but could not beat Madrid's Belgian goalkeeper.Los Blancos took the lead early in the second half through Vinicius, whose shot took a fortunate deflection off Santi Comesana and flew past the helpless Arnau Tenas.Xabi Alonso brought on Jude Bellingham for the final 25 minutes, after benching him for the second game running following the Atletico debacle.Thomas Tuchel left the midfielder out of his England squad for upcoming World Cup qualifiers this week, and he was out to prove a point.Madrid doubled their lead when Rafa Marin brought down Vinicius in the area and the Brazilian beat Tenas from the spot. The former Barcelona goalkeeper could have stopped the penalty but the ball slipped under him.Alonso said that Mbappe is Madrid's main penalty taker but ""it was their decision"" to give Vinicius the ball.Vinicius wanted another penalty when Tenas appeared to bring him down in the box moments later, but his appeals were waved away.Bellingham twice came close but Tenas denied him on both occasions, with the midfielder kicking a post in frustration.Villarreal pulled a goal back through Georges Mikautadze, who finished lethally from the edge of the box, but Madrid quickly restored their two-goal cushion.Yellow Submarine defender Santiago Mourino was sent off for a second yellow card for a push on Vinicius as he charged down the wing, and soon Mbappe netted the third.Brahim Diaz teed up the French superstar to roll home his ninth league goal of the campaign, making him the division's top scorer.Mbappe was taken off grimacing in the final stages, in the only negative note for a Madrid side who were good value for their three points.""Kylian already had a little discomfort in his ankle, we will see how it goes,"" said Alonso, adding that the forward would still travel to join up with the French national team.Villarreal's Comesana complained about some of the refereeing decisions that went against his side.""It's a shame about the first goal which hit me, and then came the penalty, which wasn't enough (of a foul) to give it,"" Comesana told DAZN.""That hurt us a lot, you only have to look how he threw himself down... and the red card (was soft)... if it's already hard to win at the Bernabeu, with these things it's even harder.""","Real Madrid beat Villarreal 3-1 at the Santiago Bernabeu. Vinicius Junior scores a brace and Kylian Mbappe also on target. Los Blancos move two points clear of Barcelona, who visit Sevilla on Sunday.

Poll Was Manchester United's win over Sunderland a turning point for their season? Yes, they'll improve No, still skeptical

Arsenal moved to the top of the Premier League table as Declan Rice came back to haunt his former club West Ham, while Manchester United gave manager Ruben Amorim some breathing space with a convincing 2-0 victory over Sunderland on Saturday.In Mikel Arteta ’s 300th match in charge, the Gunners proved too strong for West Ham at the Emirates Stadium, securing a 2-0 win that strengthened their bid for a first Premier League title in 22 years. Victory, however, came at a cost as captain Martin Odegaard was forced off injured before half-time for the third time this season. Arsenal’s squad depth, though, made light of the setback.“We dominated and fully deserved to win this,” Arteta said. “To go top of the table after some big fixtures over the last week and some injuries… we were able to respond.”Rice, who left West Ham in 2023 for a club-record £105 million ($141 million), ended the visitors’ resistance by blasting home on the rebound after Alphonse Areola parried Eberechi Eze’s shot. Bukayo Saka made the points safe from the penalty spot midway through the second half, marking his 200th Arsenal appearance after Jurrien Timber was brought down by El Hadji Malick Diouf.Arsenal now sit a point clear of Liverpool, who face Chelsea later. West Ham remain in the relegation zone.Meanwhile, Ruben Amorim breathed a sigh of relief as Manchester United eased pressure with a 2-0 win over Sunderland at Old Trafford. Mason Mount opened the scoring after eight minutes from Bryan Mbeumo’s cross, while Benjamin Sesko doubled the lead with a predatory finish from a long throw-in. Debutant goalkeeper Senne Lammens kept a clean sheet, and VAR overturned a late Sunderland penalty after insufficient contact by Sesko.Amorim said, “We were a competitive and adult team today. We need to do this kind of performance away as well — it’s our responsibility to play like this.”Tottenham also impressed with a 2-1 win over Leeds, ending their year-long unbeaten league run. Mohammed Kudus scored his first goal for Spurs after Mathys Tel had put the visitors ahead, with Noah Okafor briefly equalising.Liverpool can reclaim the top spot if they beat Chelsea later.",Arsenal beat West Ham 2-0 in Mikel Arteta's 300th match in charge.

Poll Do you agree with Tuchel's decision to leave Bellingham out of the squad for upcoming matches? Yes, it’s the right choice. No, he should be included.

England manager Thomas Tuchel has explained that Jude Bellingham’s absence from the squad for upcoming matches against Wales and Latvia is due to the midfielder’s “lack of rhythm” and not any personal issues.Bellingham, 22, missed England’s September victories over Andorra and Serbia following shoulder surgery and has since featured in only four matches for Real Madrid, starting just once.“He’s a very special player and for special players there can be special rules, I get this,” Tuchel said, referring to Bellingham, who was named England men’s player of the year for 2024/25 at the start of the month. “But for this camp we decided that we stick with our straightforward decision to invite the same team. That applies also for Jude, he deserves always to be in camp.”Tuchel added that Bellingham had been eager to play. “He wanted to be called up, we had a phone call, there was no issue from that side,” he said.The manager also addressed concerns about any friction with other notable absentees, Jack Grealish and Phil Foden, stressing: “No, there is also no problem between me and Phil Foden, there is also no problem with Jack Grealish.Very special players. There is no problem at all, there is no personal problem.”Arsenal forward Bukayo Saka returns to the squad after missing September’s internationals with a hamstring issue, while Cole Palmer, Noni Madueke, and Tino Livramento are ruled out through injury.England currently sit atop their World Cup qualifying group, having beaten Andorra 2-0 and Serbia 5-0 last month to record five wins from five matches. Tuchel emphasised the decision to maintain continuity in the squad, saying, “We decided to invite the same group of players to make more stable what we built on.

What’s common between the three Formula E world champions

How the three World Champions fared in Formula E Season 11

Days after Oliver Rowland lifted his Formula E World Championship trophy in London this season, an interesting trend has come to the attention of Formula E and its fans. As a coincidence, all Formula E drivers who won the Mexico City E-Prix went on to win the Formula E World Championship that season, and this has been proved right for three consecutive years.Highlighting the same since 2023, a poster of three World Champions was shared on X by Formula E with the caption, “The trend continues. Each winner of the #MexicoCityEPrix from the past three seasons has gone on to become World Champion.”The special poster features 2023 Formula E World Champion Jake Dennis from Andretti, then TAG Heuer Porsche’s Pascal Wehrlein, who won in 2024, and the new World Champion, Nissan driver Oliver Rowland.

Taylor Barnard on losing top three spot in Formula E World Championship

Fans hail Taylor Barnard for his fantastic rookie season

It was Taylor Barnard’s rookie season this year, and the NEOM McLaren driver put up a fantastic performance by temporarily making it to the top three in the Formula E Driver Standings by ousting the much more experienced Porsche driver Antonio Felix Da Costa. He was, however, ousted from the top three at the London E-Prix as Jaguar’s Nick Cassidy went on to register three consecutive wins. Barnard took to Instagram to share his feelings on losing out on the top three in his first-ever season and his claim to the championship.Taking to Instagram after the London E-Prix, Barnard wrote, “London wasn’t what we hoped for, easily being the toughest weekend of our season. Taking 0 points away as a team from a doubleheader hurts, but one weekend doesn’t define the year we’ve had.”He further wrote, “As the season closes, I want to say a massive thank you to the entire team, both trackside and behind the scenes, for everything this season. Finishing P4 in the Drivers’ Championship and coming into the final weekend with a shot at runner-up is something to be proud of.”Also adding a note for teammate Sam Bird, as NEOM McLaren withdrew from Formula E after the end of the season, Barnard wrote, “@sambird_official it wasn’t the weekend you deserved either.You’ve been a huge part of my season both on and off the track, and I’m grateful for everything. You deserved more. To all the Papaya fans, thank you for the incredible support in our final race together. You always go above and beyond. ”Reacting to his post, a fan wrote, “An incredible debut season, huge congrats and excited to see where you go next!” Another said, “I know I said it the other day, but you’ve been incredible to watch this last year and a pleasure to support you in Papaya — there are many of us that can’t wait to support you in whatever you do next!” One more commented, “You were incredible all season around, Taylor. Massive congratulations. You are the future of this sport.”Recalling Barnard’s maiden pole, a fan also wrote, “Fantastic season, Taylor, we'll never forget that Monaco pole.”Also Read: Taylor Barnard looks back at rookie season at McLaren: “Every step has been unforgettable” Barnard claimed five podiums in his first full season in Formula E.

We couldn’t have done it without you all — your trust and support have never been taken for granted,” he added.Praising the two McLaren drivers, he wrote, “Sam clinched McLaren’s first-ever fully electric win at the São Paulo E-Prix in Season 10, pulling off one of Formula E’s all-time great overtakes, before being waved across the line by none other than Emerson Fittipaldi – McLaren's first Formula 1 World Champion.

Gautam Gambhir hits out at critics after India beat Australia to reach Champions Trophy final

Virat Kohli steers India to third consecutive Champions Trophy final

NEW DELHI: The outcome of Sunday’s ICC Champions Trophy final is likely to form the base for Indian cricket’s preparation for the ODI World Cup in 2027 and the next World Test Championship (WTC) cycle.It could determine the future course for captain Rohit Sharma with the Indian cricket board (BCCI) keen on having a stable leadership while planning the coming two years.According to sources, there could be a tough discussion over moving on from Rohit at least as captain in ODIs and Tests. The board has also held back announcing the fresh central contracts and will wait for the final against New Zealand. TOI understands chief selector Ajit Agarkar and head coach Gautam Gambhir have already discussed the proposition with the board and Rohit after returning from the Australia tour. It is also learnt that during the meeting, the Indian captain was not averse to the idea of setting a roadmap for the team once the Champions Trophy ends.“Rohit still believes there is some cricket left in him. He has been told to communicate his plans going forward. Retiring is his call but there will be another discussion around continuing with captaincy. Rohit himself understands the need to have a stable captain if the team wants to prepare for a World Cup. There have been talks with Kohli too but there doesn’t seem to be much anxiety around him,” a BCCI source told TOI.BCCI usually announces its annual player retainership before the IPL. The board wanted to see how the team fared in the Champions Trophy after a disastrous Test season.It is learnt that the board wanted to revisit the Grade A+ contracts. Currently, Rohit, Kohli, Jasprit Bumrah and Ravindra Jadeja make up the top grade.With BCCI’s policy suggesting that players performing in all three formats are preferred for A+ contracts, there were some concerns with Rohit, Kohli and Jadeja retiring from T20Is and also enduring a very rough Test season. However, a strong showing in the Champions Trophy could help these players retain the marquee contract.It will be interesting to see if Axar Patel, KL Rahul and Rishabh Pant are promoted to A category. Shreyas Iyer is likely to win back his central contract after he was removed last year due to disciplinary issues. Kohli has sort of strengthened his case with a superlative show in the Champions Trophy so far.“The board will wait for Rohit’s decision after the Champions Trophy. If by any chance he chooses to retire, then the board will see what needs to be done. One can’t discount the fact that he won the T20 World Cup in July and has led well in the Champions Trophy as well,” the source said.Interestingly, MS Dhoni had quit white-ball captaincy two years before the 2019 World Cup which gave Kohli time to ease into the role.Kohli too stepped down as white-ball captain in 2021, leaving Rohit two years to run the team before the 2023 ODI World Cup.Factoring in that current ODI vice-captain Shubman Gill is still raw as a captain and Jasprit Bumrah’s persisting fitness issues, the selectors will need more time if they have to move on from Rohit.",The outcome of Sunday's ICC Champions Trophy final is likely to form the base for Indian cricket’s preparation for the ODI World Cup in 2027 and the next World Test Championship (WTC) cycle.

New Zealand will look to play their cards more smartly in the match that matters, the Champions trophy final against India on Sunday, having experienced the spin-heavy strategy employed by Rohit Sharma & Co during their group-stage encounter. However, there's more than one thing about the Kiwis that India too must be wary of.Former India batter Ambati Rayudu gave a lowdown on the players that may trouble India in the title clash.Speaking about the big game in a Star Sports video, Rayudu said: ""We have to be very, very wary of three players.""New Zealand's bowling attack has revolved around the left-arm spin of captain Mitchell Santner, more so in Dubai than at the three batting-friendly venues in Pakistan. He showed that during his crafty spell in the semi-final against South Africa in Lahore, where he choked the Proteas with his 3 for 43 in the middle overs of their chase.While Santner's seven wickets in four matches may not appear a menacing stat, it's his economy rate of 4.85 runs that resembles the kind of web Indian spinners have tangled the opposition batters into. He will be even more important if tournament's top wicket-taker, fast bowler Matt Henry, doesn't recover from his shoulder injury to play the final.With two centuries in three matches, top-order batter Rachin Ravindra remains the biggest threat for the Indian bowlers. His 226 runs in three matches at an average of 75.33 has propped up the Kiwi batting line-up.The challenge for him will be to navigate through the quartet of Indian spinners in Dubai, especially considering his failure in the group-stage match against the Indian team, scoring just six runs before being dismissed by Hardik Pandya.Interestingly, Rayudu predicted Conway's return to the playing eleven in the final and warned India to not overlook the left-handed batter's attacking skills.He played New Zealand's first two matches of this Champions Trophy against Pakistan and Bangladesh, scoring 10 and 30 respectively. The opener has remained out of the playing eleven since then, with the Kiwis opting to open with Will Young and Ravindra in the subsequent group match against India and the semifinal against South Africa.",New Zealand take on India in the Champions Trophy final on Sunday. Ambati Rayudu says the Kiwis must be wary of three players.

Virat Kohli steers India to third consecutive Champions Trophy final

Gautam Gambhir hits out at critics after India beat Australia to reach Champions Trophy final

In a team where most of India’s top guns are firing away, he has quietly delivered the goods. In a campaign where all talk has revolved around India’s spinners, the superlative comebacks of Mohammed Shami from injury and Virat Kohli from poor form, the sizzling batting of Shubman Gill, skipper Rohit Sharma, Shreyas Iyer and KL Rahul, what a consistent Hardik Pandya has brought to the team has found little or no word in edgewise.Hardly surprising, but not anymore. In Tuesday’s semifinal against Australia, walking in with India delicately placed at 225/5, having just lost the Virat Kohli for 84, Pandya turned the 265-run chase into a walk in the park.He unleashed three big sixes, beginning with a 106-m monster hit off Tanveer Sangha followed by back-to-back sixes off Adam Zampa. He eventually holed out to pacer Nathan Ellis, but the 31-year-old’s entertaining 24-ball 28 had done the job – swinging it decisively India’s way. Earlier, opening the bowling with Shami, Pandya ran into a belligerent Travis Head, but did well to hold his own. All he allowed Head was one run in his first over, before the attacking left-hander took his chances.“I thought his contributions against Pakistan and New Zealand were crucial too. He struck some lusty blows and made a few important breakthroughs,” ex-chairman of selector Kiran More told TOI from Baroda — the cricketing centre where the former India wicketkeeper trained the Pandya brothers, Hardik and Krunal at his academy.Against Pakistan, Pandya accounted for Babar Azam and a well-set Saud Shakeel while conceding just 31 off eight, and New Zealand saw him score a quickfire 45 off 45 balls, and then watched as he claimed the dangerous Rachin Ravindra while giving away 22 in four overs. Indeed, it is the sight of Pandya walking in at No. 7 that makes India such a formidable force here.For those from a generation back, it’s just the kind of strength that Australia would boast of in Tests in the early 2000s, when the legendary ’keeper-bat Adam Gilchrist would come in at that slot and destroy tiring bowling attacks.Against New Zealand in the final on Sunday night in Dubai, expect Pandya to again hold the key, both with ball and bat. It forces the mind back to the 2023 ODI World Cup, when he was ruled out after an ankle injury midway through the tournament. Would Pandya’s presence then have helped India get past eventual champions Australia in that final at Ahmedabad? Of course, the answer remains in the realm of imagination — that eternal ‘what if’ — but he certainly would have made a big difference.It is the presence of a player of his versatility, someone who can open the bowling as a reliable seamer and bat effectively at No. 7, that is allowing India the luxury of playing four spinners in Dubai.Bouncing back after a poor IPL last season, where he was skipper in Mumbai Indians’ poorest outing – finishing last after losing 10 matches and winning a mere four – and living through the ignominy of being booed by the Wankhede Stadium crowd, he played a stellar role in India’s T20 World Cup triumph in the West Indies and the US in June 2024. He took 11 wickets at 17.36, and chipping in with 144 runs with a strike rate of 151.57.Apparently being formed for white-ball captaincy, having led India’s T20 team since Jan 2023, Pandya was suddenly replaced by Suryakumar Yadav as T20 captain, and Shubman Gill overtook him as the ODI vice-captain. A demotion of this nature could have shaken up anyone, but Pandya simply sported his trademark shrug and shook off the setback. Today, he looks as happy as ever in the India dugout, amply evident with the way he hugged Virat Kohli and his other India teammates after India made the final.“He’s a lion-hearted cricketer. For the last six-seven months, it’s evident that he’s just enjoying his cricket. He is not someone who will hold grudges against anyone. Maaf karta hai aur chal deta hai (he forgives, forgets and moves on),” More said.","Hardik Pandya has quietly delivered the goods for India.

King Kohli's masterclass puts India in final | IND vs AUS | ICC Champions Trophy 2025

Gautam Gambhir hits out at critics after India beat Australia to reach Champions Trophy final

: Karachi to Rawalpindi to Dubai to Lahore to back in Dubai. Last few weeks have seen New Zealand play their four Champions Trophy fixtures at four different venues and they have only lost one game - to India in Dubai. Three days after losing the game, the Black Caps have landed in Dubai again to prepare for the title clash of the multi-nation tournament on March 9 The two top sides in the tournament have had a contrasting journey to the final as New Zealand acclimitised to different conditions for all their games and India were parked in Dubai since February 15, and played all their fixtures at the Dubai International Stadium.Even in their only defeat, the Mitchell Santner-led unit posed a stiff challenge for India but fell short of the target by 44 runs. Unbeaten India have managed to tick most of the boxes in their outings but they will have to be wary of the Kiwis who are the most prepared team in the competition , and will definitely have a score to settle on Sunday. They have encountered different challenges at different venues and have come out on top in spite of the non-stop travel, and have excelled in the art of adapting to different conditions.They did put India under the pump early in the group stage contest but a solid repair job and late flourish meant there were just enough runs for the spin quartet of Ravindra Jadeja, Kuldeep Yadav, Axar Patel and Varun Chakravarthy to defend. Varun, who picked a fifer on his maiden outing in the tournament, tormented the opposition batters but they did put up a fight and had Kane Williamson, 81, got some support from the other end, it could have been a much closer contest.On paper, very little separates the two teams as they have a very similar make-up of the Playing XI and there is no dearth of experience in both camps. If India have the potent spin quartet, Santner has Rachin Ravindra, Michael Bracewell and even Glenn Phillips to play the support cast. And as far as quicks are concerned, New Zealand definitely hold the edge as spin-heavy approach means India are reliant on Mohammed Shami to do the heavy lifting and only has Hardik Pandya to do the support job.More than the similar makeup and ability to seamlessly adapt, what would make India wary of New Zealand is the fact that they will for the first time play an opposition which has had a recent taste of Dubai conditions. The conditions which have been on the sluggish side and favoured spin. Yes, the seamers - Shami and Matt Henry - have enjoyed success but the slower bowlers have had a bigger impact on the match.New Zealand have embraced the challenges without any complaints and have set-up a mouth-watering repeat of the 2000 edition of the Champions Trophy. Senior batter Kane Williamson said the team will take learnings from their last meeting into the final, and reiterated that anything can happen in the final.""India are an outstanding team and is playing really well. So, look, it's important we try and take away some learnings from that last game. Park this match, and in a final, anything can happen. And it was a great atmosphere last game and I'm sure it'll be a good one again,"" said Williamson after the win over South Africa in the semis.On the expected lines, Williamson was asked a familiar question on the advantage India have of playing at the same venue. The experienced campaigner responded with the straight bat and chose to focus on the cricket they wish to play in the title clash.""I suppose having played there on a number of occasions; there's real clarity in how they want to operate. A little bit like our opportunity here, having played a number of times at this venue as well and I think that's part and parcel in cricket. So, it's just not something we're really looking too closely at. It's about the cricket that we want to play and take into account, obviously, the opposition, but be nice and smart come that final,"" added Williamson.New Zealand have few more days to do what they have seamlessly managed in the tournament so far - acclimitise and take the challenge head on.","New Zealand face India in the Champions Trophy final on March 9. The Black Caps lost to India by 44 runs in the semi-final in Dubai. Kane Williamson said the team will take learnings from their last meeting into the final, and reiterated that anything can happen in the final.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118766013,imgsize-76718,width-400,resizemode-4/118766013.jpg"

New Zealand captain Mitchell Santner has discussed their preparation for the Champions Trophy final against India at the DICS in Dubai on March 9.The New Zealand team landed in Dubai on Thursday evening for the ICC showpiece's title clash.""They've played all their games here in Dubai and know that surface.

It might be more of a scrap, but we're down to scrap,"" Santner said upon arrival.New Zealand can draw confidence from their previous encounter with India during the group stage matches.India had secured a 44-run victory over New Zealand in their Group A match, though the result had no impact on tournament standings.""We've come against a good side. I think we'll be better for the run we had the other day against them. We've had a bit of a roll on. Hopefully, it continues,"" he stated.The New Zealand team has been traveling between Pakistan and Dubai for their recent matches, including their final group game, semifinal, and the upcoming final.The left-arm spinner spoke about the team's adaptation to their busy schedule.""It's just the general feel of this tournament, moving around a lot. It's all part of the challenge. I think we've been to every place here. Obviously, in Pakistan and Dubai. I think the guys understand it's part of it these days.

FIFA declared on Wednesday that participants in this year's Club World Cup in the United States will receive combined prize money of one billion dollars.""The FIFA Club World Cup will not only be the pinnacle of club football , but also a vivid demonstration of solidarity that will benefit clubs at large to a scale that no other competition has ever done,"" said FIFA president Gianni Infantino.""All revenue generated by the tournament will be distributed to the participating clubs and via club solidarity across the world as FIFA will not keep a single dollar.""This sum substantially exceeds the prize money allocated for both recent men's and women's World Cup tournaments.The global football authority has provided limited information regarding the financing of this inaugural 32-team competition, scheduled to occur quadrennially, though it has recently secured agreements with a broadcaster and major sponsors.FIFA's statement confirming the prize money allocation indicated an anticipated revenue of $2 billion from the expanded Club World Cup. Additionally, they confirmed the introduction of a women's edition beginning in 2028.DAZN, the British streaming platform, secured worldwide exclusive rights to the tournament scheduled for June 14-July 13, with insider sources indicating the deal value approximated one billion euros ($1.05 billion).FIFA has established additional sponsorship agreements with several major corporations, including Coca-Cola, Bank of America, Chinese electronics manufacturer Hisense, and AB InBev, the Belgian brewing company.For reference, the 2022 men's World Cup in Qatar distributed $440 million in prize money, whilst the 2023 Women's World Cup in New Zealand and Australia offered $110 million.The UEFA Champions League's revised 36-team structure for this season will distribute total payments of 2.47 billion euros ($2.66 billion) amongst participating clubs.","FIFA announces $1.05 billion prize money for Club World Cup.

South Africa were beaten by 50 runs in the semi-finals of the Champions Trophy by New Zealand in Lahore on Wednesday. In the process, Proteas' dismal record in knockout stages of big-ticket ODI tournaments continued.They have now lost five Champions Trophy semi-finals — 2000, 2002, 2006, 2013 and 2025. The Proteas also lost in the semi-finals of the 1992, 2007, 2015 and 2023 ODI World Cups. Additionally, they tied the semi-final of the 1999 ODI World Cup in dramatic fashion.If that wasn't enough, South Africa were stopped short on the finish line by India in the final of last year's T20 World Cup.Chasing a target of 214 to defeat Australia at Edgbaston, South Africa felt victory was within reach, thanks to Lance Klusener’s explosive form. With only one run needed and four balls remaining, the dynamic left-hander pushed his team close to triumph.However, disaster struck on the fourth delivery when Klusener and the last man, Allan Donald, miscommunicated, leaving Donald stranded at the non-striker's end. In a frantic attempt to make it to the other end, Donald was run out by Adam Gilchrist, and the scores were tied.The dramatic dismissal sparked wild celebrations among the Australian players, as the tie secured their qualification for the final due to their earlier victory over South Africa in the group stage.In a thrilling moment during the 2015 World Cup in Auckland, New Zealand's Grant Elliott managed to score 12 runs off Dale Steyn’s final over, eliminating South Africa from the tournament.Elliott had led a spirited comeback in response to a rain-adjusted target of 298. With just five runs needed from the last two balls, he hit a six off Steyn to clinch the victory by four wickets, following the DLS method.Steyn collapsed in despair, while Elliott joyfully celebrated his unbeaten 84 runs off 73 balls.After a dazzling tournament, South Africa appeared poised to contend for the title, highlighted by a commanding 134-run victory over Australia. However, they met their match again in the semi-finals against the same opponent.Playing under overcast skies in Kolkata, South Africa struggled to 212 all out, despite a valiant century from David Miller. While they put up a valiant fight, Australia ultimately prevailed by three wickets, dashing South Africa’s hopes of another title.","South Africa were beaten by 50 runs in the semi-finals of the Champions Trophy by New Zealand in Lahore on Wednesday.

New Zealand set up a title clash with India in the Champions Trophy , after they defeated South Africa by 50 runs in the second semifinal on Wednesday in Lahore . India had beaten Australia by four wickets in the first semifinal in Dubai .The BlackCaps' win set up a final that will be a repeat of the group-stage clash between the two sides, and Kiwi captain Mitchell Santner said he is looking forward to it.""Being there in Dubai and putting India under pressure gave us confidence. You take in what things work and what doesn't,"" said Santner after New Zealand's semifinal victory.

The finishers did their job,"" said the NZ captain.""It's a cool feeling to make the final. We were challenged by a good side. We've had a go against India, look forward to do it again.""""The key for the bowlers (while defending was) to keep chipping away with wickets. It was good personally. What we speak about as a group is to apply pressure, but still take wickets. It was pleasing to get three pretty good scalps personally,"" said Santner who returned with figures of 3 for 43.Santner praised veteran batter and former skipper Williamson for continuing to deliver the goods over the years when the team needs it the most, while praising his 164-run stand with Ravindra.""Williamson keeps doing it.

Virat Kohli steers India to third consecutive Champions Trophy final

South Africa's David Miller expressed concerns about his team's brief trip to Dubai before their Champions Trophy semi-final loss to New Zealand in Lahore.The tournament's complex scheduling required both Australia and South Africa to fly to Dubai from Pakistan prior to the semi-finals. South Africa's stay lasted less than 24 hours before returning without playing any matches.Australia remained in Dubai and subsequently lost to India in their semi-final match. The scheduling complications arose because India played all their matches in Dubai, refusing to travel to tournament hosts Pakistan due to political and safety reasons.""It's only an hour and 40 minute flight, but the fact that we had to do that was not ideal,"" Miller said after South Africa's 50-run defeat to New Zealand on Wednesday.South Africa made this trip shortly after defeating England in Karachi on Saturday.""It's early morning, it's after a game and we had to fly. Then we got to Dubai at 4:00 pm. And at 7.30 am we had to come back. It doesn't make it nice. It's not like we flew five hours, and we had enough time to recover and recuperate, but it was not an ideal situation still.""Miller scored an unbeaten century off 67 balls, but it wasn't enough to prevent South Africa's loss to New Zealand, who will now face India in Sunday's final in Dubai.New Zealand set a Champions Trophy record by posting 362-6, powered by impressive centuries from Rachin Ravindra and Kane Williamson.Temba Bavuma and Rassie van der Dussen contributed 56 and 69 runs respectively, forming a crucial 105-run partnership for the second wicket.

""I think the wicket just deteriorated as the game went on and they spun the ball a lot more than us.

Excerpts…

How do you look back at the long journey?

What was the best moment of your career?

Any regrets?

How did you deal with the tough periods?

What’s the secret of your longevity?

CHENNAI: Indian table tennis legend A Sharath Kamal will call time on a lengthy and illustrious career later this month. Also to go will be that iconic bandana, a permanent fixture in Indian sports over the past couple of decades.“This is certainly the end for us on the big tables, in front of the big crowds. Time to give my bandana and racket some rest,” the legend said here on Wednesday.On top of his game for more than 22 years, and having resisted the temptation of lasting another Olympic cycle, Sharath, at 42, could be forgiven for feeling a bit nostalgic.“I played my first international tournament — Asian Juniors — in my hometown and I will be playing my last international tournament also in Chennai,” he said.The WTT Star Contender event here, later this month, will be his final outing. Sharath won several accolades at the national and international levels. The Padma Shri and Khel Ratna awardee secured multiple gold medals at the Commonwealth Games , made significant contributions at the Asian Games and represented India in as many as five Olympic Games.His greatest contribution, perhaps, is to have helped make table tennis and himself a household name in India. On Wednesday, amid all the emotion of his announcement, Sharath took TOI along for a trip down memory lane.It’s gratifying. More than for myself, for the people around me, my parents, coaches and family. I think they’re proud of what I have done for myself. I wish it never ended, but all good things must come to an end.It’s very tough to say just one, but personally, I had two really good outings. One was the Tokyo Olympics, when I played against Ma Long, the Olympic champion back then. That was one of the finest matches that I ever played (despite losing 1-4).The biggest thing that changed the face of Indian table tennis were the Asian Games medals in 2018. For the first time in 60 years, India won a table tennis medal at the Asian Games.I wish there was more money and support back in my early days. But I’m really happy that the sport has come such a long way. From being an extracurricular activity, it’s becoming much more professional. Today, people understand what it takes to be a sportsperson and what it takes to achieve anything in sport. Ten years ago, when you said that you wanted to play sport, people wondered what you were doing with your life.In 2011, from 38, I fell to 94 in the rankings. Slowly, things were shaping up again and I returned to world No. 32. Later, I had a career-threatening hamstring injury and had no clue whether I would be able to go to Rio Olympics. I had thought that my best would come in Rio, but then, mere qualification for the Olympics became tough.From 2017, the second innings of Sharath Kamal started. I did not win gold medals between 2010 and 2020, but I have a lot of bronze medals from that time, all of them complete team efforts. The number of highs in my second innings have been unbelievable. Between 2017 and 2024, we won two bronze medals at the Asiad, had a successful 2022 (which included multiple CWG medals), and I was India’s flag bearer in Paris.That I was able to adapt to changes, I guess, has proved most important. I continued to work hard and was mostly out of my comfort zone. Generally, as senior athletes, when you get into your comfort zone, you continue to remain in it, not wanting to change. Often, without changes, you are not going to move forward. I have been fortunate to have coaches who made me work in uncharted waters.",Indian table tennis legend A Sharath Kamal will call time on a lengthy and illustrious career later this month.

Gautam Gambhir hits out at critics after India beat Australia to reach Champions Trophy final

Steve Smith after Champions Trophy loss: 'India outplayed us and deserve the victory'

By entering the final of the Champions Trophy after defeating Australia in the semis on Tuesday in Dubai, India captain Rohit Sharma achieved what no other captain in the history of cricket has ever accomplished.Rohit is now the only captain to have led his team to the finals of all International Cricket Council (ICC) tournaments: ODI World Cup , T20 World Cup , Champions Trophy and World Test Championship (WTC). And he has achieved that in just three years' time.It is also India's fifth entry into a Champions Trophy final -- which extended their record as no other team has done it more than three times.In 2023, India qualified for the WTC final and the ODI World Cup final, losing to Australia on both the occasions. The next year, in 2024, India won the T20 World Cup under Rohit by beating South Africa in the final. It was India's first ICC title in 10 years and the second T20 World Cup triumph since 2007.If India go on to win this Champions Trophy, Rohit will join MS Dhoni as the two captains to have led India to victory in the tournament. India previously won the title under Dhoni's captaincy in 2013.While Rohit has given the team brisk starts in their four matches of this Champions Trophy campaign, a big knock is still awaited from the Indian skipper.So far, he has scored only 104 runs with a highest of 41 and would want to mark the tournament with a match-winning knock in the final on March 9.",Rohit Sharma is the only captain to have led his team to the finals of all International Cricket Council (ICC) tournaments.

Former Pakistan Test coach Jason Gillespie called current interim lead Aaqib Javed as a 'clown'.

Former Australian fast bowler Jason Gillespie has slammed Pakistan 's interim head coach Aaqib Javed on social media, calling him a ""clown"" for his campaign to become the team's coach across all formats.Javed had expressed concerns about Pakistan's performance being affected by frequent changes in management and team personnel across formats. The Champions Trophy hosts were eliminated from the ongoing 50-over tournament after losing to New Zealand and India, with their final match against Bangladesh being rained out.""We have changed nearly 16 coaches and 26 selectors in the last two years or so,"" Javed stated at a news conference announcing Pakistan's limited-overs squad changes. ""You put that formula on any team in the world, I think they will also be in the same situation. Until you get consistency right from the top down to the bottom, from the chairman down, then your team will not progress.""Gillespie, who played 71 tests and 97 ODIs during his ten-year international career, dismissed Javed's comments as ""hilarious.""Gillespie had been appointed as Pakistan's Test coach in April for a two-year term but resigned before a series in South Africa, just eight months into his role following an unsuccessful start.His departure came shortly after South African Gary Kirsten stepped down as limited-overs coach in October, making them the second foreign coach to leave Pakistan's program in less than two months.""Aaqib was clearly undermining Gary and I behind the scenes campaigning to be the coach in all formats,"" Gillespie posted on Instagram. ""He is a clown.""Javed was initially appointed as interim coach until the Champions Trophy. However, with the Pakistan Cricket Board yet to find a replacement, he will continue in his role for the upcoming New Zealand tour, beginning March 16.","Former Pakistan Test coach Jason Gillespie calls current interim lead Aaqib Javed as a 'clown' Javed had expressed concerns about Pakistan's performance being affected by frequent changes in management and team personnel across formats.

NEW DELHI: Amelia Kerr 's impressive fifer was followed by Hayley Matthews ' 46-ball 68 blitz as Mumbai Indians pulled off commanding six-wicket victory over UP Warriorz in the Women's Premier League in Lucknow on Thursday.As Mumbai successfully chased down the target of 151 in 18.3 overs, the win propelled them to second place with eight points, just two points behind Delhi Capitals, with one game remaining.UP Warriorz suffered their third straight loss, which has now severely impacted their chances of advancing in the tournament.Mumbai Indians' chase at Ekana Stadium began with an early setback as Amelia Kerr departed for 10 runs after registering career-best figures of 5 for 38 with the ball. However, Matthews took control, scoring a quick 35-ball fifty and forming a crucial 92-run partnership with Nat Sciver-Brunt in just 58 balls.Matthews displayed excellent batting technique, particularly on the off-side. She achieved her second half-century of the season against UP Warriorz with a well-placed boundary.She dominated Chinelle Henry with a powerful six and hit consecutive boundaries against Sophie Ecclestone, helping Mumbai reach 50 for 1 in the powerplay.Despite UP Warriorz captain Deepti Sharma's spectacular catch to dismiss Sciver-Brunt for 37 runs, Mumbai Indians needed only 35 runs from 43 balls.Matthews continued her aggressive batting against Kranti Goud, scoring a boundary and a six. Her innings of 68 runs, featuring eight fours and two sixes, ended in the same over.Yastika Bhatia's quick 10 runs off six balls, including two boundaries against Deepti Sharma, secured the victory with nine balls remaining.Earlier, Mumbai's decision to bowl first proved effective as New Zealand's Amelia Kerr became the sixth player in WPL history to claim five wickets.UP Warriorz started strongly at 74/0 in 7.5 overs, with Voll scoring her first WPL fifty in 29 balls. She particularly targeted Kerr with four consecutive boundaries.The momentum shifted as Mumbai Indians captured three wickets in quick succession. Matthews dismissed Grace Harris for 28 runs, while Kerr removed Kiran Navgire for zero.Voll's innings ended when she attempted a scoop shot but was bowled by Sciver-Brunt's slower delivery.Kerr finished strongly in the final over, claiming two more wickets including Chinelle Henry, who managed just six runs after hitting a six.UP Warriorz's batting collapsed dramatically, losing nine wickets for 76 runs in the final 12.1 overs, finishing at 150/9.","Mumbai Indians beat UP Warriorz by six wickets in Women's Premier League.

NEW DELHI: England cricket 's managing director Rob Key has kept the possibility open for Test captain Ben Stokes to lead the white-ball team.The development comes after Jos Buttler stepped down from his position following England's poor performance at the Champions Trophy tournament in Pakistan and UAE, where they lost all three group matches.England's white-ball performance has declined significantly, with the team losing 10 out of their 11 matches this year.Harry Brook, who was considered next in line for captaincy, might face challenges due to his involvement across all three cricket formats.Key is evaluating various options, including expanding Stokes's leadership role.Stokes, at 33, has shown exceptional leadership skills as Test captain since taking over from Joe Root, though he has primarily focused on Test cricket for the past 16 months due to age and injuries.If appointed as limited-overs captain, Stokes would continue working with Brendon McCullum, who now oversees both Test and white-ball teams.""I think nothing's off the table really,"" Key told reporters at Lord's. ""Ben Stokes is one of the best captains I've ever seen. It would be stupid not to look at him. It's just the knock-on effect of what that means.""Stokes hasn't participated in T20Is since the World Cup final in November 2022 and hasn't played in ODIs since the 2023 World Cup in India.England's current position in rankings shows them at seventh place in ODIs and third in T20s, despite winning the 2019 World Cup under Eoin Morgan and the 2022 T20 World Cup under Buttler.""We were very poor in the Champions Trophy,"" said Key. ""But the truth is, we haven't been particularly good in white-ball cricket, probably since the last era when (retired captain) Eoin Morgan did it.""Key defended McCullum's coaching approach, which has faced criticism for being overly aggressive.""It's not true that the only thing he (McCullum) says is go harder, go harder, go harder,"" said Key. ""He speaks all the time about soaking up pressure as well.Key also addressed concerns about players' commitment to the game.""Sometimes they're reckless, sometimes they make the wrong decision at the wrong time,"" he said. ""But that's the game, right?""But it's not a case that all we think is you go out there and play one way...You've got to be able to put bowlers under pressure, and good bowlers under pressure, and you've got to be able to soak it up and you've got to be able to make that decision at the right time.""","England cricket's managing director Rob Key keeps possibility open for Test captain Ben Stokes to lead the white-ball team.

The team's success has largely depended on Virat Kohli and international players like Chris Gayle, AB de Villiers, Faf Du Plessis, and Glenn Maxwell, unlike other IPL teams that feature local players as their brand ambassadors.Speaking on JioHotstar about RCB's management, Venkatesh said, ""How a team is managed makes all the difference. Other teams are putting faith in local talent, so why is not RCB doing the same? Are they building a brand, or are they truly focused on winning the IPL? They need to get the best out of their players, which has not happened so far.""RCB's previous season saw a remarkable turnaround when they reached the playoffs after winning only one of their first eight matches, followed by six consecutive victories.""Everyone wrote them off at the start, but I picked them to win.

Indian cricketer Rahul Tripathi has shared insights about valuable guidance he received from MS Dhoni before his Indian Premier League debut in 2017. The advice from his former captain focused on staying true to his natural playing style.Tripathi's IPL journey began in the league's tenth season with Rising Pune Super Giants, where he played alongside Dhoni. The veteran wicketkeeper-batsman helped ease Tripathi's pre-match anxiety before his first game.""Two days before I was going to play my first match, I was observing him in the dressing room. He called me and told me not to try or think about anything extra and asked me to play the way I was playing while training. Given that this advice came from a cricketer of that stature and the fact that I was going to play my debut match, it gave me a lot of confidence. It really calmed my nerves,"" Tripathi said on the House of Glory podcast.“I am blessed to have gotten the time to spend with him. It’s the dream of many people in the cricket world to share experiences with him and play alongside him. And by being with him, I have seen that he keeps it simple,” he further added.Tripathi's international cricket career began in January 2023 when he made his T20I debut against Sri Lanka at age 31. The long wait tested his resolve, but he maintained a positive outlook throughout the journey.""I never gave up. At times, it was tough, and it felt that the dream to represent India was quite far away. But I decided to keep trying and always believed that one day I would get the opportunity I was waiting for. And I feel this belief was one of the reasons why I finally received the opportunity.""""It was a very emotional moment. After travelling with the team for 6-7 hours, I was finally able to make my T20I debut. Coincidentally, I made my debut at my home ground in Pune, where I have been playing cricket since childhood. So I think it was all written.""The 34-year-old cricketer attributes much of his success to Abhishek Nayar, former India player and current Indian team batting coach.""I think the biggest and most important contribution in my journey has been made by Abhishek Nayar. I consider him my elder brother. Meeting him was the changing point of my life.""""We played together in BPCL for a year, but when I joined KKR, it was a different experience with Dinesh Karthik also being there. I really enjoyed my time there. I call him Abhi dada, and I feel it's because of his contribution that I was able to fulfill my dream to play for India.""Tripathi will represent Chennai Super Kings in the upcoming 18th edition of the IPL, which begins on March 22.","Indian cricketer Rahul Tripathi has shared insights about valuable guidance he received from MS Dhoni.

What is the timed out rule in cricket?

What happened in the incident involving Shakeel?

How many batters have been dismissed in First-Class cricket in similar manner?

Has it happened in international cricket also?

In a notable incident during the President's Trophy final in Rawalpindi, Saud Shakeel became the first Pakistan batter to be timed out in First-Class cricket.The State Bank of Pakistan 's number five batter failed to make it to the crease, reportedly for being asleep in the dressing room, in time following the consecutive dismissals of captain Umar Amin and Fawad Alam by Pakistan Television's pace bowler. Despite Shakeel eventually walking out after the quick wickets, the on-field umpire ruled him timed out.This dismissal marks the first high-profile instance of its kind since Angelo Mathews was timed out during the 2023 ODI World Cup match against Bangladesh. Shakeel is the ninth cricketer to be timed out in cricket history.The President's Trophy has attracted attention for its unique scheduling during the holy month of Ramadan. To accommodate Muslim players who fast from sunrise to sunset, matches are being played through the night, with sessions scheduled from 7:30 pm to 2:30 am.The tournament's nocturnal timing ensures players can participate while observing their religious obligations during Ramadan.One of the 10 modes of dismissals in the sport, the timed out rule was officially incorporated in the Laws of Cricket only in 1980. According to Law 40.1.1, ""After the fall of a wicket or the retirement of a batter, the incoming batter must, unless Time has been called, be ready to receive the ball, or for the other batter to be ready to receive the next ball within 3 minutes of the dismissal or retirement. If this requirement is not met, the incoming batter will be out, Timed out.""As per reports, Shakeel arrived in the middle after quick dismissals, but PTV captain Amad Butt appealed, and the umpires agreed that the Test batter was not ready within the stipulated three minutes.Shakeel's timed out dismissal was the first of its kind in First-Class cricket since 2017-18 and only the seventh overall.Besides Angelo Mathews' controversial dismissal during the 2023 World Cup, Ghana's Godfred Bakiweyem was the only other cricketer to be timed out in international cricket. It came in a T20I against Sierra Leone in 2023.",Saud Shakeel became the first Pakistan batter to be timed out in First-Class cricket.

SPURS BEATEN; ROMA, LYON WIN

Real Sociedad and Manchester United played a 1-1 draw in their Europa League last-16 first leg encounter on Thursday in San Sebastian, while Tottenham Hotspur went down 1-0 to AZ Alkmaar.United took the lead when Joshua Zirkzee struck from outside the box in the 57th minute, but Mikel Oyarzabal equalised from a penalty after Bruno Fernandes was penalised for handling the ball.The match followed a difficult period for Zirkzee, who had missed the crucial penalty in the FA Cup shootout defeat to Fulham the previous week. His challenging debut season at United continues, with the club's sole remaining chance for a trophy now resting in the Europa League competition.He found the back of the net for his first European goal this season, delivering a precise low shot from 20 yards following Alejandro Garnacho's well-placed pass.However, Ruben Amorim's team lost their lead when Fernandes committed a handball during a corner, resulting in Oyarzabal successfully converting the penalty.Andre Onana maintained parity with two outstanding saves as Real Sociedad sought a winning goal, setting up an balanced contest for next week's return fixture.An unfortunate first-half own goal by Lucas Bergvall resulted in Spurs' defeat in the Netherlands. The scoreline could have been more severe for Ange Postecoglou's team if not for Guglielmo Vicario's three excellent saves.Tottenham's troubles deepened when Dominic Solanke left the pitch with an injury after 20 minutes, cutting short his comeback from a seven-week knee injury layoff.Rangers secured a notable 3-1 victory on their visit to Fenerbahce, managed by Jose Mourinho.The Scottish side took an early advantage through Cyriel Dessers in Istanbul, though Alexander Djiku equalised for the Turkish team.Rangers, led by temporary manager Barry Ferguson, strengthened their position when Vaclav Cerny scored twice, including a goal nine minutes before the final whistle.Lyon made significant progress towards reaching the quarterfinals by securing a 3-1 win against Romanian side FCSB.There was an emotional moment when Nicolas Tagliafico scored, as Paulo Fonseca, who received a dugout ban until November from French football authorities following a heated exchange with a referee, became tearful whilst celebrating with his squad.After Alexandru Baluta had drawn FCSB level, Malick Fofana secured the victory for Lyon by scoring twice in the closing stages.In Italy, Uzbek striker Eldor Shomurodov delivered a dramatic finish, scoring with the last kick to give AS Roma a 2-1 triumph over Athletic Bilbao in their opening leg encounter.Paulo Dybala struck the crossbar for Roma before Inaki Williams put Athletic ahead with a header. Angelino equalised for the home side, and Shomurodov secured the victory after Athletic had a player dismissed.Lazio secured a dramatic victory at Viktoria Plzen, winning 2-1 despite being reduced to nine players, with Gustav Isaksen scoring in the 98th minute.The Italian side took the lead through Alessio Romagnoli, but Plzen equalised after half-time. Lazio subsequently lost Nicolo Rovella and Samuel Gigot to red cards before Isaksen's decisive goal.At Ajax, Eintracht Frankfurt recovered from a deficit to win 2-1, with Hugo Larsson and Ellyes Skhiri scoring after Brian Brobbey's 10th-minute opener.In another match, Bodo/Glimt defeated Olympiakos 3-0 at home, with Kasper Hogh scoring twice.","Manchester United and Real Sociedad play out 1-1 draw in Europa League last-16 first leg.

FIFA to consider expanding World Cup to 64 teams,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/top-stories/fifa-to-consider-expanding-world-cup-to-64-teams/articleshow/118772103.cms,"FIFA World Cup trophy (Agency Photo)

(This article originally appeared in The New York Times)

FIFA, the governing body for global football , is considering a plan that would increase the number of teams in the 2030 World Cup to 64 for a one-off expansion to mark the centenary of the event, the organization said on Thursday.The proposal, which was made toward the end of a FIFA board meeting on Wednesday, would upend a tournament that already figures to be unwieldy and complicated because it will be played across three continents for the first time.The World Cup is the most lucrative and most watched event in sports, bringing in billions for FIFA, but the coveted nature of the competition has led to battles among nations to host it, as well as widespread allegations in the past of corruption.The decision to award the 2034 World Cup to Saudi Arabia was criticized by good governance organizations, after FIFA changed its own rules to allow the country to effectively secure rights without facing any competition.The FIFA president, Gianni Infantino , has already overseen the expansion of the World Cup once during his nine-year tenure, bringing the number of teams up to 48 from 32 at the next edition in 2026, which will be mostly played in the United States but also include matches in Mexico and Canada.According to four people with direct knowledge of the discussions, the proposal for a 64-team tournament came as the meeting was drawing to a close and had reached the section of the agenda earmarked for ""miscellaneous"" issues.At that point, a delegate from Uruguay, Ignacio Alonso, made the proposal, reading a prepared speech in English.Three of the people with knowledge of the meeting, which was held via video, described the reaction from others present as stunned silence, and the proposals will almost certainly be met with a huge outcry.But they cautioned that FIFA was likely to be guided by financial and political benefits as much as sporting ones when it came to making a decision.Infantino, who has expanded his influence over the organization and the sport since he become the head of FIFA, acknowledged the proposal and said it should be analyzed more closely, according to the four people.Since assuming the highest office in global football, Infantino has made several attempts to reshape the sport, efforts that have often led to public disputes with many other prominent figures in the football world.A proposal to analyze a 64-team World Cup to celebrate the centenary of the event ""was spontaneously raised by a FIFA Council member in the 'miscellaneous' agenda item near the end"" of a board meeting, FIFA said in a statement after The New York Times first published details of the discussions.""The idea was acknowledged as FIFA has a duty to analyze any proposal from one of its council members,"" the statement added.The last time FIFA considered a major change to the World Cup, staging the event every two years instead of four, it formed a committee that worked on the project for a year before quietly mothballing the idea.Expanding the World Cup to 64 teams -- more than a quarter of FIFA's overall membership -- could render many of the regional qualification competitions for the event meaningless.Already, as many as seven teams out of 10 from South America can qualify for the 2026 World Cup, and further expanding the World Cup could reduce its appeal for broadcasters.There are also significant logistical issues. The tournament, with 32 teams, already takes about a month and would almost certainly run longer in an expanded format. The 48-team tournament in 2026 will feature a record 104 games.Under Infantino, FIFA has been constantly exploring ways to alter its marquee event, efforts that have usually been met with blowback from other parts of the football industry.On Wednesday, FIFA announced a collaboration with the British rock band Coldplay to put together a halftime show for the first time at a World Cup final when it is played in New Jersey next summer.The move is similar to what the NFL does with the Super Bowl, its showpiece event, but the announcement was greeted with yet more criticism.At one point, Infantino supported the effort to play the World Cup every two years rather than four, and a furious reaction -- largely from European football's governing body -- forced backers of the idea to shelve it.Saudi Arabia secured its event after FIFA announced that Uruguay, Paraguay and Argentina would join Morocco, Spain and Portugal in hosting matches for the 2030 tournament, narrowing the field for potential future hosts in 2034.The three South American nations were awarded one game each to commemorate the centenary of the tournament, which was first played in Uruguay in 1930.The expansion proposal comes amid regional frustration at automatic places for the three South American hosts for the 2030 World Cup -- particularly Paraguay, home of the regional confederation president, which has failed in recent attempts to qualify for the World Cup.Infantino secured the FIFA presidency in 2016 after a corruption scandal that led to the ouster of most of its previous leadership.He ran on a campaign of promising more funds to FIFA's 211 members and a promise to increase the size of the World Cup. Infantino now spends most of his time in Miami and has grown close to President Donald Trump, who recently described the FIFA president, whom he invited to his inauguration, as the ""king of soccer.""Infantino has spent most of his time in his office devising ways to leave a lasting legacy. As well as expanding the World Cup for both men and women, he has created a new World Cup for club teams that will be staged for the first time this summer in the United States.Trump's daughter Ivanka Trump took part in the draw that set up the competitions matchups at an event in Miami late last year.The new club competition is facing several headwinds, including sluggish ticket sales in the United States and a dispute with leagues and player unions, which have filed legal complaints in Europe.","FIFA considering a plan to increase the number of teams in the 2030 World Cup to 64.

Brazilian star Neymar has been called back to the national team by coach Dorival Junior for the upcoming 2026 World Cup qualifiers . This marks his return after an injury layoff of nearly 18 months.Neymar's last appearance for Brazil came in October 2023 during a defeat to Uruguay, where he was forced to leave the field due to injury. He had participated in Brazil's first four qualifying matches before this setback.Brazil's performance in the South American World Cup qualifying campaign has been challenging. They currently hold the fifth position among ten nations after 12 rounds, though they maintain a five-point lead over seventh-placed Bolivia.The upcoming qualifiers will see Brazil face Colombia on March 21, followed by a match against world champions Argentina five days later. Neymar has indicated that the 2026 World Cup will be his final tournament, when he will be 34 years old.In a recent development, Neymar scored his first goal in over 14 months during a Sao Paulo state championship match. He helped Santos secure a 3-1 victory against fourth division team Agua Santa.The 33-year-old converted a penalty in the 14th minute, marking his first goal in four appearances since rejoining Santos. This was his 137th goal in 229 matches for his boyhood club.Prior to this goal, Neymar's last scoring contribution came on October 3, 2023, while playing for Al Hilal in the Asian Champions League against Nassaji Mazandaran.After terminating his contract with Saudi club Al Hilal in January, Neymar returned to Santos, the club he had initially left in 2013 for Barcelona.His stint at Al Hilal lasted 18 months following his transfer from Paris Saint-Germain in August 2023. The move reportedly earned him 100 million euros per season.Neymar's time at Al Hilal was limited to just five appearances before he sustained a serious knee injury while representing Brazil against Uruguay.","Neymar has been called back to the Brazil squad for the upcoming 2026 World Cup qualifiers.

get rare away win

A brilliant strike by Brahim Diaz propelled Real Madrid to a 2-1 win against local adversary Atletico in their Champions League round of 16 first-leg encounter on Tuesday.The 15-time European champions have consistently held the upper hand against Atletico, who have managed just three victories in 11 UEFA competition encounters. Real Madrid had previously triumphed over Atletico in both their Champions League final meetings.A decisive moment of individual skill settled the tense match in the Spanish capital. Diaz secured Real Madrid's victory by manoeuvring past several Atletico defenders before placing a precise low shot into the far corner in the 55th minute.Atletico Madrid, under Diego Simeone, faced another disappointment against their city rivals, following previous final defeats in 2014 and 2016. They had also suffered eliminations in the knockout stages during the 2015 quarterfinals and 2017 semifinals.At their home ground, Santiago Bernabeu stadium, Real Madrid opened the scoring through Rodrygo's skilful effort. After receiving the ball on the wing, he moved into the penalty area, outpaced the defenders and placed a precise shot into the net.Atletico's patient approach yielded results in the 32nd minute through Julian Alvarez's remarkable effort. The striker received possession on the left side, moved into the box and executed a brilliant curling shot beyond Thibaut Courtois, marking his seventh goal in the competition this season.Arsenal, making their Champions League comeback following a six-year hiatus, initially struggled before Jurrien Timber headed in against the flow of play, moments after PSV struck the frame of the goal.The visitors subsequently took control of the match, establishing a three-goal advantage within thirty minutes.Young talent Ethan Nwaneri, aged 17, extended the lead in the 21st minute following precise team coordination in the penalty area. Mikel Merino subsequently capitalised on PSV's defensive disarray, scoring the third goal after multiple unsuccessful clearance attempts.Prior to the interval, Thomas Partey's unnecessary challenge on Luuk de Jong inside the penalty area provided PSV an opportunity, which Noa Lang successfully converted.Following the break, PSV's defence deteriorated. Arsenal's skipper Martin Odegaard netted twice, whilst Leandro Trossard and Riccardo Calafiori contributed additional goals to secure a comprehensive victory.Borussia Dortmund , who finished second last season, find themselves in a balanced position against Lille following the first leg's 1-1 stalemate, with Hakon Arnar Haraldsson securing the equaliser for the French side.The German team had taken the lead when Karim Adeyemi struck from distance with a precise shot in the 22nd minute, but Canadian striker Jonathan David's precise pass split the Dortmund defence in the 68th minute, allowing Haraldsson to score and restore parity.Aston Villa overcame their struggles in away matches to win 3-1, while also benefiting from an own goal by Club Brugge .The decisive moment occurred in the 82nd minute when Club Brugge's Brandon Mechele inadvertently directed the ball past his own goalkeeper with the score level at 1-1. His attempt to block Morgan Rogers' cross resulted in the ball finding its way into his own net.The hosts, visibly affected by the own goal, subsequently conceded a penalty which substitute Marco Asensio successfully converted.Prior to that, the Belgian team had displayed strong performance, dominated possession and generated superior opportunities in the second half.Villa's previous away record had been concerning, with two losses in the group stages of this competition, including one at Club Brugge. Their Premier League away performance also shows seven defeats in 13 matches.Villa conceded an early advantage when Leon Bailey found the net within three minutes of kickoff. Club Brugge responded swiftly, equalising just two minutes later. A long pass caught Villa's defence off guard, allowing Christos Tzolis to penetrate the box. His precise cut-back found Maxim De Cuyper unmarked, who struck cleanly with his left foot past Emiliano Martinez into the distant corner.",Real Madrid beat Atletico 2-1 in Champions League round of 16 first leg. Brahim Diaz's brilliant strike secured Real Madrid's victory. Aston Villa overcame their struggles in away matches to win 3-1. Borussia Dortmund drew 1-1 with Lille in their second leg encounter.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118724754,imgsize-45910,width-400,resizemode-4/118724754.jpg"
'The next big thing' in Indian tennis blooming under Rafael Nadal's watchful eyes: Maaya Rajeshwaran,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/top-stories/exclusive-the-next-big-thing-in-indian-tennis-blooming-under-rafael-nadals-watchful-eyes-maaya-rajeshwaran/articleshow/118757183.cms,"(Instagram Photo)

NEW DELHI: ""Learning, enjoying, and sharing time and experiences with these young and talented players,"" Rafael Nadal penned a post on X (formerly Twitter) not even a fortnight ago. The post featured an image of the tennis great at the center. To his left stood three teenage girls, and to his right, four more. On his far right, one could spot 15-year-old Maaya in her training attire, looking somewhat nervous, her right index finger tucked into her left fist.Nervousness was quite palpable - after all, the 22-time Grand Slam champion was right there in person at his Rafa Nadal Academy on the island of Mallorca, his watchful, forever-fiery eyes evaluating the teens.As for Maaya Rajeshwaran Revathi , this was her first meetup with the ""King of Clay"" after taking the tennis scene by storm with her exceptional performance at the Mumbai Open earlier this year.But here's a fun fact: Mumbai wasn't even on her calendar at the start of the year.""First of all, playing the Mumbai Open wasn't even part of the plan. My wildcard was confirmed just 2 days before the tournament,"" Maaya, born to father Rajeshwaran and mother Revathi in a Tamil family, told TimesofIndia.com in an exclusive chat. ""I was very confident that I'd compete well. Honestly, I didn't expect that I'd make it that far, but I just played match by match and gave my best.""Romping past opponents far more experienced than her, the rising star made waves across the tennis fraternity.As she reached the semi-finals at the Cricket Club of India and became the first 2009-born player to make semi-final of a WTA 125 event, some even clasped their hands in prayer, hoping for an outlandish title win. But a defeat to 27-year-old Jil Teichmann in the semis brought Maaya's dream run to an end.""After losing in the semi-finals, I was a bit upset because I didn't play as well as I hoped I would. But I had a lot of positives to take away from the Mumbai Open,"" added the rising star following the best series of results in her professional circuit so far.Even tennis was not part of Maaya's plan until she turned eight. For her, it was initially just a ""recreational sport"" after school.She decided to go pro when she was 10. At the heart of her journey are her parents, who, in Maaya's words, have been incredibly supportive.""I'm so blessed that my mom can travel with me. My home has always been my family, and also, I have a very good support system back home. Sometimes, I do miss them a lot,"" she told TimesofIndia.com. ""But specifically, I miss my dad so much. I'm very close to both my parents. I think if my dad would also be with me, I would feel very much like home.""At such a young age, staying abroad can make anyone homesick. Yet, this is exactly what Maaya had always wanted. She recalled, ""We were looking for a base in Europe last year, and the invitation from the Rafa Nadal Academy was quite surprising. But we were very happy that they took me in.""An avid reader and movie buff, Maaya also loves baking - baking, as she bakes, those chants already labelling her as the ""next big thing"" in Indian tennis. ""I'm definitely not worried about that. In fact, it's very supportive and encouraging to see people believe in me,"" she added.Currently, she is more into wading through the pages of the novel ""The Palace of Illusions"" by Chitra Banerjee Divakaruni as Maya reflected, ""If I could tell something to my younger self now, it would be to trust myself and the good people around me, no matter what happened, no matter if I didn't win, I just had to do what I love to do with all my heart.""You've probably heard these sayings: A life without a goal is like a ship without a rudder, a car without a steering wheel... or, for tennis fans, Rafael Nadal without a Grand Slam (not quite a famous one yet), but you get the idea.What is it that always drives Maaya?""The ultimate goal for me is to become the world no. 1 and win slams,"" sighed the current world no. 1 Aryna Sabalenka's aficionado.","Maaya Rajeshwaran Revathi, 15, is the first 2009-born player to make semi-final of a WTA 125 event. Tennis was not part of Maaya's plan until she turned eight. She decided to go pro when she was 10.

Naomi Osaka was bundled out of the first round at Indian Wells on Wednesday, falling 6-4, 6-4 to Camila Osorio in the Japanese star's first tournament since injury forced her out of the Australian Open.Former world number one Osaka, now ranked 56th in the world, looked rusty against the 52nd-ranked Colombian, struggling to find the range on her powerful groundstrokes on a chilly night in the California desert.Osorio, who challenged Osaka with an array of drop shots and slices, gained the lone break of the opening set for a 5-4 lead and served it out without a hitch, then broke Osaka to open the second.The Japanese star immediately broke back, but Osorio gained the upper hand with a break in the seventh game. After Osaka fought off a match point against her own serve Osorio served it out, fighting off four break points to seal it with a stinging forehand winner.It was a winning return from injury for Osorio, who pulled out of last week's event in Merida, Mexico, with an abdominal injury.Osaka, who returned from a 15-month break last year after giving birth to daughter Shai in 2023, reached her first final since 2022 in Auckland, but retired from the title match with an abdominal injury.Back for the Australian Open, she was forced to retire from her third round match with an abdominal strain.Osorio, owner of two WTA titles, booked a second-round meeting with Denmark's Clara Tauson, the 22nd seed, who took the title in Auckland when Osaka retired.Two-time Wimbledon champion Petra Kvitova, on the comeback trail seven months after giving birth to her son Petr, also fell in the first round.France's 70th-ranked Varvara Gracheva beat the Czech 4-6, 6-3, 6-4, but the 24-year-old was full of admiration for her 34-year-old opponent, who lifted the trophy at Wimbledon in 2011 and 2014.""If you let me step back a little bit, I really want to congratulate her,"" Gracheva said. ""Because she had a child quite recently, and I'm so happy that she now has the role of a mother and a tennis player, which is very demanding. It's very inspiring for sports, athletes, women -- it's just amazing.""All 32 men's and women's seeds have first round byes in this combined ATP Masters and WTA 1000 tournament.Gracheva lined up a second-round meeting with ninth-seeded Mirra Andreeva, the 17-year-old Russian who became the youngest ever WTA 1000 champion in Dubai last month.In other matches, French veteran Caroline Garcia beat US wild card Bernarda Pera 6-3, 6-4 to line up a second-round meeting with second-seeded defending champion Iga Swiatek.- Nishikori battles through -In men's action, Tallon Griekspoor of the Netherlands beat Miomir Kecmanovic of Serbia 6-7 (5/7), 6-4, 6-3 to book a second-round meeting with top-seeded German Alexander Zverev, who heads a field missing world number one Jannik Sinner as he serves a three-months drugs ban.China's Bu Yunchaokete defeated American Nishesh Basavareddy 7-5, 6-4 to book a second-round match against Russian fifth seed Daniil Medvedev, runner-up the past two years to Carlos Alcaraz -- who is seeded second as he chases a rare three-peat.Japanese veteran Kei Nishikori, who revealed during the Australian Open that he almost quit tennis last year after lengthy battles with injury, defeated Spain's Jaume Munar 6-2, 5-7, 7-6 (7/3) to line up a second-round match against 18th-seeded Ugo Humbert of France.Nishikori was treated for a leg injury in the third set and then soldiered through cramp to close out the victory.""It was not easy,"" Nishikori said. ""In the third set I was cramping pretty badly, but somehow I came back and won, so a very good match.""bb/rcw",Camila Osorio beats Naomi Osaka in first round of Indian Wells.

Emma Raducanu revealed she experienced severe emotional distress, unable to see clearly or breathe properly when she noticed a man who was intensely focused on her during a match.The British tennis star, who won the 2021 US Open, became upset during her match at the Dubai Championships last month due to the presence of this individual in the stands.The spectator, who had previously approached Raducanu during the tournament, was removed from the venue after she alerted the chair umpire during her second-round match against Karolina Muchova .Dubai police subsequently detained the individual, who signed an agreement to maintain distance from Raducanu. The WTA confirmed the person displayed obsessive behaviour.Speaking to British journalists at the BNP Paribas Open in Indian Wells, her first competition since the event, Raducanu described her distress.""I saw him in the first game of the match and I was like, I don't know how I'm going to finish'. I literally couldn't see the ball through tears. I could barely breathe. I was like, I need to just take a breather here'.""Despite continuing after the individual's removal, Raducanu lost 7-6 6-4.She explained that her post-match emotional response wasn't primarily due to the defeat.Speaking to the BBC, Raducanu acknowledged that while the situation could have been handled more effectively, security measures have been enhanced.""I'm always now very aware and not necessarily doing things on my own any more. I'm always with someone and always being watched,"" Raducanu told the BBC.Previously in 2022, authorities issued a restraining order against an obsessive supporter who visited her residence three times.Raducanu is scheduled to compete against Japan's Moyuka Uchijima, ranked 52nd globally, three positions above her, in Thursday's first round in California. The victor will face third-seeded Coco Gauff , as the top 32 players receive automatic advancement to round two.","Emma Raducanu reveals she experienced severe emotional distress when she noticed a man who was intensely focused on her during a match.

WTA Merida Open

Mérida:

World number four Jessica Pegula powered to her first WTA title of 2025 on Sunday, beating McCartney Kessler 7-5, 6-2 in an all-American final in Austin, Texas.Pegula, the top seed, claimed a seventh WTA title and her first since she won the 1000 event in Toronto last year.That was one of Pegula's two titles in a 2024 campaign in which she also reached the US Open final.In Kessler she stopped a fast-rising talent, whose first two WTA finals had yielded a pair of titles -- in Cleveland last August and at Hobart in January.The 25-year-old arrived in Austin riding high after claiming her first career top-10 player with an upset of Coco Gauff in the second round at Dubai.But she couldn't find a way past Pegula, who snapped a three-match losing streak in finals for a confidence-building crown heading into the prestigious hard court tournaments at Indian Wells and Miami.Pegula, the only top-10 player in the draw, dropped just one set all week.Kessler looked set to change that when she rallied from 0-2 down to take a 4-2 lead in the first set.But too many unforced errors from Kessler allowed Pegula to get back in front and after Kessler missed a chance to break in the 11th game she was broken in the next as Pegula pocketed the first set.Kessler broke Pegula to open the second, but Pegula won the next four games to seize control.Top-seeded American Emma Navarro capped a dominant week with a 6-0, 6-0 thrashing of qualifier Emiliana Arango in the final of the WTA Merida Open on Sunday.Navarro, seeded No. 1 for the first time, marched to her second WTA title without dropping a set, adding the 500-level crown to the title she won in Hobart last year.Navarro hadn't reached a final since, although she made it to the quarter-finals or better at the last three Grand Slams and came into the week ranked 10th in the world.She needed just 55 minutes to subdue Arango, becoming the first player to win a WTA final 6-0, 6-0 since Iga Swiatek blanked Karolina Pliskova in the 2021 Rome title match.Arango, a 24-year-old Colombian who made it past the quarter-finals of a WTA tournament for the first time this week, came into the tournament ranked 133rd in the world and will crack the top 100 when the new rankings are announced on Monday.","Jessica Pegula wins WTA title in Austin, Texas.

DUBAI: The US Open's decision to cut and change the draw of its mixed-doubles event has divided the locker-room on the men's and women's tours. The Open's plan is to reschedule mixed-doubles as a standalone feature during the qualifying draw, tossing out $1 million in prize-money.This year's mixed-doubles event in New York, perhaps inspired by the vibe of last year's 'Mixed Madness' mela, will feature 16 pairs as against the 32 that make up mixed-doubles draws at Grand Slams. It will be played on August 19-20, three days before the start of the main draw. The qualification process has also been changed, with eight teams earning direct entry courtesy their combined singles ranking, while the other eight teams will be wildcard entries. Rohan Bopanna , still going strong in doubles at almost 45 years, said it was a lost opportunity for doubles specialists, who look forward to playing two events in Grand Slams -- doubles and mixed doubles. ""I don't think any doubles players can really play the mixed doubles. This year's US Open will be the first Grand Slam where we are not playing two events,"" Bopanna told TOI on the sidelines of the Dubai Duty Free Tennis championships here.Bopanna believes doubles is still a popular option for singles players on the ATP Tour. ""All the guys who enjoy doubles play doubles on the circuit,"" Bopanna said. ""The system is such that you can use singles ranking to get into doubles, on the ATP Tour you see a bunch of guys playing doubles and they enjoy it.""Yuki Bhambri, the India No.2 in the individual doubles ranking, said the USTA knew exactly what they were doing when they wrung in the changes. ""Grand Slams especially have always talked about tradition, that's why they never want to shorten matches,"" he said. ""They do that when it suits them, obviously business over (other) interests. The mixed doubles for a lot of countries like Great Britain, India and Australia has been a source of Grand Slam achievement. You're never going to get an opportunity like that with what they've done.""""You're essentially having the singles guys play a practice week,"" the 32-year-old Bhambri said, adding, ""It is obviously a sad day and a loss for a lot of the doubles players. We've all spoken about that, everyone is aware of what they've done and how they've gone about it.""Last year's Mixed Madness exhibition event before the start of the main draw saw a number of high-profile singles players pairing up. American Coco Gauff said she wouldn't be playing the mixed event this time even though she enjoyed being a part of Mixed Madness last year. ""It's an interesting situation because (on one side) some (players) rely on mixed doubles and it's an event that's been there forever. On the other hand, I know they're trying to get more singles players involved, maybe grow the sport,"" Gauff said, ""I most likely won't be participating just because it's not a great time for me, it will take away from the preparation for US Open.""",The US Open has cut and changed the draw of its mixed-doubles event.

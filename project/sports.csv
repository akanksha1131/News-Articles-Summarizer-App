Kohli, Rohit, Surya, Pant: Who has the most to prove in Vijay Hazare?

NEW DELHI: India continued their dominant run in the women’s T20I series against Sri Lanka with another authoritative win on Tuesday. Chasing a small target, India cruised to a seven-wicket victory in the second match, taking a 2-0 lead in the five-match series. The star of the night was Shafali Verma, who played a fearless and fluent knock to finish the game quickly.Sri Lanka were first asked to bat and struggled against India’s disciplined bowling attack. The visitors could only manage 128 for 9 in their 20 overs.India’s spin unit did most of the damage, led by experienced off-spinner Sneh Rana and well supported by young spinners Vaishnavi Sharma and Shree Charani.They bowled with control and patience, not allowing Sri Lanka to build any real momentum.While chasing, India lost vice-captain Smriti Mandhana early for 14.However, Shafali Verma looked in complete control from the moment she arrived at the crease.Full of confidence after her strong showing in the World Cup final, she attacked the bowlers and took the game away from Sri Lanka. Shafali remained unbeaten on 69 from just 34 balls, hitting 11 boundaries and one six, as India wrapped up the chase in only 11.5 overs.Left-arm spinner Inoka Ranaweera bore the brunt of Shafali’s attack. Whenever the ball was tossed up, Shafali stepped out and struck cleanly over extra cover.Her footwork against spin was impressive, whether coming down the track or playing from the back foot.Seeing her confidence, newly appointed Delhi Capitals captain Jemimah Rodrigues joined the assault. Rodrigues scored a quick 26 off 15 balls, and together they added 58 runs in just 4.3 overs. By the time Rodrigues got out, the result was already decided.Earlier, Sneh Rana made full use of her opportunity after Deepti Sharma missed out due to fever.She returned excellent figures of 1 for 11 in four overs, including a rare maiden in T20 cricket. Shree Charani picked up 2 for 23, while Vaishnavi Sharma finished with 2 for 32.India’s fielding also stood out, with sharp efforts resulting in three run-outs after a below-par show in the previous match.Sri Lanka captain Chamari Athapaththu showed some fight with a quick 31 but was kept quiet by Rana’s smart bowling. Once she fell, Sri Lanka lost wickets quickly and never recovered.","India beat Sri Lanka by seven wickets to take 2-0 lead in T20 series.

Lack of institutional foundation

So, where is the next generation of Hungary?

Richárd Rapport (Photo by Lennart Ootes)

NEW DELHI: William Shakespeare wrote in, “Though she be but little, she is fierce.” Hungary, too, has never been the biggest country on the chess map. Yet, it has long played the game with a fearlessness that belies its size.With none of the resources of the Soviet Union or the institutional machinery that defines modern chess powerhouses, Hungary, a country of around 10 million people, nevertheless produced players who stood shoulder to shoulder with the world’s best.And it did so repeatedly, across generations, often without the kind of support structures that are considered essential today.Standing at the forefront of Hungarian chess now is World No. 13 Richárd Rapport, the country’s top-ranked player and one of the most creative grandmasters of his generation.Tall and fair-skinned, with an infectious smile and long, silky blond hair, Rapport is one of the circuit’s most recognisable figures. But bring up Hungarian chess, and the smile gives way to a rare seriousness.“I think, for us, we have had players, top, top level players, let’s say high level players, more or less ending with me for a long time, since I can remember,” Rapport told TimesofIndia.com on the sidelines of Global Chess League (GCL).“We had them in the 60s, 70s even.”By the middle of the 20th century, Hungarian players were already shaping global chess culture.As Budapest became a chess hub, cafés turned into places where ideas took shape, much like the smoke rings from long, lingering puffs of cigarettes. Hungarian players developed a reputation for a deep understanding of strategies and originality.But the golden age arrived most visibly in the post-Second World War decades.“We had Portisch,” Rapport added with some pride, knowing that for chess fans, the name needs no embellishment.“Portisch is still alive, of course, and he’s a big legend of chess. He was number three, number two at some point (in the world).”Lajos Portisch, nicknamed the ""Hungarian Botvinnik"", also was not just any strong player; he became a global icon at one time.For years, the nine-time Hungarian Champion was among the world’s top contenders, repeatedly challenging for the world championship after taking part in the World Chess Championship Candidates cycle a total of eight times (1966-1990).Alongside him were names like Zoltán Ribli and Gyula Sax, players who regularly found themselves in the world’s top ten.“This team with Ribli, Sax and all these guys,” Rapport recalled. “They were like, let’s say top 10 at some point or for a longer or shorter time, but still they were there.”Then came a chapter that went truly beyond medals and rankings. “Then we had the next era, right? Judit and Peter (Leko)” Rapport said. “Judit Polgár and Zoltan Almási also.”Judit Polgár, the youngest of the three famous Polgár sisters, did something no Hungarian before her had done and something no woman has done since.Refusing to be boxed into women-only competition, she played exclusively in open events against strong male competitors and forced the chess world to take notice.At her peak, she broke into the world’s top ten and defeated a roll call of world champions. She became the first woman to break 2700 Elo in July 2005 and defeated 11 reigning or former world champions, including Garry Kasparov, Anatoly Karpov, and Viswanathan Anand Alongside her was Peter Leko, the current Hungarian No. 2 and another product of Hungary’s quiet excellence, who would go on to challenge Vladimir Kramnik for the World Championship title in 2004.“It’s a very nice generation in a way,” Rapport smirked. For Hungary, it felt like continuity. One great generation handing the baton to the next.Rapport’s own rise coincided with what many insiders see as the peak of modern Hungarian chess: the 2014 Chess Olympiad in Tromsø, Norway.“So we took medal (silver) in Tromsø Olympiad,” Rapport said. “And then it kind of ended the generation, I think, in 2014, with me kind of joining the team.”What made that team remarkable wasn’t just the medal.“We had like four players above 2700,” he further explained. “Which is like great because we are a very small country.”In elite chess, 2700 is an unsaid benchmark of the world’s absolute top. For a small European nation to field four such players was almost unheard of.What followed, however, has not been a gradual decline, but something far stranger.“From that team, I’m still okay above 2700,” Rapport added. “And Peter, let’s say, came back to play, which is very nice. But the other guys just quit. Just altogether. They didn’t even lose their rating. They just vanished.”Within a few years, an entire generation of elite Hungarian players stepped away from top-level chess.The Hungarian team that clinched silver at the 2014 Olympiad featured eminent names such as Péter Lékó, Csaba Balogh, Zoltán Almási, Richard Rapport, and Judit Polgár.Today, with Rapport now 29, the rest, now in their late 30s or 40s, have either stepped away from competitive chess altogether or, like Lékó, appear only sporadically in top-level tournaments, largely focusing on commentary and other roles.For a country that had always relied on continuity, the gap was suddenly visible.Perhaps the most striking part of Rapport’s reflection is his admission that Hungary’s success was never built on strong institutional foundations.“I don’t think we really had a support built around chess,” he said. “Professional support. We had support for amateur chess or to hang around. But we never really had support for climbing the highest of the heights.“And somehow still people got there, individually or one way or the other.”How?“People just investing their own money, investing their own time, parents' timea lot when they were young,"" Rapport explained.For decades, that patchwork approach worked. But modern chess is a different beast. With the introduction of technology in chess, the game has become more demanding and resource-heavy.“We don’t really have the next generation,” Rapport stated bluntly. “We have some players, sure, but it’s not quite the same flavour, unfortunately. Maybe it’s a bit of bad luck also. Some talented kids are leaving chess for one reason or the other.”The Hungarian No. 1 doesn't want to be too negative, though.“I’m not super pessimistic about our situation in chess,” he added. “But also far from very happy and very satisfied.”Rapport understands Hungarian chess and believes that if the nation's chess setup seeks an overhaul, the responsibility lies across the ecosystem, from administrators to players to grassroots organisers.“Anyone could do more,” he said. “Not only on the top level, like the national team, but also lower-level people.However, being the top-ranked player of the country, Rapport also knows that he will have to take the lead if things are to be changed for good.""As they say, the fish stinks from its head. If we are doing well, more people will get inspired,” he remarked.He knows it won’t be easy.“It’s a very difficult mission to accomplish,” he concluded. “But I’m kind of hoping to help our chess, and maybe bring it back to its former glory.”","Hungary has never been the biggest country on the chess map. Yet, it has long played the game with a fearlessness that belies its size. With none of the resources of the Soviet Union or the institutional machinery that defines modern chess powerhouses, Hungary nevertheless produced players who stood shoulder to shoulder with the world's best.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126142354,imgsize-69740,width-400,resizemode-4/judit-polgr-and-richrd-rapport-photo-credit-fide.jpg"

The Vijay Hazare Trophy 2025–26 promises to be far more than a routine domestic one-day tournament, with the charismatic presence of Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma lending unprecedented gravitas to the competition that begins on Wednesday, December 24. For the first time in years, India’s biggest stars will share the domestic stage with the next generation, turning the spotlight firmly back on the country’s white-ball pipeline.Kohli and Rohit headline a star-studded field that also includes Rishabh Pant, Shubman Gill, Suryakumar Yadav and Abhishek Sharma. Yet, none draws as much attention as the celebrated duo, whose participation follows the BCCI ’s directive making it mandatory for centrally contracted players to feature in at least two Vijay Hazare matches. For Kohli, this marks his return to the tournament after 15 years, while Rohit’s appearance underlines the shifting power dynamics in Indian cricket.Rohit has confirmed he will play Mumbai’s opening two matches against Sikkim and Uttarakhand in Jaipur on December 24 and 26. Kohli, who has been training in Mumbai with former India batting coach Sanjay Bangar, is expected to turn out for Delhi in Elite Group D, with their opening fixtures scheduled in Bengaluru against Andhra Pradesh and Gujarat.Pant, a Test certainty, will be eager to reignite his white-ball credentials after not featuring in ODIs or T20Is since August 2024. Gill, overlooked for the T20 World Cup squad, will look to channel that disappointment into runs for Punjab, especially with an ODI captaincy assignment against New Zealand looming.Selectors will also keep a close eye on young bowling talent. With no pacer making a Siraj-like breakthrough in recent seasons, this edition could be pivotal for names such as Gurjapneet Singh (Tamil Nadu), Gurnoor Brar (Punjab), Yudhvir Singh (J&K), Anuj Thakral (Haryana) and Sakib Hussain (Bihar).The 2025–26 Vijay Hazare Trophy features 38 teams across Elite and Plate categories. The Elite division comprises 32 teams split into four groups of eight, with each side playing a round-robin league. The top two teams from each Elite group advance to the quarter-finals, followed by the semi-finals and final. The Plate group consists of six teams, with promotion and relegation in effect for the next season.Matches will be hosted across Ahmedabad, Bengaluru, Alur, Jaipur and Rajkot, with all games scheduled to start at 9 am.The Vijay Hazare Trophy 2025–26 will be broadcast live on the Star Sports Network in India, while live streaming will be available on the JioHotstar app and WBSuite.","The 2025–26 Vijay Hazare Trophy features 38 teams across Elite and Plate categories.

ECB to investigate 'excessive drinking' allegations

England head coach Brendon McCullum has admitted that his future is no longer in his own hands after a disastrous Ashes campaign that saw England surrender the urn 3-0 inside the first three Tests, triggering intense scrutiny of leadership, culture and direction.McCullum, who is contracted with the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) until the end of the 2027 ODI World Cup — a period that also includes the next home Ashes — struck a reflective yet defiant tone when questioned about whether he expects to remain in charge next summer.“I don't know. It's not really up to me, is it?” McCullum told reporters. “I will just keep trying to do the job, try to learn the lessons that I haven't quite got right here and make adjustments. Those questions are for someone else, not for me.”Despite the mounting criticism, the former New Zealand captain insisted his motivation remains intact, describing the England job as a privilege rather than a burden.“It's a pretty good gig. It's good fun. You travel the world with the lads and try to play some exciting cricket and try to achieve some things,” he said. “For me, it's a matter of trying to just get the very best out of the people and try to achieve what you can with them.”McCullum also pointed to progress made since his appointment, first as Test coach and later as overseer of England's white-ball teams. “I think we've made some progress from when I took over to where we are,” he said, while conceding that mistakes had been made during the ongoing Ashes.England's defeat in Adelaide extended their winless Test run in Australia to 18 matches, with their last series victory Down Under dating back to 2010–11 — a statistic that has further intensified calls for accountability.Off-field issues have compounded the pressure. England managing director Rob Key has vowed to investigate reports of “excessive drinking” during a mid-series break in Noosa while England were trailing 0-2.“If there's things where people are saying that our players went out and drank excessively then of course we'll be looking into that,” Key said. “Drinking excessive amounts of alcohol for an international cricket team is not something that I'd expect to see at any stage.”Key described allegations of a “glorified stag do” as “completely unacceptable” if proven, while stressing that early feedback suggested players were “very well behaved”.",Brendon McCullum admits his England future is no longer in his own hands.

Poll What do you think about Cooper Connolly's potential impact in the IPL 2026? He'll be a game-changer He'll contribute but no major impact Unsure, need to see him play! He won't perform as expected

MUMBAI: Heading into the IPL 2026 auction, Punjab Kings were seeking a replacement for Australian allrounder Glenn Maxwell, who chose to sit out the season. PBKS eventually signed 22-year-old Cooper Connolly for Rs 3 crore, viewing him both as a potential Maxwell-type option and a long-term investment.Connolly has been in red-hot form for Perth Scorchers in the ongoing Big Bash League, scoring 136 runs in two innings at an average of 68, including two fluent fifties at No. 3. An Australian spin-bowling allrounder like Maxwell, Connolly can hit cleanly, bowl useful left-arm spin and is an outstanding fielder— traits that have triggered early comparisons.Asked about those parallels in a virtual media interaction on Monday, Connolly was quick to play them down. “The comparisons to Maxie, I’ll take it. But he’s a world class player. I’m a long way from being as good as him,” he said.Instead, Connolly stressed that his focus is solely on contributing to Punjab Kings in his maiden IPL season. “I’m just looking forward to playing positive cricket and winning games for Punjab. Last year they didn’t quite win it, but this year looks promising. I’m excited to get over there and chase the trophy.”PBKS captain Shreyas Iyer has indicated that Connolly could be used as a finisher, but the youngster says he is happy batting anywhere. “I’m still learning the No. 3 role with the Scorchers and enjoy it. But if my role in the IPL is different, that’s totally fine. I like being versatile—whether it’s at three or in the middle order, I’m happy to perform whatever role the team needs.”Connolly is also relishing the challenge of the IPL’s intensity and conditions. “It’s probably the most competitive tournament in the world, and I’m looking forward to testing myself against the best bowlers.”Acknowledging the contrast with Australian pitches, he admitted adapting to spin will be crucial. “Australia has fast, bouncy wickets, but playing spin in India is a big challenge. It’s about learning from those who’ve done it for years and adapting my methods. There are some quality spinners in the IPL, and I’m really looking forward to that challenge.”Though he hasn’t played much international cricket-just one Test, eight ODIs and 6 T20Is- the 22-year-old, who is a regular member of the Australia A side, gave a glimpse of his special ability when he smashed 71 not out off 53 balls to star in Australia’s two-wicket win over India in the second ODI at Adelaide in Oct 23.","Cooper Connolly has been in red-hot form for Perth Scorchers in the ongoing Big Bash League.

Poll Do you agree with the decision to rest Pat Cummins for the remainder of the Ashes series? Yes, it's the right call No, he should play

Australia have left out Test captain Pat Cummins for the remainder of the Ashes series, opting to put the fast bowler “on ice” after sealing the urn, with coach Andrew McDonald adamant the decision is about protecting his long-term future.Cummins, who returned from a back stress injury to take six wickets in Adelaide and clinch the series, will not feature again this summer, with his availability for February's T20 World Cup now under assessment.“He won't play any part in the rest of the series,” McDonald said on Tuesday. “We were taking on some risk with his return, and we've now won the series, which was the goal. To position him for further risk and jeopardise him long term is not something that we want to do.“Pat's really comfortable with that. Everything went really smoothly, and to get him back, take six wickets and nail the Ashes was incredibly pleasing for everyone.”While Cummins rests, Australia remain confident Mitchell Starc will front up for the Boxing Day Test despite having bowled close to 100 overs in the series. The 35-year-old left-armer, who cracked England's Adelaide chase with three late wickets, has been labelled a physical anomaly by the medical staff.“Starc's amazing,” McDonald said. “He's pulled up fine. I walked into the physio room and was told, ‘He's a freak'. He keeps running in and presenting the pace that he does. He's given up a lot of IPL opportunities because he wants to play Test cricket, and he's still at his best.”Scott Boland is on track to overcome a hip niggle for his home Test, while Jhye Richardson, Michael Neser and Brendan Doggett are all in the mix to replace Cummins, depending on conditions at the MCG.McDonald also praised Cricket Australia's medical team for backing Richardson's shoulder surgery earlier this year. “That decision, we're seeing the reward for it now,” he said. “He's on the selection table and looks ready to go.”",Australia have left out Test captain Pat Cummins for the remainder of the Ashes series.

New Delhi:

Sam Curran: 'People like it, people hate it, if you're a good team, you don't need an Impact Player'

EXCERPTS:

​Q. When you made your international debut, you were very young. And you got exposure very quickly. You were in a difficult position. You played in high-pressure moments. Thinking about it today, do you consider the early exposure you got playing in high-pressure situations to be a good thing or a bad thing? How do you see it as a cricketer today?

Naseem:

Naseem Shah has taken five wickets from five matches played in the ILT20. (Image: Creimas)

​​​Q. You have seen a lot of injuries in your career. There have been a lot of setbacks. It is very difficult for any professional cricketer. But it is, maybe, even more difficult for a bowler to bring back the rhythm. To bring back the match consistency. To understand what your best is. How difficult is it to restore it? And how much have you learned from your injuries?

Naseem:

Even the world's fittest players can't escape injury. No matter how fit you are. Injuries have to come in your life. So you have to be mentally prepared for that. If you get injured, it counts the same whether you're fit or not. Naseem Shah

Q. One thing I wanted to understand from a bowler's perspective. What is more difficult to recover from: an injury or a lack of form?

Naseem:

Q. In the last few years, since the start of T20 leagues, there has been a lot of preference by pitch curators, organisers, teams that batters get more preference. Everyone wants more runs as it is more entertainment. How does a bowler feel that everything is going in favour of the batter?

Q. For Indian and Pakistani players, when you are bowling, there is massive expectation. Especially if it is an India vs Pakistan match. But there is expectation. How do you ignore it or keep it aside? How do you stay in the present?

Naseem:

Q. How difficult and different does it feel to get criticised by a fan versus a former player? What is the difference between the two, especially if you feel that the criticism is unfair?

Naseem:

Poll What do you think is more difficult for a fast bowler to recover from? Injury Lack of form

In an era where T20 cricket is increasingly packaged as boundary-fuelled entertainment, fast bowlers often feel like collateral damage -- judged harshly by numbers, deprived of friendly conditions, and discarded quickly when the spotlight shifts elsewhere.For someone like Naseem Shah, the challenge has been even more layered. Still only 22 years old, Naseem has already lived through the full cycle of modern cricket: early stardom, serious injuries, form slumps, relentless scrutiny from fans, and pointed criticism from former players who know the game all too well.Yet, as the fourth season of the ILT20 unfolds, the fast bowler finds himself in a happier place. Representing the Desert Vipers, Naseem has been part of a dominant start to the season, with the team surging towards the playoffs on the back of six straight wins.In this conversation, he speaks candidly about survival as a fast bowler in batter-friendly cricket, the grind of injury comebacks, and learning to live with criticism in a sport that never truly switches off.I don't think about my early career. I don't have any good or bad memories.But life goes on like this. Day by day, as I always say, you learn something. There is a difference between then and now. You get a lot of experience while playing.As I said, you don't know a lot of things in the early stages. If you go 2-3 years back, you will get a lot of positive changes. And after 2 years, you will realise that life goes on like this. You get experience while playing. You get better and better. My advice is that if you are not a professional player, you can't relax. You can't say that I am done, I have learned everything, I am a professional player. You have to learn something until you play the last ball of your career. You have to bring some improvement in yourself. This is what is going on right now. That's why we play.It is exactly like this. When you feel that you are about to play your best cricket. You get consistency in your form. And when you have an injury there, it is a very difficult time. Because injuries take you completely back.First you have to fight the injury, then heal that injury. Then you have to bring back that fitness.And then performance is totally different. What you play on the ground is totally different. For that you need matches. To bring back that rhythm. I don't think there's any bowler who comes back after an injury and does the same performance that he was doing.It is obviously a difficult time. But as a player you know that these things have to come in your life. As a fast bowler you have to keep these things in mind. And keep fighting till you want to play cricket.Honestly speaking, with injuries, your cricket completely stops. So you learn a lot of things. You get good people at that time. You are mentally strong. You fight a lot. You come out of the stage.So this process, the rehab as well, you learn a lot of things. So as a fast bowler you can't escape injuries. Mostly the fans who watch cricket, they don't have the awareness that a dive injury and a sudden injury or an injury due to fitness - they are totally different. Different things.So even the world's fittest players can't escape that injury. No matter how fit you are. Injuries have to come in your life. So you have to be mentally prepared for that. Because if you get injured. The injury counts the same whether you're fit or not.When you come out of rehab, a lot of things are better in cricket. When you come back to your peak, you become very strong.​​​This is a very easy question and I think anyone will agree - out of form. If you play one good inning, all your things will be the same again.Out of form, in fast bowlers, unlike in batters, it depends on the rhythm. And it depends more on fitness. Performance comes. Batters are a little different when they are out of form. Because they have the option of one ball. If a good ball comes, they get out.So I think both are a little different. But coming from an injury. It is totally different. It is very difficult to come back to that rhythm.When you're out of form, all your things are with you. Your fitness is with you. You're just one inning away from getting things back.It feels very bad. Very bad. Nowadays, people want entertainment. And it is being delivered to them. In such cricket, as a fast bowler, you have to be smart and give your best performances.When there are matches of 140, 150, 160 runs, it may look boring, but bowlers get a lot of support. Nowadays, in T20 cricket, an economy rate under 9 is considered best, but it isn't always appreciated.A batter looks beautiful, they hit shots, they score runs. He looks good. But if a bowler goes at an economy rate of 8.5 in a T20, on a pitch which is worth 180, 190, 200 runs ... the coaches appreciate this because they have an idea. Considering how fast cricket is, these things matter. Bowlers have to work to get out of this situation and give his best performance. He does his best bowling.If you see, fans from India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka are very involved. You can say, they are very excited. They expect from you. They respect you. But there is pressure. It is fun. The whole nation is expecting of you. That you will do well. And if you do not do well, then there are plenty of memes also. So, there are both things and it has its own fun.Expectation is a good thing. But you have to be ready for this. If you see the best players in the world, their performance may be better, but our fans appreciate our performances also. And we get criticised a lot as well. So there's both things.You just have to be mentally ready. Now it is a habit. We know that our people love cricket a lot, they will give us love. And they will tell us if we do not do well.​​When fans do it, you should not take it to heart. Some cricket-loving fans have never held a cricket ball or visited a cricket ground... So you do not take it to heart. They are only expressing their emotions. So you do not take it to heart.But a former cricketer, who has played cricket all their life, if he talks about cricket. You learn from him. It is a good thing. You take what you like. But if the criticism is unfair, if it is personal... Or if you feel it is not about cricket, it is about something else. It happens.But for the rest of the fans, these days everyone has a phone. Someone has to say something. You cannot control that. People turn on their cameras and have things to say.You have to understand that if you start to care about everything, you are not a strong cricketer. Because you cannot stop anyone. You have to think, whether the person who is saying these things, if he has ever played in a pressure situation.They are crazy about cricket, they love cricket. When I was young, I used to do it too. But there should be fair criticism. And as a professional, you have to tolerate that.","Naseem Shah has played 20 Tests, 34 ODIs and 33 T20Is for Pakistan.

Kohli, Rohit, Surya, Pant: Who has the most to prove in Vijay Hazare?

JAIPUR: While the buzz around domestic cricket is always a welcome sight, it has become a rarity in recent years. For Jaipur’s passionate fans, that electric atmosphere typically materialises only during the Indian Premier League (IPL) or the rare white-ball international hosted at the Sawai Mansingh (SMS) Stadium.But Wednesday will be special as the Vijay Hazare Trophy 2025-26 gets underway, with Jaipur hosting Elite Group C matches.Mumbai’s campaign begins in the city, and fans are in for a treat: former India captain Rohit Sharma is set to play their opening fixtures against Sikkim (December 24) and Uttarakhand (December 26) at SMS Stadium.Rohit’s participation follows the BCCI’s mandate requiring all centrally contracted Indian players to feature in at least two Vijay Hazare Trophy matches when available, a move aimed at ensuring match fitness ahead of international commitments.The excitement around Rohit, one of India’s biggest sporting icons, is expected to draw large crowds for a domestic fixture that is usually played in front of empty stands.With the ground having seen crowd-control challenges during a Ranji Trophy match last month, the Rajasthan Cricket Association (RCA) is leaving nothing to chance on the security front.“We have arranged comprehensive police security as well as private bouncers.I have personally met the Additional SP (South), who has assured full support. All our security arrangements are firmly in place, as you saw during the practice session as well,” said ad hoc convener Deendayal Kumawat.The RCA has also had the stadium cleaned. “We have readied the stadium so that fans do not face any inconvenience. Wild plants and bushes have been removed, and we will also provide free drinking water. We will initially open the North and East stands, but if needed, other stands will also be opened,” Kumawat added.",Rohit Sharma set to play for Mumbai in Vijay Hazare Trophy 2025-26.

Throwback: When MS Dhoni began his journey in Indian cricket — with a golden duck,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/throwback-when-ms-dhoni-began-his-journey-in-indian-cricket-with-a-golden-duck/articleshow/126142942.cms,"MS Dhoni made his international debut on this day in 2004 against Bangladesh (Photo by ICC)

Why Suryakumar Yadav the batter could hurt India at T20 World Cup

NEW DELHI: On this day in 2004, Indian cricket welcomed a name that went on to change the game's history forever. Mahendra Singh Dhoni made his international debut for India in an ODI against Bangladesh in Chittagong.At the time, there was little fanfare.He was just another debutant, a long-haired wicketkeeper from Ranchi, a town rarely associated with Indian cricketing stardom.Few outside close cricketing circles truly knew who he was.Fewer still could have imagined that this young man would one day become one of the most influential figures the game has ever seen.Dhoni did not come through elite academies or age-group teams with heavy media attention.Instead, his rise was built on performances in domestic cricket and strong outings for India A.What caught the selectors’ eyes was not just his ability to score runs, but how he scored them: with power and a fearless approach.Besides his batting duties, he was also a natural wicketkeeper, quick behind the stumps and unafraid of responsibility.When Dhoni was handed his debut cap in Chittagong, India were in a phase of transition.Senior players were nearing the end of their careers, and the team was searching for new match-winners. Dhoni was slotted in at No. 7, a position that demanded adaptability more than glamour. His role was clear: keep wickets and finish games when required.What followed, however, was not the fairytale start many might expect.Dhoni’s first international innings lasted just a few seconds. A misunderstanding with Mohammad Kaif led to a run-out, and Dhoni walked back to the pavilion on a golden duck.For a dubutant, going out like that means confidence can shatter, and opportunities often dry up. But Dhoni was made of a different material.Even in that brief appearance, those watching closely noticed something special. There was no visible panic, no sign of being overwhelmed by the occasion.Behind the stumps, he was lively and alert. His movements were sharp, his throws flat and fast.He spoke little, observed a lot, and seemed comfortable at the highest level almost immediately. Inside the Indian dressing room, there was a growing belief that this was not a one-match experiment.Just two matches later, Dhoni walked out to bat against Pakistan in Visakhapatnam and played an innings that would change the course of his career, and Indian cricket to a certain extent.His 148 off 123 balls was fearless, brutal, and utterly unforgettable.He took on some of the best bowlers in the world with audacity, launching them over the boundary with ease. The long hair, the helicopter-like bat swing, and the sheer confidence of that knock captured the imagination of fans overnight.From that moment, Dhoni was no longer just another wicketkeeper.He was a match-winner.Indian cricket had found a player who could turn games on their head, especially under pressure.More importantly, he redefined what was expected from a wicketkeeper-batter.No longer was the role limited to glovework and modest contributions with the bat.Dhoni showed that a wicketkeeper could be a team’s most dangerous batter.The raw aggression of his early days turned into calculated calm.Soon, he became a master of reading match situations as he would take games deep before delivering the final blow.Fans grew used to seeing him finish matches with boundaries.Leadership soon followed. Dhoni was handed the captaincy in stages, first in T20s and then in ODIs and Tests.Many questioned whether a player with such a short international career was ready to lead.Dhoni answered those doubts in his manner.India won the 2007 T20 World Cup, the 2011 ODI World Cup, and the 2013 Champions Trophy under his captaincy as he became the only captain in cricket history to win all three major ICC trophies.Off the cricket field, he backed young players, absorbed pressure, and rarely let emotions dictate decisions.His calm presence in the dressing room became legendary. Teammates spoke of how his silence could be reassuring.In a country obsessed with cricketing heroes, Dhoni stood out for his nonchalant attitude.Looking back from 2025, Dhoni’s debut feels almost poetic. A run-out for a duck, followed by a career that taught patience, resilience, and belief.His story reminds us that first impressions can be misleading, and that true greatness often reveals itself over time. Not every beginning is loud.Twenty-one years on, that day in Chittagong holds a special place in Indian cricket history.It was the day a legend took his first step, unaware of the path ahead.From a small-town boy with long hair to a global icon known simply as “Captain Cool” Dhoni’s journey remains one of the most inspiring tales the sport has ever told.",MS Dhoni made his international debut on this day in 2004 against Bangladesh. The long-haired wicketkeeper from Ranchi is now one of the game's most influential figures. His first international innings lasted just a few seconds after a misunderstanding with Mohammad Kaif.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126143380,imgsize-38942,width-400,resizemode-4/ms-dhoni-made-his-international-debut-on-this-day-in-2004-against-bangladesh-photo-by-icc.jpg"

Why Suryakumar Yadav the batter could hurt India at T20 World Cup

MUMBAI: At a time when the Board of Control for Cricket in India ( BCCI ) has instructed all Indian players, including senior stars and former captains Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli , to feature in at least two matches of the upcoming Vijay Hazare Trophy, an exception has been made for Jasprit Bumrah .The decision has been taken with a clear focus on managing the fast bowler’s workload.India are set to enter a packed white-ball calendar.From January 11, they will host New Zealand for an eight-match white-ball series, starting with three ODIs, followed by five T20Is from January 21.After that, India begin their T20 World Cup campaign on February 7 against the USA at the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai.With so much cricket lined up, the team management has opted to carefully manage Bumrah’s schedule.As a result, Bumrah will not represent Gujarat in the Vijay Hazare Trophy, which begins on Wednesday.The 32-year-old pacer has a history of injury concerns and underwent back surgery in New Zealand in 2023. Given that background, rest has been prioritised over domestic participation.“Bumrah will not feature in VHT as he is taking rest,” Gujarat Cricket Association secretary Anil Patel told TOI from Ahmedabad on Tuesday.Bumrah has been on a demanding run in recent months. He played in the Asia Cup (T20 format), featured in all four home Tests against the West Indies and South Africa, toured Australia for a five-match T20I series, and then played a five-match home T20I series against South Africa.During this period, he was rested for the three-match ODI series against Australia (away) and South Africa (home).In the recent T20I series against the Proteas, Bumrah picked up four wickets in three matches at an average of 19.75, while maintaining an economy rate of 7.18.Meanwhile, Gujarat will still have international representation in the Vijay Hazare Trophy.Left-arm spinner Axar Patel , who missed the last two T20Is against South Africa due to viral fever, is set to feature in the tournament.Gujarat are scheduled to play their league matches in Bengaluru.Veteran all-rounder Ravindra Jadeja will also be in action, turning out for Saurashtra in their Vijay Hazare Trophy matches on January 6 and 8.","Bumrah will not represent Gujarat in the Vijay Hazare Trophy, which begins on Wednesday.

Sam Curran: 'People like it, people hate it, if you're a good team, you don't need an Impact Player'

Former Pakistan captain and DP World ILT20 commentator Shoaib Malik believes the league has become a strong symbol of cricket’s expanding global reach, with Associate Member nations and UAE players increasingly making their presence felt alongside established international stars.Speaking during a media interaction, Malik highlighted the tournament’s distinctive squad composition rule, which allows teams to field up to nine overseas players. He said this structure has created opportunities for Associate Member cricketers and local talents to test themselves against top level players and succeed.According to Malik, the performances of these players send a powerful message about how rapidly the game is growing. He pointed out that not too long ago, top level cricket was limited to a small group of countries, whereas the T20 World Cup now features 20 teams, reflecting the sport’s wider reach.The former all rounder also welcomed the league’s efforts to broaden its regional impact. At the DP World ILT20 Season 4 Player Auction, every franchise picked one player each from Kuwait and Saudi Arabia. Malik described this as a positive step and said involving players from Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and the UAE was a strong sign for the future of cricket in the region.Malik, who finished his international career with 11,867 runs and 218 wickets across formats, reserved special praise for UAE bowlers who have stood out in the ongoing season. He singled out Dubai Capitals spinner Haider Ali, noting his confidence and calmness while bowling to big names. Malik said Haider’s ability to stick to his plans, even when batters are well set, has been impressive. Haider Ali has claimed eight wickets in eight matches so far, with an economy rate of 6.40.He also applauded Desert Vipers pacer Khuzaima Tanveer and MI Emirates opener Muhammad Waseem. Malik noted that Khuzaima has emerged as one of the leading wicket takers this season with 13 wickets, while Waseem has continued to deliver whenever given the chance. Malik expressed hope that these players carry their form into major international tournaments.Reflecting on his own connection with the UAE, Malik said the region holds special memories for him. His international debut came in Sharjah, and after 2009, Pakistan played much of their cricket in the UAE, enjoying significant success. He also recalled featuring in the 2021 T20 World Cup there, where Pakistan reached the semi finals. Malik said the UAE is a place he always enjoys returning to and one he values deeply whenever he gets the opportunity to spend time there.",Former Pakistan captain and DP World ILT20 commentator Shoaib Malik believes the league has become a strong symbol of cricket’s expanding global reach.

Former India spinner Amit Mishra has weighed in on India’s 0-2 Test series loss to South Africa, emphasising the need for senior players to take responsibility and guide the younger members of the squad. Speaking to ANI, Mishra stressed that both experienced campaigners and newcomers must adjust their game according to the conditions and the bowling attack.Mishra, who represented India in 68 international matches and claimed 156 wickets—including 76 in 22 Tests at an average of 35.72—highlighted that the recent defeat was a stark reminder of India’s struggles at home against top SENA (South Africa, England, New Zealand, Australia) teams. November’s series saw dominant performances from South Africa’s Temba Bavuma , Marco Jansen, and Simon Harmer , handing India their second successive home series whitewash after last year’s 0-3 loss to New Zealand, ending a 12-year streak of home dominance.“We will have to bat according to the wicket and show maturity,” Mishra said. “Not every pitch allows you to score 200-220 runs. Some matches can be won with totals of 140-170. While inexperience exists, seniors have to stand up and guide youngsters on which shots to play, which bowlers to target, and which deliveries to respect.”On the issue of India’s use of spin-friendly pitches, Mishra defended the tradition, stressing patience and respect for quality bowling.“We have been playing on such wickets for years. Players need to show maturity, stay patient, and respect good bowlers. Coaches also need to instil the right mindset,” he said.Mishra also backed head coach Gautam Gambhir and his staff amid criticism. “They need time. It’s not like the team hasn’t won under them. We lifted the Asia Cup and Champions Trophy. Players must take responsibility. Seniors must guide the youngsters, and youngsters must step up. Coaches can’t play on the field—it’s the players who have to execute the plans, understand match-ups, and make the right decisions,” he added.",Former India spinner Amit Mishra has weighed in on India’s 0-2 Test series loss to South Africa.

Poll Will Ravindra Jadeja make an impact in the upcoming Vijay Hazare Trophy matches? Yes, he will perform excellently Yes, but will have a moderate performance No, he won’t perform well Not sure about his performance

India all-rounder Ravindra Jadeja has confirmed his participation in the Vijay Hazare Trophy for Saurashtra and is likely to feature in two fixtures on January 6 and January 8 against Services and Gujarat, respectively. Both the games will be played in Alur and as per Jadeja's communication with the Saurashtra Cricket Association (SCA), he will turn up for both the matches.""Yes, he has confirmed to play these two games on January 6 and January 8. This is the plan for now,"" a senior SCA official told TimesofIndia.com.There could be an alteration to the plan if Jadeja is picked for the ODIs against New Zealand and the team assembles early in Vadodara for the series opener on January 11. As of now, he is likely to get game time in the last two group stage games.Jadeja was overlooked for the ODIs in Australia but returned for the recently-concluded series against South Africa. Pipped by Axar Patel for the series Down Under, the 37-year-old managed to pick only one wicket in the three games and contributed 56 runs with the bat in the two innings he batted.There were speculations after the Australia snub that Jadeja was no longer in the scheme of things and chief selector Ajit Agarkar's comment further fuelled the fire.""He is very much in the plans. But there will be some competition for places. Of course, he was there in the Champions Trophy squad, because we took those extra spinners with the conditions there. At the moment, we could only carry one and get some balance in the team with Washi and Kuldeep there as well. And I don’t think we are going to need more than that in Australia,"" Agarkar had said after the team for the Australia series was announced.The left-hander is 37 and facing stiff competition from Axar Patel for the spot. Unlike the Champions Trophy in Dubai, India are highly unlikely to carry two left-arm spin all-rounders for the 2027 World Cup in South Africa. In absence of Jadeja in Australia, Axar returned as the second highest run-getter for India in the series with 75 runs in three innings and picked three wickets in as many as games.","India all-rounder Ravindra Jadeja has confirmed his participation in the Vijay Hazare Trophy.

Poll Do you think Aston Villa can win the Premier League this season? Yes, they have a strong chance No, they will fall short Not sure yet They need to improve further

Aston Villa continued their stunning Premier League title charge on Sunday as Morgan Rogers’ brilliant brace sealed a 2-1 victory over Manchester United at a raucous Villa Park, extending Unai Emery’s side’s extraordinary winning run.Rogers put Villa ahead late in the first half with a moment of individual brilliance before restoring the lead after the break, his goals securing a 10th consecutive victory in all competitions and keeping the Midlands club firmly in the title conversation.Third-placed Villa now sit just three points behind leaders Arsenal and one adrift of Manchester City, chasing what would be their first English league title since 1981. Their current run is their best in all competitions since 1914, while seven straight top-flight wins marks their strongest league streak since the 1989-90 season.Villa’s rise has been remarkable given their dismal start to the campaign, when they collected just two points and scored a single goal from their opening five matches — their worst beginning for 28 years. Under Emery, however, Villa Park has become a fortress, with only one Premier League home defeat in 2025, fewer than any other side.Even Manchester United, who had lost just once in their previous 26 visits to Villa, could not halt Emery’s momentum. United briefly responded after Villa’s opener, Matheus Cunha finishing clinically after Matty Cash gifted possession on the stroke of half-time.But the loss of captain Bruno Fernandes to an apparent hamstring injury at the interval proved decisive. Already depleted by injuries, suspension and Africa Cup of Nations absences, Ruben Amorim’s side lacked control after the break.Villa regained the lead in the 57th minute when Rogers showed greater hunger than Leny Yoro, pouncing on a loose ball in the box and finishing confidently for his sixth goal in as many league appearances. Emery celebrated wildly on the touchline, tossing his jacket skywards as Villa closed in on another statement win.United had chances to respond, with Emiliano Martinez producing key saves and Cunha wasting a gilt-edged header, but Villa held firm. Amorim handed a debut to teenager Jack Fletcher late on, yet the evening belonged to the hosts.",Aston Villa beat Manchester United 2-1 at Villa Park on Sunday. Morgan Rogers scored a brace to extend his side's winning run to 10 matches. Villa now sit just three points behind leaders Arsenal and one adrift of Manchester City.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126115708,imgsize-167688,width-400,resizemode-4/aston-villa-vs-manchester-united-premier-league.jpg"

Fans throw objects, vandalise stadium after Messi leaves early | Hyderabad next

NEW DELHI: Former India football captain Bhaichung Bhutia has strongly criticised the chaos that took place during Lionel Messi ’s public event at the Salt Lake Stadium in Kolkata.Speaking on Sunday, Bhutia called the incident unfortunate and said sports events should always be treated with importance, without unnecessary delays caused by politics or formalities.He said fans come to stadiums to enjoy the sport and watch their favourite players, not to sit through long speeches or wait for VIPs to arrive.“I think when there is a sports event, sports should get priority,” he said.He also pointed out that this problem is seen often across India. According to Bhutia, many sporting events are delayed because organisers wait for politicians or chief guests. He said such practices only harm the experience for fans and players.“Many times across India, we see sporting events getting delayed because of political speeches, chief guest handshakes and all that. That is not necessary. Fans and players are coming to watch the sport, and the sport should begin rather than waiting for VIPs.”Talking about Lionel Messi’s recent G.O.A.T. Tour of India, Bhutia said the response from fans clearly showed what people really want. He said fans in Kolkata and other cities only wanted to see Messi and enjoy the sport, without any extra drama.“It was good to see not just in Kolkata, but across different cities, fans just wanted to see the sporting event, who just wanted to see Messi and nothing else.”Bhutia hopes that what happened in Kolkata will act as a wake-up call for organisers and authorities in the future.“I hope this is a lesson we will learn and that this trend will change,” he added.The promotional event featuring Lionel Messi turned chaotic due to poor planning and crowd control.Thousands of fans were disappointed as politicians, celebrities and officials surrounded Messi, limiting his interaction with the public.His time on the field was also cut short. Frustrated by the situation, some spectators created disturbances inside the stadium.","Bhaichung Bhutia has strongly criticised the chaos that took place during Lionel Messi’s public event at the Salt Lake Stadium in Kolkata.

Armando Broja grabbed Burnley's equalizer in the 90th.Sunderland is doing much better since promotion.

Lionel Messi India tour: Inside story of what went wrong in Kolkata

NEW DELHI: Satadru Dutta, the main organiser of Lionel Messi’s event held on December 13 and now under arrest, has told investigators that the footballer was unhappy with physical contact during his appearance at the Salt Lake Stadium and left the venue before completing the scheduled programme, news agency PTI reported on Saturday, quoting a source in the Special Investigation Team (SIT).During questioning, Dutta told SIT officers that Messi ""did not like being touched on the back or being hugged"" and that this concern had been communicated in advance by foreign security officials assigned to protect the footballer, the source said.""Despite repeated public announcements to restrain the crowd, there was no impact. The manner in which Messi was surrounded and embraced was completely unacceptable to the World Cup-winning footballer,"" Dutta told investigators during his grilling on Friday, the source added, as cited by the PTI.West Bengal sports minister Aroop Biswas was seen close to Messi during the programme, with visuals showing him holding the footballer around the waist while posing for photographs. Biswas has been accused of using his influence to allow relatives and personal acquaintances access to Messi. Amid criticism, he resigned from his post as sports minister pending completion of the investigation.Investigators are examining how a large number of people were allowed to access the ground area.Dutta claimed that initially only 150 ground passes were issued, but the number was tripled after a ""very influential person"" arrived at the stadium and ""overpowered him"". Police are checking whether the increase in access led to the crowd control failure.""The arrested accused also claimed that once that particular influential person reached the stadium, all the flow-chart for the Messi programme got disturbed and he could not control it,"" the official told PTI.Dutta also shared financial details related to Messi’s India visit. ""Lionel Messi was paid Rs 89 crore for the tour, while Rs 11 crore was paid as tax to the Indian government,"" he told investigators, putting the total cost at Rs 100 crore. Sources said 30 per cent of the amount came from sponsors and another 30 per cent from ticket sales.SIT officers also found more than Rs 20 crore in Dutta’s frozen bank accounts. On Friday, they seized several documents during raids at his residence.""Dutta claimed that the amount in his bank account was the money which he got from selling the tickets for the Messi event in Kolkata and Hyderabad and also from the sponsors. We are verifying his claims,"" the officer said.What was supposed to be a marquee football spectacle turned into widespread violence and disorder at the stadium last week after Messi’s brief and tightly ring-fenced appearance, his first at the venue since 2011, left large sections of the crowd frustrated.They failed to catch a glimpse of their superstar despite having travelled from far and wide, paying hefty sums for tickets.The West Bengal government has formed an SIT comprising senior IPS officers Piyush Pandey, Javed Shamim, Supratim Sarkar and Muralidhar to investigate the vandalism, security lapses, access violations and the role of organisers and officials in the incident, the officer added.","Satadru Dutta, the main organiser of Lionel Messi’s event held on December 13 and now under arrest, has told investigators that the footballer was unhappy with physical contact.

A trophy with a meaning

The hollow in a million hearts

A new trophy, a new start

A forgotten memory

NEW DELHI: Looking back today, it feels almost unreal that the original FIFA World Cup trophy no longer exists.In an era where constant digital tracking and tight security were absent, football lost one of its most treasured symbols quietly and permanently. The Jules Rimet Trophy, which crowned the world champions of football for four decades, was stolen in 1983 and never recovered.The Jules Rimet Trophy was the first official World Cup prize. It was awarded to the winners of the FIFA World Cup from 1930 to 1970. Named after Jules Rimet, the former FIFA president who played a key role in starting the World Cup, the trophy carried enormous historical value.It was made of solid gold and featured a sculpted figure holding a cup, making it instantly recognisable to fans across the world.For Brazil, the trophy had special meaning.The country first won the World Cup in 1958 and defended the title in 1962. Brazil won the tournament in 1970 for the third time, completing a remarkable journey.At the time, it was under FIFA rules that any country that won the World Cup three times was allowed to keep the Jules Rimet Trophy permanently.Led by football legend Pelé, Brazil’s victory in 1970 gave the nation permanent ownership of the trophy.After the celebrations ended, the Jules Rimet Trophy was placed at the headquarters of the Brazilian Football Confederation in Rio de Janeiro.It was displayed in a glass case and treated as a symbol of Brazil’s football greatness. Security arrangements were modest, reflecting a time when the idea of stealing such an object seemed unlikely.That sense of safety did not last.In December 1983, the Jules Rimet Trophy was stolen. It all happened under the night skies when thieves broke into the CBF building. They damaged the display case and took the trophy.When officials arrived later, they found that the most famous prize in football history was gone.News of the theft reached the ears of the general public soon across Brazil and beyond. In a country where football makes people fanatics, the loss was deeply felt.The trophy was not only the representation of their success on the pitch, but it also stood for generations of players and moments that shaped the sport.Brazilian police launched an investigation immediately. Over time, several suspects were arrested, including a jeweller. Investigators worked to trace the trophy and understand the motive behind the theft. Their findings pointed to a simple but devastating conclusion. The Jules Rimet Trophy was made of solid gold, and gold could be melted.According to the investigation, the trophy was melted down and sold as gold. This conclusion was based on police evidence and statements from those involved.Once melted, the trophy lost its identity completely. No markings, shapes or features remained. Not a single piece of the original Jules Rimet Trophy has ever been recovered.This was not the first time the trophy had been stolen. In 1966, ahead of the World Cup in England, the Jules Rimet Trophy disappeared from an exhibition in London.In an interesting end to the saga, the trophy was found wrapped in newspaper under a hedge by a dog named Pickles.It was soon returned safely, and the incident became part of football folklore.The 1983 theft in Brazil had no such ending.With no hope of recovery, Brazil later commissioned a replica of the Jules Rimet Trophy. The replica was placed on display to preserve the memory of Brazil’s achievement.However, it could not replace the historical value of the original trophy that had been lifted by champions from 1930 onwards.The disappearance of the Jules Rimet Trophy also influenced how football treated its prizes.After Brazil’s third World Cup win, FIFA introduced a new trophy, first awarded in 1974. The current FIFA World Cup Trophy is not permanently awarded to any nation. Winners lift the original trophy during celebrations but are later given a replica to keep. The original remains under FIFA’s control.The loss of the Jules Rimet Trophy forced FIFA to look at this rule with a strict eye.For Brazil, the theft was especially painful.The 1970 team is widely considered one of the greatest sides in football history. Players like Pelé, Jairzinho, Rivelino and others created moments that will forever be in the memories of the fans.The trophy they earned through skill and success on the field was lost through negligence and crime.The story continues to be remembered even after decades.Authorities believe they know what happened to the trophy. Yet, the sense of loss remains because the outcome cannot be reversed.Football history was erased in physical form.Today, fans can only see photographs and replicas of the Jules Rimet Trophy. Museums display its likeness, and books recount its journey. But the original, which once travelled across continents and crowned the first world champions, no longer exists.The stolen World Cup trophy stands as a reminder of a different era. It shows how even the most valuable symbols can be lost if they are not protected. It also highlights how fragile history can be.Football has moved forward since then. New trophies have been lifted, new legends have emerged, and new memories have been created. Yet the story of the Jules Rimet Trophy remains one of the sport’s most sobering chapters.It is a throwback to a time when the World Cup could disappear. And never return.","The Jules Rimet Trophy was the first official World Cup prize. It was awarded to the winners of the FIFA World Cup from 1930 to 1970. For Brazil, the trophy had special meaning.

Engage with the Ministry as outlined above; and Constitute a joint working group comprising representatives of AIFF, Ministry and the Clubs to address legal, regulatory, and transitional matters, including timelines and approvals from AFC, FIFA, and the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India.""Representatives of all ISL clubs have been invited to attend the upcoming AIFF Annual General Meeting on Saturday, where the matter is expected to be discussed.","Indian Super League (ISL) clubs formally propose a fundamental restructuring of the country's top-tier professional football league.

At least 59 people, including seven police officers, were injured after violent clashes erupted between rival football supporters following Colombia’s Copa Colombia final in Medellin on Wednesday night, authorities said, in scenes that overshadowed Atletico Nacional’s title triumph.The unrest broke out moments after the final whistle at the Atanasio Girardot Stadium, where Atletico Nacional edged past city rivals Deportivo Independiente Medellin 1-0 to lift the trophy. What should have been a night of celebration quickly descended into chaos as fans from both sides stormed the pitch, hurled projectiles and clashed with security forces.Videos of the violence circulated widely on social media, showing dozens of supporters invading the field and confrontations breaking out in different sections of the stadium. Riot police were forced to intervene to restore order as the situation spiralled out of control in front of a crowd of around 43,000 spectators.Medellin’s security secretary Manuel Villa confirmed that 52 fans were treated for injuries sustained during the clashes, while police said seven officers were also hurt. No arrests were reported, but Villa said authorities were reviewing CCTV footage from inside and around the stadium to identify those responsible.The violence had immediate consequences for the event, with officials cancelling the post-match trophy presentation and medal ceremony for Atletico Nacional players due to safety concerns.In Colombia, visiting fans are typically barred from attending high-risk fixtures to prevent crowd trouble. However, Medellin city hall had allowed Atletico Nacional supporters — officially designated as the visiting side — to attend the final as part of an initiative to promote peaceful coexistence in football.Medellin mayor Federico Gutierrez strongly condemned the incidents, describing those involved as “criminals” and “misfits” who do not represent the sport.","At least 59 people, including seven police officers, were injured after violent clashes erupted following Colombia’s Copa Colombia final.

PARIS: Paris Saint-Germain goalkeeper Matvey Safonov has been left with a fractured hand following his penalty shootout heroics to win the Intercontinental Cup.Safonov made four straight penalty saves as PSG beat Brazil's Flamengo 2-1 in the shootout on Wednesday to secure the club's first global title. He was thrown in the air by his teammates during the celebrations.PSG said Friday that Safonov has a fracture in his left hand and that “his situation will be re-evaluated” after three or four weeks.“I can’t explain anything, it’s incredible. The player doesn’t know how it happened,” coach Luis Enrique said in translated comments Friday.He added that the most plausible explanation seemed to be that Safonov was hurt during the shootout and kept playing with the fracture.In a video posted on social media app Telegram, Safonov didn't address what happened directly, but said: “You know, no matter what happens, I can't be broken.”Safonov, PSG’s Russian backup goalkeeper, hadn’t played a single minute for the team until summer signing Lucas Chevalier sustained an ankle injury which has ruled him out since his last game Nov. 29.Chevalier was on the bench against Flamengo.

NEW DELHI: The Indian Super League (ISL) clubs were on Thursday asked to submit a proposal for forming a consortium to run the 2025-26 season of the league, which is yet to begin.Representatives of all ISL clubs were invited to attend the Annual General Meeting of the All India Football Federation on Saturday, on the sidelines of which the matter was discussed.“Regarding the consortium thing, the clubs have been told to submit to the ministry their proposal so that it can be discussed during the Dec 20 AGM. But there is no guarantee,” a club representative told news agency PTI.The request followed a virtual meeting on Thursday between AIFF officials, ISL club representatives and the sports ministry. The clubs were asked to submit their proposal by Friday evening.The AIFF also informed the clubs that, under its new constitution, any amendment to its provisions could be done only after the General Body of the national federation was formed according to the new constitution itself.“It could be hotchpotch also since the new National Sports Grievance Act is likely to be implemented shortly. So there can be changes under the Act also,” a source in the know of things said.Meanwhile, the Indian Women’s League, starting December 20, will be held without a sponsor after the AIFF and Capri Sports – the lone bidder in the national federation’s tender to monetise the commercial rights of the first and second divisions of the IWL for five years – could not reach an agreement.The clubs had earlier suggested forming a consortium to resolve the ongoing commercial impasse in Indian football.The AIFF said this would require deliberations and approval by its Executive Committee and the AGM.The Marketing Rights Agreement between the AIFF and Football Sports Development Limited, which organised the ISL for 12 seasons since its inception in 2014, ended on December 8, leaving the top-tier league without a commercial framework.","Indian Super League (ISL) clubs were on Thursday asked to submit a proposal for forming a consortium to run the 2025-26 season of the league, which is yet to begin.

NEW DELHI: Today is December 18. For some, it is just another day on the way to Christmas and the New Year. For football fans, however, it is a date that will forever live in the sport’s collective memory as the night Lionel Messi completed the game.Under the bright lights of Lusail Stadium in Qatar three years back, Argentina defeated France in a final that felt less like a match and more like destiny unfolding in real time.For Messi, it was not just a World Cup title; it was the closing chapter of a lifelong pursuit that had defined his career, his country, and an entire generation of football fans.For nearly two decades, Messi’s greatness had been measured against an absence.He had won everything at club level, from Champions League to multiple Ballon d’Ors, league titles and goal-scoring records that once seemed untouchable.And yet, the World Cup remained the one prize that eluded him, the yardstick by which football immortality is often judged.In Argentina, where Diego Maradona ’s shadow still loomed large, that absence was felt more sharply than anywhere else.Qatar 2022 began with doubt rather than certainty. Argentina’s shocking opening defeat to Saudi Arabia threatened to derail the campaign before it truly began.For a brief moment, old fears resurfaced: was this another World Cup destined to end in heartbreak for Messi?But what followed was a team and a captain refusing to surrender to narrative or pressure.Messi led with calm authority. He scored, he created, he inspired, and, perhaps most importantly, he believed.From the group stages to the knockout rounds, Argentina grew stronger with each game, feeding off Messi’s composure and clarity. Against Australia, the Netherlands, and Croatia, he was not just a playmaker but the emotional compass of the side, guiding younger teammates through moments of chaos and tension.Then came the final: Argentina versus France, Messi versus Kylian Mbappé, experience versus explosive youth. It was billed as a passing-of-the-torch moment, but Messi was not ready to hand anything over.He scored from the penalty spot to give Argentina the lead and later added a second, arriving in the box with perfect timing to finish off a flowing move. At 2–0, it seemed as though the dream was finally within reach.Football, however, rarely allows fairy tales to unfold without resistance. In a breathtaking twist, Mbappé struck twice in the space of minutes to drag France back into the contest.Extra time followed, and Messi once again stepped up, poking the ball home to make it 3–2. Still, France refused to yield. Mbappé completed his hat-trick from the penalty spot, forcing a shootout that felt almost unbearable in its tension.As penalties loomed, the weight of history hung heavy. Argentina had been here before. It was close, but not close enough. This time, though, the script was different.Emiliano Martínez produced heroics in goal, Argentine penalties were struck with conviction, and when Gonzalo Montiel converted the decisive kick, Messi dropped to his knees, overcome with emotion.Tears flowed freely.Teammates swarmed him. In that moment, the burden he had carried for so long seemed to lift. The image of Messi, draped in the black bisht as he raised the World Cup trophy, became instantly iconic.For Argentina, the victory healed old wounds. It united generations that had debated Messi’s place in the pantheon and finally allowed him to be celebrated without caveats.For Messi himself, it was redemption, validation, and closure all at once.He had not just won a World Cup; he had done so as the undisputed leader of the team, delivering when it mattered most.Two years on, the significance of that night has only grown.December 18 is no longer just a date on the football calendar. It is the day Lionel Messi stepped beyond comparison, beyond debate, and into footballing eternity; World Cup in hand, legacy complete.","Lionel Messi won the FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022 trophy on December 18, 2013.

Travis Hunter did not need shoulder pads or a helmet to steal attention on Sunday. Even from the sidelines, the Jaguars rookie managed to turn a road trip into a moment that fans will remember long after the final whistle. His presence in Denver carried weight, not because of snaps played, but because of what he represents to both Jacksonville and Colorado football.Travis Hunter returned to a place that once celebrated his rise, now wearing different colors and embracing a new chapter. With his rookie season cut short by knee surgery, the two-way standout found another way to stay involved. He showed that connection to the game does not vanish when injuries intervene. It simply takes a different shape.From a VIP suite at Mile High Stadium, Hunter soaked in every second as the Jaguars stunned the Broncos. While frustration boiled over in the stands, his reaction told a different story. He laughed, clapped, and leaned into the chaos, clearly enjoying the reversal of roles. The former Buffaloes star became a viral sensation for playfully taunting Broncos fans, reminding everyone that confidence does not fade when the cleats come off.The scene was striking. Broncos supporters were locked in heated debates with referees, arms raised and voices loud. Replays sparked anger. His celebration felt genuine, almost therapeutic, for a player forced to watch rather than contribute on the field.He delivered flashes of brilliance early, including a breakout performance with over 100 receiving yards and his first NFL touchdown. Then came the setback. A non contact knee injury during practice ended his season abruptly, forcing patience and reflection.Still, Hunter has not disappeared. He continues to show up as a teammate, a supporter, and now a proud father alongside his wife Leanna and their newborn son. Their presence in Denver added another layer to the story, blending football, family, and resilience into one frame.For Jacksonville, the win reinforced belief. Sitting atop the AFC South at 11 and 4, the Jaguars showed they can rise in big moments. For Hunter, the night offered proof that impact is not always measured in yards or tackles. Sometimes it lives in energy, perspective, and a well timed smile on enemy turf.Also Read: Josh Allen injury update: Bills QB skips practice, yet reassures Bills fans he’ll start against Eagles in crucial Week 17 clash","Travis Hunter returned to a place that once celebrated his rise, now wearing different colors and embracing a new chapter.

Josh Allen signals confidence ahead of Eagles clash



The Buffalo Bills left Cleveland with more than just another win in the standings. They left with questions, tension, and a brief moment of concern when Josh Allen disappeared down the tunnel with a foot injury. In a season shaped by thin margins, that scene lingered longer than the final score. For a franchise chasing something bigger, every step its quarterback takes matters, especially now.Back home in Buffalo, the focus quickly shifted to what comes next. A heavyweight matchup against the defending champion Philadelphia Eagles awaits, and all eyes are on Josh Allen. His health is not just a line on an injury report. It is the pulse of a team that believes this season has a different ending written into it.Josh Allen wasted little time easing nerves. Speaking after the walkthrough, his message was clear and direct. “Feels good. Feels good. I’m ready to go,” said Allen, per Joe Buscaglia of The Athletic on X, formerly Twitter. The confidence in his voice carried weight, especially after he was limited earlier in the week.Buscaglia later added context to the situation, reporting, “Bills QB Josh Allen said he plans on playing Sunday vs the Eagles, despite not partaking in Tuesday’s walkthrough due to a foot injury.”The absence was precautionary, not alarming. With the practice schedule adjusted because of Christmas, head coach Sean McDermott emphasized caution rather than concern.When asked directly about Allen’s availability, McDermott offered reassurance. “As far as I’m aware, yes,” he said when questioned about Allen playing on Sunday. He acknowledged the soreness but framed it as manageable. “No real changes, today was just a chance to get around him a little and see how he’s feeling,” McDermott explained. “He’s still a little sore, so he’s not going to practice today and we’ll see how tomorrow goes. ”Allen echoed that steady tone later. “Feels good, ready to go,” he said. “Still sore, walk through today so really not a practice, but feeling good. Yes, planning on playing.”The timing matters. Philadelphia brings a defense built to disrupt rhythm and punish mistakes. Buffalo will need Allen sharp, decisive, and confident, especially with no practice squad quarterback available after Shane Buechele’s departure. The margin for error feels slim, but so does the opportunity.With kickoff set for Sunday afternoon in Buffalo, the message from the Bills’ locker room is steady belief. Josh Allen plans to be there, foot soreness and all, ready to lead a team that senses its moment may finally be within reach.Also Read: Nikki Bella fuels Cooper DeJean romance rumors after fiery Eagles hype moment during viral WWE appearance",Buffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen missed Tuesday's walkthrough with a foot injury.

Nikki Bella Cooper DeJean romance rumors grow louder after RAW moment



Nikki Bella Cooper DeJean romance rumors found fresh oxygen this week, not from a gossip blog but inside a roaring wrestling arena. In Grand Rapids, Michigan, Bella walked into enemy territory and did what she has always done best. She owned the moment. The WWE Hall of Famer did not just play to the crowd. She provoked it. And in doing so, she turned a routine “Monday Night RAW” appearance into a viral crossover moment blending sports, spectacle, and curiosity about her personal life.Bella, 42, leaned fully into her heel persona while hyping the Philadelphia Eagles, the reigning Super Bowl champions, in front of Lions fans already riding emotional lows. Her timing was sharp. Days earlier, she had been spotted at Lincoln Financial Field, posing near Eagles cornerback Cooper DeJean’s locker. The internet connected dots quickly. Bella did not confirm anything, but she also did not hide from the noise.“I am a legend, I am a Hall of Famer and I am a former champion, and this is what champions look like, do you got that?” Bella told the crowd. “But you know what, I mean, how would you people know what champions look like? I mean, you root for the Lions.Let’s be honest, the Lions wish they were as good as the Philadelphia Eagles, am I right? Oh, wait, better yet, Ohio State.”The boos were instant and loud. Michigan fans had reasons to bristle. The Lions, despite back to back NFC North titles, sit at 8-7 with playoff hopes fading after a painful loss to the Steelers. College football has been no kinder. Michigan is still reeling from the stunning firing of head coach Sherrone Moore amid a scandal that shocked the program. Bella pressed where it hurt, and she knew it.The intrigue around Nikki Bella Cooper DeJean romance rumors only intensified after the show. DeJean, 22, was named to his first Pro Bowl, a milestone season for the Eagles rookie. Bella reacted warmly to the team’s official announcement online, a small gesture that fans dissected instantly. DeJean, for his part, seems unfazed by the spotlight. After intercepting a pass against Washington, he celebrated with a WWE-style dance alongside teammate Quinyon Mitchell, feeding the crossover narrative even more.Still, Bella has tried to slow the speculation. On “The Nikki & Brie Show,” she offered a candid, almost disarming comment that cut through the fantasy. “I haven’t even kissed someone in so long. It’s, like, kind of crazy. I was thinking of this last night. Do I know how to kiss?”Bella’s life has shifted in recent years. She finalized her divorce from former “Dancing with the Stars” partner Artem Chigvintsev earlier this year. The two share a five-year-old son, Matteo. She also returned to WWE action at the women’s Royal Rumble, signaling that her story in wrestling is far from finished.Whether romance is real or rumored, Nikki Bella understands one truth better than most. Attention follows authenticity. And right now, she has both the wrestling world and the NFL watching her next move.Also Read: Paul Rudd joins outrage over Travis Kelce’s disallowed TD, calling out NFL officiating after controversial Chiefs call","WWE Hall of Famer Nikki Bella turned a routine appearance into a viral crossover moment.

Paul Rudd calls out NFL refs after Travis Kelce loses touchdown in call that stuns Chiefs fans

Paul Rudd on Why Jack Black is The Best, Worst Auditions, Chiefs Fandom & Naming Your Nuts | EP 171

Hollywood voices do not often cut through NFL noise, but Paul Rudd managed to do exactly that. Appearing on Jason and Travis Kelce ’s New Heights podcast, the lifelong Kansas City Chiefs fan spoke with the mix of loyalty and frustration many supporters feel right now. The Chiefs’ season unraveled faster than expected, and Travis Kelce became a symbol of those missed chances.For Travis Kelce, the frustration went beyond the scoreboard. Injuries, timing issues, and officiating decisions all seemed to collide at once. Rudd acknowledged how thin the margins can be in the NFL, especially when momentum turns on a single flag. That reality hit hardest during the controversial Colts game, a moment that still sparks debate weeks later.Paul Rudd did not hide his disbelief while revisiting the now infamous face mask penalty that erased a Travis Kelce touchdown against Indianapolis. The play looked clean to many watching live, and replays only intensified the backlash. Rudd tried to put the moment into perspective while still capturing the sting it left behind.“I mean, it’s a great team, and you know, you guys, it’s tough. It’s a tough thing to sustain.And sometimes, something goes your way. Sometimes you score a touchdown, and they call a phantom face mask. There’s lots of things that happen, and it happens to every team, not just, you know, but it’s a game of inches,” Paul Rudd said.That single call shifted energy on the field and among fans. Even CBS analyst Tony Romo later called it “ridiculous,” arguing that the contact was minimal and should never have drawn a flag. Moments like that fuel the belief that officiating lacks consistency, even if critics admit the Chiefs have benefited from favorable calls in the past.Rudd also chose to look ahead rather than dwell on anger. He spoke about the toll this era of constant deep playoff runs has taken on players, especially veterans. The Chiefs have played what feels like an extra season compared to most teams, year after year.“I’m excited for some of the players to get maybe a little bit of a summer vacation. I mean, my God. It’s like you played an extra season of football compared to everyone else. And so I’m like, ‘Oh good, you get a break, a chance to kind of rest up. I’m not too upset,” Paul Rudd said.As Kansas City turns the page, uncertainty surrounds Travis Kelce’s future, with retirement rumors growing louder. Whether he returns or not, this season will be remembered as a reminder of how quickly fortunes can change, and how one call can echo long after the final whistle.Also Read: Chaos in Kansas City as Chiefs set woeful streak, stars shout at teammates in humiliating Titans blowout","Paul Rudd appeared on Jason and Travis Kelce’s New Heights podcast.

NFL fans stunned as ex-Eagles player Laekin Vakalahi sells Super Bowl ring for $124K less than a year after title win,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/nfl-fans-stunned-as-ex-eagles-player-laekin-vakalahi-sells-super-bowl-ring-for-124k-less-than-a-year-after-title-win/articleshow/126150144.cms,"A former Eagles offensive lineman, Laekin Vakalahi, sold his Super Bowl LIX ring for over $124,000, sparking debate about NFL careers. Despite never playing a down, Vakalahi was entitled to the championship symbol. His decision highlights the financial realities for fringe players, where monetary gain can supersede sentimental value, revealing the league's harsh business side.

Why Laekin Vakalahi’s ring sale highlights the harsh business side of NFL glory

For most NFL players, a Super Bowl ring is a lifetime keepsake, a symbol of sacrifice, timing, and survival in the league’s most brutal ecosystem. For Laekin Vakalahi, that symbol became something else entirely.Less than a year after the Philadelphia Eagles’ dominant Super Bowl LIX victory over the Kansas City Chiefs, the former offensive lineman quietly let go of his ring, turning it into a six-figure payday that has sparked debate across football circles. The sale offers a revealing look at how fleeting NFL careers can be, especially for fringe roster players navigating opportunity, uncertainty, and financial reality.Vakalahi’s Super Bowl ring sold for $124,440 at Heritage Auctions, making it the first championship ring from the Eagles’ 2025 title team to reach the open market. The sale was confirmed by Darren Rovell, who wrote:“First Super Bowl LIX player ring to come to market sold last night at @HeritageAuction for $124,440. It was the ring of OT Laekin Vakalahi. He did not play a single down for the team.”While the number raised eyebrows, the context matters. Vakalahi entered the NFL through the league’s International Pathway Program after transitioning from rugby, earning a practice squad role rather than a guaranteed roster spot.Though he never played in a regular-season or playoff game, league rules still entitled him to a ring, a perk of being part of the championship organization.The ring itself is a collector’s dream, loaded with diamonds that reference historic playoff scoring, Super Bowl dominance, and the Eagles’ record-setting rushing attack. Yet for Vakalahi, the ring may have represented potential value rather than sentiment.Waived during final roster cuts months later and still searching for his next NFL opportunity, Vakalahi’s decision underscores a rarely discussed truth: for players on the margins, financial stability can outweigh nostalgia. In that sense, the ring didn’t lose its meaning, it simply took on a different one.","Former Eagles offensive lineman Laekin Vakalahi sold his Super Bowl LIX ring for over $124,000.

Celebrated designer Sarah Burton is rumored to be creating the dress, chosen for her ability to balance strength and elegance. Swift views the gown as a deliberate storytelling element, connecting her past eras to her present happiness.

Taylor Swift’s wedding gown may carry subtle tributes to Travis Kelce and her evolving life

Ever since Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce confirmed their engagement, attention has naturally turned to their upcoming wedding and more specifically, what Swift will wear on the big day. Known for weaving meaning into every creative choice, Swift is reportedly treating her wedding dress as more than just a fashion statement.Sources suggest the gown will be deeply symbolic, blending tradition, personal history, and a clear nod to the future she’s building with Kelce, all while staying unmistakably “Taylor.”According to reports, Swift has tapped celebrated designer Sarah Burton to create the dress, a choice that signals intention rather than trend-chasing. Insiders say Swift views the gown as part of a larger narrative, one that connects her past eras to her present happiness.As one source explained, “Her choice of gown will set bridal trends for years to come. Taylor knows this and sees the dress as part of the story she’s telling. She’s being deliberate. She wants a design that respects her past but also captures her life with Travis – it’s a hugely significant moment for both of them, and Taylor is intent on that being seen in her gown choice.”Burton’s reputation for balancing strength with elegance reportedly plays a major role in Swift’s decision. Another insider shared, “Sarah has a way of blending elegance with strength – which is why she’s the leading contender.” The symbolism matters to Swift, especially given Burton’s history of designing gowns viewed by a global audience. As one source noted, “Burton designed a gown witnessed by a global audience, and Taylor knows her own wedding will carry that same kind of worldwide attention. “Swift herself has hinted that marriage wasn’t always something she imagined in detail. She previously said, “You would think that I had been the type of person who would have obsessed over the idea of a wedding my whole life, but I actually never thought about what I would ever do or what I would want until I met the person.”While details about the ceremony remain closely guarded, one thing feels certain, Swift’s wedding gown won’t just be memorable for its beauty, but for the story it quietly tells.Also Read: Did Taylor Swift quietly acknowledge Blake Lively’s birthday message while planning her fairytale wedding with Travis Kelce?","Celebrated designer Sarah Burton is rumored to be creating the dress.

Cardi B’s $125,000 Birkin moment mattered more than her trash talk

Cardi B knows how to make an entrance and her recent appearance at the New England Patriots’ comeback win over the Baltimore Ravens was no exception. While fans were focused on the final score and Stefon Diggs’ performance, the rapper brought her own kind of energy to the stadium. From her bold outfit to her outspoken support from the stands, Cardi made the night feel more like a pop culture moment than just another NFL game.Dressed in a full-length mink fur coat and platinum-blonde hair, Cardi B became an instant focal point inside the stadium, especially when she was caught telling Ravens fans to “enjoy their trip to Cancun.” The moment turned even more surreal with Patriots owner Robert Kraft and Jonathan Kraft visibly seated behind her, appearing eager to stay out of the spotlight as Cardi leaned fully into the rivalry.But beyond the trash talk and viral clips, fashion insiders were locked onto a far subtler flex. Fans quickly identified the accessory that truly stole the show: an “extremely rare” vintage Hermès Jean Paul Gaultier Birkin shoulder bag. The piece, reportedly created in 2004 when Gaultier briefly took over as Hermès’ creative director, is known for its unconventional half-cut design, making it a unicorn among collectors.Online reactions exploded once the price surfaced. “Bought for $125,000.” became the line that stopped fashion timelines cold, reframing the entire look as more museum-worthy than game-day glam. The green Birkin, allegedly flown in specifically for the appearance, elevated the moment from celebrity sideline cameo to cultural statement.After the final whistle, Cardi and Diggs celebrated with his mother. While the Patriots fought for playoff life, Cardi B casually reminded the world that her presence alone can turn a football game into a fashion headline and a luxury history lesson at the same time.Also Read: Stefon Diggs’ beau Cardi B becomes one of the highest-paid OnlyFans creators with a reported $9 million per month","Cardi B turned a New England Patriots game into a fashion spectacle with her $125,000 vintage Hermès Birkin bag.

Sources say he was informed in advance and is focused on staying drama-free for the sake of their children. Rather than resentment, Brady is prioritizing co-parenting, emotional growth, and ensuring his kids’ happiness during the holiday season.

Tom Brady’s reaction to Gisele Bündchen’s marriage reflects a shift toward peace and co-parenting

Gisele Bündchen’s recent marriage to Joaquim Valente has reopened public curiosity about her post-divorce dynamic with Tom Brady. Although she managed to keep her December 3 wedding to Valente mostly under wraps, fans were still eager to know how Tom Brady reacted to the news.According to sources, Brady knew about the marriage ahead of time and has reportedly been calm and respectful. Bündchen and Brady finalized their divorce three years ago after 13 years of marriage. Valante, Bündchen’s jiu-jitsu instructor, began dating her in June 2023, just months after her divorce was finalized.According to sources, Brady was informed about Bündchen’s wedding plans ahead of time, signaling a functional line of communication between the former spouses. As one insider explained to Daily Mail, “It wasn't a secret to him. They still have to talk because of the kids, and though that is often very brief, important milestones, schedules and of course her getting married was something she wasn't going to keep secret. ”Rather than internalizing the moment as a loss, Brady is said to be reframing it as part of life’s natural progression. A source described his mindset clearly: “""He's happy in the way that is simple: he's happy that she is happy.Down the line he might get married again and he would want her to be OK with that, so he has to be OK about it.”The insider further added, “If he was upset, that would mean he still has feelings for her and that it would be unfair to the kids if he didn't want to see their mom happy and move on. He's had to move on from two different important relationships, and two mothers to his children. He's learned a lot along the way, and he's taking this next stage in stride. He's being very mature about it and not letting it pick at him negatively in any way. ”As another source summed it up, “It's life, and everyone is happy,” adding that Brady is intentionally avoiding drama. For him, the equation is simple: separate lives, shared responsibility, and children whose “safety and happiness… is everything.”Also Read: “Didn’t want anything over the top”: Insiders reveal why Gisele Bündchen opted for a quiet wedding with Joaquim Valente",Tom Brady and Gisele Bündchen finalized their divorce three years ago after 13 years of marriage.

How much does Dak Prescott make?

What does Sarah Jane Ramos do for a living?

Also Read:

Dak Prescott, who plays quarterback for the Dallas Cowboys, is one of the NFL's highest-paid players. Sarah Jane Ramos, his fiancée, works in a completely different field. As the couple keeps making headlines both on and off the field, more and more people are asking the same question: how much money do they have?They can make quite different amounts of money, but their financial experiences illustrate two very different methods to get ahead.Several companies that keep track of people's money believe that Dak Prescott will be worth about $90 million in 2025. His NFL contracts give him most of that money. In 2024, Prescott signed a big four-year, $240 million deal with the Dallas Cowboys. There is a $80 million signing bonus and more than $200 million in guarantees in the deal. That deal puts him among the highest-paid quarterbacks in the league's history.Prescott makes millions of dollars a year from endorsements in addition to his wage. He makes deals with well-known brands including Jordan Brand, AT&T, Beats by Dre, and Pepsi.

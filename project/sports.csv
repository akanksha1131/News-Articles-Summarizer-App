Shubman Gill Press Conference: Team India captain opens up about India’s bowling plan for SA Test

KOLKATA: It is not often that a champion team starts off in a game as underdogs. When World Test champions South Africa take on India in the first Test of the two-match series at the Eden Gardens here from Friday, they will surely not be the favourites. That’s a tag reserved for India when they are playing at home, even if on a wicket that might provide more help to seamers than anywhere else in the country.“It’s a typical Indian wicket,” India skipper Shubman Gill said on Thursday, after checking the all-important rectangle for the millionth time over three days. “Today, it looked a bit different from how it was yesterday,” he added.Now, that’s interesting. These variations might just make the team combination pendulum oscillate between spin and pace. “It tends to swing in the morning and evening in Kolkata,” Gill said. Statistics say pacers picked 75 per cent of wickets in the last four Tests. So, Kuldeep or Akash Deep?But then, in India, spin dominates eventually. Maybe, play safe and go for Axar Patel and thus have an extra batter. After all, South Africa too have some dangerous weapons in their bowling armoury.“We’ll wait for another look tomorrow morning before deciding our playing XI,” Gill concluded.South Africa skipper Temba Bavuma would also wait for Friday before declaring his team. “Here in Kolkata, it swings a bit more than other parts of India, but then this is the subcontinent and you have to make sure that you have your resources from the spin point of view,” he said. “So, we’ll wait one more day.” India’s dilemma is quite understandable, given the debacle against New Zealand. Dishing out turners went against them as even a not-so-established spinner like Ajaz Patel ended up looking menacing. Sometimes, the demon you bank on can turn back and devour you. If Gill, Gautam Gambhir (head coach) and Sitanshu Kotak (batting coach) were repeatedly going back to check the pitch, holding discussions with the curators, they were perhaps trying to figure out if indeed there were any hidden demons.“No demons out there,” South Africa coach Shukri Conrad declared after inspecting the pitch. “Just a normal Eden Gardens wicket.” His bowlers did get some swing towards the fag end of an afternoon practice session. That would be around 4 pm, when the light starts fading. Reverse swing would be a major factor too, as Gill admitted. The team managements will have to keep all permutations in mind before settling down on their playing XI.Thursday’s net session was a lot about batting. Rishabh Pant had a lengthy session, both against pace and spin. So did Gill and KL Rahul. The skipper took Kuldeep and Axar, along with two local spinners for another net. Gambhir soon joined, speaking to Kuldeep and Axar separately. It might well be a toss-up between these two if the combination pendulum veers towards spin.South Africa too have their batting in place, the dependable Bavuma, fluent Ryan Rickleton, elegant Tony de Zorzi and gritty Aiden Markram all spent some quality time in the nets on Thursday. This batting lineup is way stronger than that of the West Indies, India’s last Test opponents, whom they dominated over two Tests. The only worry for Gill’s team in that series was that they allowed the second Test to go to Day 5. “It was a slow wicket (in Delhi) and our spinners were not getting the zip,” Gill said. In hindsight, he admitted enforcing the follow-on was unfair on the tired bowlers and might have stretched the game. Eden would be a lot faster, with zip for spinners and swing for pacers.Test matches always have battles within the war: Jasprit Bumrah vs Bavuma; Kagiso Rabada vs Gill; Mohammed Siraj vs Rickleton or maybe Keshav Maharaj vs Rahul. A lot of interesting battles could be played out there over the next five days, making it a lively contest.","South Africa take on India in the first Test of the two-match series at the Eden Gardens here from Friday. “It’s a typical Indian wicket,” India skipper Shubman Gill said on Thursday, after checking the all-important rectangle.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125315066,imgsize-1006771,width-400,resizemode-4/shubman-gill-and-temba-bavuma.jpg"

SA20, South Africa’s premier T20 league, held ‘SA20 India Day 2025’ event in Mumbai. The event marked a milestone for the league ahead of its fourth season, scheduled from December 26, 2025, to January 25, 2026.The event, hosted at the Museum of Solutions (MuSo), was attended by League Commissioner Graeme Smith, South African cricketers and coaches including Faf du Plessis (Joburg Super Kings), David Miller (Paarl Royals), Tom Moody (Durban’s Super Giants), Hashim Amla (MI Cape Town), and Mark Boucher. Tristan Stubbs, Adrian Birrell, and Sourav Ganguly also joined through video messages. Representatives of SA20 franchises were also present.Over its first three seasons, SA20 has emerged as one of the largest T20 leagues outside India. It features international players such as Kane Williamson, Joe Root, Jos Buttler, Sunil Narine, Andre Russell, and Trent Boult, along with South African players Dewald Brevis, Tristan Stubbs, Kwena Maphaka, and Ryan Rickelton.Season 3 saw a 70% increase in sold-out matches, including a third consecutive full-house final, and a 37% rise in global TV viewership across India, the UK, the US, and Africa.Addressing the event, Graeme Smith said: “India has been at the heart of SA20’s journey from the start. The support of the IPL-owned teams and our partnership with JioStar has been vital. The passion and energy of Indian fans inspire us every season, and their connection has played a huge role in the league’s growth. As we head into Season 4, we’re excited to strengthen that bond and continue delivering a league that resonates across South Africa and the subcontinent. ”Meanwhile former Proteas captain Faf du Plessis remarked: “As players, we can feel the buzz around SA20 — not just back home, but here in India too. It’s one of the best T20 leagues in the world — competitive, entertaining, and truly global. Seeing fans in India follow the matches, know the franchises, and connect with our teams is really special. It speaks volumes about what this league has built in such a short time.”David Miller said: “SA20 has become a league fans can genuinely call their own. Whether you’re in Cape Town, Johannesburg, or Mumbai, you see people cheering for their teams, sharing highlights, and engaging with players. That connection with the fans is the league’s biggest win — it’s what makes cricket a true celebration between nations.”Tom Moody, Global Director of Cricket for Durban’s Super Giants said: “SA20 has truly transformed into a league that connects players, fans, and franchises across borders. Every season, the quality of cricket continues to rise, and so does the passion surrounding it. What makes SA20 special is its ability to bring together South Africa’s homegrown spirit with the global cricket community — and the growing support from India is adding even more energy to that story. ”Hashim Amla said: “Beyond the excitement and fandom, SA20 is also about creating pathways, for young players to learn, adapt, and compete at the highest level. The quality of cricket and exposure this platform provides is phenomenal. You can already see how it’s shaping the next generation of South African talent. The League has truly become a bridge between grassroots potential and global stardom.”Mark Boucher said: “Indian and South African cricket have always shared a special bond; of respect, rivalry, and a deep love for the game. SA20 carries that spirit forward, uniting the two cultures to create something truly special.”","South Africa’s premier T20 league, held ‘SA20 India Day 2025’ event in Mumbai.

Islamabad Court SHAKES After Suicide Car Explosion; Attack Day After Blast In India’s Capital

Poll Should the ICC implement stricter penalties for slow over-rates? Yes, absolutely No, the current rules are sufficient

Days after a suicide bombing in Islamabad triggered security concerns and forced a reshuffle in the schedule of the ongoing Pakistan–Sri Lanka ODI series, hosts Pakistan have been fined for an incident pertaining to the first match at Rawalpindi.The International Cricket Council (ICC) announced on Thursday that Pakistan were penalised 20 per cent of their match fee for a slow over-rate, falling four overs short of the target during the opening ODI, which they won by six runs. The sanction was imposed by Ali Naqvi, of the Emirates ICC Panel of Match Referees, after time allowances were taken into account.On-field umpires Alex Wharf and Asif Yaqoob, third umpire Sharfuddoula Ibne Shahid, and fourth umpire Rashid Riaz levelled the charge. Pakistan captain Shaheen Afridi accepted the proposed penalty, negating the need for a formal hearing.Under Article 2.22 of the ICC Code of Conduct for Players and Player Support Personnel, teams are fined five per cent of their match fee for every over they fail to complete within the allotted time.The penalty comes amid heightened tension around the series following Tuesday’s blast in Islamabad that killed 12 and injured 27.Several Sri Lankan players reportedly raised concerns and discussed returning home, prompting Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) to issue a directive ordering the team to stay and complete the tour.“If any player, players, or member of the support staff return despite SLC's directives, a formal review will be conducted... and an appropriate decision will be made,” the board said in a statement.In response to the incident, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) rescheduled the remaining ODIs, with the second now to be played on Friday and the third on Sunday, and reinforced security around both teams.Pakistan lead the three-match series 1-0 after their narrow victory in the opener, which featured Salman Ali Agha’s unbeaten 105 and a spirited effort from Wanindu Hasaranga, whose 59 went in vain.The tour will continue with the second ODI in Rawalpindi under tight security arrangements.",Pakistan were fined 20 per cent of their match fee for a slow over-rate.

Poll Should the ISL, I-League, and I-League 2 be managed under one commercial framework? Yes, it will promote parity No, each league should have its own management

Amid the ongoing turmoil in Indian football, Union Sports Minister Mansukh Mandaviya met representatives of I-League clubs in New Delhi on Thursday to discuss their concerns and explore possible solutions to the escalating standoff between the All India Football Federation (AIFF), the Indian Super League (ISL), and I-League teams.The meeting, attended by seven representatives from among the 14 I-League clubs, was also joined by Sports Secretary and SAI Director General Hari Ranjan Rao and Joint Secretary Kunal. According to a senior official present, Mandaviya “gave a patient hearing to the I-League representatives” and urged the Sports Authority of India to mediate discussions going forward for the time being.“The minister gave a patient hearing to the I-League representatives and for the time being instructed SAI to step in and engage with the stakeholders.He wants a constructive dialogue between officials of the AIFF, the Indian Super League (ISL) and I-League,” a source told PTI.The intervention from the ministry comes a day after I-League clubs boycotted a meeting convened by the AIFF to address the deepening crisis triggered by the federation’s inability to secure a new commercial partner.The fallout of the AIFF’s failed renewal with Football Sports Development Limited (FSDL), which had managed the ISL and related commercial activities, has left domestic football in uncertainty.With the partnership collapsing ahead of its December expiry, the 2025–26 ISL season remains on hold, and top I-League clubs, including defending champions Mohun Bagan, have suspended training sessions.The I-League clubs have demanded that all tiers of Indian football, namely the ISL, I-League, and I-League 2 be managed under a single commercial framework to ensure parity and stability.The AIFF’s search for a new partner is being monitored by the Supreme Court, which approved a revised constitution for the federation in October.The ministry is expected to facilitate further discussions between the AIFF, ISL and I-League representatives in the coming days to help break the deadlock.","Union Sports Minister Mansukh Mandaviya met representatives of I-League clubs in New Delhi on Thursday.

Poll Should Oscar consider retiring to prioritize his health? Yes, absolutely No, he should continue playing if possible

Former Chelsea and Brazil midfielder Oscar was taken to hospital after suffering a heart-related issue during a pre-season training session with São Paulo. The club confirmed that the 34-year-old is in stable condition and under medical observation.According to reports in Brazil, the incident occurred during fitness tests on an exercise bike when Oscar collapsed and briefly lost consciousness. He was attended to immediately by medical staff before being transported to hospital in an ambulance.São Paulo released an official statement confirming the episode and the player’s current status. “During tests carried out on Tuesday morning, at SuperCT, as part of pre-season preparation, athlete Oscar presented a complication with cardiac changes, and was promptly treated by the club's professionals and the medical team from Einstein Hospital Israelita, who were present at the scene,” the club said.It further added: “The player was then taken to the hospital, where he is clinically stable and remains under observation for further tests to clarify the diagnosis.”Oscar, who returned to his boyhood club São Paulo on a free transfer last December, has a contract with the team until 2027. He had spent several years playing in China before his return to Brazil.The midfielder was a key figure at Chelsea between 2012 and 2017, winning two Premier League titles and a Europa League crown during his time in England.He left the London club midway through the 2016–17 season to join Shanghai for a reported $73 million fee, becoming one of the highest-paid players in the Chinese Super League.Oscar also represented Brazil at the 2014 FIFA World Cup, playing alongside Neymar Jr, scoring the team’s only goal in the 7–1 semifinal thrashing to eventual champions Germany.Further medical updates on his condition are expected as São Paulo continue to monitor the midfielder closely.There are also reports that the player is considering retirement after his condition came to light.

Portuguese superstar Cristiano Ronaldo has urged Ireland fans to boo him when Portugal take the field in Thursday’s World Cup qualifier in Dublin. Speaking at a press conference on Wednesday, the 40-year-old said he hoped the home supporters’ focus on him might ease the pressure on his teammates as Portugal look to secure qualification for the 2026 World Cup.“The stadium will boo me, I’m used to it, I certainly hope they do — maybe it will take the pressure off other players,” Ronaldo told reporters in Dublin. Portugal sit five points clear at the top of Group F with two games left, and a win over Ireland would seal their spot in next year’s World Cup. Ronaldo, who is aiming to feature in his sixth edition of the tournament, said he expects a tough contest against an Irish side that will likely defend deep.“It will be a difficult match,” he said. “Ireland will sit back and make it hard for us to find space.”The Al Nassr forward was also asked about the possibility of scoring his 1000th career goal in the World Cup final, which he dismissed with a laugh. “You’ve been watching too many movies, that would be too perfect,” Ronaldo joked. “It’s always good to score goals — that’s my job. I want to play in this next World Cup, otherwise I wouldn’t be here, but let’s take it step by step.”Ronaldo has scored 953 career goals and holds the record for the most goals in men’s international football with 143. While he hinted earlier this week that the 2026 World Cup could be his last, Ronaldo chose not to dwell on his future this time.“There’s no point in being repetitive and losing focus,” he said. “Maybe later I’ll speak more clearly about what I think for the future, but right now, the goal is qualification.”","Cristiano Ronaldo has urged Ireland fans to boo him when Portugal take the field in Thursday's World Cup qualifier in Dublin.

It was a busy day at the Football House in New Delhi as the All India Football Federation (AIFF) convened back-to-back meetings with multiple stakeholders in order to address the current predicament facing Indian football.AIFF called for interactions on short notice with Executive Committee members, Indian Super League (ISL) captains, club CEOs and I-League owners on Wednesday (November 12). ISL clubs and captains - except that of Mohun Bagan Super Giant and East Bengal - explored the possibility of putting in all their resources to make the top-tier tournament happen.Eight I-League clubs, meanwhile, stayed away from the meeting and are due to meet Sports Minister Mansukh Mandaviya on Thursday.“Keeping in mind the fundamental importance of a multi- tier league National structure for the development of the football in the country (Tier 1-2-3), we suggest that all the three leagues in this case ISL, I League and I League-2 should be managed by one common league partner. This shall ensure long term holistic growth and sustainability to the National league ecosystem of the country,” the I-League clubs reportedly wrote to AIFF deputy secretary general M Satyanarayan.I-League clubs gave AIFF the ultimatum of announcing the new season in the next 10 days with kick-off by December 15 and not later than January 5, 2026 with matches to be broadcast live on two of the biggest properties - Star Sports and JioHotstar; Sony Sports Network and SonyLiv.AIFF had asked for all the stakeholders to join in consecutive meetings on less than three-hour notice. The desperate move was necessitated by the impending Supreme Court hearing where Chairperson of the Bid Evaluation Committee, Justice (Retd.) L. Nageswara Rao, is due to brief the court on the current situation in Indian football. On November 7, AIFF's attempt to attract bids for the commercial rights found no takers.","The All India Football Federation (AIFF) convened back-to-back meetings with multiple stakeholders in order to address the current predicament facing Indian football.

Poll Should the AIFF take immediate action to secure the future of Indian football? Yes, it's urgent. No, let the current situation play out.

Three of India's top football clubs have halted operations amid the uncertainty over the future of the sport in the country. Kerala Blasters , Mohun Bagan Super Giant and Odisha FC have all suspended operations of their first teams. For the four teams that remain in the AIFF Super Cup, it is going to be business as usual - for now.East Bengal, Punjab FC, FC Goa and Mumbai City FC will play their AIFF Super Cup semi-finals on December 4 and 5 with the final on December 7. All matches will be played at the Fatorda Stadium in Goa.Sources within Punjab FC and Mumbai City FC have confirmed tothat the players have been given an extended break since their last encounter.Mumbai City FC last played on November 6 against Kerala Blasters and Punjab FC's last fixture came against Bengaluru FC on November 5.A Punjab FC insider revealed the players are due to report back for training on November 14. Mumbai City FC, meanwhile, confirmed that it is ""business as usual for now.""FC Goa players and staff are also due to return on November 14, a club official confirmed. Before the AIFF Super Cup semi-final, they will take on Iraq's Al Zawraa SC in the AFC Champions League Two on November 26.So, they will focus on the continental tournament ""independent of what is happening in Indian football.""Beyond the three teams that have stopped operations, Chennaiyin FC have told their players they're unsure of when the training will resume; NorthEast United have given players an extended break and Odisha FC are yet to get their pre-season underway.The period of uncertainty has been brought on since AIFF's tender to sell the commercial rights of the Indian Super League (ISL) found no bidders. The deadline to bid for the rights came once (November 5) and then again but eventually saw no interest by 5 pm on November 7.On Sunday, the bid evaluation committee comprising AIFF president Kalyan Chaubey, former SC Justice L. Nageswara Rao and Asian Football Confederation's (AFC) Kesvaran Murugasu met and stated their response will be submitted in the Supreme Court as part of the process.The unprecedent situation has been brought on with Football Sports Development Limited (FSDL) and AIFF not extending their agreement that ends on December 8. When the football federation put the tender publicly, four bidders showed initial interest, before pulling out as request for proposal (RFP) wasn't considered to be ""commercially viable.""Meanwhile, with the season in serious threat and their livelihoods on the line, the players came together as one.“To put it simply,” said the players in a statement that was later shared on social media, “we want to play, and now.”“This is a plea to all those involved in running our sport in the country, to do whatever it takes to get the football season underway,” the statement read.“India needs its competitive football now more than ever. As for us, we remain committed, professional and ready to walk out of that tunnel and onto the pitch the moment we're told we can. All we ask of those running our beautiful game, to match our desperation with honest intent. We've found ourselves in a very dark tunnel for long. We could do with a little light.”The statement was shared by some of Indian football's biggest names - Sunil Chhetri, Sandesh Jhingan, Gurpreet Singh Sandhu, Rahul Bheke, Lallianzuala Chhangte.

More NFL coverage

Mason Taylor has football in his blood, thanks to his parents, and his rise with the New York Jets reflects a story shaped by family, legacy and dedication. His journey has often unfolded under the glow of a famous last name, yet he carries that weight with surprising ease. Instead of retreating from his lineage, he speaks openly about embracing it. “There’s high expectations, for sure,” he told the Associated Press in May 2025. “When people say, like, ‘Oh, let him have his shine,’ ... ‘Stop saying his dad’s name,’ I mean, I love it. We’re family.” Those words show a young athlete who understands where he comes from and proudly steps forward with that history behind him.Even after his parents’ divorce in 2015, the support around him stayed strong.From LSU to the Jets, Mason has always had someone cheering from the stands. That stability helped him carve out his own identity while honoring the path set by those before him.Mason’s father, Jason Taylor, spent 15 seasons in the NFL as a defensive end for the Jets, Miami Dolphins and the Washington Commanders. His six Pro Bowls, 139.5 sacks and NFL Defensive Player of the Year award in 2006 made him one of the most respected defenders of his era.His Hall of Fame induction in 2017 only confirmed that legacy. Jason’s story also reminds aspiring athletes that stars do not always begin as top recruits. He fought for his place at the University of Akron before the Dolphins selected him in the third round of the 1997 draft. After retiring in 2011, he remained close to the sport and now coaches defensive ends at the University of Miami.Katina Taylor’s connection to football runs just as deep. Her brother, Zach Thomas, is an NFL Hall of Famer and one of the most dominant linebackers in league history. Katina built her own career in sports media after earning a degree in broadcast journalism from Texas Tech University. She worked for CBS Sports covering the Dolphins, giving her firsthand experience in the world Mason would later enter.Together, Jason and Katina raised three children: Mason, Isaiah and Zoë. Their schedules often pull them in different directions, but they cherish rare moments together. Katina shared that joy in a birthday message for Mason, writing, “Celebrating Mason’s 21st Birthday, 🥳🥂 all 3 of my kids home at the same time. ... Grateful for this special time in our lives. May all your wishes come true Mase. ❤️🙏🏼 We love you. ”Mason’s bond with his mother shows in moments like LSU’s dramatic win over Alabama in 2022. He recalled searching for her after scoring the game winner, saying, “It was a cool moment.” Her support continues across states and tight travel schedules. “She’s really dedicated as a mother,” he added.Both parents remain committed to community work. The Jason Taylor Foundation supports education and mentorship in South Florida, while Katina focuses on youth empowerment through Camp Katina and Dig Deeper, her family’s beach volleyball and life-skills program.Their influence continues to shape Mason, both as an athlete and as a young man who understands the power of family, purpose and giving back.","Mason Taylor's rise with the New York Jets reflects a story shaped by family, legacy and dedication.

Sauce Gardner seems to have stepped into a brand new spotlight, and this time it has nothing to do with football. The Indianapolis Colts star was seen leaving a Miami dinner with Brooklyn, the sister of rapper Latto, instantly sparking whispers about a fresh romance, as reported by TMZ. The timing could not have been more striking. Gardner was on a bye week, but fans were more interested in who he left with than where the Colts stand this season.What made the sighting buzzworthy was the quiet chemistry caught on camera. Gardner walked out of Carbone with a small group, opened the passenger door for Brooklyn and drove off with her. One woman hid beneath a hoodie, and many wondered if Latto herself was close by. With his long-rumored connection to Ice Spice fading, this moment signaled a shift that fans were quick to notice.Rapper Ice Spice and Ahmed “Sauce” Gardner first sparked rumors in February, when the pair began appearing at events and gatherings together. Their early sightings encouraged speculation, but the rapper settled the conversation herself in September. Speaking on Baby, This is Keke Palmer, she confirmed their relationship, saying, “Yeah, I did confirm that on my Instagram,"" before adding, “I didn’t think it would be such a big deal, but like, it really is a big deal … it was fun.It was cute. We’re still friends. We were just dating.”Their bond played out both online and in public. Gardner once posted a set of photos with her beside a silver Rolls-Royce, though he later deleted them. Ice also shared a mirror selfie with the NFL star that eventually disappeared. During her interview, she explained she enjoys affection, gifts and time together, but is focused on her own growth. “I’m really focused on me. I always put myself first; that’s what it’s like dating me,"" she said.Gardner kept his comments brief but thoughtful. He once told TMZ, “She is from New York. I play in New York,” before calling her talented and noting that both deal with criticism despite their success. “Two people that get hated on that are really good at what we do. So you know we got a lot in common,"" he added.With Ice Spice confirming they remain friends, and Gardner now spending time with Brooklyn, the next chapter in his personal life seems to be unfolding right in front of fans.","Sauce Gardner was seen leaving a Miami dinner with Brooklyn, the sister of rapper Latto.

Travis Hunter’s rookie season with the Jacksonville Jaguars took an unexpected turn when a non-contact knee injury in practice forced him into surgery and an early shutdown. The setback hit hard because he was starting to find real momentum on the field. Now the 22-year-old is recovering at home with his baby boy in his arms while his wife, Leanna, keeps the family running with her usual humor and honesty. She even teased him on Instagram, sharing a sweet picture of father and son with the caption, “taking care of 2 babies is not for the weak.”The timing of the injury was especially painful because Hunter was fresh off his strongest performance yet. He had eight catches for 101 yards and his first NFL touchdown, a milestone that Leanna had also joked about online. Their supporters know this playful back and forth well. During his time at Colorado, she became a familiar face on the sidelines with custom Hunter boots and handmade game day outfits that always turned heads. Nothing has changed now that he is in the NFL.Hunter’s path to Jacksonville brought high expectations. He arrived as the 2024 Heisman Trophy winner and the second overall pick of the 2025 NFL Draft. The Jaguars traded with the Cleveland Browns to secure him because they believed in what he could bring as a two-way playmaker.For a while, he looked every bit the rising star they hoped for. Then the practice injury changed the timeline. Reports from ESPN and NFL.com noted that early confidence about a late season return faded once doctors confirmed he needed LCL surgery. Jacksonville later announced he would not play again this year.Off the field, fans have shifted their attention to the couple’s life at home. Travis and Leanna surprised many earlier this year when they revealed they had welcomed their first child in late August. The little boy drew immediate attention for looking just like his dad. Now that Hunter is recovering, supporters are enjoying the small family moments that Leanna shares, including her playful jab that she is caring for two babies at once. Her lighthearted updates gave fans a cheerful break during a tough season and reminded everyone that even elite athletes get humbled in the sweetest ways at home.","Travis Hunter’s rookie season with the Jacksonville Jaguars took an unexpected turn when a non-contact knee injury in practice forced him into surgery.

Being married to one of the NFL’s biggest stars comes with intense public pressure, nonstop scrutiny, and plenty of unwanted attention.

But what’s striking is how Brittany’s confidence and her honesty have evolved alongside her husband’s rise.She’s candid about the early challenges, the insecurities she had to overcome, and the reality of women constantly trying to get close to him. Yet she’s equally firm that their foundation began long before the flashing cameras. As their partnership grows, so does her sense of security, making her one of the most self-assured and outspoken WAGs in today’s NFL landscape.During a 2023 Instagram Q&A, Brittany addressed a question fans have long wondered about: how she handles “all the women trying to get after your husband.” Her response, equal parts blunt and unbothered, added a refreshing dose of honesty to the conversation.“Lol it’s actually really sad how disrespectful some women are... But they are a waist [sic] of my time & not going to disturb my peace,” she wrote, making it clear she has no intention of letting strangers ruin her day. She even admitted that, in the beginning, the constant flirting and attention used to get to her, but over time, she sharpened her resilience. “I am now to a point where I could care less!”Her growth didn’t happen overnight. When Patrick’s career skyrocketed, Brittany faced the harsher side of public fame much earlier than most young partners do.On Netflix’s Quarterback, she reflected on the shock of suddenly being thrust into the spotlight, saying, “I was not prepared for this… I didn’t expect it to skyrocket this soon, and us kind of just being thrown into the fire.”Their long history, dating back to high school, has become one of her greatest sources of confidence. It also shields her from accusations that she’s only in it for fame or money. As she joked to a fan calling her a gold digger: “I wish I dug and found gold.”And through it all, Patrick has helped her adapt. Growing up with a professional athlete father, he learned early how to tune out noise. Brittany says they now approach the chaos as a team, one reason she no longer lets outside opinions shake her peace.","Brittany Mahomes is the wife of Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes.

Blake Lively quietly signals reconciliation with Taylor Swift after months of tension as her wedding to Travis Kelce nears,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/blake-lively-quietly-signals-reconciliation-with-taylor-swift-after-months-of-tension-as-her-wedding-to-travis-kelce-nears/articleshow/125298273.cms,"Months of speculation about a rift between Taylor Swift and Blake Lively may be easing. Lively's recent 'like' on Swift's Instagram post, after a period of silence including missing Swift's engagement announcement, signals a potential thaw. This subtle digital gesture offers a hopeful sign for their friendship as Swift plans her high-profile wedding.

Blake Lively quietly signals a warming truce with Taylor Swift after months of distance

More coverage on NFL:

For months, rumors of a deep freeze between Taylor Swift and Blake Lively have swirled through tabloids and fan spaces, fueled by legal drama, shifting friend-group dynamics, and the growing spotlight on Swift’s upcoming wedding to Travis Kelce. Their once-visible friendship, marked by birthday tributes, holiday parties, and family hangouts, seemed to fade amid Lively’s tense legal battle with It Ends With Us co-star Justin Baldoni, a dispute that unexpectedly dragged Swift into the narrative.With allegations, countersuits, and a brief subpoena request, the situation created a storm neither woman asked for. Reports suggested that while “Taylor is working to trust Blake again,” rebuilding that bond “is going to take some time.” But a small, surprising moment may signal that thaw is finally beginning.What caught fans off guard wasn’t a public statement or a photographed reunion, it was Blake Lively’s quiet decision to like Swift’s recent Instagram post announcing The Life of a Showgirl. For months, Lively had noticeably avoided engaging with Swift’s posts, even skipping the singer’s engagement announcement to Travis Kelce in August.That silence fueled speculation that she wouldn’t make the wedding guest list, especially after insiders claimed the pair “aren’t as close” as they once were.So when Lively showed up in Swift’s likes, days after the album announcement went live, it didn’t go unnoticed. For a fanbase that tracks every digital breadcrumb, this was the first meaningful sign of a softening divide. The timing is particularly striking as Swift moves deeper into wedding planning mode, with expectations that her inner circle will be tighter, more private, and more drama-free than ever.Lively’s delayed love may have been deliberate, a subtle olive branch without inviting immediate media frenzy. And while a single tap on Instagram isn’t a formal reconciliation, it suggests an openness to reconnect, something many fans believed might never happen.As Swift heads toward one of the most high-profile weddings of the decade, every shift in her inner circle draws attention. Whether Lively ultimately appears by her side or simply cheers from afar, this moment shows the door between them isn’t fully closed and may, in fact, be cracking open again.","Blake Lively's recent 'like' on Taylor Swift's Instagram post signals a potential thaw.

How Shaquille O’Neal’s stress-relief habit led to Adam Sandler’s movie roles



Anthony Anderson Had Shaq In TEARS, Talks Shohei & Luka + How He Got Roles In Adam Sandler’s Movies

Shaquille O’Neal and Adam Sandler’s shared love of basketball deepened the bond



Shaquille O’Neal has lived a life filled with championships, endorsements, and unforgettable NBA moments, but his leap into comedy films came from a place few expected. During the height of his career, the pressures of being a franchise cornerstone weighed on him. Games were high-stakes, his workload was massive, and the public scrutiny grew louder every season. To stay centered, O’Neal developed a simple ritual: he turned to comedies. Adam Sandler ’s films, in particular, became his escape. Those nights spent laughing not only eased stress but unknowingly laid the groundwork for one of the most unexpected NBA-to-Hollywood pipelines.O’Neal’s personality always extended beyond the court, but comedy gave him something different.It allowed him to detach from missed free throws, media noise, and playoff pressure. What started as a private coping mechanism evolved into a connection that would later lead him to movie sets, surrounded by the Happy Madison crew. His acting roles did not happen by accident. They were the byproduct of a long-running inside joke between him and one of Hollywood’s biggest comedians.Shaquille O’Neal opened up about the origins of the partnership on his Big Podcast, explaining how movies were part of his recovery routine during his NBA years.“Music and movies kept me out of the, ‘You missed 30 free throws etc. etc,’ I would spend 20 hours worrying about that, but I needed time to recharge. So I got to laugh. Only way to recharge is laugh or hear something I like,” he said. For him, humor wasn’t just entertainment. It was maintenance.That connection grew whenever Sandler sat courtside. O’Neal often found himself shouting playful requests after big plays. According to him, their banter eventually became a running challenge.“Adam Sandler, he’s still hot, but he was hot at the time. I’d always say, ‘Hey man, you got to put me in a movie.’ And he was smart. ‘Win me a championship big fella.’ He’d always say that. So then after the first championship, ‘Hey man put me in a movie.’ ‘Win another championship big fella.’ He would always say that.”Sandler kept the promise. After O’Neal retired, he received a call through a mutual friend that changed everything. “So then after I retired, my guy Danny called me and said, ‘Hey man. Adam Sandler said he would always tell you he would put you in his movies. He’s got four movies for you.’ So he put me in movies back-to-back,” O’Neal said. The result was a string of appearances in Jack & Jill, Grown Ups 2, Blended, and Hubie Halloween, all under Sandler’s Happy Madison banner.Sandler’s ties to basketball are well-known. From Uncut Gems to Hustle, the comedian has built much of his creative world around the sport. That connection made O’Neal an ideal addition to his projects. Years earlier, O’Neal told PopCulture.com about the original challenge: “Crazy thing about the Adam Sandler movies - he used to sit there with Jack Nicholson. I used to always, especially after I scored a bucket and the crowd goes crazy, I'd be like, 'Adam, give me a movie!' He would say, 'Win a championship first. ’”When Sandler eventually called, he reminded O’Neal of the deal. “He called me up one day and said, ‘Shaq, you got four championships, I owe you four movies.’”O’Neal may never anchor a dramatic Oscar contender, but he doesn’t need to. He has done his part well and lived his long-time dream.Also Read: Throwback: Did Shaquille O’Neal really get invited to ex-wife Shaunie Henderson’s second wedding?","Shaquille O’Neal and Adam Sandler’s shared love of basketball deepened the bond between the two men.

Stephen Curry and Under Armour stand at a surprising crossroads facing an unexpected twist

When Stephen Curry of the Golden State Warriors decided to pursue his signature sneakers with Under Armour, he set his own course. However, Under Armour stated on Thursday that they have split from Curry, and now the NBA pro will run the Curry Brand on its own. Following the release of his 13th and last signature shoe, Curry is leaving, concluding a 13-year collaboration.It happened after the debut of Curry's next signature shoe. It puts an end to a long-standing connection that began before Curry's first NBA championship. It is anticipated that Curry would take the ""Curry Brand"" with him as a stand-alone business. He is currently more valuable than ever because he has never been a sneaker free agent.Stephen Curry and Under Armour announced on Thursday that they had mutually decided to terminate their 13-year collaboration with immediate effect. At a time when the sportswear company is having trouble boosting sales, the abrupt move splits Curry Brand from Under Armour.Curry is now free to choose another retail partner. Although there seems to have been some desire for the Curry Brand to remain independent, it's not immediately evident what caused this separation.In a press release, Under Armour said:""Under Armour Inc. and Stephen Curry today announced plans to separate Curry Brand from Under Armour, ending a partnership that has redefined performance product and athlete-led storytelling for more than a decade. Under Armour, with a disciplined focus on its namesake brand, will develop new UA Basketball products and continue to support athletes and programs across every level of the game.""Addressing the whole thing, Steph said during a podcast:“Under Armour believed in me early in my career and gave me the space to build something much bigger and more impactful than a shoe. I'll always be grateful for that. What Curry Brand stands for, what I stand for and my commitment to that mission will never change.”Meanwhile, Under Armour CEO Kevin Plank said in a statement:“For Under Armour, this moment is about discipline and focus on the core UA brand during a critical stage of our turnaround.. And for Stephen, it’s the right moment to let what we created evolve on his terms. We’ll always be grateful for what he’s brought to the UA team.”It is anticipated that Curry would take the ""Curry Brand"" with him as a stand-alone business. According to a statement from Curry, via CNBC:""What Curry Brand stands for, what I stand for and my commitment to that mission will never change, it’s only growing stronger.. I'm excited for a future that's focused on aggressive growth with a continued commitment to keep showing up for the next generation.""After four years with Nike, Steph signed a contract with Under Armour in October 2013. After twelve years, the collaboration is coming to an end. One more Curry shoe is still on the horizon from Under Armour. As scheduled, the Curry 13 will debut in February 2026.Also read: What did Stephen Curry write to Ayesha Curry before dating?

Jason Kidd’s Job and the Coaching Factor

The Road to February 5

Los Angeles Lakers general manager Rob Pelinka is reportedly keeping a close eye on Dallas Mavericks center Daniel Gafford as the franchise looks to strengthen its interior presence around Luka Doncic. With the NBA season moving quickly toward the February 5 trade deadline, the Lakers are exploring ways to maintain momentum behind their new cornerstone star.Gafford, who has emerged as a bright spot on a struggling Mavericks team that entered Friday night with a 2-6 record, has drawn interest from several teams. According to ClutchPoints’ Bret Siegel, “Several teams continue to monitor Daniel Gafford, including the Los Angeles Lakers, sources told.” Siegel also noted that this speculation is influenced heavily by Dallas’ slow start to the season. (H/t: Sporting News)Luka Doncic has been performing at an MVP-level clip, averaging 40 points, 11 rebounds, and nine assists. Since joining the Lakers to become the franchise face post-LeBron James, he has delivered every bit of the dominance the front office envisioned.However, Los Angeles still lacks an ideal vertical lob partner. Deandre Ayton remains productive but has struggled with finishing consistently around the rim. That concern has opened the door for the front office to explore a more explosive option, such as Gafford.Gafford’s skill set - rim-running, shot-blocking, mobility, and verticality - makes him an attractive option for a Lakers team built around Luka’s passing and pace.The Mavericks’ slow start raises questions about how aggressively the team will reshape the roster. Dallas' GM may hesitate to move veteran players when the franchise still doesn’t know what the finished product will look like this season.Kyrie Irving’s ACL tear has kept him out for most of the year, and his return timeline remains uncertain. If the Mavericks continue to slide, the organization may decide there’s little reason to rush him back.Even in the face of adversity, Dallas does have talent around Flagg and Davis to make a push for at least a Play-In seed. But their direction could shift quickly depending on their results over the next several weeks.Another major variable is head coach Jason Kidd. Despite signing an extension, his job security is not guaranteed. NBA history is filled with examples of coaches being fired with years left on their contracts.With the Mavericks’ performance dipping and expectations rising around Flagg’s development, Dallas GM will eventually need to determine whether the problem lies with the roster or on the bench.Dallas’ direction leading up to the trade deadline will be one of the league’s most watched situations. A struggling start could push Harrison toward a soft reset around Flagg, while a turnaround might convince him to stay the course.Also read: NBA trade rumors: Los Angeles Lakers could sign $54 million Dallas Mavericks superstar in a bold move to strengthen roster around Luka Doncic For the Lakers, the vision is clearer. With Luka Doncic carrying the franchise forward and playing at a historic level, securing a dependable lob threat is a priority. Whether that leads them back to the Mavericks’ front office will become clearer as the season unfolds.","Los Angeles Lakers general manager Rob Pelinka is reportedly keeping a close eye on Dallas Mavericks center Daniel Gafford.

Expected Starters and Game Preview

The Cleveland Cavaliers head into tonight’s matchup against the Toronto Raptors with renewed confidence as Donovan Mitchell prepares to return to the floor. After sitting out the previous game for rest, Cleveland’s leading star is expected to be back in uniform with no injury designation holding him back. His presence immediately elevates the stakes in what is shaping up to be one of the most anticipated matchups of the week.The timing couldn’t be better for the Cavs. With multiple rotational players still recovering from injuries, Mitchell’s availability becomes crucial for a team looking to stay competitive in the early stages of the season. Fans who were concerned after he missed Wednesday’s contest can breathe easy knowing the team’s offensive centerpiece is “good to go” for the Central Division showdown.Donovan Mitchell is set to return after being rested against the Miami Heat, and reports for November 13, 2025, confirm that he enters tonight’s game without any injury issues. Cleveland will rely heavily on his production, especially with Darius Garland (toe) and Jaylon Tyson (concussion) still ruled out. Lonzo Ball is also unavailable as he continues to rest his left knee, while Max Strus is dealing with a lingering foot problem despite no longer wearing a walking boot.Evan Mobley, who also rested on Wednesday, is expected to rejoin Mitchell in the starting lineup.Cleveland will again be without several important contributors. Garland aggravated the toe that previously required surgery, keeping him off the court for another game. Tyson remains in concussion protocol, and Ball’s precautionary rest removes another ball-handling option from the rotation. Strus’ foot issue has limited him, though his condition continues to show signs of improvement. With Mitchell and Mobley returning, the Cavs regain star power at a much-needed moment.Compared to Cleveland, the Raptors bring a shorter injury list into the matchup. Sandro Mamukelashvili (neck) and Ochai Agbaji (back) are both listed as questionable, while Collin Murray-Boyles is considered a game-time decision due to illness. The uncertainty surrounding their depth adds intrigue to how Toronto will manage rotations.Projected lineups for the night include Donovan Mitchell, De’Andre Hunter, Max Strus, Evan Mobley, and Jarrett Allen for Cleveland. Toronto is expected to counter with Immanuel Quickley, Brandon Ingram, RJ Barrett, Scottie Barnes, and Jakob Poeltl. Mitchell comes in averaging an impressive 30.4 points, 5.4 assists, and 4.4 rebounds on 51% shooting overall and 40.4% from deep. His scoring versatility and ability to create plays give Cleveland a significant advantage against a Raptors defense that ranks in the middle range.","Donovan Mitchell is set to return after being rested against the Miami Heat on Wednesday.

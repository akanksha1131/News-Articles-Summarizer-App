Shivam Dube press conference: On Ishan and Surya’s knock & his role with the ball

NEW DELHI: During his two-year international wilderness, Ishan Kishan underwent some serious soul-searching and asked himself a single question: ""Can I again wear that India jersey and perform?"" The answer was an emphatic yes, reflected in a destructive 76 off 32 balls in just his second international appearance since his comeback, turning New Zealand’s daunting target of 209 in the second T20I into what looked like a walk in the park.After deservingly being named Player of the Match, Kishan was asked what he told himself when he was dropped from the Indian team. He replied: ""I asked myself one question (his comeback) - can I do it again or not? And I had a very clear answer.""Kishan’s journey back was a textbook example of returning to the domestic grind and rebuilding from the bottom up. He featured in tournaments such as the Buchi Babu Trophy and DY Patil before leading Jharkhand to their maiden Syed Mushtaq Ali National T20 title, finishing the season with over 500 runs.""I was just looking to score runs (in domestic cricket). Sometimes it's important to do it for yourself, to answer your own questions about how you're batting and whether you're capable of playing for India. That's why it was important for me to play domestic cricket and get runs.""The good part was that we won the trophy as well, and I carried that confidence here. So it was a pretty good day for me,"" the 'Pocket Dynamo' from Patna said.For Kishan, mindset mattered more than anything else, which allowed him to dominate even after India were reduced to 6 for 2 following the dismissal of Abhishek Sharma ""I was focusing more on what I had to do today and being in a very good headspace for this game. Sometimes you understand that you're batting well. I just needed to get runs somewhere to answer my questions. Even if I got out, I just wanted to play good cricket, that was it.""Despite scoring at a strike rate close to 240, Kishan said he consciously avoided risky shots.""We were looking not to take risks, not to go cross-batted, but I was still looking to score as many runs as possible in the powerplay. At the end of the day, when you're chasing a 200-plus total, you have to get good runs in the powerplay.""",Ishan Kishan scored 76 off 32 balls in India's second T20I win over New Zealand. The Jharkhand batsman had been out of the Indian team for two years. He was named Player of the Match in the second match of the T20 series. The 'Pocket Dynamo' said he was looking to score runs to answer his questions.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127354420,imgsize-65668,width-400,resizemode-4/ishan-kishan-2401-pti.jpg"

Shivam Dube press conference: On Ishan and Surya’s knock & his role with the ball

NEW DELHI: Indian skipper Suryakumar Yadav said the hosts want their batters to play with freedom and express themselves, praising Ishan Kishan ’s fearless strokeplay as a true reflection of the team’s mindset after India defeated New Zealand by seven wickets in the second T20I in Raipur on Friday.Despite some assistance from the dew, India’s chase of 209 began on a shaky note. Sanju Samson departed for 6, Abhishek Sharma fell for a golden duck, and the hosts were suddenly reeling at 6 for 2. What followed, however, was a breathtaking counterattack as Ishan Kishan and Suryakumar Yadav added 122 runs in just 48 balls for the third wicket, transforming what appeared to be a daunting chase into a comfortable one.Kishan did most of the early damage with his aggressive approach, scoring 76 off 32 balls, including a 21-ball fifty, before mis-hitting Ish Sodhi for a catch off the bowler’s own bowling. By then, the contest had already swung decisively in India’s favour.Suryakumar, meanwhile, finished with a superb 82 off just 37 balls, once again underlining his class and importance to the side only weeks ahead of a home T20 World Cup.""I didn't know what Ishan had for lunch. Never saw anyone hit the ball like he did. This is what we want from the batters to go out there and express themselves, be happy. I was angry he didn't give me a strike in the Power-play.But I knew that we had time and could cover up. I was batting really well in the nets, I got some good time with family and friends, and I am enjoying what's happening right now,"" Suryakumar Yadav said after the match.The emphatic finish also became the biggest win by balls remaining for a full-member nation while chasing a target of over 200. It surpassed Pakistan’s 24-ball win against New Zealand in Auckland in 2025 and Australia’s 23-ball victory over West Indies in Basseterre in the same year.India’s bowling, however, had its struggles. Arshdeep Singh endured a difficult outing, conceding 53 runs without a wicket. Hardik Pandya was more economical, returning figures of 1 for 25 from three overs, while Harshit Rana, despite bowling a wicket maiden, finished with 1 for 35 from three overs. The spin pair of Kuldeep Yadav and Varun Chakaravarthy combined for eight overs, claiming three wickets while giving away 70 runs. Shivam Dube also chipped in with a wicket.Suryakumar praised the collective bowling effort, admitting that India had feared New Zealand could push the total to 225–230, while singling out Kuldeep Yadav, Varun Chakaravarthy, Shivam Dube and Hardik Pandya for restricting the visitors to 208.""It was an incredible effort. We thought they would add 225-230. The way Kuldeep, Varun, Dube, and Hardik. Everyone took their responsibility, and to restrict them to under 210 was a great effort.""He also highlighted the relaxed and positive atmosphere within the camp, stressing that India remain committed to playing their brand of cricket while giving their all in every aspect.""I am really enjoying. The mood in the camp is happy. We want to play the same brand of cricket and leave no stone unturned.""",India defeated New Zealand by seven wickets in the second T20I in Raipur on Friday.

Suryakumar Yadav press conference: On India T20I Playing XI, personal form and more

NEW DELHI: India moved 2-0 ahead in the five-match T20 series after beating New Zealand by seven wickets in the second match on Friday in Raipur. Ishan Kishan marked his return to the national side with 76 off 32 balls, after failing in the first T20I, while captain Suryakumar Yadav scored 82 not out off 37 balls, his first fifty after 23 innings.Chasing 209, India reached the target in 15.2 overs despite losing both openers Abhishek Sharma and Sanju Samson inside the first two overs.

Shivam Dube supported Suryakumar at the end with 36 not out off 18 balls as India finished the chase comfortably.Kishan hit 11 fours and four sixes. His innings included shots square of the wicket and down the ground. Such was the timing and impact of the innings that Kishan got a hug from his skipper after mistiming a slog sweep off Ish Sodhi's bowling.Earlier, New Zealand posted 208 for six after being asked to bat. Devon Conway scored 19 off nine balls and Tim Seifert made 24 off 13 as the visitors made a quick start. Rachin Ravindra added 44 off 26 balls, while Glenn Phillips fell to Kuldeep Yadav in the middle overs.Kuldeep picked up two wickets, helping India control the scoring after the powerplay. Shivam Dube removed Daryl Mitchell in the 12th over, slowing New Zealand’s momentum. Mitchell Santner then scored 47 not out off 27 balls to ensure his team crossed 200, with 57 runs coming from the last five overs.India opted to bowl first, keeping in mind the possibility of dew. Harshit Rana and Kuldeep Yadav came into the side, with Jasprit Bumrah rested and Axar Patel unavailable due to injury.With this win, India now lead the T20I series 2-0.","India beat New Zealand by seven wickets in the second T20I in Raipur.

'Indian cricket no less than Bollywood abroad' | Bombay Sport Exchange

Former New Zealand wicketkeeper Ian Smith has questioned India’s decision to leave Rishabh Pant out of their T20 World Cup squad, saying a player of his ability should “walk into any T20 side”.Pant, who is currently recovering from a side strain, has not featured in India’s T20 plans since the 2024 World Cup in Barbados. Sanju Samson has been named as the first-choice wicketkeeper-batter for the upcoming tournament, with Ishan Kishan included among the reserves.Speaking to PTI on the sidelines of the second T20 between India and New Zealand, Smith said he would have selected Pant ahead of Samson.“I’d pick Rishabh Pant in my team any day of the week. I’m surprised that Rishabh Pant is not here. He is a wonderfully gifted player. He can win a match. That’s what you’ve got to have with T20 players. They’ve got to be match-winners,” Smith said.Smith said team balance often dictated selection decisions in modern T20 cricket and suggested that leaving out Shubman Gill to accommodate Samson at the top of the order was understandable.“These sides are all about balance. You haven’t got room for too many players who only have one discipline.It’s all about finding the right mix,” he said.He added that wicketkeeper-batters were now expected to bat higher up the order to justify their place in the side.“Invariably, wicketkeepers used to bat at seven. Now they have to bat in the top four to be worth their soap. Their primary strength has to be batting, with wicketkeeping as the secondary skill,” Smith said.Citing New Zealand’s approach, Smith pointed to Tim Seifert as an example of a player who offers value in both disciplines.“He’s equally good as a keeper and as a batter. It’s hard to split his skills. Those kinds of players are gold because they help the balance of the side,” he said.Smith also named India among his top contenders to defend their T20 World Cup title, noting the advantage of playing at home.“India have got a good chance to defend because they’re playing at home and know the conditions very well. But it’s a very even competition. About five teams could win it,” he said.Smith also identified Australia, England, South Africa and New Zealand as teams capable of challenging for the title.",Former New Zealand wicketkeeper Ian Smith questions India's decision to leave Rishabh Pant out of their T20 World Cup squad.

Arshdeep Singh press conference: on adapting to conditions, team roles & bowling plans | IND vs NZ 1st T20I

Former Pakistan spinner Danish Kaneria has backed the ICC’s decision to stick to the original schedule after the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) chose not to travel to India for the 2026 ICC Men’s T20 World Cup. Kaneria said Bangladesh opting out would not make much of an impact, remarking that “it’s not like they were going to finish in the top four. ”Bangladesh had earlier informed the ICC of its decision not to travel to India, citing security concerns amid strained relations between the two countries, and requested that its matches be shifted to Sri Lanka. However, the ICC reiterated on Wednesday that the T20 World Cup will go ahead as planned, with Bangladesh’s matches scheduled to be played in India.The standoff comes in the backdrop of the BCCI directing Kolkata Knight Riders to release Bangladesh pacer Mustafizur Rahman ahead of IPL 2026 amid prevailing political tensions.Speaking to IANS, Kaneria said, “There was the issue of Mustafizur, who was with KKR, and the team was forced to sideline him because of the kind of unrest and the public reaction. Shah Rukh Khan, who is the owner of KKR, released him. There was no pressure from the BCCI, nor from the ICC.But for humanity, he did what he thought was right.“The BCCI or ICC never asked Bangladesh not to come to India. They welcomed them. All the teams in the ICC umbrella get foolproof security.”Referring to the ICC meeting that followed, Kaneria added, “You saw that a meeting took place where all the boards were present—from England to Australia, West Indies—every board that is part of the ICC was there. When voting took place, everyone supported what the ICC proposed. Only the Pakistan Cricket Board voted along with Bangladesh. Just two votes went against it.”Kaneria also described the developments in Bangladesh prior to the standoff as disturbing on humanitarian grounds.“When I look at this entire scenario, what was going on in Bangladesh, the kind of situation that developed there, the way our Hindu brothers and sisters and others were treated, the way incidents happened, it was wrong, first of all,” Kaneria said.“Our religion doesn’t teach violence; it is a religion of love. People were just earning their livelihood, doing their jobs, and they were attacked without any reason. The strange and disturbing acts that took place were very sad. It really makes your heart sink—what is going on?”The former spinner warned that Bangladesh’s firm stance could hurt the country’s cricketing future in the long run.“In my view, this is not going to be good for Bangladesh in the long run. If they think that whatever they say should be accepted by the ICC as a decision, that won’t work. Going forward, India will not play with Bangladesh anyway, and that will be a big loss for them.”Backing the ICC’s decision-making process, Kaneria stressed that major tournaments cannot be altered at the last moment. “I believe the ICC’s decision is absolutely correct, because things cannot be changed at the last minute. You have to prepare the entire tournament structure, schedules, and team travel. You have to change the whole scenario.“If Bangladesh feels they don’t want to play, then don’t play. It won’t make much difference anyway; it’s not like they were going to finish in the top four,” he added.Dismissing reports that Pakistan could follow Bangladesh’s lead, Kaneria said the ICC has alternatives in place.“I don’t think that will happen. Because who suffers the loss? The country that backs out suffers the loss. There are penalties, rules and regulations. If Bangladesh doesn’t go, Scotland can come in. If Pakistan refuses, some other team will come. Namibia is playing very good cricket. The ICC and BCCI won’t be affected.”Kaneria also pointed out that Bangladesh’s participation could have opened doors for its players in the IPL. “If Bangladesh had come to play the T20 World Cup in India, then the barrier that has been created in the IPL with Mustafizur Rahman would have broken, and more Bangladeshi players would have taken part in the league.”He further lamented the shift in cricket discourse away from the sport itself.“Now cricket is no longer being discussed, and only politics is being talked about. Earlier, people talked about wickets, bowling, and techniques. Now everything has become political.”“Technical cricket doesn’t sell. What sells? Kohli vs Babar comparisons. Shaheen Afridi vs Bumrah comparisons,” he noted.Calling for restraint, Kaneria urged stakeholders to keep politics out of the sport.“For the future generation, it is very important that cricket is protected and promoted. Look at cricket as cricket. Let politics remain with politicians and authorities. Do not involve cricket in politics.”He concluded by emphasising the need for long-term thinking. “You have to look at the long picture, not the short. Now let’s see what the final decision is, though in my opinion it must already have been taken, as nearly 24 hours have passed. What is good for cricket must be done, and as I said earlier, Scotland would already be preparing to face spin.”","Bangladesh refused to travel to India for the 2026 ICC Men's T20 World Cup.

Arshdeep Singh press conference: on adapting to conditions, team roles & bowling plans | IND vs NZ 1st T20I

Former Pakistan captain Rashid Latif has called on the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) to take a hard stance and boycott the upcoming Men’s T20 World Cup, urging it to stand shoulder to shoulder with Bangladesh amid the ongoing scheduling and security dispute.The Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) is facing the threat of being excluded from the 20-team tournament if it refuses to travel to India, citing security concerns. On Wednesday, the ICC made its position clear, stating that the original schedule would remain unchanged and that Bangladesh’s request to relocate its matches to Sri Lanka would not be entertained. The BCB has been given a 24-hour window to consult with its government and confirm whether the team will participate.With tensions simmering between the ICC and the BCB, Latif said this was the right moment for Pakistan to challenge what he described as the prevailing cricketing power structure by withdrawing from the tournament.Recent reports in Pakistani media suggest the PCB has already expressed solidarity with Bangladesh, with the board’s leadership even pausing the national team’s World Cup preparations while awaiting clarity on the situation.“If Pakistan and India don’t happen, 50 per cent of your World Cup is gone. This is a great opportunity to challenge the existing cricket order,” Latif said on the YouTube channel CaughtBehindShow.“Pakistan should say they stand with Bangladesh and refuse to play the T20 World Cup. This is the time to take a stand. You need a strong heart to do it,” he added.Latif also took aim at the ICC’s handling of the issue, questioning its refusal to consider Bangladesh’s request to move matches to Sri Lanka. He pointed out that similar adjustments had been made in the past when India and Pakistan declined to tour each other for global events.“It doesn’t feel like a good decision. Today, the ICC says there is no danger to Bangladeshi players in India. No agency in the world can say there is no danger — how can the ICC say that?” Latif said. “Even in the most secure places, no one can give such a guarantee. Hopefully, nothing happens to any team.”He stressed that Pakistan holds significant leverage in the current scenario and should use it decisively.“The trump card is still with Pakistan. Bangladesh’s stance is right. Pakistan won’t get a better opportunity than this. Pakistan not playing would be like stopping the World Cup. Pakistan is the key,” Latif said. “Yes, Pakistan could suffer in the future. There could be sanctions if Pakistan refuses to play ICC events. But there is no use of just words — now is the time to show who you support.”The Men’s T20 World Cup is scheduled to be held in India and Sri Lanka from February 7 to March 8, with matches spread across eight venues. Bangladesh have been placed in Group C alongside England, Nepal, Italy and the West Indies. Pakistan, meanwhile, are drawn in Group A with India, Namibia, the Netherlands and the USA.","Former Pakistan captain Rashid Latif has called on the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) to take a hard stance and boycott the upcoming Men’s T20 World Cup.

Bangladesh cricket in turmoil: What it means for the T20 World Cup?

Every cricket team is known for a certain style. Australia is often linked with an aggressive approach and playing hard until the final ball. India is associated with its long line of top-class batters, from Sunil Gavaskar and Sachin Tendulkar to Virat Kohli. Pakistan is usually remembered for producing fast bowlers, from Imran Khan to Wasim Akram, Waqar Younis and Shoaib Akhtar.But before Pakistan became known for fast bowling, before the era of Imran Khan, Javed Miandad and Inzamam-ul-Haq, there was Hanif Mohammad. He was not quick in scoring or flashy in style. His strength lay in patience and time spent at the crease.On many occasions, Hanif stood between Pakistan and defeat. No innings explains his role better than what he produced in the first Test of Pakistan’s 1958 tour of the West Indies.The match was played in January 1958 (17 - 23 Jan, 1958) at Bridgetown, Barbados. Pakistan, still new to Test cricket, were playing their first Test against the West Indies. The home side’s batting line-up put Pakistan under pressure from the start. Conrad Hunte scored 142 on debut and struck 50 of the first 55 runs of the innings, even though Rohan Kanhai was batting at the other end.Everton Weekes made 197, the final century of his career. Collie Smith and Garry Sobers scored half-centuries, while Clyde Walcott added 43.Pakistan handed a debut to Nasim-ul-Ghani, who became the youngest Test cricketer at that time at 16 years and 248 days, but he went wicketless. West Indies finished their first innings on 579.Pakistan were bowled out for 106 in the first innings, and were asked to follow on, trailing by 473 runs. Hanif Mohammad walked out to open the second innings on the third afternoon. Remember this was a six-day Test match, and for Pakistan to avoid defeat, they would need to bat for almost four full days. Saving the match appeared beyond reach.Hanif relied on his ability to focus. The pitch was wearing, the bowling hostile, and local umpires were in charge. The ball often rose sharply. Hanif kept his head still and watched the ball closely. There were no helmets, his pads were thin, and he had no arm guard. A rolled hotel towel served as a thigh pad.West Indies attacked with the swing of Eric Atkinson, the pace of Roy Gilchrist, and the spin of Collie Smith and Alf Valentine. Gilchrist, known for his run-up, pace and action, led the short-ball attack.Hanif ended the rest day (after the second day of the Test) on five not out. His captain Abdul Kardar left him a brief note that read: ""You are our only hope.""By stumps on Day 3, Hanif had reached 61, choosing not to hook Gilchrist’s bouncers. Over the next three days, he stayed at the crease. On the fourth day, he scored exactly 100 runs while Pakistan lost only one wicket. On the fifth day, despite bruised thighs and sunburn that caused skin under his eyes to peel, he continued. During breaks, he sat quietly in the dressing room and ate a piece of chicken. At the close of play on Day 5, he was on 270 and Pakistan had taken a small lead.On the sixth day, Hanif slowed down and added 67 more runs before he was dismissed for 337. Pakistan were then 153 runs ahead. When Kardar declared at 657 for eight, the lead stood at 184, with only 11 overs left in the match. The Test was saved.Hanif’s innings included 26 fours, 16 threes, 40 twos and 105 singles. He batted for 970 minutes, though he later believed it was 999 minutes. He shared century partnerships with four players, including his brother Wazir Mohammad. Pakistan declared on 657 for eight, and the match ended in a draw.The innings concluded on this day, January 23, in 1958. It remains the longest individual innings in Test cricket by time spent at the crease and stands as Hanif Mohammad’s defining act of resistance.","Hanif Mohammad was not quick in scoring or flashy in style.

What is Bangladesh’s stance?

What is the ICC’s stand?

What sparked the standoff?

Poll Should the ICC consider moving the T20 World Cup matches from India to a neutral venue? Yes, for security reasons No, it should remain in India Undecided Only if the BCB provides more evidence

Hours after standing firm on its demand to have its T20 World Cup matches moved from India to Sri Lanka, the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) has written another letter to the International Cricket Council (ICC), requesting that Bangladesh’s demand for a change of venue be referred to the ICC’s independent dispute resolution committee, TimesofIndia.com has learnt.The committee, which consists of independent lawyers, resolves disputes related to ICC matters. The BCB hopes the ICC will respond to the request and refer the demand for a venue change to the Dispute Resolution Committee (DRC).The ICC Dispute Resolution Committee is an independent arbitration body that resolves disputes connected to international cricket. It can hear cases involving the ICC, member boards, players, officials and related parties, once all internal remedies have been exhausted.Operating under English law with proceedings seated in London, the DRC conducts confidential arbitration through independent panels. Its role is to assess the lawfulness and interpretation of ICC decisions, regulations and contracts, rather than act as an appeal forum.DRC rulings are final and binding, with no right of appeal except on very limited procedural grounds.Bangladesh has reiterated that its refusal to play the upcoming T20 World Cup in India is solely due to security concerns and is a sovereign decision.Sports Adviser Asif Nazrul said on Thursday that there is no scope for Bangladesh to change its decision not to travel to India for the tournament.“As the ICC has also not accepted Bangladesh’s request to change the venue, it now effectively means that Bangladesh will not be taking part in this year’s T20 World Cup,” Nazrul told reporters in Dhaka after meeting senior Bangladesh cricketers.Nazrul also accused the ICC of failing to ensure justice by not considering Bangladesh’s request for a venue shift.“Our security risk in playing in India has not changed at all,” he said. “This concern did not arise from any imaginary analysis or assumption. It arose from a real incident, where one of the best players of our country was forced to bow his head before extremists, and the Indian cricket board removed him from India, plainly speaking, asked him to leave.”Earlier on Wednesday, the ICC rejected the BCB’s request to relocate Bangladesh’s matches from India and decided to keep the tournament schedule unchanged following a board meeting. The ICC also gave the BCB a one-day deadline to decide, after consulting the government, whether the team would travel to India.“The ICC’s venue and scheduling decisions are guided by objective threat assessments, host guarantees and the tournament’s agreed terms of participation, which apply uniformly to all 20 competing nations,” the ICC said in a statement.“In the absence of any independent security findings that materially compromise the safety of the Bangladesh team, the ICC is unable to relocate fixtures. Doing so would carry significant logistical and scheduling consequences for other teams and fans worldwide, and would also create precedent-related challenges that risk undermining the neutrality, fairness and integrity of ICC governance.”Bangladesh are in Group C alongside England, Italy, West Indies and Nepal, and are scheduled to play their first three matches in Kolkata and their final game in Mumbai. They face West Indies on February 7, the opening day of the tournament.BCB president Aminul Islam Bulbul revealed that Mustafizur Rahman’s removal from an IPL team due to security concerns triggered Bangladesh’s hardened stance against travelling to India.Bulbul said Mustafizur was neither injured nor had he withdrawn from the IPL. The BCB hadn't revoked his No Objection Certificate either. “He was dropped due to security reasons,” Bulbul said, calling it a moment that raised serious red flags for Bangladesh cricket.According to Bulbul, once the BCB learned of Mustafizur’s removal, it immediately contacted the ICC on January 4.“We informed them of the situation and asked them to take it seriously,” he said. “If a player can be removed from a league due to security concerns, how can we ignore those same concerns for a World Cup?”Bulbul added that the BCB proposed solutions rather than confrontation, citing past instances where neutral venues or hybrid models were adopted due to security issues in ICC tournaments.“We asked the ICC to follow that logic,” he said. “Let us play the World Cup, but at a neutral venue like Sri Lanka or elsewhere.”","Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) has written another letter to the International Cricket Council (ICC) requesting that Bangladesh’s demand for a change of venue be referred to the ICC”s independent dispute resolution committee. The committee consists of independent lawyers, resolves disputes related to ICC matters. Sports Adviser Asif Nazrul said on Thursday that there is no scope for Bangladesh to change its decision not to travel to India.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127250667,imgsize-75732,width-400,resizemode-4/bangladesh-cricket-board.jpg"

Bangladesh cricket in turmoil: What it means for the T20 World Cup?

New Zealand players wore black armbands during the second T20 International against India in Raipur on Friday to mark a tragedy back home.The armbands were worn in memory of victims of severe storms and landslides in New Zealand’s upper North Island. Heavy rainfall led to flooding and a landslide at a campsite in Mount Maunganui on January 22, in which two people lost their lives.The tribute came as India chose to field after winning the toss. New Zealand, trailing 0-1 in the series, were looking to level the contest. Devon Conway and Tim Seifert opened the batting, both wearing black armbands as they walked out to bat under overcast conditions.Conway began with intent, hitting four boundaries in the opening over bowled by Arshdeep Singh, including a six over backward point. Seifert added 24 runs off 13 balls. Both openers were dismissed early, with Conway mistiming a slower delivery from Harshit Rana in the fourth over, while Seifert fell soon after.Fighting knocks from New Zealand captain Mitchell Santner and left-handed batter Raxchin Ravindra helped their side to post a challenging score of 208/6 in the second T20I against Team India.Earlier, India captain Suryakumar Yadav won the toss and opted to bowl. India made two changes to their playing XI, bringing in Harshit Rana and Kuldeep Yadav. Jasprit Bumrah was rested, while Axar Patel missed the match after picking up a knock in the previous game.New Zealand made three changes to their side, with Zak Foulkes, Matt Henry and Tim Seifert included in the XI.",The armbands were worn in memory of victims of severe storms and landslides in New Zealand’s upper North Island.

The ICC is considering action against Bangladesh after the country refused to tour India for the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup 2026, news agency ANI reported on Friday, quoting sources. ICC chairman Jay Shah is currently in Dubai, where a final decision on the matter is expected.The development comes a day after Bangladesh declined to send its national team to India for next month’s T20 World Cup after the ICC rejected its request to shift matches out of the country. The refusal has opened the possibility of Scotland replacing Bangladesh in the tournament.The ICC had earlier issued an ultimatum to Bangladesh on Wednesday, asking it to either agree to travel to India or risk being replaced. The world body said there was no credible threat to the safety of Bangladesh players, officials or fans. Bangladesh was given time until Thursday to respond. Scotland is next in line based on rankings for the tournament, which begins on February 7 in India and Sri Lanka.After a meeting with national team players, Bangladesh sports adviser Asif Nazrul said Thursday that the ICC’s security assessment was not acceptable to them.""While our cricketers have worked hard to qualify for the World Cup, the security risk regarding playing in India remains unchanged. This concern is not based on abstract analysis...,"" Nazrul said at a press conference while announcing that Bangladesh would not play in India.""...we are not convinced that they can ensure the safety of our entire team, journalists, and spectators.""""We are not giving up hope yet; our team is ready. We expect the ICC to provide justice by considering our genuine security risks and allowing us to play in Sri Lanka,"" he added.The Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) has also approached the ICC’s independent Dispute Resolution Committee (DRC) seeking relocation of Bangladesh’s matches outside India for the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup 2026, according to The Daily Star.The ICC Dispute Resolution Committee is an independent arbitration body that deals with disputes involving the ICC, its member boards, players and officials.If Bangladesh withdraws from the tournament, Scotland is likely to replace them based on current rankings.The issue began after Bangladesh pacer Mustafizur Rahman was removed from Kolkata Knight Riders’ squad for the upcoming Indian Premier League (IPL) 2026 season on the BCCI’s instructions, citing unspecified “developments all around”.Following Rahman’s removal, the BCB said its team would not travel to India for its T20 World Cup group matches scheduled in Kolkata and Mumbai, citing security concerns.The BCB has sought permission to play all four of its group-stage matches in Sri Lanka, where the India-Pakistan match will also be played under the agreed hybrid arrangement for ICC events until 2027.","Bangladesh refused to tour India for the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup 2026.

Replacement teams in ICC events



Scotland replaced New Zealand in 2022:

Similar drama in 2009 T20 World Cup



The ICC T20 World Cup 2026 is just two weeks away, and the controversy over the participation of the Bangladesh cricket team in the tournament remains unresolved. The Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) on Thursday categorically announced, after a meeting with the country’s sports advisor and national team cricketers in Dhaka, that under no circumstances would it send the team to India to play matches, while blaming the International Cricket Council (ICC) for denying them “justice”.The entire cricketing world is now waiting for the ICC’s next move. The global governing body had already voted on Wednesday against Bangladesh’s request for a venue shift to co-host Sri Lanka, while issuing a 24-hour ultimatum to the BCB.With the BCB virtually out of the tournament due to its defiant stand, the ICC now has to kickstart its contingency plan for the mega event sooner rather than later. Scotland has emerged as the frontrunner to play the World Cup in place of Bangladesh, with the ICC expected to make it official soon.What began as a controversy has turned into a never-ending drama since Indian Premier League franchise Kolkata Knight Riders were asked by the BCCI to release star Bangladesh pacer Mustafizur Rahman from their squad without any “specific” reason amid growing tensions between the two neighbouring countries.Bangladesh reacted immediately, deciding not to send its team to India for the T20 World Cup, while also banning the broadcast of the IPL in the country.Since then, a tussle between the ICC and the BCB over the venue shift has continued, and with the tournament just around the corner, a final decision is expected soon. Despite standing firm on its refusal to travel to India — where Bangladesh are scheduled to play all three group matches in Kolkata and Mumbai — the BCB has not formally announced its withdrawal from the tournament, leaving room for manoeuvre. However, any change in the ICC’s stance on altering the schedule so close to the event appears unlikely.If Scotland is officially announced as a replacement, would it be unprecedented? No. There have been precedents in past ICC events.An entire team being replaced by another for an ICC event is a rare occurrence, and the last time Bangladesh were involved in such a row was a decade ago, when they hosted the Under-19 World Cup in 2016.Australia withdrew from the ICC U19 World Cup in Bangladesh and were replaced by Ireland. The seeds of the withdrawal were sown a year earlier, when Australia pulled out of a bilateral series citing security concerns. With the situation not improving, Australia decided to stay away from the tournament.Australia’s official line at the time was that the “threat to Australian interests in Bangladesh” remained high. The ICC termed the decision “disappointing” before naming Ireland as the replacement. West Indies went on to win their maiden U19 World Cup title, beating India by five wickets in the final in Dhaka.Replacement of a team happened again at the U19 World Cup in 2022 too. This time, the New Zealand team withdrew due to strict Covid-19 quarantine regulations for minors upon return home. The ICC then brought in Scotland as the replacement team for the tournament held in the Caribbean.Before that, the 2009 T20 World Cup in England also saw a replacement team. The backdrop dated back to the 2003 ODI World Cup co-hosted by South Africa, Zimbabwe and Kenya, where England and New Zealand forfeited matches in Zimbabwe and Kenya respectively due to political and security concerns.In 2009, visa issues and political tensions again put Zimbabwe’s participation in doubt. Eventually, Zimbabwe withdrew with full participation fees, and Scotland were named as the replacement. Pakistan went on to win the tournament, defeating Sri Lanka by eight wickets in the final at Lord’s.","Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) refused to send team to India for T20 World Cup.

Shivam Dube press conference: On Ishan and Surya’s knock & his role with the ball

NEW DELHI: Singer-composer Palash Muchhal has publicly rejected the allegations levelled against him by actor-producer Vidnyan Mane, who has described himself as a childhood friend of Indian cricketer Smriti Mandhana . Mane has accused Muchhal of infidelity and financial wrongdoing, claiming he was duped of more than Rs 40 lakh in connection with an unreleased film project.Responding to the claims, Muchhal issued a statement on social media, strongly denying the accusations. ""In light of the allegations made by Sangli-based Vidnyan Mane on social media, I wish to state that these claims against me are entirely baseless and factually incorrect. They have been made with malicious intent to tarnish my reputation, and they will not go unchallenged. My lawyer, Shreyansh Mithare, is exploring all legal avenues, and this matter will be dealt with strictly through the appropriate legal channels,"" Muchhal wrote.Mane has since filed a formal complaint against Muchhal in Sangli, Maharashtra.In an interview with Hindustan Times, the 34-year-old made sensational claims, alleging that Mandhana and Muchhal’s relationship collapsed following an incident during wedding celebrations in November 2025. “I was at the wedding celebrations (November, 23, 2025) when he was caught red-handed with another woman in bed. Bhayanak scene tha, he was beaten up by the Indian female cricketers.The entire family is chindi chor. I thought he’d get married and settle in Sangli, but it has completely backfired on me.” Mane further claimed that he was introduced to Muchhal by the Mandhana family.Mane also accused the Muchhal family of exerting financial pressure on him over a stalled film project, alleging that he was forced to invest additional money to safeguard his earlier contribution. “When I met his mother (Amita Muchhal) last month, she said the budget to release the movie has now increased to Rs 1.5 crore. They asked me to invest another Rs 10 lakh or I wouldn’t get any money back. They started blackmailing me and threatened to throw me out of the film, thus I was forced to file a complaint,” he said.According to Mane, all communication ceased after the wedding was called off. “After the wedding was called off, the family blocked me from everywhere. I found out that other artistes from the movie had not received payment they were due to receive either. I had heard of directors fleecing producers in the film industry but this is complete theft,” he added.Mane also claimed to be in possession of evidence supporting his allegations. “I have saved all proofs including my chats and phone conversations that I’m willing to share with the police and the media,” he said.Muchhal reiterated his denial through an Instagram story, maintaining that the allegations were false and legally motivated.Mandhana and Muchhal were originally scheduled to get married on November 23, 2025. The wedding was initially postponed due to health-related issues in both families before being officially cancelled in December 2025.Following widespread speculation surrounding the split, both issued separate statements confirming the decision. Smriti said she wanted to “clarify that the wedding is called off” and requested privacy, while Muchhal stated, “I have decided to move on in my life and step back from my personal relationship. Its been very difficult for me to see people react so easily on baseless rumours about something which has been most sacred to me. Its the most difficult phase of my life and I will deal with it gracefully holding on to my beliefs.”","Actor-producer Vidnyan Mane has accused Palash Muchhal of infidelity and financial wrongdoing.

Bangladesh cricket in turmoil: What it means for the T20 World Cup?

Aminul Islam Bulbul has long held a key place in Bangladesh cricket history as the country’s first Test centurion, a milestone he achieved in Bangladesh’s debut Test against India 25 years ago.That achievement remains a proud moment in his career. On Thursday, however, it became clear that another first may now be linked to his tenure, one that carries negative consequences. Bulbul is set to become the first Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) president under whom the national team is likely to pull out of an ICC global tournament. The situation has arisen due to the firm position taken by government sports adviser Asif Nazrul, who has linked security concerns with issues of national prestige.If Bangladesh does not participate in the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup, the country could face major financial losses. The impact would be felt by the BCB, the players, and the tournament’s commercial structure.By taking part in the T20 World Cup, Bangladesh would earn around Bangladeshi Taka 4 crore, or roughly $300,000. A finish among the top 12 teams would raise that amount to over Bangladeshi Taka 5.5 crore, around $450,000.A withdrawal could also result in the BCB losing close to BDT 325 crore, approximately USD 27 million, which it receives annually from the ICC. In addition, broadcast and sponsorship revenues would be affected, with the board’s income for the financial year potentially dropping by nearly 60 percent or more.There could be further consequences, including the possibility of India not touring Bangladesh in August–September. The television rights for that series are considered to be equal to at least 10 bilateral matches involving other teams.Bangladesh is scheduled to hold elections on February 12. Once a new government is formed, Nazrul, who was active during the protests and is linked with Jamaat, may no longer hold influence. However, the fallout from the episode is expected to remain associated with Bulbul’s tenure.In this situation, the players stand to lose the most, as they miss out on the opportunity to compete at a global event.As per a PTI report, Nazrul and Bulbul have assured the players that they will not lose match fees and will be compensated based on the number of games Bangladesh could have played in the tournament.However, for players at the top level, financial compensation alone is not the sole motivation. The chance to compete at the highest stage also holds significant importance.","Aminul Islam Bulbul is set to become the first Bangladesh Cricket Board president under whom the national team is likely to pull out of an ICC global tournament.

2025 Champions Trophy: India refuse to travel to Pakistan

As discussions continue between the Bangladesh Cricket Board and the ICC over Bangladesh’s potential travel to India for the 2026 T20 World Cup amid security concerns, the situation has revived a familiar debate in international cricket. History shows that teams pulling out of ICC events due to political or security reasons is far from unprecedented.Below are notable instances where such decisions shaped major tournaments.In the build-up to the 1996 ODI World Cup, Sri Lanka, one of the co-hosts alongside India and Pakistan , was grappling with a civil war. A bomb blast in Colombo in January, just weeks before the tournament, escalated safety fears.India and Pakistan publicly backed Sri Lanka by sending a combined XI to play a friendly in Colombo. Australia and West Indies, however, refused to play their scheduled group matches in the city and were forced to forfeit points. Despite this, both teams reached the knockout stages, while Sri Lanka went on to win the World Cup, defeating Australia in the final in Lahore.The 2003 ODI World Cup, co-hosted by South Africa, Zimbabwe and Kenya, saw two separate withdrawals.England declined to play in Harare due to opposition from the UK government to the Robert Mugabe regime.New Zealand, citing security concerns after a bombing in Mombasa months earlier, refused to travel to Nairobi to face Kenya.Both boards requested venue changes, but the ICC rejected the appeals and awarded walkovers to Zimbabwe and Kenya. England were eliminated in the first round, while Kenya used the advantage to reach the semi-finals in a landmark campaign.Ahead of the 2009 T20 World Cup in England, strained relations between Zimbabwe and the UK raised doubts over player visas. In July 2008, Zimbabwe and the ICC reached an agreement that led to Zimbabwe withdrawing from the tournament in what was described as the larger interest of the game.Despite pulling out, Zimbabwe received their full participation fee, and Scotland were selected from the qualifiers to take their place.Security concerns once again influenced an ICC event when Australia withdrew from the 2016 Under-19 World Cup in Bangladesh. The decision followed Australia’s earlier cancellation of a bilateral series in the country, citing a continued high threat level to Australian interests.The ICC said it respected Australia’s stance, though expressed disappointment. Ireland replaced Australia in the tournament.The 2025 Champions Trophy was set to be Pakistan’s first ICC tournament in nearly three decades. While Pakistan had travelled to India for the 2023 ODI World Cup, uncertainty remained over whether India would tour Pakistan two years later.Eventually, the BCCI confirmed that India would not travel due to lack of government clearance. After prolonged negotiations, the ICC introduced a neutral venue arrangement for the 2024–2027 cycle. India played their matches in Dubai and went on to win the tournament.As the Bangladesh situation unfolds ahead of the 2026 T20 World Cup, the ICC faces yet another familiar challenge, balancing security concerns, political realities and the integrity of global tournaments.","Bangladesh are in talks with the ICC over their potential travel to India for the 2026 T20 World Cup amid security concerns.

India were under pressure early in the chase of 209 against New Zealand in the second T20I. Both openers were back in the pavilion quickly, with Sanju Samson dismissed for 6 and Abhishek Sharma out for a duck, leaving the hosts in a spot of bother. Ishan Kishan , who had recently made his return to the Indian setup after a prolific domestic season, walked in at No. 3. Given the responsibility at a crucial moment, Kishan responded with fearless intent. He took the attack to the New Zealand bowlers, refusing to let the asking rate dictate terms. His innings of 76 came off just 32 balls and featured 11 fours and four sixes, struck at an imposing rate of 237.50.At the other end, captain Suryakumar Yadav provided calm support before finding his rhythm. The pair stitched together a blazing partnership of 122 runs in 48 balls, swinging the momentum firmly in India’s favour and reshaping the chase.When Ish Sodhi finally ended Kishan’s stay at the crease, the impact of the knock was clear. As Kishan walked back, Suryakumar stepped forward and wrapped him in a hug. It was a simple gesture that reflected appreciation, trust and the value of a player who had grabbed his opportunity.Earlier in the evening, New Zealand had posted 208 for 6 on a good batting surface. Kuldeep Yadav led India’s fightback with two timely wickets in the middle overs after Devon Conway and Tim Seifert had given the visitors a flying start. Rachin Ravindra and skipper Mitchell Santner ensured the total crossed 200, with Santner remaining unbeaten on 47.Yet the moment that lingered came during the chase. A captain’s hug summed up a comeback that had been earned the hard way and delivered when it mattered most.","India were under pressure early in the chase of 209 against New Zealand in the second T20I.

Australia’s injury worries deepened ahead of the T20 World Cup after fast bowler Nathan Ellis suffered a hamstring issue during the ongoing Big Bash League.Ellis, who captains the Hobart Hurricanes, has been ruled out for the remainder of the BBL, a development that has cast doubt over his readiness for the global tournament, scheduled to begin on February 7 across India and Sri Lanka. Hobart’s campaign ended on Friday after they were eliminated by the Sydney Sixers.The setback further complicates Australia’s pace-bowling plans, with Josh Hazlewood and Pat Cummins also dealing with fitness concerns. Hazlewood, who missed the Ashes and has not played since November last year, is expected to be fully fit in time for the World Cup. Cummins, meanwhile, is likely to rejoin the squad later in the tournament.Before his injury, Ellis had been a standout performer for the Hurricanes in the BBL, claiming 14 wickets from nine matches while conceding runs at an economy rate of 9.03.Australia are set to face Pakistan in a three-match T20I series starting January 29, which will act as a key lead-up to the World Cup.

The SA20 Season 4 Qualifier 2 will be a repeat of last season as Sunrisers Eastern Cape and Paarl Royals face off at the Wanderers on Friday evening for a place in Sunday’s coveted final.Sunrisers were comfortable victors at Centurion last season, winning by eight wickets, but the tables have turned this year heading into the all-important clash.Two-time champions Sunrisers must shake off a defeat to Pretoria Capitals in Qualifier 1, while the Royals dismantled Joburg Super Kings in the Eliminator at Centurion on Thursday and will be buzzing with confidence at the Bullring, unlike 12 months ago when the situation was reversed.The Royals’ victory was particularly significant as it was their first SA20 knockout win in five attempts. They also showed strong character by bouncing back after losing to the same JSK side earlier in the week in their final group match.“It was a tough one to take, probably not one we wanted to be playing in the third and fourth playoff after the first eight games,” said Royals all-rounder Asa Tribe.“We thought we could get right into the top two, but we ended up in this position and fought back after a tough loss in the last game.“The momentum is with us. They’re coming off a loss. We’re flying high.”The Royals have also strengthened their squad with West Indies all-rounder Rovman Powell , who could add significant firepower to their middle order.Powell replaces mystery spinner Mujeeb Ur Rahman, who was called up for international duty with Afghanistan.Sunrisers, meanwhile, find themselves in the unfamiliar position of having lost a playoff match, but assistant coach Russell Domingo is confident they can bounce back on Friday evening.“We know the areas we need to get better at, as coaches as well. There are certain things we can do a little differently, so there are good lessons for all of us,” Domingo said.“We know we are a quality side and have played really good cricket. I think all the games we’ve lost have gone down to the last over. We’ve been competitive in all our losses. They’ve all been really close.“So we’re not far off. Nothing drastic, nothing major, just a little bit of tinkering here and there.”The winner of Friday evening’s Qualifier 2 will face Pretoria Capitals in the SA20 Season 4 final at Newlands on Sunday, January 25.","SA20 Season 4 Qualifier 2 will be a repeat of last season.

Awaiting the fans are fast-tracked visas and curated experiences, including road trips to explore the heart of the US, Route 66 being the most famous of them.The US joins Mexico and Canada to host the FIFA World Cup, the games in the US will begin with the hosts taking on Paraguay in a Group D match in Los Angeles on June 12, day after the tournament kicks off in Mexico City. That will set football (soccer for Americans) rolling across 11 cities for the next one month. The Americans, who put American football, baseball and basketball, above the world’s most popular sport are keen to make it the biggest ever spectacle for the millions of fans offering them an unbelievable time.“From New York to Miami to LA and Seattle, it’s quite a diverse list of host cities. I think each of the host cities are excited to put on a great show, and really engage their communities because it is very much about the communities that are hosting as well.The fan fests are going to be a great way to go beyond the stadium into the community. Local food, culture, music, and engaging with local communities as well. It’s hard to describe how exciting it’s going to be. I think it's going to be beyond any of our expectations,” Fred Dixon, president and CEO of Brand USA, told TOI in an exclusive interview.Speaking on the sidelines of the Brand USA Travel Week India held here, Dixon said the authorities also plan to make it easy for the spectators to get the US visa. “If you decide to buy tickets to the World Cup and you don’t have your visa yet, there actually is a way to facilitate that process to identify yourself as a ticket holder, and then the State Department will work to facilitate the visa processing faster for those travelers,” Dixon said.Dixon was particularly excited to welcome the Indians travelling for the World Cup. “In places like New Jersey and New York, places like Atlanta and Dallas, Texas, those are obviously big communities. The communities will come to life through the fan fests and so there will be the official fan fest events for every host city. So you'll be in the communities with the locals or with your friends and the people you're traveling with. With more than 5 million Indians living in the US, seeking out and traveling with or spending time with family and friends will be a big component of that,” Dixon said.On whether there will be any relaxation for the fans from Haiti and Iran, Dixon didn’t have an answer. “You’d have to check with the State Department,” he said.For those millions who get entry into the US and the special ones who get lucky through the draw, FIFA said there were 500 million requests for tickets to watch the matches, the US wanted to wow them. On top of the list are the road trips including the iconic Route 66.“It’s a unique moment as well because it’s the 250th anniversary of America. So you have America, 250 activities happening all across the country as well. The other anniversary that’s happening this year is Route 66. It's the 100th anniversary of the famous highway (opened on Nov 11, 1926) that connects California and Chicago -- from Chicago to Santa Monica. It winds through small, interesting towns all across the west of the US. And so you’re going to see a lot of themes around road trips, that freedom of the open road in America. So I think there will be a lot of curated experiences around road trips,” said Dixon.“In the host cities themselves, you’re going to have lots of curated experiences, whether it relates to museums, art, exhibitions. The travelers are going to benefit from the focus on a lot of Americana, both historical, but also what American brands, I think, have meant to the world. The Fleet Week, which is one of the big celebrations in New York every year in the harbour, has been moved from what is normally in late May. It’s now moving to July 4th. So just imagine the Statue of Liberty with fireworks and all the Navy fleets, you know. It’s expected to have the largest gathering of tall ships in the world for America 250, which will travel up the east coast of the US. So there is an unlimited amount of curated experiences to have,” Dixon added.“At americathebeautiful.com , we actually have AI integration to help with trip inspiration, particularly when you are dealing with an event that is multi-city, multi-date. We know what the group schedule will be, but as teams advance beyond the group, who’s going to the quarterfinals, who’s going to the semifinals, how would you route yourself? The itineraries may be dynamic if you’re following a particular team. And so our new website has an AI component built into it to help with itinerary suggestions and plannings and ideas.“You also can integrate what your passion points are. So if it’s culture, if it’s history and food, it will help give you highlights and ideas for how you can route yourself. It’s not a booking platform, but it's an inspiration platform. We’ve used AI in a way to help tap into really what is the best of America, and then to inspire travelers to travel, you know, far and to travel deep when they're in the US to explore the World cup, specifically,” Dixon signed off.","The US joins Mexico and Canada to host the FIFA World Cup.

Jay Shah’s 2036 Olympic blueprint for India: '8 Medals won’t cut it'

NEW DELHI/KOLKATA: Former India and East Bengal defender Ilyas Pasha died on Thursday after a prolonged illness.He was 61. He is survived by his wife, two daughters, and two sons.The All India Football Federation (AIFF) condoled the death of Pasha, who was one of the best footballers to have come out of Karnataka.A committed and soft-spoken footballer, Pasha carved out a distinguished career in an area of the field that demanded resilience and composure - defence.Primarily operating as a right wing-back, he was renowned for his impeccable sense of timing, calm demeanour, and ability to read the game astutely.Rarely flustered under pressure, Pasha's disciplined positioning and well-judged tackles ensured that opposing left wingers found little joy on his flank, while goalkeepers behind him operated with added confidence.At the international level, Pasha made his senior India debut on January 27, 1987, against Bulgaria in the Nehru Cup at Kozhikode.He went on to earn eight international caps, featuring in two editions of the Nehru Cup (1987 and 1991), the 1991 SAF Games, and the 1992 Asian Cup qualifiers.Pasha began his football journey with Vinayaka Football Club, Vyalikaval, in north Bengaluru, where he also resided.His consistent performances soon earned him a move to Indian Telephone Industries in the mid-1980s, a period that marked his emergence at the national level.From 1987 onwards, he became a regular feature for Karnataka in the Santosh Trophy , representing the state at the tournaments held in Kolkata in 1987, Quilon (now Kollam) in 1988, and Guwahati in 1989.His performance in Guwahati stood out, as Karnataka narrowly missed out on a final berth. He also won two Santosh Trophy titles with Bengal in 1993 and 1995.On the back of his domestic exploits, Pasha was signed by Mohammedan Sporting, where he continued to enhance his reputation, winning the Sait Nagjee Trophy and the Nizam Gold Cup in 1989.He later joined East Bengal, a move that ushered in the most defining phase of his club career. Representing the iconic red and gold from the early 1990s through the end of the decade, Pasha became an integral part of one of the club's most successful eras.He captained East Bengal during the 1993-94 season and was a trusted figure under the late coach Subhas Bhowmick.With the Red and Gold Brigade, he won the Calcutta Football League on five occasions (1991, 1993, 1995, 1996 and 1998), the IFA Shield five times (1990, 1991, 1994, 1995 and 1997), and the Durand Cup four times (1990, 1991, 1993 and 1995).His trophy cabinet also included two Rovers Cups (1990, 1994), the Federation Cup (1996), the historic Wai Wai Cup in Kathmandu (1993), Airlines Trophy titles in 1990, 1992, 1995 and 1997, the Bordoloi Trophy (1992), ATPA Shield (1992), Kalinga Cup (1993), McDowell Trophy (1995, 1997), and the Super Cup in the 1996-97 season.He was also a member of East Bengal's celebrated triple crown-winning side in 1990 and captained the team to its first international title at the Wai Wai Cup in 1993.He also wore the captain's armband when East Bengal registered a sensational 6-2 victory over Iraq's Al Zawraa SC in the 1993-94 Asian Cup Winners' Cup.He got a special Lifetime Achievement Award from East Bengal in 2012.The AIFF said it has joined the Indian football fraternity in mourning the loss of Pasha, a defender of rare composure and consistency, to honour his lasting contributions to the game.In Kolkata, the East Bengal flag was kept at half-mast on the day, while the club's Under-16 team observed a minute's silence before training.Former East Bengal skipper Falguni Dutta, who played alongside Pasha for two years, remembered him fondly. ""I came to know early in the morning. I was shocked.""When I came to the club in 1997, I was a raw talent and he was there to guide me as a mentor. He played in the same position as me, but I never saw any jealousy in him. He was like an elder brother -- a guide and a coach. He inspired us,"" Dutta said.East Bengal Club bid a final farewell to Pasha at his Bengaluru residence.Working committee member Dipten Bose paid his respects, while former players Saravanan, Thomas and Feroz were also present.","Former India and East Bengal defender Ilyas Pasha dies at 61. Pasha was renowned for his impeccable sense of timing, calm demeanour, and ability to read the game astutely.

From Rs 275 crore to bare bones: AIFF faces a tough test to sell ISL broadcast rights,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/news/from-rs-275-crore-to-bare-bones-aiff-faces-a-tough-test-to-sell-isl-broadcast-rights/articleshow/127128213.cms,"With no takers for its first tender, the AIFF is scrambling to find a broadcaster for ISL 2025–26.

AIFF have no bargaining power

Time for recalibration

What does the current RFP say?

Poll What is your opinion on the AIFF's decision to issue a second Request for Proposal for ISL broadcast rights? It's a necessary step for improvement It shows a lack of planning It's too late to make a difference I have no opinion on this

Last week, the All India Football Federation (AIFF) floated a Request for Proposal (RFP) tender looking for a broadcast partner for the 2025-26 Indian Super League (ISL) season. This was the second time in six months that the AIFF had issued such a document as the first version, released in October 2025, demanded an annual minimum guarantee of Rs 37.5 crore. For a variety of reasons, that didn't find any takers.Ever since, Indian football is in a free fall.AIFF's deal with Football Sports Development Limited (FSDL), which had started the ISL in 2014, expired on December 8, 2025. Between AIFF Constitutional changes, court visits, lack of commercial partners and eventual intervention by the Sports Ministry, ISL has taken a massive hit to its credibility, even if it now has a start date in February 14.The fixtures for ISL 2025-26, which have been tucked away in the draft folder for days due to home venues being in shambles, add to the challenge for any prospective broadcast bidder(s).With 91 matches to be played in the upcoming truncated season in a single leg home-and-away format, this race against time only gets trickier with each passing day. The fact that AIFF have not officially appointed an agency to oversee the broadcast bids process doesn't bode well either.In 2021, the BCCI brought in audit, tax and financial advisory consultants KPMG to advise them on the media rights sale for the IPL. The objective was clear: earn 'top dollar.' It resulted in media rights for the IPL going at Rs 48,390.32 crore over five years - a 100 percent jump in value per match.AIFF, which has hardly showcased its competence in the past few months, is alone in this regard. Before FSDL stepped away, the ISL had a broadcast deal worth Rs 550 crore over two seasons with games showcased on linear TV and OTT. At first, ISL matches were broadcast on the Star Sports Network before moving to the Viacom18-owned Sports18/JioCinema.The Rs 275 crore-a-year deal was reportedly a 37.5 percent increase on what Star India, who had a majority stake in the ISL, had been paying in the first 10 years of the competition.This Rs 275 crore funded things such as match production, league marketing, revenue for the clubs and fixed payments to the federation. Despite this, FSDL posted losses of Rs 14.34 crore in FY23, Rs 46.3 crore in FY22, Rs 13.7 crore in FY21 and Rs 27 crore in FY20. The league only turned profitable when operations were scaled down, posting a net profit of Rs 45.2 crore in FY24.Now, in this post-FSDL era, AIFF and, by extension, the ISL clubs have little room to negotiate with any potential bidders. With the ISL set to be played in multiple cities, it adds to the costs involved with only Rs 9.77 crore budgeted for Production and Transmission. In the past, it hovered around Rs 70 crores.It means the quality output of the broadcast will be lower. Instead of multi-camera setups in different parts of the ground, one can expect 3-4 cameras, similar to the I-League coverage where equipment is placed at a high vantage point, behind the goal and near the half-way line.An ISL club official, who spoke to TimesofIndia.com on the condition of anonymity, said that organising the league in multiple cities could dissuade potential bidders. He also reminded that options are limited anyway, as February-March is also the period for the T20 World Cup in India and Sri Lanka, which JioStar will broadcast.The logic is simple: higher viewership means higher sponsorship for clubs and with an inferior product, that Rs 5-6 crore piece of the puzzle is going to take a hit. All clubs are braced for another year of red in their balance sheet. Even though many will cut costs operationally and have reduced player wages, the losses are expected to be three times the normal in the absence of commercial revenue.Like other aspects of the ISL including franchise fees and player salaries, the broadcast rights value also needs to be recalibrated for a healthier future. While this upcoming season can largely be logged as a stop-gap solution-finding exercise, the exercise towards an economically viable product needs to begin now. As ICC and BCCI have found out, mindless pricing of broadcast deals will drive away smaller players in the streaming space. And unlike sports like cricket and kabaddi - whose audience still consumes coverage on linear TV - football's young viewership exists on OTT.Subsequently, if players stay away due to pricing, it will further dwindle AIFF's options. Among the major broadcast players - on linear TV and digital - there are few options outside of JioStar and Sony Sports Network.AIFF's RFP for media rights of the ISL is a 39-page document that lays down the detailed eligibility framework for prospective bidders and specifies the timelines for bids to be submitted, examined and assessed.As per the schedule, the AIFF has fixed January 23 for a pre-bid meeting with interested parties, while any written queries or requests for clarification may be addressed by up to January 27.Bids must be submitted no later than 5:00 pm IST on February 1, with each submission accompanied by a security deposit of Rs. 5 lakh.Eligibility conditions require bidders to be broadcasters or internet operators with a minimum of three years’ operational experience.In addition, bidders must have recorded a net worth of at least Rs. 10 crore in the most recent financial year (2024–25) and an average annual revenue of no less than Rs. 10 crore across the last three completed financial years — 2022–23, 2023–24 and 2024–25.In the case of consortium bids, a maximum of three entities may come together under a special purpose vehicle (SPV). One member must be designated as the ‘Lead member’ and hold at least a 51 percent equity stake in the SPV’s paid-up and subscribed share capital.Each bid will be evaluated in two components — Technical and Financial — carrying weightages of 70 percent and 30 percent respectively. The bidder securing the highest overall score will be awarded the rights for the forthcoming season.","The All India Football Federation (AIFF) floated a Request for Proposal (RFP) tender looking for a broadcast partner for the 2025-26 Indian Super League (ISL) season.

France’s sports minister on Tuesday said the country's government is not considering, as of now, a boycott of the 2026 football World Cup in the United States, despite rising political tensions linked to US President Donald Trump’s remarks on Greenland.""At the moment we are speaking, there is no desire from the ministry to boycott this major, much-anticipated competition,"" sports minister Marina Ferrari told reporters, as cited by news agency Associated Press""That said, I am not prejudging what might happen.""Ferrari said she wants sport to remain separate from politics.""The 2026 World Cup is an extremely important moment for all sports lovers,"" she said.The men’s World Cup is scheduled to begin in June and will be jointly hosted by the United States, Canada and Mexico. However, tensions have grown after Trump expressed interest in taking control of Greenland, a territory linked to Denmark, which is a Nato ally. The remarks have raised concerns about relations between the US and European countries.In France, left-wing lawmaker Eric Coquerel said the idea of a boycott should be discussed.""Seriously, can we really imagine going to play the footie World Cup in a country that attacks its neighbors,' threatens to invade Greenland, undermines international law, wants to torpedo the UN,"" he wrote in a social media post.""The question seriously arises, especially since it is still possible to refocus the event on Mexico and Canada,"" he added.France, who won the men’s World Cup in 1998 and 2018, finished runners-up in the 2022 tournament after losing the final to Argentina.","France’s sports minister on Tuesday said the country's government is not considering, as of now, a boycott of the 2026 football World Cup in the United States.

Kylian Mbappé criticized Real Madrid fans for singling out Vinícius Júnior and booing the star forward in the team's Spanish league match on Saturday.Mbappé said fans are entitled to boo when they are unhappy, but should criticize the whole squad and not specific players.“I understand the fans,” Mbappé said Monday ahead of the team's Champions League game against Monaco on Tuesday.“Before I was a player, I was a young guy who watched football, was critical and gave his opinion. I completely understand the booing, but if they're going to do it, they should boo the whole squad, not just a few players. We're all playing poorly.”Madrid beat Levante 2-0 on Saturday to end a slide in form that included a loss to Barcelona in the final of the Spanish Super Cup in Saudi Arabia last weekend and an embarrassing elimination against second-division club Albacete in the round of 16 of the Copa del Rey on Wednesday.The crowd at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium on Saturday jeered loudly when Vinícius' name was announced before the match against Levante, and again nearly every time the Brazil forward touched the ball.“It's not Vini's fault we're not playing as well as we'd like. The whole squad is to blame,” Mbappé said. “That's the only thing I have to say to the fans. Boo the whole squad. We have to turn the situation around. We're all to blame.We're going to do just that because we're Real Madrid players and there are always moments like this.Mbappé said Vinícius was affected by the boos and said the whole squad had to try to support him.“Vini is a human being,” Mbappé said. “It's normal to be affected when people speak negatively about you. Sometimes it's fair, sometimes it's not. Vini is a fantastic player. He's an incredible man. I'm lucky to know him, and I'm very fond of him. We as a team have to protect him better so he's not in this position of being alone against everyone. We're going to protect him so he can give us his best, because when he's at his best, he's one of the best in the world. ”The fans also booed Jude Bellingham and Federico Valverde on Saturday. The trio was considered by many to be among those who were not behind former coach Xabi Alonso, who was fired following the team's loss to Barcelona in the Spanish Super Cup. Alonso was replaced by former B-team coach Álvaro Arbeloa.Mbappé said he spoke with Alonso after his departure and wished him well.“I had a wonderful relationship with him. I wish him all the best because I liked how he viewed the game,” Mbappé said.“He's a coach who's obsessed with the game and the details, and he knows a lot about modern soccer. It's a decision by the club that we have to respect. Now there's a new coach, and we have to support him. We're going to give it our all to ensure things go well for both Arbeloa and Real Madrid.”Mbappé was among the players telling Alonso that they would not do the guard of honor to Barcelona in the awards ceremony at the Spanish Super Cup, an image many said showed a break between Alonso and the players in the locker room.“I'm not going to play dumb,” Mbappé said. “Of course, things go on. There are a lot of things said that ultimately aren't true. I don't think that's right. Our job is to accept it, but when I have the opportunity to speak out, I do so. We have to keep quiet and do our talking on the pitch.”Mbappé said it “hasn't been an easy week” for Madrid and the match against Monaco could prove to be a turning point.“We have to show our character to change these kinds of circumstances and to get everyone back on side,” he said.“I think the fans are eager to give us their support, but we have to earn it. We have to keep fighting for all the titles, and tomorrow the most important thing is the Champions League. We're going to show as a team that we can compete and that we're ready to win all the titles we have left this season.”Madrid sits in seventh place in the league phase of the Champions League. The club trails Barcelona by a point in the Spanish league.","Kylian Mbappé says Real Madrid fans are entitled to boo when they are unhappy.

Steelers’ interest in Mike McCarthy centers on Team Direction

The Steelers kicked off their head coach search with a move that shook up the rumor mill. Mike McCarthy entered the mix this week, and fans quickly tied his name to one storyline. Aaron Rodgers . The connection feels natural because of their long history in Green Bay. Still, league insiders say Pittsburgh’s interest goes beyond any quarterback reunion.Pittsburgh looks at a roster built to win now. Veterans lead both sides of the ball. The front office wants a coach who can step in and compete right away. That goal drives this search more than any single player.The key update came recently. NFL Network insider Tom Pelissero, on The Rich Eisen Show, addressed Rodgers' talk directly.“I do believe that if Aaron Rodgers were coming back to play for one coach in 2026, it would be Mike McCarthy,” Pelissero said. “But I think people may have misconstrued when I mentioned that on the show the other day as, ‘Well, this is the Steelers trying to lure back Aaron Rodgers.’ That’s not it at all.”Pelissero added more context during the same appearance. “If they hire Mike McCarthy, and that’s not a given, if they hire Mike McCarthy, they are doing it for the totality of what direction they think they can go right now,” Pelissero said.“They’ve got a very, very veteran roster.”The Steelers interviewed McCarthy as they searched for a replacement for Mike Tomlin, who stepped down after the 2025 season. McCarthy brings 18 seasons of head coaching experience with the Packers and Big D. He holds a 174-112-2 career record and won Super Bowl XLV with Green Bay.A-Rod's future remains uncertain. ESPN insider Adam Schefter reported in January 2026 that Rodgers has not committed to retirement or a return to the Steelers. That uncertainty keeps the speculation alive, but Pittsburgh’s front office looks at the full picture.Tomlin left after 19 seasons in charge, ending one of the longest and most stable coaching tenures in NFL history. His exit has left a huge gap in Pittsburgh, and the crew are now carefully evaluating experienced names as they look to reset their direction.The Steelers want leadership, structure, and experience on the sideline.

Tom Brady shares a strong scouting report on Jarrett Stidham before the Patriots clash

The Denver Broncos are one win away from the Super Bowl , but they will try to get there with a quarterback few expected to see in this spot. Recently, Denver confirmed Jarrett Stidham will start the AFC Championship Game after Bo Nix suffered a broken ankle in the divisional round. That injury flipped the script on the Broncos’ playoff run and pushed a longtime backup into the biggest moment of his career.Now comes the twist that makes this story even louder. Stidham faces the New England Patriots, the same franchise where he once backed up Tom Brady. With questions swirling about whether Stidham can handle the pressure, TB-12 stepped in this week with a strong public endorsement that quickly caught national attention.Brady spoke about Stidham while responding to Colin Cowherd’s request for a scouting report during a media appearance earlier this week. The seven-time Super Bowl champion did not hesitate when asked about his former teammate.“I always loved Stiddy. He’s a very natural passer of the football, very competitive, very smart,” Brady said during the segment. He followed that up with another detail that stood out. “He’s got sneaky good athleticism.”GOAT made it clear this was not empty praise. He pointed to Stidham’s past opportunities and the confidence inside the Broncos’ building. “He’s performed well out there when he’s gotten opportunities, and I know that the Denver coaching staff, from the things that I’ve read this week, everybody’s got a tremendous amount of confidence in Stiddy and what he can do,” Brady said. He closed with a warning aimed at doubters. “I wouldn’t sleep on him at all.”Still, Brady also acknowledged the size of the challenge. He noted that Stidham must protect the football against a Patriots defence that allowed just 320 points in the regular season, the fourth-lowest total in the league, and recorded only 71 missed tackles all year. That unit also gave up 25 passing touchdowns, which Sean Payton could try to target with a smart game plan.Stidham has not seen meaningful game action in more than two years. Now he leads a playoff offence as a 4.5-point underdog with a Super Bowl trip on the line. Brady’s words raised eyebrows. Sunday will show whether they were prophecy or just loyalty.","Jarrett Stidham will start the AFC Championship Game after Bo Nix suffered a broken ankle in the divisional round.

Fernando Mendoza and the Raiders connection



Fernando Mendoza did not just lift Indiana to its first national championship. He rewrote his own football story in the process. On Monday night, the Hoosiers stunned the college football world, and by the end of the week, their quarterback stood at the center of the sport’s biggest conversation. With a title secured and his college chapter closed, Mendoza officially declared for the NFL Draft, setting the stage for what many believe is an inevitable rise to the top pick.The timing could not be sharper. Fresh off the championship glow, Mendoza has stepped into the national spotlight, balancing humility with quiet confidence. His recent media appearances were less about celebrating personal accolades and more about signaling readiness for the next challenge. That next step, increasingly, appears to be Las Vegas.As draft chatter grows louder, Mendoza has addressed the possibility of being selected No. 1 overall by the Las Vegas Raiders with calm perspective. “I’d be blessed to play anywhere, and the No. 1 pick is a great blessing, but any pick is a fantastic blessing,” Mendoza said. “You only need one team to believe in you, and any team that believes in me, I’m going to give them my all.""He did not stop there. “The Raiders have a great culture, a great coaching staff, and a great ownership group. It’s all around. Those are legit guys. I’d be happy to end up anywhere.”Those words matter, especially from a quarterback who understands the value of belief. Mendoza began his journey as a lightly recruited prospect at California before transferring to Indiana. From two star labels to Heisman glory, his rise was built on resilience, preparation, and leadership rather than hype.For Las Vegas, the appeal is obvious. The Raiders are searching for stability at the most important position in sports. Pairing Mendoza with weapons like Ashton Jeanty and Brock Bowers could accelerate a long overdue reset. The caveat, of course, is protection. Building a stronger offensive line will be essential if the franchise wants its rookie quarterback to thrive.The league remains driven by quarterbacks, and the Raiders appear poised to finally secure one who fits their timeline. With cap space, draft capital, and a pivotal coaching hire ahead, Las Vegas controls its own narrative. Mendoza, meanwhile, has already shown he can change a program’s direction. Soon, he may be asked to do the same for an entire franchise.","Fernando Mendoza has declared for the NFL Draft, setting the stage for what many believe is an inevitable rise to the top pick. “You only need one team to believe in you, and any team that believes in me, I’m going to give them my all,"" he said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127349424,imgsize-55448,width-400,resizemode-4/fernando-mendoza.jpg"

Drake Maye and the New England Patriots sits one win away from reclaiming a stage the franchise once ruled, and the moment feels bigger than a single season. Sunday’s AFC Championship Game in Denver is not just a matchup. It is a measuring stick for a rebuilt roster, a young quarterback, and an organization chasing relevance after years in the shadows.The Patriots arrive with momentum and belief. A 14–3 regular season erased the memory of three straight playoff misses and reshaped how the league views New England. This is no longer a team clinging to past banners. It is one driven by fresh faces, sharper edges, and a quarterback who has turned patience into production. That quarterback is Drake Maye, a 23-year-old who has accelerated the rebuild faster than anyone expected. In his second season, he has blended poise with aggression, pushing the ball downfield while protecting it. The result is a trip to Colorado with Super Bowl stakes, something the franchise has not tasted since Tom Brady’s final year in 2019.Maye’s season reads like a breakout script. He finished with 4,394 passing yards, 31 touchdowns, and only eight interceptions, numbers that placed him firmly in the MVP conversation.More importantly, he delivered in tight moments. Game-winning drives, red-zone efficiency, and calm decision-making turned a roster many labeled transitional into a legitimate contender.The challenge now stiffens. Denver’s defense is disciplined, physical, and unforgiving, especially at home. The Patriots must execute cleanly, limit mistakes, and stay patient when points are hard to find. Maye’s task is clear. Be steady, protect the football, and make the throws that swing playoff games.There is also an ironic twist. Across the field stands Jarrett Stidham, a former Brady teammate now stepping in for the injured Bo Nix. Different paths, same destination. One quarterback fighting to extend a breakthrough season, the other trying to hold the line.Off the field, the spotlight has widened. Ann Michael Maye has become a fan favorite through her social presence, fashion moments, and a JetBlue partnership that will feature special Patriots cookies on select Boston-to-Denver flights. It is a lighter note, but it reflects how this team has captured attention again.For Maye, Sunday moves the story from promise to proof. Win, and the Patriots return to the Super Bowl in Santa Clara. Lose, and the season still stands as a warning to the league. Either way, a new era has clearly begun.","Drake Maye and the New England Patriots are one win away from reclaiming a stage the franchise once ruled.

Claims circulating on social media allege infidelity involving both Tomlin and his wife, Kiya Tomlin. Neither Tomlin nor the Steelers have publicly addressed the accusations, which remain unconfirmed.

Mike Tomlin controversy deepens as influencer claims secret affairs on both sides

The silence of a dying age in Pittsburgh has assumed a new twist. As Mike Tomlin left the coaching profession almost twenty years later, family and balance were the reason. Weeks afterwards that was a story that was undermined by a flood of internet assertions that caused the nation to stop focusing on football and start paying close attention to intensely personal accusations that were spreading on social media sites.As speculation spread, influencers began sharing unverified accounts that framed Tomlin’s exit in a very different light. None of the claims have been confirmed, but the speed at which they traveled reignited debate about privacy, credibility, and how quickly rumors can reshape a legacy built over years.According to Instagram personality Harold White, Mike Tomlin stepped aside amid allegations of infidelity. White claimed Tomlin had a relationship with a woman described as a “side woman,” who is allegedly pregnant with his child. The allegations quickly gained traction, prompting additional claims from other social media users.TikTok creator Shana, known online as “shanasfamilyshenangians,” expanded on those allegations in a recent video. She claimed Tomlin had been involved with a woman named Nina Pagley for several years.""So allegedly, Mike Tomlin and Nina Pagley have been seeing each other for five years,"" Shana said. ""That Halloween video and photo is from three years ago, and it's because they've been seeing each other for five years. She did end up pregnant. She did have the baby last month, and she did move to Florida, but I heard it was because Tomlin wanted her to move to Florida, because he was leaving the Steelers and taking a broadcaster position somewhere. He purchased her a home back in July of 2024 in Allegheny County West View area on Princeton Avenue.""Shana went further, alleging that Tomlin frequently visits Florida and suggesting frustration among locals over keeping the situation quiet. She then introduced a separate claim involving Tomlin’s wife, Kiya Tomlin.""I also heard that allegedly, Mike Tomlin's wife, Kiya, has someone on the side also,"" Shana said. ""I don't know what's going on with these Tomlins, and I don't understand how this has been kept a secret for five years. But what's even stranger is if he violated a rule of misconduct with the Rooneys, why are they burying this?""Mike Tomlin and Kiya have been married since 1996 and share three children. Neither Tomlin nor the Pittsburgh Steelers organization has addressed the allegations publicly. Until verified information emerges, the claims remain unconfirmed, underscoring how quickly online narratives can challenge even the most stable public careers.","Mike Tomlin is facing renewed online scrutiny after influencers made unverified allegations about his personal life.

An NFL MVP and franchise icon, Brodie spent 17 seasons with San Francisco, setting passing records and earning All Pro honors. He later became a broadcaster and accomplished golfer, leaving a lasting legacy across sports.

NFL MVP and longtime 49ers star John Brodie passes away at 90



The death of a football legend has created a profound silence on the field of San Francisco and the whole NFL. John Brodie was not just another quarter back in another era. He represented the element of consistency, hardness, and faithfulness at the period when the league was yet discovering its current identity. The passing of a 90-year-old player is the end of an era of a player who had an impact that was much more than statistics and box scores.Brodie was the symbol of stability in change to generations of 49ers fans. He performed in the period when Super Bowls were not used to mark legacies, but his presence is imprinted in the history of the franchise. Whenever leadership, longevity, and silent superiority in a crisis are discussed, his name continues to be mentioned. While his death was recently reported, a specific cause was not immediately disclosed, though he had previously overcome a severe stroke in 2000.John Brodie spent his entire 17 year NFL career with the San Francisco 49ers, a franchise record that still stands. The team confirmed he died Friday, with his family noting he had suffered a stroke in 2000. Brodie won the NFL MVP award in 1970 and retired as one of the most productive passers the league had ever seen.“The 49ers family is saddened to learn of the passing of one of the franchise’s all-time great players, John Brodie,” said team co-chairman John York. “As a kid, my 49ers fandom began by watching John play quarterback on television. He displayed an incredible commitment toward his teammates and his support of the organization never wavered after his playing days.“John became a dear friend of mine, and he will always be remembered as an important part of 49ers history. We express our deepest condolences to his wife, Sue, and the entire Brodie family.”Brodie’s numbers still resonate. His 31,548 passing yards rank second in franchise history behind Joe Montana, and his 214 touchdown passes remain third all time for the team. He led the NFL in passing yards three times and earned multiple All Pro honors.Those who played alongside him remember more than stats. “He was a great guy, a super competitor, I don’t care what it was: football, cards, golf,” former teammate Jerry Mertens said. “The guy just did it all, and he was a great leader, there’s no question about that.”After football, Brodie thrived as a broadcaster and elite golfer, even winning on the senior tour. Few athletes have lived so fully in competition. Even fewer left behind a legacy as complete.","John Brodie, the longtime face of the San Francisco 49ers, has died at 90.

While the movie drew major awards attention, backlash followed on social media. The reaction came as her husband, Josh Allen, dealt with injury concerns during a closely watched NFL postseason stretch.

Jason Whitlock sparks debate after criticizing Hailee Steinfeld’s Oscar-nominated film

The crash between Hollywood fame and sports media commentary occurred this week on an even sharper turn following a big Oscars announcement that created an unexpected response. Although the recent nominations of the Academy were hailing the ambitious artistic spirit, the reaction of one vocal sport celebrity soon changed the focus out of controversy instead of acclamation.The debate surfaced just as awards season momentum peaked, placing a high-profile actress and an equally high-profile critic on opposite sides of public opinion. What followed was less about trophies and more about how cultural success is judged outside the film industry.Following the announcement that Sinners had secured a historic 16 Oscar nominations, former ESPN analyst Jason Whitlock shared a blunt assessment on social media. His reaction was immediate and unfiltered.""I'm just seeing Sinners received 16 Oscar nominations. One of the worst movies I've ever seen. Unreal,"" Whitlock tweeted, dismissing the Academy’s praise and igniting online debate.The film stars Hailee Steinfeld opposite Michael B.

The project is now in contention for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Original Screenplay, and multiple acting awards.While the film world weighed Whitlock’s remarks, Steinfeld’s personal life also intersected with major sports news. Her husband, Josh Allen, earned recognition of his own as one of the finalists for the NFL’s 2025 MVP award.The season gave Allen elite positioning. He recorded great passing statistics, has14 rushing touchdowns, and has led Buffalo to an AFC competitive campaign. Despite the Bills losing the divisional round in overtime to Denver, there was always something to talk of under Allen as the leader.The difference between the film industry praise and condemnation is a classic instance of a common truth. Awards are capable of propelling a project to secure a spot overnight, although people are ambivalent.With Oscar voting almost here and MVP arguments raging, both Steinfeld and Allen are dealing with success in entirely different Spotlights, each of them, however, with the price of examination that imposes on them far beyond their areas of expertise.","Hailee Steinfeld's film Sinners received a record 16 Oscar nominations.

Tom Brady admits early TV struggles and reveals the quarterback mindset that reshaped his broadcasting game,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/tom-brady-admits-early-tv-struggles-and-reveals-the-quarterback-mindset-that-reshaped-his-broadcasting-game/articleshow/127286410.cms,"Tom Brady explains how thinking like a quarterback helped him level up as an NFL broadcaster (Getty Images)

Tom Brady embraces the quarterback mindset on television

Tom Brady builds chemistry and confidence in the Fox booth

Tom Brady did not walk into the broadcast booth as a finished product, and he never pretended otherwise. Tom Brady arrived on Fox with unmatched football credentials, but television asked for a different kind of command. Millions tuned in expecting instant brilliance, yet his early broadcasts felt cautious and tightly wound. The knowledge was there, but the delivery lacked the freedom fans associate with the greatest quarterback the NFL has ever seen.Behind the scenes, Brady was relearning how to trust himself in public. He overprepared, filtered his instincts, and tried to sound like a polished analyst instead of the player who once controlled every huddle. That internal tug of war shaped his first season. What followed in Year 2 was not a reinvention, but a return. Brady stopped performing and started playing the game again, just without a helmet.The breakthrough came when Brady stopped thinking like a broadcaster and returned to his roots as a quarterback. He explained that the shift was simple but powerful.“I started to transition this year into, ‘Let me do more of how I did it as a quarterback,’ because that’s really where my comfort is,” Brady told Andrew Marchand.“As opposed to, ‘Let me try to prepare as a broadcaster.’”That mindset changed everything. Brady trimmed the excess, trusted his football instincts, and reacted in real time. He stopped drowning himself in information and started reading games the way he always had, by feel, rhythm, and matchup awareness.“I used to say, ‘All the stuff I prepared, I could read from start to finish in a three-hour broadcast, and I wouldn’t get through all the information,’” Brady said.Letting go unlocked his natural voice. Viewers began hearing the subtle details only a seven time Super Bowl champion could explain. Wind patterns. Pocket movement. Why a play failed before the replay rolled. Brady was no longer reciting. He was diagnosing.Brady credits much of his growth to partnership. His bond with Kevin Burkhardt deepened through honest conversations, shared rounds of golf, and a commitment to making broadcasts feel human. Burkhardt gave Brady space to lead, and Brady embraced the responsibility.“I don’t think it’s kind of like a team — it’s 100 percent a team,” Brady said. “And it’s 100 percent an orchestra.”That teamwork now defines Fox’s top crew. Brady prepares like it is game week, leading film sessions, outlining strategies, and setting the tone. On Sundays, he audibles freely, trusting his reads and his chemistry.“Tom’s the quarterback,” Burkhardt said. “We’re trying to be a good teammate and get open on third down for him.”As the season closes with the NFC Championship Game, Brady sounds relaxed, confident, and fully himself. The training wheels are gone.“The training wheels come off, and then you have to ride slowly,” Brady said.Now, he is riding with purpose, already planning how to get better next year.",Tom Brady says he stopped thinking like a broadcaster and returned to his roots as a quarterback.

Gautam Gambhir press conference: On Kohli, Rohit and dressing room

How Australia celebrated Border-Gavaskar Trophy win in Sydney

NEW DELHI: 151.2 overs or 908 deliveries and 32 wickets — these are the astonishing stats of Player of the Series Jasprit Bumrah in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy. Despite that, Australia regained the Border-Gavaskar Trophy after 10 years. Bumrah's phenomenal performances Down Under, did however, firmly establish him as one of the most reliable workhorses in modern Test cricket.The immense workload Bumrah shouldered throughout the series raises concerns about his physical limits.The 31-year-old pacer bowled over 150 overs, called upon every single day of the tour, either with the ball or bat. His stellar series average of 13.06 and an economy of 2.77 highlight his effectiveness, with best figures of 6/76.During the fifth and final Test in Sydney, anxiety gripped the Indian camp when Bumrah, who had bowled 10 overs and taken two wickets, left the field during the second session with the physio. He later departed the venue in a car, accompanied by the team doctor and BCCI integrity manager, Anshuman Upadhyay.Bumrah didn’t return to bowl in the second innings. Instead, he remained in the dugout, missing out on the action as India lost both the Test and the series.Is the workload catching up with Bumrah?Former India pacer and 1983 World Cup-winner Balwinder Sandhu believes that bowling 15-20 overs in a Test innings should not be a significant challenge for a pacer at the highest level.""Workload? How many overs did he bowl? 150-something, right? But in how many matches or innings? Five matches or nine innings, correct? That comes down to 16 overs per innings or 30 overs per match. And he didn’t bowl those 15-plus overs in one go. He bowled in spells. So, is it a big deal? Workload management is bull****. These are Australian terms, created by Australians. Workload management is nothing. I don’t agree with this. I come from an era when cricketers used to listen to their bodies and no one else. I don’t agree with this at all,"" Sandhu told TimesofIndia.com in an exclusive interview.""Bowling 15 overs in a day, and that too in different spells, is not a big deal for a bowler. You’re not bowling on all five days of a Test match. He took three or four spells to bowl those overs. Today, you have the best physios, the best masseurs, and excellent doctors to take care of your body. If a bowler can’t bowl 20 overs in an innings, he should forget about playing for India.If you want to represent India, you should have the strength to bowl at least 20 overs in an innings. If you can’t, then it’s better to go back and play T20s, where you only need to bowl four overs. Even those four overs are bowled in three spells,"" he said.""We used to bowl 25–30 overs in a day. Kapil (Dev) has bowled long spells throughout his career. Your body and muscles get conditioned when you bowl, bowl, and bowl. So, I don’t agree with this workload management concept,"" the former pacer said.","Jasprit Bumrah was named Player of the Series in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy.

How Australia celebrated Border-Gavaskar Trophy win in Sydney

SYDNEY: There is no way to sugarcoat this. The long Australian summer has broken Indian cricket's back. The team now needs to spend time in the infirmary before the next big challenge, the five Test series in England in the middle of the year.What would have been a celebration of a wonderful series which drew record crowds now needs to be a dissection of India's failings. For Rohit Sharma 's men, this has been a series of missteps, one bigger than the other. Any introspection must feature some key considerations. Most of them revolve around team composition and dressing-room atmosphere.One is whether the team paid the price for its conservative approach of lengthening the batting order by including allrounders. The second is whether that decision was prompted by the desire to safeguard the spots of some spent forces.The third is owning responsibility for the decision to bowl Jasprit Bumrah to the ground by consistently denying him the support of a frontline fourth pacer in seaming conditions.Over-reliance on Bumrah led to his breakdown in Sydney, preventing him from playing a part as India failed to draw the series. Was it merely wishful thinking that Bumrah would pull through, or was a more scientific assessment made of his increasing workload through the series?That brings us to the role of the backroom staff, and whether new head coach Gautam Gambhir and his support personnel did enough to quell the chaos as panic and confusion set in the ranks following the MCG defeat.That last bit is important because Australia skipper Pat Cummins, whose team resembled India in many ways at the start of the series - a bevy of senior players, two main batters facing prolonged run drought, talk of transitioning to the younger lot - said staying calm after defeat in the first Test in Perth had played a big role in their success.""When you start a series behind, a lot of things get questioned, fairly or unfairly. It shows the strength of the group to stay strong, know that we weren't at our best but can get better, know we won't get caught up in the external noise and clutter, and just focus on what makes us good players and a good team,"" Cummins said here after Australia reclaimed the Border-Gavaskar Trophy after a decade. ""More than what you change, it's about what you don't change.""In contrast, as rumours swirled around captain Rohit dropped for the fifth Test, the team management added to the intrigue by refusing to make things official. What happened off the field seemed to affect India on it.The team was flying high after Perth on the form of Bumrah, a generational talent with the uncanny ability to peak at the right moments. It was the return of their regular captain from paternal leave that seemed to upset the balance of the XI.Some baffling decisions were made, all to goad Rohit into regaining some sort of form. KL Rahul was retained as opener, shuffled to No. 3 and shifted back again once Rohit realized in Sydney that runs had deserted him.Shubman Gill's overseas record is poor, but he had got starts in Adelaide before being unceremoniously dropped in Melbourne as Rohit decided to reclaim his opening slot.There were other strange decisions, like playing two spinners on the Sydney green top, the most difficult batting surface in the series. Why wasn't a fourth frontline seamer or even a regular batter picked in place of Washington Sundar?With Bumrah unavailable, the end result was that Prasidh Krishna and Mohammed Siraj bowled 24 of the 27 overs as Australia cantered to the 162-run target.Nitish Reddy as fourth seamer was another contentious choice. His gentle medium-pace let off the pressure on the Aussie batters and ensured the main seamers didn't get enough breaks. The other bowling options were spinners, in Ashwin, Jadeja and Sundar, and were of little use on these pacy surfaces.At times, the team composition even seemed T20 driven, no surprise given that the coach and captain's credentials stem from T20 success.Asked after the Melbourne defeat if he was happy to pack his side with batting allrounders instead of another frontline seamer, Rohit said, ""Akash (Deep) and Siraj are the frontline seamers (to support Bumrah). It's just that they've been very unfortunate not to be seen on the wickets column. These are the three frontline seamers and whoever plays needs to get the job done for the team.""Reddy's momentous century at No. 8 at the MCG was an immediate pointer to the poor form of stalwarts Virat Kohli and Rohit up the order. Both came to Australia hoping to tide over what seemed like terminal decline. Both failed in spectacular fashion.Kohli's weaknesses outside off-stump and technical failings eventually made him a walking wicket after a strong start in Perth, where he got to face the old Kookaburra ball and scored a century.Kohli now averages 32.29 from his last 40 Tests, 22.47 in 2024, and 23.75 from these five Tests Down Under. All eight of his dismissals were identical, caught behind on the off side, trying to drive deliveries on the fifth or sixth stump line. Scott Boland got him four times, making for one those nice subplots which lit up the series.Surely there is something more going on with Kohli than a temporary dip in form? It could be slowing reflexes or ageing eyesight. It doesn't seem like it is a loss of focus, given the extraordinary effort Kohli has put in the nets across these five Tests here. What should Team India do with its biggest brand and batting talisman? Shouldn't his Test place be up for debate? Are the stars taking their places for granted?As for Rohit, he is a lesser Test batsman than Kohli but an important one, nevertheless. His entire season has been a horror run and that affected his captaincy too. He dropped himself in the fifth Test to save face and his return cannot be dependent on white-ball form.""Not a lot of people are playing for the first time in Australia, probably two in the top eight,"" Gambhir said. ""(Other than) Nitish (Reddy) and Yashasvi (Jaiswal), all the others have the experience of Australia. I'm not going to say it is only because some of the young guys (that India lost). There are a lot of experienced players as well,"" Gambhir said.Even if the team management and selectors are in a hurry to see the backs of Kohli and Rohit, where are the replacements? Can Reddy be a regular Test No. 4? Can KL Rahul, and if so, who opens with Jaiswal?Where are the new breed of Test pacers to support Bumrah? Can Bumrah, given his injury breakdowns and workload-management necessities, take on regular captaincy duties?This was the shortest-ever five-Test series played in a century, lasting 7,664 balls. How much did India's batting failures contribute to that? It's all right saying players must return to domestic cricket, like Gambhir did after the Sydney defeat, but the watered-down standards of tournaments like the Ranji Trophy are unlikely to be of much help.""Ultimately, it is neither my team nor your team, it's the country's team. There are very honest players in our dressing room who know how hungry they are, and how the Indian team (can) go ahead with their contributions. As far as my question is concerned, my biggest responsibility is that I have to be fair to everyone, not only one or two individuals,"" Gambhir said.Known as a confrontational character in his playing days, Gambhir knows his own job is under the scanner, given India's poor record since he took over.Questions are being raised why the assistant coaches need to be changed with every new head coach.Gambhir's role may have started with talk of transition, but it will eventually need to move on to identifying and nurturing top talent. England will be a stern test.",India failed to draw the series against Australia after losing the fifth Test. India paid a heavy price for its conservative approach of lengthening the batting line-up. Over-reliance on Jasprit Bumrah led to his breakdown in Sydney.

Sam Konstas horoscope: 'He will be like Rishabh Pant and Yuvraj Singh'

When India head coach Gautam Gambhir lost his cool in Australia

The astrological analysis of Australia's latest Test player Sam Konstas by Greenstone Lobo on 'StarPlay: Cricket & Astrology ' indicates that the opening batter can go on to become one of the greats of Australian cricket.Konstas made his debut in the Boxing Day Test of the 2024-25 Border Gavaskar Trophy after another youngster Nathan McSweeney failed to deliver in the first three matches of the series.Looking for someone to partner Usman Khawaja at the top after the retirement of David Warner, Australia put their faith in Konstas for the last two matches and he repaid that with a stroke-filled 60 off 65 balls on debut. En route that knock, he stunned Jasprit Bumrah by hitting him for a six and a four off ramp shots.Konstas irritated the Indian team with his aggressive approach, which led to many verbal duels between him and the Indian players, particularly Virat Kohli and Bumrah, before the series ended 1-3 in favour of Australia.Giving details about what the future has in store for Konstas according to his horoscope, Lobo said, ""Sam is a combination of Leo and Virgo, more a Leo; and Leos love to play these audacious shots, which shocks people, mesmerizes them and makes them leap in joy. So the ramp shot and the gallery shots is something you would love to do.""Lobo said that Konstas has traits similar to Rishabh Pant and Yuvraj Singh.""This is somewhere similar to what Rishabh Pant does. Pant also has something in Leo and even Yuvraj Singh. All of these players play these audacious shots to stun people. So he's going to be doing that forever, that is his playing style,"" he said.""But together with that, Sam is also a Virgo. He has his sun in Mercury and Virgo, which makes him a perfectionist. What it means is that all of those shots he plays, they are pure talent. They are not manufactured or agricultural shots. He plays those shots with perfection, perfecting them 100 times.""So the combination is lethal. He is a perfectionist with audacity,"" he added.Lobo said that Konstas's stars suggest that he has the potential to replace Warner.""He can even go on to be a great of the game. Konstas is not a two-Test wonder or five-Test wonder. He is going to play for many, many years to come...He can even go on to replace David Warner.""",Astrological analysis of Australia's latest Test player Sam Konstas by Greenstone Lobo on 'StarPlay: Cricket & Astrology'indicates that the opening batter can go on to become one of the greats of Australian cricket.

NEW DELHI: Desert Vipers all-rounder Dhruv Parashar is eager to make his mark in the upcoming International League T20 ( ILT20 ), which kicks off on January 11 in Dubai.

""I enjoy bowling both in the power plays and outside. It’s different skill sets I need to use, but I enjoy both. It is hard, especially in T20s, as you know the batters are going to come at you. You’ve got to be ready for that, just try to bowl to your strengths, and keep it simple,"" he explained.Dhruv views the ILT20 as a highly competitive platform. ""In ILT20, there are players from all over the world, from all the Test-playing nations. All the top players come and play here.

Gautam Gambhir press conference: On Kohli, Rohit and dressing room

NEW DELHI: Following India's 3-1 Border-Gavaskar Trophy defeat to Australia, Yograj Singh , father of legendary Yuvraj Singh , offered his analysis of the senior Indian batters' performance struggles. Yograj particularly noted Virat Kohli 's dismissals, suggesting the need for proper guidance regarding shot selection.Kohli scored only 190 runs across five Tests, with eight dismissals whilst chasing deliveries outside off-stump. Rohit, absent from the Perth Test due to his second child's birth, scored merely 31 runs in three Tests before opting to rest for the Sydney Test.Yograj emphasised that whilst India's players might not require conventional coaching, they need effective man-management to enhance their performance.""The role of a coach becomes a significant question when you are playing for India. When you're an exceptional player representing India, you might not necessarily need coaching in the traditional sense. What you truly need is someone for man management. Sometimes, a player's mind gets blocked; they might not be scoring runs, or they keep getting out. No matter how great a player is, they can't be bigger than the game itself,"" Yograj said.""Such players need someone to guide them, to say, 'Let's go to the nets and work on this.' For example, Virat Kohli got out many times playing his favourite shot - the right-hand push. That shot works on Indian pitches, in England, and elsewhere. But on certain pitches where the ball bounces and carries more, someone should have told him, 'Virat, don't play this shot.' Just play straight or leave this ball.""This illustrates the difference between coaching and management. Identifying and pointing out a player's technical fault is coaching. Someone needs to recognise and convey these technical issues to the players. But who will tell Rohit Sharma or Virat Kohli? Even they want someone to come and tell them what's going wrong,"" he added.""I believe what's needed is proper management - someone who understands when a player's mind is blocked, when they're feeling low, and reassures them, saying, 'Don't worry, we're here for you. You'll do it because you're a great player.' Every player faces a downfall, even the greatest ones. It's part of the game,"" he continued.Regarding head coach Gautam Gambhir 's approach, Yograj noted, ""Gambhir is a brilliant cricketer with a brilliant mind. He has the ability to guide the team forward. However, where there's a mistake, he points it out - and rightly so. But to hold the younger players together, proper management is essential.""""Someone needs to tell them, 'Virat, it's no big deal; it happens to everyone.' 'Rohit, don't worry, these phases come and go.' 'Bumrah, you're doing great; just stay focused.' The younger players, especially fast bowlers like Siraj, need to be guided and supported. Someone should stand with them, show them the way, and help them understand the nuances of the game,"" he further said.""When players are down, struggling to perform, management becomes that magic wand that lifts them up,"" Yograj concluded.Following their six-wicket defeat in Sydney, India failed to secure a position in the 2025 World Test Championship final, with Australia set to face South Africa at Lord's for their potential second consecutive title.","Yograj Singh says India's players need effective man-management to enhance their performance.

Gautam Gambhir press conference: On Kohli, Rohit and dressing room

NEW DELHI: The Border-Gavaskar Trophy series between India and Australia drew unprecedented attendance, leading former Australia captain Ricky Ponting to assert that the rivalry is arguably the biggest in world cricket.Traditionally, the England-Australia Ashes rivalry held this status, but the five-Test series saw a record 8,37,879 spectators. Melbourne Cricket Ground alone hosted 3,73,691 fans across five days, surpassing the 1937 record of 3,50,534.Ponting, astonished by the numbers, emphasised the fan-driven intensity of the rivalry.“I had a look at the numbers yesterday, it was something like 837,000 people came to watch the Test matches, which is unheard of here in Australia,” Ponting told The ICC Review. “So now that this series has happened, Australia have England coming out next summer so we'll get a better idea then. If the numbers aren't the same, then there'll be no doubt that the (Border-Gavaskar) rivalry (is bigger), certainly from the fans’ point of view.“There's two separate parts to this: There's what the fans want to see and the rivalry that they want to make of it, but it's also how the players view the rivalry between the three teams now.”Former India head coach Ravi Shastri praised the spectators for elevating the bar for Test cricket. “One stat stands out: 3,75,000 people coming through the gates in that Melbourne Test match, beating the record set 90 years ago of 3,50,000. (In) 1936/1937, when the ‘G’ could hold 120,000 people and when Bradman was playing. It just goes to show the sudden interest in the modern era. The bar has been raised. The bar has been raised big time,"" he said.“For people to get out there and watch cricket when there is television, when there are OTT platforms, where all that is there, still for 375,000 people to come (to Melbourne) and then replicate that in Sydney with full houses, it’s unreal,” Shastri added.Ponting echoed Shastri’s sentiments, crediting the series' narrative for drawing global attention.“The fans, understanding how good these two cricket teams are, want to be there and want to be part of it and want to see Test Match Cricket at its absolute best,” he said. “Right now, it's really hard to argue that this isn't the biggest rivalry in world cricket. It's grown. Year-on-year, and Ravi (Shastri) and I have been a part of most of these for the last 15, 20 years. We've felt how it's been growing and growing and the rivalry gets bigger and now the fans are into it as well,"" Ponting added.The series concluded with Australia reclaiming the trophy after a decade and securing a spot in the World Test Championship (WTC) Final. Ponting lauded Australia's resilience, particularly in Melbourne and Sydney, where they outperformed India in challenging conditions.Shastri also praised Pat Cummins ’ leadership and determination.“He (Cummins) amazes me. Even when I was the coach in the dressing room, I would just admire his determination, and his willingness to compete. He never gives up and it's like that session after session – he'll come at you with the ball,” Shastri said.“And just when the chips were down, various times in the series, he rose to the occasion. And not just with the ball, but with the bat as well.”","The Border-Gavaskar Trophy series between India and Australia drew unprecedented attendance.

The Sydney Pink Test , focusing on cancer awareness, carries deep meaning for Australian cricketer Sam Konstas , who has experienced the impact of cancer within his family.The Pink Test tradition began in 2009, honouring Glenn McGrath 's late wife Jane, who lost her battle with breast cancer in 2008. The McGrath Foundation has since raised millions of dollars for the cause.Konstas shared his personal connection to cancer during a Triple M cricket interview. He spoke about the loss of his cousin to leukemia and his grandfather to bowel cancer. He expressed his desire for the SCG match to continue raising cancer awareness.""Obviously it's a special event, the McGrath Foundation, and hopefully we spread more awareness for cancer, get the funds in, because I remember my cousin passed away with leukaemia and my grandpa with bowel cancer.""So obviously we hope we spread awareness and get the cure,"" Konstas said.Konstas was involved in an on-field exchange with Indian captain Jasprit Bumrah. This happened during the fifth Test match. The incident, however, didn't seem to affect the young batter.The confrontation arose when Konstas approached Bumrah. Bumrah was expressing frustration over Usman Khawaja 's perceived delay in taking guard. The umpires intervened to de-escalate the situation. Bumrah subsequently dismissed Khawaja with the last ball of the day and gave Konstas a send-off.Konstas downplayed the incident and acknowledged Bumrah's skill. He also took some responsibility for the situation.""Oh, I didn't get too fazed. Unfortunately, Uzi got out. He was trying to buy some time a little bit. It was probably my fault, but it happens. It's cricket,"" Konstas said.""Credit to Bumrah. He got the wicket, but obviously great performance from the team.""Konstas was asked about his on-field demeanour. He simply stated his intention to give his best and acknowledged that he might sometimes get on his opponents' nerves.""Don't know. Whatever's on the field, I just try to do my best and, yeah, I guess I got a few nerves on the other team.""Konstas enjoyed a dream debut during the Boxing Day Test at the MCG, showcasing his flair with a daring 60 off 65 balls, including a bold battle against Bumrah, in front of a nearly packed stadium.The home team dominated the match, securing a commanding 184-run victory. They followed it up with a six-wicket win at the SCG, clinching the five-match series 3-1 and ending a 10-year wait for triumph against India.""Yeah, it's been quite special. Obviously Mark Taylor presenting my bag and to top it off with the win today was, yeah, outstanding from the team,"" he said.""I don't think it's kicked in yet, but hopefully in the next few days we'll soak up, reflect on it, but it's been awesome.""The team's been outstanding to me and just letting me play my natural game. Pat Cummins is a great leader and hopefully we can keep going on.""The series defeat dashed India's hopes of reaching the World Test Championship (WTC) final, paving the way for Australia to set up a summit clash with South Africa.Asked if he was feeling nervous before his debut, Konstas said, ""No, I was very calm. I was talking to my parents and all my teammates.""But obviously, it was a packed stadium and Uzi (Khawaja) said my journal was pumped when I was batting, but I didn't feel that, but obviously it was a good debut and glad to get two wins.""After impressing against India, Konstas is expected to be included in the squad for the upcoming Sri Lanka tour.When asked if the fans would see the same Konstas, he said, ""Yeah, I'm not too sure if I'm selected yet. I think we'll find out in the next few days, but obviously adapting to different conditions, maybe we'll find a new Sam, but I think so, but time will tell.""",Australian cricketer Sam Konstas has experienced the impact of cancer within his family.

Gautam Gambhir press conference: On Kohli, Rohit and dressing room

NEW DELHI: Former England captain Michael Vaughan shared his analysis on the Border-Gavaskar Trophy , noting that Team India lost their way following their initial victory against Australia at Perth.The Indian team's promising start with a historic Perth win couldn't be maintained as they ultimately succumbed to a 1-3 series defeat. This victory marked Australia's first Border-Gavaskar Trophy success since their 2014-15 campaign. Virat Kohli 's performance was particularly underwhelming, as the senior batter accumulated only 190 runs across eight innings at a modest average of 23.75, with Scott Boland emerging as his frequent nemesis, dismissing him four times.In his appearance on the Club Prairie Fire Podcast, Vaughan acknowledged the high quality of cricket displayed throughout the series, while pointing out Australia's dominance in the final three matches.""India win the first game in Perth, played great. Since then, they've been blown away, really... You've got to say this series, as much as it's been brilliant cricket, a lot of it, particularly the last three games, has been very one-sided. Australia has managed to get the upper hand and play some great cricket and India have not been able to find a way of throwing a punch back. They've thrown a shoulder barge back, but they haven't been able to throw a punch back,"" Vaughan said.In the final Test at Sydney, India's decision to bat first after winning the toss proved costly. The Indian batting lineup delivered a sub-par show. Australia established control from the beginning, with Scott Boland's impressive bowling spells and newcomer Beau Webster 's excellent batting display.Australia, requiring 162 runs for victory on Day 3, achieved their target with four wickets in hand, securing a convincing win in the fifth and final Test match.","India lost 1-3 to Australia in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy series.

The little one stole the spotlight as he toddled into the room.Cummins, beaming with pride, briefly paused to interact with his son, creating a wholesome moment that highlighted the human side of cricket beyond the competition.Reflecting on the 3-1 series win, after beating India by six wickets at Sydney, Cummins said the team felt very privileged over winning the series on their home soil.""It's unreal. It is the one that a few of us didn't have. The boys have had their eye on it and it has lived up to the hype. We were just clear with the plans. Wanted to minimise the runs. We knew it was going to be a tricky wicket. The batters had a good method. Ultimately it worked out.""Immensely proud. We have spent a lot of time as a group. Perth was not as bad as it seems. We have had a lot of fun along the way. Some success along the way is always nice. We feel so privileged to have achieved what we have. It's such a special group. Really proud with what we've been able to achieve and hopefully having the best time of our lives as we're doing it all together,"" said Cummins.Cummins, who has been part of a T20 World Cup-winning squad, triumphed in the 50-over World Cup, claimed the World Test Championship mace, led Australia to Ashes glory, and recently secured a series win in India that his predecessor Tim Paine had lost twice, remains at the peak of his career as skipper.When questioned about a succession plan, Cummins tactfully sidestepped the topic, leaving the future of Australia's captaincy an open-ended discussion.""First of all I just absolutely love what I do. So, I mean that's probably the biggest driver in wanting to play Test Cricket and work with this team and support staff.""So does he feel that he has done it all?""Unfortunately, I have got to keep playing. We'll stay on this side guys and then we'll come over here,"" he smiled and everyone laughed.","Pat Cummins' son, Albie, makes surprise appearance at post-match press conference.

Star midfielder Luka Modric scored as Spanish giants Real Madrid thrashed Deportivo Minera 5-0 to storm their way to the pre-quarterfinals of the Copa del Rey on Monday.Spain 's 'five star' show came via goals from Federico Valverde, Eduardo Camavinga and Arda Guler in the first half. The fourth strikes came in the second half from Modric before Guler completed his brace to seal the scoreline.Madrid introduced strikers Kylian Mbappe and Vinicius Junior only in the second half, as manager Carlo Ancelotti rested them in view of the Spanish Super Cup commencing in Saudi Arabia later this week.The match's early momentum was established when Valverde struck a volley at the far post, followed by Camavinga's header after 13 minutes to extend the advantage.Endrick nearly secured a third goal for Los Blancos, followed by Guler's successful strike, which deflected in after he moved inwards from the right wing.Early in the second period, Brahim Diaz struck the woodwork before veteran Modric, aged 39, scored with an elegant curling shot.In the final moments, Guler converted smoothly after receiving a setup from Fran Garcia, completing an impressive performance by the Turkish midfielder.Barcelona and Atletico Madrid progressed to the subsequent round on Saturday, whilst Athletic Bilbao, the current champions, narrowly advanced via penalties against third-tier Logrones.","Real Madrid thrash Deportivo Minera 5-0 in Copa del Rey.

We haven't achieved anything yet, we need to work until the end and this can lead us to good moments,"" said Espirito Santo.Gibbs-White savoured his return to the club where he spent the early part of his career.In front of the watching new England manager Thomas Tuchel, the midfielder did his case for further international recognition no harm with a cool finish from Antony Elanga's pass.Forest's unexpected rise from battling relegation until the final day of last season into Champions League contenders has been build on a solid defence and Wood's purple patch.The New Zealand international turned in Callum Hudson-Odoi's low cross for his 12th goal of the season to double the visitors' lead just before half-time.Wolves pressed and probed for a way back into the game after the break but were toothless in the absence of talisman Matheus Cunha through suspension.Mats Sels was forced into one brilliant save to deny Jorgen Strand Larsen to preserve a ninth clean sheet of the season and fourth in a row.That solidity is familiar to Wolves fans from Espirito Santo's time in charge of their club between 2017 and 2021.The Portuguese coach led Wanderers from the Championship into Europe for the first time in 39 years.Now after troubled spells at Tottenham and Saudi club Al-Ittihad, he is recreating that magic to leave Forest fans in dreamland.""As coaching staff we have this natural ambition of improving the players, this is what we are obsessed with,"" he added.""If we improve the players then the team will improve and if the team improves then the club will improve and the city will be happy.""",Nottingham Forest beat Wolves 3-0 at Molineux on Monday night.

Liverpool skipper Virgil van Dijk has come to the defence of Trent Alexander-Arnold following his subpar performance against Manchester United , dismissing claims that Real Madrid 's interest has affected his colleague's form.Alexander-Arnold's performance fell short during Sunday's 2-2 draw at Anfield , where he was responsible for Lisandro Martinez's opening goal.The full-back's underwhelming display coincides with ongoing discussions about his future with the Premier League frontrunners.With his contract set to expire at the season's end, he is now eligible to negotiate with foreign clubs for a pre-contract arrangement.Reports indicate that Real Madrid have made an offer for his services, which Liverpool have apparently turned down.Following Sunday's match, former United captain Roy Keane criticised Alexander-Arnold's performance harshly.""There's talk about him going to Real Madrid -- the way he's defending he's going to Tranmere Rovers after this. He's got to do better,"" Keane told Sky Sports.""We talk about how brilliant Trent is going forward, but Trent's defending today. My goodness, it's like schoolboy stuff.""Tranmere, competing in League Two, responded humorously to Keane's comment.They shared an image of their defender Cameron Norman on X, stating: ""Trent to Tranmere Roy? Nah, we're alright thanks"".Gary Neville , previously United's right-back, suggested the Real Madrid speculation might have unsettled Alexander-Arnold.""The supposed bid from Real Madrid is bad timing for him,"" he said. ""I think that will have unnerved him. Real Madrid are such a powerful club.""There are three reasons for that performance -- he has played like this before, he just had a bad game, or his mind was affected by all the talk.""I thought his passing and forward play was the worst I've seen.""While Liverpool remain hopeful of securing Alexander-Arnold's future, he could depart without a transfer fee when his contract expires.Van Dijk, whose own contract expires this season, believes his teammate can handle the situation whilst Liverpool pursue multiple trophies.Liverpool travel to London on Wednesday for their League Cup semi-final first leg against Tottenham.""I am fine with it. Trent has his own people around him, his family and we are there as well,"" Van Dijk said.""He wants to perform in the best way possible like we all do. That is the main focus.""In my opinion, maybe ask him, that is the distraction... the game.""",Virgil van Dijk defends Trent Alexander-Arnold following his performance against Manchester United.

NEW DELHI: In a dramatic 2-2 draw at Anfield on Sunday, Manchester United came back to end a four-game losing streak and stop Liverpool's run at the Premier League title.With one game remaining, Liverpool leads second-place Arsenal by six points at the top of the league.However, Arne Slot's team lost this chance after rallying from behind to take a 2-1 lead thanks to goals from Cody Gakpo and Mohamed Salah Amad Diallo tied the score on the 80th minute to give United the point they so richly deserved after breaking their six-year goal drought at Anfield with a superb opening strike from Lisandro Martinez.The Red Devils are now seven points above the relegation zone and in 13th place in the standings.Prior to the match, Liverpool manager Slot warned that United was ""much better"" than their startling league place indicated, and it turned out to be true.In Monday's dreadful 2-0 loss to Newcastle, United was sliced open at will, prompting manager Ruben Amorim to declare the team in a relegation fight.The return of Manuel Ugarte and captain Bruno Fernandes from suspension, as well as Kobbie Mainoo to the starting lineup, strengthened Amorim's hand.Although the Portuguese's strategy of frustrating Liverpool was successful, the home team did have early opportunities to break through.Gakpo poked past the far post after a through pass from Ryan Gravenberch.Shortly after, Salah found Alexis Mac Allister with a sumptuous pass that the Argentine snatched up and caused Andre Onana to make a wonderful physical save.United should have been ahead before halftime, but it took some time for them to establish themselves as an attacking danger.With the goal gaping from Diogo Dalot's cross, Diallo made a mistake with his header.After racing in behind the Liverpool defense, Rasmus Hojlund had the finest opportunity of the first half, but he was unable to defeat Alisson Becker.However, United players who had been dejected in recent weeks were suddenly regaining their confidence.The visitors' breakthrough came from an unexpected source as Martinez scored his second goal for the team with a blazing hit that landed off the underside of the bar, teaching his strikers how to finish.The league leaders were momentarily in disarray, and the Anfield crowd was starting to grow restless.But Liverpool's breadth of weaponry is largely responsible for their top-of-the-table standing.They had a forward who was in form to come up with the magic moment needed to change the game, even on a quiet day for Salah.At the hour, Gakpo scored his 10th goal in 15 games by turning inside his Dutch international teammate Matthijs de Ligt and blasting high beyond Onana.Slot made two forward substitutions right away after the equalizer, introducing Darwin Nunez and Diogo Jota, and he was rewarded for it.With a VAR review, a spot-kick was awarded when MacAllister's header brushed off De Ligt's outstretched arm within the penalty area.Salah scored his 18th Premier League goal in 19 games with a low, powerful smash past Onana.But United's strong performance earned the point it deserved, ending Amorim's worrying losing run so early in his tenure.Alejandro Garnacho's new manager has questioned his temperament, but the Argentine came off the bench to equalize when Diallo turned in his low cross.And with the goal gaping deep into stoppage time, Harry Maguire should have made it even better for United by spooning a pass from Joshua Zirkzee over the bar.",Manchester United came back from 2-1 down to draw 2-2 with Liverpool. Goals from Cody Gakpo and Mohamed Salah Amad Diallo equalized for Red Devils.

City turned corner?

Arsenal blew a chance to make up significant ground on Premier League leaders Liverpool on Saturday with a frustrating draw at Brighton as Manchester City pummelled West Ham 4-1.In-form Newcastle inflicted another painful defeat on Ange Postecoglou's struggling Tottenham and Chelsea's recent woes continued with a 1-1 draw at Crystal Palace.Mikel Arteta's Arsenal, Premier League runners-up over the past two seasons, travelled to the south coast hunting a fourth straight league win in the evening kick-off.Seventeen-year-old Ethan Nwaneri, in for the injured Bukayo Saka, scored a first-half goal to put them on course for a vital three points.But after being felled by an accidental headbutt from William Saliba, stand-in Seagulls captain Joao Pedro fired home from the spot in the 61st minute.The 1-1 draw means the second-placed Gunners are five points behind Liverpool, having played two games more, with Arne Slot's in-form leaders hosting crisis-hit Manchester United on Sunday.Arteta said his team had under-performed in the second half, failing to build momentum, adding that the penalty award was ""bizarre"".""We are really disappointed with the decision that leads to the goal because I have never seen something like this in my life,"" the Spaniard told the BBC.""He (Saliba) touches the ball as well.""Manchester City's win at home against West Ham means they have now won successive matches for the first time since October and Pep Guardiola will hope they are back on track after a horror run of one victory in 13 games in all competitions.The defending champions took an early lead through a Vladimir Coufal own goal and two goals from Erling Haaland put City in total command.Phil Foden made it 4-0 before Niclas Fullkrug grabbed a consolation for Julen Lopetegui's men, who suffered a 5-0 mauling by Liverpool last week.Despite their shocking run, sixth-placed City are just two points behind Chelsea, in fourth, but Guardiola said his team were still not back in the groove.""I'm very pleased for the result but you cannot ask me if the old City is back,"" he said. ""If you saw the game, we are not.""You saw many times during the years what we have done with the opponents.""In the early kick-off, Newcastle came from behind to clinch a fifth straight Premier League win and heap more misery on injury-hit Spurs.The home side went ahead in the fourth minute through Dominic Solanke.Newcastle levelled two minutes later when Anthony Gordon arrowed an effort into the bottom corner, but Postecoglou stood in disbelief on the touchline looking at referee Andrew Madley after Joelinton intercepted Lucas Bergvall's pass with his hand in the build-up.VAR deemed Joelinton's arm to be in a natural position and the contact to be accidental.In-form Alexander Isak scored what turned out to be the winner towards the end of the first period.The 2-1 victory, watched by new England manager Thomas Tuchel, leaves Newcastle in fifth spot, which may yet prove enough to secure a place in the Champions League next season.But Spurs have slumped to 12th in the table after five defeats in seven matches.Postecoglou said he was proud of his players but was the ""angriest I think I have ever been in my career"".""I think it's clear,"" said the Australian. ""Now whether people agree with me or not whether it wasn't handball or it was accidental, I'm just not interested in any of that discussion.""I know what everyone wants me to say, but all I'll say is that on any other day, on a fair and even playing ground, we would have won that game. Simple as that.""Enzo Maresca's Chelsea were breathing down Liverpool's necks just two weeks ago but have taken just two points from four games over the festive period.The prolific Cole Palmer gave the visitors a first-half lead, but they could not capitalise on their possession and Jean-Philippe Mateta levelled in the 82nd minute.Aston Villa beat relegation-threatened Leicester 2-1 at home, with goals from Ross Barkley and Leon Bailey.Brentford recorded their first league win on the road this season, smashing hapless Southampton 5-0, and Bournemouth beat Everton 1-0.",Arsenal blow chance to make up significant ground on Premier League leaders Liverpool.

Haryana shuttlers make a statement,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/badminton/haryana-shuttlers-make-a-statement/articleshow/116668736.cms,"BENGALURU: Haryana has always been India's mine for medals in sport. While they have excelled in sport like hockey, wrestling and boxing, women shuttlers from the state are now making a mark.A case to point is the recently concluded Senior Nationals badminton championships. Haryana won their maiden team title while Devika Sihag clinched the women's crown. Devika's triumph on Tuesday meant a hat-trick of singles titles for Haryana. Anmol Kharb and Anupama Upadhyay, representing Haryana, clinched the last two national titles, showcasing dominance in the women's competition. Besides, the talented 17-year-old Unnati Hooda is also from the state. Anmol made news earlier in the year, helping India win gold in the Badminton Asia Team Championships in Malaysia.""There are ranking tournaments in North now. Earlier, most of them were in Bengaluru and Hyderabad. We even have plenty of players in the U-11 category. The results we have been getting in the last three years has helped in the growth. Also, parents have realised that there is a future in badminton,"" said Harender Singh Malik, a coach at the Malik Badminton Academy in Sonipat, who added that five players from Haryana's winning team were from the academy.The emergence of several private academies has helped in popularising the sport. ""Earlier, there were just government centres with a huge number of kids. But private centres are smaller and more focused,"" said Malik.With the Haryana youngsters impressing at various levels, their progress will be closely monitored. The likes of Anmol, 17, and Unnati amongst others will be in focus as India look to carry on the legacy of Saina Nehwal and PV Sindhu ""If these girls can continue with the kind of passion they have now, they can be the next Sindhu and Saina (Nehwal). They have a chance, but they need to work hard and be more dedicated,"" said Haryana coach Ravikant Singla.It is common for young talent to fizzle out after age-group competitions. Some might fail to take their game to the next level, while others go after jobs for financial security. ""These kids are transitioning from juniors to seniors. A lot depends on how they adapt to injuries, superior quality (competitions and players). The next two years are important,"" said Malik.",Haryana has always been India's mine for medals in sport.

KSCA continues to push for RCB matches at Chinnaswamy



Poll Do you think RCB should prioritize securing a new home venue in Raipur over Indore? Yes, Raipur is a better choice No, Indore is more suitable Both options are equally valid

As Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) continue their hunt for an alternative home venue for the 2026 Indian Premier League (IPL) edition, the DY Patil Stadium in Navi Mumbai is off the table. It is reliably learnt that RCB have been asked by the Mumbai Indians to ""exhaust other options"" before considering the Navi Mumbai venue. Sources tracking developments explain it's in the same catchment area as MI and could set a wrong precedent going forward.“If a franchise wants to establish a home base not far from the home of another franchise, it needs clearance to go ahead. It is the same catchment area. Wankhede and DY Patil are not far apart. If a franchise wants to set up a base at DY Patil, it cannot happen without approval from the one operating out of Wankhede. MI reasoned, ‘Why only DY Patil and not any other stadium in the country? There are plenty. MI is of the opninion that RCB must exhaust other options before coming to DY Patil. There are so many non-IPL centres in the country,"" explained the source.""There are established centres like Rajkot, Pune, Raipur, Vizag and Indore. The current situation is simple, if MI says yes to DY Patil then tomorrow some other team can come and express desire to host their matches at Brabourne.It kills the sanctity of home territories. And there needs to be a strong reasoning in place why RCB is not ready to play at these centres and only interested in DY Patil,"" added the source.It is further understood that RCB have already had detailed conversations with the Chhattisgarh government about hosting at least two of their home matches in Raipur in the 2026 edition. With DY Patil no longer in the race, Indore has emerged as an option for the remaining five games.“There were discussions when DY Patil was in the race too, but now that it is no longer there, Indore is back in the mix,” added the source.Since the tragic June 4 stampede, the Chinnaswamy Stadium has not hosted a major cricket match. The iconic venue is currently undergoing upgrades based on the Justice D’Cunha committee’s 17 recommendations, and KSCA has already initiated work on most of them. RCB also met Karnataka Home Minister G Parameshwara on Monday. The meeting was attended by COO Rajesh Menon, KSCA president Venkatesh Prasad, and a few other representatives.Prasad was optimistic after Monday’s meeting, but the franchise continues to explore options. With the season approaching, the decision needs to be communicated to the IPL Governing Council and the BCCI at the earliest to ensure the timely release of the season’s fixtures.There is a venue inspection on Wednesday, and some clarity is expected after the meeting of officials.“At the Wednesday meeting, senior government, police and law officials will discuss what can be done at the government level and the instructions to be given to the KSCA. The extent of redressal of issues flagged by the Justice D’Cunha committee will have to be considered. We need the CM’s approval,” Parameshwara said.",Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) continue their hunt for an alternative home venue for the 2026 Indian Premier League (IPL) edition.

How PCB, ICC, BCB reached a resolution on India vs Pakistan T20 World Cup match

Poll How do you think Pakistan will perform against India in their upcoming match? They will win convincingly It will be a close match India will dominate

NEW DELHI: Pakistan opener Sahibzada Farhan has set the tone for a blockbuster showdown against India, promising a fearless and attacking approach when the two arch-rivals meet in Colombo on February 15. After Pakistan called off their boycott of the high-profile fixture late Monday night, the focus has swiftly shifted to preparations for what is expected to be one of the biggest matches of the tournament.Fresh from a fiery player-of-the-match performance against the USA, Farhan made his intentions clear at the post-match presentation. “We’ll go in with the same mindset as we did in our previous matches against India, including the Asia Cup. We’ll try to stay positive and play attacking cricket,” he said, underlining Pakistan’s aggressive outlook heading into the contest.Farhan’s confident words came after his blistering 73 laid the foundation for Pakistan’s 32-run win over the USA. The opener revealed he felt in rhythm even before the match began. “The way we practiced yesterday, the ball was coming onto my bat really well in the nets. I had already told our batting coach Hanif Malik that I was getting a good feeling,” he said.Farhan added that he had set himself a personal goal of winning at least two to three player-of-the-match awards during the World Cup.Pakistan captain Salman Ali Agha praised the team’s balanced approach, stating that while they enjoy chasing, they are equally comfortable setting a strong total. “We are comfortable chasing, but we try to bat first and put up above par, then defend. We have a flexible order,” he said.After a narrow escape against the Netherlands in their opener, Pakistan’s clinical display against the USA boosted confidence. However, Agha admitted there is still room for improvement, especially in the powerplay bowling, as Pakistan aim to sharpen their edge ahead of the marquee India clash.",Sahibzada Farhan says Pakistan will play attacking cricket against India.

T20 World Cup Groups Explained: Who Can Reach the Super 8

NEW DELHI: Namibia’s training session on the eve of their T20 World Cup opener against the Netherlands here followed a familiar script of cones laid out, throwdowns hurled and drives clipped into the outfield. Yet, standing slightly apart from the bustle, arms folded and eyes following every movement, was a figure whose presence carried quiet authority. Gary Kirsten doesn’t wear the Namibian colours but his imprint on this squad is already unmistakable.Kirsten, the former India head coach and South Africa opener, has joined Namibia as a consultant for the T20 World Cup. It is a role that suits him: low on noise, high on influence. For a team still navigating the thin line between associate ambition and elite-level consistency, Kirsten’s arrival offers reassurance and edge.Namibia captain Gerhard Erasmus is clear about what Kirsten brings. There is, first, the obvious pedigree. Kirsten has toured the subcontinent extensively as a player, coached in the IPL and most memorably guided the India team under MS Dhoni to the 2011 ODI World Cup triumph.“He (Kirsten) has lots of experience. He brings a winning edge to our campaign.He also brings lots of knowledge of the different grounds in India,” Erasmus said.Besides trophies, what seems to resonate far more with this Namibian group is how Kirsten goes about his work. Erasmus hinted that the influence is subtle but deeply felt. “It’s very nice in terms of management that you have such pedigreed mentor-cumcoaches who really like to bring the human side to their coaching first and they really like to connect with the players at a deeper level,” Erasmus said.For a side like Namibia, where players often balance cricketing dreams with semi-professional realities, a player-first approach carries even greater weight.“That’s what (having a playerfirst approach) we respect most about Gary and all the other coaches. Cricket is very much conditions based and it’s awesome to have him,” the 30-year-old Namibian captain said.",Gary Kirsten has joined Namibia as a consultant for the T20 World Cup.

Several familiar names have been left out as the BCCI announced its central contracts for the 2025–26 season on Monday, with Mohammed Shami , Rajat Patidar, Sarfaraz Khan, Mukesh Kumar and Ishan Kishan missing out despite being part of the previous cycle.The Board awarded annual retainers to 30 men and 21 women cricketers, categorising them into Groups A, B and C. Notably, the A+ category has been scrapped, a move that has reshaped the contract hierarchy.Senior stalwarts Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma have been placed in Group B, a downgrade that was largely expected following their retirement from Tests and T20Is respectively, effectively making them one-format players. Under the current criteria, which factors in performances and the number of matches played in the preceding season, they were no longer eligible for the top bracket.For the first time in his career, Shubman Gill finds himself in the highest pay grade, as the two-format captain was retained in Group A alongside Jasprit Bumrah and Ravindra Jadeja . While the BCCI has not officially disclosed the retainership amounts, Group A was previously valued at Rs 5 crore annually, with Group B and C fetching Rs 3 crore and Rs 1 crore respectively before the A+ category was abolished.The decision to do away with A+ stems from the fact that Bumrah is now the only player who remains an automatic selection across all formats.The category, introduced during the COA era for all-format excellence, previously featured only Kohli, Rohit, Jadeja and Bumrah.The men’s list has been trimmed from 34 to 30 players, with Shami’s exclusion seen as a strong signal that he may be out of the selectors’ immediate plans. Kishan, Mukesh and Sarfaraz were also dropped after failing to play a single international match during the evaluation period. While Kishan has returned to the T20I setup, that comeback falls in the new cycle.One notable inclusion is Sai Sudharsan, the only new entrant in the senior men’s contract list.On the women’s side, Harmanpreet Kaur, Smriti Mandhana and Deepti Sharma retained their Group A status, while Jemimah Rodrigues earned a promotion following her standout World Cup performances.","Mohammed Shami, Rajat Patidar, Sarfaraz Khan, Mukesh Kumar and Ishan Kishan missing out despite being part of the previous cycle.

NEW DELHI: Having been pushed to the brink by lower-ranked Nepal in their tournament opener, England will be keen to deliver a more convincing display when they face the West Indies in a high-stakes Group C clash of the T20 World Cup on Wednesday. With both sides having lifted the trophy twice, the contest carries added significance as they chase a third title, alongside co-hosts and defending champions India.England were given a timely reminder of how unforgiving the shortest format can be. Despite facing a side several places below them on paper, the Harry Brook-led outfit found themselves in a dogfight, eventually scraping through with a narrow four-run victory. The tense finish underlined how fine the margins are in T20 cricket and served as a warning that reputation alone offers no guarantees.That close call is likely to keep England sharp as the tournament progresses. While they walked away with two points, their performance left room for improvement, particularly in tightening key phases of the game against quality opposition.The need for a stronger showing is also reflected in the Group C standings.England currently sit third despite their win, with a net run rate of 0.200. Scotland occupy second place on the table, also on two points but with a healthier NRR of 0.950.The West Indies, meanwhile, have made a stronger early statement. They too have two points from their opening fixture but top the group on net run rate, boasting an impressive 1.750. That sets up Wednesday’s clash as a crucial encounter, not just in terms of points but also momentum and table position.The England vs West Indies T20 World Cup match will be played on Wednesday, February 11.The match will start at 7:00 pm IST, with the toss scheduled for 6:30 pm IST.The England vs West Indies T20 World Cup match will be held at the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai.The match will be broadcast live on the Star Sports Network.Live updates and coverage will be available on TimesofIndia.com.Brandon King, Shai Hope(w/c), Shimron Hetmyer, Rovman Powell, Sherfane Rutherford, Jason Holder, Romario Shepherd, Akeal Hosein, Matthew Forde, Gudakesh Motie, Shamar Joseph: Philip Salt, Jos Buttler(w), Jacob Bethell, Tom Banton, Harry Brook(c), Sam Curran, Will Jacks, Liam Dawson, Jofra Archer, Adil Rashid, Luke Wood: Harry Brook (c), Jos Buttler (wk), Tom Bandon (wk), Phil Salt (wk), Ben Duckett, Jacob Bethell, Sam Curran, Liam Dawson, Will Jacks, Jamie Overton, Rehan Ahmed, Jofra Archer, Adil Rashid, Josh Tongue.Shai Hope (c&wk), Johnson Charles (wk), Shimron Hetmyer, Brandon King, Rovman Powell, Sherfane Rutherford, Quentin Sampson, Roston Chase, Jason Holder, Romario Shepherd, Matthew Forde, Akeal Hosein, Shamar Joseph, Gudakesh Motie, Jayden Seales.","England take on the West Indies in the T20 World Cup on Wednesday.

Dear Gautam Gambhir and Suryakumar Yadav, don't let Ishan Kishan down

Australia received a major jolt ahead of their T20 World Cup opener — against Ireland in Colombo — when premier fast bowler Josh Hazlewood ruled himself out due to an Achilles injury. The 35-yearold’s injury punched a neat little hole into Australia’s T20 World Cup plans, forcing captain Mitchell Marsh to redraw his bowling maps.While another Aussie pace ace, Mitchell Starc, has retired from the format, Test captain and fast bowler Pat Cummins too is out injured. This will be the first major ICC tournament since 2016 where Australia will not feature a single member of their famed pace trio.Hazlewood’s value in the subcontinent has never been about raw pace or intimidation. It’s about geometry, the hard, Test-match length that cramps batters on slow surfaces. The back-of-a-length deliveries that refuse to sit up. The metronomic control that allows captains to hide a spinner and hold match-ups.In Asian conditions, Hazlewood is that rare seamer who doesn’t need swing to dominate.Spotlight on ZampaWithout Hazlewood, Australia’s bowling becomes more volatile and less potent. His absence even puts pressure on Australia’s spin stocks to deliver.Leg-spinner Adam Zampa remains the lynchpin, arguably Australia’s most important bowler in T20Is in the subcontinent. His success, though, relies on control at the other end. If seamers are expensive, Marsh may be forced to deploy Zampa defensively, nullifying his threat.The supporting cast includes spinners Xavier Bartlett, Cooper Connolly and pacer Ben Dwarshuis. Marsh is confident that his relatively inexperienced bowling attack will rise to the challenge.On the eve of their opening game against Ireland, Marsh admitted that the team needs to adapt quickly, especially with Sri Lankan conditions expected to favour slower bowlers.Australia will adjust, as they always do, with tactical flexibility. That means batting deep, relying on matchups and extra overs from Glenn Maxwell. But losing their most potent pace weapons is an added complication.",Josh Hazlewood ruled himself out of the T20 World Cup with an Achilles injury. Mitchell Starc has retired from the format.

India batters destruct | End of Ishan Kishan vs Sanju Samson

Pakistan remain a bit of a mystery. Their batting is blow-hot, blow-cold, the pace bowling just about average but the 2022 finalists have a new trick up their sleeve — the spin choke. Come Sunday, that’s something India have to be careful of, especially on the Premadasa track that gets slower under lights.On Tuesday, 190-9 wasn’t the steepest chase at the Sinhalese Sports Complex ground. But it was the Pakistan spin quartet of leftarmer Mohammed Nawaz, leggies Shadab Khan and Abrar Ahmed and mystery ‘slinger’ Usman Tariq who completely took the steam out of the chase. Nawaz and Shadab, between the seventh to ninth overs, gave only 10 runs for one wicket and USA’s early momentum of 52-1 from the Powerplay was gone. Tariq then came along with his box of tricks on a slow pitch and it was impossible for the USA batters — inexperienced at this level — to deal with the lack of pace and the occasional turn.While Tariq capped it off with 3-27, the quartet gave away only 104 off 15, which was significantly lower than the asking-rate. The 32-run win should give Pakistan confidence going into the Sunday blockbuster.The form of opener Sahibzada Farhan and senior pro Babar Azam was also a relief for the 2009 champions.Opener Farhan (73 off 41 balls) has shown on and off that he has the power to be a threat. Against an USA attack that was missing Ali Khan — the best paceman among the Associate nations — due to an injury, Farhan got some runs that will allow him to go into the India game with some confidence.Clearing his left foot, Farhan showed his ability to hit through the line and clear the fence with ease. With left-hander Saim Ayub (19 off 17 balls), Farhan put up 54-1 in 5.1 overs, just about par. But it was Farhan’s partnership with Babar (46 off 32 balls) that gave Pakistan the cushion to feel comfortable. Babar, after his failure in the first match, didn’t try to re-invent the wheel. He knows that a slam-bang style won’t suit him and gave himself just that little bit of time to get his eye in, then took his chances against left-arm spinner Harmeet Singh.Brief scores: Pakistan 190/9 in 20 overs (Sahibzada Farhan 73, Babar Azam 46; van Schalkwyk 4/25) beat USA 158/8 in 20 overs (Shubham Ranjane 51, Shayan Jahangir 49, Usman Tariq 3/27) by 32 runs.",Pakistan beat USA by 32 runs to reach 2022 Cricket World Cup final.

India batters destruct | End of Ishan Kishan vs Sanju Samson

NEW DELHI: Carrying a family name in sport can be a burden. For Dutch allrounder Bas de Leede , it has been more of a subtle reminder.The De Leedes are woven into the fabric of Dutch cricket. His father Tim de Leede played in a very different time, when the Netherlands turning up at a World Cup was an event in itself. Bas has grown up with those stories in the background, not as expectations but as context.So, when he played a decisive hand in Netherlands’ win against Namibia in the T20 World Cup on Tuesday — an unbeaten 72, along with two wickets — it didn’t feel like a son trying to step out of his father’s shadow. It felt like a continuation.Bas has never been pushed to become a replica of Tim. Cricket entered his life naturally, almost accidentally. “I first started playing cricket in the living room with my dad, just about the same time as I started to walk,” Bas said.The game stayed with him, evolving as he did. Tim, aware of how much cricket has changed since his own playing days, has kept a respectful distance. “He’s (Tim) always been kind of letting me go free and try and play my own game and not be too involved,” Bas said.Tim de Leede remains one of the most influential cricketers the Netherlands has produced.A hard-hitting middle order batter, a reliable bowler, and a leader who helped give Dutch cricket its earliest sense of belonging on the world stage.Tim played 29 ODIs for the Netherlands, captained the national side, and tested himself in English County cricket with Northamptonshire, Sussex and Surrey. His most famous moment came during the 2003 ODI World Cup in Paarl when he got the prized scalp of Sachin Tendulkar during a spell of 4 for 35. His figures also included the wicket of Rahul Dravid. Inzamam-ul-Haq and Matthew Hayden were also among his World Cup scalps.The 2007 World Cup in the Caribbean was Tim’s swansong. By then, the game had already begun to change. Perhaps that is why, when Bas began charting his own path, his father chose restraint over instruction. “I chat with him about his memories from the World Cups, which is a nice thing, but other than that not much,” Bas said. Advice is limited, and deliberately so. “In terms of tips, he didn’t give too much... to be honest. He played in the era where T20 cricket wasn’t a massive thing yet.”There have been moments when the past has briefly leaned into the present. “I think three years ago, when the 50-over World Cup was held in India, I spoke to him a little bit about India and Indian conditions,” Bas said after his match-winning performance at the Arun Jaitley Stadium on Tuesday.But even then, he is clear about the boundaries. “Times have changed.

AHMEDABAD: The defeat to New Zealand in their opening game has left Afghanistan in a precarious situation. The Rashid Khan-led side will require nothing less than a victory against South Africa at the Narendra Modi Stadium here on Wednesday to keep themselves in contention for a Super 8 berth from Group D.With South Africa recording a commanding win over Canada in their opening game at the same venue, the pressure is firmly on Afghanistan. Rashid Khan was clearly not happy with the performance of his bowlers against New Zealand and urged them to step up for Wednesday’s game. “The line and length allowed them (New Zealand) to play shots freely. On a wicket with not much help for either the seamers or the spinners, we needed to keep it tight. We didn’t do it, we didn’t hit the right areas consistently and that’s why we gave away so many runs,” said Rashid.The Afghanistan team management will also be contemplating including left-arm wrist spinner Noor Ahmad in the playing XI after dropping him for the first game, given that Canadian left-arm wrist spinner Ansh Patel claimed three wickets against the South Africans.Afghanistan might also be tempted to look at their batting template of keeping it steady in the Powerplay and accelerating towards the death overs.South Africa, meanwhile, got most things right against Canada, barring the middle overs where they lost three wickets quickly, a fact alluded to by southpaw David Miller.“There was a little lull in the middle overs. If you lose a couple of wickets, you take one or two overs to regroup. So it was really nice to bat with (Tristan Stubbs) at the back end. We were in there for a couple of overs and I personally found it a bit tough to strike the ball. I felt just a bit out of rhythm,” admitted Miller, the man in form.",Afghanistan face South Africa in their second Group D match on Wednesday.

MUMBAI: Ten years ago at the Wankhede, England learned how unforgiving a flat deck can be. On March 16, 2016, Chris Gayle tore into them with a 48-ball 100 not out (11 sixes, five fours) as West Indies raced to 183/4 in 18.1 overs to overhaul England’s 182/6. On Wednesday, two-time champions England face fellow two-time winners West Indies at the Wankhede again in a key Group C clash, with England eager to tighten up after being taken deep by Nepal in their opener. England posted 184/7 but survived by four runs.“Chris Gayle was the best T20 batter there’s ever been. Hopefully the result can be different (on Wednesday),” said Jos Buttler , who played in the 2016 game. West Indies coach Daren Sammy, who led them to the 2016 title, expects another run-fest. “We walked out and Chris Gayle said that they (England) are 30 runs short. So that’s the Wankhede for you. It’s a tough place to defend,” he said.Sammy’s side arrive with momentum after beating Scotland by 35 runs in Kolkata. Shimron Hetmyer blasted 64 off 36 balls, striking six sixes, before Romario Shepherd ripped through Scotland with 5/20, including a hat-trick. West Indies will also lean on captain Shai Hope.England, for their part, know they will need better control at the death and sharper fields if they are to avoid another close call. With two former champions on a ground built for boundaries, Wednesday’s contest could be a high-scoring thriller.","Two-time champions England face fellow two-time winners West Indies at the Wankhede.

MUMBAI: In Formula One, race engineers direct drivers in real time over radio. In football, managers bark instructions from the touchline. In cricket, players have traditionally been left to figure it out themselves out in the middle, but that may be changing.During England’s T20 World Cup opener against Nepal at the Wankhede Stadium on Sunday, head coach Brendon McCullum was seen communicating with captain Harry Brook on a walkie-talkie during a drinks break. McCullum also stayed in touch with Brook during England’s recent white-ball tour of Sri Lanka.Former England captain Jos Buttler believes cricket remains behind other sports when it comes to relaying messages to players on the field. “I think so, there’s (been) walkietalkies for a while to be fair. But then the communication from top to bottom has always been really good in the group,” Buttler told reporters.Buttler said coaches in other sports have long used real-time communication and noted that he had seen the approach in the IPL too. “In cricket, coaches are getting more involved real-time. I’ve played in the IPL, at Gujarat (Titans), Ashish Nehra is very active on the boundary ropes. But it seems like cricket is the kind of sport where we are still a bit behind, maybe in that area where you look at other sports, the managers and coaches, and you think of rugby, where they are always running messages.So, maybe that will come more and more into cricket,” he said.Calling McCullum “as sharp a coach as I’ve ever worked with”, Buttler said the walkie-talkie is another example of his edge. “Baz can sit with his feet up and his sunglasses on and look very relaxed but he’s as sharp a coach as I’ve ever worked with. He doesn’t miss a beat,” Buttler said, adding: “The walkietalkie’s there so he can just send a few messages down to the guys on the bench and if there’s anything to relay on to the pitch. It’s a more obvious line of communication.”",Jos Buttler believes cricket remains behind other sports when it comes to relaying messages to players on the field.

It’s white and cold! Cole Palmer covered his ears with his black-gloved hands after his customary ‘brrr’ celebration. Stepping up in Chelsea’s allwhite gear, he had planted the opening penalty against Wolves in the right corner last Saturday before breaking into the familiar pose, and an unfamiliar one.Outside noise? It has been a season interrupted with injuries, and it’s easy for doubts to creep in. There are rumours of ‘homesickness’; for the Manchester boy, who had sharpened his skills at City, and now linked to childhood love United, there was that unsettled feeling too.“Just people talking rubbish,” Palmer told The Times Of India in an interaction facilitated by JioStar. “Honestly it doesn’t bother me.”Letting his boots do the talking, he became the first player in Premier League history to register three 1st-half trebles.His immediate Insta post after delivering the message at Molineux, was captioned “Just enjoy.” Perhaps, it was a note to himself, as he makes sense of a stop-start injury-hit campaign. His words are defiant, though. “No, it doesn’t shake me. Of course I want to perform well, but if things get tough, it doesn’t really affect my confidence too much.”Cole processes praise and criticism in much the same way: “The same people who talk bad about you one minute will call you the best thing after you score. It doesn’t bother me.”That emotional equilibrium has been there for a while. Still only 23, he seems like an old soul amidst the uncertainty of constant shuffle at the heart of Stamford Bridge. He traces that calmness back home. “I think it comes from my dad,” he said. “From a young age, he taught me not to get too high or too low, no matter what.”Despite stepping up to the big league from the City production line, he got his one-way ticket to West London in the autumn of 2023. “I always knew I had the ability. I just needed a platform to show it,” the boy from Wythenshawe chose Chelsea to further his pro-levels of football education.The no-fuss No. 10 has so far collected 51 goals at his present club. There are World Cup ambitions too. But for now, the England international with a grandfather from St Kitts, is dealing with the vagaries of a sporting career.As Liam Rosenior’s Chelsea, in fifth place, host Leeds United in the EPL tonight, Cole finds himself in the starting XI in less than half the games this season, scoring 8 goals in 17 games. “This is something new to me,” Palmer shared with his club website. “I’ve never been injured before. I’ve not played a game this season fully fit. I’ve been overthinking it too.”It’s about managing fitness and expectations. Scoring hat-tricks will certainly amp up the noise, though. Cole Palmer is “just a normal guy like everyone else,” he tells you. But then, he can’t lead a normal life.(CATCH ALL THE ACTION FROM THE PREMIER LEAGUE, LIVE & EXCLUSIVE ON STAR SPORTS NETWORK AND JIOHOTSTAR)",Cole Palmer is the first player in Premier League history to register three 1st- half trebles.

NEW DELHI: Mexican authorities have announced that robot dogs will be deployed to assist police operations during the 2026 FIFA World Cup, as part of enhanced security measures for the tournament.The four-legged robotic units are built to venture into high-risk zones and relay live video footage to law enforcement teams, allowing officers to assess situations remotely before moving in during World Cup-related operations.The month-long global event, scheduled to run from June 11 to July 19, will be jointly hosted by Mexico, the United States and Canada.The robot dogs were purchased by the Guadalupe city council — located in the Monterrey metropolitan region, one of the World Cup host areas — at a cost of 2.5 million pesos (approximately $145,000). Monterrey is set to stage matches at BBVA Stadium, which will be temporarily renamed Estadio Monterrey for the tournament.Footage released by local authorities shows one of the robots navigating an abandoned structure, walking up staircases with measured precision while transmitting real-time visuals back to police officers following at a distance.During the demonstration, the robotic canine confronts an armed individual and uses a built-in loudspeaker to instruct him to drop his weapon, showcasing its role in frontline assessment and de-escalation.Guadalupe mayor Hector Garcia said the robots are intended to assist officers during initial interventions, reducing direct exposure to potential threats. “The objective is to protect the physical integrity of our police,” he said, adding that the machines will be deployed whenever disturbances or confrontations arise.Estadio Monterrey is scheduled to host four World Cup matches during the tournament.","Mexican authorities have announced that robot dogs will be deployed to assist police during the 2026 FIFA World Cup.

- Guehi booed -

LIVERPOOL: Erling Haaland's stoppage-time penalty earned Manchester City a dramatic 2-1 win at Liverpool on Sunday to reduce Arsenal's lead at the top of the Premier League back to six points. City were heading for defeat at Anfield with six minutes to go before Bernardo Silva cancelled out Dominik Szoboszlai's stunning free-kick to spark an incredible finale.Haaland put City in front from the spot before the visitors had another goal ruled out and Szoboszlai was sent off in the same incident after a VAR review.Victory was City's first away to Liverpool in front of a crowd since 2003 and reapplies some pressure to Arsenal's quest for a first title in 22 years.""I feel the whole team knew before the game, if we lost it then the title race was probably over,"" said Silva. ""We felt like we needed to win.""Defeat delivered another blow to Liverpool's hopes of Champions League football next season.The defending champions remain down in sixth and four points adrift of the top five.These two clubs have combined to win the last eight Premier League titles, but both showed the flaws which have opened the door for Arsenal to potentially end their long wait to be crowned champions of England once again.Haaland has scored just once from open play in his last 13 games and an uncharacteristic lack of confidence from the Norwegian showed with the best chance of the first half inside the opening two minutes.Silva's clever pass split the Liverpool defence, but Haaland's shot lacked conviction under pressure from Milos Kerkez, and Alisson Becker was able to save low to his left.Second half slumps have been a consistent feature of City's season and the visitors again faded in the second period until a late flurry saved their title challenge.""Second half we pressed really high and played good football,"" said Liverpool boss Arne Slot. ""We have improved so much, but we need to improve the results.""Marc Guehi was relentlessly booed after his proposed move to Liverpool from Crystal Palace broke down on transfer deadline day in September.City took advantage to swoop in last month when they lost two key centre-backs to injury.Guehi was fortunate to escape with just a yellow card when he dragged down Mo Salah just outside the box in a decision that infuriated Slot.But it was City who were left fuming at the award of the free-kick which led to the opener when Ryan Gravenberch went down under minimal contact.Szoboszlai scored the only goal with an outrageous free-kick when Arsenal visited Anfield in August and produced another stunning strike which clipped the inside of the post before finding the net.However, the Hungarian went from hero to villain when City levelled six minutes from time.Szoboszlai played Silva onside as he slid in to volley home Haaland's header for City's first second-half goal in the Premier League this year.Alisson then wiped out Matheus Nunes to concede a penalty and Haaland kept his cool from the spot to put City in front.Pep Guardiola's men then needed a stunning save from Gianluigi Donnarumma to tip behind Alexis Mac Allister's deflected shot.With Alisson remaining forward from the resulting corner, the Liverpool goal was open when Rayan Cherki took aim from the halfway line to roll the ball into an empty net.However, Haaland and Szoboszlai's grappling as the ball trickled towards the goal saw the strike ruled out, with a free-kick awarded to City instead, and the Liverpool player given his marching orders.",Erling Haaland's stoppage-time penalty earned Manchester City a dramatic 2-1 win at Liverpool on Sunday.

Barcelona strengthened their grip on the La Liga title race with a commanding 3-0 victory over Mallorca on Saturday, opening up a four-point lead at the top of the table. Teenage sensation Lamine Yamal played a central role, responding to an earlier miss with a stunning long-range finish that underlined his growing influence. Robert Lewandowski set Barça on their way in the first half before 18-year-old academy graduate Marc Bernal wrapped up the points late on with the first goal of his senior career. The result gives Barcelona breathing space at the summit, although second-placed Real Madrid have the chance to cut the deficit to a single point when they travel to Valencia on Sunday.Lewandowski broke the deadlock in the 29th minute, reacting quickest after Marcus Rashford’s initial effort down the left was blocked. The striker calmly brought the ball under control, shifted it away from a defender and finished with precision from close range.Rashford’s growing confidence was evident again just before the interval. His curling free kick in stoppage time forced an excellent save from Mallorca goalkeeper Leo Roman. The rebound dropped invitingly for Jules Koundé inside the area, but his mishit effort fell to Yamal, who surprisingly failed to convert from virtually on the goal line.Lewandowski, one of the game’s most prolific scorers with more than 650 club goals to his name, was quick to encourage the young winger after the miss. Yamal made amends in emphatic fashion in the 61st minute. Skipping past a defender on the edge of the box, he unleashed a fierce, dipping left-footed strike into the bottom corner, leaving Roman rooted to the spot.Both Yamal and Lewandowski were substituted later in the match and watched on approvingly as Bernal added the third in the 83rd minute. Barcelona cut through Mallorca’s midfield with a sharp passing move that released the teenager, who showed impressive composure to glide past a defender and slot the ball neatly inside the post.Elsewhere in La Liga, two fixtures were postponed. Rayo Vallecano’s home clash with Oviedo was called off due to safety concerns over the pitch at Vallecas Stadium, while Sevilla’s match against Girona was also postponed because of adverse weather. Oviedo said it understood the decision but criticised the late notice and confirmed it was considering legal action.",Barcelona beat Mallorca 3-0 to move four points clear at the top of La Liga.

T.J. Watt Trade Rumor: Is the star linebacker heading to the Buffalo Bills?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/t-j-watt-trade-rumor-is-the-star-linebacker-heading-to-the-buffalo-bills/articleshow/128186435.cms,"Image via Getty

Could the superstar linebacker land with Buffalo?

The Pittsburgh Steelers face a crucial decision this offseason. T.J. Watt, the Steelers star linebacker, is under contract for three more years, with a cap hit of about $42 million per season. But recent rumors allude to a potential trade ahead.At 32, the question is whether Watt still delivers enough on the field or if the Steelers should trade him for draft picks and cap flexibility. Recent reports suggest that a trade could be on the table, and one team has emerged as a serious candidate: the Buffalo Bills.Steelers insider Ray Fittipaldo told reporters that Watt’s trade value is limited to a second-round pick. Another Steelers insider, Nick Farabaugh, said in the same discussion that “the Steelers should trade T.J. Watt,” highlighting the growing speculation around the linebacker’s future. Steelers beat writer Jarrett Bailey listed Watt’s top landing spots as the Cowboys, Commanders, Packers, 49ers, and Bills. Of these, Buffalo seems the most plausible.The Bills, led by new head coach Joe Brady, need a dominant pass rusher.Bailey explained in a February 2026 report that “the Bills took a swing at an aging edge rusher back in 2022 when they signed Von Miller. It looked as if that was going to be a tremendous signing for about half a season before Miller tore his ACL on Thanksgiving that year. After another disappointing playoff loss that led to a head coaching change, general manager Brandon Beane needs to be aggressive to add as much proven talent to the roster as possible. Putting Watt alongside Greg Rousseau with Michael Hoecht rotating in would give Buffalo a very nice trio.”Buffalo’s current roster already has talent on the defensive line, with Deone Walker and Ed Oliver anchoring the interior. Greg Rousseau excels as a run defender, but the team lacks an elite pass rusher. Adding Watt would immediately address this gap and make the Bills’ front seven more competitive against the league’s top offenses.The biggest hurdle is the cap. Buffalo is roughly $9 million under the cap, making Watt’s $42 million salary challenging. Any trade would require careful financial planning, but the potential defensive boost could outweigh the cost.For Pittsburgh, moving Watt would signal a shift under Mike McCarthy. The team could gain cap relief and draft assets, but letting go of a proven pass rusher is never easy. For Buffalo, Watt represents a chance to secure an immediate defensive star and reshape their pass-rush strategy.As the NFL offseason unfolds, all eyes will remain on TJ Watt. Will the Steelers cash in on a superstar, or will Buffalo land the veteran pass rusher they desperately need?","T.J.

Trevor Lawrence did not leave this year’s NFL Honors ceremony with an individual award, but the night still carried significance for the Jacksonville Jaguars quarterback. After a season that once again placed him under the league’s microscope, Lawrence found support in a moment that shifted attention away from trophies and toward personal belief.The ceremony celebrated the NFL’s standout performances, with Matthew Stafford named MVP and Christian McCaffrey earning Comeback Player of the Year honors. While those announcements dominated the stage, Lawrence’s moment came shortly after, when his wife Marissa Lawrence shared a heartfelt message that offered a different lens on success and recognition.Lawrence’s season unfolded under heavy expectations. Before the 2024 campaign, he signed a five year, $275 million contract extension that cemented his role as the long term face of the Jacksonville Jaguars. With that deal came added pressure, constant evaluation, and the responsibility of leading a franchise still shaping its future.On Monday, Marissa Lawrence took to Instagram to publicly support her husband, focusing less on awards and more on the values she believes define him as both a player and a person. “Trev I’ve said it one million times but you are the easiest person to be proud of,” Marissa wrote. “I’m so glad I got to be by your side and celebrate you regardless of awards or not!”Her message highlighted the work that rarely appears in box scores or award discussions.Marissa praised Lawrence’s dedication to the game, his leadership, and his ability to remain humble despite the constant spotlight that follows a franchise quarterback.“Your dedication to this game, your leadership, your ability to stay humble and driven, the adversities you have faced, the sacrifices you make it doesn’t go unnoticed or unseen,” she added. “I’ll always cheer you on! I love you.”The post resonated with fans who have followed Trevor Lawrence’s journey from early stardom to the realities of NFL leadership. As the Jaguars look ahead, he remains central to the franchise’s plans regardless of award outcomes. In a league defined by constant judgment, Marissa Lawrence’s message offered a reminder that belief, support, and steady leadership often matter long after the awards are handed out.",Trevor Lawrence did not leave the NFL Honors ceremony with an individual award.

NFL insider reveals why Miami is “unlikely to” part ways with Tua Tagovailoa due to this one factor,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/nfl-insider-reveals-why-miami-is-unlikely-to-part-ways-with-tua-tagovailoa-due-to-this-one-factor/articleshow/128184623.cms,"NFL Insider thinks Miami Dolphins is unlikely to trade Tua Tagovailoa' for a crucial reasonImage via: Getty

Miami Dolphins' trade options are blocked by the contract factor, as per an NFL insider



(Image via Getty: Tua Tagovailoa)

The Miami Dolphins face a major challenge with Tua Tagovailoa. Fans have speculated about a trade since he was benched after the Week 15 clash against the Pittsburgh Steelers. And the heat was further ignited when Ian Rapoport said that he would be ""surprised"" if Tua stays with the Dolphins. But the new take from NFL insider Dan Graziano on Tua's massive contract signals something different. It seems financial realities are keeping Miami tied to the quarterback for now.The Dolphins signed Tua to a four-year, $212 million extension in 2024 after he led the NFL in passing yards and made a name for himself with stunning numbers. Since then, performance and injuries have created uncertainty. With a huge contract looming, Miami wants to move on, but league sources indicate that finding a trade partner is nearly impossible without absorbing most of his salary.The biggest roadblock is Tua's guaranteed money. ESPN's Dan Graziano said, ""The Dolphins are unlikely to find a trade partner for Tua Tagovailoa and will most likely have to pay most of Tua's contract to find a suitor."" The quote highlights why no team is rushing to make a deal. Even teams that need a quarterback, such as the Vikings, must consider the cost and cap implications before taking him on.Experts suggest that Miami could use a post-June 1 cut to spread the dead-cap charges over two seasons, which would still leave $67 million in 2026 and $32 million in 2027.Per the NFL's Adam Schefter, ""Cutting Tagovailoa would leave a $99 million dead money salary cap charge - the largest in NFL history - while designating him as a post-June 1 cut would spread out the money over two years.""As of 2025, Tua has posted 20 TDs and 15 INTs, which is a major downfall for a quarterback of his calibre. The situation shows that Tua's future in Miami is not a matter of play but of money. The Dolphins must carefully navigate the largest contract of a quarterback in franchise history to avoid further financial strain. Until then, the Dolphins are unlikely to part ways with Tagovailoa, and the offseason will be closely watched by fans and analysts alike.","Tua Tagovailoa signed a four-year, $212 million extension in 2024 after he led the NFL in passing yards and made a name for himself.

NFL MVP award debate: Why quarterbacks dominate and what Myles Garrett argues



The NFL MVP award once again belongs to a quarterback, with Matthew Stafford earning this year’s honor and reinforcing a trend that has defined the modern era. The league’s most prestigious individual trophy rarely strays from the position that touches the ball on every snap. In fact, no non-quarterback has won the award since 2012, and only 15 players outside the position have claimed it since the 1966 merger. Just two pure defensive players have ever lifted the trophy.That imbalance has not gone unnoticed inside locker rooms. Two time Defensive Player of the Year Myles Garrett raised the issue during a candid conversation with Micah Parsons on Parsons’ podcast this week. The debate cut straight to the heart of the sport’s biggest individual prize. Who truly defines value in the NFL , and why does the answer almost always point to a quarterback?The numbers explain part of the story. Quarterbacks drive scoring, control tempo, and shape headlines every Sunday. Fans see touchdown passes, passing yards, and fourth quarter comebacks. Those moments stay fresh in voters’ minds.Garrett believes that visibility plays a decisive role.“I feel like QBs have MVP on lock because they have the ball in their hand pretty much every play,” Garrett said. “... It’s too easily handed to them.”His argument goes deeper than frustration. Garrett points to how defensive excellence often hides behind advanced data that casual viewers rarely track.“I feel like we’re not taking into account with the things that we do. A lot of the numbers that we have, you have to go to like advanced metrics to see how good you [Parsons] are at what you do or I am or what I do. So, to the casual guy who’s just looking at the scoreboard, he’s like ‘Well, you know Sam Darnold threw for four touchdowns. He’s got to be MVP.’ It’s like, Micah had 10 pressures. He also lost three rushes all day. That’s incredible, but that’s not as easily seen as touchdowns, yards, catches, rushes and all that. ”Garrett’s case carries weight. He broke the single season sack record with 23 in 2025 and secured his second Defensive Player of the Year award. Few defenders have combined production and impact the way he has. If a defensive player is going to challenge the status quo, Garrett has built the résumé to do it.","The NFL MVP award once again belongs to a quarterback, with Matthew Stafford earning this year’s honor.

Bad Bunny did not just perform at Super Bowl LX. He delivered a cultural moment that reached 128.2 million average viewers, according to Nielsen. That figure topped the game’s overall U.S. audience of 124.9 million. It did fall short of Kendrick Lamar’s 133.5 million record from last year, but the scale remains historic.

The Super Bowl night of Stefon Diggs concluded with a heartbreak on the field and it did not end there. The rumors of their break up went viral within hours after the Patriots lost to the Seattle Seahawks, as fans noticed that the two were no longer following each other on Instagram as well as the fact that the two had unfollowed one another. Then things escalated. An alleged internet conversation between the two started to go around, which did not help a moment which was already tense.This viral screenshot purported that Cardi B said that Diggs was ""a disgrace to football"" and Diggs responded, ""You are a disgrace to music"". The post was rapidly spread over the platforms and both NFL and hip hop fans reacted sharply to it.

Early rumors suggested an Italian venue, but new reports say the couple will marry at Swift’s Rhode Island estate. With tighter privacy plans in place, a surprise reunion now seems unlikely despite ongoing fan theories.

Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift’s upcoming wedding sparks unexpected Harry Styles chatter

Speculation around Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce has reached a new pitch, and not just because wedding plans are quietly taking shape. Last year's Roman getaway has drawn Harry Styles into the conversation, reigniting a chapter fans never fully closed. The timing alone has fueled theories, even as the couple’s inner circle keeps details sealed tight.The intrigue grew after Styles was spotted in Rome with Zoë Kravitz, prompting online sleuths to connect dots between Italy and early whispers about a European ceremony. Those whispers now appear outdated. Fresh reporting points to a more private plan on U.S. soil, shifting the narrative and cooling expectations of an accidental reunion across continents.Sources say Swift and Kelce are preparing a carefully controlled celebration at Swift’s Rhode Island estate, a place known for privacy and tight security. The move makes sense. Kelce remains in the thick of his NFL career, while Swift balances touring commitments with long term personal planning.Recent news has focused on how Kelce is becoming more at ease in the public eye, from fans supporting her during Swift's Eras Tour to her open comments about wanting to build a future together.The setting in Rhode Island gives you control, privacy, and space from the craziness of global fans.That change in venue weakens the case for surprise guest theories, including any Styles appearance. Still, history keeps fans invested. Styles once reflected on young love and fame, saying, “Relationships are hard, at any age. And adding in that you don’t really understand exactly how it works when you’re 18, trying to navigate all that stuff didn’t make it easier.” Years later, he acknowledged Swift’s craft with a simple truth: “Using Taylor as an example, she’s a great songwriter. So at least they’re good songs.”Those words underline where things stand now. Mutual respect replaced old drama long ago. With Swift and Kelce focused on their next chapter, the wedding story is less about past relationships and more about how two modern icons are shaping a future on their own terms. Fans may keep guessing, but the reality looks far calmer than the theories suggest.","Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift’s upcoming wedding sparks unexpected Harry Styles chatter. Early rumors suggested an Italian venue, but new reports say the couple will marry at Swift's Rhode Island estate.

Brittany Mahomes’ new look ignites fierce fan reaction after SI Swimsuit cover

The conversation around Brittany Mahomes shifted fast and loudly once her Sports Illustrated Swimsuit digital cover dropped. What began as praise for a career milestone quickly turned into a heated debate about appearance, body changes, and why public figures still face intense scrutiny for how they look. Fans did not just react. They argued. Loudly.Timelines filled with commentary that went both in favor of and against the shoot spread as images on the shoot got online. The reaction showed how quickly celebration can morph into controversy when fame, gender, and sports culture collide in one viral moment.Since becoming one of the most visible women in the NFL orbit, Brittany Mahomes has often been discussed in ways that go far beyond football. Her latest cover pushed that tension into the open again. While many applauded her confidence after motherhood, others focused on physical changes, reviving speculation she has never addressed publicly.Much of the backlash played out in replies to a viral post, where users dissected Brittany’s appearance with little restraint. Some comments framed the changes as ideological, others as cosmetic, and several crossed into crude territory.One user wrote, “That’s what turning red pill will do! Make women normal again!” Another comment took a more graphic turn, saying, “Yes, glad she got to see the doctor and get some nice titties added in there! Pat deserves this”A third reply leaned into age-based judgment, posting, “Yeah, she got older mate, that usually happens” The most shared reaction packaged the criticism as humor, with one account writing, “Patty went to the store and brought back MILK JUGS”Together, the comments revealed how quickly online discussion drifted away from professional achievement toward body policing. Supporters pushed back, pointing out that Brittany has carried three pregnancies and has been open about embracing confidence later in life.Others compared the fight to the times when athletes such as Simone Biles addressed the topic of cosmetic preferences and turned the shame into self-control.It is not a one-view reaction that this reaction actually revealed, but a pattern that is present. When female athletes who are associated with sports venture into the limelight on their own terms, the reaction usually speaks more about the audience than it does about the subject.Brittany did not address the chatter, but the fan reaction ensured the moment would be remembered as more than just a cover shoot.",Brittany Mahomes’ 2026 Sports Illustrated Swimsuit digital cover sparked intense online debate.

Fans dissect Taylor Swift’s rumored wedding dress details as Travis Kelce links spark buzz

Even months after the first whispers surfaced, fans are still unpacking every detail tied to Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce’s wedding plans. There is one rumor, which is not disappearing. The fact that Swift was married in a dress that quietly alluded to Kelce has Swifties chatting many hours after the first news broke.This rumor started to gain momentum at the end of 2025, when it started being rumored that Swift would meet with celebrated designer Sarah Burton. Fans did not take it as gossip and more like a puzzle. For a fandom trained to read symbolism, the dress was never just fabric. It was a message.According to sources at the time, Swift wanted a gown that balanced tradition with personal meaning. One insider explained, “Her choice of gown will set bridal trends for years to come. Taylor knows this and sees the dress as part of the story she’s telling. She’s being deliberate. She wants a design that respects her past but also captures her life with Travis – it’s a hugely significant moment for both of them, and Taylor is intent on that being seen in her gown choice. ”That framing sent fans straight to social media. Fashion focused Swifties pointed to Burton’s history, especially her work on Princess Catherine’s wedding dress, as proof Swift was thinking globally. One viral post read, “Prince William & Princess Catherine had some of the most beautiful photos of their royal wedding ❤️💙 The most glorious wedding of the decade 👑💕”Others zoomed in on Burton’s résumé, sharing throwbacks and praise. Another widely shared post declared, “the end of a beautiful era 🤍 a polaroid of sarah burton when she was still an intern for alexander mcqueen, photographed here at his studio back in 1996”Fans also highlighted Burton’s modern designs for red carpet icons.One tweet gushed, “ADORE: Cynthia Erivo in a custom ✨Givenchy✨ by Sarah Burton in Paris.🪡”while another added, “cate blanchett in givenchy by sarah burton at the fashion awards.”As the conversation aged, it became less about confirmation and more about meaning.Swift herself once admitted, “You would think that I had been the type of person who would have obsessed over the idea of a wedding my whole life, but I actually never thought about what I would ever do or what I would want until I met the person.”For fans, that quote still anchors the theory. Whether or not the dress carries hidden nods to Kelce, the reaction shows how deeply Swift’s audience connects love, storytelling, and design into one evolving narrative.","Taylor Swift's wedding dress may include subtle nods to Travis Kelce.

My two cents on the trade

Thehave worked really hard to come close to the Western Conference in February 2026. This feat is greatly attributed to Luka Doncic’s production. At the same time, the Brooklyn Nets have shifted toward a rebuild. The team waived, and he later signed a non-guaranteed deal with the Milwaukee Bucks.Because of that move, a trade between the Lakers and Nets for Thomas is no longer possible. Still, the idea of pairing him with Doncic is worth examining. It shows what both teams may have wanted and what they could have gained or lost.Looking back at how a deal might have worked also helps explain the choices contenders face when deciding between immediate help and future assets.Key rotation players still on the roster include:• Luka Doncic - PG/SG, 26, averaging 32.8 points, 7.8 rebounds, and 8.6 assists with a 61.6% true shooting rate.• LeBron James - SF/PF, 41, still a primary scorer and playmaker.• Austin Reaves - SG, 27, reliable secondary scorer and floor spacer.• Marcus Smart - PG/SG, 31, defensive leader and facilitator.• Rui Hachimura, Jarred Vanderbilt, Maxi Kleber, Deandre Ayton, Dalton Knecht, Nick Smith Jr.,Bronny James, and others.After waiving Thomas, Brooklyn’s core includes:• Nic Claxton - C, 26, defensive anchor.• Michael Porter Jr. - SF, 27, main scoring option.• Terance Mann, Tyrese Martin, Ziaire Williams, Jalen Wilson, Day’Ron Sharpe.• Young guards Egor Demin, Ben Saraf, and Nolan Traore.Thomas is no longer part of the Nets roster following his move to Milwaukee.Before the waiver, a possible structure may have been:• Cam Thomas, a 24-year-old scoring guard on a $6 million expiring contract.Nets receive (example package):• A future first-round pick or swap.• Young players such as Nick Smith Jr. and Dalton Knecht.• A smaller contract like Luke Kennard or Maxi Kleber to match salary.This setup would have allowed the Lakers to remain below the luxury tax while giving the Nets additional pieces for their rebuild.Thomas is known for scoring. He can create his own shot and handle late-clock situations, which are areas where the Lakers’ bench has lacked consistency.• Age: Thomas is 24, Doncic is 26. Both are in their prime years.• Size: Each has enough length to fit into multiple lineup combinations.• Style: Doncic controls the offense and creates for others. Thomas focuses on getting points and can take over stretches of a game.Together, they could have given the Lakers another scoring option when defenses focused on Doncic or when LeBron was off the floor.• More young players and draft capital.• A chance to reset the roster after reported role and fit concerns.• Added salary flexibility.• Letting go of a proven scorer who averaged 24.0 points as a starter in 2024-25 and has nine career 40-point games.• Possible negative reaction from fans who supported a homegrown player.• Immediate scoring from the bench.• Shot creation that is useful in playoff settings.• Upside at age 24.• Limited financial risk because the contract was expiring.• Defensive weaknesses.• A ball-dominant style that might have affected touches for Doncic and LeBron.• Questions about locker-room fit on a veteran team.• The cost of giving up young players who could develop into rotation pieces.The Lakers add a strong scorer next to Doncic without hurting their financial flexibility. The Nets gain picks and young talent to support their rebuild.The fit does not work in Los Angeles, and the team gives up long-term pieces for a short-term move. Brooklyn risks watching a young scorer succeed elsewhere.Before the waiver, trading for Cam Thomas would have been a move with clear upside and real risk for the Lakers. If he adjusted to playing alongside Doncic and accepted the team structure under JJ Redick, the pairing could have strengthened the offense for a playoff run.If the fit failed, the Nets likely would have benefited by turning an expiring contract into future assets while the Lakers lost developmental players.Also read: NBA trade rumors: Golden State Warriors predicted to land $3.63 million Memphis Grizzlies guard; reunion with Stephen Curry could influence 2026 playoff push Thomas is now in Milwaukee, so any interest from the Lakers would have to wait until the offseason unless a sign-and-trade becomes possible. Even so, the idea of Doncic and Thomas sharing a backcourt remains one of the more interesting alternate scenarios from the 2025-26 season.","The Los Angeles Lakers have worked hard to come close to the Western Conference in February 2026.

My final thoughts on this mock trade

Themay look to the buyout market to strengthen their bench before the playoffs, andhas surfaced as a possible option. His situation changed quickly at the trade deadline, and he is now expected to become available if he clears waivers.Golden State still runs its offense through Stephen Curry, but the roster could use another experienced perimeter shooter who understands spacing and playoff basketball. If Gordon reaches free agency, the Warriors have both the roster space and financial room to consider a short-term deal.Eric Gordon is no longer connected to the Houston Rockets. He was traded from the Philadelphia 76ers to the Memphis Grizzlies at the deadline, and Memphis waived him to remove his $2.3 million cap hit. After the 48-hour waiver period, he can sign with any team if unclaimed.The Warriors have been linked to several veteran buyout candidates, and Gordon is viewed as one of the players who could fill their final roster spot. This would not involve a trade. Instead, it would likely be a minimum-salary signing that places the 37-year-old alongside Curry after years of competing against him.Memphis placed Eric Gordon on waivers, giving teams two days to claim his contract.If no team does, he becomes an unrestricted free agent.Golden State has about one open roster slot following recent additions such as Pat Spencer and Quinten Post, so no corresponding move would be required. Even as a tax-paying team, the Warriors can manage Gordon’s $2,296,274 salary as a depth addition.The Golden State Warriors do not have many off-ball guards who can consistently stretch the floor without slowing ball movement. Gordon fits that role.He has averaged 15.2 points and 2.7 assists across 931 career games and has long been known as a catch-and-shoot threat. Gordon has played 18 NBA seasons and was part of several deep playoff runs with Houston, which aligns with Golden State’s focus on competing now. The cost is low and does not affect long-term planning.During a brief stretch with Philadelphia in the 2025–26 season, Gordon shot 57.1% from the field in six games, showing he can still contribute in limited minutes.Curry’s game depends on movement and spacing, and Gordon supports both. He is a career 37% three-point shooter who can make teams pay for sending extra defenders toward Curry.Gordon has built a reputation as a player defenders cannot leave alone, which helps create driving lanes for Curry and Jimmy Butler. At this stage of his career, he is comfortable coming off the bench and shooting without needing the ball often. Placing him behind Brandin Podziemski and Buddy Hield could help stabilize second-unit scoring.• Adds spacing and reduces defensive pressure on Curry and Butler• Brings playoff experience, including Houston’s 2018 Western Conference Finals run against Golden State• Requires only a small financial commitment• Durability is a concern at age 37, likely limiting him to about 15–20 minutes per game• No longer a strong defender and could be targeted in switches• Golden State already has several guards, which could make minutes harder to distributeGordon was born on December 25, 1988, and is in his 18th NBA season after playing for Houston, the Clippers, the Suns, the 76ers, and Memphis. He is a right-handed shooting guard listed at about 6-foot-3 and 215 pounds. While he has enough strength to handle contact, he is not suited to guard top perimeter scorers.If he joins Golden State, his role would likely be clear: a bench scorer playing around 15–20 minutes, a three-point specialist who works off screens, and a veteran presence for younger guards such as Podziemski, Will Richard, and Spencer.Golden State Warriors would add an experienced shooter who fits into its system without changing the core rotation. If healthy, Gordon could help in close playoff games.For Gordon, the move would offer another chance to compete for a title in a defined role. Philadelphia cleared luxury-tax space with the trade, while Memphis gained a future second-round pick swap, making the decision largely financial for both teams.The Golden State Warriors’ interest is still a rumor, but the fit makes sense. A team that needs shooting and experience could address both with a low-cost signing.Also read: NBA trade rumors: Los Angeles Lakers predicted to sign $186 million Milwaukee Bucks superstar to form Big 3 with LeBron James and Luka Doncic If Gordon clears waivers and Golden State signs him, the move would be practical. It would give the Warriors another reliable shooter while keeping their roster flexible for the postseason.","Eric Gordon was traded from the Philadelphia 76ers to the Memphis Grizzlies at the deadline.

"World Chess Championship: Fair Play Officer found job easier due to D Gukesh, Ding Liren’s impeccable behaviour",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/chess/world-chess-championship-fair-play-officer-found-job-easier-due-to-d-gukesh-ding-lirens-impeccable-behaviour/articleshow/116329998.cms,"D Gukesh vs Ding Liren (PTI Photo)

In the high-pressure crucible of the World Chess Championship , it wasn’t just the brilliance of D Gukesh ’s moves that left an indelible mark – it was his unwavering poise under tense situations that etched an unforgettable impression. The 18-year-old prodigy played not only with his mind but also with his heart, fighting every battle as though the board was a stage and he, the lead actor in a drama of unyielding resolve.Yet, it was his demeanour, as much as his daring, that caught the attention of those who observed him up close. Aleksandar Colovik , the Fair Play Officer of the blue-ribbon event tasked with ensuring the tournament’s integrity, noted that his job was made easier because of how well-behaved both Gukesh and former champion Ding Liren were.“They are very similar in many ways – both cultured and well-mannered. They both shook their legs when nervous, but in different ways. They were also very cooperative and kind. True gentlemen,” Aleksandar told TOI.In a world where chess geniuses often arrive wrapped in eccentricity, the Chennai teen has stood apart. Even in moments of extreme pressure, Gukesh maintained an aura of focus. Aleksandar, who observed every move with the precision of a hawk, quickly identified the quality that set Gukesh apart.“Actually, I was really impressed by Gukesh’s constant desire to put up a fight. I think Garry Kasparov or someone had said, ‘In a match between two players, the fighter always wins.’ Gukesh was the better fighter in this tournament. If you look at the games, when Ding was playing with the white pieces, he often avoided a fight. He wanted to be safe – wanted a draw.""But Gukesh wasn’t doing that. He took it to the extreme, avoiding a draw even in positions where he was objectively worse. This characteristic of being a true fighter, not shying away from a challenge, was the main difference that decided the champion,” said Aleksandar, a seasoned Fair Play Officer with extensive experience in events like the Grand Prix and the Candidates Tournament.After the victory, Gukesh praised his 32-year-old opponent, calling him a “true champion” and expressing his admiration. “I would also love to thank my opponent, Ding Liren. He is, in my eyes, a true champion, and we saw that despite a lot of pressure on him, he was able to put up a huge fight. I really admire you,” Gukesh said during the closing ceremony. This graciousness, especially at just 18, added to the impression of a young champion defined not only by his moves but also by his character.Meanwhile, Russian Chess Federation president Andrei Filatov has questioned the way Ding lost to Gukesh, calling for an investigation by FIDE . In response, Aleksandar remarked, “That blunder didn’t come out of nowhere. I mean, this was a long, gruelling game where Gukesh was pressing and pushing, while Ding just wanted the game to end. He was a few moves away, thinking nothing could go wrong, but then he messed up. After almost a month of constant pressure, people crack. That’s normal.”The officer’s role in the tournament was both challenging and rewarding, especially in an era where technology has blurred the lines of fair play. “Players were scanned before entering the play area, passing through different types of scanners to ensure they didn’t have any devices on them or their body. I also ensured no signals entered the glass cube. I really enjoyed it. I knew that maybe I’m becoming part of history here,” Aleksandar explained.",D Gukesh beat Ding Liren to win the World Chess Championship. Fair Play Officer Aleksandar Colovik said the Chennai teen was the better fighter in the tournament.

Former Aussie gloveman and explosive bat,

talks to TOI about what makes India's wicketkeeper so special with bat in hand, how he would have played Bumrah and why most big players struggle to say goodbye...

BRISBANE: The media and broadcast enclosures here at the Gabba are tightly packed units, buzzing with activity, trailing loops of wires and heavy equipment. Connecting them is a narrow, winding, claustrophobic corridor with barely room for two to walk alongside. It's like being inside a space shuttle.This is the engine room of the Gabba, and it is here that Adam Gilchrist, Australia's iconic cricketer who redefined the role of a wicketkeeper-batter, has agreed to talk cricket. He seeks out a quiet corner. There is none. As he talks, people jostle past him. None of that matters because Gilchrist is talking about his favourite person, Shane Warne , the leg spinner with the gift who isn't with us anymore.""I miss Warney so much,"" he tells TOI, then repeats for emphasis, ""A great deal. Him and Andrew Symonds and Rod Marsh . We like to talk about them because it means we keep their legacy and spirit alive. You know, keeping wickets to Shane Warne was the highlight of my cricketing career.""The highlight? This is Adam Gilchrist, one of the world's most-loved cricketers, now or in his playing days. The marauder with bat in hand who made the best of bowlers look pedestrian. The white-ball belter who marched alongside Matthew Hayden to open, then proceeded to carve games open as Australia won three World Cups.The explosive No. 7 in Tests who scored at a strike rate of 81.95 and scored 17 hundreds. The trailblazer who waited long to be picked for the longer format, then announced his intentions early, in just his second Test, with an unforgettable, unbeaten second-innings 149 in Hobart against Pakistan to fashion a chase of 369 runs.Then there was Gilchrist the safe wicketkeeper, the one who eased into Ian Healy's big shoes and then reshaped the role. There was the stand-in captain too, the one who conquered the final frontier by fashioning a series win in India. Listing all of Gilchrist's achievements could take all day, but that's not what's on his mind.It was the best thing I did in cricket, keeping wickets to Warney,"" he continues, matter-of-factly. ""He was okay for me to pick him out of the hand. I could read him from the hand, but that didn't mean they were easy takes for me. With the same action and delivery, he spun some big, he spun some small. It was great fun. I had the best seat in the house when he bowled.""So, was Warne the greatest modern era spinner? Gilchrist gives the impression he doesn't like such comparisons. ""I can only speak from my experience. I played against Murali. I played against Anil (Kumble). Harbhajan was hard for me, I had challenging times against Harbhajan. But I think Warnie was the greatest all-round cricketer that I've played with. His bowling, even his batting, his catching, his cricket mind, he was right up there, clearly one of the best spinners. He was such a great character.""Talking about characters, Gilchrist's current favourite is Rishabh Pant , and we move on quickly to the ongoing series as rain pelts the Gabba on Day One of the third Test. Maybe he sees a bit of himself in Pant , an explosive wicketkeeper-batter who can keep the Gilchrist flame burning?Gilly's eyes light up. ""He's a miracle, isn't he? I watched on like the rest of the world, how nasty the accident was. The initial outlook didn't look fantastic, but he's worked some magic. Clearly a lot of dedication and hard work has gone into his recovery. Now to see him back on the field is wonderful,"" he says, then declares unequivocally: ""Pant is the most entertaining cricketer in the world right now.""What is it about Pant that makes him so special? Gilchrist thinks for a few seconds, smiles and shakes his head as if impressed. ""Well, we saw glimpses of that in Adelaide, didn't we? You're not sure what you're going to get from him. What you do know is that he entertains. What I admire is his ability to go from defence to offence so quickly. He can look really calm and composed and then all of a sudden, almost stealth-like, he'll attack the bowler, catch him off-guard. That's a great quality. I've never played that falling scoop even in my backyard! I never even thought about it!""Gilchrist isn't too concerned that Pant has been inconsistent of late. ""It's not that big (of a problem). He hasn't played a huge amount of cricket. I asked him about his leg, 'keeping-wise, and he didn't seem to think it was too much trouble. It was just about the recovery, making sure he puts ice on his knee every day. I used to do that too, and I never had the accident. For him to have his knee rebuilt, it must be challenging, but I think he's really making a good fist of it. We've got to give him time.""Also, his playing style is such that there'll be patches when he won't be consistent. I was a bit similar. I was an attacking player. That (inconsistency) comes with the territory, like Travis Head . There'll be times when it won't work, and people will say he's being too attacking, but I think Pant should play his natural way. That's the way he'll get the best results. Be patient with him and trust that he'll deliver more than he doesn't deliver.""Pant isn't the only Indian cricketer to have charmed Australia's cricket-loving masses on this tour, and this seems a good time to sneak the Jasprit Bumrah question in. How would 'Gilly' in his prime take down Bumrah? Could he even?""I'm not too sure,"" Gilchrist says, wide-eyed, and his mind goes back to his problems against Andrew Flintoff bowling around the wicket. ""I faced Flintoff in his prime in 2005. As a left-hander it was very similar angles (to Bumrah), and that was really challenging.""Somehow, you've got to try and find a way. You don't have to be ultra-aggressive, just tick over the scoreboard a little bit, don't get caught at the crease for too many of Bumrah's deliveries in a row. Bumrah, if he can bowl two or three overs to the same batter, he can get accurate enough to try and create a chance. Just keep getting off strike!"" Would the squash ball in his glove help? ""Who knows,"" he chortles.Gilchrist closed his chapter in a hurry at 96 Tests, walking away the moment he felt things weren't quite the same and late-career struggles started overwhelming the mind. Does he think most ageing batting stalwarts stick around longer even as their powers wane, in vain hope of a final hurrah or a few more years at the top? How did 'Gilly' himself feel about things at the end?""Well, I retired,"" he says, bluntly. ""I just got out of there. I knew as soon as I dropped VVS Laxman it was time for me to go (in Adelaide, Jan 2008, Gilchrist's last Test). A lot of these players, when they hit that age, it just starts to drop off a bit. I went into my last Test having no idea I was going to retire. And then I dropped a catch off that bloke's bowling!""Gilchrist points to pace legend Brett Lee, who is smiling quietly in the corner. Lee has been listening in for a while now, and chimes in, ""He's only ever dropped one in his life!""With that, it's time to go, just like Gilchrist did all those years ago, but he still wants the last word on the issue. ""Mother Nature plays its part. I can't comment for anyone else apart from myself."" And on that note, Adam Gilchrist, once-destroyer of worlds, disappears into the labyrinths of the Gabba.",Former Aussie gloveman and explosive bat Adam Gilchrist talks to TOI about what makes India's wicketkeeper so special with bat in hand.

BRISBANE: Judging from the little play that was possible on Day One of the third Test, India would have hoped for a better effort from their pacers. The big surprise, though, came at the toss as Rohit Sharma called right again and opted to field first.No doubt, the batting unit wears a fragile look and that might have played a big part in the decision. First-innings top-order collapses have been a regular feature for India on this tour. The batting concerns also showed in the inclusion of Ravindra Jadeja in place of Ravichandran Ashwin in the XI.On the face of it, the decision seems a cautious one. The overcast conditions and threat of impending rain no doubt would have influenced the team management, but fielding first brings with it its own set of concerns. First off, it puts the new-ball bowlers under immediate pressure. It showed in Mohammed Siraj 's unimpressive first spell as the Australian crowd continued its booing whenever he came on.This was the first time since 2014 that India have bowled first in an away Test. The last time India fielded first after winning the toss in Australia also came at the Gabba, back in 2003 under Sourav Ganguly 's captaincy.India would have been disappointed with what they discovered once proceedings began. There wasn't much swing on offer and the spongy bounce ensured Australia's openers were content to sit back. It is only when the sun shines that the pitch is expected to get faster. The pacers were also guilty of not bowling a bit fuller, near the 5m mark, to induce the batters forward.When the first rain delay came 5.3 overs in, Australia were 19/0, with both Khawaja and McSweeney content to bide their time. In that period, 58% of India's deliveries were short. Once play resumed, India seemed to have got the hang of it.Akash Deep, who as expected replaced Harshit Rana, looked penetrative, bowling fuller and getting a hint of away swing. Bumrah got Khawaja to square up a few times. The signs were promising when the second, and final, rain break came, with Australia 28/0 in 13.2 overs.The forecast isn't all that optimistic for Sunday either, but if the openers can negotiate the morning session safely on Day Two, Australia can start thinking big. It is important for India to make the most of the new ball from here on.",Rohit Sharma opts to field first after winning the toss at the Gabba.

Afghanistan secured a thrilling three-wicket victory over Zimbabwe in the third T20I at Harare Sports Club on Saturday. Veteran all-rounder Mohammad Nabi played a crucial role, smashing seven runs off three balls in the final over to clinch the series 2-1.Nabi's heroics included a four, a two, and a single in the last over, adding to the excitement following Afghanistan's 50-run win the previous day.Nabi remained unbeaten on 24, the second-highest score for Afghanistan. Fellow all-rounder Azmatullah Omarzai top-scored with 34 and also claimed two wickets.Zimbabwe set a target of 128 after being bowled out for 127 in 19.5 overs. Afghanistan reached the target with three balls to spare, marking their sixth consecutive T20I series win against Zimbabwe.""In the middle of our innings we lost some wickets cheaply which put pressure on us,"" Nabi told reporters.""But I managed to control my nerves and that gave me the confidence to go on and score the series-winning runs.""Next up is the one-day international series and this wicket is not easy to judge. The pitch for the first two games was better -- today it was up and down.""Afghan captain Rashid Khan continued his streak of winning the toss, opting to field first in this decisive match. This was a change in tactics compared to the earlier matches where Afghanistan had chosen to bat first.Rashid showcased his bowling prowess, taking 4-27, while Zimbabwean opener Brian Bennett led his team's batting with 31 runs, which included four boundaries.Afghanistan faced a challenging chase, stumbling to 44-4. A crucial 48-run partnership between Omarzai and Gulbadin Naib (22) revived their hopes.The tourists appeared to be in control until Omarzai was dismissed by Sikandar Raza with 13 balls left. This briefly gave Zimbabwe a glimmer of hope.However, Naib's quickfire 18-ball innings, featuring three fours, extinguished Zimbabwe's chances and secured the victory for Afghanistan.The two teams will now face each other in a three-match ODI series in Harare, starting on Tuesday.

NEW DELHI: Harbhajan Singh minces no words in slamming Australian players as the former India off-spinner has now accused legendary Australian wicket-keeper Adam Gilchrist for his involvement in cheating against India in the 2007-08 tour.Harbhajan criticised Gilchrist, stating that he was not a ""gentleman cricketer"" and had been involved in cheating. He urged fans to stop idolising the former Australian wicketkeeper-batter as a saint.The infamous Sydney Test in 2008 between India and Australia was marred by controversies especially regarding umpiring decisions.During the match, Rahul Dravid was controversially dismissed after missing a straight ball from Andrew Symonds. Gilchrist immediately claimed the wicket, and Dravid was given out. The batter was stunned, and replays confirmed there was no edge, indicating the umpire made an error in judgment. This decision led to a heated debate over the fairness of the call.""He is often praised for walking off after nicking the ball. For me, he was not a saint, and we should stop praising him. He was also involved in cheating against India in that Sydney Test. He knew that Dravid didn't nick the ball but still claimed the catch. It was because of him the umpire declared the batter out. If he was so good, why did he appeal on that day?,"" Harbhajan said on Star Sports""On one hand he used to walk off to show the world that he was a good person, but on the other hand, he was involved in cheating. India were not playing against 11 players on that but against 13 ( two umpires).

Matthew Hayden's daughter Grace: Loves dal and roti, is a big fan of Rishabh Pant

NEW DELHI: West Indies skipper Hayley Matthews has observed that women's T20 cricket is becoming increasingly competitive, with lower-ranked teams showing improvement.She expressed her team's commitment to deliver their best performance in the T20Is against India, scheduled to begin in Navi Mumbai on Sunday.Despite India's disappointing group stage exit from the October T20 World Cup, West Indies, ranked sixth globally, advanced to the semifinal before losing to eventual runners-up New Zealand.""They're the top four for a reason because they probably are a better team and have better records. But at the same time I feel like every team is really starting to compete now,"" Matthews commented regarding the perceived gap between higher and lower-ranked teams.She further noted at Saturday's post-training media session, ""When you look at a World Cup like just now the one that we played, you had no idea who would have beaten who in every single match.""""I'm pretty sure no one had it to be a final four of West Indies, South Africa, New Zealand and Australia. Probably, no one had a final of New Zealand and South Africa settled as well. It just shows that the women's game is getting more and more competitive. I feel like the teams towards the bottom are starting to climb up,"" she added.Matthews acknowledged that whilst West Indies, who clinched the 2016 T20 World Cup, experienced an extended transition period, they have now established themselves as a cohesive unit.Addressing their eight-match losing streak against India, Matthews stated, ""We were going through some type of transitioning period within the team and our record against anyone probably wasn't the best throughout that period.""""We've been working really hard and been really focused on our game and what we can improve. Coming up against a team like India, we know it is going to be a tough assignment. But we have been playing some really positive cricket over the last year and back ourselves to hopefully go out there and be able to change things around a bit.""With nine victories in 13 T20Is this year, West Indies have shown strong form.

Emiliano Martinez , Aston Villa 's goalkeeper, made a remarkable save during their match against Nottingham Forest in the Premier League on Saturday. Albeit, the game ended in a 2-1 loss for Aston Villa.In the 60th minute, Nicolas Dominguez's header seemed destined for the net. Martinez, slightly off his line, extended his left hand backward. He managed to deflect the ball downward and scoop it away from the goal line in one fluid motion.“World class,” was how the Premier League described the save.The BBC considered it potentially ""one of the all-time great Premier League saves.”“I can’t think of a better Premier League save,” said former England and Liverpool midfielder Jamie Redknapp, who was working the game for British broadcaster Sky Sports. “It’s almost like a magician with his sleight of hand.”Jhon Duran scored for Aston Villa shortly after, giving them a temporary lead. This goal came just three minutes after Martinez's incredible save.Nottingham Forest responded with two late goals, securing a 2-1 victory. Both goals were scored after the 87th minute.Martinez has received recognition for his goalkeeping prowess. He was named the best goalkeeper at the Ballon d'Or awards for the past two years.In the 2022 World Cup final, Martinez made a crucial save against Randal Kolo Muani in the final seconds of extra time. This save allowed Argentina to hold on and eventually win the World Cup. The save was instrumental in Lionel Messi achieving his dream of winning a World Cup title.","Aston Villa goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez made a stellar save against Nottingham Forest in the English Premier League.

This Sunday's Manchester derby at Etihad Stadium sees both Manchester City and Manchester United hoping for a much-needed win after recent difficulties.City's recent form has been surprisingly poor. They've managed just one victory in their last ten matches across all competitions, a slump that began in late October. Their record stands at eight wins, four losses, and three draws, totaling 27 points.League performances have shown slight improvement recently. City defeated Nottingham Forest 3-0 on December 4th and drew 2-2 against Crystal Palace on December 7th. Kevin De Bruyne 's return from injury has been a boost for City. He started in both of those matches, his first starts since mid-September, and contributed a goal and an assist against Nottingham Forest. However, Rodri remains sidelined for the season.Despite these improvements, the four-time defending champions find themselves in an unusual fourth place in the league table. They are eight points behind leaders Liverpool , who also have a game in hand. A 2-0 midweek Champions League loss to Juventus further complicates their situation, putting their knockout-round qualification at risk with two group stage matches remaining.“The soul and spirit of this team is there.”“I'm sad for the players because of the way they run and fight in the circumstances. And, of course, our fans maybe they're sad (right now). I understand it -- we're not used to it.”Manchester United, currently 13th in the table with five wins, six losses, and four draws, resulting in 19 points, will be under the guidance of Ruben Amorim in his first Manchester derby. Amorim took charge of United last month.Amorim's last encounter with City was a memorable one. He led Sporting Lisbon to a 4-1 victory over City in a Champions League match, one of his final games in charge of the Portuguese club.Amorim's tenure at United has seen one win in four league games. This win was a convincing 4-0 home victory against Everton on December 1st. Marcus Rashford and Joshua Zirkzee both scored twice in that match.Since then, Rashford has lost his starting position under Amorim. Amorim has significant experience with derby matches, having managed Sporting Lisbon and played for their rivals, Benfica.Amorim acknowledges that this derby might feel different due to both teams' current struggles.“Yeah, I'm really focused on the details. I just want to improve the team, so I cannot live it like a normal derby, like it should be - two great teams fighting for the title.”“And it's not that in this moment. So it's just one more game with a very good opponent. Both teams are struggling in the moment, so I hope, in the future, I feel that real feeling of a derby.”","Manchester City and Manchester United meet in the Manchester derby on Sunday.

Andre Agassi

believes Djokovic will miss Federer & Nadal, the guys he came to the dance with

Excerpts:

Djokovic's longevity:

Andy Murray coaching Djokovic:

Carlos Alcaraz

and longevity…

American men haven't had results like the women:

Graf was the hardest victory I ever had: Agassi

BENGALURU: Andre Agassi wondered if the 24-time major winner Novak Djokovic would miss his greatest rivals -- the now-retired Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer -- in the last leg of a glittering career where the 37-year-old goes for more history.The eight-time Grand Slam champion, in the city for the TiE Global Summit, assessed Djokovic's run and the Serb's recent partnership with friend and rival Andy Murray in a candid chat with media.It's hard to say, Father Time always wins. He has already done so much for so long, it's hard to imagine longer. We said that about (Roger) Federer too. I think Novak will run out of energy more than capability. Cannot be easy, especially when the people you came to the dance with have left, that's a big thing.When Pete (Sampras) retired it was a blow to me, it set me back a little bit. It made me rediscover my inspirations on some level. Djokovic has lost the guys he made history with. It'll probably get tougher and tougher emotionally, but I would never bet against them. Bet against them at your peril.In any coach-student relationship you need trust and trust can take time, but it's nice when it starts with believing in somebody because you know that they know your experience. There's an asset to their history as competitors.Any success of a relationship is based on complete buy-in and that's always the part you have to wait and see. It's not what I know that changes your career, information doesn't lead to transformation, somebody has to counter that. That's the connector. I'm sure there's going to be a lot of trust immediately, we'll see how the results go.Alcaraz defends like Novak, has more power and spin like Nadal, hands and finesse like Federer but just because he has the best of all the three doesn't mean he can do what they did. There are so many parts to the game such as decision-making, injuries, luck. So how long can (Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner) do it (for)? They could do it for 20 years or not.The women's game hasn't had to deal with Roger Federer, Novak Djokovic, Rafael, Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz, but they have their version of it. Serena Williams is the Novak of the women's game and you got Coco as a potential, like Alcaraz has potential and Sinner has potential.How the game evolves is interesting. The women's game has gotten very powerful, just straight power. For lack of a better example, Lindsay Davenport was powerful, tall, precise through the court and now you have a lot of that. There's still room for somebody who can offset that kind of power, like an Ash Barty.The men's game has changed in the sense that guys have gotten bigger with longer levers, which means they're better athletes, they can move and they need more time, they start playing further back. Soon you're going to start seeing the net game start coming back, everything morphs in its own way. But the biggest issue for American (men) not winning is an unfortunate set of decades where the guys were very stingy and very greedy -- 66 Grand Slams in the same generation. There's not a lot left there (for others)!Andre Agassi - the second of five men to achieve a career Grand Slam in the Open Era and the first man to complete a career golden slam - has won it all, including a stirring love match.""She was the hardest victory I ever had,"" said Agassi of his wife German tennis legend Steffi Graf, a 22-time major winner.Agassi, who has won eight major titles and the Olympic gold, speaking during a session at the TiE Global Summit, said, ""We all live a hero's journey - first part of life is about performing and achieving. Then life hits us with broken relationships and dreams. I went through it all. Finally, in the last phase of the journey, it's about serving others.""The 54-year-old said, ""At 28 my (tennis) career started over. Without the struggles, I would've never gotten Steffi to say yes. I tried to get her for years.""On a lighter note, Agassi said he likes to keep his trophies out of the house. ""I don't bring my trophies home, because if I bring my trophies home, then she brings her trophies home - and that's bad math!""",Andre Agassi believes Novak Djokovic will run out of energy more than capability.

NEW DELHI: Legendary player Andre Agassi observed that Carlos Alcaraz embodies distinct qualities from Novak Djokovic Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal , while advising the tennis world against anticipating the young Spaniard to match the extraordinary achievements of these tennis legends.The collective Grand Slam victories of Federer, Nadal and Djokovic stand at 66, whilst Alcaraz, aged 21, has secured four major titles thus far.""I'm not a genius and I don't have a crystal ball.

I think he'll run out of the energy for it more than the capability of it, I would imagine.""It cannot be easy, especially when the people you came to the dance with have left.""The American provided additional context to his assessment.""When Pete (Sampras) retired, it was a blow to me.

NEW DELHI: Tennis icon Andre Agassi on Tuesday highlighted how sports should remain integral to education, noting their role in teaching children to cope with defeat.At a Bengaluru event focussed on sports and education's role in fostering excellence, Agassi shared his insights.""Even when you have a failure, you have to get up and play again the next day. So, what sports is teaching you is that focusing on winning and losing is really a distraction from what we need to be thinking about. We need to be thinking about how to get better,"" he said.Since 2001, Agassi has invested in education for underprivileged children, establishing 130 schools serving approximately 80,000 students in the United States. He attributes this achievement to his persistent drive to overcome obstacles.His demanding tennis career shaped his ability to maintain focus and adapt when necessary.""Sports is all about problem-solving. Tennis taught me how to navigate a very intense environment and maintain my objectivity and problem-solving abilities. It forces me to be present, but also to understand the context of what I'm doing,"" Agassi said.Regarding his earlier defiant period, Agassi acknowledged it as a necessary phase in his journey.""Vulnerability is essential for growth, and I think vulnerability eventually leads to humility,"" he added.He recognised technology's crucial role in education, particularly in providing individualised learning opportunities for children. This belief influenced his investment in the Indian EdTech company, Square Panda .""I think technology can play an essential role, not just in scalability, but also in optimising personalised learning. That's why I got involved with Square Panda.

If I stay fit, then why not?”While the Los Angeles Olympics are a long-term goal, Sindhu intends to participate if she remains fit. She defeated China's Wu Luo Yu in the Syed Modi International final, securing her third title in this tournament. Her previous wins were in 2017 and 2022.“I'm very happy that I'm finishing off with a win. Now it's time to just go back, relax, and start again from January. I hope this is a comeback, and I'm looking forward to many more victories.”Sindhu expresses her happiness at ending the year with a victory. She plans to rest and prepare for upcoming tournaments in Malaysia, India, Indonesia, and Thailand.“I'll be playing the upcoming tournaments in Malaysia, India, Indonesia, and Thailand. Obviously, we'll have to pick and choose tournaments because I'll have to be smart enough to decide what to play and what not. I need to be much smarter in terms of that.”Sindhu will carefully select tournaments to manage her schedule and fitness. Her previous title was at the Singapore Open in July 2022. She was also a finalist at the Malaysia Masters Super 500 earlier this year. However, she experienced a pre-quarterfinal exit at the Paris Olympics.“Sometimes I was really close yet so far away. I had good matches in the past, but they didn't turn into wins. I came back, fought harder, and it was important for me to get this win. Yes, I am relieved. I mean, it's the end of the year, and finishing off with a win makes me really grateful.”Sindhu reflects on past near misses and expresses gratitude for her recent win. Lakshya Sen , the 2021 World Championships bronze medalist, won the men's singles final against Singapore's Jia Heng Jason Teh.“I am really happy with the way I had prepared and how I played the match. I hope to do well in the tournaments next year. I have some time now till the new season, which will allow me to train and focus on the upcoming events.”Sen expresses satisfaction with his preparation and performance. He looks forward to the next season and plans to utilize the time for training. The Indian women's doubles pair of Treesa Jolly and Gayatri Gopichand won their first Super 300 title. They defeated China's Bao Li Jing and Li Qian.“We really wanted to win, we were aggressive and kept moving well. There was a strategy, and we implemented it well today. We plan to go with the flow and see what the future holds. We don't want to make too many plans.”Gayatri and Treesa highlight their aggressive strategy and successful implementation. They prefer to remain adaptable for future tournaments. This victory boosts their confidence ahead of the BWF World Tour Finals in China, where they are the sole Indian representatives.“This is our first gold, and it's a great boost for both of us. It has given us a lot of confidence, and we are looking forward to the World Tour Finals now.”The pair view their win as a significant confidence booster for the upcoming World Tour Finals. They are the first Indian women's doubles team to win the Syed Modi International title. They were runners-up in 2022.“The first game was close, but we listened to our coaches, corrected ourselves, and executed the plans. At this level, there is always pressure, and we managed it well.”Treesa and Gayatri credit their coaches for helping them adjust their strategy during the match. They acknowledge the pressure at this level of competition and their ability to handle it effectively.","P.V. Sindhu confirmed her plans to continue playing badminton for the next few years.

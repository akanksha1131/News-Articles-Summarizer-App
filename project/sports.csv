Wayne Gretzky’s fortune and assets are shaping Paulina’s multi-million dollar legacy

The Steinway powerboat is more than just a toy—it’s a Gretzky family heirloom in the making





As Dustin Johnson pursues another shot at U.S. Open glory, attention has shifted to his wife, Paulina Gretzky—not just for her support, but because of what she stands to inherit from her legendary father, the Great One, Wayne Gretzky. While Johnson has secured massive paydays from both the PGA Tour and LIV Golf, Paulina’s future is lined with generational wealth thanks to her father's illustrious career and lavish lifestyle.Wayne Gretzky, often referred to as “The Great One,” is more than just a hockey legend—he’s a financial powerhouse. With an estimated net worth of $250 million, Gretzky holds 61 NHL records and has turned his post-retirement years into a business empire. For Paulina, this means inheriting not only an enormous fortune but also a portfolio of jaw-dropping properties and luxury items.Among his holdings, Gretzky owns a lakefront estate in Idaho, multiple Florida homes, and a childhood residence in Brantford, Ontario. He even repurchased his famed ‘Gretzky Mansion’ in Thousand Oaks, California, only to flip it for a profit in 2021.But one of the most unique pieces in Wayne Gretzky's collection isn’t a home—it’s a custom, handcrafted 34-foot Steinway 340 HT powerboat.Commissioned in 2021, this bespoke mahogany boat—built by Couer Custom—is worth $900,000 and blends elegance with engineering. It can hit speeds of 50 mph but is designed for leisure. “I was relatively fast when I skated, but these days I drive my car slow,” Wayne Gretzky told Robb Report. “I'll take comfort over speed any day.”The boat features plush loungers, a main cockpit with cozy sofas, a stern sunpad, and even an electric bimini for added shade. Paulina’s mother, Janet Jones, played a pivotal role in designing its stylish aesthetic. “She’s the creative one in the family; the only thing I asked for was to have a Canadian flag at the back,” Gretzky added.Also Read: Wayne Gretzky sparks controversy by accusing Florida Panthers of buying success with tax loopholes Between her father’s sprawling real estate, massive fortune, and luxurious custom yacht, Paulina Gretzky’s future looks every bit as glamorous as her past—and Dustin Johnson may not be the biggest star in the household for much longer.","Paulina Gretzky stands to inherit millions from her father, hockey legend Wayne Gretzki.

'Cricketers Aren’t Cattle... ': Harish Thawani on the IPL and Business of Indian Cricket





The Indian cricket team will conduct their final preparations for the upcoming five-match Test series against England through an intra-squad warm-up game against India A, starting June 13, 2025. The four-day practice match, which will be played behind closed doors at the request of head coach Gautam Gambhir, will not be available for live streaming as the team aims to keep their tactical plans private from the opposition.The warm-up fixture will feature 360 overs of match simulation, providing crucial preparation time for both bowlers and batsmen. This approach mirrors the team's preparation strategy implemented before the Border Gavaskar Trophy 2024-25 in Australia.The practice match holds particular significance as it offers Indian players an opportunity to transition from T20 cricket in the Indian Premier League (IPL) to the longer format. The extended session will help players adapt to English conditions before the series opener at Headingley.Jasprit Bumrah's return to Test cricket after a six-month hiatus will be closely monitored during the warm-up game. The pace spearhead, who had to leave the fifth Test in Australia due to injury, has only participated in IPL matches since recovering from a back stress fracture.The team management plans to assess Bumrah's fitness and form by having him bowl multiple spells during the practice match. This evaluation will be crucial in determining his readiness for the demanding Test series.The warm-up game will also help resolve selection dilemmas facing the team. A key decision revolves around choosing a seam bowling partner for Bumrah and Mohammed Siraj, with Akash Deep and Prasidh Krishna being the contenders.Quiz: Who's that IPL player? Another strategic choice awaits the team management regarding the spin department. The selection between Ravindra Jadeja and Kuldeep Yadav as the primary spinner presents different tactical advantages. Jadeja offers additional batting depth along with his spinning abilities, while Kuldeep could serve as an attacking option against England's aggressive batting approach.The practice match marks a significant milestone as it represents Shubman Gill 's first assignment as the official captain of the Indian Test team. The closed-door session will allow the new captain to work with his team without external pressure.The decision to conduct the warm-up match away from public view reflects the team's focus on preparation rather than publicity. This approach allows players to concentrate on acclimatization and strategy development without revealing their tactical plans to their upcoming opponents.The Test series against England, scheduled to begin on June 20, will be the first major challenge for the Indian team under Gill's leadership. The warm-up match serves as the final opportunity for the team to address various tactical and selection questions before the series commences.The comprehensive nature of the practice match, with its extensive over allocation, demonstrates the team's commitment to thorough preparation. This format ensures that all squad members get adequate time to adjust to the demands of Test cricket and English conditions.The practice match represents a crucial phase in India's preparation strategy, combining the need for match practice with tactical discretion.

“Goat was on to something”: Kevin Durant’s bold reaction to resurfaced Michael Jordan clip

Resurfaced video reveals Michael Jordan’s true pick for the best player



Michael Jordan chooses between LeBron & Kobe





Kevin Durant rarely misses when it comes to basketball—and apparently, not when it comes to legacy debates either. The Phoenix Suns superstar recently came across a resurfaced Michael Jordan clip that’s catching fire again on social media. In the video, Jordan jokingly mentions Durant while weighing in on the infamous Kobe Bryant vs. LeBron James question. Now, more than a decade later, Durant’s sharp but playful response has reignited the conversation, with fans and media alike taking notice.It all started when a throwback clip from 2013 began circulating across social platforms this week. In it, NBA legend Michael Jordan is asked one of basketball’s most heated questions: Kobe or LeBron? Sitting down with analyst Ahmad Rashad for the “Michael Jordan at 50” special, Jordan seemed momentarily caught off guard before throwing out an unexpected name: “Kevin Durant.”Though Jordan immediately laughed and clarified that he was joking—“Naw, I’m just kidding,” he said—the clip has lived on in NBA lore as a light-hearted but fascinating moment. And this week, it got new life when Durant himself saw the post and added fuel to the fire.“Goat was on to something,” Durant wrote in the comments section, flipping the joke into a subtle flex that left fans buzzing. Kevin Durant , who turns 37 this year and will enter his 18th NBA season, is widely recognized as one of the most skilled scorers in league history.The two-time NBA champion and two-time Finals MVP has averaged 27.2 points per game across his career while maintaining an elite shooting clip of over 50%. With that kind of resume, even a joke from Jordan feels like a nod worth keeping in the vault.The moment drew even more attention thanks to another clip included in the video—this one featuring a resurfaced quote from Kobe Bryant that added weight to the conversation. “Kevin Durant. That was the one I retired without being able to figure out how I can stop him,” Bryant once admitted. That rare praise from one all-time great to another only added gravity to Durant’s reaction.The viral interview dates back to early 2013, when Michael Jordan was reflecting on his legacy ahead of his 50th birthday. The special, titled “Michael Jordan at 50,” gave the six-time NBA champion a chance to weigh in on the league’s future—and the players most often compared to him.When asked “Kobe or LeBron?” by Rashad, Jordan initially responded with a smirk and said “Kevin Durant” before laughing it off. Then, he gave a more measured answer.“In terms of dominance of the game of basketball, at this stage it’s LeBron,” Jordan acknowledged at the time, crediting James for his physical impact on the game during his Miami Heat prime.But Jordan wasn’t done. He added a clear preference for Bryant’s mentality and hunger.“Championship-wise, it’s Kobe Bryant . He wants it so bad and he’s willing to go to the extreme,” Jordan said. “Guarding a point guard at the age of 34, playing 38 minutes, 40 minutes, that’s ludicrous.”Jordan even suggested that Bryant shared his obsessive drive for greatness: “He’s cursed as much as I am.”When it came to championships—a standard Jordan always held in the highest regard—he summed it up plainly: “Five (rings) beats one.”More than a decade later, the Kobe vs. LeBron debate remains heated—but the narrative has evolved. LeBron James , who joined the Lakers in 2018, now holds four championship rings and recently became the NBA’s all-time leading scorer, the first player ever to surpass 50,000 career points. His longevity and all-around excellence have kept him in the GOAT conversation.Bryant, who tragically passed away in 2020, remains a symbol of competitive spirit. He finished his career with five rings and a 5–2 record in the Finals, while Jordan, famously, went 6–0.Also Read: LeBron James or Kobe Bryant? Dwight Howard’s shocking pick in the legendary NBA debate between his two former teammates What began as a quick-witted joke from Jordan in a 2013 interview has taken on new life in 2025, especially now that Durant has joined the chat. With Kobe openly praising Durant’s unguardable game, and Jordan once (even jokingly) tossing his name into the GOAT conversation, Durant’s legacy is secure.","Kevin Durant responded to a resurfaced Michael Jordan clip from 2013.

The Trade Mechanics: Jonathan Kuminga for Collins





Theare reportedly considering a bold sign-and-trade deal to acquire ex- Atlanta Hawks forward John Collins, potentially sending young star Jonathan Kuminga the other way. This move aims to address the Warriors’ glaring need for consistent scoring beyond Stephen Curry. Golden State Warriors ’ lack of reliable scorers outside Curry was exposed in their 2025 Western Conference Semi-Finals loss to the Minnesota Timberwolves. While Kuminga showed flashes of brilliance, his restricted free agency status makes him a prime trade asset for a team seeking an immediate upgrade.The Jazz, meanwhile, are open to trading Collins after he opts into his $26.5 million expiring contract. As reported by Evan Sidery: ""The Jazz plan to explore trade scenarios for John Collins once he opts into his $26.5 million expiring contract. Collins averaged 18.9 points and 8.2 rebounds on a 62.8 TS% with Utah this season.""John Collins brings a mix of athleticism, floor spacing, and efficiency that could elevate the Golden State Warriors’ offense. Here’s how his 2024-25 stats stack up:His ability to stretch the floor and finish plays aligns perfectly with Golden State’s drive-and-kick system. Pairing Collins with Stephen Curry could create mismatches and open up the offense even further.Here’s why this deal makes sense for both sides:- Warriors Get: A proven scorer who fits their system, adding much-needed firepower.- Jazz Get: A young, high-upside player in Kuminga to build around for the future.Collins’ expiring $26.5 million contract could be matched via a sign-and-trade involving Kuminga, who is due for a new deal. Utah nearly traded Collins in February, and Golden State might finally pull the trigger.What This Means for the Golden State Warriors’ FutureAdding Collins could rejuvenate Golden State’s title hopes. His efficiency and versatility would take pressure off Curry, while Kuminga’s departure would be a calculated risk for a team in win-now mode.Also read: NBA Trade Rumors: Los Angeles Lakers predicted to sign $238 million Utah Jazz to for Big 3 with LeBron James and Luka Doncic and bolster title odds If this trade materializes, the Warriors could re-emerge as a serious contender in the loaded Western Conference.","The Golden State Warriors are reportedly considering a bold sign-and-trade deal to acquire ex-Atlanta Hawks forward John Collins.

is managing lower leg discomfort but has no doubts about suiting up for Game 3 of the NBA Finals against the Oklahoma City Thunder. Despite visible limping after Sunday’s 123-107 loss, Haliburton remains confident he’ll be ready when the series resumes Wednesday night.The Indiana Pacers and Thunder are tied 1-1, with Game 3 tipping off at 8:30 p.m. ET in Indianapolis. Tyrese Haliburton, averaging 15.5 points and six assists in the series, acknowledged the injury but downplayed its severity.“It’s really just a lower leg thing, I’m gonna leave it at that,” Tyrese Haliburton said Tuesday. “I don’t think there’s anything more to elaborate.”Though he didn’t specify whether the issue was related to his calf or ankle, Haliburton’s history of hamstring problems—including a strain that sidelined him during last year’s Eastern Conference finals—raises questions about his durability. Still, neither he nor the Indiana Pacers appear overly concerned.Head coach Rick Carlisle confirmed Haliburton participated fully in Tuesday’s practice and expects him to play. “At this time of year, I don’t know if anybody’s feeling perfect,” Carlisle said. “He has some discomfort, but each day is getting better. This is the time of year where it just doesn’t get any better than this.”Beyond health, Tyrese Haliburton’s bigger challenge has been Oklahoma City’s elite defense.The Thunder, the NBA’s top-rated defensive team this season, have thrown multiple defenders at him, including Luguentz Dort, Cason Wallace, Alex Caruso, and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander.The strategy has worked so far. Haliburton has struggled with efficiency, shooting just 33% from three and averaging four turnovers per game. His assist-to-turnover ratio, usually stellar at nearly 9:1, has dipped significantly.“I feel like I haven’t been great by any means through the first two games,” Haliburton admitted. “I’m just trying to take what I can to prepare for Game 3. The answers always lie in the film.”Indiana’s turnover issues have been a major storyline. The team has coughed up the ball 40 times in two games, with many mistakes leading directly to Thunder points. Carlisle joked about some of the miscues, saying, “Some of our turnovers have been so violently bad, the opponent hasn’t even had a chance to catch the ball.”But the problem is no laughing matter. Against a disciplined team like Oklahoma City, wasted possessions are costly. “You can’t play too careful against them, or otherwise you’ll never get a basket,” Carlisle added.Carlisle also mentioned that a couple of other players are “slightly under the weather,” though he didn’t name them. Forward Aaron Nesmith (ankle) and center Tony Bradley (hip) have dealt with injuries earlier in the playoffs, but their status for Game 3 remains unclear.With the series shifting to Indianapolis, Tyrese Haliburton and the Indiana Pacers have a chance to regain control. His ability to shake off the leg discomfort and solve Oklahoma City’s defensive schemes will be key to Indiana’s title hopes.Also read: Skip Bayless’ Drops Bombshell After OKC Thunder Game 2 Domination – Can the Indiana Pacers Respond?

49ers’ Trent Williams believes Brock Purdy is just getting started



Trent Williams is all in on Brock Purdy being the 49ers franchise QB





When Trent Williams, the San Francisco 49ers’ legendary left tackle, took the podium earlier this week, his usual charisma lit up the room — but it was the mention of Brock Purdy’s new contract that brought out a different kind of joy. With a grin stretching ear to ear, Williams spoke with genuine pride about the quarterback’s journey from an overlooked draft pick to one of the NFL’s highest-paid players.“For me, it’s just super, super fulfilling just to watch a guy like Brock,” Trent Williams shared. “You talk about a Cinderella story, I think this is the epitome of that. A guy going from making a few hundred thousand a year to making 50 million a year, it’s astronomical, and it couldn’t have happened to a better guy.”Purdy’s meteoric rise began in 2022 when he was selected with the final pick of the draft — No. 262 overall. Thrust into action in Week 13 after Jimmy Garoppolo's injury, the unassuming rookie guided the 49ers to a commanding 33-17 win over the Miami Dolphins. The following week, he was named the starter — and never looked back.Since then, Purdy has carried San Francisco to back-to-back NFC Championship Games and a Super Bowl appearance.Despite a rocky 2024 season, where the team stumbled to a 6-11 record and missed the playoffs, confidence in Purdy hasn’t wavered inside the 49ers’ locker room. Both head coach Kyle Shanahan and GM John Lynch have stood firmly behind him — and Williams is no different.“He is the guy for this team,” Williams declared. “He is the guy for this franchise. This is just the tip of the iceberg. He is going to get another contract, he’s going to win a lot of football games. He’s that good of a player. Super, super happy to see that for him. I love him like a brother, so I couldn’t be any happier.”This offseason, Purdy signed a five-year, $265 million extension, securing his place with the 49ers through the 2030 season. Although initial negotiations were rocky — with Purdy reportedly seeking $65 million per year — the final agreement landed at $53 million annually, including $182.55 million in guarantees. It's a significant bet on a quarterback who still has plenty to prove, especially after a step back statistically in 2024 (3,864 yards, 20 TDs, 12 INTs).Purdy now faces the challenge of leading a restructured team, with several key departures in free agency.

Theare reportedly exploring a bold move to acquire Utah Jazz forwardthis offseason. After trading Luka Doncic in February, Dallas appears keen on adding another international star to bolster their roster.Lauri Markkanen, a $46 million All-Star, has been a consistent trade rumor candidate during his time with the Utah Jazz . Despite Utah’s reluctance to move him in previous seasons, another underwhelming campaign might push them to reconsider.As Ivan White of the Sporting News notes in the original report: ""Utah has been unwilling to involve him in serious trade talks over the past couple of years, but another season of uncompetitive basketball might have been enough to change its mind.""Dallas has multiple pathways to acquire the Finnish forward:- Mavericks Receive: Lauri Markkanen- Jazz Receive: P.J. Washington, Daniel Gafford, Caleb Martin, Jaden HardyWhile Lauri Markkanen’s value is high, his hefty salary complicates trade negotiations. This deal would allow Dallas to form a dynamic frontcourt featuring Markkanen, Cooper Flagg, and Anthony Davis.According to Ivan, If Dallas is concerned about Irving’s torn ACL recovery, they could explore a sign-and-trade:- Mavericks Receive: Lauri Markkanen- Jazz Receive: Kyrie Irving (via opt-in) + filler (e.g., Brandon Williams)This scenario would free up the Dallas Mavericks to pursue another point guard while giving Utah a veteran presence to mentor young guards Isaiah Collier and Keyonte George.The Dallas Mavericks are clearly looking to retool after the Doncic trade, and Lauri Markkanen could be the perfect addition. Whether through a multi-player package or an Irving-centered deal, Dallas has options.For Utah, the decision hinges on whether they prioritize future assets or short-term mentorship.

Buffalo Bills share 17 seconds of Josh Allen from Bills 2025 Media Day

Also Read:





Peek-a-boo! Sneak-peek! Into the Buffalo Bills’ handsome-handsome star quarterback Josh Allen’s insane aura! Is there a better-looking quarterback than him? No, right! Especially the glow that comes after a wedding? Mr. Steinfeld now. The official X account of the Buffalo Bills shared a few ravishing snapshots of their leading man, and fans have been gushing over him ever since! But wait, with that handsome face? All their focus went to the new, new wedding ring! And let’s zoom & enhance on that finger - wrote a fan and shared a closeup view of the wedding ring. For some, it’s silver. For many, it’s gold. But for Josh Allen? It’s a black wedding band! Why so? Let’s dig in to find out.Now, there could be many reasons for choosing a black wedding ring. The 2024 NFL season MVP probably chose a black wedding ring to signify strength, commitment, power, resilience, elegance, authority, mystery, maturity, wisdom, depth, transformation, and sophistication.Above all these heavy words, Josh Allen probably just wanted to have something that would be durable and require less maintenance than the high-on-maintenance gold and silver jewelry.If that sounds cheap, then maybe Allen just wanted to be different! Away from the crowd who fall for silver and gold wedding rings and adapt to the everyday norm of marriage. Oh, married? That silver/gold ring on the hand gave it away!If this too, sounds cliche, then the last guess would be - a black wedding ring goes with any and every attire! Allen might not have to think of the whole attire before wearing that wedding ring - if it were a gold or silver one, he’d have to match it with gold or silver attire or something subtly relating to them.But with a black wedding band? Right from casual to classy, from jersey to formal, from swimwear to pajamas - a black wedding ring goes with any and every apparel!The video is 17 seconds long. I see what you did there - noticed a fan! “17” is the jersey number of the 3-time Pro Bowler. But fans also observed that Josh Allen had the shortest honeymoon ever. The 29-year-old quarterback married the 28-year-old Sinners actress Hailee Steinfeld on May 31. And on June 10? He was back to work. “Short hunny moon” - wrote a fan. But other fans? They loved the fact that their NFL MVP was back to the gridiron. One wrote, “Newly wed Allen reporting for duty,” while another said, “We are so gonna win the Superbowl.” A third fan cheered on saying, “You're back to the regular logo. Thank you. Also, 17 is going to annihilate this year.”","NFL MVP Josh Allen opts for a black wedding ring over a silver or gold wedding ring - to signify power, strength, commitment, elegance, and resilience.

Kyrie Irving defends Karl-Anthony Towns amid staggering criticism







Although on-court rivals, Dallas Mavericks’ Kyrie Irving and New York Knicks standout Karl-Anthony Towns have been friends. Recently, Irving gave a shout-out to his brotherly pal Towns while slamming fans for the unending criticism directed at the Knicks superstar. The Knicks lost their championship dream following elimination by the Indiana Pacers in the Eastern Conference Finals, and after that, KAT was under immense criticism for his gameplay during the Eastern Conference Finals.Dallas Mavericks point guard/ shooting guard Kyrie Irving has had enough as he came out in defense of his friend Karl-Anthony Towns amid swirling criticism. “Y’all gotta stop making fun of my brother KA. I’m done with y’all. It’s so unfair,” Irving recently said.“So f***ing wrap, I’m letting y’all know, if you repost that shit again, meme him up, I’m attacking. Not like that physically, GTA, but Imma attack, alright?” the Mavs standout warned.“Y’all gotta leave KAT alone, okay? Cuz y’all don’t know what is like to grow up in Jersey and have all of these cultures that you are a part of, trust me on that. Jersey is literally, 130 miles long, it is very very small state.But when I get back to my point, I’m just sayin’, leave him alone, alright? Because he’s Dominican, he’s black, he grew up in certain area in Jersey, just like me, and you gotta survive out here. You have many different demographics of people, so, you gotta survive out here,” he added.Irving continued, “I don’t agree all the time when he be changing up his tone sometime, I don’t always agree on all of those s*it, you know what I mean, that’s should be funny. But on a serious note, he is my brother and I will protect him all the time.”Karl-Anthony Towns has taken serious heat after the Knicks’ playoff run ended in five games against the Pacers. While he did struggle on defense, especially in key moments, Towns still showed up when it mattered with strong rebounding and clutch offense late in games. That hasn’t stopped fans and media from making him the top target for blame in New York.Tensions grew after The Athletic reported that some Knicks teammates had frustrations with Towns throughout the season. Despite playing a big role in getting New York to the Eastern Conference Finals, the criticism has only fueled talk of a possible trade.Also Read: Vanessa Bryant stuns courtside in fiery red ensemble during NYC WNBA outing with daughters As for the Mavericks, the team took a major hit when All-Star guard Kyrie Irving tore his ACL in March.

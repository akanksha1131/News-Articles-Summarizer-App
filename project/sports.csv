Bombay Sport Exchange Ep.1: JioStar's Sanjog Gupta on IPL, Indian market and India-Australia series

How international players are playing cricket leagues in the US on a TOURIST VISA | BTB Highlights

The World Cricketers' Association (WCA) released its report titled 'Protecting History, Embracing Change: A Unified, Coherent Global Future' on Wednesday (March 26) wherein it identified major problems plaguing the sport while proposing solutions for them. The highlight of the 30-page document is how the current revenue sharing model of the International Cricket Council (ICC) is ""skewed"" and laid emphasis on Board of Control for Cricket in India ( BCCI ) taking a lion's share (38.5%). The report further added that the global cricket finances are ""not optimised.""In the trumpet call, the report has failed to address why the BCCI takes the large chunk of the revenue or even deliberate on it. The report also doesn't talk about the contributions of the Indian cricket board to the global cricket body's revenue pool. There is not a single reference to how the media rights sale for the Indian market in the ongoing cycle has given the ICC an inflow of funds which was never seen before and how the advertisers are queuing up for an India game.""50% of all ICC revenue is distributed to the largest three countries (38.5% to BCCI),"" reads a part of the report.Industry experts have expressed their surprise at the observations and suggestions of the Paul Marsh-led committee and insisted that a blind eye can't be turned towards how India is contributing in overall development of the sport.""You are saying that for getting 85-90% of ICC's overall numbers, the BCCI is taking way too much at 38.5%? There was a reason why ICC sold its media rights for the ongoing cycle in different bundles and it was to capitalise on the Indian market. The windfall was for everyone to see and just a quick evaluation of what the sale of other territories brought to the table is enough to re-emphasise the importance of India,"" say those in the know of numbers.In addition to the revenue sharing model, the report also touches upon the franchise-based T20 leagues and noted that, ""the IPL accounts for almost half the global cricket economy but shares only circa 0.3% of revenue with other countries and less than 10% with players.""In the recommendations, the panel has also proposed ""the release of India men’s players to play in global T20 leagues outside of the IPL, growing interest in and the earning potential of these leagues.""By plainly stating the basics, the report has again ignored how the Indian cricket board is investing heavily in its infrastructure, taking care of former and current players and hosting more than 2,000 domestic games in a season. A one-time benefit was carved out for a lot of former India cricketers and they continue to draw a monthly pension from the BCCI. In case of an untimely demise of a cricketer, his/her family gets the amount.""Who is paying for all these expenses? There has been a constant drive to put players ahead and the recent Test incentive scheme, which was ruled out last year, is a testament of that. There is non-stop cricket happening in the country and it needs a steady flow of funds to ensure all parts of the machine remain well-oiled. Not only the current cricketers, even the former are well taken care of with pension and other benefits,"" the experts tracking the space further add.The WCA report has made numerous suggestions for the issues plaguing global cricket and urged, ""in line with international precedents, a minimum 2% and maximum 10% for the top 24 countries, and a minimum 10% distribution collectively for countries 25+ Centralised ‘Global Growth & Development Fund,’ to fund Core International Cricket and other initiatives"".It is understood that the report has already been shared with the men's cricket committee of the ICC and will be soon shared with the women's cricket committee too.","The World Cricketers' Association (WCA) released its report titled 'Protecting History, Embracing Change: A Unified, Coherent Global Future' The highlight of the 30-page document is how the current revenue sharing model of the International Cricket Council (ICC) is ""skewed"" and laid emphasis on Board of Control for Cricket in India ( BCCI ) taking a lion's share (38.5%).","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-119536760,imgsize-18806,width-400,resizemode-4/119536760.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Kolkata Knight Riders had a disappointing start to their IPL 2025 campaign against Royal Challengers Bengaluru on March 22 at Eden Gardens, but they bounced back in style on Wednesday. The defending champions put up a commanding performance to register their first win of the season, securing two valuable points in the standings. The star of the night was Quinton de Kock , whose stellar knock powered KKR to an emphatic eight-wicket victory over Rajasthan Royals . This win also marked KKR’s first triumph under Ajinkya Rahane ’s captaincy.De Kock’s brilliance ensured that KKR remained in control throughout the chase. His combination of clean ball-striking and sharp game awareness reaffirmed why he is regarded as one of the most dangerous openers in the IPL. His innings was a textbook display of counter-attacking cricket—starting with caution before seamlessly shifting gears to dismantle the opposition’s bowling attack with exquisite timing and brute power.With this dominant win, KKR not only got off the mark in IPL 2025 but also sent a strong statement to their rivals. Under Rahane’s leadership, the team has gained momentum, with de Kock leading the charge in spectacular fashion.Earlier in the match, Rahane won the toss and opted to field first, putting Rajasthan Royals on the back foot. Led by Riyan Parag, RR struggled to put up a competitive total as KKR’s disciplined bowling unit applied relentless pressure. Yashasvi Jaiswal (29 off 24) and Dhruv Jurel (33 off 28) were the only notable contributors as the Royals managed to post 151/9 in their 20 overs.KKR’s bowlers were clinical, with Varun Chakaravarthy (2/17) and Moeen Ali (2/23) stifling RR’s middle order, while Harshit Rana and Vaibhav Arora chipped in with crucial wickets to keep the total within reach.Chasing 152, KKR faced an early setback when opener Moeen Ali was run out for just 5. However, de Kock stepped up with an authoritative display, dismantling the RR bowling attack with a breathtaking array of strokes. Despite losing captain Rahane for 18, the South African wicketkeeper-batsman kept the chase on track with a flurry of boundaries and well-calculated big hits.De Kock’s explosive innings featured eight fours and six towering sixes, making light work of the Rajasthan bowling attack. His heroics ensured KKR cruised to victory with plenty of overs to spare.Next up, KKR will take on five-time champions Mumbai Indians at the Wankhede Stadium on Monday, looking to build on their newfound momentum.",Kolkata Knight Riders beat Rajasthan Royals by eight wickets in IPL 2025.

Ashutosh Sharma , despite playing with a cut on his finger, delivered a match-winning performance for Delhi Capitals in their fourth IPL 2025 match against Lucknow Super Giants , scoring a crucial 66*. His grit and determination earned praise from the team coach, who highlighted his ""desire to play"" and his impactful knock.""I want to mention about this... he had a cut on his finger, and there was a chance he could have missed out on the game. I had a chat with him two days prior to the game when he had that cut. I asked how are you feeling, will you play, and he said quite clearly, 'I am playing the game. I want to be in the middle.' There's one thing to speak of being in the middle and the desire to play. But to go in there to bat the way you batted—15 off 15 at one stage to 61 off 31, finishing off the game in style. Congratulations,"" Delhi Capitals coach Hemang Badani said in a video shared by Delhi Capitals on social media.Ashutosh played a crucial role in one of the most dramatic IPL chases in recent history, steering DC to a successful pursuit of 210 after they were struggling at 65/5.His final partnership with Mohit proved decisive in securing a memorable win at Vizag.His unbeaten 66 off 31 balls, featuring five fours and six sixes, is the second-highest score by a batter at number seven or below during a successful IPL chase.He equaled Kolkata Knight Riders' (KKR) Andre Russell, who hit 66* in a 2015 chase against Punjab.The record remains with Dwayne Bravo, who smashed 68 off 30 balls to guide Chennai Super Kings to a thrilling one-wicket win over Mumbai Indians.Delhi Capitals will next face Sunrisers Hyderabad at the Dr. Y.S.

BENGALURU: Asian champion Man Singh will not be able to defend his title in the 20th Asian Marathon Championships to be held in Jiaxing, China, on March 30. The Athletics Federation of India (AFI) officials allegedly failed to submit the names of Indian athletes before the entry deadline.The alleged goof-up could cost the Army athlete a berth in the World Championships to be held in Tokyo later this year as he will lose out on valuable ranking points.“It’s a big disappointment for Man Singh as he was training hard to climb the podium in China and also to advance in the world rankings in Road To Tokyo list,” sources in athletics circles told TOI. “The athletes were earlier sounded out but two weeks back they were told that none of the athletes are going,” they added.According to sources, once AFI realised that they had missed the date, the newly elected office-bearers tried hard to get an entry at least for Man Singh but nothing worked as the deadline had passed on February 28. AFI now plans to send Man Singh to next month’s Hamburg Marathon, but it would be an uphill task for Singh to make the cut for Tokyo.AFI officials said the athletes were not entered for the Asian meet as they were not ready.“We were told our athletes are not ready. That’s why we dropped out. It’s wrong to say that we missed the deadline,” an official told TOI.This will be the second no-show by Indian athletes, after none of the qualified athletes were entered for the recent World Indoor Athletics.","Asian champion Man Singh will not be able to defend his title in the 20th Asian Marathon Championships to be held in Jiaxing, China, on March 30.

NEW DELHI: Quinton de Kock delivered a masterclass in controlled aggression, smashing an unbeaten 97 off 61 balls to steer Kolkata Knight Riders to a commanding eight-wicket victory over Rajasthan Royals in their IPL 2025 clash on Wednesday. On a challenging Barsapara surface, KKR’s disciplined bowling unit, led by spinners Varun Chakravarthy (2/17) and Moeen Ali (2/23), restricted RR to a modest 151/9.Despite the tricky conditions, De Kock paced the chase beautifully, his innings decorated with eight fours and six sixes. KKR reached the target comfortably in 17.3 overs, securing their first win of the season in style.KKR’s chase remained in control, with the required run rate staying manageable throughout. Though they lost Moeen Ali (5) and captain Ajinkya Rahane (18) early, De Kock anchored the innings masterfully. He found solid support in young Angkrish Raghuvanshi, who contributed 22 off 17 balls. The duo’s unbeaten 83-run partnership off just 44 deliveries sealed the victory for the defending champions.The South African keeper-batter played a near-flawless innings, relying on precision and placement rather than reckless power-hitting. He took calculated risks when needed, dismantling RR’s bowling attack with ease. His 35-ball half-century was highlighted by a towering six over wide long-on off Wanindu Hasaranga—his third maximum of the innings.RR’s strategy of over-relying on spin played into KKR’s hands, allowing their batters to settle in. Hasaranga, who had previously dismissed De Kock twice in the IPL, found himself on the receiving end this time. A more aggressive strategy—introducing Jofra Archer earlier—could have added pressure, but the English speedster was held back until the 18th over, by which time KKR needed only 17 runs from 18 balls.De Kock quickly wrapped up the chase, taking Archer apart with a boundary and two massive sixes, sealing KKR’s emphatic win.Earlier, KKR’s bowlers turned the game in their favor with timely strikes. Chakravarthy and Moeen Ali broke the Royals’ middle order with two wickets each in consecutive overs after the powerplay, shifting the momentum decisively. Seamer Vaibhav Arora (2/33) proved expensive but made crucial breakthroughs, dismissing RR skipper Sanju Samson (13 off 11) and impact substitute Shubham Dubey (9).Harshit Rana (2/36) delivered at the death, removing Dhruv Jurel (33 off 28) and the dangerous Shimron Hetmyer (7) in a crucial penultimate over. A late cameo from Jofra Archer (16 off 7) helped RR scrape past 150, but Spencer Johnson (1/42) dismissed him on the penultimate ball of their innings.RR initially looked set for a big total at 54/1, with Yashasvi Jaiswal (29 off 24) and local favorite Riyan Parag (25 off 15) leading the charge. Parag, captaining RR for the first time at his home ground, showed early intent, smashing a six off Harshit Rana and playing the shot of the innings—a stunning lofted drive off Vaibhav Arora straight down the ground.Jaiswal, dropped on 19, ended the powerplay with a six as RR reached a promising 54/1 after six overs. However, KKR hit back immediately, with mystery spinner Chakravarthy triggering a collapse by dismissing the well-set Parag with a deceptive 113kph delivery in the seventh over.With this victory, KKR not only opened their account in IPL 2025 but also sent a strong message to their competitors. They will now shift focus to their next challenge against five-time champions Mumbai Indians at the Wankhede Stadium.",Kolkata Knight Riders beat Rajasthan Royals by eight wickets in their IPL 2025 clash.

SRH vs LSG Squads:

Sunrisers Hyderabad:

Lucknow Super Giants:

NEW DELHI: Lucknow Super Giants (LSG), smarting from a narrow opening defeat, face a daunting task against the explosive Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) in their upcoming IPL clash on Thursday at Rajiv Gandhi International Cricket Stadium, Hyderabad.SRH, last year's runners-up, began their campaign with a statement victory, dismantling the Rajasthan Royals by 44 runs and setting the tournament's early pace.SRH's batting acumen was on full display, amassing a near-record 286 runs.

The silver lining, however, came from the performances of Deepak Chahar and debutant Vignesh Puthur, whose three-wicket haul showcased immense promise.Mumbai Indians missed the presence of regular skipper Hardik Pandya in the opening game, as he was serving a one-match suspension due to a slow-over rate penalty from IPL 2024.However, the dynamic all-rounder is expected to be back in action against Gujarat Titans, which will provide a much-needed boost to the team’s balance.One major concern for Mumbai Indians remains the availability of Jasprit Bumrah While MI bowling coach Paras Mhambrey has confirmed that the ace pacer is making steady progress, there is still no official return date.

SHILLONG: The fans came out in large numbers, making their presence felt with some lusty cheering. But India, playing their second international match at the JN Stadium here, could not give them the joy they had hoped for as their opening AFC Asian Cup Qualifier against Bangladesh ended 0-0 on Tuesday.With the other match of Group C between Hong Kong and Singapore also ending in a 0-0 draw, all four in the group are level on one point each with five more games left to decide the toppers and eventual qualifiers for the tournament to be held Saudi Arabia in 2027.The match began on a frustrating note for India as they could have been two goals behind within the opening 20 minutes — due to silly mistakes by goalkeeper Vishal Kaith and Sandesh Jhingan. While Mojibor Jony failed to slot home a terrible clearance from Kaith in the opening minute, Shariyar Emon glanced wide a gorgeous cross from Mohammed Shakil Topu.India managed more possession in the first half but it was Hamza Choudhury’s game reading in midfield that kept Bangladesh in the hunt for a breakthrough. While Mohd Ridoy’s clearance of a Liston Colaco free-kick in the 23rd minute could have ended in an own goal, it was in the 31st minute that the best chance of the half came for India.Colaco sent a cross from the left flank to the right of the goal after combining from behind with Subhasish Bose. But Udanta’s diving header was saved by Bangladesh custodian Mitul Marma, who then went on to collect Farukh’s soft try from the ensuing rebound. The chance lifted India’s game with Colaco looking more dangerous and Sunil Chhetri lurking more often near the goal. However, the constant cheers from the stands could not inspire a breakthrough.India started the second half with more purpose. But with Hamza Choudhury marking Chhetri during set-pieces, the Indian legend failed to win his duels with the former Premier League veteran.Manolo Marquez’s ‘men in blue’ did come close in the 55th and 57th minutes.

NEW DELHI: India and Bangladesh played out a goal-less draw in their 2027 AFC Asian Cup qualifying match on Tuesday. The Bangladesh side showed better form in the initial half, generating more attacks and corner kicks, though without creating definitive scoring opportunities.The second half saw India displaying improved control, applying substantial pressure on Bangladesh, yet struggling to create meaningful chances.A crucial moment occurred in the 12th minute when Indian goalkeeper Vishal Kaith's miscalculated kick deflected off an opponent. Mohammed Ridoy attempted to capitalise with a left-footed shot, but Subhasish Bose made a vital clearance on the goal line.India's notable opportunity arrived in the 31st minute when Udanta Singh's header from Liston Colaco's left-wing cross was saved by Bangladesh keeper Mitul Marma.India's second-half dominance included Bose's ambitious long-range attempt in the 68th minute, which narrowly missed the left corner despite beating the goalkeeper.Five minutes afterwards, Farukh Choudhary's right-footed shot deflected off a Bangladeshi defender and went wide.In the 84th minute, Sunil Chhetri found space for a free header in the box, but his attempt lacked both accuracy and power.Bangladesh's Hamza Choudhury, on loan at Sheffield United from Leicester City, remained largely ineffective throughout the match.The teams will meet again on November 18 in Bangladesh.

Former FIFA president Sepp Blatter and ex-UEFA president Michel Platini have secured their second court victory against Swiss federal prosecutors. Both were acquitted again on charges related to fraud, forgery, mismanagement, and misappropriation of over $2 million in FIFA funds from 2011.Blatter, now 89 years old, showed little reaction as he listened to the verdict from three cantonal judges serving as a federal criminal appeals court. Sitting in front of Platini, he alternated between tapping his fingers and resting his left hand over his mouth.Platini, on the other hand, sat with his arms crossed or rubbing his hands as he listened to a translator beside him conveying the court's decision from German to his native French.The Swiss attorney general’s office had appealed a previous acquittal from July 2022, seeking 20-month sentences, suspended for two years.Both Blatter and Platini have consistently denied any wrongdoing in this decade-long case, which hinged on their claims of a verbal agreement regarding the disputed payment.In February 2011, Blatter approved a payment of 2 million Swiss francs (approximately $2.21 million) to football legend Platini for supplementary and non-contracted salary as a presidential advisor from 1998 to 2002.This latest victory for Blatter and 69-year-old Platini marks exactly 9½ years since the Swiss federal investigation was made public, triggering events that ended the careers of some of football’s most influential figures.On that September day in 2015 in Zurich, police arrived to question them at FIFA after an executive committee meeting, as Platini was a strong favorite to succeed his former mentor in an upcoming election.Despite federal court trials clearing their names twice, Blatter’s legacy will likely remain intertwined with his leadership of FIFA during corruption scandals that implicated many senior football officials worldwide.Platini, one of the sport's greatest players and once Blatter’s protégé in politics, never achieved the FIFA presidency he often believed was his destined role.","Sepp Blatter and Michel Platini have been acquitted by a Swiss court.

Shillong: How much can one footballer influence the fate of a team or the course of its history? Sunil Chhetri made some good points on that with a strike in his comeback for India vs Maldives in the friendly last week as the hosts returned to winning ways after over a year of winless results.And while he and coach Manolo Marquez will look to carry that momentum into the crucial AFC Asian Cup Qualifier against Bangladesh here on Tuesday, their opponents on the day will be eager for the trump card up their sleeve, Hamza Choudhury , to earn their first win against India since 2003.The lead-up to the teams’ opening Group C match at JN Stadium here may have been dominated by the hype surrounding two footballers – one, the third highest active scorer in international football after Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi, and the other, a veteran of 57 Premier League matches for Leicester City.But all 22 players on the pitch will have to play their roles well to churn out three points and take a positive step towards qualification for Saudi Arabia 2027. “I think it’s exciting having Hamza and having Sunil back. It’s going to be really competitive. But it’s not going to be only about them,” Bangladesh coach Javier Cabrera said on Monday. “If we win tomorrow, it will not only be for Hamza.”His fellow Spaniard and Indian counterpart Marquez echoed the same feelings for a Chhetri-inspired India while also acknowledging the importance of starting the qualifiers on a winning note, with matches against Hong Kong and Singapore to follow thereafter. “The first game is obviously very important. It’s a short competition, only the top team qualifies for the tournament. There are six games and we need to finish first. We want to get the maximum points possible to qualify for Saudi Arabia,” he said on match eve on Monday.Already laden with injury woes, the latest being in-form Brandon Fernandes against Maldives, it will be interesting to see if Marquez utilises the pace of the young Macarton Nickson or the experience of Udanta Singh — the new inductees into the squad — to make up for Fernandes’ absence on Tuesday.He will, however, have been impressed by performances of Hmingthanmawia Ralte at right-back and, going forward, goalscorer Liston Colaco down the left, debutant Ayush Dev Chhetri in midfield, and the aerial prowess of Rahul Bheke, and will hope for them to carry the show vs Bangladesh.However, India have drawn two of their last three matches against Bangladesh, all of which came in the Igor Stimac era, and were lucky to get away with a point through Adil Khan’s late equaliser in their last clash. While the hosts will be wary of a motivated Bangladesh having Sheffield United’s Choudhury making his debut for his national team, it wouldn’t be a surprise if Choudhury is pushed further upfield, unlike the deeper midfield role he occupies for his clubs in England, to make a difference with his quality higher up.Also, the partnership that he scripts with skipper and veteran Jamal Bhuyan in the middle could well decide Bangladesh’s fortunes in this match and throughout the qualifying campaign.“We know it’s not only Hamza, they have other good players. (And) the same coach for the last three years with the same philosophy. Continuity is obviously important in any team,” acknowledged the Indian coach, adding, “But I feel that if we play a good game, we will win this one. But obviously, if you ask Javi Cabrera the same, he will say the opposite.”Tuesday will reveal which Spaniard emerges on top in the South Asian derby or if the cycle of draws between them continues.","India take on Bangladesh in their first AFC Asian Cup qualifier on Tuesday.

World number one Aryna Sabalenka fought back in the second set to secure her spot in the semi-finals of the Miami Open , defeating China's Zheng Qinwen 6-2, 7-5 on Tuesday.This win marks Sabalenka’s first appearance in the semi-finals in Miami, where she’ll meet Italy's Jasmine Paolini for a chance to reach the final.It seemed like a straightforward match for the Belarusian against the ninth seed Zheng as she easily took the first set. However, Zheng made adjustments and came out strong in the second set, breaking Sabalenka twice to establish a 4-2 lead.Sabalenka faced significant pressure at 0-40 but, after showing some frustration, rallied to hold serve and tie it at 4-4. She then unleashed a powerful finish, breaking Zheng again to lead 6-5 and serving confidently to clinch the match.""Honestly every match is tough against her, I always have to work really hard to get the win and today was an incredible level from both of us,"" said Sabalenka.""I'm super happy to get this win.

Paolini, aiming for her second WTA 1000 title since winning in Dubai last year, exuded confidence and expressed that she knew her hard work would eventually lead to results.""I think I didn't play bad this season but I just didn't have a great result. But I was there. I lost many matches but to big opponents,"" she said.""It was tough but I was repeating to myself that I was there - maybe I just needed a little more confidence and it came here maybe,"" she said.In Wednesday's quarter-finals, second seed Iga Swiatek will face Alexandra Eala, the teenage wildcard from the Philippines who has already defeated Australian Open champion Madison Keys.Additionally, Britain's Emma Raducanu, who is experiencing her best tournament run since winning the US Open in 2021, will take on American fourth seed Jessica Pegula.","Aryna Sabalenka defeated China's Zheng Qinwen 6-2, 7-5 on Tuesday.

Paolini sinks Osaka

Australia's Alex de Minaur put an end to Brazilian talent Joao Fonseca 's challenge at the Miami Open, outlasting the 18-year-old 5-7, 7-5, 6-3 in an enthralling contest.Attendance on stadium court had been sparse throughout Monday, but the Hard Rock Stadium turned into a mini-Maracana Stadium for Fonseca's match, complete with Brazilian flags and football-style chanting.Fonseca brought his energetic brand of ultra-attacking tennis, but De Minaur was up to the challenge, coping with both the blistering forehands and the partisan crowd.Such was the dominance of Fonseca's raucous support that the referee switched to Portuguese for his appeals for quiet.But de Minaur won six of the final seven games to move into the fourth round, keeping his cool even when the crowd, at times, disrupted his serve preparation.""Mentally I was ready for this match, I knew I was not only going to play an incredible talent like Joao, playing with immense confidence and nothing to lose, but also an incredible crowd that was on his side from the first point until the last,"" de Minaur said.""One of my biggest strengths is my mentality and that is what got me the win today,"" he added.Top seed Alexander Zverev recovered from a slow start to power into the fourth round of the Miami Open with a 7-5, 6-4 win against Australia's Jordan Thompson.The German was 4-1 down in the first set but then went on a roll, winning eight of the next nine games to progress.Zverev lost in the opening round at Indian Wells, but with Carlos Alcaraz already out in Miami he will fancy his chances of adding to his list of seven Masters 1000 titles.Third-seed Taylor Fritz also moved into the fourth round beating Denis Shapovalov of Canada 7-5, 6-3.The American let slip a 5-2 lead in the first set, but regained control with his serve proving too much for Shapovalov.In the women's draw, third-seed Coco Gauff 's bid ended with a 6-4 6-4 loss to Poland's Magda Linette .Top-seeded Aryna Sabalenka eased her way into the last eight with a 6-4, 6-4 win over last year's winner Danielle Collins of the USA.Next, Sabalenka will be up against ninth seeded Olympic gold medallist Zheng Qinwen who reached her second consecutive WTA 1000 quarter-final, with a straight-sets win over Ashlyn Krueger.""I'm super happy to get this win in straight sets and happy with the level I played today,"" said Sabalenka.""She's a tough opponent, and we had a lot of tough and tricky matches in the past. So was very happy to get through this one,"" she added.Italy's Jasmine Paolini enjoyed a 3-6, 6-4, 6-4 comeback win over Naomi Osaka in 2 hours and 15 minutes.Since her comeback from maternity leave 15 months ago, Osaka has been showing some signs of getting back towards her best but Paolini was the first top 10 player Osaka has faced this year.""I don't think that I can say that I've played a lot of matches against top players like this in a while,"" said Osaka.""The way she plays kind of catches me off guard, simply because of her height. I didn't know she could hit like that,"" she added.Emma Raducanu continued her impressive form in Miami, cruising to a 6-1, 6-3 victory in 69 minutes over American Amanda Anisimova, who had eliminated Indian Wells winner Mirra Andreeva on Sunday.It is the first time Raducanu has won four straight WTA Tour main draw matches in a row since her US Open triumph in 2021. She will face American Jessica Pegula next.Raducanu, who has brought in some old faces from the early days of her career for this tournament, said she was benefitting from their presence.""I'm really happy with how things are on and off the court right now and just so happy that's able to transfer on to the match court,"" she said.Alexandra Eala, the 19-year-old from the Philippines who upset Australian Open champion Madison Keys on Sunday, was handed a place in the quarter-finals after her fourth round opponent, Spain's Paula Badosa, pulled out with a lower back injury.In the last eight Eala will face second seed Iga Swiatek who battled past Ukraine's Elina Svitolina 7-6 (7/5) 6-3.","Alex de Minaur beats Joao Fonseca 5-7, 7-5, 6-3 in enthralling contest.

Alexandra Eala , a 19-year-old tennis player from the Philippines, achieved a historic victory at the Miami Open on Sunday by defeating Australian Open champion Madison Keys .This win marked a significant milestone as Eala became the first Filipino woman to defeat a top-10 ranked player since the ranking system's inception 50 years ago.The emotional victory saw Eala celebrating with her team, embracing them while fighting back tears.""It's a big thing to take in, and I feel it's important for me to take it in step by step. I'm so super proud of what I was able to accomplish, but it definitely fuels me more.""""I know and it's in my mind that I have a next match, but I need to stop, and I need to recognise that what I did today was really amazing. I think my reaction on court, you know, sums up pretty much how I feel about it.""At the age of 13, Eala's family made the decision to send her to Rafael Nadal's academy in Mallorca, Spain, recognizing her evident talent.The academy's exceptional coaching and facilities helped shape Eala into the 2022 US Open girls' singles champion and a competitive player on the WTA Tour .""The academy has been my home for the past seven years. Of course, my family should take credit for the foundation that they laid out before they sent me there.""""But of course, the academy was able to build on that foundation in such a way that I'm able to be where I am now. And I think the combination of everything that I've been through since I started tennis is what has led to this moment and what has led to me having all these opportunities.""The decision to move to Europe was made easier as her brother Miko also joined the academy.""It was definitely a big decision for me, for us. As soon as I heard that, I jumped at the opportunity because I knew that I had to get out of the country eventually to improve.""Eala's tennis journey began with her grandfather, a club player who coached her brother and cousins before focusing on her development.""I was kind of the next in line to do that and to spend time with him. It eventually blossomed into the career I have now.""Her victory came shortly after fellow Nadal Academy member Coleman Wong from Hong Kong defeated American 13th seed Ben Shelton in Miami.""I'm super happy for him and to see someone that I've known so long do so well is definitely an inspiration. Not just to me, but I feel in general a lot of people can take inspiration from him.""Despite her success, Eala maintains a humble perspective about being a role model for young players in the Philippines.""The young kids, the youth in the Philippines, they don't need to take inspiration from me. They can take inspiration from anyone they want. You know, they can take inspiration from other things, which is what I did growing up.""","Alexandra Eala became the first Filipino woman to defeat a top-10 ranked player since the ranking system's inception 50 years ago.

You didn't have anyone from where you're from to pave the way. Of course you had many people to look up to around the world, but I think -- I hope this takes Filipino tennis to the next step.""Keys acknowledged her performance was below par, following her recent defeat to Aryna Sabalenka at Indian Wells.""My serve was not really there today and I just kind of felt a little flat -- and when you are playing someone who makes a ton of balls back and absorbs really well, that's not really the keys to success.""Eleventh-seeded Andreeva faced physical challenges during her match against Miami resident Anisimova, requiring medical attention for an abdominal issue early in the first set.The match lasted 2 hours and 49 minutes, with Anisimova winning 7-6 (7/5), 2-6, 6-3.

BENGALURU: Vedant Mohan -- India’s most promising sub-junior tennis player (under-14) – has kickstarted the next step of his junior career, transitioning to the International Tennis Federation’s junior Tour (under-18).The 14-year-old, who had been locked down at his training base in Javea, a coastal town in Spain since February, started by playing a couple of base-level ITFs in Sri Lanka these last weeks. He's scheduled for more J30s and J60s in May, most likely in Africa.Vedant, left-handed, also plays on the Spanish circuit and has gained immensely in the last few years competing in Tennis Europe events alongside some of the best under-14 talents in the world. Vedant’s highest ranking in the under-14 section of the Tennis Europe ratings was achieved on his 14th birthday this January, when he still had another 12 months left in the age-group.He was ranked No.13 and at the time, the only Asian in the top 25.While playing in Europe helped grow Vedant’s game, the 5-feet-8-inch Indian couldn’t play the full circuit. He didn’t qualify for the European Championships, the Summer or Winter Cups, all big-ticket competitions, and open only to Europeans as they are team events.That, along with the fact that he was cash-strapped, contributed to Vedant’s rather limited matchplay in comparison to his peers (2011-born) who were ranked higher than him.For instance, the TE No.1 (U-14) Mario Vukovic of France has played 176 singles matches and the No.2 Greece’s Rafael Pagonis played 192 while Vedant has played just 102.The 14-year-old will now play a mix of U-16 and U-18 tournaments in Spain, while targeting ITF under-18s. Vedant’s parents – father Dhruv and mother Anisha – moved to Spain five years ago when their son, then nine, received a tennis scholarship.Mohan, a commercial pilot, has for most part funded Vedant’s mushrooming career, while also leaning on Anisha’s and his family back home in India. He lives in Muscat, while Anisha and their two sons live in Javea, where Vedant trains under Javier Ferrer, brother of former top-5 pro David.Vedant, who idolises tennis legend Novak Djokovic because of his mentality, says his favourite surface is clay.“I love that I can rip the ball hard and heavy with topspin on clay. Also, I love to slide,” he told TOI. “My favourite shot is my inside-out forehand. I like to play aggressively, my game is all court. I like to volley and also play with variation.”Mohan, a collegiate-level tennis player in India, winning gold medals in singles and doubles, is hoping his son will be part of junior Grand Slam draws in the next 18-to-24 months.“The ultimate goal is the pros, the ATP Tour,” he said, adding, “At this stage we’re only looking to develop his game.”","Vedant Mohan is India’s most promising sub-junior tennis player (under-14) The 14-year-old will now play a mix of U-16 and U-18 tournaments in Spain.

Miami: Carlos Alcaraz , ranked world number three, experienced an unexpected early elimination from the Miami Open on Friday. Belgian veteran David Goffin secured a remarkable comeback victory with a score of 5-7, 6-4, 6-3 at Hard Rock Stadium .Goffin, aged 34 and currently ranked 55th, had previously defeated Alcaraz in Astana three years ago. Noticing Alcaraz's subpar performance in the opening set, Goffin adopted an aggressive approach.Goffin, who once achieved a career-high ranking of No.7 in 2017, delivered impressive winning shots while Alcaraz struggled with unforced errors. The Belgian player managed to secure a break advantage in all three sets, and despite losing his lead in the first set, he maintained composure to secure the victory.""When I came out earlier... just to warm up on the court, I felt 'I'm moving well. I'm feeling quite relaxed. I'm hitting the ball really well' and so I hoped it would be the same during the match.""""I started the match well. I had the break in the first and he started to play really well at the end of the first.""""It's that kind of night that I will remember for sure -- against Carlos and in a stadium like that.

Meanwhile, Novak Djokovic secured a straight-sets victory over Australian Rinky Hijikata.Medvedev, who won the Miami title in 2023, displayed frustration by throwing his racket multiple times. Munar, the 27-year-old from Mallorca, achieved his third career victory over a top 10 opponent.The Russian player committed 32 unforced errors and failed to convert two break points in the final game despite having an opportunity to mount a comeback.""Yeah, I was not 100% physically, but I tried my best to get into the match. Every day was better and better. I had some problems after Indian Wells. Can happen.""""He played well, so that's why (he won) I wouldn't go to the match if I would kind of definitely know I'm not ready to win.""Djokovic, who previously lost to a lucky loser at Indian Wells, defeated 86th-ranked Hijikata 6-0, 7-6 (7/1), ending his three-match losing streak. He has now matched Rafael Nadal's record of 410 match wins in Masters 1000 tournaments since their inception in 1990.Karen Khachanov halted Nick Kyrgios's comeback with a 7-6 (7/3), 6-0 victory. Kyrgios, returning from wrist surgery, had secured his first tour-level win since October 2022 against Mackenzie McDonald but couldn't overcome Khachanov, a semi-finalist in Miami last year.In the women's competition, world number two Iga Swiatek advanced to the third round by defeating France's Caroline Garcia 6-2, 7-5. The match proved more challenging than their recent encounter at Indian Wells.Swiatek faced a 3-1 deficit in the second set and saved a set point while serving at 5-4 down before winning the final three games.""My energy level got down really fast.

Miami:

Australian Nick Kyrgios won his first match since 2022 as he fought back from a set down to beat American Mackenzie McDonald 3-6, 6-3, 6-4 at the Miami Open on Wednesday.Kyrgios's career has been blighted by injuries in the last two years and he had to retire from his first round match at Indian Wells earlier this month.The flamboyant 29-year-old had suffered pain in his surgically reconstructed right wrist - a procedure that left him on the sidelines for 18 months.""It has been a long journey, even to just get to the start line of matches and be scared to just finish them,"" Kyrgios said.""To come off and get a win and feel like I belong again was special,"" added after the one-hour, 43-minute victory.Kyrgios, the 2022 Wimbledon finalist, has been plagued by injuries in his career but it was the wrist which caused him the most serious issues and he said he was deeply pessimistic about his chances of a comeback.""I never thought I would play tennis again to be brutally honest with you. I was having conversations with my camp and my team, and I said 'I don't know how long I can keep doing this for',"" he said.""This (win) puts some petrol in the tank but I need to be realistic and see how my wrist feels tomorrow because it is a grind out here,"" he added.There was a first round win for 38-year-old Frenchman Gael Monfils who became the second oldest man, after Jimmy Connors, to win at the Miami Open.Monfils beat last year's quarter-finalist, Hungary's Fabian Marozsan, 6-3, 3-6, 6-4.In the women's draw, Emma Raducanu claimed her first win, defeating 19-year-old wild card Sayaka Ishii of Japan 6-2, 6-1 in just 65 minutes.The 2021 US Open champion will face eighth-seeded American Emma Navarro in the second round, her first meeting with a top 10 player since losing to Iga Swiatek in the Australian Open third round.""It's going to be an extremely challenging match,"" Raducanu said in her on-court interview. ""She's probably in better form, so I can go out and express myself and try and compete for every point.""American Sofia Kenin won a battle of two former Grand Slam champions when she defeated Czech Petra Kvitova 6-4, 7-5.Kenin will now face compatriot and world number three Coco Gauff in the second round.","Nick Kyrgios wins his first match since 2022 at the Miami Open.

CHENNAI: Sankar Muthusamy recorded the biggest win of his nascent career yet, defeating World No. 2 Anders Antonsen of Denmark 18-21, 21-12, 21-5 in the Swiss Open men’s singles pre-quarterfinals in Basel late on Thursday.What surprised many was the way in which the Indian dominated the deciding game. Despite losing the opener, the 21-year-old did not give up and pushed the match to the decider. He was helped by a flurry of unforced errors that Antonsen committed — the Dane hitting the shuttle wide and long on multiple occasions. Sankar made the most of the opportunity and succeeded.The Chennai lad entered the tournament as a qualifier and registered two wins to enter the main draw.“It feels good, and I have been doing well in this tournament. The first game (against Antonsen) lasted for close to 30 minutes and I feel that he became tired after that. I was able to score points from long rallies and capitalised on the situation. I was focusing on one point at a time and did not think much about the result,” Sankar, ranked 64th, told TOI from Basel.“In the deciding game, I was just expecting him to come back at me and was ready to handle the situation. My aim was to move him around the court and make him tired.”Sankar, who was a former junior World No. 1, lacked consistency in the 2024 season due to various reasons. However, he started the 2025 season on a bright note, reaching the quarterfinals of the Thailand Masters. He was later down with fever and could not give his best in the next few tournaments. However, Sankar recovered well ahead of the Swiss Open.The youngster, who is known for his defensive play, has improved his attacking skills and stroke-making.“My strokes have become sharper than usual, and I am able to finish off points from the rear court. My power is gradually increasing, and I am working on it. There is still a long way to go,” he said.Sankar’s long-time coach Aravindan Samiappan said that the win has come at the right time for his ward.“The moment has not sunk in properly. Sankar was an underdog and had nothing to lose. Our plan was to stay neck-to-neck on points and towards the end anything could have happened. But none would have expected such a scoreline in the decider. It was a bit shocking but that happens sometimes,” Aravindan said.The coach feels that opponents can no longer come prepared for Sankar, as he lends unpredictability into his game now.“Sankar can vary the pace of the match whenever required, and this was not the case one and a half years ago. Players could anticipate what he was going to do, as he played at a single pace. Now, you cannot predict him, and that is the major difference in his gameplay,” pointed out the coach.","Sankar Muthusamy defeated World No. 2 Anders Antonsen of Denmark 18-21, 21-12,. 21-5 in the Swiss Open men’s singles pre-quarterfinals in Basel late on Thursday.

NAGPUR: Malvika Bansod rallied from three points (14-17) down to clinch the first game but as luck would have it the 23-year-old world No.23 missed a chance to save the second match point in the decider to go down fighting against higher ranked Michelle Li of Canada, and bow out of the Swiss Open on Wednesday.Though Malvika suffered an early exit from the BWF World Tour Super 300 tournament, the world No.20 Li escaped to win the opening round contest against the Nagpur shuttler.

In a neck-and-neck contest, Canada’s Li won a handful of net shots as Malvika made her higher ranked opponent dance to her tunes with various cross court tricks. But the handful of lucky points through the net that Li won proved crucial in the third and deciding game.Later, India No.1 PV Sindhu suffered yet another first round exit when the seventh seeded, world No.17 lost to Julie Jakobsen 17-21, 19-21.In an all Indian contest, Isharani Baruah surprised Aakarshi Kashyap 18-21, 21-17, 22-20 while Anupama Upadhyaya outplayed Anmol Kharab 21-14, 21-13 to enter the second round of the women’s singles event.Earlier, Kidambi Srikanth beat compatriot HS Prannoy 23-21, 23-21 to enter the men’s singles second round.","Malvika Bansod loses to Michelle Li of Canada in first round of Swiss Open.

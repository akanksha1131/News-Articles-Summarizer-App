Carlos Alcaraz demonstrated his youthful energy and innovative play style to overcome Novak Djokovic in straight sets 6-4, 7-6 (4), 6-2 at the US Open semifinals on Friday. The victory secured his place in his third consecutive Grand Slam final.Djokovic, feeling exhausted by the end, acknowledged his physical limitations. The 38-year-old Serbian reached the semifinals in all four Grand Slams this season but was eliminated at that stage each time, with three losses to either No. 2 Alcaraz, 22, or No. 1 Jannik Sinner, 24.""It's frustrating on the court when you are not able to keep up with that level physically, but at the same time, it's something also expected, I guess. It comes with time and with age,"" Djokovic said.Alcaraz will compete for the championship on Sunday against either defending champion Sinner or No. 25 Felix Auger-Aliassime, with President Donald Trump expected to attend. Sinner aims to become the first repeat men's champion in New York since Roger Federer's five consecutive victories from 2004 to 2008.Alcaraz remains undefeated in sets as he pursues his sixth major title and second at Flushing Meadows.His recent record against Sinner includes a victory at the French Open in June and a loss at Wimbledon in July.Since April, Alcaraz has maintained an impressive 44-2 record, reaching the finals in his last eight tour-level events.""It's something that I'm working on, just the consistency on the matches, on the tournaments, on the year, in general. Just not having up-and-downs in (a) match. Probably, I'm just getting mature, just getting to know myself much better, what I need on, off the court,"" Alcaraz said.Alcaraz had previously lost his two most recent matches against Djokovic at the Paris Olympics last year and in the Australian Open quarterfinals this January.""It's not easy playing against him, to be honest. I'm thinking about the legend; what he has achieved in his career. It's difficult not to think about it,"" he added.Djokovic's pursuit of a historic 25th Grand Slam title was halted again. He attributes part of the challenge to competing against younger players in best-of-five set matches, saying, ""I still want to play ... (a) full Grand Slam season next year. Let's see whether that's going to happen or not, but ... Slams are Slams. They are just different from any other tournament. They are the pillars of our sport, the most important tournaments we have. But I do fancy my chances a bit more in best-of-three.""Alcaraz and Sinner have dominated recent major championships, winning the past seven titles and nine of the last twelve. Djokovic claimed the other three, with his most recent victory at the 2023 US Open.Djokovic showed signs of physical discomfort throughout the match, struggling with his shots and receiving treatment for his neck. The crowd continued to support him with chants of ""No-le!""During the second set, Djokovic briefly took control with a 3-0 lead. However, Alcaraz quickly recovered, winning the next three games.""Today, I'd say, it wasn't the best level of the tournament for me, but I just kept a cool level (from) the beginning until the last point,"" the Serb added.Alcaraz appeared in a pink sleeveless shirt, sporting regrown hair after a recent buzz cut mishap involving his brother.When asked about maintaining his new look if he wins on Sunday, Alcaraz responded with a playful: ""Even better. You will see. ... Surprise, surprise.""","Carlos Alcaraz beats Novak Djokovic 6-4, 7-6 (4), 6-2 in US Open semifinals. Alcarazo will play Jannik Sinner or Felix Auger-Aliassime in Sunday's final.

In a landmark move for tennis-ball cricket in India, the Indian Street Premier League (ISPL) has announced a national competitive framework designed to strengthen grassroots development and create a structured pathway from local tournaments to national recognition.The new system introduces an official League Affiliation Model and Zonal Panel Structure, decentralising governance across eight regions. This model ensures equal opportunities, systematic talent identification, and consistent evaluation across zones.ISPL Core Committee Member Sachin Tendulkar hailed the initiative, emphasising its transformative potential: ""Identifying talent at the grassroots is the first step to building a strong future for the game. With ISPL's new national framework, players from every corner of India now have a clear pathway to nurture their skills and showcase their talent on a bigger stage. This structure ensures every player gets a fair chance to be noticed and progress, turning their love for the game into real opportunities at the national level. ""Under the framework, eight zonal panels — including West (Majhi Mumbai), North (Srinagar Ke Veer), East (Tiigers of Kolkata), and others — will govern cricketing activities in their respective regions.Franchise owners will serve as chairpersons of these panels, supported by scouting heads, tournament representatives, and operations teams.ISPL Commissioner Suraj Samat underlined the league's long-term vision: ""The Indian Street Premier League's remarkable growth is a testament to the immense passion for tennis-ball cricket across the nation. By implementing a rigorous and competitive framework, we are committed to identifying and nurturing emerging talent while strengthening the broader cricketing ecosystem.""The framework includes affiliation opportunities for local tournaments, a performance-based grading system for players, and live rankings of the top 1,000 cricketers on the ISPL app and website. From Season 4, players will only be able to enter the ecosystem through zonal panels, ensuring transparency and meritocracy.Launched in 2024, ISPL has rapidly emerged as a premier platform for tennis-ball cricketers. With player registrations already crossing 4.2 million for the upcoming season, the league has become a genuine pathway to professional cricket. Its credibility is highlighted by players like Abhishek Dalhor, who transitioned from ISPL to a net bowler role with Kolkata Knight Riders in the IPL.Backed by Bollywood superstars and cricket icons, the ISPL continues to reshape grassroots cricket. With its new national competitive framework, the league aims to ensure that no talent in India goes unnoticed.","The Indian Street Premier League (ISPL) has announced a national competitive framework.

NEW DELHI: South African batter Matthew Breetzke , currently riding on red-hot form, admits he is slightly worried that the position of success he finds himself in might only head downhill from here. In the second ODI against England, Breetzke extended his dream run by becoming the first player to register fifty-plus scores in each of his first five ODIs. He dismantled England’s bowling attack with powerful strokeplay, scoring 85 off 77 deliveries to guide South Africa to a formidable 330/8.His innings proved decisive as the Proteas edged past England by five runs to seal an unassailable 2-0 lead in the three-match series. Following his recent heroics, Breetzke now averages 92.60 in ODIs, with previous scores of 150, 83, 57, and 88.Breetzke jokingly admitted that after his ""special start,"" the only way left might be down. While he hopes his fairytale run continues, he rued missing the chance to feature on the Lord’s honours board, falling just 15 runs short of a century.""Very happy, tricky at the start, thought a good score was 280. It was a bit of old-school cricket at the start, batsmanship...read the conditions then score at the back end. It's been good so far [five ODI fifties in a row], hope it continues!,"" Breetzke said.""It's a bit worrying: it can only go downhill for me. It's been a special start, to be honest. I've played on some really good wickets, and I just hope and pray that it'll continue to go the way it's gone... To be honest, I was bleak not to get to a hundred, because it would've been cool to be on the [honours] board,"" he added.The 26-year-old admitted fatigue is natural given cricket’s hectic schedule, but said he remains focused on the bigger picture. ""It does get to you sometimes. But for me, I just look at it like I'm so grateful to be playing a sport for a living. I just try to take every opportunity I get and try to make the most of it. It doesn't last forever.""With South Africa sealing their first ODI series win in England since 1998, Breetzke said the team plans to celebrate if they sweep the series 3-0 in Southampton on Sunday.He believes the team’s growing confidence stems from their historic World Test Championship final win against Australia at the same venue, adding:""It starts at the top with [head coach] Shukri Conrad...

Netherlands held, Belgium win

Germany went down to a shock 2-0 defeat in Slovakia in their opening World Cup qualifier on Thursday, while Spain kicked off their bid to reach next year's finals with a comfortable 3-0 victory in Bulgaria.Atletico Madrid's David Hancko burst untracked into the penalty box to fire Slovakia into the lead just before half-time against Germany in Bratislava.David Strelec, who has just signed for Middlesbrough in the English Championship, then made it two with a brilliant strike high into the top corner 10 minutes into the second half.The result gives Slovakia a dream start in Group A as they attempt to qualify for a first World Cup since 2010.Germany, meanwhile, find themselves immediately under pressure even if this game was their hardest fixture in the group on paper.""We haven't had a great history in recent years and we should have realised that if we want to go to the World Cup and play a good role. Today, we were miles away,"" said Germany coach Julian Nagelsmann.Germany have gone out of each of the last two World Cups in the group stage, but have never failed in a qualifying campaign.""If we perform like we did today, we'll definitely not qualify,"" warned captain Joshua Kimmich.Nagelsmann's side came into the start of their World Cup qualifying campaign off the back of losing both of their matches in the UEFA Nations League Final Four in June, against Portugal and France.They must now react quickly when they entertain Northern Ireland on Tuesday, with Luxembourg their other opponents in the four-team group.Only the group winners qualify directly for the 48-team finals in North America.Northern Ireland won 3-1 in Luxembourg, with Jamie Reid, Shea Charles and Justin Devenny scoring their goals.The home side had gone in on level terms at the break thanks to an Aiman Dardari equaliser, but Seid Korac's second-half red card ended their hopes of taking anything from the contest.European champions Spain, who lost June's Nations League final on penalties to Portugal, had few problems against Bulgaria in Sofia in Group E.Mikel Oyarzabal produced an expert finish from a Martin Zubimendi pass to open the scoring inside five minutes, and Marc Cucurella fired in a superb second goal on the half-hour.Lamine Yamal then set up Mikel Merino for the third goal on 38 minutes, and there was no further scoring.""We're happy but we have to keep taking steps forward,"" said Spain coach Luis de la Fuente.Spain's next game is away to Turkey, who staved off a Georgia comeback to win 3-2 in Tbilisi.Mert Muldur's early opener was followed by two goals either side of half-time by Kerem Akturkoglu, and Turkey appeared to be cruising.However, Zuriko Davitashvili pulled one back and the visitors had Baris Alper Yilmaz sent off.Khvicha Kvaratskhelia then made it 3-2 deep in stoppage time, but Turkey held on for the victory.The Netherlands were held to a 1-1 draw by Poland in Rotterdam in Group G despite taking the lead in the first half through Denzel Dumfries.Matty Cash equalised with a ferocious late strike to deny Ronald Koeman's team, but the Dutch still the top the group on seven points -- they lead Poland and Finland on goal difference, and also boast a game in hand.Lithuania scored a penalty deep in injury time to draw 1-1 with Malta in the same group.Belgium walloped minnows Liechtenstein 6-0 away in Group J, with Maxim De Cuyper opening the scoring.Youri Tielemans netted twice including a penalty, while Arthur Theate, Kevin De Bruyne and Malick Fofana also struck.That result leaves Belgium three points behind group leaders Wales with two games in hand.

A Tanzanian football match came to a dramatic standstill after an unexpected visitor disrupted play: a massive swarm of bees.The unusual incident unfolded mid-game when the swarm descended across the stadium, forcing everyone on the pitch and in the technical area to drop to the ground in an attempt to avoid being stung.Players, coaches, match officials, and even the broadcast crew were all seen lying flat as the buzzing cloud swept over the field.Watch:Footage from the match quickly spread on social media, drawing both shock and amusement from fans.One fan described it as “Football in Tanzania turned into WWE whole stadium hitting the floor for bees instead of goals,"" as another wrote: ""Never seen this type of game management at Upton Park. Bees taking more control of the midfield than most holding players I've coached. At least the lads kept their shape lying down!""Fortunately, no injuries were reported, and the bees eventually moved on, allowing the game to resume.While weather delays, power outages, or pitch invasions are not uncommon in football, incidents involving wildlife are far rarer, though Africa has seen occasional interruptions from animals such as birds, dogs, and even cows wandering into stadiums.For the players, the bee invasion was a moment of real tension, but for global audiences, it became an instant viral clip, showcasing the unpredictability of live sport.The match later continued without further disruption, but fans will likely remember the bizarre stoppage more than the final scoreline.","A massive swarm of bees disrupted a football match in Tanzania.

Jithin had another chance from Uvais' throw in the 66th minute, but his shot went high.Afghanistan's best opportunity came in the 71st minute when Hossein Zamani's cross found Yama Sherzad, whose shot was deflected onto the crossbar by Sandhu.Despite Afghanistan's late pressure, India's defense remained solid to secure the draw.This result marked an improvement for India, who had previously lost to Afghanistan in their March 2024 World Cup Qualifier match.","India have secured a spot in the CAFA Nations Cup third-place match based on head-to-head record.

Tottenham Hotspur fullback Djed Spence has been named in the England squad for the upcoming World Cup qualifiers against Andorra and Serbia, marking his maiden senior call-up. The 25-year-old could also make history by becoming the first openly Muslim footballer to represent the national team.The Football Association has acknowledged the moment as a landmark, ahead of Saturday’s qualifier at Villa Park.

A product of Middlesbrough, he moved to Tottenham in 2022 after impressing at Nottingham Forest.

Along the way, he has faced public criticism from former managers Antonio Conte and Neil Warnock.At Tottenham, the defender has grown into a popular figure.Supporters have consistently backed him, often calling for his inclusion in the starting lineup even when he was on the bench initially.

What’s common between the three Formula E world champions

How the three World Champions fared in Formula E Season 11

Days after Oliver Rowland lifted his Formula E World Championship trophy in London this season, an interesting trend has come to the attention of Formula E and its fans. As a coincidence, all Formula E drivers who won the Mexico City E-Prix went on to win the Formula E World Championship that season, and this has been proved right for three consecutive years.Highlighting the same since 2023, a poster of three World Champions was shared on X by Formula E with the caption, “The trend continues. Each winner of the #MexicoCityEPrix from the past three seasons has gone on to become World Champion.”The special poster features 2023 Formula E World Champion Jake Dennis from Andretti, then TAG Heuer Porsche’s Pascal Wehrlein, who won in 2024, and the new World Champion, Nissan driver Oliver Rowland. All three of them won in the Mexico E-Prix and went on to lift the winner’s trophy in the Formula E World Championship that year.Oliver Rowland had strengthened his chances of winning the Formula E World Championship this year much earlier. He was leading the Formula E Driver Standings ever since he won Part 2 of the Jeddah E-Prix, which was his second win of the season after winning the Mexico E-Prix. In the last leg, the Nissan driver got nervous for a while as Pascal Wehrlein, who was following him in the number two position, closed the gap after grabbing quite a few podiums while Rowland had a dull period.Things became serious for Rowland when he failed to finish the Round 13 race in Berlin, while Wehrlein won second spot on the podium. But he eventually managed to confirm his championship in Berlin after four wins and three more podiums.Sharing about his bad race in Berlin, Rowland had said, “I was hoping before the weekend that the outcome could be [the World Championship], but after yesterday (Saturday) and this morning (Sunday), I was more worried that it might never come.”Also Read: Oliver Rowland reacts to daughter’s sweet radio message after Formula E Championship win: “It’s amazing” Things, however, changed for Wehrlein, who was pushed to third position after Nick Cassidy made a late entry in the Formula E Driver Standings by registering three consecutive wins.

Wehrlein registered one win and five more podiums this season.Meanwhile, Andretti driver Jake Dennis finished in seventh position in the Formula E Driver Standings.

Taylor Barnard on losing top three spot in Formula E World Championship

Fans hail Taylor Barnard for his fantastic rookie season

It was Taylor Barnard’s rookie season this year, and the NEOM McLaren driver put up a fantastic performance by temporarily making it to the top three in the Formula E Driver Standings by ousting the much more experienced Porsche driver Antonio Felix Da Costa.

Finishing P4 in the Drivers’ Championship and coming into the final weekend with a shot at runner-up is something to be proud of.”Also adding a note for teammate Sam Bird, as NEOM McLaren withdrew from Formula E after the end of the season, Barnard wrote, “@sambird_official it wasn’t the weekend you deserved either.You’ve been a huge part of my season both on and off the track, and I’m grateful for everything. You deserved more. To all the Papaya fans, thank you for the incredible support in our final race together. You always go above and beyond. ”Reacting to his post, a fan wrote, “An incredible debut season, huge congrats and excited to see where you go next!” Another said, “I know I said it the other day, but you’ve been incredible to watch this last year and a pleasure to support you in Papaya — there are many of us that can’t wait to support you in whatever you do next!” One more commented, “You were incredible all season around, Taylor.

We couldn’t have done it without you all — your trust and support have never been taken for granted,” he added.Praising the two McLaren drivers, he wrote, “Sam clinched McLaren’s first-ever fully electric win at the São Paulo E-Prix in Season 10, pulling off one of Formula E’s all-time great overtakes, before being waved across the line by none other than Emerson Fittipaldi – McLaren's first Formula 1 World Champion. While Taylor has been a rookie sensation in Season 11, securing five Formula E records, including the youngest driver to start a race, the youngest points scorer, the youngest driver to lead a lap, the youngest podium finisher, and the youngest polesitter. ”He ended the letter saying, “Some of us have been together since the day we first launched this team, while others have seamlessly fitted in along the way and flourished within the environment we have cultivated. For many, I am sure that we will cross paths again soon, but whatever the future holds for those here at Bicester, whatever path they choose to follow, I have no doubt that it will be bright.

From a mental health perspective, I feel a lot lighter, like a weight has come off my shoulders. It’s not something we drivers talk about very often, but the last few days have been a huge release of emotion and energy. It feels great. Even now, when I watch the videos back, I struggle to believe it’s actually done!”Nato had also shared a few pictures of himself and the Nissan team on Instagram after the end of the Formula E season.

What do ABB and Formula E say about the partnership?

After a successful Season 11, ABB and Formula E have announced that they will continue their partnership in the upcoming season. This gives ABB another opportunity to promote its new brand positioning via the ABB FIA Formula E World Championship, along with technologies that help industries take a cleaner route.Over a period of eight seasons, the partnership with Formula E has provided ABB a platform to showcase how technology can help industries outrun challenges, engage with customers around the world, and implement its own solutions into the series to improve reliability and efficiency. The partnership extension will provide a year-round opportunity for brand-building and activation, communicating ABB and its technology solutions to new global audiences, including Formula E’s international fanbase.ABB and Formula E will also join hands to engage a new generation of fans, collaborating with unexpected influencers and content creators to tell compelling stories that make advanced electrification and automation technologies tangible and exciting.The end of the mid-race car swap, a 150kW increase in power, top speeds that are 43 percent higher, and energy recovery increasing from 15 to 50 percent indicate how far Formula E technology has come to outperform on track.ABB has also built on its technical involvement in the series, supplying the race chargers from Season 9, and introducing its ABB Ability OPTIMAX® energy management software (Season 9) and Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) technology (Season 5) to the sport.ABB Head of Brand Paco Liebrand said, “We are pleased to be continuing our partnership with Formula E which, like ABB, is striving for a leaner and cleaner future. The synergy between the two organizations, combined with the global appeal of the Championship, makes it a great platform to promote our brand positioning.”He further said, “Formula E is increasingly working with content creators, influencers, and celebrities, with initiatives such as the Evo Sessions making an impact through digital channels beyond the racing itself, which is also an essential part of ABB’s new brand strategy. Going forward, we will be enhancing the way we harness the benefits of this collaboration, ensuring the focus is on delivering content and activations that reinforce our new messaging, build familiarity, and tell the ‘Engineered to Outrun’ story. ”Formula E Chief Revenue Officer Tiziana Di Gioia said, “Our renewed partnership with ABB is a testament to the commercial power and benefit of Formula E as a global platform that drives both brand and business growth. ABB, like our wider partnership portfolio, has and continues to see enormous value in collaborating with the fastest-growing motorsport on the planet, with viewership, commercial integration, and brand storytelling continuing to accelerate. Over eight seasons, ABB has moved from brand visibility to brand activation—integrating deeply into the fan experience, the sport’s ecosystem, and our innovation narrative.Also Read: Antonio Felix Da Costa shares happy memories as Porsche wins Formula E Teams and Manufacturers’ World Championships “This next chapter elevates the partnership even further. With ABB’s new positioning, we are co-creating opportunities across content, digital storytelling, and market engagement, transforming a title partnership into a year-round, value-generating relationship. It’s a model of how modern sponsorships should evolve, rooted in purpose and cultural alignment but measured by impact,” she added.Formula E Season 12 will begin with testing in Valencia in October.","ABB and Formula E have announced that they will continue their partnership in the upcoming season.

Poll Do you believe Amanda Anisimova can win her first major title at the US Open? Yes, she has the potential. No, Aryna Sabalenka is too strong.

NEW DELHI: There's a powerful and inspiring motto on the hit Apple TV+ series Ted Lasso where Coach Lasso (Jason Sudekis) asks player Sam Obisanya (Toheeb Jimoh) to ""be a goldfish"", effectively urging him to forget what just happened and start afresh.Amanda Anisimova, possibly, saw that episode and embraced it to the tee. On 12 July, she lost 0-6, 0-6 in her first Grand Slam final at Wimbledon, the most lopsided women's final at SW19 in 114 years. Two days ago, 52 days after that hammering, Anisimova got her revenge over Iga Swiatek in the US Open semi-final.On Thursday-turned-into-Friday, she booked her place in the US Open final after beating former World No. 1 and four-time major champion Naomi Osaka 6-7, 7-6, 6-3 in a match that finished at almost 1am, unfortunately in front of sparse crowd.On Saturday, Anisimova, 24, will once again look to win her first major title, 61 miles from where she was born in New Jersey. In her path will be defending champion Aryna Sabalenka, who has not missed a Grand Slam final on hard courts since 2022.Anisimova vs Sabalenka, too, will be a repeat of a Wimbledon contest where the American stunned the Belarussian in the semi-final.""I felt like I wasn't playing my tennis because I was nervous, and I was letting the stress get to me a little bit, but then I tried to dig deep and find my game,"" said Anisimova in the post-match press conference.""I just keep telling myself that I can do it, and I believe in myself. I keep saying that over and over again, not just in the match, but the whole day.""But I really try and tell my brain, or I guess I feel like manifest it or visualise it, then it will happen. I just try and stay upbeat and positive.""At one point in the second set, after six breaks of serves were exchanged, member in her team chimed in and told her to ""stop making excuses."" She tried to keep herself upbeat as well by clenching her fist after crucial moments and yelling out, 'let's *-ing go!'Even before the first ball was hit, Anisimova would have thought the odds were stacked against her. Osaka had never lost at a major when she made at least the quarterfinals.Then as errors continued to flow off the American's racket, that belief would have been strengthened. Only once before had Osaka lost at a major after winning the opening set.With 23 unforced errors in comparison to Osaka's 10, Anisimova, whose parents hail from Russia, stayed in it. At least the winner count was in the 24-year-old's favour (17 to 9).By the end of the 2-hour-56-minute match, that trend continued as Anisimova displayed more errors (45-27) but edged out the two-time US Open winner due to her thumping winners tally (50-32).""Today, I could have easily said, 'Oh, she's playing better than me, and I can't really do anything,'"" said Anisimova.""I really tried to find a way, any way, I could to stay in the match, even though it was extremely tough, and she was playing really great tennis.""I have really worked on myself to really be able to handle those moments and to believe in myself, even when it feels like what is there to believe in, in a way, like, when you're not playing that well.""It took three match points for Anisimova to get past the finish line. And with foray into the final, she's kept the flag flying for the American women even if the drought among the men continues. An American has featured in five straight Grand Slams now - Jessica Pegula, Madison Keys, Coco Gauff and Anisimova twice.With Anisimova reaching the final at both Wimbledon and the US Open, it is the first time since 2002 that at least one American woman has appeared in all four major finals in a single calendar year. Further, at least one American woman has featured in a Grand Slam final in a calendar year since 2007.When Anisimova steps on the court on Saturday, to win her first major title, it would be with the knowledge that she has to become that goldfish all over again. New day, new final.","Amanda Anisimova beat Naomi Osaka 6-7, 7-6, 6-3 in US Open semi-final. The 24-year-old will face defending champion Aryna Sabalenka in Saturday's final. She lost to the Belarussian in the Wimbledon final in July. The American has appeared in all four major finals in a calendar year.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123716773,imgsize-51342,width-400,resizemode-4/anisimova-0509-ap.jpg"

Naomi Osaka had planned to create a final Labubu plush toy resembling herself for the U.S. Open. Her semifinal loss prevented this plan from becoming reality.""Oh, don't make me cry, man,"" the four-time Grand Slam champion said during her press conference early Friday morning after her 6-7 (4), 7-6 (3), 6-3 semifinal loss to Amanda Anisimova. ""Oh my God, the most devastating question.""Throughout the tournament at Flushing Meadows, Osaka carried different versions of the popular plush toy attached to her racket bag.She named them creatively, including Billie Jean Bling, Althea Glitterson, and Arthur Flashe, paying tribute to tennis legends Billie Jean King, Althea Gibson, and Arthur Ashe.For the final match, Osaka had intended to design a Labubu inspired by her previous tournament appearance. The design would have featured her green skirt from last year's tournament, which she won in 2018 and 2020, along with a green bow on a white jacket.""I would have had the bow, and I'm sick about it,"" Osaka said. ""Oh, my God, that's like the worst thing. Honestly, I'm fine losing, but don't ask me about this Labubu, man. Yeah, it would have been me.""","Naomi Osaka lost 6-7 (4), 7-6 (3), 6-3 to Amanda Anisimova. Osaka had planned to create a final Labubu plush toy resembling herself.

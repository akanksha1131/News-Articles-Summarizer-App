Poll How impressed are you with Dewald Brevis's performance in T20 cricket so far? Very Impressed Somewhat Impressed Not Impressed Neutral

Chennai: As South African youngster Dewald Brevis lit up Darwin with a 56-ball 125 not out to help the Proteas draw level in the T20 series against Australia, AB de Villiers didn’t waste too much time in coming up with a cryptic tweet.“There was such a golden opportunity for IPL teams to pick up Dewald Brevis at the auction! Missed out badly. CSK either got very lucky or maybe the biggest master stroke ever. The boy can play,” De Villiers wrote on X.CSK had one of their worst IPL seasons in 2025, but the silver lining was acquiring ‘Baby AB’, who has been a big hit in the T20 circuit across the world since then.CSK, though, didn’t have any plans of getting Brevis and it was a combination of desperation, smart thinking and “a bit of fluke” that led the five-time champions roping him in after eight games.“We had lost six of the first eight games and knew that our season was gone. And remember, we didn’t get Brevis as a replacement for a batter. He came in for medium-pacer Gurjapneet Singh,” a CSK source told TOI.Brevis had played a couple of seasons of IPL before for Mumbai Indians and got only 10 games, doing nothing spectacular. He was released by MI, a decision that they may end up regretting, but none of the franchises showed any interest in him during the auctions.“He had seemed a suspect against spin in the first two seasons and the data of the player didn’t suggest anything special. But with Ruturaj Gaikwad out with an injury, we were lacking firepower up top and with no chance to make the play-offs, there was scope to experiment,” the source said.Even then, Brevis was not a straight-forward choice and CSK had thought about Jonny Bairstow, who had also gone unsold in the auction.“Bairstow had experience, but by then we were ready to take a chance with young guns,” the source said.It was coach Stephen Fleming ’s suggestion “to take a chance with Brevis”. MS Dhoni , too, gave his nod banking on the youth factor and the 22-year-old came in to become an immediate success, scoring 42 off 25 balls against SRH in a low-scoring match at the MA Chidambaram Stadium. He followed it up with a few sparkling innings that scuppered the progress of teams like KKR and Gujarat Titans.While Brevis has gone from strength to strength since then, culminating in the highest individual innings score by a South African in T20Is on Tuesday, the CSK management still believes he isn’t a finished product. The belief in the franchise is that the youngster is going to get better and CSK are ready to give him a long rope so that he can realize his potential and become one of their brave new faces.",Dewald Brevis scored 125 not out in South Africa's T20 win over Australia.

IND vs ENG: Mohammed Siraj reflects on memorable win at The Oval

Poll Which series do you think had more dramatic moments? 2025 India-England Series 2005 Ashes Series

Former England captain Michael Atherton has rated the recently concluded India-England five-Test series and drawn comparisons to the iconic 2005 Ashes series.In conversation with ex-England skipper and commentator Nasser Hussain, Atherton dismissed comparisons that placed the contest above the iconic Ashes battle but admitted it came closest in terms of drama and twists.“No, I don’t think the quality was as good as ’05. I mean, I don’t think I’ll see a better series than the ’05 Ashes. One team on the rise, one great team on the decline, an emerging team with absolutely great players at the top of their game,” Atherton said on Sky Sports Cricket.He explained that while 2005 set an unmatched benchmark, this latest series stood out for its unpredictable nature. “I’d probably put this one as the best since ’05 because of those dramatic moments — like Chris Woakes, and Rishabh Pant, and the way the series twisted and turned. So I reckon it’s probably the best series I’ve covered since ’05,” he added.The five-match contest ended 2-2 after India sealed a tense victory in the final Test at The Oval. The last day saw wickets fall quickly and emotions run high in a fiercely fought battle between the two sides.In contrast, the 2005 Ashes, which is widely considered one of the greatest Test series in history, saw England edge Australia 2-1 to reclaim the urn for the first time since 1986-87. That series remains remembered for its high-quality cricket, nail-biting finishes and lasting impact on the sport.While Atherton’s verdict doesn't place the series on par or better than the 2005 Ashes, he still placed the India-England clash in elite company. The 2025 Ashes will commence on November 21.","Former England captain Michael Atherton has rated the India-England five-Test series.

NEW DELHI: With the SA20 auction around the corner, former South African all-rounder Chris Morris expects Aiden Markram to be among the biggest draws when bidding begins on September 9 in Johannesburg.""Sunrisers haven't retained him, but they do have a right-to-match card, meaning they can match the final bid for him and retain his services,"" Morris said, as quoted by SA20.""That opens the door for mind games -- other teams could bid aggressively to push his price high enough to make it difficult for the Sunrisers to bring him back,"" he added.Morris pointed to two franchises that could target the Proteas batter.""Two teams stand out to me: MI Cape Town, which would solve their captaincy question -- not that Rashid Khan is doing a bad job -- but having a successful local international captain at number four would be a big boost, especially since they've released Rassie van der Dussen, leaving a vacancy at number three. The other is Pretoria Capitals, who have one of the largest remaining purses. He's a local player, would fill their captaincy role, slot in at number three, and bring strong leadership after Rilee Rossouw's stint last year. Either way, Aiden Markram is going to be hot property,"" he said.The SA20 has grown quickly since its inception, with last year’s auction attracting nearly 600 player registrations from around the world.This year’s retained and pre-signed list already features big names such as Nicholas Pooran, Andre Russell, Sunil Narine, and England’s Jos Buttler and Jonny Bairstow.Each franchise was allowed a maximum of six retained or pre-signed players during the retention window, which closed on July 18, comprising up to three South African and three overseas players. Teams have also completed their six wildcard signings, with attention now shifting to the remaining slots. A total purse of USD 7.4 million will be spent to fill the 84 available places at the September 9 auction in Johannesburg.For Season 4, a wildcard player could be any overseas cricketer or a South African who was part of the team’s squad in Season 3.

Poll Are you excited to see Rohit Sharma return for the ODI series against Australia? Yes, can't wait! No, not really.

Zaheer Khan: 'Rishabh Pant's calibre and ability never in doubt'

NEW DELHI: India’s cricketing stars were back together — at least for one evening — as former pacer Zaheer Khan shared a smiling picture with ODI skipper Rohit Sharma and former all-rounder Yuvraj Singh Zaheer posted the photograph on Instagram with the caption, “Buggi night with Shana log,” giving fans a throwback to the camaraderie during their playing days. The reunion came at an eventful time for both Zaheer and Rohit, albeit for different reasons.For Rohit, the get-together capped a week that saw him climb to No. 2 in the ICC ODI batting rankings, overtaking Pakistan’s Babar Azam. With 756 points, the 38-year-old sits just behind Test captain Shubman Gill (784). The rise comes despite Rohit not having played an ODI since India’s Champions Trophy triumph earlier this year, with his last competitive outing being in the 2025 IPL season. Former captain Virat Kohli holds fourth spot (736), while Shreyas Iyer (8th) and KL Rahul (15th) give India a strong top-15 presence.Rohit, who has retired from Tests and T20Is, is currently on a break and is expected to return for the three-match ODI series against Australia in October.For Zaheer, the week brought a different kind of headline. As TimesofIndia.com reported earlier, the Lucknow Super Giants are set to part ways with their mentor ahead of IPL 2026. According to sources, LSG will appoint a new mentor with a bigger, cross-franchise role, while owner Sanjiv Goenka is expected to name a Director of Cricket to oversee RPSG Group’s other teams, including Durban’s Super Giants (SA20) and Manchester Originals (The Hundred).","Rohit Sharma climbs to No. 2 in ICC ODI batting rankings, overtaking Babar Azam.

Halka sa seam hota hai toh musibat pad jaati hai

Rawalpindi pitch lekar nahi ghoom sakte

Former Pakistan speedster Shoaib Akhtar has slammed the Mohammed Rizwan-led side for their poor performance in the ODI series against the West Indies.The West Indies clinched their first ODI series victory over Pakistan since 1991 with a commanding 202-run win in the decisive third match at Tarouba on Tuesday. Fast bowler Jayden Seales produced stunning figures of 6-18, while captain Shai Hope struck an unbeaten century as the hosts bowled out Pakistan for just 92 while defending 294-6.Akhtar lambasted Pakistan’s batters, accusing them of not playing for the team.“We used to have expressive and explosive talent, and we played like that. We were never dependent on one individual — everyone chipped in,” Akhtar said on the Game On Hai show.“No one used to look for escape routes. The environment has changed, and in the last 10–15 years, everyone has started playing for themselves. Everyone is playing for their averages. The intent should be to win matches for your country.“We need to change the intent, the mindset, and create that atmosphere. You need to play according to modern cricket. How hard is that to understand?” he added.Pakistan’s chase fell apart early, collapsing to 23-4 in the ninth over, with three ducks among the top four batters.Opener Saim Ayub was caught behind on the third ball of the innings, Abdullah Shafique also failed to score, and captain Mohammad Rizwan was bowled by Seales for a golden duck in the third over.Seales claimed his fourth wicket when he trapped Babar Azam (9) lbw.(The ball moves a bit and they are in trouble),” Akhtar said. “(You can’t carry Pindi pitches everywhere).”","Shoaib Akhtar has slammed Pakistan's batting in the ODI series against the West Indies.

The brand equation

New Delhi, Aug 8 (IANS) Former India wicketkeeper-batter Parthiv Patel believes Test skipper Shubman Gill answered all challenges and questions through his prolific run-scoring spree during the recently drawn Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy series against England.

Numbers don’t lie

New Delhi, Aug 7 (IANS) After captaining India to a 2-2 Test series draw in England, Shubman Gill has been appointed as the captain of the North Zone squad for the upcoming Duleep Trophy, starting on August 28 in Bengaluru.

Poll Do you believe Shubman Gill can fill the leadership void left by Kohli and Sharma? Absolutely Somewhat Not really Not at all

In the past few weeks, social media videos have been doing the rounds where Shubman Gill 's dismissals in Test cricket and then his centuries in the recently concluded Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy have been heavily compared. The lyrics from the songby singer Rahgir have been used, and the line says: “” (Those who are mocking me for my failures today will clap for my story tomorrow).Eyebrows were raised when he was appointed as India's Test captain, with legends of the game questioning his spot in the playing XI. He answered his critics with 754 runs, almost overhauling Sunil Gavaskar's all-time record, and was presented with a customised shirt and cap by the 'Little Master.'Shubman Gill, a Gen Z, used Karan Aujla's famous trackon his Insagram with the caption, “The storm only rattles those who aren't ready for it.” He answered all his critics in a very nonchalant way -- both with his bat and his captaincy.England wicketkeeper-batter Jos Buttler , who played under Gill's captaincy at the Gujarat Titans, has called his style of leadership a combination of the “intensity” of Virat Kohli and the “more laid-back” approach of Rohit Sharma . Buttler was right -- Gill hassled England with intent and elegance.The Board of Control for Cricket in India ( BCCI ) took a gamble, and Shubman swiftly filled the void left by Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma -- two of its biggest modern-day giants.Gill is not only filling the void with runs and leadership but also in brand value, and has already become the darling of the broadcasters. The leap can be gauged by MRF's investment on legendary batters going from Sachin Tendulkar to Virat Kohli and now Gill in a deal estimated to be worth Rs 8-10 crore per year.Remember the Virat Kohli Cam and Rohit Sharma Cam that broadcasters added to keep fans glued? Shubman is their answer.The other poster boy of Indian cricket is Jasprit Bumrah, hands down the magician who wears many hats. But with his persistent back injury and workload management, he won't be playing all of India’s matches.From a commercial standpoint, Kohli and Rohit weren’t just cricketers; they were multi-million-dollar brands. Their mere presence boosted television ratings, ticket sales, and sponsorship value. Broadcasters built campaigns around them. Sponsors tailored entire ad shoots to their availability. Losing both at once was always going to create a vacuum, and the BCCI’s marketing minds are well aware that a successor must be groomed not just on the field, but in the marketplace.With Shubman Gill, they have a young poster boy for the next generation. With his elegant strokeplay, calm demeanour, and youthful appeal, he has already become a favourite with advertisers. Suryakumar Yadav has an impressive track record as India’s full-time T20I captain after Rohit Sharma retired from the format following the 2024 T20 World Cup triumph. Under his leadership, India have won 17 out of 22 matches.There is no question about Surya the T20I batter -- he can entertain the crowd. But can he fill stadiums?This is the question coach Gautam Gambhir, chief selector Ajit Agarkar, and top BCCI officials will have to answer during the Asia Cup squad selection, given that the T20 World Cup will be played at home. Will they extend the line of thought by giving Shubman the white-ball captaincy as well? It would also make life easier for coach Gambhir. No coach anywhere in the world would want to deal with different captains for different formats.By no means is Shubman Gill a dud in the T20I format.In 21 T20Is, his strike rate is close to 140, and with added responsibility, he can only flourish - as seen in England. His Test average was in the mid-30s before the start of the Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy, and he ended up chasing Don Bradman's batting record. Gill has shown that he is someone who will not buckle under added responsibility; instead, he thrives on it.In the IPL , he captains Gujarat Titans. In the first season, he showed some vulnerability but bounced back in his second season as captain, guiding them to the playoffs.Since moving to Titans from Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR), Gill has risen immediately to the leadership group under then-captain Hardik Pandya. He was pivotal in Titans winning the IPL title in 2022 with 483 runs at the top. Next season, he responded with an 890-run season with a strike rate of 157.80. In the last three IPL seasons, his strike rates have been 158.80, 147.40, and 155.88.His childhood mentor Gurkeerat Singh Mann has explained how Gill worked on his power-hitting.“He has always been a traditional batter, who was told by his father that hitting in the air is a sin in cricket. But once he was tipped as not good enough for T20I cricket, he added that power game to his repertoire -- and now see the sixes he hits, all of them above 90m,” Mann told TimesofIndia.com.“Before he joined Gujarat Titans, he started training in an open net at the IS Bindra Stadium in Mohali. He wanted to make sure that he was hitting it long and big. He was not happy with the sixes falling just behind the ropes. He used to get miffed.

Sachin Tendulkar at 52: Power, Pride, and a Nation’s Pulse

Poll Which aspect of Rahul Dravid's career do you admire the most? His technique His temperament His consistency

NEW DELHI: Former India pacer RP Singh has shared a witty 1999 exchange with cricket legend Rahul Dravid about Master Blaster Sachin Tendulkar , offering a glimpse into Dravid’s understated sense of humour.Speaking on the latest episode of JioHotstar special Cheeky Singles, Singh recalled a Ranji Trophy clash in Meerut between Karnataka and Uttar Pradesh, where Dravid scored a commanding 199. That evening, the two attended dinner at a friend’s house while an India match was being broadcast on TV.“There was a Ranji Trophy match going on in Meerut, Karnataka vs Uttar Pradesh. Rahul Dravid bhai had come to play and scored 199 runs. That night, we went to dinner at someone's house. India’s match was going on that day, and Sachin paaji was batting. He was playing a run-a-ball innings. We were both sitting on the side, and people were saying, ‘Sachin should play a little faster.’ But he was playing according to the situation of the match. Rahul bhai whispered in my ear, ‘If they are saying so much to him, then how much would they have said to me?’” Singh recounted.Nicknamed “The Wall” for his rock-solid technique, Dravid was renowned for his patient batting style, often testing the resolve of bowlers and fans alike. By the time he retired, he had piled up 13,288 runs in 164 Tests with 36 centuries, and 10,889 runs in 344 ODIs, including 12 hundreds — numbers that firmly establish him among cricket’s all-time greats.","Former India pacer RP Singh has shared a witty exchange with cricket legend Rahul Dravid about Sachin Tendulkar.

NEW DELHI: A man from Madagaon village in Chhattisgarh’s Gariaband district had an unexpected brush with the cricketing world after buying a SIM card that once belonged to Royal Challengers Bengaluru captain Rajat Patidar . The purchase led to surprise calls from stars like Virat Kohli and AB de Villiers.Manish Bisi and his friend Khemraj first grew suspicious when, upon installing WhatsApp on the newly bought SIM from a local shop, they saw Patidar’s profile picture.Their curiosity turned to disbelief as they began receiving calls from cricket celebrities including Kohli, de Villiers, and Yash Dayal. At first, they assumed it was a prank by friends — until Patidar himself called on July 15, asking for the SIM card’s return.The incident prompted Indian spinner Ravichandran Ashwin — who retired from international cricket last year but continues in the IPL — to recall a similar situation in which he nearly fell victim to a scammer impersonating his Chennai Super Kings teammate Devon Conway ""After the IPL got over, one guy messaged me, claiming to be Devon Conway, 'Hi buddy, how are you?' and I also responded, 'We'll stay in touch. You're playing in MLC; I'll watch the games.'He then asked, 'I've lost Virat Kohli's number, can you share it?' I thought, why is he asking for Virat's number? I thought I should ask him, but I didn't want Devon Conway to misunderstand. Then I picked Virat Kohli's card and gave him a different number,"" Ashwin revealed on his YouTube channel.""Once I shared it, he replied, 'I've lost a few more numbers.' I asked whose numbers, and he responded, ' Rohit Sharma and MS Dhoni .' I got suspicious and thought somebody was playing a prank. I then asked him a question, 'I gave you a bat this year, how's that bat?' He said the bat is amazing, but I hadn't even given him any bat. He lied, and I blocked him instantly. The guy took a chance. I went back to the CSK group and checked Devon Conway's number, and it was not the same. At least I had the smarts to send the duplicate card of Virat. It was his WhatsApp number in Australia. Thank goodness, because he was asking for everybody's numbers.""These incidents serve as a reminder of the growing need to protect personal information in the digital era, especially for high-profile cricketers.",Manish Bisi bought a SIM card that once belonged to Royal Challengers Bengaluru captain Rajat Patidar.

Poll Who do you think was the standout player for PSG in the match against Tottenham? Lee Kang-in Goncalo Ramos Nuno Mendes Lucas Chevalier

Paris Saint-Germain secured their fifth trophy of 2025 by defeating Tottenham 4-3 in a penalty shootout at the UEFA Super Cup in Udine, Italy on Wednesday. PSG mounted a remarkable comeback, scoring two late goals to force penalties before clinching victory in the annual match between Champions League and Europa League winners.The match seemed to be going Tottenham's way when they established a 2-0 lead early in the second half through goals from their defenders. Micky van de Ven opened the scoring in the 39th minute, capitalizing after PSG's new goalkeeper Lucas Chevalier tipped Joao Palhinha's shot onto the crossbar.Newly appointed Tottenham captain Cristian Romero doubled the lead in the 48th minute with a header that Chevalier failed to save. Chevalier was playing in place of Gianluigi Donnarumma , who had announced his departure from PSG the day before.PSG, despite being less prepared due to their recent Club World Cup involvement until mid-July, showed remarkable resilience in the closing stages. Lee Kang-in brought them back into the game with a powerful low shot from the edge of the area in the 85th minute.Goncalo Ramos then forced the match into penalties with a dramatic equalizer, heading home Ousmane Dembele's cross in the fourth minute of stoppage time.In the penalty shootout, PSG overcame an early miss by Vitinha to convert their next four attempts.Tottenham's Van de Ven and Mathys Tel failed to score, ultimately leading to Nuno Mendes securing victory with the decisive penalty.The match marked Thomas Frank's first competitive game as Tottenham manager, having replaced Ange Postecoglou in the offseason. Postecoglou had led Spurs to their first trophy in 17 years with a Europa League final victory over Manchester United in May.The Super Cup victory adds to PSG's impressive trophy haul, following their Champions League-Ligue 1-Coupe de France treble last season and the Trophee des Champions victory in January. Their only setback came in the Club World Cup final loss to Chelsea.Tottenham appeared sharper throughout much of the match, benefiting from more extensive preseason preparation compared to PSG's players, who had only recently returned to training following their Club World Cup commitments.","Paris Saint-Germain defeated Tottenham 4-3 in a penalty shootout at the UEFA Super Cup in Udine, Italy on Wednesday.

As Liverpool prepare for the 2025-26 Premier League campaign, both current manager Arne Slot and former boss Jürgen Klopp have paid heartfelt tributes to late forward Diogo Jota , whose sudden death in July sent shockwaves through the football world.Jota, 28, died in a car accident in Spain while travelling with his brother. Signed from Wolverhampton Wanderers in September 2020, the Portugal international quickly became a vital presence at Anfield. He scored six goals in 26 appearances during the Reds’ triumphant 2024-25 Premier League campaign and was also part of the side that reached the 2021/22 Champions League final.On JioHotstar’s Preview of the Season 2025-26, Slot reflected on Jota’s winning legacy.“He was a champion for his family, which is the most important thing. He was a champion for his country, winning the Nations League for a nation he loves and cares deeply about. And he was a champion for us by helping win the Premier League,” Slot said.Klopp, who managed Jota for most of his Liverpool career, highlighted how his presence transformed the team’s style of play.“Diogo was an incredibly important player for us. Having him in the side changed the dynamics,” Klopp remarked, underlining the tactical flexibility and cutting edge the forward brought to his squads.Before arriving in England, Jota’s career began in his hometown of Porto with Paços de Ferreira. A 2016 move to Atletico Madrid saw him loaned back to Portugal before finding his stride at Wolves under Nuno Espírito Santo. For Portugal, Jota appeared at Euro 2022 and Euro 2024, and was part of the Nations League-winning squad in May this year.","Liverpool manager Arne Slot and former boss Jürgen Klopp have paid heartfelt tributes to late forward Diogo Jota.

Poll Do you agree with Marcus Rashford's assessment of Manchester United's managerial instability? Yes, completely agree Do not agree

Marcus Rashford has criticised Manchester United ’s lack of long-term vision, saying the club’s constant managerial changes have left it “in no man’s land.”The 27-year-old forward, who came through United’s academy and made 426 appearances for the club, joined Barcelona on loan after spending the second half of last season at Aston Villa. United endured a disastrous campaign, finishing 15th in the Premier League, which was their worst since 1973/74, and also missed out on European football.Speaking on The Rest Is Football podcast, Rashford said United’s instability stems from having six different managers since Sir Alex Ferguson retired in 2013.“We have been way below where we deem United to be but then if you take a step back, which I've been able to do, especially over these last six months, what do you expect?” Rashford said.“When Liverpool went through this, they got (Jurgen) Klopp, they stuck with him. They didn't win in the beginning. People only remember his final few years when he was competing with (Manchester) City and winning the biggest trophies.“To start a transition, you have to make a plan and stick to it. It's not easy to do. But this is where I speak about being realistic with what your situation is. We've had that many different managers, different ideas and different strategies to win that you end up in no man's land.”Rashford, who scored 138 goals and won two FA Cups and two League Cups for United, believes the club’s identity has eroded since Ferguson’s era.“When Ferguson was in charge, not only were there principles for the first team but they were for the whole academy,” he said. “If your direction is always changing, you can't expect to win the league.”His Barcelona loan includes an option to buy for €35 million at the end of his loan spell.

A Cobham graduate and lifelong Blue, the 25-year-old has established himself as a leader within the squad, particularly after leading Chelsea to the Club World Cup title. The triumph holds special significance for the Chelsea captain. “Winning any title for this club is obviously a dream. To do so in the style we did, especially against the opponents we faced (PSG), meant a great deal,” he told TOI over an e-mail interview.Under Enzo Maresca’s leadership, as the squad evolves with new signings and departing players, James has assumed greater responsibility on and off the pitch. “It’s a natural part of top-level football—players come and go,” he says. “What’s important is that every new arrival understands our goals, our playing philosophy, and the standards expected at Chelsea.” James’ role in maintaining the club’s culture is central to ensuring that unity and accountability persist amidst changes.During the 2024-25 campaign, Chelsea secured victories in both the Club World Cup and the UEFA Conference Cup, in addition to finishing fourth in the Premier League. James views these achievements as evidence of the team progressing in the right direction. “Last season was a big step forward,” he reflects. “The manager brought a clear vision and a way of playing that the squad quickly adapted to. We believe we’re moving in the right direction and want to be right in that title race. ”Despite facing injuries in recent seasons, James remains a crucial figure.

What’s common between the three Formula E world champions

How the three World Champions fared in Formula E Season 11

Days after Oliver Rowland lifted his Formula E World Championship trophy in London this season, an interesting trend has come to the attention of Formula E and its fans. As a coincidence, all Formula E drivers who won the Mexico City E-Prix went on to win the Formula E World Championship that season, and this has been proved right for three consecutive years.Highlighting the same since 2023, a poster of three World Champions was shared on X by Formula E with the caption, “The trend continues. Each winner of the #MexicoCityEPrix from the past three seasons has gone on to become World Champion.”The special poster features 2023 Formula E World Champion Jake Dennis from Andretti, then TAG Heuer Porsche’s Pascal Wehrlein, who won in 2024, and the new World Champion, Nissan driver Oliver Rowland. All three of them won in the Mexico E-Prix and went on to lift the winner’s trophy in the Formula E World Championship that year.Oliver Rowland had strengthened his chances of winning the Formula E World Championship this year much earlier. He was leading the Formula E Driver Standings ever since he won Part 2 of the Jeddah E-Prix, which was his second win of the season after winning the Mexico E-Prix. In the last leg, the Nissan driver got nervous for a while as Pascal Wehrlein, who was following him in the number two position, closed the gap after grabbing quite a few podiums while Rowland had a dull period.Things became serious for Rowland when he failed to finish the Round 13 race in Berlin, while Wehrlein won second spot on the podium. But he eventually managed to confirm his championship in Berlin after four wins and three more podiums.Sharing about his bad race in Berlin, Rowland had said, “I was hoping before the weekend that the outcome could be [the World Championship], but after yesterday (Saturday) and this morning (Sunday), I was more worried that it might never come.”Also Read: Oliver Rowland reacts to daughter’s sweet radio message after Formula E Championship win: “It’s amazing” Things, however, changed for Wehrlein, who was pushed to third position after Nick Cassidy made a late entry in the Formula E Driver Standings by registering three consecutive wins.

Wehrlein registered one win and five more podiums this season.Meanwhile, Andretti driver Jake Dennis finished in seventh position in the Formula E Driver Standings.

Taylor Barnard on losing top three spot in Formula E World Championship

Fans hail Taylor Barnard for his fantastic rookie season

It was Taylor Barnard’s rookie season this year, and the NEOM McLaren driver put up a fantastic performance by temporarily making it to the top three in the Formula E Driver Standings by ousting the much more experienced Porsche driver Antonio Felix Da Costa.

Finishing P4 in the Drivers’ Championship and coming into the final weekend with a shot at runner-up is something to be proud of.”Also adding a note for teammate Sam Bird, as NEOM McLaren withdrew from Formula E after the end of the season, Barnard wrote, “@sambird_official it wasn’t the weekend you deserved either.You’ve been a huge part of my season both on and off the track, and I’m grateful for everything. You deserved more. To all the Papaya fans, thank you for the incredible support in our final race together. You always go above and beyond. ”Reacting to his post, a fan wrote, “An incredible debut season, huge congrats and excited to see where you go next!” Another said, “I know I said it the other day, but you’ve been incredible to watch this last year and a pleasure to support you in Papaya — there are many of us that can’t wait to support you in whatever you do next!” One more commented, “You were incredible all season around, Taylor.

We couldn’t have done it without you all — your trust and support have never been taken for granted,” he added.Praising the two McLaren drivers, he wrote, “Sam clinched McLaren’s first-ever fully electric win at the São Paulo E-Prix in Season 10, pulling off one of Formula E’s all-time great overtakes, before being waved across the line by none other than Emerson Fittipaldi – McLaren's first Formula 1 World Champion. While Taylor has been a rookie sensation in Season 11, securing five Formula E records, including the youngest driver to start a race, the youngest points scorer, the youngest driver to lead a lap, the youngest podium finisher, and the youngest polesitter. ”He ended the letter saying, “Some of us have been together since the day we first launched this team, while others have seamlessly fitted in along the way and flourished within the environment we have cultivated. For many, I am sure that we will cross paths again soon, but whatever the future holds for those here at Bicester, whatever path they choose to follow, I have no doubt that it will be bright.

How do Formula E and ABB work together?

What do ABB and Formula E say about the partnership?

After a successful Season 11, ABB and Formula E have announced that they will continue their partnership in the upcoming season. This gives ABB another opportunity to promote its new brand positioning via the ABB FIA Formula E World Championship, along with technologies that help industries take a cleaner route.Over a period of eight seasons, the partnership with Formula E has provided ABB a platform to showcase how technology can help industries outrun challenges, engage with customers around the world, and implement its own solutions into the series to improve reliability and efficiency. The partnership extension will provide a year-round opportunity for brand-building and activation, communicating ABB and its technology solutions to new global audiences, including Formula E’s international fanbase.ABB and Formula E will also join hands to engage a new generation of fans, collaborating with unexpected influencers and content creators to tell compelling stories that make advanced electrification and automation technologies tangible and exciting.The end of the mid-race car swap, a 150kW increase in power, top speeds that are 43 percent higher, and energy recovery increasing from 15 to 50 percent indicate how far Formula E technology has come to outperform on track.ABB has also built on its technical involvement in the series, supplying the race chargers from Season 9, and introducing its ABB Ability OPTIMAX® energy management software (Season 9) and Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) technology (Season 5) to the sport.ABB Head of Brand Paco Liebrand said, “We are pleased to be continuing our partnership with Formula E which, like ABB, is striving for a leaner and cleaner future. The synergy between the two organizations, combined with the global appeal of the Championship, makes it a great platform to promote our brand positioning.”He further said, “Formula E is increasingly working with content creators, influencers, and celebrities, with initiatives such as the Evo Sessions making an impact through digital channels beyond the racing itself, which is also an essential part of ABB’s new brand strategy. Going forward, we will be enhancing the way we harness the benefits of this collaboration, ensuring the focus is on delivering content and activations that reinforce our new messaging, build familiarity, and tell the ‘Engineered to Outrun’ story. ”Formula E Chief Revenue Officer Tiziana Di Gioia said, “Our renewed partnership with ABB is a testament to the commercial power and benefit of Formula E as a global platform that drives both brand and business growth. ABB, like our wider partnership portfolio, has and continues to see enormous value in collaborating with the fastest-growing motorsport on the planet, with viewership, commercial integration, and brand storytelling continuing to accelerate. Over eight seasons, ABB has moved from brand visibility to brand activation—integrating deeply into the fan experience, the sport’s ecosystem, and our innovation narrative.Also Read: Antonio Felix Da Costa shares happy memories as Porsche wins Formula E Teams and Manufacturers’ World Championships “This next chapter elevates the partnership even further. With ABB’s new positioning, we are co-creating opportunities across content, digital storytelling, and market engagement, transforming a title partnership into a year-round, value-generating relationship. It’s a model of how modern sponsorships should evolve, rooted in purpose and cultural alignment but measured by impact,” she added.Formula E Season 12 will begin with testing in Valencia in October.","ABB and Formula E have announced that they will continue their partnership in the upcoming season.

Play at the Cincinnati Open was temporarily suspended on Monday due to a local power outage that affected both match operations and television broadcasts. The suspension occurred around 5pm local time when broadcast channels lost their court camera feeds, and matches had to be halted due to the inability to use electronic line calling systems, which are mandatory for ATP Tour events.The power outage impacted several ongoing matches, including Taylor Fritz's contest against Lorenzo Sonego and Benjamin Bonzi's match against Stefanos Tsitsipas. Multiple doubles matches were also in progress when the suspension was announced.The tournament officially addressed the situation through their social media channels, stating: ""Due to an on-site power outage, play is currently suspended.""Tennis pundit Gigi Salmon provided updates to Sky Sports viewers, explaining: ""Welcome back to the Cincinnati Open where unfortunately play is currently suspended. There is a local power outage which has meant a loss of pictures. The tennis did continue for a while. In that time, Taylor Fritz was able to complete that first set on a tiebreak against Lorenzo Sonego, and Benjamin Bonzi was able to come back from dropping the first set to Stefanos Tsitsipas, to move to 5-2 in the second [set] but a local power outage affects the electronic line calling. ""US broadcaster Tennis Channel also informed viewers through social media: ""Play in Cincinnati is currently suspended due to an onsite power outage.Stay tuned for updates on when the action resumes.""The suspension lasted approximately 90 minutes, with play resuming shortly after 6:30pm local time. It later appeared that the outage was due to a generator catching fire and impacting the power situation at the tournament in Mason.Before the power outage, several matches had been completed, including Emma Raducanu's three-hour and nine-minute battle against Aryna Sabalenka, which ended in a 7-6, 4-6, 7-6 defeat for the Briton.This incident marks the second time this season that a major ATP and WTA 1000 tournament has experienced power-related disruptions. A similar situation occurred at the Madrid Open in April, when a nationwide power cut in Spain forced the cancellation of all remaining matches for that day.Earlier in the day, before the power disruption, players including Anna Kalinskaya, Ekaterina Alexandrova, and Frances Tiafoe had successfully advanced to the last 16 of the tournament.","Play at the Cincinnati Open was temporarily suspended on Monday due to a local power outage.

When the 10 franchises sit for the IPL mega auction in Riyadh in the last week of Nov, the event will revolve around most teams looking for a new captain. Indian wicket-keepers will also be in demand. Rishabh Pant Shreyas Iyer and KL Rahul are likely to dictate the course of the auction. Don’t be surprised to see Washington Sundar’s stocks rising.TOI takes a look at what each IPL team will be vying for in the auction...The biggest concern for the franchise is to find a definitive successor to MS Dhoni . Pant will obviously be the desired option but their remaining purse of Rs 55 cr could handicap them. Ishan Kishan could be an option if MI don’t use the right-to-match (RTM) card.With Pant leaving the franchise, DC will be looking for a captain who can match Pant’s brand value. The buzz is the franchise will go all out to bring back Shreyas Iyer, who had captained them to an IPL final in 2020.They have retained their captain Shubman Gill. They had worked with Wriddhiman Saha in the last three seasons. They may also eye Pant with a remaining purse Rs 69 cr.Having let go of their title-winning captain Iyer, they are also looking for a captain. KL Rahul and Jos Buttler could be their options with a purse of just Rs 51 cr left.They have Rs 69 cr left in the purse, with Nicholas Pooran getting Rs 21 cr as top retention. They are likely to go all out for Pant as captaincy and wicketkeeping option after releasing KL RahulThey spent heavily on retentions and have also announced Hardik Pandya as their captain. They are likely to use their sole RTM for Ishan Kishan.With Ricky Ponting taking charge as head coach, the franchise has let go of everyone except Shashank Singh and Prabhsimran Singh. With Rs 110 cr left in the purse, new head coach Ricky Ponting will be looking to build the entire squad around Pant. PBKS are likely to be the biggest competition for other franchises. They will look to use RTM for Arshdeep Singh.They have used up most of the purse to retain the core of the team. They will only look to buy support players for the likes of Sanju Samson, Riyan Parag, Yashashvi Jaiswal with a purse of Rs 41 cr left.With Rs 83 cr in the bank, they have the highest purse remaining after PBKS. Dinesh Karthik becoming the batting coach opens up a slot for a captain and Indian wicketkeeper. Indications are they may go for Pant, with Rahul as a backup option.Besides MI and RR, SRH is the only other team which looks sorted. They will also go for support players for Klassen, Cummins, Head, Abhishek Sharma and Nitish Reddy with Rs 45 cr left in the bank.","Rishabh Pant, Shreyas Iyer and KL Rahul are likely to dictate the course of the auction.

KOLKATA: An amount of Rs 11 cr will sound princely for a 22-year old who spends perhaps as much time in the sick bay as on the field. However, the Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) owners never had a doubt that they wanted to hold on to their express bowler Mayank Yadav at any cost.""The way you look at it, when a player is playing a match, is he able to contribute to a win?"" LSG co-owner Shashwat Goenka asked TOI while explaining the rationale behind naming the pacer as one of their five retentions. ""I think Mayank fits that bill perfectly. He has played in four games last season and picked up seven wickets. That itself shows the potential of the individual.""Mayank in fact, has been with LSG since 2022. He did not get to play that season and had to sit out in 2023 with a torn hamstring. He made his debut in 2024 and instantly caught the attention with his pace, consistently going over the 150kph mark.With 3/27 (against PBKS) and 3/14 (against RCB), Mayank became the first player in IPL history to be named Player of the Match in his first two matches.""If you look at other players with similar background, when they first started off they were injury-prone as well and they had to work on their fitness, if I can put it that way,"" Goenka went on. ""So that wasn't the deciding factor, it was about when he plays, what is the contribution he makes to the game and to LSG. That was the guiding principle behind keeping him.""IPL has been tough on bowlers, going by last season's scores. Goenka, however, isn't worried that their young pacers might wilt under pressure. ""These guys really know how not to be tossed around,"" the owner said, giving examples of Mayank and Mohsin Khan 's performance in the death overs.",Mayank Yadav is one of five IPL players to be retained by Lucknow Super Giants. The 22-year-old bowler has been with the franchise since 2022. Mayank is the first player in IPL history to be named Player of the Match in two matches.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114867425,imgsize-31484,width-400,resizemode-4/114867425.jpg"

#INDvsNZ 3rd Test | India’s Madness After Jadeja Gives WTC Hope

MUMBAI: This was no brain fade. It was a brain explosion. In eight balls, Team India treated its fans to a horror show just a day after Halloween. With just around 10 minutes to go before stumps, Yashasvi Jaiswal , looking his free-flowing self while having scored 30 (52b, 4x4) in a 53-run second wicket partnership off 64 balls with Shubman Gill (31 batting, 38b, 2x4, 1x6), chose to reverse sweep an Ajaz Patel ball that had pitched on the leg stump. The ball crashed into his leg and middle stump. 78 for one in 17. 2 overs suddenly became 78 for two.If that wasn’t silly enough, India, instead of sending one of their three allrounders, asked tailender Mohammed Siraj to do the job of a nightwatchman. He was out LBW for a golden duck to Patel, giving the Kiwi left-arm spinner the chance to bag a hattrick. Then, Siraj burnt a review too, despite being plumb in front. 78 for three in 17.3.The worst was to come. Even as Virat Kohli staved off the hat-trick, he played his part in India’s final implosion in that little period under lights, which marred India’s Day One outing against New Zealand in the third and final Test at the Wankhede completely. Driving a ball to mid-on, Kohli (4) took off for a non-existent single as Matt Henry fired a direct throw to the stumps. 84 for four in 18.3 overs.This is the second time in two innings that Kohli has been involved in a needless runout. In India’s second dig in Pune, his eagerness for a quick single at backward point had led to Rishabh Pant being out for a duck. His keenness to get off the strike on Friday indicated that Kohli is not just short of runs, but short of self-confidence too.Within a space of six runs and seven balls, India, suffering their latest collapse, lost three wickets. Their dressing room looked stunned with head coach Gautam Gambhir looking on in disbelief.Before this phase of thoughtless cricket, skipper Rohit Sharma (18; 18b, 3x4), playing a Test at the Wankhede after 11 years, served up yet another evidence of why he could be well past his best, getting squared up while trying to halfpull a Henry delivery, only to be pouched by his counterpart Tom Latham at second slip.In five innings in this series, all the 37-year-old has put together is 80 runs, with just one half-century. Even here, he was lucky to survive after being dropped on 15 at long leg by William O’Rourke off Henry.In Nov 2013, Rohit had announced his arrival on the Test stage with a sizzling century at this venue in Sachin Tendulkar’s farewell Test. Could this outing be the last innings, at least at the Wankhede, if not at home, for him and a few other stalwarts of India’s golden generation?The collapse from 78-1 to 86-4 completely undid the fine work of their spinners Ravindra Jadeja (5/65) and Washington Sundar (4/81 in 18.4 overs). Both thrived on a pitch which provided generous turn and bounce on Day One after seamer Akash Deep had trapped opener Devon Conway LBW as the Kiwis folded for 235.If the visitors got 15-20 runs above par on this pitch, where playing spin isn’t easy, they must be grateful for the excellent half-centuries by Daryl Mitchell (82; 129b, 3x4, 3x6) and Will Young (71; 138b, 4x4, 2x6). While Mitchell must be complimented for the way he kept at it despite constantly battling cramps because of the oppressive heat and humidity of Mumbai, Young deserves praise for the way he has filled the big shoes of Kiwi batting great Kane Williamson at the pivotal No. 3 spot. Both used their feet and swept well to neutralise the spinners.Brushing off unusual poor form at home, Jadeja took his 14th five-wicket haul, while the impressive Sundar, carrying on from his magical 14-wicket haul in the last Test in Pune, again overshadowed his senior off-spinning colleague R Ashwin.Just one wicket would’ve put Ashwin past Indian leg-spin great Anil Kumble’s record haul of 38 wickets at the Wankhede, but the 38-year-old finished wicketless, a pale shadow of his former self.","India lose 3/6 in 8 balls in final 15 minutes to end Day 1 at 86/4 in reply to NZ’s 235.

CHENNAI: It's a new start but Chennai Super Kings have decided to stick with their tried-and-tested formula of continuity as they retained Ruturaj Gaikwad , Ravindra Jadeja, Shivam Dube, Matheesha Pathirana and MS Dhoni (uncapped).Now, CSK are left with Rs 55 cr in the kitty and there are talks that they would like Rishabh Pant in their squad.

The 38-year-old was part of CSK until 2015 before he moved on.

Ruben Amorim revealed Friday that he was told by Manchester United ""it was now or never"" after being handed a brief midway through the season to restore the struggling Premier League giants to the pinnacle of English and European football.The 39-year-old Sporting Lisbon coach quickly emerged as the hot favourite for the Old Trafford job after Erik ten Hag was sacked on Monday following a terrible start to the season. Amorim has signed a deal until 2027 and will join the club on November 11, becoming the sixth permanent manager since Alex Ferguson retired in 2013.Amorim admitted in his first news conference since being given the job that he had endured a whirlwind few days.""The only question I made was to go at the end of the season,"" Amorim said.""But I was told it was now or never. I had three days to make the decision. That's what I did.""If I rejected it now, in six months I would not have got it. I didn't want to regret making this decision.""Amorim added that he had been approached by other clubs, one of which had offered him ""three times"" the windfall he would enjoy at United.United described Amorim as ""one of the most exciting and highly rated young coaches in European football"".""Highly decorated as both a player and coach, his titles include winning the Primeira Liga twice in Portugal with Sporting CP — the first of which was the club's first title in 19 years,"" a club statement said.Ruud van Nistelrooy will remain in temporary charge until Amorim arrives at Old Trafford .The Portuguese coach will oversee Sporting's remaining matches before the international break, which started with a 5-1 rout of Estrela on Friday, the club's 10th win in 10 league games this season.Sporting host Manchester City in the Champions League next Tuesday and Amorim's final game in charge is set to be against former club Braga in the league on November 10.He will take charge of United for the first time on November 24, away at relegation-threatened Ipswich.Sporting said in a statement United would pay the Portuguese club 11 million euros ($12 million) over Amorim's departure.United sacked Ten Hag on Monday after a 2-1 defeat by West Ham left them languishing 14th in the Premier League, with just three wins from nine matches despite a huge financial outlay.The three-time European champions are 21st out of 36 teams in the revamped Europa League after three draws in their three matches so far this season.Prior to Wednesday's 5-2 win against Leicester in the fourth round of the League Cup, United had won just one of their past eight games in all competitions.Ten Hag won the League Cup and FA Cup during his two full seasons at Old Trafford but the club have not won the Premier League since 2013.Ferguson won the Premier League title 13 times during a stay of nearly 27 years but the 20-time English champions have not mounted a sustained title challenge since.Former United striker Van Nistelrooy said Thursday he was ""motivated"" to help turn United's season around and wants to stay at the club as he prepares the players for a high-profile match against Chelsea on Sunday.Amorim, a former Portugal midfielder, started his managerial career with then third-tier Casa Pia in 2018 before a switch to Braga.Sporting swooped in 2020 and he won the club's first league title in 19 years in his first full season in charge, repeating the feat last season.Seen as one of the rising stars on the European coaching scene, he was linked with the manager's role at Liverpool once Jurgen Klopp announced he was leaving but Dutch coach Arne Slot headed to Anfield instead.Amorim held talks with West Ham this year before they appointed former Spain coach Julen Lopetegui to replace David Moyes.Former United defender Rio Ferdinand said Amorim has the ""character and the charisma"" that Ten Hag lacked.Ten Hag meanwhile thanked United fans Friday night saying ""my dream was to bring more trophies to the cabinet"".""Unfortunately, that dream has come to an end,"" he said in a statement.""I wish all Manchester United fans nothing but success, trophies and glory. Your support and the warmth I received from everyone at the club helped me feel at home. Thank you for this chapter in my life.

#INDvsNZ 3rd Test | India’s Madness After Jadeja Gives WTC Hope

MUMBAI: Whenever New Zealand have pinned India down in this series, they have made sure to capitalize on the advantage. After India collapsed from 78/1 to 86/4, the stunned faces in the Indian dressing room, and in the stands, summed up the day.Daryl Mitchell, who top scored for the Black Caps with a fine 82, felt the team's collective effort and ability to hang on when the chips were down — read when Yashasvi Jaiswal and Shubman Gill were piling on the runs — ensured that they ended the day with their noses ahead.""That's the nature of Test cricket . There's always ebbs and flows throughout the day and we were lucky today to build some pressure. There was a nice partnership going between Shubman and Jaiswal. But as it happens in Tests, you get one, you try and get two and you keep trying to put the pressure on the opposition. Hopefully, we can take a few more in the morning but we also know that they've got a number of world-class players,"" Mitchell said.He went on to laud the effort put in by each player even during the fag end of the day, whether it was Rachin Ravindra running around to save runs or Matt Henry 's effort that caught Virat Kohli short of his crease. ""Our motto is to just keep giving to the team. The way Rachin and some of the other guys chased the ball right to the boundary, that's the stuff that we pride ourselves on. It means everyone's engaged. It's nice that it paid off tonight.""We put a total on the board (and) hopefully now we can take a few more wickets. The game is evenly poised right at the moment,"" Mitchell said, adding that the conditions did not surprise the Kiwis. ""It's the nature of the red soil. It's going to have bounce and a little bit of turn. We knew what to expect,"" he said.","Daryl Mitchell top scored for the Black Caps with a fine 82.

NEW DELHI: Despite India's consecutive Test losses against New Zealand, visiting captain Tom Latham maintains that the Indian squad remains formidable without any significant weaknesses.New Zealand achieved a remarkable milestone by securing their first Test series victory in India, winning the opening match in Bengaluru by eight wickets and following it up with a decisive 113-run victory in Pune.While India faces comprehensive challenges across all departments in the current series, the New Zealand team, which has performed flawlessly throughout their tour, offered encouraging remarks about their opponents.""India are a quality side, things obviously haven't gone the way they wanted over the last couple of weeks but it doesn't make them a bad team overnight,"" Latham told reporters before New Zealand's training session at the Wankhede Stadium .""They've got superstars from (Nos) 1 to 15 in their squad and we expect them to be in their best tomorrow and again a new challenge for both teams, a new surface.""""I'm sure a surface that they know well and a ground that they know well, so I certainly don't think they have any chinks - they're a quality team and it's going to be another great battle,"" Latham added.With New Zealand leading 2-0, a clean sweep over India is possible, though Latham remained reserved about that prospect.""We've obviously done a lot of good stuff over the last couple of weeks but for us, every Test match you go (in with) the focus of trying to win key moments and not necessarily focusing on the result...""Obviously that's the byproduct of putting things together back-to-back, good sessions back-to-back so yeah, a different pitch, different conditions, it's obviously a lot hotter out there than what we've faced in the last couple of weeks,"" he said.Latham, who assumed New Zealand’s captaincy before this tour, expressed satisfaction with his team’s two wins, which have bolstered the inaugural World Test Champions’ hopes of reaching another final.Prior to this tour, New Zealand’s chances of a second WTC final appearance were slim, but they now need to secure victories in all four remaining Tests to stay in the race. Besides the upcoming third Test against India, New Zealand will face England in a three-Test home series.But once again, Latham opted to downplay the significance of their achievement and said, ""The beauty of this team is we're a reasonably levelled team in terms of I guess when results don't go so well but also when you know results do go well.""We try to keep things as level as we can and there's no bigger carrot in terms of what's coming up, if you know, if we are successful throughout this game.""We always focus on the process around what that looks like from the start of the game and adapt throughout the game in terms of the game situation and what will be needed,"" he said.Latham stated that New Zealand's focus remains on the task ahead, rather than celebrating being the first Kiwi team in nearly 70 years to defeat India on their home soil.""The guys celebrated what was you know a fantastic last week and came here yesterday. We're a bit shocked by the heat, it was pretty hot out there, but yeah, again, another challenge and you know we'll certainly be looking forward to what's presented to us this week,"" he said.When asked whether overseas Test and series victories should hold more weight in the WTC points system, Latham expressed his contentment with the current setup.""I haven't necessarily thought about that as such. The introduction of the World Test Championship over the last five (to) six years has been fantastic and the context that it has put on Test cricket , rather than bilateral series, has been fantastic,"" he said.""We've probably seen a few more results in terms of games that have been played certainly over the last period of time, so the context that's now given Test cricket is awesome.""Being in the position with the first one (winning team) and being successful gives you a taste of what that success feels like and once you do it, you want to do it again,"" he added.",New Zealand captain Tom Latham says India's recent results don't make them a bad team.

NEW DELHI: With just two uncapped players retained and the biggest purse of Rs 110.5 crore going into the mega auction, Punjab Kings will be starting from scratch under new head coach Ricky Ponting.Prabhsimran Singh and Shashank Singh were the only two retained players by the franchise as the side made a bold move of releasing the likes of Arshdeep Singh, Kagiso Rabada and Sam Curran.With Punjab having failed to make it to the playoffs since 2014, the Australian great sees this as an opportunity to start afresh and wants the franchise to play a completely new brand of cricket.Shedding light on retention decisions, Ponting said that he wants the team to be the most dynamic and entertaining team going forward.""I’m most excited about a new, fresh start. It starts to come together today, with the retention list. It’s well documented as to what I’ve done with Punjab (Kings). We’re only going in with two uncapped players and we’re going into the auction with the biggest purse by a long way. So, we’ve got the ability to put a whole squad of players together.,"" Ponting said on The ICC Review.""A couple of new coaching staff come in as well (for Punjab Kings). The main and most important thing for me is making this whole franchise different. Making it different from outside, making the results on-field look different.""I want us to be the most dynamic and most entertaining franchise and group of players in the IPL,"" Ponting said.As the retention deadline ended on October 31, Ponting expressed surprise on Rishabh Pant, Shreyas Iyer and KL Rahul's release by their respective teams.“There are a lot of exciting players. So many. I’m a bit surprised with some of the non-Indian retentions if you like, with both Shreyas Iyer and Rishabh Pant being available in the auctions,” Ponting said.“It was a bit surprising, even KL Rahul to a certain degree. It seems like individuals or franchises are busy looking to move in different directions to some of their players.“This is where it gets exciting,” Ponting said. “You’ve got to understand who your number one target is and how much money you are willing to pay for them. That’s such a big part of it (IPL), of getting the auction right strategy-wise. And then handing it over to us, as a group of coaches,” he added.Ahead of the auction, Royal Challengers Bengaluru have the second biggest purse -- Rs 83 crore -- after Punjab.: Ruturaj Gaikwad, Matheesha Pathirana, Shivam Dube, Ravindra Jadeja, MS Dhoni: Axar Patel, Kuldeep Yadav, Tristan Stubbs, Abhishek Porel: Rashid Khan, Shubman Gill, Sai Sudharsan, Rahul Tewatia, Shahrukh Khan: Rinku Singh, Varun Chakaravarthy, Sunil Narine, Andre Russell, Harshit Rana, Ramandeep Singh: Nicholas Pooran, Ravi Bishnoi, Mayank Yadav, Mohsin Khan, Ayush Badoni: Jasprit Bumrah, Suryakumar Yadav, Hardik Pandya, Rohit Sharma, Tilak Varma: Shashank Singh, Prabhsimran Singh: Sanju Samson, Yashasvi Jaiswal, Riyan Parag, Dhruv Jurel, Shimron Hetmyer, Sandeep Sharma: Virat Kohli, Rajat Patidar, Yash Dayal: Pat Cummins, Abhishek Sharma, Nitish Kumar Reddy, Heinrich Klaasen, Travis Head","Punjab Kings have the biggest purse of Rs 110.5 crore going into the mega auction.

NEW DELHI: New Zealand 's Daryl Mitchell expressed that the game remained balanced, even though India's batting collapse had shifted momentum towards Kiwis on day one of the third and final Test in Mumbai.After winning the toss, New Zealand managed to score 235, with Mitchell contributing a significant 82 runs. India's bowling performance effectively restricted the visitors, but their batting response proved problematic.At stumps, India found themselves in a difficult situation at 86 for four, still needing 149 runs to match New Zealand's first innings total.""We put a total on the board (and) hopefully now we can take a few more wickets. We'll see what happens tomorrow (day two). The game is evenly poised right at the moment,"" said Mitchell after the end of day's play.Indian spinners Ravindra Jadeja (5/65) and Washington Sundar (4/81) dominated the first day, claiming nine wickets between them as the pitch offered significant assistance to spin.Mitchell noted that the conditions came as no surprise to the visiting team.""It's the nature of red soil here in this part of the world. It's going to have a bit of bounce and a little bit of turn. We knew what we were expecting when we showed up this morning,"" he said.Mitchell expressed pride in New Zealand's performance as the team inched closer to a historic 3-0 series win over India, aiming to become the first visiting side to achieve this feat.""It was pretty warm out there. The humidity was pretty sticky and there wasn't a lot of breeze. Us Kiwis, coming from down in the middle of winter back home, it's always a good challenge,"" he said.""We're just a bunch of Kiwis taking on the world, having fun and trying to win games for our country.

NEW DELHI: Former Indian captain Anil Kumble didn’t hold back while commenting on Virat Kohli 's run-out on Day 1 of the third Test against New Zealand , describing the dismissal as 'suicidal'.India, who ended the day at 86/4 in reply to NZ's 235, will begin Day 2 with Shubman Gill (31*) and Rishabh Pant (1*) at the crease as the hosts work to close the 149-run deficit.On Team India's sudden collapse late in the day, Kumble said it's more than a concern at the moment.""You can't have this repeatedly happening in every game, so it's more than a concern at the moment. You had an opportunity to get inside with just one wicket down of Rohit Sharma . And then yes, Jaiswal gets out and the night watchman comes in and gets out first ball, then this (Kohli run-out),"" said Kumble, while talking on Jio Cinema, after the end of day's play.Kumble pointed out that Kohli’s aggressive instincts may have led to a risky single that ultimately cost India a crucial wicket. He emphasized that such moments can disrupt the team’s momentum, especially when an experienced batter like Kohli is dismissed unnecessarily.""Nobody expected the run-out. This was certainly not something that you expect of Virat Kohli getting run out in the last over or last few minutes of a day's play. And it was something that he just hit the shot and then went straight for a run, which is suicidal,"" the former cricketer added.In 2024, Virat Kohli has accumulated 249 runs across six Tests and ten innings so far, with just one fifty and a highest score of 70.However, in the ongoing ICC World Test Championship 2023-25, Kohli's performance has been more consistent. He has scored 560 runs in nine Tests, including a century and three fifties across 15 innings, with a best score of 121.",Anil Kumble describes Virat Kohli's run-out on Day 1 of third Test as'suicidal' India ended the day at 86/4 in reply to New Zealand's 235.

NEW DELHI: As India suffered yet another collapse -- losing three wickets in 8 balls -- this time, during the closing stages of play on the opening day of the third Test, all-rounder Ravindra Jadeja admitted that things happened all of a sudden and the team did not have time to react.The hosts were cruising at 78 for one in reply to New Zealand's 235 all out but a shock batting display saw them losing three batters in final two overs and end the day at a precarious 86 for four.The four dismissals of Rohit Sharma (18), Yashasvi Jaiswal (30), Mohammed Siraj (0) and Virat Kohli (4) have now left the team in a difficult spot but Jadeja said that the team is not yet out of the match.Jadeja also said that it is unfair to blame specific individuals for the brief period of poor performance.""It all unfolded in a mere 10 minutes, (we) did not get any time to react. But it happens, it is a team game, any individual cannot be blamed specifically… small mistakes keep happening,"" Jadeja told the media after end of play.""But the next batters will have to forge partnerships and try and get past (the score of) 230 (235), only then the second innings will come into play. It will be good if the batters who are lined up to play next make their contributions.""""We still have a chance. It is not the case that we are out of the match. Hopefully, we would bat well tomorrow and given that there is something happening on the wicket, if we also bowl well, then it will be good,"" he added.With India facing yet another collapse, Jadeja disputed the idea that the repetitive failure of specialist batters has put a lot of pressure on the lower order.""Pressure is always there. It is not that when the top-order does not perform, the pressure is always there on the lower order. When the top-order does perform, even then there is pressure on the lower-order as to why they are not doing it?"" he replied.Jaiswal was bowled while attempting a reverse slog sweep off Ajaz Patel. The left-arm spinner then trapped nightwatchman Mohammed Siraj leg-before with the very next delivery.At No 5, Kohli attempted a risky single only to be run out, causing India to suffer another poor session and lose their advantage to New Zealand.Jadeja acknowledged that India's poor performances in the first innings across the three Tests against New Zealand have been crucial to their struggles.""Sometimes, when you are down 0-2, it takes time for you to do anything, or even to bounce back. We have not done enough in the first innings from the first Test and have been behind in the game,"" he said.""Even in Pune, we did not bat well and repeated the same mistakes and have been lagging behind.""Jadeja admitted that he never imagined losing a Test series at home while he was playing, emphasizing the high expectations set by the Indian team.""Firstly, I had this fear… personally I had thought that I won't lose a series in India as long as I am playing. But that too has happened,"" he said.""We won 18 series (at home), I thought as long as I am playing Test cricket in India we won't lose a series but that has happened, so I am not surprised with anything (that is happening).""He continued, ""We have set the expectations really high.

Soon after hitting it, Kohli took off but Matt Henry was quick to react and threw the ball down at the stumps after swiftly collecting it.Seeing the incoming throw, Kohli put in a big dive but as Henry had hit the bull's eye, the star India batter was found at least a couple of yards short.Before the fall of Kohli in the final over, the penultimate over of the day saw India losing Yashasvi Jaiswal and nightwatchman Mohammed Siraj falling of successive balls against Ajaz Patel.While Jaiswal (30) was knocked over around his legs, Siraj was trapped plumb in front of the stumps for a golden duck.Earlier, Ravindra Jadeja and Washington Sundar shared 9 wickets between them as the hosts bundled out the Kiwis for 235.Daryl Mitchell (82) was the top scorer for the BlackCaps.New Zealand already have an unassailable 2-0 lead in the three-match Test series.",Virat Kohli run-out with India 86 for four on opening day of third and final Test against New Zealand.

Three days after snapping their nine-match winless run across competitions, East Bengal FC are gearing up for another key hurdle to cross when they take on Lebanon's Nejmeh FC in their final Group A match of the AFC Challenge League in Thimphu on Friday.At stake for Oscar Bruzon's team is not only a place in quarterfinals of the remodeled third tier of men's AFC club competitions, but a much-required confidence-booster before resuming action in the Indian Super League East Bengal are second in the group with 4 points, 2 points behind a perfect Nejmeh.Eight teams will progress to the quarterfinals from the group stage — the three group winners and best-ranked runners-up from the West, and the top two finishers of each group from the East.Should East Bengal finish second, they will still have a chance to advance, but their fate may depend on the day's second match between hosts Paro FC (1 point) and already-eliminated Bashundhara Kings (0 point).East Bengal's talk of resurgence has gathered steam from their 4-0 demolition of Bashundhara on Tuesday, the team's first win in 10 matches in the season.

'One of the best'

Alexander Zverev beat fierce rival Stefanos Tsitsipas in the quarter-finals of the Paris Masters on Friday, while Holger Rune edged Alex de Minaur to keep alive his hopes of reaching the ATP Tour Finals .Zverev's 7-5, 6-4 win over Tsitsipas kept him in the running to claim his first title in Paris after losing to Daniil Medvedev in the 2020 championship match.World number three Zverev -- the highest-ranked player left in the draw -- will face 2022 champion Rune in Saturday's semi-final after the Dane overcame De Minaur 6-4, 4-6, 7-5.The 16th meeting between the 27-year-old German and 26-year-old Greek was evenly matched during a hard-fought first set.""At the beginning, he was outplaying me but then I found my rhythm from the baseline,"" said Zverev on court.""And when I had my chance I used it in the first set.""Indeed once Zverev broke late in the opener and early in the second, it became a comfortable ride to just his sixth win against his long-time Greek rival.The loss ends the chances of the world number 11 Tsitsipas of reaching the end-of-year ATP Finals -- having won the showpiece event in 2019.Tsitsipas and Zverev started cautiously with both offering up opportunities for early breaks in their first service games.But they soon found their range as the first set looked destined to require a tie-break to separate the pair on the quick surface at Paris' Bercy Arena.However, the first break points of the match eventually came with Tsitsipas serving at 5-5, the German claiming the second on a double fault.The Greek saved two set points and secured a break-back point of his own but Zverev dug in to hold.Tsitsipas' shoulders visibly sagged as he offered up break point after break point at 1-1 in the second set.When he dragged a shot long to end a game which had lasted over 15 minutes, his opponent had firmly taken the ascendancy.Zverev, who reached the French Open final in Paris this year, served out to win and move towards a second ATP 1000-level trophy of the season.Former world number four Rune, the 13th seed, needed just one break of serve as he took the opener against De Minaur.In the second set, the 25-year-old Australian started to open up on his groundstrokes, producing several stunning winners off both wings.Rune finally relented when serving at 4-5, offering up three set points to De Minaur who duly converted the second with aplomb.The Australian's first serve gradually deserted him in the decider and Rune capitalised by breaking in the fifth game, but De Minaur struck immediately back to level.A huge net cord that clipped the line on the right side of the court for Rune gave him a 15-0 lead and he took full advantage, breaking to lead 6-5 before consolidating to win the match.""Sascha (Zverev) and I had a great match in Paris, where he took it in five. I beat him one time, he took me last time,"" Rune said of facing Zverev who came out on top when the pair met in a five-set clash in the last 16 of the French Open this year.""He is one of the best players this year, so I will have to be very well prepared.""With the result, both Rune and De Minaur still have a chance of reaching the Tour Finals in Turin, which run November 10-17.Frenchman Ugo Humbert , who downed world number two Carlos Alcaraz in the last 16, delighted the vocal home crowd by beating unseeded Australian Jordan Thompson 6-2, 7-6 (7/4).The world number 18 will face Russian Karen Khachanov in the other semi-final as he attempts to reach a first Masters final of his career and emulate Jo-Wilfried Tsonga in becoming the first French winner in Paris since 2008.Khachanov, the 2018 Paris Masters champion, defeated last year's runner-up Grigor Dimitrov 6-2, 6-3, ending the 33-year-old Bulgarian's hopes of reaching Turin in the process.","Alexander Zverev beats Stefanos Tsitsipas 7-5, 6-4 in Paris Masters quarter- final.

You need to get to a situation for luck to play a role: Arjun Kadhe,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/top-stories/you-need-to-get-to-a-situation-for-luck-to-play-a-role-arjun-kadhe/articleshow/114661630.cms,"Arjun Kadhe

PUNE: It was his grandparents who sowed the seeds for Arjun Kadhe ’s career as a professional tennis player.More than two decades ago, when Arjun was taking baby steps in tennis, his paternal grandfather decided to sell their house and set aside the proceeds exclusively to help his grandson follow a dream.“I remember when I was eight years old … at that point we were not financially so super to think about tennis as a viable option for my career. But my granddad had a vision. He told me, ‘Okay, I will do anything. You just play tennis, you want to represent India, you want to play a Grand Slam ’. My parents were living on rent. It was unbelievable,” an emotional Kadhe, 30, said as he jogged his memory back.All the sacrifices, of his and of those around him, and the years of tireless pursuit of excellence bore fruit last week when Arjun claimed his first ATP Tour doubles title , in partnership with Rithvik Choudary at the Almaty Open in Kazakhstan last week.“The credit goes first to my parents, they've made huge sacrifices, then my coaches. Obviously, it's a team effort,” he said.""Obviously, Balu sir (coach M Balachandran) traveling with us, (former South African player) Raven (Klaasen) traveling with us, the Double Dream of India programme is helping us a lot.“And as you said, the journey is long, but it feels really, really good, because you get rewarded. In doubles you're playing 35 weeks alone on the road, and it can be really brutal sometimes.“So this win, we both want to take it in, get confidence, enjoy and go ahead again.”The Indian combination beat three teams ranked in the top-30 on the ATP Tour, including No. 13 pair Sadio Doumbia and Fabien Reboul of France in the second round.In a thriller of a final, Arjun and Rithvik saved five match points in the super tiebreak to beat Germany’s Jakob Schnaitter and Mark Wallner, ranked 26th, 3-6, 7-6 (3), 14-12. Remarkably, the Indians won only 68 points to their rivals’ 80 in the match.Arjun acknowledged that luck played its part in their win, but the team needed to work hard to get there in the first place.“I think luck played a big part. But at the same time, we were just talking, the coaches were telling us we lost two finals in the super tiebreak, where we were the better team, in the Challengers. As (personal coach) Hemant (Bendrey) sir was also saying, luck is there, but you have to get yourself into that situation for luck to play it out,” Arjun said.The Punekar, supported by Punit Balan group , rose to a career-high 77 in the individual doubles ranking after the win.“I'm really grateful that it has happened, but at the same time, I feel I was playing a good level,” he said.“It's about, you know, being there, giving yourself that chance, getting rejected, at some point it will come.“It's not in your hands when that click comes. For some people, it comes early. If they can sustain it, they move to the next level.“Some people get rejected, and get that breakthrough. It's about working hard and trying to improve, and take the next step. Everyone has their own journey, in my opinion.“I feel we deserve it, because I truly believe we have the level. Now it's about going the long way and trying to improve every day and not be satisfied with this one tournament.”Arjun had partnered Rithvik in the latter half of last season but parted ways at the start of 2024. Even before they combined, the Telangana lad had mentioned to Arjun of his desire to play with his previous partner Niki Poonacha whenever he decided to focus on doubles. So, the Maharashtra player was understandably cautious when Rithvik reached out to him in the middle of this season.“I feel like every challenge brings opportunity. At that point (when Rithvik chose to go back to Niki at the start of 2024), I was like, ‘oh my God. we are doing well, blah, blah, blah, what is happening?’ But then, if I look back now, I won (two Challenger) titles (with Jeevan Nedunchezhiyan and Anirudh Chandrasekar),” Arjun said.“So it was really good for me.”This time around, Arjun said, the two were in for the long haul. And long-term partnership is something he strongly believes in.“To develop a good team, you need time,” he said, “because if you keep switching partners, the first few weeks of understanding how we want to play, understanding how my partner wants us to play in the future, what is our best?“For all that to align it takes a little bit of time, and in doubles you have super tiebreak. Sometimes you are winning from (facing) match points, sometimes losing from match points.”The Almaty title had given a pleasant surprise for both Arjun and Rithvik in terms of ranking jump — the latter had broken into the top-100 for the first time in his career, reaching 85 in the ATP charts.That means they will now give it a shot to make the Australian Open cut before closing the season.“Now it's about planning it smartly, taking care of your body, because it's the end of the year, you don't want to overplay,” he said.“If we want to be top-50 in the world, we need to improve a lot. We won this tournament, but those teams are doing so many things better than us. So, it’s important also to play the big events, lose, and then realize this is where we are at.“So, we are not thinking too far ahead, just trying to think next week. How can we try and make Australia? If we don't make it, we still have to try and make French.“The plan will go forward from there.”","Arjun Kadhe claims his first ATP Tour doubles title with Rithvik Choudary at Almaty Open in Kazakhstan. The 30-year-old rose to a career-high 77 in the individual doubles ranking after the win. Arjun acknowledged that luck played its part in their win, but the team needed to work hard.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114661721,imgsize-157286,width-400,resizemode-4/114661721.jpg"

Mentally, I stayed strong and I relied on my fitness to win this title.""Tanisha, world ranked 868, overcame Akanksha Nitture 6-7 (5), 6-1, 6-1 in the final of the hard court event.The triumph was made all the more memorable by the difficult start to the season wherein she was rendered out of action for three months after undergoing a ""mini surgery"" to treat a meniscus and ACL tear.Tanisha suffered the injury during an event in Monastir, Tunisia, in early April. She was leading in the second set against Finland'sAnastasia Kulikova , a former top-200 player with nine pro titles, when she felt pain but played through it. It was only the following day when she underwent scan, she discovered the full extent of the injury.""I cannot disclose what treatment I got, because I was treated by (Daniil) Medvedev's doctor … (I was) set back for three to four weeks,"" she said.""I was completely off from tennis. I was on crutches. I didn't play for three-four (sic) months. I was just building back my fitness and building the strength of my knee and everything.""So I would say this year has been tough, mentally, physically, and I had to face a lot adversities in the beginning because it was not looking that great.""But through it all, I stayed positive and didn't lose sight of my goal. I worked hard each and every day to build myself back up from injury … to get to where I'm right now, to lift my first pro title.""The time away from action and the subsequent comeback helped her understand her game better.""When I did start, it was also very tough, because when you start to play tournaments, you're trying to figure it out again because there's some pain or there's a certain movement that's bothering you.""So you have to find out, you have to go back and do therapy. It was a process to figure it out and to also strengthen my quads back up to support my knee. So, it was tough.""But, sometimes when there's a lot of chaos, when you have a lot of time, you can really think about tennis from an outside perspective, and you get to know yourself better.""Tunisia seems to be Tanisha's favourite hunting ground, at least this year, and it was for a reason.""The best probable reason why I frequently played in Monastir (is) because I've been boarding in All In Tennis Academy (in France), and it's very close,"" she said.""It's not that expensive to travel, not much of jet lag. And the level of the tournaments in Monastir are way, way, much higher than other places.""And I was still fresh off an injury. If you're injured and suddenly go to Thailand, what do you do? You go to Indonesia, you spend all that money for two weeks and you might not perform well.""It was in Monastir while she was finding her way back in July that she first felt a catch in the neck, which forced her to retire from a $15K event in the second round when she was leading 6-2, 4-1 against Spaniard Victoria Gomez O'Hayon.It was the same issue that cropped up in Bengaluru at the very start of the tournament, and she showed tremendous grit to play through the pain and obvious discomfort it put her in.""Right before my first round, in a certain movement, I jerked it, and I had the same neck catch again,"" she said.""I couldn't look up, I couldn't look to my right, I couldn't serve. And I think throughout this tournament, I had so many double faults. I'm sure the statistics are there.""It taught me something. I stayed strong, I battled each and every point. I ran for each and every shot. I didn't, you know, let anything go. So, that fighting spirit really helped me win this tournament.""And, of course, some strategy here and there, and to play smart tennis.""Smart tennis she did have to play in the final which lasted two hours and 19 minutes.""I knew that I had limited range of motion, and I knew that I couldn't blast my first serves, how I was blasting in Mysuru or before. So I knew that I had to tennis wise, play smart, and place the ball and start off the point and stay in the rallies for my match.""For sure, the neck started to act during the first set, which lasted more than an hour and a half. She delivered nine double faults in the opener, compared to just one for the remainder of the match.""When I was four or five down, my neck started to really catch again, and it was really extremely painful. So I had no other option to call the physio,"" Tanisha said.""The second and third, I took a breather. I just kind of meditated and focused on my game strategy … to place the balls away from her striking zone and to make her work for each and every point.And maybe she wasn't expecting, maybe she thought that I would be tired out and I wouldn't fight back. But I've always been a fighter, and I stayed strong mentally and just stayed in it, and I let her make the errors.""I was calm and cool. I can't explain it, but you know, I just went into my zone.""Tanisha has been mainly coached by her father Suresh Kalita. But she had worked with former Davis Cupper Vishaal Uppal and Billie Jean King Cup player Rushmi Chakravarthi among other coaches. She also had a short stint at the JC Ferrero Tennis Academy in Spain before heading to the Ohio State University to play college tennis.Having seen her share of tennis abroad, the Assam native believes that while the ""commitment level and fitness level"" were the areas where Indian players lagged, it was not necessary that they had to relocate to elsewhere to make the breakthrough.""We can definitely do that here as well. Like I said, it depends on the individual and how much they want to do it.""They might be doing the same exercises that the Europeans are doing, but it's not up to the standard that the Europeans are doing. In the sense, the effort, the physical ability, how much you are pushing yourself.""I've always believed that it's an individual's choice. And, there are some great tennis coaches, fitness coaches here. But in the end of the day, it's how hard you push yourself.""As for herself, Tanisha is not ready to rest on her Bengaluru laurels.""""This is just the beginning of something,"" she said, ""it's a good achievement, but I'm looking for more. I'm gonna get back to train and recover, to win some more, hopefully soon.""It's just one of the small stepping stones towards the bigger picture and the bigger goal.""","Tanisha Kashyap, 22, won the $15,000 ITF title in Bengaluru last week. It was her first pro title on the pro circuit. The triumph was made all the more memorable by the difficult start to the season.

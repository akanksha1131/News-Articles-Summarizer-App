Rohit Sharma: 'Virat Kohli is a modern day great. He will figure it out'

MELBOURNE: What must India do to take 20 wickets at the MCG? As skipper Rohit Sharma , head coach Gautam Gambhir and chief selector Ajit Agarkar were having a long discussion at the team's training session on Tuesday, Prasidh Krishna was seen wheeling away in the pace sets, as he has all through the series, bowling sharp and often troubling the frontline batters.Meanwhile, Nitish Kumar Reddy, who has contributed important cameos lower down the order but been unimpressive as a fourth medium-pacer, went through a long batting stint.India have some serious thinking to do about their combination ahead of the pivotal fourth Test. With the pitch here expected to assist the faster bowlers, should India play an additional pacer at the expense of the batting allrounder Reddy? Prasidh, remember, had a good game against Australia A at the same venue in early November, taking 4/50 in the first innings and 2/37 in the second.Or, with Ravindra Jadeja seemingly a certainty after his heroics with the bat in Brisbane, should Washington Sundar come in as second spinner in a holding role to provide relief to pace regulars Jasprit Bumrah Mohammed Siraj and Akash Deep?With some of their batting stalwarts in fading form and the new Kookaburra ball tending to dominate the bat in these conditions, taking a call on depleting the batting further - especially with Reddy in some form - could be a tricky call for the think-tank.Reddy's strike rate of 72.17 is the highest among Indian batters with 100-plus runs in this series. His seven sixes are the most on either side. He's taken the attack to the opposition even with his team in trouble, but bowled just 7 overs each in Perth and Adelaide across both innings and 13 overs in Brisbane.India are known to be cryptic about their lineup ahead of a game and Rohit spoke in riddles when asked about the combination. ""I had a look at the pitch and it has quite a bit of grass covering,"" he said. ""We're certainly considering the weather factor as well (a heat wave is predicted on Boxing Day). Whatever we have to do to make the best possible XI, we'll do that, whether it is playing an extra spinner or not. We'll see how much grass remains on the wicket, how much spinners will be used. This doesn't look like a dry wicket to me.""Should India go in unchanged instead? One pointer could be the recent past, and what the team has done in pace-friendly conditions in South Africa, England and Australia in recent times.India's win in the first Test of this series in Perth came when both Reddy and Sundar were played, but then a slot had opened up in Rohit's absence. The win against South Africa in Cape Town at the beginning of the year saw four frontline pacers in action in Bumrah, Siraj, Krishna and Mukesh Kumar, but that wasn't a tough call as conditions were conducive to extreme pace.Here, at the MCG, there could be long, attritional phases of the game when the seamers might tire out.India don't have an allrounder like Shardul Thakur, who was part of the bowling lineup in two memorable overseas wins in 2021, against South Africa in Centurion and England at the Oval, where he played a pivotal role with both bat and ball. The other big Test win that year, at Lord's, saw four frontline seamers in Bumrah, Ishant Sharma, Mohammed Shami and Siraj, apart from the lone spinner in Jadeja.India played both Jadeja and Ashwin in their last Test win at the MCG in 2020, turning the series around with an 8-wicket win after the 36-all-out debacle in the previous Test in Adelaide. That Jadeja and Ashwin could both bat were big plusses.Rohit was more forthright while addressing the unhealthy reliance on Bumrah, who has seemed in otherworldly form even as others like Siraj have not stepped up enough.""It's a challenge to handle not just the bowling but the entire team,"" he said. ""Nobody comes here not to perform. But when somebody is in form, we have to make the most of that. Bumrah is certainly making the most of it. Siraj and the others who are bowling around him know they need to step up. They're trying hard but have been a bit unlucky. Siraj has shown great attitude.""As for Bumrah, India's Atlas in this series, Rohit appeared as much in awe as the rest of the cricketing world. ""With him in this form, all that the other bowlers have to do is just maintain the pressure. He has crystal-clear ideas and keeps it simple. It makes it very easy for me as captain. It's nice to see that a lot of the opposition players talk about him. The impact he's had on the series is massive. Hopefully he'll continue to do that because these two games are very important for us.""It's in the cauldron of the MCG that the series may eventually be decided. One wrong move here and the campaign could stutter. Whether India go in unchanged, opt for another spinner or an extra pacer, it's Bumrah who will still work the magic. The think-tank merely has to make it easy for him with their choice of support cast.","India have some serious thinking to do about their combination ahead of the pivotal fourth Test.

Australia XI:

Australia's in-form batter and India's nemesis Travis Head passed a fitness test on Wednesday to retain his place in Australia's playing eleven, which the hosts announced on the eve of the Boxing Day Test in Melbourne .Announcing the eleven playing members for the match in Melbourne Cricket Ground beginning on Thursday, captain Pat Cummins confirmed the two expected changes.""Trav's good to go, he'll play,"" said the home team's captain . ""He just kicked off some final things today and yesterday. But no worries about injury with Trav. He'll go into the game fully fit.""Opener Sam Konstas will make his debut, replacing Nathan McSweeney, and pacer Scott Boland returned to the eleven for the injured Josh Hazlewood.Head suffered a quad strain during the third Test in Brisbane and his fitness was under a cloud, until he passed the fitness Test held on Thursday during the Christmas Day optional training session, which included various running drills.Cummins also revealed that Head, the leading run-scorer of this series so far, also had a short net session. However, the team might have to manage if he feels any discomfort while fielding during the match.""I don't think you'll see too much management of him throughout the game. He just kind of plays as is. Maybe around fielding, if he's a bit uncomfortable, we will (manage him), but he's fully fit,"" said Cummins.Head leads the batting charts by a mile, having scored 409 runs in his five innings so far at an average of 81.80, including two centuries. The second-placed batter in the list is India's KL Rahul with 235 runs in six innings.""It feels like the last 12 months, he's been in this unbelievable vein of form and he just keeps going on with it,"" said the Aussie pacer. ""He's hitting the ball really cleanly. You can see the pressure that he shifts back onto the opposition literally from the first ball that he walks out there.""I'm loving that he's in our team and I don't have to try to set a field and bowl to him. He's hitting the ball as well as I've ever seen anyone. So long may it continue.""With the Border Gavaskar Trophy and a place in the World Test Championship final at stake, the five-Test series is delicately placed at 1-1 after three matches. India won the first Test in Perth by 295 runs, and Australia came back to level things up with a 10-wicket victory in the pink-ball Test in Adelaide.The third Test at the Gabba in Brisbane ended in a draw.Usman Khawaja, Sam Konstas, Marnus Labuschagne, Steve Smith, Travis Head, Mitch Marsh, Alex Carey (wk), Pat Cummins (c), Mitchell Starc, Nathan Lyon, Scott Boland","Travis Head passes fitness test to retain place in Australia's XI for Boxing Day Test.

HARVINDER UNHAPPY AT THE SNUB

NEW DELHI: The sports ministry and double Olympic medallist Manu Bhaker struck a conciliatory note on Tuesday over the latter's surprise exclusion from the list of recommended athletes for this year's Major Dhyan Chand Khel Ratna award. The snub to the shooter created a huge controversy, leading to severe criticism of the 12-member selection committee.While Manu's father Ram Bhaker continued his tirade against the ministry and the committee for ignoring his daughter's credentials for the country's highest sporting honour with the shooter's personal coach Jaspal Rana, also joining the raging debate, the 22-year-old athlete caught in this storm broke her silence over the issue and admitted on Tuesday that there was a ""lapse"" on her part in filing the nomination.In what looks like an effort to end the controversy, Manu posted a statement on 'X' where she said that awards and recognitions keep her motivated but aren't her only goal. ""With regards to the ongoing issue for my nomination for the most prestigious Khel Ratna award, I would like to state that as an athlete my role is to play and perform for my country. I believe there has been a lapse, maybe on my part, while filing for the nomination which is being corrected,"" Manu wrote.""Awards and recognition keeps me motivated but are not my goal. Irrespective of the award, I shall remain motivated to win more medals for my country. It is a request to everyone, please do not speculate on this,"" she said.Manu had been applying for the Khel Ratna for the last three years - 2021-2023 - but her achievements weren't considered despite the shooter winning several medals at major multisport events. It's been learnt that Manu was unhappy with the snub meted out to her by different awards committees and this could be a reason for her not applying this time.Despite that, the selection panel should have taken cognizance of her achievements as a shooter over the years, including the two Paris Games medals. It's been learnt that the ministry is actively considering nominating her name for the Khel Ratna by using its executive powers vested in the provisions of theNational Sports Day awards scheme.Rana, who returned to coach Manu exactly a year before the Paris Olympics, held the ministry, Sports Authority of India (SAI) and National Rifle Association of India (NRAI) responsible for ignoring his ward's credentials. ""I will hold all of them responsible. Why should anyone even say Manu did not apply? Her name should have been there automatically. Don't the people at the helm know who Manu Bhaker is? This humiliation might just affect her progress,"" Rana was quoted as saying by a news agency.Indian archer Harvinder Singh , who made history at the Paris Paralympics by clinching a gold medal in the men's individual recurve open, has expressed his annoyance over the Khel Ratna snub. He became the first archer from the country to win gold in either the Paralympics or the Olympics and also achieved the distinction of being the only archer to secure medals in consecutive Paralympic editions. ""Discrimination in sports. Tokyo 2020 Paralympic gold medallists were awarded the Major Dhyan Chand Khel Ratna Award, but what about Paris 2024 Paralympic gold medallists? Same competition, same gold, same pride, why not the same award?"" he posted on X. In 2021, Tokyo Paralympics gold medallists Avani Lekhara Sumit Antil and Pramod Bhagat were all awarded the Khel Ratna.","Double Olympic medallist Manu Bhaker was snubbed from the list of recommended athletes for this year's Major Dhyan Chand Khel Ratna award.

Pat Cummins press conference: On poor form of India batters, pressure on Rohit Sharma and more

Former India coach and all-rounder Ravi Shastri believes that while Joe Root and Kane Williamson have stood out this year in Test cricket, the other two members of the 'Fab Four' -- Virat Kohli and Steve Smith -- remain ""dangerous because they are hungry"" as they haven't scored big consistently of late.""I think they (Kohli and Smith) would have slipped down the ranks on current form because...you've got the likes of Root taking off, there's Williamson doing well, Harry Brook has come onto the scene...There are a lot of other young players pushing, but these are class players,"" Shastri said on the recent episode of The ICC Review.England's Root has had a fabulous 2024, scoring 1556 runs in 17 matches at an average of 55.77, including six centuries. Former New Zealand captain Williamson, too, has scored over a thousand runs this year, with his tally standing at 1013 runs at an average of 59.58, including four centuries.""In a situation like this, you know they (Kohli and Smith) will be dangerous because they'll be hungry,"" reckoned Shastri.Both Kohli and Smith have shown signs of returning to form in the ongoing Border Gavaskar Trophy, where they have hit a hundred each. But their overall Test numbers this year are nowhere near Root and Williamson's.Kohli has scored 376 runs so far in 9 matches, averaging 25.06. Smith has made 337 runs in 8 matches at an average of 28.08.""What’s needed you saw from Smith. It might have been a struggle early on (during his century knock in Brisbane) but he was prepared to play the waiting game and be disciplined,"" said Shastri.""I think the same with Virat. If Virat gets over that first 30-40 minutes with serious application and discipline, I don’t think he's (out of form), none of these guys are out of form.""Kohli began the tour of Australia with a century (100 not out) in the second innings of the opening Test in Perth, which played a key role in India's 295-run victory. However, his other four knocks read 5, 7, 11, 3.Kohli and Smith will take guard in one more Test before the end of the year, when India and Australia meet in the Boxing Date Test at the Melbourne Cricket Ground.","Ravi Shastri believes Virat Kohli and Steve Smith would have slipped down the ranks on current form.

Australia Playing XI:

Australia announced their playing eleven on Christmas day for the fourth Test against India, beginning in Melbourne on Thursday, with two changes from the team that played in Brisbane.There's a sigh of relief in the camp as the in-form batter Travis Head passed his fitness test on Wednesday to retain his place, as confirmed by captain Pat Cummins who also revealed the two changes.Teenager Sam Konstas 's international debut, replacing opener Nathan McSweeney, has been officially confirmed, while Scott Boland will take the place of injured pacer Josh Hazlewood.Konstas, aged 19, is set to become the youngest Australian to make his Test debut since Cummins played his debut match against South Africa at Johannesburg in November 2011 as an 18-year-old.Konstas threw his hat in the ring with a century (107 off 97 balls) against the Indian team during the pink-ball warm-up match at the Manuka Oval in Canberra.""I just remember being really excited and it's similar for Sammy this week,"" said Cummins. ""There's a level of naivety that you just want to go out and play, like you do when you were a kid in the backyard; you just want to take the game on and have fun and not overthink.""That's the message to Sam. That's definitely how I felt as an 18-year-old. I was just really excited, and once the game started, you go into game-mode and it's just like any other game.""Cummins also expressed his relief to see Head passing the fitness test to stay in the eleven. The left-handed batter leads the series' scoring charts with 409 runs in five innings at an average of 81.80, including two centuries.""It feels like the last 12 months, he's been in this unbelievable vein of form and he just keeps going on with it,"" said the skipper.

Nineteen-year-old Sam Konstas is set to debut in the Boxing Day Test, becoming the 468th Australian men's Test cricketer. This will make him the youngest Australian Test debutant since Pat Cummins in 2011.Konstas's inclusion was confirmed by coach Andrew McDonald on Tuesday, ahead of the fourth Test between Australia and India. He will be the youngest player to wear the Baggy Green since an 18-year-old Cummins debuted in 2011.Konstas struck 107 from 97 balls against India three weeks ago in a practice match. India's attack in Canberra that day included Akash Deep, Mohammed Siraj and Ravindra Jadeja.The last time Konstas played at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, he made 73 not out for Australia A against India A.Konstas will become Australia’s youngest ever Test opener and fourth youngester debutant when he steps up to the MCG. But McDonald said he had the temperament to succeed.“He’s been very similar to what I’ve seen on the outside … he’s composed, relaxed,” McDonald said.“He’ll play Boxing Day, so I’ll get that one out of the way.“What he’s shown is an array of shots and an ability to put pressure back on his opponents.”However, Travis Head 's participation in the crucial Test against India is uncertain. He suffered a quad strain during the third Test at the Gabba.“He picked up a quad strain during the third Test at the Gabba.” said McDonald.McDonald expressed confidence in Head's recovery but acknowledged there were still fitness tests to be cleared. The coach remains hopeful Head will be fit to play.Head, who didn't train on Monday due to the issue, did get involved on Tuesday with a short stint in the nets when he received throw downs for about 20 minutes.Head had a lengthy chat with McDonald and team physio Nick Jones before returned to the dressing room.Other batters Steve Smith, Usman Khawaja and Marnus Labuschagne, meanwhile, had extended periods in the nets facing the likes of Mitchell Starc.Scott Boland is near-certain to replace Josh Hazlewood in the playing XI. This despite McDonald's prediction that the extreme heat expected on day one will make the MCG pitch less bowler-friendly than usual. McDonald anticipates a flatter surface due to the high temperatures.",Sam Konstas is set to make his Test debut against India in the Boxing Day Test at the MCG.

VADODARA: In a huge respite to Vinod Kambli ’s fans, his old, cricketing friend, former first-class umpire Marcus Couto has assured that the former India cricket star, who was admitted to a hospital in Thane in Mumbai on Saturday due to a deterioration in his health is ""fine"" now, and ""recovering well.""""Vinod is doing fine now. He is recovering well. He is being treated for Urinary tract infection, ‘Hypokalemia’ (a condition which occurs when the amount of potassium in the blood is lower than normal), and complications arising from an old heart stroke (in 2013). I was with his brother ‘Viru’ Kambli last night at the hospital, and as usual, we were talking about his old cricketing memories,"" Couto told TOI from Mumbai.Interestingly, in a magnanimous gesture, Dr Shailesh Thakur, a die-hard fan of Kambli, the Akruti Health City Hospital in Thane where the 52-year-old has been admitted has decided to foot his treatment bills. The hospital even sent an ambulance to his Bandra residence to bring him to its Kalher facility. Thakur is the director at the hospital.Couto isn't in favour of Kambli being discharged from the hospital soon. ""I told them to treat him at the hospital for a month as he has multiple health complications. Since someone is ready to spend money on his treatment, why not? I wish him a speedy recovery,"" Couto added.Couto's sole concern for his friend is the continuous flow of the local fans visiting the hospital to meet the ailing ex-India cricket star, which puts him danger of catching an infection. ""I had a long conversation with his doctor, Arfat Shaikh, about Vinod's treatment and ended it with a request to stop the non-stop flow of local villagers from visiting him in the ICU of the hospital due to the risk of infection for him as they are clicking pictures, making videos, and indulging in handshakes with him,"" Couto said.Couto, along with his brother Ricky went to meet Kambli at the former India batter's Jewel Cooperative Society in Bandra after his video of not being able to walk properly surfaced in August this year.Kambli, who played 17 Tests and 104 ODIs for India between 1993-2000, had made a rare public appearance recently when he attended the inauguration of legendary coach Ramakant Achrekar’s memorial at the Shivaji Park in Mumbai.The former India cricketer, who has been struggling with health-related issues for quite some time, appeared frail and incoherent in his speech in the function which was also attended by his long-time friend Sachin Tendulkar.","Vinod Kambli was admitted to a hospital in Thane in Mumbai on Saturday.

Jacob Bethell: A 'generational talent' in the making?

Caribbean roots, cricketing dreams

The evolution of Jacob Bethell: From classy Test batter to explosive white-ball cricketer

Stadium Walkthrough series: Inside The Gabba

What can RCB expect from young Bethell?

NEW DELHI: The cricketing fixture between Rugby School and Marlborough College, two of Britain’s most historic independent schools, is a cherished tradition in the English sporting calendar. Dating back to the mid-1800s with the only recent interruption being the COVID-19 pandemic, which disrupted life as we knew it, this storied rivalry holds a special place in the hearts of cricket buffs across Wiltshire and Warwickshire.In 2021, during one such historic encounter, English cricket was on the brink of discovering what Indian spinner R Ashwin has recently described as a potential ""generational talent"". The player in question? None other than Royal Challengers Bengaluru 's newest Rs 2.6 crore recruit, Jacob Bethell .Representing the shades of Rugby School, where he honed his cricketing skills after moving to the UK, Jacob Bethell chose the first innings of the annual two-day fixture to demonstrate his overall mettle. With a stunning knock of 202, he caught the attention of many, including Michael Powell, Rugby School’s Director of Cricket and a former Warwickshire captain.""We had scored over 400 before tea on the first day, with Jacob contributing 200 of those runs. He was playing at a different level from everyone else that day. Then, he went on to take nine or ten wickets in the match as well. The way he went about his business was remarkable,"" recalled Michael during an exclusive interaction with TimesofIndia.com.Michael Powell, however, finds it hard to decide what is more remarkable — the dazzling innings from that fixture or the meteoric rise of young Jacob Bethell, now 21.Over the past few months, Bethell has achieved what few can claim: making his ODI, T20I, and Test debuts within the span of just three months. Even more striking, he became the first English batter since Mike Gatting in 1978 to earn a Test cap without a first-class century to his name, showcasing the high regard in which England Cricket holds him.Coach Michael is a firm believes that his protégé Jacob is destined for greatness. Hailing from a family deeply rooted in cricket — his father and grandfather both being former professional cricketers — Jacob has justified his decision to leave the Caribbean and test his legacy with the willow in the UK.""I took a call from a good friend of ours who was on a cricket tour in Barbados - a cricket tour that I had set up at my previous school in Scotland but had subsequently left. This friend, whose sons were in my boarding house because I was a housemaster there, said that there was a young boy, about 11 years old, who was smashing all their 17-and 18-year-old bowlers around Barbados at the moment. He used to work with the boy's father, Graham Bethell, and that was my first point of contact,"" shared Michael.""He put me in touch with Graham and Giselle Bethell, Jacob's parents, and we started a dialogue. Eventually, they brought Jacob to Rugby School. I then took him over to Edgbaston, to Warwickshire, and introduced him to the academic director, Paul Greetham. That’s how it all began. They explored quite a few schools in the UK because Jacob had trained with the Franklyn Stephenson Academy before. Eventually, they decided on Warwickshire and Rugby School.""Recalling his first meeting with Jacob around a decade ago, the former Warwickshire cricketer continued, ""Jacob was only 11 years old when he first came to visit. He met me, and we had a great afternoon looking around the school. I had already seen a few videos that had been sent to me, including one that has since become quite famous on Instagram — showing him pulling shots as a very young 10-year-old batsman [batter] in the West Indies.""Barbados-born-and-raised, Jacob is known for being deeply family-oriented. The 21-year-old manages to carve out time for his father Graham, mother Giselle, and sister Rebecca, who followed her brother's footsteps and joined Cheltenham College a year later, marking a shared commitment to education and opportunity in the UK.The siblings spent around 32 weeks annually in the UK, dedicating the rest of the year to cherished family moments back home in Barbados.The cricketing blood in Jacob’s veins runs deep, with his father Graham spending many years playing for Sheffield Collegiate in England, where he was teammates with Joe Root ’s father, Matthew Root. Meanwhile, his grandfather, Arthur, was the former captain of the Barbados cricket team in the West Indies.""When he was growing up as a youngster, he probably had a bat in his hand by the age of three. Just the way he operated as a young player at the time — in all aspects, batting, bowling, and fielding — was remarkable. He had a really natural bat swing, as if the bat had been in his hands since his earliest days.""Growing up in Barbados, cricket was in the family and in his genes. He lived an outdoor life in Barbados, blessed with good weather. At home, he had a lovely little setup with a rope and a ball at the end of it, and he would spend hours swinging and hitting the ball. His bat swing was incredibly natural,"" noted Michael.Understood to be a natural athlete, Jacob grew up immersed in a variety of sports — surfing on the beaches of Barbados, playing cricket in the sand, and enjoying golf, tennis, and squash. His innate sporting talent has likely been a key factor in his seamless transition from a graceful stroke-maker in Test cricket to a dynamic power-hitter in white-ball formats.""His early setup and approach to batting were very much Test-match-oriented. As a young player, he was very respectful in how he played and left the ball, yet positive in how he looked to score. However, when he was younger, he didn’t have the power he has now. That’s something he’s gained over the last four or five years,"" explained his childhood tutor.From a young age, Jacob was incredibly stylish, particularly excelling against short-pitched bowling, having grown up facing tall West Indian bowlers who frequently bowled bouncers, which helped him develop his ability to handle the short ball.""I remember the first time I saw him bat — a tall West Indian lad ran in, bowled a bouncer, and Jacob pulled it away. Not many 9-or 10-year-olds could do that. He had a real fluency and fluidity in his bat swing, with great energy and rhythm in how he picked up and swung the bat. He handled taller, faster young West Indian bowlers remarkably well,"" Michael said.""His game has since developed to adapt to the modern game, particularly the white-ball format. Now, as we’ve seen more recently, he can hit the ball out of the park. When I first met him, he struggled to hit the ball off the square or in front of the wicket. He was fantastic with the pull shot and a great sweeper of spin bowling but lacked the physical power to pierce gaps in front of the wicket,"" he added, ""Of course, that power develops with time as a young player grows, and now he’s a strong, athletic young man. He has the ability to hit 100-metre sixes just as easily as he can play the softer game: rotating and manipulating the ball with finesse.""With RCB stacking up their top-order with right-handers, Jacob Bethell, as a left-hander, could be the perfect solution. With Virat Kohli and Phil Salt likely to open the innings, Bethell could slot in at No. 3, with Rajat Patidar following at No. 4, creating a balanced lineup. This versatility, along with his handy slow left-arm orthodox bowling and wicket-keeping skills, has many RCB fans predicting that the English talent will be a regular fixture in the playing XI.""To me, he always looked like a top-order batsman. He thinks like a top-order batsman. The nature of T20 cricket, The Hundred, and white-ball cricket, in general, has pushed him to develop his skills further. Fundamentally, his technique is built for Test cricket, but he’s also developed into a very potent white-ball cricketer. You could class him as an all-rounder or a top-order batsman who bowls very effectively, keeps wicket and fields brilliantly,"" Michael told TimesofIndia.comIn terms of attitude, Michael thinks he is a natural leader. ""As a youngster, Jacob was in England's senior team very early on, and he’s always been a natural leader by example. He’s in a fantastic environment, surrounded by the likes of Joe Root, Ben Stokes, Brendon McCullum , and Marcus Trescothick , who have all performed at the highest level for extended periods. He has the benefit of learning from some of the best minds in the game,"" he added.""For him to be put into the IPL auction, to be chosen, and to have the opportunity to play cricket in that environment is incredible. The IPL is the biggest league in the world, and now he has the chance to be around players like Virat Kohli,"" the man, who has seen Jacob blossom in front of his eyes, concluded.""I know Jacob is made for this—he’s been working toward this his whole life. It’s an incredible opportunity for someone who has put in so much effort. I’m sure RCB fans will thoroughly enjoy watching him, as he’s looking forward to becoming part of the RCB family.""","Jacob Bethell is Royal Challengers Bengaluru's newest Rs 2.6 crore recruit.

NEW DELHI: Nepal batting all-rounder Kushal Malla has been recruited by the Desert Vipers for the third season of the ILT20 .Malla, who was one of the standout performers in the inaugural Nepal Premier League earlier this month, will replace Netherlands all-rounder Bas de Leede , who has been sidelined due to injury.At just 20 years old – turning 21 a month after the tournament ends – Malla boasts considerable experience in international cricket.The left-handed batter and left-arm spin bowler made his ODI debut at the age of 15 years and 340 days against the USA in February 2020, making him the eighth youngest male player to feature in that format.Malla is Nepal's fifth-highest run-scorer in T20Is, having accumulated 917 runs in 47 matches. His tally includes one century, four fifties, and a strike rate of 147.66, the highest among any Nepal batter with over 500 runs in the format.His century, an unbeaten 137 against Mongolia in the 2023 Asian Games, came off just 50 balls, featuring eight fours and 12 sixes. It is also the highest score by a men's number three batter in T20I history.Malla has scored 768 runs in 39 ODIs, including one century and four fifties, making him one of only four male players to score centuries in both international white-ball formats for Nepal.In addition to his batting, he has taken 43 wickets in ODIs and T20Is. Malla was also part of the Nepal team that competed in the ICC T20 World Cup in the USA and the Caribbean earlier this year.Commenting on the signing of Kushal Malla, Desert Vipers Director of Cricket Tom Moody said: ""We are delighted to welcome Kushal to the Desert Vipers.""He is a young player, but for someone so young he already has a significant amount of experience at a high level so we know he will not be phased by stepping into the Vipers' set-up.""It is also a huge positive that Kushal is coming to us off the back of the Nepal Premier League, playing with and against good players in a competitive environment.""As a batter, Kushal can slot in virtually anywhere, having batted from opener to number seven in Twenty20 Internationals, and his strike-rate in the format shows what a dangerous player he is.""And as a bowler, his left-arm spin offers us an option we were previously missing in our squad so that is a huge plus.""I often speak of players with high ceilings and high potential. That is certainly something that applies to Kushal.""We are obviously sorry to be without the services of Bas this season. He fitted in well to our squad last season and we wish him a speedy recovery from the injury that has sidelined him from this tournament.""In Kushal we feel like we have an outstanding replacement, a player who is hungry to achieve something significant on this type of stage, and we believe that being alongside the high-quality and experienced players we have at the Vipers will help him to realise his undoubted potential.""The ILT20 is the UAE's own Twenty20 cricket tournament. The Desert Vipers, runners-up in the inaugural season in 2023, will start their quest for the 2025 title with a match against the Abu Dhabi Knight Riders at the Zayed Cricket Stadium in Abu Dhabi on day two of the tournament, Sunday 12 January at 2pm.","Kushal Malla has been recruited by the Desert Vipers for the third season of the ILT20. Malla was one of the standout performers in the inaugural Nepal Premier League earlier this month.

NEW DELHI: The two modern-day greats, Virat Kohli and Steve Smith , have faced a challenging year in 2024, struggling to make an impact with the bat. In contrast, their fellow ""Fab Four"" members, Kane Williamson and Joe Root , have enjoyed a stellar run, showcasing remarkable form throughout the year.Root and Williamson have been in scintillating form, smashing six and four Test hundreds respectively. In stark contrast, Kohli and Smith have managed just one century each, both scored during the ongoing Border-Gavaskar Trophy .Former Indian cricketer and head coach Ravi Shastri reflected on the shifting fortunes of these players in Test cricket, highlighting the resilience and hunger that continue to make Kohli and Smith formidable opponents despite their recent challenges.""I think they (Kohli and Smith) will have slipped down the ranks on current form because you know you've got the likes of Root taking off, there's Williamson doing well, Harry Brook has come onto the scene, you know there are a lot of other young players pushing but these are class players,"" Shastri said.""In a situation like this, you know they'll be dangerous because they'll be hungry.""Shastri praised Smith's resilience, citing his gritty innings at the Gabba against India, where the Australian maestro notched up his 33rd Test century.""What's needed you saw from Smith. It might have been a struggle early on but he was prepared to play the waiting game and be disciplined,"" Shastri noted.Shastri expressed confidence in Kohli's ability to reclaim his peak form, emphasising that the issue isn't with his overall form but rather with navigating the crucial early phase of his innings.""I think the same with Virat,"" Shastri added. ""If Virat gets over that first 30, 40 minutes, with serious application and discipline, I don't think he's (out of form), none of these guys are out of form.""","Virat Kohli and Steve Smith have faced a challenging year in 2024.

With two matches remaining and World Test Championship (WTC) final qualification at stake, Basit anticipates an Indian victory in the Melbourne Test , scheduled to commence on Thursday.""India will have the best chance to win in Melbourne. There can be two spinners in Melbourne and Sydney. Australia is concerned about the possibility of missing out on the WTC final if they lose in Melbourne. Australia's two matches against Sri Lanka won't be easy.

How many overs in Champions Trophy 2025

The International Cricket Council (ICC) wanted to develop the game in the non-Test playing nations. As a result, the ICC came up with the idea of organising a tournament, which would be known as the ICC Knockout Trophy.The tournament was held in 1998 in Bangladesh and it included the 9 full member nations of the ICC. South Africa were crowned champions of the inaugural edition by beating the West Indies in the final.The competition was once staged in 2000, this time in Kenya to popularise the sport there.All the 9 Test playing nations plus the top 2 associate nations at the time Bangladesh and hosts Kenya were the participants. New Zealand were the champions of the competition by defeating India in the final. The 1998 and the 2000 editions were in a direct knockout format.In 2002, the competition returned under a new name the ICC Champions Trophy . It was initially to be held in India, however, it was shifted to Sri Lanka as India refused to grant the exemption from tax. The ten Test-playing nations plus the associate nations Kenya and the Netherlands participated.This tournament had a round-robin stage with four pools of 3 teams each. Then the knockouts would follow with the first-placed team from each of the 4 pools playing in the semi-finals. Notably, the final which was held on the 29th of September 2002 was suspended due to rain and moved to the 30th of September.However, as per the ICC rules, 25 overs were not bowled to the side batting second due to rain, the trophy was shared and India and Sri Lanka became the joint-winners of the 2002 ICC Champions Trophy Also See: Champions Trophy India matches Venue The 2004 ICC Champions Trophy was hosted by England with 12 participants. The 10 Test playing nations plus Kenya who had ODI status and the USA which had qualified by winning the 2004 ICC Six Nations Tournament.Just like the 2002 format, this tournament also had a round-robin stage with four pools of 3 teams each. Then the knockouts would follow with the first-placed team from each of the 4 pools playing in the semi-finals. The hosts England were beaten by the West Indies in the Final of the competition.10 full member nations were eligible to participate in the 2006 ICC Champions Trophy held in India. The top six teams according to the ICC ODI table rankings would qualify directly while the lower-placed four teams would play a pre-tournament round-robin qualifying round out of which two teams would qualify for the main tournament.In total 8 teams would play the group stages of the tournament in which there were two groups of 4 teams each. Then the top two teams from the two groups would play the semi-finals. Australia defeated the West Indies in the final in 2006.The next ICC Champions Trophy was to be hosted by Pakistan in 2008, however, due to security concerns, it was moved to South Africa in 2009. The 8 highest ranked ODI teams would participate in a group stage with two groups of 4 teams each.Then the top two teams from the two groups would play in the semi-finals. Australia defeated New Zealand in the final to win their second consecutive Champions Trophy title.The next ICC Champions trophy was held after four years in 2013. The format was the same as it was in 2009. England the hosts were beaten by India in the 2013 final and India won their second ICC Champions Trophy title.The 2017 ICC Champions Trophy was once again held in England with the same format as that of 2009 and 2013. Pakistan got the better of their bitter rivals India in the 2017 final as the men in green went on to win their first-ever ICC Champions Trophy title.The ICC Champions Trophy is played in ODI format, meaning each match consists of 50 overs per side, with a maximum of 100 overs in a full match (excluding any reductions due to weather or other interruptions).","ICC Champions Trophy was first held in 1998 in Bangladesh.

Ruud van Nistelrooy , Leicester City 's manager, emphasises the importance of long-term vision after a mixed start to his tenure. Initial success was followed by two significant defeats, but van Nistelrooy remains focused on the overall season goals.Van Nistelrooy's first match as Leicester's manager resulted in a victory against West Ham . However, subsequent matches against Newcastle and Wolves ended in 4-0 and 3-0 losses, respectively.Despite these setbacks, van Nistelrooy maintains a composed perspective. He acknowledges the emotional reactions to weekly results but stresses the need for a broader view.""If you evaluate on a weekly basis into a drama or into a success, that is not the way to work as professionals.""Van Nistelrooy believes that both the media and fans tend to overreact to individual match outcomes. He emphasises that the team's focus remains on the long-term objective of a successful season.""The media and fans will react like that but we know we’re in it for the long run and we know the end of the season is the finish line. That is the bigger picture for me.""He avoids dramatic pronouncements after each game, preferring a consistent approach throughout the season. Van Nistelrooy's focus remains on the ultimate goal of securing Leicester's place in the league.""I'm not going to create a drama every week.

Tottenham Hotspur manager, Ange Postecoglou , anticipates squad reinforcements during the upcoming January transfer window. The team has recently faced challenges with injuries and suspensions, impacting their performance in the Premier League Despite these setbacks, Postecoglou remains committed to his attacking style of play. This approach has contributed to both thrilling victories and disappointing losses in recent matches.Last week's League Cup quarter-final win against Manchester United , ending 4-3, highlighted the team's attacking prowess. However, this was followed by a heavy 6-3 defeat against Liverpool in the league.Postecoglou confirmed his intention to strengthen the squad in January, ahead of the Boxing Day fixture against Nottingham Forest.""Like I said a while ago, we've been planning,"" he told a pre-match press conference.""A lot of it was going to be around where we're at around this time. Fair to say we're still a little bit short in a couple of areas and we need to reinforce.""Tottenham's continued involvement in multiple competitions necessitates squad depth. Postecoglou pointed out the demands of the Carabao Cup, European competition, and the FA Cup.""I think the fact that, obviously, we're still in the Carabao (League) Cup semi-final, still got Europe, FA Cup, we're in all the competitions, it's not like our schedule's going to ease up at any stage.""""So, I think it makes sense. We will try and reinforce. Where and what number we'll have to wait and see.""You don't just want to panic and bring in anybody that you don't think will help our cause in the back half of the year, but I think we've already shown we are pretty methodical and prudent about our work.""Tottenham's recent league form has seen three losses in their last five matches. They currently sit in 11th place in the Premier League table.The team has been juggling league fixtures with cup competitions. They are also managing a substantial injury list, which includes key players such as Guglielmo Vicario, Cristian Romero, and Micky van de Ven.Postecoglou expressed his appreciation for the players who have stepped up during this challenging period. He acknowledged the effort required to implement his demanding playing style.""I can't be critical of this group of players at the moment in any sense,"" he said.""I think it would be unfair for anyone to because what they're doing is they're giving absolute maximum effort.""That's backed up by the physical parameters you put against what they're doing. They're trying to do it in the way that I'm asking them to.""So how can I be critical of that? I think that would be hypocritical of me. The players are doing their part.""They're doing it to the maximum of their ability and it's a credit to them.""Postecoglou also shared his plans for a solitary Christmas Day, a familiar occurrence throughout his managerial career. He mentioned his family's location and his plans to connect with them.""It's a family tradition mate that I'm on my own,"" he said.

Chelsea hold second position in the Premier League , but their manager Enzo Maresca remains grounded, emphasising on Tuesday his focus on team development rather than title discussions.With 35 points, Chelsea trail Liverpool by four points and are scheduled for a West London derby against Fulham on Thursday.The weekend's goalless encounter with Everton prevented Chelsea from claiming the top spot, whilst ending their impressive streak of eight consecutive victories across all competitions and five successive Premier League wins.""We are ahead of our expectation in terms of the way we are playing and points. For us, the main focus is to see how we can improve the players and how we can improve the team,"" Maresca told reporters.""It's the reality for me, not about the pressure (of going for the title). I would like that kind of pressure. I say we are not there because that is the reality for me. The main point is to continue to improve and to win games.""Despite maintaining an eight-point advantage over struggling champions Manchester City , who occupy seventh place, Maresca believes Guardiola's team could still recover in the title race.""It's almost halfway so the table reflects the teams and where they are. Liverpool are doing fantastic since the first day,"" Maresca said.""...I think Manchester City in the end will be there. They are living something that probably never happened before.

Everton manager Sean Dyche emphasizes that his team won't underestimate Manchester City, despite the reigning champions' recent struggles.Everton's form has improved significantly. They've lost only twice in their last 12 matches after a difficult start to the season.Manchester City, accustomed to success, has experienced a dip in form. The four-time consecutive Premier League winners have lost nine of their last 12 games leading into the Boxing Day match against Everton.""They (City) have enjoyed so much success under Pep (Guardiola) over the years that everybody seems to be under this impression that it's when, not if, it turns back,"" said Dyche.Dyche acknowledges City's dominance under Pep Guardiola and the expectation of their eventual return to form. He also recognizes the rarity of such a challenging period for a manager like Guardiola.""I don't know all of Pep's history, but I think it's unlikely he's had too many spells like this.""Dyche acknowledges Guardiola’s exceptional track record, labelling him ""arguably one of the best ever."" The Everton manager views City's current struggles as a testament to the Premier League's competitiveness.""You'd think at some point it happens, even to the best, and he is arguably one of the best ever, but for him to have a testing period actually shows how tough the game is even for the top sides.""Dyche points out that even the best teams are susceptible to difficulties if they don't maintain attention to detail. He emphasizes that Everton are also working on improving their performance.""The details, even for the top teams, if you don't get them right, then things don't work out for you. They'll be trying to correct that.""Everton, while improving, still aims to increase their win count and goal tally. Dyche stresses the importance of a strong performance against City. He dismisses the notion of an easy win simply due to City's current form.""We're in the process of correcting somewhat what we were doing. We still need to win more games, obviously, and score more goals.""Dyche emphasizes the need for a determined and robust performance from his side. He acknowledges the quality of City’s players and manager despite their recent struggles.""It's not like you go there and think, 'We're going to win just because'. We've got to go and deliver a performance. We've got to play hard, we've got to play strong.""Dyche dismisses the idea that City’s players have suddenly become less skilled or that Guardiola's managerial abilities have diminished.""They haven't all become terrible players overnight. He (Guardiola) certainly is not a terrible manager.""Everton will be missing Ashley Young due to suspension after accumulating five yellow cards.

Manchester City 's poor performance, with just one victory in eight Premier League matches, is a collective team issue rather than an individual's fault, according to manager Pep Guardiola 's statement on Tuesday. He emphasised that striker Erling Haaland should not be singled out for criticism.The champions' current position at seventh place, trailing Liverpool by 12 points, has coincided with Haaland's reduced scoring rate. After netting 10 goals in the initial five matches, the Norwegian has only scored twice during this difficult period.""It's about us, it's not just about one player,"" Guardiola told a press conference ahead of Thursday's game with Everton .""So when in the past we scored goals and Erling was so prolific in helping us, it's because of the team. And when you have problems at the back, in the middle, it's for everyone.""If it was just one player, the reason why, it would be easy. It's not about that. Erling is so important for us, will be so important for us, has been, and we try to do the things better, to use him better.""The availability of John Stones , Matheus Nunes and Ederson remains uncertain for the Everton fixture. Despite being unable to identify a specific cause for their recent struggles, Guardiola expressed confidence about an improvement in results soon.Regarding their current difficulties, Guardiola addressed various aspects affecting the team's performance, acknowledging that multiple factors have contributed to their decline in form. He emphasised the importance of upcoming matches as opportunities for improvement.Everton, despite being 15th in the table and 11 points behind City, has demonstrated strong defensive capabilities with five clean sheets in their previous six matches.Guardiola praised Sean Dyche 's tactical approach, particularly highlighting Everton's defensive organisation and effectiveness in transitions.With the Boxing Day fixture approaching, City's players will have limited family time during Christmas. The team's schedule includes training sessions and an overnight stay before the match on December 26.","Manchester City have won just one of their last eight Premier League matches.

Bournemouth manager Andoni Iraola is emphasizing the need for his team to maintain their strong performance at both ends of the field. He believes this is key to continuing their positive start to the Premier League season.The Cherries recently secured a 3-0 victory against Manchester United at Old Trafford , extending their unbeaten streak in the Premier League to five games. This impressive run has placed them fifth in the league standings.However, the upcoming busy Christmas and New Year period will challenge their squad depth. Their holiday campaign kicks off with a home match against Crystal Palace on Thursday.""I want to be as efficient as we can,"" said Iraola as per AFP.Iraola stressed the importance of replicating their performance against Manchester United. He acknowledged that maintaining this level consistently will be challenging.""If we can continue with the level in both boxes that we had on Sunday, it will be much easier -- but this is not a guarantee.""He expressed confidence in the team's ability to perform well as long as they continue creating opportunities and maintaining their current level of play.""As long as we continue creating chances and having the performances we are having, I think we will be fine.""Iraola also admitted that sustaining this consistency over an extended period is easier said than done.""This is easy to say -- but it is not easy to keep this consistency during a long period.""Bournemouth's impressive form has sparked hopes of European football amongst their fans. However, Iraola remains grounded and refuses to get carried away by the current league standings.He highlighted the competitiveness of the Premier League this season, noting the unpredictable nature of results. Any team can win or lose against any opponent.""The standings are super compact.""Iraola emphasized the importance of maintaining competitiveness and letting the final table determine their position at the end of the season.""We are seeing, especially this season in the Premier League, that every team can win against anyone and can also lose (against anyone).""He believes it's premature to focus on anything beyond the upcoming matches against Crystal Palace and Fulham.""So we have to keep being competitive and let's see where the table puts us.

Rohit Sharma: 'Virat Kohli is a modern day great. He will figure it out'

While settled is not a space athletes would choose for themselves given that the race is all about moving forward, it’s equitable usage in the world of doubles and partnerships. Ask Yuki Bhambri .The 32-year-old, mid-career in the two-man team game, played alongside seven partners before settling with the 6-ft-8 Albano Olivetti with whom he contested 16 tournaments in 2024, making four finals and winning two titles, and finishing the year with a top-50 ranking for the first time in his career.“Four finals is good effort,” Bhambri said. “I don't think this was a fantastic season, but from where I was in January to where it ended, it’s good. It's nice to start a season with an existing partnership, that gives us a little bit of an edge.”Bhambri and Olivetti have Brisbane and Adelaide in their plans before the Australian Open in January.The Indo-French combine did well in the ATP 250s but are yet to break through in the higher category events.“We're still finding our feet in bigger events, in some matches we had chances, but some others we were just blown away,” Bhambri said. “This season was more of a learning experience we can do better in the next season thanks to all that we have learnt.”Bhambri, who finished the season with an individual doubles ranking of No. 48, did something he hasn’t done in the last five years, even when his body was broken and his spirits were low. In November he lined up a group of friends for an end-of-season holiday to Norway, ticking off the Northern Lights, which has long been on his bucket list.“We were there for a week, three cities -- Trondheim, Lofoten and Oslo. It was a nice break, a lot of snow, wind and layering (clothing),” Bhambri said, adding, “This was a mixed group, six of us. The good thing that came out of being injured (end of 2018 to early 2022) is that I got to spend a lot of time at home, I became social. I had the opportunity to meet some cool people outside of tennis.”“This holiday happened at a good time, I had a good season, that’s reason to celebrate. Some of the others in the group were also celebrating anniversaries and milestone birthdays so it was just nice,” Bhambri said.The 32-year-old, who was ranked No.1 in the juniors, winning boys singles title in the 2009 Australian Open, said his biggest takeaway from the season was patience.“I remember in January and February, I was really rattled. I was hoping to kick on to the next level… and not having those wins initially was tough,” he said. “Doubles is very fast-paced and unpredictable. You could be going home happy or sad depending on one point literally. I hadn't really experienced that roller-coaster of emotions before.”“I continued to do the work and play the matches with a positive frame of mind, but I do remember going into some events earlier on where you sort of doubted yourself a little bit. I wondered if I belonged in this level or not,” he said.Bhambri shifted to doubles after sitting out three seasons, save for a couple of tournaments, struggling with tendonitis on his right knee.“In singles you can see who the better player is at times,” he said. “In doubles you could bring all the right things to the court and still end up on the losing side.”Bhambri, who climbed to a career best No. 83 in singles in April 2018, learned the importance of being ‘level-headed’ while navigating the storm of competition. It doesn’t always add up in match play, but it is important to persevere.","Yuki Bhambri and Albano Olivetti have settled into doubles partnership.

Rohit Sharma: 'Virat Kohli is a modern day great. He will figure it out'

There’s a quasi-Indian story brewing in world tennis that has set tongues wagging. A Guntur-chili eating, Tollywood-watching teenager is burning the rectangle. Only the icon against his name is the United States flag, the country he was born and raised in.Nishesh Basavareddy , born in Newport Beach, California and grew up in Carmel, Indiana, started the 2024 season ranked No. 457; he’s at a career-high No. 138 in the ATP ranking presently.The 19-year-old enjoyed a rousing run on the Challenger Tour where he made six finals, winning two titles, including one in his last outing in Mexico. The American’s show, racking up a 41-13 record, not only earned him a place in the ATP Next Gen Finals in Jeddah, starting December 18, but also saw him clinch the USTA Australian Open wildcard that secured his spot in the Melbourne Park main draw.Basavareddy studied Data Science at Stanford University for two years before announcing in early December that he was turning professional.The American teenager, bespectacled, with a studious appearance, explained the Collegiate route was what the doctor ordered for him.“I was 17 when I graduated,” he said. “I had a lot of areas where I needed to mature, it was not just physically, as a person also. I had a lot of injuries when I was a junior so I thought it would be good to get a couple more years of matches in college while also having time to develop physically and tennis wise. Turning pro straight away after high school was never really an option for me.”Basavareddy is mentored by two-time Olympic silver medallist and multiple-time major winner Rajeev Ram , who also resides in Carmel, Indiana.“When I moved to Indiana, I started working with the same coach that he (Ram) used to work with and still does,” he said. “We started meeting when he was home from the Tour. Then, when I started to play professional tennis, he gave me advice about what to expect on the Tour and what to expect in this transition.”The teenager’s father Murali Reddy works in the Tech industry while his older brother Nishanth majored in Information Systems, both played tennis, his father more recreationally, while their mother Sai Prasanna is a homemaker. Basavareddy , who visited India often in his childhood, has family in Hyderabad and Nellore.The cuisine of choice for the family is Indian. Basavareddy says he’s not fluent in Telugu but doesn’t need subtitles when he’s watching Tollywood flicks.Basavareddy, twinkled-toed and thinking cap in place, picks his tennis IQ and return game as his biggest strengths.“I watched so much tennis when I was younger, I used to always have Tennis Channel running, trying to learn from whatever commentators were saying about the pros. I just love watching tennis,” he says. “I think just being able to see so many different matches, seeing what players are doing I was able to learn different strategies that I could employ against certain players. That has evolved over time.”Tennis will get a sense of it in January Down Under, where Basavareddy, 5-ft-11, will try to outthink and outplace opponents in what promises to be an exciting first full season.","Nishesh Basavareddy was born in Newport Beach, California and grew up in Carmel, Indiana.

'Super afraid': Jannik Sinner and Iga Swiatek doping issues heighten tension among players,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/top-stories/jannik-sinner-and-iga-swiatek-doping-issues-heighten-tension-among-players/articleshow/116601911.cms,"Jannik Sinner (AFP Photo)

Professional tennis players are increasingly worried about unintentional doping violations due to contamination, especially after recent high-profile cases involving Jannik Sinner and Iga Swiatek . Both players faced doping charges but were eventually cleared. These incidents highlight the challenges athletes face regarding supplement contamination and the complexities of the anti-doping system.Sinner and Swiatek, who both reached the top ranking in professional tennis, incurred substantial expenses to demonstrate the unintentional nature of the banned substances found in their systems. This financial burden raises concerns for players with fewer resources.“A lot of the players I know are quite apprehensive,” former U.S. Open champion Emma Raducanu said.Raducanu expressed her concerns about the risk of contamination in supplements and the financial burden of batch testing. Many players are cautious about the supplements they take due to the risk of contamination.“Everything we take, we're aware of the situation and how easily things can be contaminated. There are certain supplements that I may want to take, but I can't take them because they're sold over the counter and not batch tested.”The cost of batch testing, exceeding $1,000, creates a financial barrier for many athletes.Russian tennis player Andrey Rublev , a former world number five, shared similar anxieties about consuming anything he's not entirely certain about. He admitted to being 'super afraid.'Andrea Petroczi, a researcher on anti-doping at Kingston University in London, confirmed the growing apprehension among elite athletes worldwide regarding unintentional doping violations due to contamination. Her research reveals increasing concerns among athletes about the potential consequences of such violations.“(They) expressed fear and anxiety about unintentionally violating anti-doping rules that could have grave consequences on their reputation, careers and livelihoods,” Petroczi explained.Athletes are adopting various precautionary measures to minimize the risk of contamination. These measures include thoroughly checking medications, avoiding unnecessary treatments, and opting for third-party tested supplements.Athletes also meticulously record batch numbers of supplements and medicines. Some even go to the extent of maintaining detailed logs and avoiding specific foods in certain countries. However, they recognize that even these precautions cannot entirely eliminate the risk.“Importantly, it's also crucial to acknowledge that the resources and strategies required for this level of vigilance aren't universally accessible,” Petroczi emphasized.The accessibility of resources and strategies for such vigilance varies across different regions. This disparity in access creates additional challenges for athletes in certain areas.“There is a clear 'Global North'/'Global South' divide, with disparities in education, resources and support systems, leaving many athletes more vulnerable.”Jannik Sinner's case involved trace amounts of clostebol, an anabolic androgenic steroid. He successfully demonstrated to doping authorities that the substance entered his system through massages administered by his physiotherapist.Despite being cleared, Sinner faces a potential ban of up to two years due to an appeal by the World Anti-Doping Agency. The ongoing appeal creates uncertainty regarding Sinner's future participation in professional tennis.Iga Swiatek, who tested positive for trimetazidine, a hormone and metabolic modulator, served a one-month ban. She attributed the positive test to contamination of her sleep medication.Swiatek revealed the significant financial costs she incurred in defending her case, including legal fees and expert opinions. She spent $70,000 on a lawyer and over $15,000 on expert opinions.“Importantly, it's also crucial to acknowledge that the resources and strategies required for this level of vigilance aren't universally accessible,” Petroczi emphasized.The handling of Sinner and Swiatek's cases contrasts with the experiences of other players, such as Simona Halep and Tara Moore , who have criticized the anti-doping system for lengthy delays in their cases. The contrasting experiences highlight inconsistencies in the handling of doping cases.The International Tennis Integrity Agency (ITIA) assumed responsibility for tennis's anti-doping program in 2022. The ITIA was formed by the seven governing bodies of tennis after a comprehensive review of the previous system, which was overseen by the International Tennis Federation.Sinner and Swiatek's cases are the most high-profile investigations undertaken by the ITIA since it took over. Both players held the world number one ranking when they failed their tests, further highlighting the significance of these cases.The ITIA asserts that all doping cases are handled impartially, based on evidence and facts, irrespective of a player's ranking, name, or nationality. However, concerns about potential discrepancies in the system persist.Petroczi highlighted the impact of limited access to legal representation and advanced analytical testing on an athlete's ability to effectively contest a doping case . These limitations create further disparities within the system.Being unable to access legal representation and advanced analytical testing would impact an athlete's ability to fight a doping case, Petroczi added, and sports federations and anti-doping organisations had to address this disparity in resources.Addressing the disparity in resources available to athletes requires collective efforts from sports federations and anti-doping organizations. These efforts should focus on ensuring equitable access to expert support and transparency in processes.“Efforts could include providing equitable access to expert support, ensuring transparency in processes, and exploring ways to mitigate the impact of resource gaps,” Petroczi suggested.Unlike athletes in many other sports, tennis players are essentially self-employed. Therefore, any time away from the game due to a doping ban or related legal battles directly impacts their income.Andrey Rublev advocated for quicker rulings in cases of accidental contamination and a degree of flexibility in the anti-doping rules. He believes the current system is overly strict and creates undue fear among players.“Of course, you want to have a clean sport,” Rublev stated.He emphasized the importance of maintaining a clean sport while also expressing concerns about the strictness of the current rules. He believes the system needs to be more flexible to avoid penalizing players for unintentional violations.“But you also want (it to be) not so strict because then you make all the tennis players so afraid that even those situations (that are not you fault) cost you a year.”The current system can lead to significant penalties, including lengthy bans, even in cases of accidental contamination. This creates a climate of fear among players.“It shouldn't be like that.”",Professional tennis players are increasingly worried about unintentional doping violations due to contamination.

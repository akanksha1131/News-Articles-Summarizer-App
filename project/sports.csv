India's T20I record in 2024: A year of domination marked by World Cup success,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/indias-t20i-record-in-2024-a-year-of-domination-marked-by-world-cup-success/articleshow/115374133.cms,"Tilak Varma and Sanju Samson (BCCI Photo)

NEW DELHI: The Indian cricket team concluded their final T20I assignment in record-breaking fashion. With Sanju Samson and Tilak Varma at the forefront, India scored a massive 283 - their second highest T20I total - at Johannesburg. The massive score put South Africa more or less out of the equation when they came to chase and India went on to win the clash and series by 3-1.The performance and the series win were fitting for India who had a stellar year in the T20 format. Across 2024, India played 26 matches, won 24 and lost two (against Zimbabwe and South Africa).India's win percentage in T20I was 92.31, the highest ever by any team in the format, surpassing Pakistan's 89.47% in 2018 (17 wins in 19 matches). In T20s, only Tamil Nadu's 93.75% in 2021 (15 wins in 16 matches) has been better in a year.The icing on the cake in 2024, or the cake itself, was the T20 World Cup title in the West Indies and USA. By going unbeaten throughout the tournament, India not only shed the bad memory of the ODI World Cup final defeat a couple of months earlier, they also ended their 11-year ICC title drought.Besides the title win that defined the team in 2024, they played five bilateral series - against Afghanistan, Zimbabwe, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and South Africa - to win them all.With Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli stepping away from the shortest format after the T20 World Cup, the responsibility of leading the team went to Suryakumar Yadav and he has carried that with aplomb. India triumphed away in Zimbabwe, Sri Lanka and South Africa while also beating Bangladesh at home.Rohit and Virat, two of India's greatest cricketers, received a fitting farewell from T20Is. Rohit retired as a two-time T20 World Cup champion and India's all-time leading T20I run-scorer (4,231 runs in 159 matches, including five centuries and 32 fifties). At the T20 World Cup, he scored 257 runs in eight matches, including three half-centuries.Kohli, who had a modest tournament, delivered a decisive performance in the final against South Africa with a match-winning 75, earning the 'Player of the Match' accolade. He retired as the format's second-highest run-scorer, amassing 4,188 runs in 125 matches at an average of 48.69, with one century and 38 fifties.Except for the stalwarts, the youngsters embodied the aggression and ""win-at-all-costs"" attitude that was needed - especially after the 2021 World Cup.India struck a boundary every 4.68 balls this year, their best-ever ratio, and a six every 12.19 balls, another best.India scored 200-plus totals nine times, three times in the series against South Africa, thereby breaking the record for the most in a calendar year, previously held by Birmingham Bears (2022), India (2023), and Japan (2024) with seven each.Men in Blue batters scored centuries in almost every series in 2024, a stark contrast to their conservative approach of the years gone by. With seven centuries -- three by Sanju Samson, two by Tilak Varma, and one each by Rohit Sharma and Abhishek Sharma -- India set a record for the most team centuries in a calendar year in T20Is.India's overall runs-per-over (RPO) this year stood at 9.55, their highest ever and the second-highest by a men's T20I team in a calendar year (minimum 15 matches), only behind Australia's 9.72 in 2024.Individually, Sanju Samson flourished as an opener, scoring three centuries, the first-ever by any player. He was India's top run-getter in T20Is in 2024 with 436 runs in 12 innings, averaging 43.60 with a strike rate of over 180. As an opener, he tallied 461 runs in nine innings, averaging 57.62 and striking at 193.62.At the other end of the spectrum, he also recorded five ducks in the year - the most for an Indian player. Regis Chakabva of Zimbabwe had also recorded five scores of nought in 2022.During the fifth T20I in Johannesburg, Samson and Tilak Varma scored centuries in the same innings, marking the first instance of such a milestone for a Test-playing nation in a T20I.India's top five batters collectively struck at 135.08 in their first 10 balls this year, the highest-ever for the team and the third-highest for any side with a minimum of 15 matches.Eleven Indian batters scored 200-plus runs this year, with eight maintaining strike rates above 150. Among them were Tilak (306 runs at a strike rate of 187.73), Samson (436 runs, 180.16), and Yashasvi Jaiswal (293 runs, 172.35). Remarkably, five of these batters also averaged over 40.The year belonged not just to the batters but also the fielders. They bowled out the opponents 10 times in 26 matches, the joint-most for a Test-playing nation in a calendar year.Arshdeep Singh led the charge with the ball, taking 36 wickets in 18 matches at an average of 13.50, his haul the highest for a Test-playing nation bowler this year. The left-arm pacer finished the year out with two wickets needed to surpass Yuzvendra Chahal and become the leading wicket-taker for India in the format.Indian bowlers averaged 8.39 wickets per innings, the highest-ever among Test-playing nations in a calendar year.India recorded three victories by margins of 100-or-more this year, matching their tally from all previous years combined.In 2024, India also witnessed two of their top-five biggest wins in terms of balls remaining and one of only two 10-wicket victories in their T20I history.","India's win percentage in T20I was 92.31, the highest ever by any team in the format. India's overall runs-per-over (RPO) this year stood at 9.55, their highest ever.

NEW DELHI: Mike Tyson , the former world heavyweight champion, shared that he has no regrets about his loss to Jake Paul in their heavyweight boxing match on Saturday.The 58-year-old boxing legend faced a unanimous decision defeat to 27-year-old YouTube star Paul on Friday at AT&T Stadium, home of the Dallas Cowboys. The event drew a massive crowd of 72,300 fans, with an additional 60 million households tuning in globally, according to Netflix's broadcast.""This is one of those situations when you lost but still won. I’m grateful for last night. No regrets to get in ring one last time,"" Tyson wrote on social media after the bout.""I almost died in June. Had 8 blood transfusions. Lost half my blood and 25lbs in hospital and had to fight to get healthy to fight so I won,"" he added.""To have my children see me stand toe to toe and finish 8 rounds with a talented fighter half my age in front of a packed Dallas Cowboy stadium is an experience that no man has the right to ask for. Thank you,"" he said.Paul, 27, relied on his superior speed and movement to dominate the ageing Tyson, putting the former undisputed heavyweight champion under pressure with a flurry of punches in the third round.Despite this, the younger fighter failed to deliver the knockout blow he had promised during the heated weigh-in, where Tyson slapped him across the face.Tyson, looking every bit his 58 years, managed to land only a few meaningful punches throughout the fight.Final statistics revealed Tyson connected with just 18 of 97 punches thrown, while Paul threw 278 punches and landed 78 of them.As the final seconds of the eighth round ticked away, Paul even bowed in respect to Tyson before the bell sounded.","Former world heavyweight champion Mike Tyson lost to YouTube star Jake Paul on Saturday.

What do you make of the 0-3 drubbing at home against New Zealand?

How long does it take to adjust to Australian conditions, where there is pace and bounce, after playing on rank turners at home?

The Indian team seems to be slipping in the race for the WTC final...

Compared to now, was it different touring Australia in, say, 2003-04?

How important is it to set the tone early? Will the uncertainty over captain

’s presence hamper India in Perth?

This team seems to be in transition. Do you think the young generation is ready to step into a senior role?

For this generation of batters who have grown up on IPL, attack is their best form of defence. Do you think true bouncy tracks in Australia will be good for them?

There’s some uncertainty about who bats at No. 8 especially when you are not sure about playing two spinners…

Indian teams started competing in Australia consistently since the 2003-04 series where Sourav Ganguly ’s team came back with a 1-1 scoreline. As India get ready for another series Down Under following the debacle against New Zealand at home, Ganguly spoke to TOI about a host of topics. in India, setting the tone early in Australia and the next generation stepping up. Excerpts…It was surprising and unexpected. It’s a wake-up call for the team before going into such a big series in Australia. It must have given them a lot to think about and introspect what was lacking in the home series. But the team should always be looking to move forward and not carry the baggage of previous defeats.I don’t agree with the kind of pitches India played on in India. These square turning pitches serve no purpose at all. We have to believe that our spinners are good enough to take wickets on good pitches. Such pitches bring the opposition into the game. If batters get runs, it will eventually bring your quality spinners into the game at the backend of the match. Batters have not got runs and it’s tough to be in form on such pitches.You can’t go into a big series thinking so far ahead. Australia has always been a tough place to tour. It’s one of the hardest series to play. I suppose they have 10-12 days to train hard for the first Test. If the Indian team isn’t playing any practice matches, they must be focused on the areas they need to work on.In a way, it’s a good thing that the first Test is in Perth. It is a new stadium but the nature of pitches in Perth are such that the match will be result oriented. India need to think that the result will go in their favour. There will be no half measures in Perth and a draw is very unlikely.We used to play a couple of tour games before a series and that gave us an idea of how matches progress in Australia. One must remember we were a team which was doing well consistently overseas for a couple of years, be it the tour of England or the 2003 World Cup. We were a very confident bunch of players and had belief in ourselves. But things have changed now.These players travel to Australia more frequently. They always have a fresh idea about the conditions. And the majority of the players in this team have played quite a bit in Australia. That’s why even 10-12 days of hard practice along with a clear mind can be enough for these players. One must not forget this is almost the same set of players that won the previous two series in Australia.It’s very important to get off to a good start. It puts you in a great position in the series. I’m not sure about how Rohit is placed with his personal life. But had I been in his place, I would be eager to reach Perth and be a part of the Test if things were under control at home.Having said that, there are a plenty of senior batters like Virat Kohli and Rishabh Pant who can take the responsibility and set the tone. Body language on the field has to be very positive but that shouldn’t be a distraction, especially in hostile conditions. Execution is the key.I don’t want to get into the talks of transition since I am not privy to what is happening in the system. If you talk about the next generation, then there is already Rishabh Pant who is a proven performer in overseas conditions for some years now. I believe a lot will revolve around him. I have a feeling Shubman Gill and Pant can go to the next level as senior batters at the end of the series.Talking about a settled batting lineup, I don’t see anything drastically unsettled. There’s Kohli, KL Rahul, Pant, Gill and Rohit who will hopefully join the team as soon as possible. They have toured and played a lot of cricket together. Yashashvi Jaiswal is a very good prospect too.One must acknowledge the game has changed a lot now. These batters have a range of shots and like to play in a certain way. But good players are those who can buckle down and be determined when there is help for the bowlers. That’s why I wasn’t happy with the rank turners in India which gave batters very little breathing space.There are enough good batters which can take the batting deep. R Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja have shown their ability down the order. Then there’s Washinton Sundar as well. Whether you are willing to play two spinners, keeping the batting stability in mind is a call the team management has to take. Our bowling attack is good. And from what I gather, Mohammed Shami seems to be bowling well for Bengal. I won’t be surprised if we see him at some point of the five-Test series. That will boost the pace attack and then one can take that call regarding No. 8.",Sourav Ganguly speaks to TOI about India's upcoming series in Australia.

NEW DELHI: Pat Cummins ' Australia are set to challenge India's quest for a historic third consecutive Border-Gavaskar Trophy series win on Australian soil, this time facing a new Indian captain eager to make history.The much-anticipated clash begins with the opening Test on November 22 in Perth.India previously secured back-to-back series wins in Australia, first under Virat Kohli's leadership in 2018-19 and then with Ajinkya Rahane at the helm in 2020-21.Now, with Rohit Sharma as captain, Team India is eyeing an unprecedented third straight triumph Down Under.Can Cummins and his team halt India's series-winning streak?""Yes. Yes is the answer,"" Cummins said in response to a question by TimesOfIndia.com during an interaction with select media, organised by broadcaster Star Sports.""I've known Rohit obviously from playing against him a lot, but I've never played alongside him, so I don't know him super well. But India always look like they're pretty well-organised and well-planned. Fortunately, over the last few years, we've had some success in theWorld Test Championship (WTC) final and, in a different format, the ODI World Cup. So, we'll be trying to lean on those memories, just as I'm sure they're recalling some of the previous series over here as well,"" the Australian skipper said.India's pace attack will be led by star pacer Jasprit Bumrah . With veteran Mohammed Shami unavailable, Bumrah will be supported by Mohammed Siraj and a promising trio of young bowlers — Harshit Rana, Prasidh Krishna, and Akash Deep.For Australian skipper Cummins, Bumrah stands out as India's X-factor in the series.Bumrah boasts an impressive record in Australia, having played seven Tests and taken 32 wickets, including a five-wicket haul.""I am a big fan of Bumrah. He is a fantastic bowler and can play a big role for India in the series. He’s one of the guys who has played a lot of cricket in Australia,"" Cummins said.Cummins also acknowledged the absence of India's batting stars Cheteshwar Pujara and Rahane from the Border-Gavaskar Trophy.""They (Rahane and Pujara) both scored some really important innings. It was always great playing against Pujara. He was one of those guys who never really felt like he was getting away from you. But then he would bat, and bat, and bat, and bat,"" Cummins said.""I always really enjoyed the contest against him. Some days he won, other days I won. So, it's going to feel a bit different without him,"" he said.","India seeking third consecutive Border-Gavaskar Trophy series win on Australian soil.

Fritz's revenge chance

Jannik Sinner has his first ATP Finals crown firmly in his sights after crushing Casper Ruud 6-1, 6-2 on Saturday to set up a title decider with Taylor Fritz , the man he beat to win the US Open two months ago.Roared on by a partisan home crowd in Turin, Sinner extended his winning streak to 10 matches with another dominating display which showed why he is the first Italian to top the ATP's end-of-season world rankings.The 23-year-old has reacted to losing last year's final to Novak Djokovic by displacing the Serbian tennis icon at the top of the game, winning seven tournaments this season including his debut Grand Slam victory at the Australian Open before triumphing in New York in September.Sinner barely gave Ruud time to breathe as he rattled off the first three games and took the first set in half an hour, before sweeping to a comprehensive victory.""It's a great, great feeling. It's really special playing here,"" said Sinner.""It's a really important tournament, last year we lost the final, this year we've got a chance to try again and do better than we did last season.""But regardless of how it goes tomorrow it's been an emotional week with some great moments.""Ruud, who hadn't played Sinner for three years before Saturday, compared the shots he faced to ""rockets"" and was struck by how much he has improved.""You feel like unless you hit a ball with really good depth or close to the sidelines, and even if you hit close to the sidelines but not fast enough, he's going to rip it back at you,"" Ruud told reporters.""I got to practice with him here earlier leading up to the tournament. He also kicked my ass there. In a way I knew what I was facing today.""Fritz has a task on his hands to become the first American Finals winner since Pete Sampras 25 years ago as he has been comfortably beaten both times he has faced Sinner this year, with straight sets victories in the US Open final and the group stage in Turin.The world number five is the first US man to make the final since James Blake in 2006 after a thrilling 6-3, 3-6, 7-6 (7/3) triumph over Zverev.Fritz has a chance for revenge on Sinner for the US Open final defeat, following a gruelling match in northern Italy.Both players had chances to take control in a topsy-turvy third set, but failed to capitalise on a host of break points before Fritz held his nerve better in the tie-break to claim a spot in the final.Fritz managed to save three break points in game five of the third set, just when it looked like Zverev was set to take control of the match.""That was probably the biggest turning point, I lose one of those points and that's probably it. That's kind of how it goes with playing Sascha,"" said Fritz, who got to the semis two years ago.Zverev was aiming for a tour-leading 70th win of the season but his winning streak was snapped at eight matches after coming into Saturday's clash having not dropped a single set or service game in Turin.The 27-year-old admitted that he failed to take his chances when it counted after playing arguably the better tennis in the closing two sets of the match.""It was one of those days where everything, it takes times to get going,"" said Zverev.""It's like it's not a natural flow to movement patterns, to your shots as well, to just how you wake up in the morning. Everything is a little bit more tiring. I felt that way today.""On Friday night Zverev described the men's tennis calendar as ""crazy"", saying that he had not spent more than three consecutive days at home all year.","Italy's Jannik Sinner beats Casper Ruud 6-1, 6-2 to reach ATP Finals final. Sinner will play Taylor Fritz, who he beat to win the US Open two months ago. Fritz is the first US man to make the final since James Blake in 2006.

NEW DELHI: Former Australian cricketers Adam Gilchrist and Matthew Hayden have defended teammate Ricky Ponting following India head coach Gautam Gambhir 's befitting reply to Ponting's comments on Virat Kohli and skipper Rohit Sharma 's form ahead of high-profile Border-Gavaskar Trophy.The duo’s straightforward stance highlighted their belief in honest critique and the role of commentary in cricket, countering Gambhir’s assertion that Ponting should focus solely on Australian cricket.Gilchrist stated that Ponting, as a cricket legend and commentator, has every right to share his opinions on global cricket, emphasizing the importance of open discussions.“Punter can comment on anything he wants. I think he has earned the right to comment on most aspects of cricket. I love this, this is going to get the popcorn out for the rest of the summer,” said legendary wicketkeeper Adam Gilchrist on the Club Prairie Fire podcast.Hayden, known for his bluntness, dismissed the notion that commentary should be limited to national boundaries.“We are paid to make an opinion, make a comment and make a call about the game we know and love,"" said Hayden on the podcast.In 2024, Kohli has struggled with his form, scoring just 488 runs in 25 innings across formats in 19 international matches, averaging 20.33. His performances in home Tests were particularly concerning, managing only one half-century in five matches against Bangladesh and New Zealand, with an average of 21.33 across those series.During the three-Test series against New Zealand, which India lost 0-3, Kohli scored 93 runs in six innings, slightly outpacing Rohit Sharma, who scored 91. Both senior batters faced criticism for their inability to deliver under pressure in critical games.India's upcoming five-Test series against Australia, beginning on November 22 at the Optus Stadium in Perth, is pivotal. With India currently ranked second in the World Test Championship (WTC) points table, strong performances in this series are crucial to maintaining their qualification hopes for the WTC final.","Former Australian cricketers Adam Gilchrist and Matthew Hayden have defended teammate Ricky Ponting.

NEW DELHI: India dished out an all-round performance to inflict a massive 135-run defeat on South Africa in the fourth and final T20I in Johannesburg on Friday. With this victory, India clinched the four-match series 3-1.Chasing a mammoth 284-run target, South Africa were rattled by pacer Arshdeep Singh 's brilliance as he swung the ball both ways. He dismissed Reeza Hendricks in the first over and then quickly followed up with the wickets of Aiden Markram and Heinrich Klaasen His astonishing effort helped India reduce the hosts to a disastrous 10/4 within just 3 overs, effectively ending the contest early.South Africa's only focus now was to save face, with David Miller and Tristan Stubbs leading the fightback. The pair put on 86 runs before Varun Chakravarthy struck, dismissing Miller.Stubbs fell off the very next ball to Ravi Bishnoi, and India wrapped up the innings, bowling South Africa out in the 19th over. Marco Jansen showed his all-round abilities with a few big hits, but it was too little, too late.Earlier, Sanju Samson 's precision andTilak Varma 's muscular elegance combined as India effortlessly dismantled the South African bowling attack to post a commanding 283/1.This total not only marked India's highest-ever T20I score overseas but also became the highest by any team on South African soil.Among the numerous records shattered, the standout achievement was the rare feat of two Indian batters scoring centuries in the same T20I innings. Samson and Varma also set the record for India’s highest-ever partnership in T20Is—210 runs off just 93 balls for the second wicket.Samson (109* off 56 balls), who had already struck a brilliant century in the first game, once again put the Proteas to the sword alongside Varma (120* off 47 balls), who has been in sensational form at number three, brimming with confidence and vigour.Samson now has three T20I centuries in his last five innings, including two ducks, while Varma has scored back-to-back centuries.Samson reached his century in 51 balls, while Varma took just 41 balls to bring up his ton—10 balls fewer than his partner.Abhishek Sharma (36 off 18 balls) also deserves credit for setting the tone in the Powerplay with four huge sixes.On a flat track offering true bounce, the Indian batsmen were in full flow, hammering a record 23 sixes. Samson’s nine maximums were just one shy of Varma’s 10.","India inflict 135-run defeat on South Africa in fourth and final T20I in Johannesburg. With this victory, India clinched the four-match series 3-1. Chasing a mammoth 284-run target, South Africa were rattled by pacer Arshdeep Singh's brilliance.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115343738,imgsize-114930,width-400,resizemode-4/115343738.jpg"

Mohammed Shami returns, India get boost ahead of Border-Gavaskar Trophy | BTB Highlights

KOLKATA: Much will depend on Mohammed Shami as the Bengal and Madhya Pradesh Elite Group ‘C’ Ranji Trophy match is set for a thrilling finish. Chasing 338 for victory, the hosts are placed well at 150 for three at stumps on the penultimate day of the match at the Holkar Stadium in Indore on Friday.Shami, who picked up one wicket later on in the day, actually made MP’s job a bit difficult with his bat in the morning. The pacer, who came in to bat when Bengal were 219/8, used his long handle well to stitch together a 39-run last-wicket stand with his brother Mohammed Kaif to take Bengal’s second innings total to 276.After a brief 18-run ninth-wicket stand with SS Jaiswal, Shami decided to break free. He hit two fours and lifted Kartikeya Singh and Kulwant Khejroliya for a six each over the long-on before being dismissed for 37 that came off just 36 deliveries.It was good to see him coming back to bowl 11 overs in the next two sessions of play. Shami’s comeback has already excited cricket watchers. Bengal coach Laxmi Ratan Shukla was happy to see how Shami took up the challenge.","Bengal and Madhya Pradesh Elite Group ‘C’ Ranji Trophy match is set for a thrilling finish.

In another blow to Team India ahead of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy , batter Shubman Gill has fractured his thumb while fielding in the slips during the match simulation in Perth on Saturday (November 16).A source close to the developments confirmed Gill’s injury and the severity of it after scans. The opening batter will remain in Australia but his inclusion for the first Test, starting November 22, is a big doubt now. The team management has expressed hope that he will recover in time for the second Test, which begins December 6.“Yes, Shubman Gill is injured and has fractured his thumb while fielding during the match simulation.

Backed by the team management, an Indian team in transition is winning matches by playing a brand of T20 cricket that is exhilarating to watch...

Suryakumar Yadav continues to make an impact as a leader | #BeyondTheBoundary

Things are looking up for Suryakumar Yadav and Co. heading into the next T20 World Cup , to be hosted by India and Sri Lanka in just over a year's time. The team has finished the year by winning 24 of 26 T20Is played in 2024, a very impressive run.Even after the exit of senior stalwarts Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli from the format, and despite the absence of match-winners like Rishabh Pant and Jasprit Bumrah , this T20 team is playing like champions.The most refreshing aspect of the team's journey post the T20 World title is the freedom with which they have expressed themselves, especially with the bat.""Everyone has a different skill set, and they also want to come out and express themselves. So freedom is very important when they get onto the field, which is what I try to give,"" Suryakumar had said at the start of the series, and his team has lived up to the philosophy.The freedom the team management has given to the players has meant that the Indian team has posted 200-above totals on six out of the eight occasions they batted first post the T20 World Cup.Two men who have immensely benefitted from the role clarity given to them are Sanju Samson and Tilak Varma . Asked to open the innings, Samson now holds the record for scoring the most T20 international tons (3) in a calendar year.Two of those hundreds resulted in India raking up their highest team totals in international cricket, 297/6 against Bangladesh in Hyderabad in October and 283/1 against South Africa in Johannesburg on Friday.In between, the Kerala wicketkeeper-batsman scored consecutive ducks in both Sri Lanka and South Africa. The team management has backed him and he has repaid them with interest.""In T20Is, I never thought of consistency. If there is a ball to be hit, it's necessary for me to capitalise on that. In the team, even our captain Surya, Gautam bhai, and Laxman sir emphasise maximising runs in the first innings. Even if I'm in the 90s, I aim to keep the momentum going,"" Samson said.Varma's attitude was even more refreshing. After making a comeback from injury, he scored 33 and 20 batting at No. 4. That's when the skipper offered the southpaw a chance to bat at No.3, and the Hyderabadi exploded with back-to-back hundreds.""The team backed us even when we flopped. They told us to play the brand of cricket the team is known for,"" Varma said.The big question now is how to fit in the likes of Samson and Varma when Jaiswal, Gill and Pant return. ""I haven't thought that far ahead. When they come back, we'll discuss it calmly. It will be tough, but it's a good headache,"" Suryakumar said.","India have won 24 of 26 T20Is played in 2024, a very impressive run.

No. 3 batter suffers hairline fracture

#BGT IND vs AUS: Ashwin unlikely to play before the 3rd Test | #BeyondTheBoundary

Rohit unlikely to travel for first Test

Opening options

No injury concerns for Rahul and Kohli

MUMBAI: Team India has suffered a significant setback just a week before the Border-Gavaskar Trophy opener. Shubman Gill , the team's No. 3 batter, sustained a left-thumb injury while fielding in the slips during match simulation in Perth on Saturday.TOI has learned that Gill is dealing with a hairline fracture on his thumb and has been ""ruled out"" of the first Test against Australia, starting November 22.""He hurt his thumb while fielding in the slips. He was sent for scans, and it seems he's suffering from a hairline fracture. He will miss the first Test due to the injury but should return for the second,"" a reliable BCCI source told TOI. Gill , who batted twice on Friday, scored 28 in his first outing before being caught at gully off Navdeep.The 25-year-old, who scored 90 and 1 in India's last Test against New Zealand in Mumbai (a series India lost 3-0), has valuable experience in Australian conditions, having performed well during India's previous tour Down Under.Gill's absence raises questions about who will take the crucial No 3 spot. In October, during the first Test against New Zealand in Bengaluru, Virat Kohli stepped into the position after Gill was sidelined with a stiff neck. Kohli scored 0 and 70 in that match, marking his return to the one-down slot after eight years.Another candidate for the slot is KL Rahul . Ahead of the Australia tour, India's head coach Gautam Gambhir praised Rahul's versatility, stating, ""Rahul can bat in the top order, he can bat at No. 3, he can play at No. 6. If needed, he can do the job for us.""Meanwhile, Indian captain Rohit Sharma is unlikely to fly to Perth for the first Test after he and his wife, Ritika Sajdeh, welcomed a baby boy on Friday night.""It seems like he wants to spend some time with his family before leaving for Australia for what will be a very long tour. Also, it takes time to adjust to the conditions in Australia, so there's no point in arriving at the 11th hour and playing a Test on a bouncy Perth pitch. Apparently, he has communicated to the BCCI that he will join the team before the second Test in Adelaide. There's a long gap between the first and second Tests, and it makes sense for him to play in the tour match at Canberra, starting Nov. 30, before the second Test,"" a source said.With Gill ruled out and Rohit likely unavailable for the first Test, the Indian team management and selectors may ask one of the India A players - Ruturaj Gaikwad, Sai Sudharsan, or Devdutt Padikkal - to stay back for the first Test. ""Ruturaj batted well in the match simulation at Perth today, and he's got an idea of the Aussie conditions by now. He can fit into the middle order, where he's batted in domestic cricket this season, easily. There's a possibility he may be asked to stay back,"" a source said.Sudharsan, who has played four white-ball matches for India and impressed in county cricket for Surrey, is yet to earn his maiden Test call-up. Padikkal, who debuted against England earlier in 2024 and scored a half-century (65), was excluded from the squad for this tour.Rahul, who was struck on the elbow by a delivery from Prasidh Krishna during practice, is doing fine. Virat Kohli, who also had a minor injury scare, was cleared after scans and was seen batting in the nets.",India's No. 3 batter Shubman Gill is ruled out of the first Test against Australia.

NEW DELHI: Australian skipper Alyssa Healy will miss the remaining Women's Big Bash League matches because of an injury to her left knee, which could affect her participation in the forthcoming ODI series against India.On Saturday, the Sydney Sixers announced that Healy would not continue in the tournament, noting that she had been managing a foot injury from the T20 World Cup in October.This setback raises concerns about Healy's availability for Australia's three ODI matches against India, scheduled to commence shortly after the WBBL concludes.The Australian captain will undergo medical evaluations over the next two weeks, with team selectors planning to announce the India series squad the following weekend.Whilst the injury is not expected to impact her participation in the Ashes series beginning January 12 in Sydney, the priority remains her recovery before the important India series and the subsequent three ODIs in New Zealand during the Christmas period.Previously this month, Healy had discussed the difficulties of managing her captaincy duties alongside her physical wellbeing.Should Healy not recover in time for the India series, Tahlia McGrath is expected to assume captaincy, a role she previously held during the T20 World Cup this year.",Alyssa Healy will miss the remaining Women's Big Bash League matches because of an injury to her left knee.

Points: Vidarbha 3, Gujarat: 1. Player of the match: Danish Malewar.

NAGPUR: In the end, it proved to be so near yet so far for Vidarbha . After slogging through Saturday, the former champions came agonisingly close to extending their winning run in this season of the Ranji Trophy . The last batting pair of Gujarat , though, remained unbeaten for 5.2 overs as the Elite Group 'B' clash ended in a dramatic draw at Jamtha.Day 4 started with Vidarbha batting for 30 minutes. They scored 33 runs in 4.4 overs; declared at 545 for 9 with skipper Akshay Wadkar unbeaten on 114 (162b;10x4;3x6). By the time the stumps were drawn, the hosts found that they had run out of time to force another win.At 4.09pm on Saturday, the umpires declared the start of the mandatory overs. The previous over, 68th of Gujarat’s second innings saw skipper Chintan Gaja scooping a half tracker from part-timer Atharva Taide to Harsh Dubey at mid-on. The wicket was Gujarat’s seventh; the score was 202, the mark at which the visitors had wiped out the innings deficit. It meant Vidarbha would need to bat again if they managed to wrap up Gujarat innings.With Gujarat No. 9 Swapnil Desai joining set batter Het Patel in the middle, the mandatory over period was full of drama. There were nerves all around as Vidarbha missed an easy run out chance. Nachiket Bhute failed to send in a good throw from close. Harsh Dubey at the non-striker end, failed to gather a throw that could have been collected.With main bowlers failing to provide the breakthrough, Wadkar, as a last throw of the dice, gave the ball to another part-timer, Karun Nair . The gamble paid off big time. Nair picked up two wickets on successive balls of his first over, inning's 76th. Nair's first FC wicket in seven years included that of well-set Het Patel (77;129b;10x4;1x6), as Gujarat slid to 217 for 9.With Gujarat leading by just 15 runs with just one wicket in hand, Vidarbha had a chance. But the beneficiary of the earlier Bhute-Dubey slip-up, Desai, remained unbeaten for 42 balls. Desai along with No. 11 Tejas Patel batted for 5.2 overs to snatch a draw from the jaws of defeat for Gujarat.While Gujarat ended on a defiant note, the start of their reply was a shaky one. Medium pacer Aditya Thakare (3-26) sent back both the openers — Priyank Panchal and Aarya Desai — with the score on 14 by 5.3 overs. The foundation for Gujarat's draw was laid by Umnag Kumar (50;88b;3x4;2x6) and Het Patel.",Aditya Thakare took three wickets on Day 4. Vidarbha batting for 30 minutes before declaring at 545 for 9.

However, his career faced significant scrutiny due to two high-profile blunders, at the Gabba in 2003 and Eden Gardens in 2005, involving Indian cricket icon.Tendulkar posted an image of three trees, resembling big wickets, on social media platform X, formerly Twitter, asking his fans, ""Can you guess which umpire made the stumps feel this big?""And soon the post became viral as the legend's fans started sending replies on the post naming Bucknor.""10 years of retirement but not taking the names clearly to demean someone . The gentleman.""""None other than Steve Bucknor the umpire and Mike Denness the Match Referee, the lethal combination who always did their best to get you!""""The GOD of Cricket is in the Roasting Mood today!""""This is exactly how the Steve Bucknor would be thinking about the stumps while giving you out LBW.""The decisions made by Bucknor during those two crucial matches sparked significant outrage among fans and led to widespread criticism, despite Bucknor being regarded as one of the best umpires of his time.In the 2003 Test between India and Australia at the Gabba, Bucknor controversially gave Sachin Tendulkar out LBW off Jason Gillespie, despite TV replays showing the ball would have gone over the stumps. This error was a major talking point as it denied Tendulkar a chance to continue his innings.The second high-profile mistake came in 2005 during a Test against Pakistan at Eden Gardens. Tendulkar was given out caught behind off Abdul Razzaq, despite no contact with the ball.The delivery, which swung away from Tendulkar, ended a promising innings and shifted the match's momentum. Both incidents have remained significant moments of debate in cricket history , cementing Bucknor’s legacy for his contentious decisions.","Sachin Tendulkar’s social media post on Saturday has gone viral in no time.

'Good fun'

Netherlands outclassed Hungary with a 4-0 victory in their winner-takes-all Nations League encounter on Saturday while record-setting Germany hammered Bosnia and Hercegovina 7-0.Netherlands and Hungary went into the match tied on five points each and with the winner set to join Germany in ensuring their progress from Group A3 to the quarter-finals.First-half penalties by Wout Weghorst and Cody Gakpo sent the Oranje on their way, before Denzel Dumfries and Teun Koopmeiners made the game safe in the second period.""There are always things we can improve upon,"" Dutch captain Virgil van Dijk told SBS6. ""But in the end, we deserved to win.""The match at the Johan Cruyff Arena was briefly interrupted in the seventh minute following a medical emergency on the Hungarian bench.The referee stopped play for some 10 minutes while Hungary's assistant coach Adam Szalai received treatment, shielded from view by huddled players and staff members, as well as a large white sheet.Szalai, 36, was stretchered off to applause from spectators and players alike, the Hungarian FA later released a statement saying he was ""conscious"" and in a ""stable condition"" at an Amsterdam hospital.""It was a scare of course,"" Gakpo told NOS. ""Fortunately, I just heard he regained consciousness on the pitch. Things like this are more important than football.""Almost forgotten in the aftermath of the worrying incident was the handball by Tamas Nikitscher as the ball was crossed into the Hungarian box.The referee consulted the touchline video monitor and promptly restarted play by pointing to the spot, allowing Weghorst to sweep the Netherlands in front.Denes Dibusz was the busier of the two goalkeepers as the first period wore on and had to be alert to keep out efforts from Tijjani Reijnders and Donyell Malen.In the 11th minute of added time, Dutch dominance told and Malen was clipped by Zsolt Nagy in the box.Gakpo dispatched the resulting spot-kick, sending Dibusz the wrong way and Netherlands into a two-goal lead.Right-back Dumfries sealed the Netherlands' spot in the quarters as he latched onto Malen's flick-on at the back post and fizzed a volley back into the far corner shortly after the hour.Koopmeiners marked his first international match since 2022 by nodding in a fourth in the 86th minute.Germany cemented their spot at the top of the group with a 7-0 win over Bosnia -- the heaviest in the six-year history of the Nations League.""It was good fun tonight. After a couple of goals we did the work defensively and then everything came together offensively. The more that happens, the more fun we have on the pitch,"" German attacker Jamal Musiala told UEFA's website.Musiala opened the floodgates after two minutes with a header from Joshua Kimmich 's cross.Tim Kleindienst scored his first goal for Germany in the 23rd minute and Kai Havertz made the game safe eight minutes before the break, slotting home after a slick one-two with Florian Wirtz.Wirtz then made it four on 50 minutes with a sublime swerving free-kick from wide on the left, before doubling up seven minutes later.""Seeing Flo (Wirtz's) free-kick was kind of nice but just in general everyone played well, had good moments. We're just playing good football,"" added Musiala.Substitute Leroy Sane scored Germany's sixth in the 66th minute and Kleindienst completed the rout just over 10 minutes from time as he guided home a pinpoint cross from centre-half Antonio Rudiger.The emphatic result leaves Germany five points ahead of Netherlands with only one match left to play.In Group B1, Georgia played out a 1-1 draw at home to Ukraine and stay two points ahead of the fourth-placed visitors.The Czech Republic drew 0-0 in Albania and remain top of the group on eight points, one ahead of Georgia in second and their third-placed opponents.Turkey stayed top of Group B4 with a 0-0 draw at home to Wales, while Iceland beat Montenegro 2-0.Turkey were presented with a golden opportunity to grow their two-point lead over Wales but Kerem Akturkoglu sent his 89th-minute penalty wide.","Netherlands beat Hungary 4-0 in winner-takes-all Nations League encounter.

NEW DELHI: Football legend Cristiano Ronaldo has hinted at potential retirement plans, saying he might step away from football in ""a year or two"" but remains undecided.Speaking after Portugal's emphatic 5-1 victory over Poland in the UEFA Nations League on Friday, Ronaldo shared, “I just want to enjoy the game. My plan for retirement? If it happens, it will be in a year or two... But I don’t know. I’ll be 40 soon, and I want to enjoy this moment while I still feel motivated. As soon as the motivation is gone, I’ll walk away.”The iconic forward, who turns 40 in February next year, delivered a masterclass in Porto, scoring twice to secure Portugal's place in the quarterfinals.Ronaldo's performance flourished once again in the national colours, as he netted his 134th international goal with a penalty and later added a spectacular overhead kick to bring his tally to 135.Portugal took time to break through Poland’s defence, but a second-half flurry sealed the win.Rafael Leão opened the scoring with a well-placed header, followed by Ronaldo’s composed penalty.Bruno Fernandes then unleashed a stunning long-range strike before Ronaldo set up Pedro Neto for the fourth goal.Ronaldo’s acrobatic finish in the final minutes added an exclamation point to the night.Although Poland's Dominik Marczuk scored a consolation goal, the defeat ended Poland’s quarterfinal hopes.For Portugal, the result ensured not only a spot in the last eight but also placement in Pot 1 for the 2026 World Cup qualifying draw.As Ronaldo contemplates his footballing future, his performance against Poland reaffirms his status as a living legend. Whether he retires soon or extends his illustrious career, Ronaldo’s impact on the game remains indelible.","Cristiano Ronaldo says he might retire in ""a year or two"" but remains undecided.

Spain roll on

PARIS: Cristiano Ronaldo scored twice as Portugal thrashed Poland 5-1 thanks to a rampant second-half display on Friday to reach the Nations League quarterfinals, while already-qualified Spain beat Denmark.Roberto Martinez's Portugal wrapped up top spot in Group A1 with a game to spare, securing their place in the next round in March.France, Germany and Italy are also already through to the last eight.Poland were the better side early on but failed to take their chances in Porto and the home side made them pay, netting four times in the last 20 minutes.""We couldn't impose ourselves on the game in the first half,"" said Portugal goalscorer Rafael Leao. ""(Coach) Roberto Martinez's approach in the locker room was important; it was the key to changing the pressure at half-time.""Ronaldo volleyed over from close range shortly before the interval, as Portugal failed to register a shot on target in the first half.Dominik Marczuk almost broke the deadlock in the 58th minute, but Portugal goalkeeper Diogo Costa produced a brilliant fingertip save to deny him.The hosts broke from the resulting corner to score less than 60 seconds later, as Leao powered forward before finding Nuno Mendes, then continuing his run to meet the Paris Saint-Germain full-back's cross with a powerful header.Portugal were awarded a penalty when Diogo Dalot's strike flicked off Jakub Kiwior's hand at point-blank range and was saved by Marcin Bulka.Ronaldo stepped up to dink home a 'Panenka' spot-kick.That goal ended any hopes Poland had of staging a comeback and Fernandes added a third for Portugal with 10 minutes left, crashing the ball in off the crossbar from just outside the box.Pedro Neto also got on the scoresheet, collecting Ronaldo's pass and rifling past Bulka at his near post.There was still time for Ronaldo to double his tally and move onto 135 international goals, acrobatically volleying home Vitinha's cross from close range in the 87th minute.Marczuk drilled in a consolation for Poland, but they can no longer qualify for the knock-out stages and will be relegated if they lose to Scotland next week.In the other match in the group, Scotland gave their hopes of avoiding the drop a massive boost as John McGinn scored a late winner in a 1-0 victory over 10-man Croatia.Petar Sucic was sent off in the first half, but Croatia almost hung on for the point they needed to qualify with Portugal, only for McGinn to strike in the 86th minute.European champions Spain stayed unbeaten in Group A4 with a 2-1 win over Denmark in Copenhagen.Luis de la Fuente's visitors started strongly and went close to a 13th-minute opener when the in-form Ayoze Perez rattled the crossbar.Spain took an early lead after Denmark carelessly gave the ball away on the edge of their own box.Perez played in Mikel Oyarzabal who took an excellent first touch and slipped the ball past goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel and in at the near post.Villarreal forward Perez, who only made his international debut in June, doubled Spain's advantage with a low, left-footed finish into the bottom corner after being picked out by Dani Olmo.Gustav Isaksen pulled one back for Denmark late on, pouncing on a terrible mix-up between Fabian Ruiz and 'keeper David Raya.""A very, very happy night for me (with a goal and an assist), but the most important thing is going through top of the group,"" Perez told uefa.com.The other game in Group A4 saw Switzerland relegated by Aleksa Terzic's late equaliser in a 1-1 draw with Serbia.Romania's Group C2 game against Kosovo in Bucharest was suspended in injury time and then abandoned with the game goalless after the visiting players walked off the pitch following chants of ""Serbia"" from the home fans.""The UEFA Nations League match between Romania and Kosovo has been abandoned. UEFA will communicate further information in due course,"" said governing body UEFA on its website.In League D, San Marino kept their hopes of an unlikely promotion alive as Nicola Nanni scored an injury-time penalty to grab a 1-1 draw with Gibraltar.",Cristiano Ronaldo scores twice as Portugal thrash Poland 5-1.

Choosing 22 players from 580 in a space of a few days was the biggest challenge, says coach Nallappan Mohanraj

CHENNAI: The men’s football scene in Tamil Nadu has been far from ideal in the last six years. With the non-conduct of the CFA leagues since 2018 due to the long-standing dispute between the Tamil Nadu Football Association (TFA) and Chennai Football Association (CFA) – they were hosted without recognition in 2022 – the local players have been struggling for game time.In a bid to sustain their careers and make a living out of the sport, many TN footballers have been forced to ply their trade in other state leagues. The grim situation has severely impacted TN’s performances in the Santosh Trophy (National Championship), where the state team has been a mere participant in the last few years.Not much has changed in TN football in recent times, but newly-appointed head coach Nallappan Mohanraj is optimistic about restoring pride in the upcoming Santosh Trophy. TN have been pitted alongside Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Andhra Pradesh and 2022-23 champs Karnataka in Group G and will play their pool matches in Anantapur from Friday to Tuesday. As only one team will qualify from the group for the final round, the competition is going to be tough.""I played in the Santosh Trophy as a youngster and captained the team as well. Being with TN in my first assignment as a head coach is something memorable. I love being put in tough situations; staying comfortable makes me uncomfortable. I have always wanted to do something good while being put in a tough situation,"" Mohanraj, a former India defender, told TOI.""I had to assess about 580 players in just three days of the trials, so I do not know if they were able to show their full potential in the little time they got. I might have missed out on picking a promising player. I do not know when these players (22 members in the final squad) last played 90 minutes in a match, so I had to decide which aspect I needed to give more importance to – fitness or tactics. It has been a huge challenge, but I have been trying to find solutions,"" said Mohanraj, who had worked with the India U-23 and U-20 teams.Mohanraj can rely on the experience of Ajith Kumar, Lijo Francis, B Sriram, Sinivasan Pandiyan and Alexander Romario Jesuraj, players who have competed in the top-two tiers of Indian football . ""I hardly had 10 days to work with the group. Adding experience while building a team is important; that is why I have opted to have at least one senior player in every area of the pitch. There has to be a good balance between youth and experience,"" added Mohanraj.Despite not having the best of build-ups, the chief coach is focused on the target. ""Our goal is to take TN to the final round. We did not have time to implement my philosophy, so I did not want to complicate our tactics. The boys know what I expect from them. I want them to do the basics right.""","Choosing 22 players from 580 in a space of a few days was the biggest challenge, says coach Nallappan Mohanraj.

KOLKATA: On Oct. 13, when Bengal was preparing to bid farewell to Maa Durga, Sanjoy Sen began his new journey.A total of 78 players assembled at the Salt Lake Stadium. And so commenced the selection trial for Bengal’s Santosh Trophy squad under the watchful eyes of coach Sen. Over the past few days, they were made to go through the grind and play four practice matches, including the one against I-League team Inter Kashi, before Sen picked his final 22 for the tournament.""When I watch a game — be it a match from ISL or I-League or any other tournament — I have this habit of taking note of the performance of any good player and keeping their names in my notebook. This has been my longtime practice. And this has helped me settle down on my final squad for Santosh Trophy also,"" Sen told TOI on Thursday.""Besides, I've collected data of some players from people and coaches who have been directly involved in teams playing in the CFL. They have also helped me pick my players. Robi Hansda, Israfil Dewan, Ayon Mondal and Aritra Ghosh — they all have proved their worth in the CFL. Overall, in my opinion they are the best of the lot.

The two other teams of the group — Bihar and Uttar Pradesh — will also square off on the same day.The most successful team in the Santosh Trophy history with 32 titles, Bengal have not won it since the 2016-17 season. It was the time when Sen had been scaling new heights in Indian club football, having guided Mohun Bagan to their maiden I-League title and a Federation Cup to boot.""I'm not an expert in assessing why we have fallen behind in Indian football. I'm not a person who wants to live in the past. Maybe, at that time players from Mohun Bagan, East Bengal and Mohammedan SC used to play for Bengal. From Latifuddin to Md Akbar and Xavier Pias they all played for Bengal in the Santosh Trophy and helped Bengali players grow as a whole. Now these three teams no longer allow their players to take part in the tournament. So, the present can't be judged in the light of what has happened in the past,"" said Sen, who has also managed Mohammedan Sporting and United SC in the I-League and served now defunct ATK as its head of youth development.""Moreover, when we used to rule Indian football, the game was limited to Bengal, Kerala, Goa, Punjab and Services. Now, 38 teams are playing in the Santosh Trophy this year. The game has expanded and it offers a more level-playing field,"" he remarked.A daily routine chart for the players hangs up on the wall of the dining room. Each morning it is shared with them on the specially-opened WhatsApp group. ""They must know what I want from them. Following everything in a disciplined way is a must in my scheme of things,"" he put it.Sen would also often sit with them, dissecting their performances in the practice match against Inter Kashi. Mohun Bagan SG's ISL Shield-winning coach Antonio Lopez Habas, now serving the Varanasi-based team as a technical director, spoke highly of Sen's brigade after the match which Kashi won 2-0.Working a little away from the media glare and with the challenge of helping Bengal return to their days lost glory in Santosh Trophy for the first time in his 27-year-old coaching career, does he have a point to prove? Is there any self-motivating factor?""In our time, representing Bengal was itself an honour. But the players now know that unless they become champions or runners-up, they will not be noticed. This is their motivation and they are hungry to reach that stage. It's a collective mission. I'm here as a catalyst, helping my players fuel that dream,"" Sen pointed out, his stiff jaw betraying a sense of determination.And any personal objective?""My dream? I've not thought about this, honestly speaking. I've trained the Indian junior team. And just like Manolo Marquez, I too applied for the Indian senior coach's job. If there's any dream, maybe it's there... If it doesn't happen, well, it will leave me with no regrets.""Sen signed off, got up and with a whistle in his mouth, began his training session with the players at the Kalyani stadium.","Bengal begin their group-stage campaign with a game against Jharkhand on Saturday.

NEW DELHI: The Nations League match between France and Israel at the Stade de France on Thursday was overshadowed by tensions surrounding the ongoing conflict in Gaza.Despite the deployment of 4,000 security personnel, there were instances of booing during the Israeli national anthem and minor scuffles inside the stadium.The attendance of 16,611 was the lowest for the French national team at the Stade de France since its opening in 1998, with many fans opting to stay away due to security concerns.The sparse crowd was a reflection of the frictions surrounding the match, which took place against the backdrop of the Gaza war.While some Israeli fans defied their government's warning against travelling for sports events, anti-Israeli demonstrators gathered outside the stadium, waving Palestinian flags and protesting against the match.The protesters carried banners condemning the Gaza offensive, with one reading, ""We don't play with genocide.""Despite the tensions, the match proceeded without major incidents, ending in a goalless draw.Watch:French President Emmanuel Macron attended the game as a show of solidarity, emphasizing the need to combat anti-Semitism and violence.""We will not give into anti-Semitism anywhere and violence, including in France, will never prevail, nor will intimidation,"" he told France's BFM TV ahead of kickoff.The match highlighted the broader societal issues surrounding the Gaza conflict, with racism and intolerance on the rise in France and other parts of Europe.The clashes between Maccabi Tel Aviv fans and local groups in Amsterdam the previous week further underscored the potential for tensions to spill over into the sporting arena.While the match itself was a symbolic gesture of normalcy, the surrounding events and low attendance reflected the complex dynamics at play, with the Gaza conflict casting a long shadow over the sporting encounter.","The Nations League match between France and Israel at the Stade de France on Thursday was overshadowed by tensions.

NEW DELHI: France national team coach Didier Deschamps has shed light on the reasons behind Kylian Mbappé 's recent struggles and his exclusion from the squad for the upcoming Nations League matches against Israel and Italy.According to Deschamps, Mbappé's dip in form can be attributed to both physical and psychological factors.Deschamps acknowledged that Mbappé is going through a challenging period in his career, describing it as ""not the happiest.""While Mbappé expressed a desire to join the national team, Deschamps believes it is better for the striker to take a break at the moment.“It's a fact that he is in a difficult situation,” Deschamps told broadcaster TF1. “Obviously, he is going through a period which is not the happiest of his career.”“He wanted to come,” Deschamps added. “I think it's better for him (not to be selected) at the moment. Everybody can go through a difficult period. There is a physical element, and a psychological one.”Since joining Real Madrid from Paris Saint-Germain during the summer transfer window, Mbappé's performances have been below his usual high standards.He has scored only one goal in his last seven club appearances and has not added to his tally of 48 goals for the French national team since June.Deschamps clarified that Mbappé's exclusion from the squad is not related to recent reports in Swedish media alleging that the striker is the subject of a rape investigation in Stockholm.Mbappé's representatives have vehemently denied these reports, labelling them as ""false and irresponsible.""While Deschamps did not provide specific details about Mbappé's situation, his comments highlight the importance of addressing both the physical and mental aspects of an athlete's well-being.It is evident that the France coach is taking a cautious approach, allowing Mbappé time to regain his form and confidence before rejoining the national team setup.","France coach Didier Deschamps has shed light on the reasons behind Kylian Mbappé's recent struggles and his exclusion from the squad for the upcoming Nations League matches against Israel and Italy.

Spanish superstar Rafael Nadal is aiming to cap his emotional farewell from tennis with another Davis Cup triumph in Malaga next week.Nadal, 38, has battled injuries over the past few years and the extent to which he can compete for his country is unknown, but all eyes will be on the 22-time Grand Slam winner.The veteran led Spain to victory in Madrid five years ago -- the last time they won the trophy and Nadal's fourth.However, he admitted Saturday that his role in Malaga may be limited to doubles rather than singles.""First off, we'll have to see how I feel in training and, if I really don't feel I have a chance to win the singles, I'll be the first to not want to play,"" Nadal said in comments to the Spanish Tennis Federation (RFET).""If I don't feel ready, I'll be the first to speak to the captain (David Ferrer). I've already told him on a few occasions not to make any decisions based on the fact that it's my last week as a professional tennis player.""French Open and Wimbledon champion Carlos Alcaraz will be Spain's leading player and his presence offers Nadal a real chance of retiring on a high note.""Probably one of the most special tournaments that I'm going to play.

They played amazing in doubles, so it was a really stressful match. But in the end, I'm grateful that we did it as a team,"" Paolini stated after their doubles success.""This year I'm a little bit used to it,"" the 28-year-old added when asked about playing singles and doubles back-to-back.

BENGALURU: Prajnesh Gunneswaran climbed to a career-best No.75 on the ATP Rankings five years ago, in what was his second innings in tennis.The 35-year-old, forced to listen to the rickety tunes of a creaking frame, particularly a troublesome left wrist, bid adieu to the sport on Friday. Gunneswaran made the announcement on social media, some 20-months after he played his last tournament, an ATP Challenger in Pune.The gifted left-hander said, ""I played without being able to up my intensity for a while, managing the injury, but my ranking kept dropping. The more I played, the more sure I became that I didn’t want to do this in-between thing, where I was unable to raise the intensity of my play.""Gunneswaran celebrated his 35th birthday on Tuesday. ""It was not a decision I made overnight,"" he said. ""I always knew that when I decided to go, I didn’t want to leave with regrets. That’s why I took so much time before making the decision.""The Chennai-based pro’s tennis journey has played out in two parts. Gunneswaran was ranked outside the 1500-mark at the age of 26. A series of injuries – recurring stress fracture of both knees – kept him on the sidelines. When relatively pain-free, Gunneswaran decided to get back on the road for a last dance. His father, the late SG Prabhakaran, whose deep pockets allowed his only child to return to the Tour, was his biggest cheerleader. Gunneswaran’s knees held. He played one season, tried another and then another.

He started by qualifying for the main draw of the Australian Open and went on to play the main draw of the other three majors, besides making the round of 32 in Indian wells, beating the 18th ranked Nikolas Basilashvili enroute, for his best win by way of rankings. His other top-50 triumph came against Denis Shapovalov (ranked 23 at the time).Gunneswaran has no definite plans for the future but is sure he will be involved with tennis. ""All of us who have made it to this level, have had to shift out of the country to train,"" said Gunneswaran.""Every program we’ve had in this country has had some success, from BATT -- Leander Paes and Somdev Devvarman – to the other ventures. We need to do something on a big scale, so that our players do not have to go outside to train,"" he said. ""China and Japan have been doing it for a while.

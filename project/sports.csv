D Gukesh vs Ding Liren: World Chess Championship on razor's edge with two games to play,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/chess/d-gukesh-vs-ding-liren-world-chess-championship-on-razors-edge-with-two-games-to-play/articleshow/116194534.cms,"Ding Liren and D Gukesh after Game 12 (Photo: Maria Emelianova for FIDE)

Last two games when scores are equal (since 2000)

Summary:

Is losing five games too many?

0-1, 1-1, 2-1, 2-2

Strike back in next game after trailing WCC matches since 1995

Summary:

The World Chess Championship (WCC) stands at a tantalizing juncture. A series of seven consecutive draws in the middle games between world champion Diren Ling of China and his Indian challenger D Gukesh , may have lulled the casual observer into thinking that this duel was seriously lacking in excitement and aggression. But the experts have been continuously pointing out over the past fortnight that there is much that lies beneath.While they have conceded that this is arguably the most human of all title matches in the classical format, there still lurks the unknown, though the pattern does point out to Ding drawing Gukesh towards his favoured tiebreaks ‘endgame’.As things stand, with two games remaining, how Gukesh extracts himself from this web and emerges in those prodigious colours that was so expected of him will be foremost on Indian fans’ minds. Remember, if scores remain level after 14 games (either through draws or one win for each player), the match goes to rapid tiebreaks scheduled on Friday.Will the players remain ultracautious in the final two classical games on Wednesday (Gukesh gets white) and Thursday (Ding white)? Because one slip could decide the match. Who will manage nerves better in tiebreaks? There are more questions than answers as we head to the climax in this cerebral war between the Chinese emperor and the Indian prince.Do the past trends in WCC Matches provide an answer? TOI takes a look…2006: 2-2. Last two games drawn. Kramnik beat Topalov in tiebreaks.2010: 2-2. Game 11 drawn. Anand beat Topalov in Game 12 with black and retained the title.2012: 1-1. Both draws. Anand beat Gelfand via tiebreaks.2016: 1-1. Both draws. Carlsen beat Karjakin via tiebreaks.2018: 0-0. Both draws. Carlsen beat Caruana via tiebreaks.2023: 3-3. Both draws. Ding beat Nepo via stiebreaks.Only Anand-Topalov match saw a decisive result. Other matches went to tiebreaks.In the 2000, 2004, 2008, 2013, 2014 and 2021 matches, either the scores were not level before the last two games or the matches got over with one or more classical games to spare.Though Ding Liren has bounced back, he has already lost five games in his WCC career so far – three against Nepo last year and two against Gukesh (third and 11th game) in the ongoing match. Both world champions before Magnus Carlsen (since 2000), had to vacate their crowns once they lost five games in their WCC careers. Carlsen lost only two of 56 WCC games and forfeited his right to play last year.Kramnik: After dethroning Kasparov without losing a game in 2000, Kramnik lost two games against Leko in the winning campaign of 2004. And when he suffered his third loss against Anand in Bonn (2008), his days with the crown were numbered.Anand: Having lost one game each against Kramnik in 2008 and Gelfand in 2012, besides two against Topalov in 2010, Anand lost his fifth WCC game against Carlsen in their fifth game in Chennai (2013). He trailed 0-1 and never recovered, eventually losing the match 0-3 with two games to spare. In other words, if Ding manages to retain his crown, he will be the first player to do so despite losing five career games in world championships since 2000.The scoreline through four decisive games for Gukesh as he trailed after the first game, equalised in the third game, led after the 11th and was forced to draw level after the 12th. Only Anand (vs Topalov in 2010), Leko (vs Kramnik in 2004) and Kasparov (vs Karpov 1985) have experienced such a sequence in the last 60 years of WCC match history. Anand and Kasparov went on to win while Kramnik retained the title being the defending champion as there was no provision of tiebreaks then.1995: Anand wins G9, Kasparov G10.2006: Topalov G9, Kramnik G10.2010: Topalov wins G1, Anand G22012: Gelfand G7, Anand G82014: Carlsen G2, Anand G32023: Nepo wins G5, Ding G62024: Gukesh G11, Ding G12(All above wins were via white pieces)Except for Anand in 2014, the player who struck back immediately went on to win the match.",The World Chess Championship (WCC) stands at a tantalizing juncture. A series of seven consecutive draws in the middle games may have lulled the casual observer into thinking that this duel was seriously lacking in excitement and aggression. But the experts have been continuously pointing out over the past fortnight that there is much that lies beneath.

His explosive knock provided crucial momentum to the innings. David Miller was the standout performer with the bat, hammering a blistering 82 off 40 balls.

An Indian fan was forced to leave the stadium during the second Test between India and Australia at the Adelaide Oval for showing a piece of ' sandpaper ' while sitting in the stands, trying to remind of the infamous scandal that rocked Australian cricket during their 2018 tour of South Africa.In a video that has gone viral on the internet, the fan could be seen forcibly ejected from the venue by the security officials while he kept waving the sandpaper amid mixed reactions of cheers and jeers.The fan was trying to remind the Australians in the crowd about the controversey six years ago, which saw greats like the then captain Steve Smith and his deputy David Warner getting banned, along with teammate Cameron Bancroft.Bancroft was caught on camera, using a piece of sandpaper while trying to alter the condition of the ball during the third Test in Cape Town. It later came to light that the act was done while being in the knowledge of Smith and Warner.While Bancroft received a nine-month suspension, Smith and Warner were banned for a year each.Meanwhile, India, who entered the pink-ball Test in Adelaide after winning the opening match of the series in Perth, lost the game by 10 wickets, which let the Aussies level the series at 1-1.The third Test begins in Brisbane on December 14.","An Indian fan was forced to leave the stadium during the second Test between India and Australia at the Adelaide Oval.

How can India still qualify for World Test Championship final?

NEW DELHI: Legendary West Indian pacer Andy Roberts has advised Virat Kohli to focus on Test cricket to regain form ahead of the third Test, starting on December 14 in Brisbane .Roberts, known for his straightforward views, remarked, ""get your batting right,"" urging the Indian star to prioritise the traditional format of the game.Kohli, regarded as one of the finest batters of his generation, has been struggling with his form in recent times.Since January 2020, Kohli's batting has scored 1,961 runs across 64 innings, maintaining an average of 32.14. During this period, the 36-year-old managed to score three centuries and nine half-centuries.Roberts, in his conversation with Mid-Day, offered a broader perspective to Kohli, who effectively silenced his critics by scoring his 81st international century in Perth. The remarkable achievement, his first Test hundred after a gap of 16 months, contributed significantly to India's historic victory with a margin of 295 runs.Roberts believes Test cricket offers Kohli the platform to regain his lost focus, emphasising the importance of red-ball cricket in shaping a player’s legacy.""I don’t know if there will be a revival after the Adelaide defeat, but get your batting right. One of your best batsmen of all-time has been struggling for the last five years,” he said referring to Kohli.“He needs to be focused on the longer version of the game. You will get runs and score heavily in Test cricket only when you are fully focused on the longer form. The standard of Test cricket is not the same. The top batsmen look as if they are struggling.”","Legendary West Indian pacer Andy Roberts has advised Virat Kohli to focus on Test cricket to regain form ahead of the third Test, starting on December 14 in Brisbane.

IND vs AUS: India batting has been a major cause of worry

IND vs AUS: Rohit Sharma has had a terrible time with the bat in whites

How can India still qualify for World Test Championship final?

ADELAIDE: The manner of India’s capitulation in the second Test has left them facing many questions, but the immediate need is to address the balance of the fast-bowling lineup.With the frontline batters more or less picking themselves, additional pace reinforcements could be uppermost on India’s mind going into the third Test. If it is a typically fast and furious, seaming Gabba surface, Jasprit Bumrah will cover up for some of the others. But what if the surface is flatter? Will it be another case of the team being too reliant on Bumrah, like in Adelaide? Will India then need a stronger third, or even fourth seamer?The question would have been playing on the minds of captain Rohit Sharma and coach Gautam Gambhir when the team returned to the site of the carnage, the Adelaide Oval, for a morning nets session here on Tuesday. This time, the red Kookaburra replaced the pink ball, a move likely to have been a welcome relief for many of the batters.Some all-too-familiar scenes played out.Rohit Sharma looked scratchy. Virat Kohli continued to work on his backfoot play. Shubman Gill and Yashasvi Jaiswal put in the hard yards. Bumrah and Mohammed Siraj, while present, chose to indulge in some ‘workload management’ and put in time at the gym instead. And Akash Deep continued to trouble all the top batters.Since preparations began for the second Test, Akash Deep has looked the most penetrative of the second rung of pacers during training, drawing praise from the likes of Kohli at the nets.Harshit Rana 's explosive Perth debut, of course, ensured he would walk into the XI in Adelaide. Disappointingly, Rana was largely listless in the pink-ball Test. Without regular inroads from Bumrah and Siraj, the pressure and inexperience showed.Rana’s lengths and pace were off. He was often easy pickings for the likes of Travis Head and to a lesser extent, Marnus Labuschagne. Mohammed Shami, remember, is not around yet.If the team persists with a specialist spinner in Ravichandran Ashwin or even Washington Sundar , how can they fit Akash Deep in without taking away some of the side’s batting depth? There’s also Prasidh Krishna, who wheeled away at the nets on Tuesday, waiting in the wings.One way would be to swap Rana for Akash Deep, but it’s not an easy choice to make. The team has backed Rana and it would be unfair to dump him after just his second Test. Rana was more impressive in the warm-up game against the PM XI as well, taking 4/44 from 6 overs, and in Perth he got rid of the dangerous Head and toppled the tail in the first innings.Akash Deep has more first-class experience but is a largely unknown quantity on foreign soil, having played only the India A-South Africa A game in Benoni a year earlier and come away wicketless. Rohit suggested as much after the Adelaide defeat, saying, “That option is always there (swapping Rana for Akash Deep). All the bowlers who are here are capable of walking into the side. But how could I drop Rana when he had done nothing wrong in his debut Test? He gave crucial breakthroughs.”If India do decide they need four frontline pacers at the Gabba, that would mean including both Rana and Deep. In that scenario, can they drop their lone spinner and go with an all-pace lineup? That too is a difficult decision to make, since apart from depriving the attack of variation it might also take away from the notional batting depth, given that both Ashwin or Sundar are credible batters in their own right. The exclusion of the lone spinner could hurt India in case of another top and middle-order collapse.The other option is scarier still, if India can stop obsessing over a seam-bowling allrounder. Latest sensation Nitish Kumar Reddy has made a stellar impact with the bat, his lower-order cameos adding crucial runs to the board in quick time. However, he has not been as penetrative as a fourth seamer as, say, Shardul Thakur was. He may not even be the fourth seamer the team needs in Brisbane .In Perth, Reddy contributed a crucial 41 as India folded for 150 in their first innings, but was required for only three overs when Australia batted, more to give the likes of Bumrah, Siraj and Rana a break. In the second innings too, he bowled only a notional four overs, though he got the wicket of Mitchell Marsh.In Adelaide, Rohit needed the services of a proper fourth seamer in Australia’s first innings, but Reddy bowled only six overs, though he did get Marnus Labuschagne out before being taken off. Marsh plays a similar fill-in role for the Aussies as fourth seamer, but it can be argued their main three pacers are far, far more penetrative and they are not over-reliant on just one bowler.What can turn out to be important for the team is the 163 runs Nitish has scored on this tour at 54.33 and a strike rate of 87.16. Most of his cameos have come with India in deep, deep trouble. With some veteran batters struggling for form, Nitish’s presence with the bat is crucial. The 14 overs he has bowled for two wickets at a strike rate of 42 is incidental.Given the fragility of the batting, there are no easy choices for India to make when it comes to settling on their pace lineup for Brisbane. Only one thing is clear — without runs from the top and middle order, no amount of tinkering with the bowling lineup will be of any help.",Harshit Rana was largely listless in the pink-ball Test.

NEW DELHI: Former India cricketer Mohammad Kaif sees Rohit Sharma under pressure as he now has the twin task -- to score runs as batter and use Jasprit Bumrah carefully as skipper -- going forward in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy .While Rohit flopped with the bat in the second game in Adelaide, scoring 3 and 6 in two innings, the skipper also faced a Bumrah injury scare as on the second day, Bumrah was seen in trouble while bowling.Amid a horrible show from the batters in both innings, the Bumrah injury came as a big scare but bowling coach Morne Morkel later assured that it was just a cramp.With no Mohammed Shami and an inexperienced bowling attack, Kaif feels that Rohit will have to be extra careful in using Bumrah while focussing on his own form with the bat.Rohit has been going through a rough patch with the bat as he has scored 8 single-digit scores in the last six Tests.After missing the Perth Test due to personal reasons, which India won by 295 runs, Rohit returned in the XI for the second Test and under him, the team lost the contest by 10 wickets.With the series now level at 1-1, Rohit now is in a tricky spot as India have to win the remaining three games Down Under to make it to the WTC Final on their own.",Rohit Sharma has been going through a rough patch with the bat as he has scored 8 single-digit scores in the last six Tests.

Azam Khan gears up for 'tough' ILT20 Season 3 with power-hitting promise

Is India's batting now over dependent on Yashasvi Jaiswal?

NEW DELHI: Former Pakistan captain Sarfaraz Ahmed has addressed speculation about his international cricket future, stating that retiring would be his 'personal decision'.The experienced wicketkeeper-batter, currently mentoring the Dolphins team in the Champions T20 Cup , recently spoke about his future. As quoted from Geo News, ""Look, as far as my career is concerned. I think I don't need to say anything. Nothing is left. I know what you are waiting for, and it will happen soon.""These comments led to widespread speculation about his potential retirement. Given his limited recent appearances for Pakistan, many supporters believed the 37-year-old was preparing to end his career.Sarfaraz has since provided clarity on his earlier statement, confirming he remains active in cricket despite being outside the national selection committee's considerations.""Yes, I said 'nothing is left to say' the other day. Look, I am still playing cricket and will avail whatever opportunity I would get. In the Pakistan team, I never said that I want to bat in this position or that position."" He added, ""If I could be selected [in the national team], I would be. As far as leaving cricket is concerned, that is my personal decision. When I feel that I should quit cricket, I will quit,"" ANI quoted Sarfaraz as saying to Geo News in an interview.Since his Pakistan debut in 2007, Sarfaraz has been significant across all formats. His statistics include 54 Tests, 117 ODIs and 61 T20Is, accumulating 6,164 runs with six centuries and 32 fifties.His captaincy achievements include leading Pakistan to their first ICC Champions Trophy in 2017, defeating India by 180 runs in the final. He also guided Pakistan to victory in 11 consecutive T20I series, setting a national record for captains.Recently, his international appearances have decreased. His final Test match was in Australia in 2023, where he scored seven runs in his sole appearance of the series.

We know why we don't want to go there (open with an Indian opener)—the power isn't there.""Bobat echoed Karthik's sentiment, emphasising Phil Salt's consistency and boundary-hitting prowess. He noted Salt's remarkable statistic of scoring 15 or more runs in an over 35% of the time.""Salt has achieved that consistently. If we aggregate everything, he emerges as the common denominator.""Karthik further elaborated on Salt's scoring patterns, underscoring his ability to consistently accumulate runs in boundaries. He provided specific statistical insights into Salt's scoring frequency.""My concurrence is that Phil Salt scores 6–8 runs in an over 28% of the time, and 12–15 runs in an over 30% of the time. In one out of four overs, he scores 16 or more runs, and in one out of two overs, he scores 12 or more.""RCB's preferred list of openers was revealed, highlighting their strategic considerations. The list included Phil Salt, Will Jacks, Rachin Ravindra, Jos Buttler, and Faf du Plessis.The video concluded by explaining the final decision. Salt's impressive statistics, dual role as a wicketkeeper, and his position in the auction order made him a compelling choice. RCB ultimately acquired Salt for Rs 11.5 crore.""Salt, Jacks, and Faf were considered for the opening slot. Salt's staggering numbers, dual skill of wicketkeeping, and auction order made him a priority option, and RCB ended up picking Salt for Rs 11.5 crore."" The video ended with a note.Du Plessis, a 40-year-old right-handed opening batsman, has a rich IPL history. He has represented Chennai Super Kings (CSK), Rising Pune Supergiant (RPS), and RCB.In his 145 IPL matches, Du Plessis has scored 4,571 runs at an average of 35.99. His strike rate exceeds 136, and his highest individual score is 96.Since becoming RCB's captain in 2022, Du Plessis has been a consistent performer. He amassed 1,636 runs at an average of 38.05 and a strike rate of nearly 147. He scored 15 half-centuries in 45 innings, with a high score of 96.Du Plessis played a crucial role in RCB's playoff qualification last season, contributing 438 runs at an average of 29.20 and a strike rate of 161.62. This included four half-centuries, with his highest score being 64.Despite his valuable contributions, RCB chose not to retain Du Plessis for the IPL 2025 season. Instead, they retained Virat Kohli, Rajat Patidar, and Yash Dayal.","Royal Challengers Bengaluru released Faf du Plessis before the IPL mega auction. Delhi Capitals subsequently secured the batsman for Rs 2 crore. RCB released a video detailing their rationale for releasing the 40-year-old.

NEW DELHI: Sanath Jayasuriya , the head coach of the Sri Lankan cricket team, provided an objective assessment of his team's performance in the recently concluded Test series against South Africa. Sri Lanka suffered a 109-run defeat in the second Test, resulting in a 2-0 series whitewash by the hosts.Jayasuriya acknowledged that the Sri Lankan batters need to convert their starts into substantial scores, particularly hundreds, to be competitive in challenging conditions away from home.""Batsmen have to convert their scores into hundreds - 30s and 40s aren't enough. It's tough on these wickets, but at least two batters have to score hundreds on a tour like this. We didn't get that.

Rohit Sharma press conference after loss in Adelaide Test vs Australia

NEW DELHI: Former Australian pacer Damien Fleming has expressed doubts about the fitness of Jasprit Bumrah , suggesting that the Indian fast bowler might be dealing with more than just a cramp following his performance in the second Test of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy at Adelaide Oval.""There's no way that's cramp.

Norway's football association has declared its intention to abstain from endorsing Saudi Arabia 's hosting of the 2034 World Cup. The decision is based on concerns over FIFA's perceived inadequate efforts to safeguard human rights in connection with the tournament.“FIFA’s own guidelines for human rights and due diligence have also not been adequately integrated into the process, increasing the risk of human rights violations.”FIFA's 211 member associations are scheduled for an online meeting. The purpose of this meeting is to formally approve Saudi Arabia as the 2034 World Cup host. The meeting will also confirm the six-nation bid, spearheaded by Spain, Portugal, and Morocco, for the 2030 World Cup, involving matches across three continents.“(Wednesday’s) vote is not about who gets the 2030 and 2034 World Cups - that has already been decided.”Norway's federation president, Lise Klaveness, has expressed concerns about the voting process. She argues that FIFA's approval without an itemized vote lacks transparency.“ (Wednesday's) vote ... does not align with the principles of a sound and predictable governance system.”FIFA's approach to the bidding process has been criticized for limited external scrutiny. This comes as FIFA and its president, Gianni Infantino, strengthen financial and political ties with Saudi Arabia.Saudi Arabia's extensive infrastructure plans for the World Cup include stadiums, hotels, and transportation. These projects are expected to rely heavily on migrant labor, raising concerns about potential human rights issues. Similar concerns were raised about worker conditions in Qatar during preparations for the 2022 World Cup.FIFA's internal evaluation of Saudi Arabia's bid identified elevated human rights risks, while also noting potential positive impacts. This assessment has been met with skepticism from human rights activists.A human rights report commissioned by FIFA and conducted by a firm closely associated with Saudi Arabia has also drawn criticism. The report commits World Cup organizers to collaborate solely with state-approved domestic agencies and the International Labour Organization (ILO).The ILO, based in Geneva, previously worked with Qatar on labor reforms. It is currently investigating a formal complaint filed by the Building and Wood Workers' International, a global trade union, alleging labor abuses in Saudi Arabia.The Swiss Football Association has indicated it will support FIFA's decisions regarding the 2030 and 2034 World Cups. However, they have also acknowledged certain ambiguities in Saudi Arabia's strategy for protecting rights and freedoms.“We consider it the duty of FIFA and the organizers, in cooperation with renowned independent international organizations ... to look closely, observe and monitor whether commitments and promises made to workers, teams, fans and media professionals are upheld.”Despite these concerns, the Swiss Football Association expresses confidence that FIFA and World Cup organizers in Saudi Arabia have learned from the experience in Qatar.“ ... it believed FIFA and World Cup organizers in Saudi Arabia 'have learned the lessons from Qatar.'”FIFA has faced criticism for not heeding the advice of a panel of human rights experts. The panel, appointed under pressure from European football officials, including Norway, recommended compensating workers in Qatar and their families.FIFA delayed the publication of the panel's report for nearly a year. The report was eventually released on November 30th, two days after FIFA announced a $50 million legacy fund for the 2022 World Cup. This fund, however, does not provide direct compensation to workers, instead allocating funds to charity projects associated with UN agencies.“The lack of predictability and open processes challenges trust in FIFA as the global custodian of football.”",Norway's football association has declared its intention to abstain from endorsing Saudi Arabia's hosting of the 2034 World Cup.

However, the outcomes seem predetermined as neither bid faces competition.The 2030 World Cup holds special significance as it marks the centenary of the inaugural tournament held in Uruguay in 1930. To commemorate this milestone, Uruguay will host one match, alongside Argentina and Paraguay.The unique arrangement involves three different continental confederations, creating an unprecedented hosting scenario.FIFA confirmed over a year ago that the Morocco, Spain, and Portugal bid was the sole contender for 2030. Other potential bids had withdrawn.A joint British and Irish bid was abandoned to focus on hosting Euro 2028. There were also unconfirmed suggestions of a joint bid from South Korea, China, Japan, and North Korea.Four South American countries initially launched a joint bid in 2019. They believed the centenary World Cup should be held entirely on the same continent as the first tournament.In late 2022, UEFA promoted a joint bid involving Spain, Portugal, and war-torn Ukraine. This was seen as a gesture of “solidarity” following the Russian invasion.Ukraine was subsequently removed from the candidacy. Morocco joined the Iberian nations, and South America agreed to host three symbolic matches in exchange.Following the “centenary celebrations” in the Southern Hemisphere winter, the participating teams and their fans will travel across the Atlantic for the remaining 101 matches.This extensive tournament will conclude with the final on July 21st. The venue for the final match is yet to be determined.Spain, which hosted the 1982 World Cup, is expected to play a central role, offering 11 of the proposed 20 stadiums.Morocco, having unsuccessfully bid five times previously, will become the second African nation to host the World Cup, following South Africa in 2010.Potential final venues include Madrid’s Santiago Bernabeu, Barcelona’s renovated Camp Nou, and the planned Hassan II stadium. The Hassan II stadium, located between Casablanca and Rabat, is projected to be the ""biggest stadium in the world"" with a capacity of 115,000.Portugal, which hosted Euro 2004, will contribute two stadiums in Lisbon and one in Porto, hoping to host a semi-final.Regarding the 2034 World Cup, FIFA invoked its continental rotation principle, welcoming bids only from Asia or Oceania. The 2026 World Cup, expanded to 48 teams, will be hosted across North America.FIFA gave potential bidders a short timeframe to submit candidacies, causing controversy. Australia and Indonesia quickly withdrew their interest.This left Saudi Arabia as the sole candidate. This paves the way for the World Cup to return to the Gulf region after Qatar hosted in 2022.Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has been utilizing sport to enhance the nation's global image and influence.Securing the 2034 World Cup would be a significant achievement for Saudi Arabia. Currently, they possess only two stadiums with a capacity of 40,000, while 14 are required.Besides the logistical challenges, the extreme summer temperatures might necessitate rescheduling the tournament to later in the year, similar to the 2022 World Cup in Qatar. The timing of Ramadan in December 2034 presents an additional complication.The awarding of the World Cup to Saudi Arabia is expected to reignite discussions surrounding human rights, as seen with Qatar in 2022.Rights groups have raised concerns about mass executions, allegations of torture, restrictions on women under the male guardianship system, and limitations on free expression in Saudi Arabia.Saudi Arabia, currently hosting high-profile events like Formula One and the WTA Finals, faces accusations of ""sportswashing.""

Forest kept the home side at bay after Bruno Fernandes pulled one back.United's Andre Onana was embarrassed by a swerving Gibbs-White strike for Forest's second while the goalkeeper, Lisandro Martinez and Matthijs De Ligt all failed to deal with a looping Wood header for the third.The win lifts Forest to fifth in the Premier League table.

Jude Bellingham guided champions Real Madrid to a comfortable 3-0 victory at Girona on Saturday in La Liga , with Kylian Mbappe also on the scoresheet after two high-profile penalty misses in recent games.Los Blancos cut the gap on league leaders Barcelona to two points after the Catalans drew 2-2 at Real Betis , with Madrid having played one fewer match.Bellingham opened the scoring before half-time and set up Turkish playmaker Arda Guler for Madrid's second, before Mbappe produced a clinical finish for their third.Both Bellingham and defender Ferland Mendy were replaced with apparent knocks in the second half ahead of Tuesday's Champions League clash at Atalanta.Coach Carlo Ancelotti confirmed Bellingham was ""available"" for the game but said Mendy had suffered a muscular injury.After Madrid's fifth defeat across all competitions in midweek against Athletic Bilbao, having lost just twice last season, Ancelotti pledged his team would improve and they were significantly better against Girona.""Bellingham scored his fifth goal running (in La Liga), Mbappe scored, Brahim (Diaz) did good work, Arda scored a great goal,"" Ancelotti said.""We have to bear the moment out and as I said, bit by bit we will come back (to form).""With Vinicius Junior and Rodrygo sidelined, Ancelotti selected Bellingham and Diaz in support of Mbappe.The French forward has been the focus of criticism in recent weeks after blowing penalties against Liverpool and Athletic Bilbao, and struggling to find the form which made him a star with Paris Saint-Germain and his country.Girona, who ran Madrid close for the Spanish title for much of last season before eventually finishing third, started the stronger but Madrid soon clicked into gear.Bellingham pounced after 36 minutes when Diaz's cross was blocked and the ball fell kindly to the England international to drill home.It was Bellingham's fifth goal in his last five La Liga games, finding the form which powered Madrid to a Champions League and La Liga double last season.Los Blancos got their second in the 55th minute when Bellingham threaded through a fine pass for Guler to finish.Mbappe rattled in Madrid's third from a tight angle after Bellingham hobbled off with a knock after Luka Modric played him in down the right.Ancelotti will hope Madrid can carry some momentum into the vital Champions League visit to Atalanta, for which Vinicius is expected to return from a hamstring problem.Girona, eighth in La Liga, welcome Liverpool in the Champions League on Tuesday.Earlier Real Betis twice came behind to stop Barcelona from triumphing in Seville.Assane Diao levelled in the 94th minute to stun Barcelona, who opened the scoring after 39 minutes through Robert Lewandowski.After Giovani Lo Celso levelled for the mid-table hosts from the penalty spot, substitute Ferran Torres struck what seemed the winner before Diao's late intervention.Barcelona coach Hansi Flick said his team had to improve on the road, where most of their set-backs have come this season.""We have the quality to win every match but we also have to show that,"" said Flick.""(In) the away matches we have to be much stronger than we played here.""Real Betis started strongly, with Raphinha forced to clear Diego Llorente's header off his own goal-line.The electric Yamal helped Barcelona get on top as Betis sat deep and the Catalans found the breakthrough shortly before the break with a slick move finished by Lewandowski.It was the 36-year-old striker's 16th league goal of the campaign and he leads the charts in Spain.The hosts levelled with a penalty converted by Lo Celso, when Frenkie de Jong stepped on the heel of Vitor Roque, on loan at Betis from Barca, with Flick sent off for protesting.""I'm really disappointed about (my red card), I thought that would never happen to me,"" Flick told reporters.Torres netted his second goal in two games to put Barca back in front before Diao struck late on.""I'm very happy with the goal,"" said the 19-year-old forward.

NEW DELHI: Former world number one tennis player from Romania Simona Halep has raised concerns about the perceived discrepancies in the treatment of cases involving positive tests for banned substances by the International Tennis Integrity Agency ( ITIA ).Her criticism stems from the recent one-month ban imposed on Iga Swiatek , the current world number two, after testing positive for the heart medication trimetazidine (TMZ) in an out-of-competition sample.Halep, who returned to tennis in March 2023 after serving a provisional suspension since October 2022 for testing positive for roxadustat at the US Open, believes there is a lack of consistency in the ITIA's approach.She questions the significant difference in the penalties handed out to her and Swiatek, despite the cases occurring around the same time.In her statement, Halep expressed her bewilderment at the disparate treatment and questioned the logical reasoning behind the ITIA's decisions. She accused the organization of attempting to ""destroy"" her career, despite the evidence presented, and claimed to have suffered from the perceived injustice.“I have always believed in good, I have believed in the fairness of this sport, I have believed in kindness,"" Halep wrote on Instagram. “The injustice that was done to me was painful, is painful and maybe will always be painful. How is it possible that in identical cases that happened at about the same time (of the season), ITIA has completely different approaches, to my detriment?”Halep had initially received a four-year ban from the ITIA, which she successfully appealed at the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) in February 2023. The CAS ruled that her positive test for roxadustat, a banned blood doping agent, was the result of a contaminated supplement.Her experience has raised concerns about the fairness and impartiality of the disciplinary process within the tennis governing bodies.",Former world number one tennis player Simona Halep has raised concerns about the perceived discrepancies in the treatment of positive tests by the ITIA.

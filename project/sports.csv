Lhuan-dre Pretorius shines on SA20 debut with 97, prioritises team win over personal milestone

MI Cape Town delighted a packed Newlands crowd with a dominant 33-run victory over neighbours Paarl Royals in the first Cape Derby of the SA20 Season 3 on Monday. Against the stunning backdrop of a sunset over Table Mountain, the home side delivered a near-flawless performance to claim the derby honours. Reeza Hendricks , MI Cape Town's new signing, was the star with the bat, crafting a stylish 59 off 37 balls - his first half-century for the franchise. Hendricks anchored the innings with panache, living up to his reputation as one of the finest T20 players in the country. His 78-run partnership with Rassie van der Dussen (43 off 33 balls) set the foundation for a competitive total of 172/7.Delano Potgieter provided a late flourish, smashing an impactful 29 off just 18 balls to ensure MI Cape Town had momentum heading into the second innings.The Royals started their chase aggressively, with Joe Root (26 off 14 balls) and Lhuan-dre Pretorius (26 off 12 balls) combining for a brisk 38 runs in just three overs. However, the introduction of Kagiso Rabada turned the game on its head. Rabada dismissed both Root and Pretorius in quick succession, with each wicket coming in consecutive wicket-maiden overs - an extraordinary feat.The Royals struggled to regain their footing after Rabada's blows.MI Cape Town’s spin duo of George Linde and Rashid Khan then tightened the screws, dismantling the middle order. Linde bowled with precision and control, finishing with remarkable figures of 3/15, while Rashid, as dependable as ever, claimed 2/28.The visitors eventually succumbed to the relentless pressure, falling well short of the target. The Royals were stopped at 139/9 in their 20 overs. The comprehensive win marked MI Cape Town’s return to form and sent the Newlands faithful home with smiles on their faces.Looking ahead, the two Western Cape sides will clash again in the second leg of the Cape Derby at Boland Park on Wednesday. MI Cape Town will hope to build on this commanding performance, while the Royals will aim for redemption in front of their home fans.","MI Cape Town beat Paarl Royals by 33 runs in the first Cape Derby of the SA20 Season 3 on Monday.

Brief scores:

MI Emirates: 187/7 in 20 overs (Tom Banton 74, Nicholas Pooran 59, Kieron Pollard 22, Gulbadin Naib 3 for 18)

3 for 18) Dubai Capitals: 161/6 in 20 overs (Shai Hope 101, Brandon McMullen 16, Fazalhaq Farooqi 2 for 22)

ILT20: Rovman Powell lauds Farhan Khan for stopping Kieron Pollard

The MI Emirates claimed their first victory of the ILT20 2025 season with a commanding 26-run win against the Dubai Capitals at the Zayed Cricket Stadium in Abu Dhabi on Monday. Half-centuries from Tom Banton and Nicholas Pooran set the stage for a strong performance, while Fazalhaq Farooqi 's brilliant bowling sealed the deal.Despite a heroic century from Shai Hope , the Dubai Capitals suffered their first loss against MI Emirates in the tournament's history. Hope's 101 off 59 balls, the first century for a Capitals player in the ILT20 and only the third in the competition’s history, was in vain as the Emirates’ bowlers turned the tide late in the game.Chasing a target of 188, the Capitals started cautiously, with Akeal Hosein's spin nearly providing an early breakthrough. A dropped catch by Waqar Salamkheil gave Hope a reprieve, allowing him to anchor the innings. Alzarri Joseph dismissed Ben Dunk in the powerplay, but Hope brought up his fifty in 32 balls, partnering with McMullen for a 61-run stand before the latter was stumped by Pooran.Hope's century came in spectacular fashion, hitting AM Ghazanfar for a four and a six. However, his dismissal on the next ball shifted momentum to the Emirates. Farooqi delivered a game-changing over, bowling Sikandar Raza and Dasun Shanaka with successive yorkers, leaving the Capitals reeling. Zahoor Khan followed up with an economical penultimate over, and the Capitals found the final over target of 36 runs insurmountable, ending their chase at 161.Earlier in the evening, the MI Emirates overcame a shaky start to post a competitive total of 187 for 7. Dushmantha Chameera struck with the very first delivery, removing Kusal Perera and putting the Capitals on the front foot. Tom Banton steadied the innings alongside Muhammad Waseem, adding 38 runs before Raza's sharp throw from mid-off ended Waseem's innings.Banton brought stability, crafting a well-paced 74 off 52 balls, while Pooran provided fireworks with his explosive 59 off 29 deliveries. Pooran smashed Olly Stone for three consecutive sixes in the 15th over before falling in pursuit of a fourth. Kieron Pollard contributed 22 off 19 as the Emirates posted a formidable target.Despite Hope's brilliance, the Capitals faltered under the pressure of disciplined bowling. Farooqi, with figures of 2-22, and Zahoor Khan's tight spells proved decisive in the Emirates' maiden victory.Reflecting on the loss, Hope admitted, ""A hundred always feels sweeter when it contributes to a win. Unfortunately, we fell short with the bat today.""Meanwhile, Player of the Match Tom Banton highlighted his role in anchoring the innings, saying, ""It was tricky at the start, but we had spoken about someone batting through. I'm glad I could contribute to the team's first win.""The victory gives MI Emirates much-needed momentum as they look to build on this performance in the season ahead.","MI Emirates claimed their first victory of the ILT20 2025 season with a commanding 26-run win against the Dubai Capitals at the Zayed Cricket Stadium in Abu Dhabi on Monday.

SA20: Kagiso Rabada stars as MI Cape Town triumph in Cape Derby

MI Cape Town 's pace spearhead Kagiso Rabada delivered a match-winning performance in their 33-run victory over Paarl Royals during the first Cape Derby of SA20 Season 3 at Newlands on Monday. Rabada's two remarkable wicket-maiden overs turned the game on its head, as he dismissed Royals' openers Joe Root (26 off 14) and Lhuan-dre Pretorius (26 off 12) in quick succession.Reflecting on his performance, Rabada credited his execution of plans for his success. ""I guess I was just trying to hit good lengths and mix it up with the slow ball and a bouncer whenever I felt it was right. So that's what I tried to do, and it paid off,"" Rabada said post-match.Despite the Royals' strong start, Rabada was confident in his approach. ""I was always going to bowl from the fourth over. I think I was always scheduled to bowl at that time,"" he explained.Rabada also shared his admiration for teammate Trent Boult , who bowled alongside him with the new ball. ""Trent Boult, played against him for so many years and you get nervous in the changing room whenever he has the ball, especially the new ball. It's nice to play with him, bounce ideas off each other, and just talk fast bowling. It's pretty cool to share the same dressing room with someone like that,"" he said.Rabada praised the atmosphere at Newlands, a venue he described as special. ""Newlands is a stadium with a rich cricket heritage. People in Cape Town love cricket, and it shows in the turnout. The beautiful backdrop of the mountain behind the stadium makes it unique and gets people coming to watch some good cricket,"" he remarked.Reflecting on MI Cape Town's season so far, Rabada highlighted the benefits of team continuity. ""One thing that's different is that we've been with each other for a while now. It's a similar team, and that helps. Guys are more familiar with each other. But every season is fresh - this year is totally different from last year,"" he noted.Looking ahead to their rematch against the Royals in two days, Rabada emphasised the need to reset. ""You've got to start again. Today we're happy with the win, but we need to assess and see if we can make it two out of two,"" he concluded.","MI Cape Town beat Paarl Royals by 33 runs in first Cape Derby of SA20 Season 3.

Test stalwart

recalls the 1978 tour in new memoir

Poll Which India-Pakistan Player Duel Defined the Rivalry? MS Dhoni vs. Shahid Afridi Sachin Tendulkar vs. Shoaib Akhtar

NEW DELHI: Indian cricketers received a tumultuous welcome when they arrived in Pakistan for a Test series in 1978. But the players were taken aback when a foreign-educated Pakistani cricketer referred to them as ""kafirs"", a pejorative term for those who don't adhere to Islam.""An unnecessary remark by a Cambridge-educated cricketer gave us a bit of a shock,"" writes Mohinder Amarnath in his newly-released memoirs, Fearless, penned with brother Rajender. The player who made the remark is not named.The incident occurred after a game in Rawalpindi. ""After the match, we were a bit casual boarding the bus. Gratuitously, this cricketer said, ""Bithao, bithao, in kafiron ko jaldi bithao (Board these nonbelievers quickly),"" writes Amarnath, further adding, ""What was the use of a good education if it could not change their negative attitude towards others?""In contrast, the cricketers received a wildly joyous reception at the Karachi airport. About 40,000-50,000 turned up to welcome the visiting team. The crowd was double the number, but many had left beforehand because the flight was delayed.""The distance from the airport to the hotel normally took 20 minutes, but for us, it took four hours; people had occupied every inch of space on the pavement and the road, and they refused to leave unless and until they caught a glimpse of the Indian cricketers or shaken hands with us. They were warm and hospitable,"" says Amarnath, who played 69 Tests, scored 4,378 runs, hit 11 tons, took 32 wickets, was also Man of the Match in India's 1983 ODI World Cup final triumph.However, some Pakistani players behaved differently. The memoir says, ""… this artificial bubble burst quicker than anticipated and hostility emerged from an expected quarter. Apparently, certain Pakistani players acted on the advice of seniors and kept their distance. If we spoke to them, their tone and tenor was aggressive. At least two of them, Javed Miandad and Sarfraz Nawaz , and to a lesser degree Mudassar Nazar, took the advice a little too seriously. I don't think either Javed or Sarfraz ever kept quiet on the field.""The cricketer, known to be one of the finest players of pace bowling, recalls an incident in the Karachi Test involving Nawaz and Sunil Gavaskar , who hit centuries in both innings (111 and 137) in the game.""Whenever he bowled a bouncer, Gavaskar allowed it to sail over his head. When the same bowler pitched the ball up to him, it was dispatched to the fence. This annoyed Sarfraz and he vented his frustration in crass Punjabi words, which Gavaskar couldn't understand. After the over, he came to me and asked, ""Why is Sarfraz calling me pant coat?' I laughed at his ignorance and whispered, ""He meant p…c…!"" Those who still cannot follow should recall the 'Ben Stokes' memes on social media.In the late 1970s, exceptions aside, alcohol was banned in Pakistan. Fateh Singh Rao Gaekwad, who was the manager of the team, hosted the players at his Bombay residence before the tour and, ""on a lighter note"" asked the players ""fond of drinks"" to carry their quota.""Many were taken aback by the suggestion, knowing the restrictions on alcohol in Pakistan. The next morning, crates of two-litre Johnnie Walker Red Label whisky arrived and was distributed among the players,"" the memoir says.","Mohinder Amarnath recalls 1978 tour of Pakistan in new memoir Fearless.

Manchester United scored first with a sublime strike (David Beckham in 1999 and Bruno Fernandes in 2025).

Arsenal had a goal ruled out for offside (Nicolas Anelka in 1999 and Gabriel Martinelli in 2025).

Arsenal equalised (Dennis Bergkamp in 1999 and Gabriel in 2025).

United had a player sent off (Roy Keane in 1999 and Diogo Dalot in 2025).

United’s keeper saved a fantastic penalty and made numerous other saves to keep them in the game (Peter Schmeichel in 1999 and Altay Bayindir in 2025).

Roy Keane CLASHES with Patrick Vieira in the Highbury tunnel! 💥

Full Penalty Shootout | Arsenal 5-4 Manchester United | 2005 FA Cup Final

Coaching The Fundamental

Since Sir Alex Ferguson retired in 2013, Manchester United fans – particularly those who reached adolescence when the Class of 1992 made the first-team cut – have channelled their inner Ronin (Hawkeye’s murderous avatar into beg the team not to give hope. Over the years, there have been numerous false dawns, slivers of light ahead of the tunnel that have made United fans dream again before they were snatched away, like Morpheus’ Nebuchadnezzar’s lament: “I had a dream, but the dream was taken from me.”There was the Van Gaal era where fans were convinced that a former tactician – a man some claim invented modern football – could bring United back to the glory years. Then they convinced themselves that the Special One, by sheer dint of willpower and personality (and a little bit of the dark arts), the fallen Lucifer to Pep Guardiola’s Michael, would be the right person to resuscitate the Red Devils. They almost persuaded themselves, when Ole was at the wheel, that the good times were rolling again. It certainly felt like that on that night in Paris and when United were playing like the Fergie teams of yore. They even dared to hope that a man named Eric would lead the charge again, much like the collared Frenchman who did it in the early Fergie years.And now, Ruben Amorim, the youngest Man Utd manager in half a century, is playing the Pandora’s Box’s old trick again. Of course, on paper, Amorim’s record is nothing to write home about. His record in his first 13 games reads: five wins, two draws and six losses. Most other Man Utd managers actually have better records. Sir Alex Ferguson’s read: three wins, seven draws and three losses. It’s what came after those 13 games that makes Manchester United fans believe.But there has been something of the old grit that defined Fergie teams that has Utd fans daring to hope again. The back-to-the-wall performance evoked an older Man Utd vs Arsenal clash: the epic 1999 replay.The similarities are astounding between the 1999 FA Cup semi-final replay and the 2025 third-round showdown between the two clubs.The only difference in the 2025 match was that it was decided on penalty shootouts and not a wondrous Ryan Giggs goal that made Maradona look up from his cocaine pile.And in a strange way, it was a mirror image of the 2005 FA Cup final with its infamous Band of Brothers viral image featuring Paul Scholes, Roy Keane, Cristiano Ronaldo, Wayne Rooney , Ryan Giggs, Mikaël Silvestre and Quinton Fortune.Incidentally, Manchester United battered Arsenal in that match – a follow-up to the infamous 4-2 “I will see you out there” Highbury fight – but still lost on a penalty shootout with Paul Scholes missing the last penalty. That day, United had eight shots on target, 12 off target, and 12 corners (far more than Arsenal) but still lost.It was a different ballgame in 2025. Arsenal had 26 shots to Man Utd’s seven, 71% of the possession, and a 3.3 xG to United’s 1.1 but failed to make their mark. United players have been struggling to adapt to Ruben Amorim’s style, but against Arsenal (like they did against Manchester City and Liverpool), there was a slight glimpse of the taste in the pudding.In the cult classic Coach Carter – when Samuel L. Jackson was whipping a bunch of askew young men into shape – he was asked by his team what they should do since they hadn’t practised attacking. To this, Jackson’s Carter had said: “Run.” And that’s what United players did in the match, all of them running together as a pack to keep Arsenal at bay.Harry Maguire, often the pantomime villain on the football pitch and even in parliaments around the world, was a colossus in defence. Equally driven were Lisandro Martínez and Matthijs de Ligt, the latter finally learning how to operate in a three-man midfield.Of course, Arsenal’s inability to finish was one of the major reasons this match went to penalties, with Kai Havertz moved around the pitch like Roy Keane was screaming “You can’t score in a brothel!” in his ear.But United fans will rejoice at the grit from a team that, during the last days of the Ten Hag era, looked like they were simply not interested in playing football. Whether it was Bayindir’s redemption after the horror performance against Tottenham in the Carabao Cup, academy graduate Toby Collyer’s gut-bursting runs, Bruno’s Roy Keane impression or Noussair Mazraoui and Manuel Ugarte in midfield, this was a team effort.And the performance came against refereeing that launched a thousand memes about Arsenal players diving with abandon, which included a soft penalty and a red card.A swallow doesn’t make a summer, and Manchester United will probably have to suffer for many more years before they finally have a team worthy of cleaning the boots of any of the vintage Ferguson teams. But for the moment, United fans can at least hope that the current side, even if they lack the sheer world-class talent of the Band of Brothers or the 1999 winning team or any of the great Fergie teams, will give it their all every time they are wearing the United shirt.Next up in the FA Cup: Ruud van Nistelrooy’s Leicester City, the last interim manager of Manchester United and a man who knows a thing or two about the gigantic expectations that come with wearing the Manchester United shirt.",Manchester United lost 3-2 to Arsenal in the 2025 FA Cup third round. The match was a mirror image of the epic 1999 FA Cup semi-final replay. The only difference between the two matches was that it was decided on penalty shootouts.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117203496,imgsize-67192,width-400,resizemode-4/117203496.jpg"

In an alarming coincidence, each of their three home losses in this ISL campaign have come by that very scoreline.In a game that took until the second half to come to life, it was Mohammed Sanan who set the visitors on their way in the 64th minute with a clinical finish.Just as Mumbai City so nearly drew level when Nikolaos Karelis's left-footed effort stung Albino Gomes's palms in the closing minutes, Jordan Murray (86th) sealed the three points for Khalid Jamil's side following a quick break after Jamshedpur had won back possession.There was time for one final dagger which arrived in stoppage time as Javi Hernandez (90+6) fired home from inside the box.The win saw Jamshedpur climb to third place, level on points with Bengaluru (27pts) with a game in hand. Mumbai, meanwhile, still occupy sixth spot and that final playoff berth, but were left to rue another bitter outing at home. Although they went into this game with a confidence-boosting 3-2 win at East Bengal last week, there is no doubt that the Islanders are finding goals hard to come by this season.Coach Petr Kratky has even resorted to switching captain Lallianzuala Chhangte from his favoured position on the right of their usual three-man attack to playing in the hole behind the front three.It would yield no dividends on this occasion, as Jamshedpur's backline were disciplined enough to deal with anything Karelis, Vikram Partap Singh or Bipin Singh were able to ask of them.To make matters worse, Chhangte was sent off after the game for dissent.","Jamshedpur beat Mumbai City 0-3 at the Mumbai Football Arena. Mohammed Sanan, Jordan Murray and Javi Hernandez scored the goals for the visitors.

Altay Bayindir was the unexpected hero for Manchester United as they edged past Arsenal in a dramatic FA Cup encounter at the Emirates. The match ended 1-1 after 90 minutes, and United triumphed 5-4 on penalties, with Bayindir making crucial saves both in normal time and during the shootout to send the holders into the fourth round.United took the lead early in the second half when Bruno Fernandes unleashed a thunderous strike into the top corner, capitalising on a slip by Gabriel after Alejandro Garnacho's incisive run. However, the game turned when Diogo Dalot received a second yellow card on the hour mark for a reckless challenge, leaving United to defend with 10 men for over half an hour.Arsenal wasted no time exploiting their numerical advantage as Gabriel Magalhães scored the equaliser, with Bayindir failing to deal with Gabriel Martinelli’s cross, resulting in a deflected shot finding the net.Despite dominating possession and creating multiple chances, Arsenal failed to capitalise. Their woes were compounded when Bayindir saved Martin Odegaard’s penalty following a controversial decision against Harry Maguire, who was furious at the call and clashed with Kai Havertz during the ensuing melee.Bayindir redeemed himself further with a stunning stop to deny Declan Rice and another to keep Havertz at bay as Arsenal squandered golden opportunities to secure the win in regulation.In the penalty shootout, United were flawless. Fernandes, Amad Diallo, Leny Yoro, Lisandro Martinez, and Josua Zirkzee all converted their spot-kicks, with Zirkzee calmly scoring the decisive penalty. Bayindir’s save against Havertz in the shootout proved pivotal, capping a remarkable performance for the Turkish goalkeeper.The defeat deepens Arsenal’s recent struggles, coming on the back of a League Cup semi-final first-leg loss to Newcastle. Manager Mikel Arteta expressed his frustration, stating, ""We deserved to win based on performance, but the reality is we’re out.""Arsenal’s misery was compounded by the sight of Gabriel Jesus being stretchered off in the first half with a suspected knee injury, adding to their growing list of absentees.For United, the win was a testament to their resilience under manager Ruben Amorim, who praised his side’s character in a hard-fought victory. The holders now face Leicester City in the fourth round, with the added storyline of Ruud van Nistelrooy , a United legend, returning to Old Trafford as Leicester’s manager.",Manchester United beat Arsenal 5-4 on penalties in the FA Cup third round.

Real Madrid's coach, Carlo Ancelotti, believes his team can avenge their previous defeat against Barcelona in the Spanish Super Cup final on Sunday. He emphasized the importance of learning from past mistakes to secure a victory.Barcelona had convincingly defeated Real Madrid 4-0 at the Santiago Bernabeu in La Liga earlier in the season. However, Real Madrid managed to surpass them in the league standings before the winter break.“We have to think about that game obviously, they beat us, we had a clear evaluation of what happened.”Ancelotti acknowledged the significance of the previous encounter and the need to analyze their performance. He stressed the importance of replicating the positive aspects of their play while avoiding past errors.“We started the game well, then had problems in the second half, so we have to try and repeat the good things we did and avoid the mistakes we made.”The added pressure of a final against their rivals adds another layer of complexity to the upcoming match. Ancelotti acknowledged the unique nature of Clasico finals.“The Clasico is even more pressured when it's a final, we've played a lot against Barcelona and playing a final against them is always something special.”Real Madrid's challenge lies in finding a balance between their attacking prowess and defensive solidity, especially after Kylian Mbappe 's arrival. The attacking quartet of Mbappe, Vinicius Junior, Jude Bellingham, and Rodrygo Goes offers significant offensive firepower. However, their defensive contributions are crucial for team balance.“(In recent Clasicos) individual quality has prevailed over team balance.”Ancelotti highlighted the importance of collective effort and defensive stability in such high-stakes matches.“An important aspect tomorrow will be balance and collective work -- defending.”He firmly believes that a strong defensive performance increases their chances of winning.“If you defend well, there's more chance of winning.”Despite a successful 2024 season with La Liga and Champions League titles, Ancelotti admitted that the heavy defeat against Barcelona remained a low point.“We're close to another trophy, we're thinking positively, but we know that in football anything can happen, above all when the opponent is strong and competes well like Barcelona.”Ancelotti acknowledged the unpredictable nature of football, particularly against a strong opponent like Barcelona. He also highlighted Real Madrid's progress and improvement as a team.“Our team has improved, nobody can argue with that.”He expressed confidence in their continued progress regardless of the outcome of the Super Cup final.“A defeat wouldn't be good but the team is not going backwards, it will keep moving forwards.”Dani Olmo's availability for Barcelona after a controversial temporary license approval by the Spanish national sports council (CSD) presents a challenge for Real Madrid.“Olmo will play and we have to minimise his quality.”Ancelotti chose to focus on minimizing Olmo's impact on the game rather than commenting on the controversy surrounding his eligibility.Barcelona coach Hansi Flick confirmed Olmo's readiness to play but hinted at a possible starting role for Gavi.“Gavi had a great performance against Athletic, he's got confidence... I think he's is going to play, but I am not 100 percent sure of who will play.”The Super Cup final represents Flick's first opportunity to win a trophy with Barcelona. He acknowledged the importance of a victory for the team's confidence.“If we win, we will have more confidence for the rest of the season.”He further emphasized the significance of winning the game for everyone involved.“Winning the game would be something really big for everyone.”",Real Madrid face Barcelona in the Spanish Super Cup final on Sunday.

Amadou Onana drew Villa level before Morgan Rogers struck the decisive goal, leaving Potter visibly dejected.The defeat marked Potter's return to management following his departure from Chelsea in April 2023. His tenure at Stamford Bridge had been brief and challenging, with 11 defeats in 31 matches and a disappointing 11th-place position in the Premier League.With merely one training session before travelling to Villa and the absence of crucial strikers Jarrod Bowen and Michail Antonio, Potter faced significant challenges.Despite these limitations, the attacking display from West Ham showed promise, though addressing their defensive vulnerabilities remains the primary concern.Lopetegui struggled to maintain the robust framework established by David Moyes, who secured the Europa Conference League in 2023 before departing at the season's conclusion.Potter demonstrated his ability to address these tactical concerns as West Ham displayed impressive attacking prowess against Villa in the first half.Paqueta nearly provided Potter with an ideal beginning when the Brazilian's attempt from the area's periphery narrowly missed the target.It was a warning Villa failed to heed as Paqueta opened the scoring in the ninth minute.Summerville displayed his skill by outmanoeuvring Villa's Maatsen during a decisive run into the box, before delivering a precise pass to Paqueta, who finished expertly past Olsen.The new manager's jubilant celebration was short-lived, as German forward Fullkrug had to leave the pitch with an injury shortly after the goal.Continuing his impressive performance, Paqueta tested Olsen again following another penetrating attack.Villa's persistence after the interval paid off in the 71st minute. A corner kick saw Mings direct the ball towards Maatsen, whose shot was parried by Fabianski into Onana's path, allowing him to score from close range.Villa, sensing an opportunity, pressed forward in the 76th minute.

""What I can say is that we got treated in the same way, there's the protocol. If the protocol has some issues then it's not my fault.

When Novak Djokovic broke Nishesh Basavareddy for the first time in the match after 91 minutes of play, he let out a roar that echoed across Melbourne’s bustling Central Business District. It was just the first round of the Australian Open , but the 37-year-old, ten-time champion wore his hunger on his sleeve. A naked expression, a fire that rages, every point, every game.Djokovic came through 4-6, 6-3, 6-4, 6-2 in the near three-hours on Rod Laver Arena late on Monday, but that is only half the story.To be sure the 19-year-old Indian-American, a Data Science student in Stanford University until November, had his idol in a spot early in the match, even raising visions of an upset, much like another teenager Croat Dino Prizmic did last year.Basavareddy, whose stellar charge on the ATP Challenger circuit last year earned him the USTA wildcard for the Australian Open, pulled off audacious dropshots and lobs in the first set, executing to perfection, especially on the return game, that had the near 15,000 crowd gasping.His peers in the juniors and later on the collegiate circuit often compared his play to Djokovic’s all-court style, for a little over an hour, Basavareddy showed why.“I was very impressed by him. I think the whole stadium was that's why he got a great round of applause and appreciation from the crowd,” Djokovic said of Basavareddy. “They saw what he did on the court, the quality of tennis he put in, the fighting spirit. Huge credit to him for stepping out on his debut in a Grand Slam, first time on a big court, playing the way he did. I'm sure if he keeps going this way, he's very young, we’re going to see quite a bit of him in the future.”“He's got really great hands,” the Serb added. “Overall, a complete player. He can always improve on the shots, (but) he already has a really good game.”Basavareddy, whose family has roots in Hyderabad and Nellore, had his coach Bryan Smith along with his father Murali Reddy, who works in the tech industry, and older brother Nishanth, an information system major, in his courtside box, along with doubles ace Indian-American Rajeev Ram.The other side had some 27 major singles titles between them, Djokovic is now coached by three-time champion Andy Murray.“You try to focus on the court, but sometimes I go to my towel and I hear him (Andy) saying, ‘Let's go, Novak,’ and I look over and it's pretty crazy,” Basavareddy said.It was perhaps the occasion that got Basavareddy on Monday evening, playing against the man whose photograph he has as his WhatsApp display picture, the teenager struggled with cramps late in the second set and needed treatment.“He makes it really physical out there,” the teenager said of his legendary opponent. “I started feeling it a little bit in the second set, but it only lasted a couple of games. I took a couple drinks and stuff, that helped it go down in the third set. I feel better now. Just unfortunate timing in the middle of the match.”Seeing Djokovic on the other side of the net was a surreal moment for Basavareddy at the start of the match.“The coin toss was a little surreal, just seeing him in front of me, going to be competitors today. Just a cool feeling, for sure,” he said. “Obviously on the court he does everything really well, serving really well. I think that's the biggest thing he's improved in his career. Today that was a big difference between him and me, that ended up giving him the win.”","Novak Djokovic beats Nishesh Basavareddy 4-6 6-3 6-4 6-2 in the first round of the Australian Open. The 19-year-old Indian-American had his idol in a spot early in the match, raising visions of an upset.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117207768,imgsize-44176,width-400,resizemode-4/117207768.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Nick Kyrgios 's much-anticipated return to the Australian Open ended abruptly on Monday as the volatile hometown favorite crashed out in straight sets during the first round, venting his frustration at his coaching team throughout the match.Britain's Jacob Fearnley silenced the typically raucous John Cain Arena crowd with a composed 7-6 (7/3), 6-3, 7-6 (7/2) victory over the 2022 Wimbledon finalist.Kyrgios had only recently returned to competition after an 18-month layoff, during which he underwent knee surgery and wrist reconstruction.Concerns about Kyrgios's fitness had resurfaced when he withdrew from an exhibition match against Novak Djokovic four days prior, citing an abdominal strain.The fears were confirmed during the match, as the Australian called for physio assistance multiple times in the second set and visibly winced while serving.""I'm sorry for Nick,"" said Fearnley. ""I could tell he was dealing with some issues.""I knew I wasn't going to be able to get you guys on my side,"" Fearnley told the pro-Kyrgios crowd.""So I was just trying to focus on myself, try to play my game and do the best I could to try to move past every point.""I think all things considered, it's probably the best match I've ever played.""The first set saw few break opportunities, with both players dominating on serve. However, Fearnley, ranked 92nd in the world, seized control during the tiebreak, surging to a 6-1 lead with a cross-court pass and an ace.Kyrgios fended off two of five set points with powerful serves but ultimately conceded the set in 45 minutes.Kyrgios, visibly frustrated, directed a barrage of verbal outbursts at his coaching box between sets. Despite the distractions, Fearnley maintained his composure, breaking Kyrgios early in the second set and comfortably closing it out.""What's the point, boys?"" shouted Kyrgios at his team, in one of his milder outbursts.""I'm going to keep going until I can't any more.""Fearnley secured another early break in the third set, but Kyrgios, ever the showman, rallied for a late surge.Battling through evident pain, he broke back, held serve to love for a 4-3 lead, and briefly electrified the crowd.The Australian earned a set point at 4-5 on Fearnley's serve, but the Briton calmly saved it to force a tiebreak.In the decisive tiebreak, Fearnley held his nerve to seal the match after 2 hours and 19 minutes. He advances to face France's Arthur Cazaux in the second round.The victory marked just the third ATP Tour-level win for the 23-year-old Fearnley, who captured four Challenger titles last year.",Nick Kyrgios loses in straight sets to Jacob Fearnley in first round of Australian Open.

NEW DELHI: Novak Djokovic overcame an early scare on Monday to launch his campaign for an 11th Australian Open title and a record-breaking 25th Grand Slam crown.The 37-year-old Serbian faced a challenging start against American teenage wildcard Nishesh Basavareddy , who was making his Grand Slam main draw debut.The 19-year-old stunned the Melbourne Park crowd by taking the first set, showcasing his composure and skill.Djokovic, initially flat-footed and struggling for answers, gradually found his rhythm to secure a 4-6, 6-3, 6-4, 6-2 victory under the watchful eye of his new coach, Andy Murray.Murray, who retired last year, sat silently in one of the newly introduced 'coaching pods' at Rod Laver Arena. The win marked Djokovic's 18th consecutive second-round appearance at the Australian Open.Reflecting on the match, Djokovic admitted, ""At the end it was great but I think he was the better player for a set-and-a-half,"" said seventh seed Djokovic. ""He deserves every bit of applause that he got.""These kind of matchups are always tricky, dangerous when you are playing someone who has nothing to lose. He's a very complete player.""In the early stages, Djokovic appeared uncertain against the athletic Basavareddy.At 3-3 in the first set, a misjudged lob landed in, giving the American three break points.Basavareddy capitalized with a stunning crosscourt backhand, drawing gasps from the crowd.Djokovic struggled with 11 unforced errors in the set and failed to convert any of his three break points, allowing Basavareddy to close out the opener. The setback appeared to jolt Djokovic into action.In the second set, he broke to lead 5-3 and held serve to level the match, roaring in celebration. Basavareddy required treatment on his left leg during the changeover and was unable to maintain his earlier intensity.Sensing an opportunity, Djokovic tightened his grip on the match, sealing a hard-fought victory.The partnership with Murray represents a fresh chapter for Djokovic after a challenging 2024 season where he failed to win a major for the first time since 2017, with Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz dominating the Grand Slams.Although Djokovic captured Olympic gold, his struggles against a player ranked 107th in the world may raise questions about his ability to compete consistently with the current generation of stars.Despite the shaky start, Djokovic remains determined to surpass Margaret Court's record of 24 Grand Slam titles.He will face Portuguese qualifier Jaime Faria in the second round.",Novak Djokovic beats Nishesh Basavareddy 4-6 6-3 6-4 6-2 in first round of Australian Open.

NEW DELHI: Despite a doping scandal, world number one Jannik Sinner was greeted warmly on center court before defeating Nicolas Jarry in a fierce match to go to the second round of the Australian Open on Monday.Following an incredible 2024 that saw him rise to the top of the men's tennis rankings, the 23-year-old reigning champion is the overwhelming favorite to win again at Melbourne Park.He maintained that form in his season-opening match at Rod Laver Arena , defeating the powerful Chilean 7-6 (7/2), 7-6 (7/5), 6-1 to record his 16th consecutive Tour-level victory.Last Monday, the Court of Arbitration for Sport declared that it would consider an appeal by the World Anti-Doping Agency in April about a drugs scandal that shook the Italian last year. Sinner was playing his first game since then.He claimed that the medication got into his system when his physiotherapist applied a spray containing clostebol to a cut, despite the fact that he tested positive for the prohibited steroid twice in March.WADA appealed after the International Tennis Integrity Agency accepted the explanation and cleared him.There was nothing against him in the Melbourne crowd; when Sinner entered the court, he was met with cheers, and there was no indication of hostility during the match.""Today it was a close one because in the first sets it could have gone both ways,"" said Sinner, who has not tasted defeat since losing to Carlos Alcaraz in the Beijing final in October.""In the third when I broke for the first time it gave me room to breathe.

She finished the match with 12 aces and nine double-faults, and saved seven of the eight breakpoints she faced.

It’s a long story.It was a staggering 28-8 coming into the Australian Open , where the 5 ft 10’ pro was looking for his first match win at Melbourne Park since 2019. The 35-year-old, whose career has been stalled by injury more times than he has counted, is primed for marathons, sprints are not his thing, as Brazil’s Thiago Monteiro learnt at the John Cain Arena on Sunday.Nishikori saved match points under the roof before breaking Monteiro for the first time in the match in the 11th game of the third set on his 12th breakpoint opportunity to score a stunning 4-6, 6-7 (4), 7-5, 6-2, 6-3 win and take his count of five-set wins to 29.“It was a really tough one,” Nishikori said. “I almost gave up.

Not satisfied with semifinal finishes

NEW DELHI: Chirag Shetty , one half of India’s celebrated badminton doubles pair, on Monday said that the duo's renewed focus under the guidance of coach Tan Kim Her has been on strengthening their defence as they gear up for a busy season filled with high expectations.Chirag and his partner, Satwiksairaj Rankireddy , have their sights set on competing in more tournaments this season, with major titles like the World Tour Finals firmly in their crosshairs.Tan Kim Her, a Malaysian doubles specialist credited with pairing Chirag and Satwik during his first stint in India from 2015 to 2019, returned last month for a second tenure.Reflecting on Tan’s impact, Chirag shared how their dynamics has evolved over the years.""To have Tan back as our coach after 5-6 years is great. A lot of credit goes to him for our achievements. We were still youngsters when he paired us up, and it was much more directional back then. But the approach is very different now; it's much more conversational,"" Chirag told PTI.""We're already established now, so we discuss what we need to do, and as a coach, he shares his opinion.""Since Tan’s return, the duo has been fine-tuning their defence and enhancing their net play.""It's the minor changes that really matter. Everybody knows how to smash, but it's the tactical details and small improvements that we need to focus on. I think we'll work on that with Tan, especially improving our defence, which is good but not yet the best in the world,"" Chirag said.Tan also helped the pair reflect on their quarterfinal loss at the Paris Olympics, a match that still weighs heavily on their minds.""He shared his thoughts on our quarterfinal loss, where he felt we fell short. It was similar to our own assessment. We should have been better at the net, especially during crucial stages. They challenged us well at the net, and that's one area we hope to improve upon,"" Chirag addedChirag and Satwik have emerged as India’s most consistent badminton players over the past two years, making four finals and securing two titles in 2024.Despite their impressive run, which included semifinal finishes at the 2024 China Masters and Malaysia Super 1000, Chirag emphasized that their sights are set higher than just reaching the last four stages of competitions.“We’ve been consistent, but in the last two tournaments, particularly the China Open, we were coming back after a long gap, so even reaching the semifinals was unexpected. In Malaysia, we had some great wins but couldn’t progress beyond the semifinals,” Chirag said.“Winning a tournament is always the ultimate goal when we compete, so I wouldn’t say we’re satisfied with just making the semis. Our aim is to go as far as possible, especially in the upcoming tournament here in India,” he added.","Chirag Shetty and Satwiksairaj Rankireddy have their sights set on competing in more tournaments this season.

NEW DELHI: Star India shuttler Lakshya Sen on Monday reflected on the heartbreak of narrowly missing out on a maiden Olympic medal at the Paris 2024 Games.Despite the setback, the 23-year-old remains determined, expressing that the ""fire inside him is still burning"" as he gears up for a new Olympic cycle.Lakshya made history in Paris by becoming the first Indian to reach the men’s singles semifinals at the Summer Games.Along the way, he delivered remarkable performances, defeating notable opponents such as Jonatan Christie in the group stage and fellow Indian H.S. Prannoy in the Round of 16.However, his dream run was halted in the semifinals by defending champion Viktor Axelsen, who eventually secured the gold medal.Lakshya then missed out on the bronze, losing to Malaysia's Lee Zii Jia in a hard-fought match.""Last year was a bit tough for me. Coming this close to a medal and missing out. But, for me, the fire inside of me is still burning, and I want to come back somewhere from that and do well this year and leading up to the next Olympics ,"" Lakshya said in the India Open pre-tournament press conference on Monday.Lakshya has fond memories of the India Open, a BWF Super 750 event, which he won in 2022 when it was held behind closed doors due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This time, he is eager to reclaim the title in front of passionate home fans as the tournament kicks off on Tuesday.""When I won the India Open in 2022, it was not in front of the fans. So I hope I win it again in front of the amazing fans here in India. It's a great opportunity for the Indian fans to come and watch us live. Watch all the big stars,"" he added.Despite a disappointing start to the 2025 season with a first-round exit at the Malaysia Open, where he lost in straight games to lower-ranked Chi Yu-jen of Chinese Taipei, Lakshya remains focused on turning things around and delivering a strong performance on home soil.","Lakshya Sen made history in Paris by becoming the first Indian to reach the men’s singles semifinals at the Summer Games.

NEW DELHI: Star India shuttler PV Sindhu draws inspiration from her accomplished career to fuel her pursuit of success.Sindhu, at 29, possesses an impressive collection of trophies and medals, including back-to-back Olympic medals, a world championship title, and podium finishes at the Asian and Commonwealth Games.She is one of only three Indians to achieve consecutive Olympic medals.Despite a challenging previous season without international medals, including a medal-less performance at the Paris Olympics , Sindhu remains determined.Sindhu's passion for badminton remains undiminished. She continues to compete with the same fervor that propelled her to the top of the sport.""Of course yes,"" Sindhu told PTI in an interview when asked if she still has the hunger to keep going.""I am saying this because when you see those wins, how happy it makes you and how much confidence it gives you, that itself will take you to another level. Seeing wins again and again keeps that hunger going, so definitely yes.""There are some clips when you are really young when you look at it, it feels like wow, you know, you have done so much and you know why can't I do it more? You question yourself, and that's when it all starts, so yes,"" Sindhu saidSindhu acknowledges the inevitable challenges but emphasizes the importance of unwavering hope.""I have seen a lot through sport, it was important for me to believe in myself when there were days where I was injured and I didn't know if I can come back and I can be my 100%, which happened in 2015, when I had an injury, but then I bounced back, and I got a silver at Rio.""My life has changed a lot since the time I started and till now I have had a lot of awards, rewards which has given me a lot of confidence. I am very grateful for whatever I have achieved and when I look back, I can tell that yes I have done whatever I could.""Sindhu reflects on the valuable lessons learned throughout her career, highlighting patience as the most significant. She acknowledges both wins and losses as part of the learning process.""Being patient. That has taught me a lot in life, being patient and wait for the right time because sometimes game teaches you to be patient no matter what.""You have to keep waiting till you get whether it is success or whether it is the right time or whether it is the right shot... you have to wait for the right time to do the right thing.""Sindhu said self-belief is something an athlete can't do without, indicating that she is trying to overcome the ongoing tough phase with the same virtue.""It hits you when you are actually not able to win or not able to get that success or when you are actually at your lows. That is when it is important for an athlete to stay there and keep believing in yourself. There were days when I lost matches which were very very close.""There were days where I was like why am I losing, what is happening, can I bounce back, can I come back stronger and especially lowest is when it hits you really hard. I was doubting myself but people around me were very very supportive in terms of they were like it's okay, believe in yourself, you can do it.""I am very lucky to say that I have parents who are sports persons and they know what it is and what it takes because they have experienced so much that they tell me that this is what happens and you need to be stronger and you need to come back stronger.""Sindhu candidly admits that accepting defeat remains difficult, even with her extensive achievements. She still finds losses challenging.""It does hurt, it does hurt at any point of time even though let's say if you don't have to prove anything, or if you have achieved everything and what is left you might ask me what else is left?""For me I feel that there is a lot of time left and I can win a lot of tournaments and I can play for so many more years because if you are fit and if you are injury free I think passion towards the sport itself will take you much more longer.""Sindhu stresses the importance of a strong coach-athlete relationship built on understanding and trust. She emphasizes clear communication.""A coach needs to understand even if I am not able to say what is happening in the court. As a coach you know he understands what you feel. So it is very important to also have that trust between a coach and an athlete.""Sindhu has a clear plan for the 2025 season when she will compete in select tournaments to avoid injuries.""There are a lot of tournaments every month. We are out for like 15 days, 20 days. Definitely I will pick and choose a tournament because as you said I need to stay injury free. That is very important. If you stay injury free that's when you go and give your 100%.""There are some tournaments where BWF says that you have to play, but apart from that, the players are also smart enough to pick and choose tournaments.""Sindhu said she is still evolving as a player, working on her skills because ""the game has been changing so much.""""People have become really strong in their defense so to break that, you have to work on that. You have to also work on defense. Not everyone gives you chance to attack. Because I'm a tall player and I have a good reach, so not everyone will give you a chance to attack, so accordingly you have to make changes.""Sindhu also hoped that the gulf between her and the next generation will be bridged sooner than later.""I am hoping that the gap closes soon. There are a lot of youngsters I have seen in the Syed Modi (recent tournament she won) doing really well.""I would say Unnati and also Malavika are doing really well right now. Shreyanshi is doing really well so there are so many. If I have to name, there is Tanvi Sharma also.""It's very, very important to have the right guidance. Especially to the parents out there, I want to say that if they feel by putting their kids into academies from where successful athletes have come, their kids will also become champions is not right.""Every athlete has a different mindset, every athlete has a different style of play, different thinking, so they need to understand that.To conclude, Sindhu said that what is common between her and PUMA is ""commitment towards the sport.""","PV Sindhu is one of only three Indians to win back-to-back Olympic medals. The 29-year-old has also won a world championship title and podium finishes at the Asian and Commonwealth Games. Sindhu admits that accepting defeat remains difficult, even with her extensive achievements.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117204021,imgsize-39764,width-400,resizemode-4/117204021.jpg"

Indian badminton duo Satwiksairaj Rankireddy and Chirag Shetty 's journey at the Malaysia Super 1000 tournament concluded in the semifinals. They were defeated by the Korean pair of Kim Won Ho and Seo Seung Jae .The seventh-seeded Indian pair, who were finalists in the previous edition, lost 10-21, 15-21 in a 40-minute match.“They played really well, and we could have followed our game plan a bit better. Instead, we played some random strokes, but kudos to them for playing a solid game.”Satwik acknowledged the Koreans' strong performance and admitted their own shortcomings in executing their strategy. He also praised the opponents' solid gameplay.“Today, the pace of the game was very slow compared to the last three days. It’s part of the game. It was a valuable learning experience for us. It is disappointing, but we have a long way to go. Today’s match showed that we can still make it a good fight.”Satwik reflected on the slower pace of the game compared to previous matches. He emphasized the learning experience and the positive takeaway of being competitive despite the loss.The Asian Games champions faced an early setback, trailing 6-11 at the mid-game interval of the first game.They couldn't recover from the deficit, and the Korean pair secured the first game swiftly in 19 minutes.In the second game, Satwik and Chirag displayed improved control and intent. They took an 11-8 lead at the interval.However, they lost momentum, enabling the Korean duo to regain control and win the match comfortably.Kim and Seo have rejoined forces for the 2025 season after achieving success with different partners.Seo won the world title with Kang Min Hyuk in 2023 and previously attained a world No. 7 ranking with Choi Sol Gyu. Kim secured a mixed doubles silver medal with Jeong Na-eun at the Paris Olympics.“They both are playing like a mixed doubles pair now, which is making it tougher.”Satwik humorously observed the playing style of the Korean pair, comparing it to a mixed doubles partnership, which posed a greater challenge.“They are not giving away any easy points, and that’s their best quality. We have to work hard for every point, and that’s exactly what happened today.”He highlighted the Koreans' strength of not conceding easy points, forcing them to work hard for every point.Satwik, whose participation has been limited after the Paris Games due to injuries, suggested that a more assertive approach and mind games might have been beneficial.“We were working really hard, but they were taking easy points whenever they wanted, which kept the pressure off them. In the first game, and even in the second, despite us leading, they maintained their confidence.”Satwik pointed out that despite their efforts, the Koreans' ability to score easy points kept the pressure off them and maintained their confidence.“They could take any point at any time. I think maybe some mind games could have worked here and there. We started a bit calmer, thought the game would come to us, but we could have shown a little more attitude on the court and played with a little more fire.”He reflected on the need for a more aggressive and strategic approach from the start of the match.“I think we started to be a little calmer in the second game. But credit to them, I think we gave away a few easy points from 11-8, but they were also serving quite well.”Chirag acknowledged their calmer approach in the second game but credited the Koreans' serving and their own errors.Satwik and Chirag haven't played extensively since the Olympics.Their next tournament is the India Open Super 750 , commencing on January 14. They will face Malaysia's Wei Chong Man and Kai Wun Tee in the first round.“Really excited. It’s our home tournament and we would really want to go, play well there, and go as deep into the tournament as possible.”Chirag expressed his excitement about playing in their home tournament and their aim to perform well and progress as far as possible.","Satwiksairaj Rankireddy and Chirag Shetty lost 10-21, 15-21 to Kim Won Ho and Seo Seung Jae.

PRASIDH’S HIGHS & LOWS IN ENGLAND

As Mohammed Siraj soaked in the applause and Shubman Gill became the toast of a nation, Prasidh Krishna appeared to slip quietly away from the spotlight, reflecting on his eight-wicket masterclass in India’s nerve-wracking, series-levelling win against England at the Oval.It was a career-defining performance that could potentially earn him the rite of passage into India’s elite pace group, alongside Jasprit Bumrah and Siraj. The England series was a baptism by fire for the 29-year-old Karnataka speedster. It began on a harrowing note, with Prasidh being guilty of spraying the ball all over the place and leaking one boundary every eight deliveries in the first three Tests of the high-octane series.Like most tall bowlers from the subcontinent, Prasidh tends to bowl short of a length and hits the deck hard in search of discomforting bounce. The flat tracks in England didn’t help his cause, making him too predictable.“In the initial tests in England, he struggled to hit the right lengths. He had pace but was way too short. This is why you saw England batters either pulling him or flicking him,” former India and Delhi pacer Sanjeev Sharma told TOI.The team management, however, showed faith in and drafted him in for the crucial final Test. Prasidh justified the faith by playing a major role in India’s win.It wasn’t easy for Prasidh personally — he had to go against the grain and reset some of his deeply-embedded muscle-memory patterns. “In England, you need to pitch it up and bowl fuller in order to invite the batters to drive. Prasidh got those eight wickets at the Oval because he mixed his lengths cleverly. It was commendable because he is wired to bowl short of a length,” Sharma said.Anutosh A Poll, a former Karnataka team manager, is someone who has seen Prasidh since his formative years in the domestic circuit. Poll is, expectedly, chuffed at the pacer’s evolution. “I was amazed to see the way he bowled in England. Prasidh has grown in confidence and is part of the big league now. At the Oval, he was varying his lengths cleverly and not being predictable. The wickets of Jacob Bethell on Day 4 and Josh Tongue on the final day stood out for me,” Poll said.Boasting a high release point, combined with the ability to marry seam movement with bounce, makes Prasidh a wonderful proposition. Nevertheless, he needs to remain consistent and adapt to different conditions. Beyond his physical attributes, Prasidh also displayed commendable mental fortitude in England, especially after having spent months on the sidelines due to a series of stress fractures and quadricep tears. “It remains to be seen how he performs in India and in the subcontinent, where conditions are not ideal for his style of bowling,” Sharma added.Indeed, going forward, how he performs in India will decide whether he can be an integral part of the team in all conditions. The home season later this year will be Prasidh’s litmus test. Till then, let us savour his lion-hearted efforts at the Oval.- Prasidh Krishna produced his best bowling performance in the first innings of the Oval Test. With another four-wicket haul in the second innings (4/126), he also recorded his best Test figures in a match (ER 4.37).- Prasidh’s 8/188 and Mohammed Siraj’s 9/190 in the Oval Test was the first instance of two Indian fast bowlers bagging four wickets each in both innings of a Test.- Prasidh’s economy rate while conceding 128 runs and claiming three wickets off 20 overs in the first innings of the Leeds Test, the worst by an Indian bowler delivering 120 balls or more in a Test innings. The previous record belonged to Varun Aaron, who had an economy rate of 5.91 during his figures of 23-1-136-2 vs Australia in Adelaide in Dec 2014. Prasidh’s match economy rate of 6.28 in the same Test (35-0-220-5) is the worst by any Indian bowler conceding 200-plus runs in a match.(Stats: Rajesh Kumar)",Prasidh Krishna put on a much-improved show at The Oval.

Poll Do you think wicketkeepers have an advantage in playing against wrist spinners? Yes, definitely No, not really

NEW DELHI: Former India wicket-keeper batter Dinesh Karthik has offered a masterclass on how to handle the modern generation of wrist spinners — with Afghanistan’s Rashid Khan at the forefront — and explained why wicketkeepers often have an edge in reading them.Speaking on Sky Sports, Karthik said wicketkeepers’ familiarity with wrist spin gives them a subconscious advantage. “I would say if you read it better, the one shot most keepers play really well is the sweep shot. Sometimes they don’t have any other shot other than that, but that they do nicely, and hence playing spin comes slightly more easily. Also, you gotta understand when you do keeping, you do so much of it to wrist spinners. Subconsciously, it’s embedded in your mind as to what you want to pick,” Karthik explained.He also highlighted the physical aspect of keeping: “We’re slightly ahead of the normal batter in playing wrist spin at times. And the fact that we have a lot of lower body strength, so we stay slightly crouched at our crease, so we pick up cues much better than a lot of others.”Taking Rashid Khan as an example, Karthik pointed out an interesting statistic — only one wicketkeeper-batter appears in the list of top five players who have performed well against the Afghan star: “If you see that stat, he’s [Sanju Samson] the only wicketkeeping batsman who’s on that, which tells you that batters have gotten really good as well.”As for a key technical takeaway, Karthik said the slog sweep — played with a flat-batted swing — remains one of the most effective tools. “Flat batted swing always negates how much spin there is on the pitch. And that is a very useful tool to have when you play some of these wrist spinners,” he concluded.",Former India wicket-keeper batter Dinesh Karthik has offered a masterclass on how to handle the modern generation of wrist spinners.

Poll Do you believe that watching great performances can inspire young athletes? Yes, absolutely No, it's overrated

NEW DELHI: India wicketkeeper-batter Sanju Samson has revealed that Sachin Tendulkar ’s legendary “Desert Storm” innings in Sharjah in 1998 was the moment that convinced him he could one day play for India.The knock — 143 off 131 balls against Australia — is remembered as one of Tendulkar’s most iconic efforts. Although India lost that match, Sachin’s brilliance ensured qualification for the finals. For a young Samson, it was a turning point.“I was watching a game sitting in Delhi police quarters or police colony room on a small TV. Sachin sir was batting in that game, the Sharjah storm innings, he was just smashing the bowlers. So, that moment it actually struck me that ‘Sanju, you can also do that’. That actually inspired me the most,” Samson said in a conversation with R Ashwin.The Rajasthan Royals skipper, who joined the franchise in 2013, recalled how his early career was shaped by opportunities created by senior players. Before RR, Samson had a stint with Kolkata Knight Riders but did not break into the playing XI. His breakthrough came after impressing former Kerala teammate S Sreesanth , who later introduced him to Rahul Dravid during RR trials.“Rahul sir used to just practice, practice, practice, and that is how I saw him when I was a 14-year-old kid. The second time was when Sreesanth bhai took me to the RR trials at the age of 17. He used to take 5-7 players from Kerala every year for trials. We used to play Ranji together, and one game he did not see me in the team. So, he called up the secretary and asked why is Sanju not in the team. Next day I flew to play against Andhra, and I scored a 100 in front of him,” Samson said.Samson played for RR from 2013 to 2015, returned in 2018 after a stint with Delhi Daredevils, and has since become the face of the franchise — but it all started with that one stormy day in Sharjah.","India wicketkeeper-batter Sanju Samson has revealed that Sachin Tendulkar ’s legendary ‘Desert Storm’ innings in Sharjah in 1998 was the moment that convinced him he could one day play for India.

Poll Who was the standout bowler for India in the recent Tests? Mohammed Siraj Jasprit Bumrah Other bowlers Not sure

Former Australia captain Michael Clarke has lauded Mohammed Siraj for stepping up in the Oval Test, while also lambasting critics for questioning Jasprit Bumrah's professionalism.Several former cricketers and cricket pundits have criticised India's spearhead Jasprit Bumrah for playing only three out of five Tests in the recently concluded Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy.“To win the last match and level the series — wow! Phenomenal, absolutely brilliant. And here’s the other thing: in the two Test matches that India won, the best bowler in the world, Jasprit Bumrah, didn’t play,” Clarke said on the Beyond23 Cricket Podcast.“Bumrah didn’t play the two Test matches that India won. So, to the other bowlers in the Indian squad — they deserve a lot of credit for stepping up.“And I do believe, and I don’t think anybody would disagree, that any team with Bumrah in it is a better team. But to be able to win those two matches without him, that bowling attack deserves a lot of credit.”Talking about India’s hero Mohammed Siraj, the former Australia captain said: “India bowling again — Krishna, Siraj.Wow! I feel like every time Bumrah is not around, Siraj has this ‘I’ve got to stand up’ mindset and attitude.“He wants the ball when the team is under pressure. I feel like he’s a better bowler when there is more expectation and pressure on his shoulders.“I think he really enjoys that role in the team.

Poll Should physiotherapists have a say in team selection? Yes, they play an important role. No, selection should be left to coaches and selectors.

India recently concluded a 2-2 Test series against England, marking one of their most notable overseas performances. The series featured Jasprit Bumrah 's comeback after recovering from a back injury that had sidelined him during last year's Australia series.Bumrah participated in three out of five matches due to workload management concerns, claiming 14 wickets with two five-wicket hauls. Several cricket legends, including Sunil Gavaskar , have expressed concerns about workload management.Former Indian cricketer Sandeep Patil shared his views on workload management during an interaction with Mid-Day.""Workload management is nonsense. You are either fit or unfit, and that's how we [his selection committee] picked teams. We did not entertain this workload business. Modern-day players have all the facilities. We did not have such rehab programmes in our playing days. At times, we carried on playing despite injuries. Let's just say we were happy playing for the country… no naatak,"" said Sandeep.Patil questioned the BCCI 's stance on workload management and the role of physiotherapists in team selection.""I wonder how the BCCI is agreeing to all this.Is the physio more important than the captain, than the head coach? What about selectors? Are we to expect that the physio will be sitting in selection committee meetings now? Will he decide?"" he asked.Patil emphasised the importance of dedication when representing the national team.""When you are picked for your country, you die for your country. You are a warrior. I have seen Sunil Gavaskar bat on all five days of a match, I've seen Kapil Dev bowl on most days of a Test match, and even bowl to us in the nets. They never asked for breaks, never complained, and their careers extended to 16-plus years. I didn't miss the next Test after my head injury in Australia in 1981.""Patil cited examples of cricket legends Sunil Gavaskar and Kapil Dev, who consistently performed without requesting breaks.

Poll How impressed were you with Zakary Foulkes' debut performance? Very impressed Somewhat impressed Not impressed

New Zealand captain Mitchell Santner praised his team's bowling performance after their victory against Zimbabwe, particularly highlighting their first innings effort.New Zealand secured their largest Test cricket win, defeating Zimbabwe by an innings and 359 runs at Bulawayo on Saturday. The victory featured centuries from Devon Conway Henry Nicholls , and Rachin Ravindra, along with a remarkable bowling spell by Zakary Foulkes.The win marks New Zealand's 2-0 series triumph and stands as the third-largest victory margin in Test cricket history. Only England's innings and 579-run win over Australia in 1938 and Australia's innings and 360-run victory against South Africa surpass this margin.“A great game in all aspects. We were challenged at times throughout the game, and I guess we kind of got through those periods by cashing in on it. I think the way we bowled, especially in the first innings, it was probably a little bit there, but the way we bowled Zimbabwe for 120 in that first innings, and then we could really cash in with the bat, can't really complain about anything from this game,” said Santner in the post-match press conference.“We've seen Zak in some of the white ball stuff, and I guess here, as someone kind of swinging into the right-hander is, you don't see that often,"" added Santner.“So I guess another addition to our attack with the guys who are moving the ball away. So he was outstanding, and when the lefties come on, he looks pretty tough to play. To get, I guess, nine in the game on debut is a pretty good effort.“It's obviously a nice thing to finish the tour on a win. But in that tri-series, we were challenged at different stages against two good teams in Harare, and then to score the first goal, I guess to make the final, and then to win in a close game against South Africa was cool.”“Then coming here, again, a different challenge, different surface, different conditions, and the boys looked at home and stepped up, which was great to see. I guess we will reflect on the series, the good and bad, and then we get back home, and I guess get to play in friendlier conditions than what we were going to get here.“But the way the new seam group this game stepped up, it puts us in a great position when we go home, as we've got plenty of options with the ball. Jamieson will probably be back in, Kane's back in as well with the bat, so it could be a slightly different-looking team. But guys who come in and step up straight away, it's a great position to be in,” he concluded.","New Zealand secured their largest Test cricket win, defeating Zimbabwe by an innings and 359 runs at Bulawayo on Saturday.

Egyptian football star Mohamed Salah has publicly challenged UEFA after the death of celebrated Palestinian footballer Suleiman al-Obeid, known as the “Palestinian Pelé,” in southern Gaza.On Wednesday, the Palestine Football Association (PFA) said al-Obeid, 41, was killed when Israeli forces struck a crowd waiting for humanitarian aid. The former national team striker was one of Palestine’s most gifted players, scoring more than 100 career goals and inspiring young footballers across the region.UEFA posted on X (formerly Twitter): “Farewell to Suleiman al-Obeid, the ‘Palestinian Pelé’. A talent who gave hope to countless children, even in the darkest of times.” Salah reposted the tribute with a pointed question: “Can you tell us how he died, where, and why?”Born in Gaza on March 24, 1984, al-Obeid began his career with Khadamat al-Shati before spells with Markaz Shabab al-Am’ari in the West Bank and Gaza Sport. He debuted for the Palestinian national team in 2007, earning 24 caps and scoring twice, including a spectacular scissor-kick against Yemen in the 2010 West Asian Football Federation Championship.His nickname referenced Pelé, the Brazilian icon whose artistry on the pitch became a universal symbol of football’s beauty.The PFA says his death is part of a devastating toll on Palestinian sport since the conflict began. At least 662 athletes and their relatives have been killed, including 421 footballers, among them 103 children.More than 288 sports facilities have been damaged or destroyed, the majority in Gaza, including the PFA’s own headquarters.Al-Obeid leaves behind his wife and five children.According to the PFA, over 1,300 Palestinians have been killed near aid distribution points run by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation since late May. For Salah, and many across the footballing world, the circumstances of al-Obeid’s death demand answers beyond condolences.","Suleiman al-Obeid, known as the ‘Palestinian Pelé,’ was killed in southern Gaza.

(Image: X)

Vitesse, the second-oldest professional football club in the Netherlands, has lost its professional license after a Utrecht court upheld the KNVB's decision to revoke it. The 133-year-old Arnhem club - which had seen the likes of Mason Mount, Martin Odegaard, Phillip Cocu come through the ranks - was found to have repeatedly violated licensing regulations, leading to its removal from professional football despite last-minute efforts by local investors to save the team.The Royal Dutch Football Association (KNVB) took action against Vitesse for consistently undermining the licensing system. In court, the KNVB's lawyer emphasised that the club had multiple chances to improve but failed to take them. Despite new Arnhem-based investors, known as De Sterkhouders, acquiring all shares from current owners, this wasn't enough to save the club's professional status.The judge acknowledged the unfortunate nature of the situation but stood firm on the decision. ""The societal interests put forward cannot, given the severity and duration of Vitesse's violations of the licensing system, justify overturning the decision of the KNVB appeals committee,"" the judge stated.The immediate impact of this ruling was clear - Vitesse's scheduled match against Almere City on Saturday afternoon was cancelled. The club's future remains uncertain, though management has stated they are exploring options and continuing discussions with stakeholders to maintain football in Arnhem.The court emphasised that even though Vitesse claims it can now meet professional license requirements, this doesn't erase past violations. The judge focused on historical breaches that led to the KNVB's decision, finding the football association was justified in revoking the license.The club released a statement saying they're looking into possibilities for the future while working with stakeholders to ensure football continues in Arnhem, though the exact path forward remains unclear.","Dutch football club Vitesse, the second oldest in the country, has gone out of business. The 133-year-old Arnhem club was found to have repeatedly violated licensing regulations, leading to its removal from professional football.

Poll How do you feel about the current state of the Indian Super League? Very concerned Somewhat concerned Not concerned at all

Eleven Indian Super League clubs have written to the All India Football Federation, urging them to bring the current uncertainty over ISL's future to the Supreme Court 's attention. The clubs warned they would seek independent judicial intervention if AIFF fails to act, following FSDL's decision to pause the 2025-26 season due to uncertainty over the Master Rights Agreement renewal. Mohun Bagan Super Giant and East Bengal were the only ISL clubs that did not sign the letter.The development occurred after AIFF proposed organizing the Super Cup in September to ensure clubs get sufficient competitive matches. This proposal came after ISL organizers FSDL put the league on hold due to uncertainty regarding the MRA renewal.The Supreme Court had previously directed AIFF not to negotiate new terms of the MRA with FSDL until a final judgment is delivered in the AIFF draft constitution case.""We respectfully urge the AIFF, in its capacity as the statutory regulator of football in India and the principal party to the proceedings, to urgently bring the current situation to the attention of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India ,"" the 11 ISL clubs stated in their joint letter to AIFF president Kalyan Chaubey.""This may be done by mentioning the matter for urgent listing and judgment and apprising the Hon'ble Court of the current situation to ensure that the ISL and associated competitions may proceed.We believe such a step is both legally permissible and in the interest of safeguarding Indian football, the AIFF's own regulatory mandate, and the welfare of all stakeholders involved.""The clubs expressed surprise that the matter hadn't already been brought to the Court's attention, given its significance for the sport.""During the last hearing before the Hon'ble Supreme Court, the Hon'ble Judges orally observed that no major decisions should be taken until final orders are passed, which has resulted in a de facto holding pattern for the Indian Super League and associated football activities. This legal uncertainty and administrative vacuum are now threatening to cause irreversible damage to the Indian football ecosystem. Clubs are unable to plan or invest, commercial contracts are on hold, and the livelihoods of thousands of players, staff, support personnel, and stakeholders are at immediate risk. Moreover, this situation could seriously derail the momentum of football development in the country.""The clubs offered to support AIFF legally while making their stance clear about approaching the Supreme Court independently if needed.""We would be happy to support the AIFF legally and work jointly towards this, in a manner that protects the interests of Indian football and all its constituents. It is in the best interest of all concerned that the AIFF, as the main party and regulator, takes immediate initiative in this regard. Based on legal advice, the ISL clubs are preparing to independently approach the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India for relief. However, given that the clubs are not formal parties to the current proceedings, this may not be the most efficient or effective route to resolve the situation. Should the AIFF choose not to act, we reiterate that the ISL clubs will have no option but to seek judicial recourse independently, to protect the integrity of the League and the interests of the sport.""The ISL typically runs from September to April, with the current MRA between FSDL and AIFF set to expire on December 8, 2025.The uncertainty has already impacted several clubs. Chennaiyin FC recently announced a temporary suspension of operations for their first-team players and staff.

LIVERPOOL: Liverpool manager Arne Slot refused to rule out an improved bid for Newcastle's Alexander Isak as the Premier League champions consider adding to their formidable firepower, with Darwin Nunez set to leave for Saudi Arabia. After a quiet first year in the transfer market under Slot the Reds have spent almost £300 million ($402 million) on forwards Florian Wirtz and Hugo Ekitike as well as full-backs Milos Kerkez and Jeremie Frimpong.Nunez is one of a number of significant exits that will help recoup much of that outlay as the Uruguayan closes in on a £46 million move to Al Hilal.Liverpool reportedly had a £110 million bid for Isak turned down by Newcastle, who are seeking a British transfer record fee.The Swedish striker has not been part of the Magpies' pre-season preparations and has been told to train on his own by Newcastle.""You never talk about players that are not yours,"" Slot said at his pre-match press conference ahead of Sunday's Community Shield against Crystal Palace at Wembley, the traditional curtain-raiser for the season.""I think we have a lot of attacking power in our team. When I think about Cody Gakpo, Federico Chiesa, Hugo Ekitike, Mo Salah, Jeremie Frimpong, who can play as a right-winger, Florian Wirtz, who can play as a left-winger, -- I already feel I have a lot of attacking options in my current squad.""But, as always as a club, we are always looking at the chances in the market.""Liverpool celebrated a record-equalling 20th English top-flight title but were devastated last month by the death of forward Diogo Jota.The Portuguese international was killed in a car accident alongside his brother in northern Spain as he began to make his way back to England for pre-season.A series of tributes have been paid to Jota at every Liverpool game since and will continue throughout the season.A ""Forever 20"" emblem, referencing Jota's now-retired shirt number, will be printed on Liverpool's shirts this season, while a permanent memorial will be installed at Anfield.""First of all, tragedy impacted us but it impacted far more his wife, children and parents,"" said Slot.""But it impacted us as well, definitely. The tributes that have been done since were all very emotional and impressive, every time we were somewhere.""It started off in Preston and in Asia as well.

How the three World Champions fared in Formula E Season 11

Days after Oliver Rowland lifted his Formula E World Championship trophy in London this season, an interesting trend has come to the attention of Formula E and its fans. As a coincidence, all Formula E drivers who won the Mexico City E-Prix went on to win the Formula E World Championship that season, and this has been proved right for three consecutive years.Highlighting the same since 2023, a poster of three World Champions was shared on X by Formula E with the caption, “The trend continues. Each winner of the #MexicoCityEPrix from the past three seasons has gone on to become World Champion.”The special poster features 2023 Formula E World Champion Jake Dennis from Andretti, then TAG Heuer Porsche’s Pascal Wehrlein, who won in 2024, and the new World Champion, Nissan driver Oliver Rowland.

He was leading the Formula E Driver Standings ever since he won Part 2 of the Jeddah E-Prix, which was his second win of the season after winning the Mexico E-Prix. In the last leg, the Nissan driver got nervous for a while as Pascal Wehrlein, who was following him in the number two position, closed the gap after grabbing quite a few podiums while Rowland had a dull period.Things became serious for Rowland when he failed to finish the Round 13 race in Berlin, while Wehrlein won second spot on the podium. But he eventually managed to confirm his championship in Berlin after four wins and three more podiums.Sharing about his bad race in Berlin, Rowland had said, “I was hoping before the weekend that the outcome could be [the World Championship], but after yesterday (Saturday) and this morning (Sunday), I was more worried that it might never come.”Also Read: Oliver Rowland reacts to daughter’s sweet radio message after Formula E Championship win: “It’s amazing” Things, however, changed for Wehrlein, who was pushed to third position after Nick Cassidy made a late entry in the Formula E Driver Standings by registering three consecutive wins.

Taylor Barnard on losing top three spot in Formula E World Championship

Fans hail Taylor Barnard for his fantastic rookie season

It was Taylor Barnard’s rookie season this year, and the NEOM McLaren driver put up a fantastic performance by temporarily making it to the top three in the Formula E Driver Standings by ousting the much more experienced Porsche driver Antonio Felix Da Costa. He was, however, ousted from the top three at the London E-Prix as Jaguar’s Nick Cassidy went on to register three consecutive wins. Barnard took to Instagram to share his feelings on losing out on the top three in his first-ever season and his claim to the championship.Taking to Instagram after the London E-Prix, Barnard wrote, “London wasn’t what we hoped for, easily being the toughest weekend of our season. Taking 0 points away as a team from a doubleheader hurts, but one weekend doesn’t define the year we’ve had.”He further wrote, “As the season closes, I want to say a massive thank you to the entire team, both trackside and behind the scenes, for everything this season. Finishing P4 in the Drivers’ Championship and coming into the final weekend with a shot at runner-up is something to be proud of.”Also adding a note for teammate Sam Bird, as NEOM McLaren withdrew from Formula E after the end of the season, Barnard wrote, “@sambird_official it wasn’t the weekend you deserved either.You’ve been a huge part of my season both on and off the track, and I’m grateful for everything. You deserved more. To all the Papaya fans, thank you for the incredible support in our final race together. You always go above and beyond. ”Reacting to his post, a fan wrote, “An incredible debut season, huge congrats and excited to see where you go next!” Another said, “I know I said it the other day, but you’ve been incredible to watch this last year and a pleasure to support you in Papaya — there are many of us that can’t wait to support you in whatever you do next!” One more commented, “You were incredible all season around, Taylor. Massive congratulations. You are the future of this sport.”Recalling Barnard’s maiden pole, a fan also wrote, “Fantastic season, Taylor, we'll never forget that Monaco pole.”Also Read: Taylor Barnard looks back at rookie season at McLaren: “Every step has been unforgettable” Barnard claimed five podiums in his first full season in Formula E.

What’s next in Formula E?

Addressing the Papaya Army, James thanked them for their trust and support as the team went on to win two Drivers’ World Championships and two Teams’ World Championships over 103 races in seven seasons.Ian James began the letter saying that he wrote it with “a huge amount of pride, as well as with more than a hint of sadness,” as the team closed the final chapter after seven years of competing in the ABB FIA Formula E World Championship.Thanking the fans for their love on social media and at the track, he said, “The team was always blown away by the amount of papaya we saw at circuits across the world, race-in, race-out, right from our very first round as the NEOM McLaren Formula E team. Through the early days, the good days, the bad days, and the great days, we have always felt an overwhelming amount of support from you all.”For the partners associated with the team, he wrote, “They say that ‘racing is a state of mind’, and since its inception, this team has had the privilege of working for organisations, with partners, and racing for fans who fully embrace this philosophy.This is certainly true of those at McLaren, whose passion for racing is second to none.”“My heartfelt thanks go out to everyone who has been involved: those at McLaren who backed us, the fans who supported us, and the partners who allowed us to go racing. We couldn’t have done it without you all — your trust and support have never been taken for granted,” he added.Praising the two McLaren drivers, he wrote, “Sam clinched McLaren’s first-ever fully electric win at the São Paulo E-Prix in Season 10, pulling off one of Formula E’s all-time great overtakes, before being waved across the line by none other than Emerson Fittipaldi – McLaren's first Formula 1 World Champion. While Taylor has been a rookie sensation in Season 11, securing five Formula E records, including the youngest driver to start a race, the youngest points scorer, the youngest driver to lead a lap, the youngest podium finisher, and the youngest polesitter. ”He ended the letter saying, “Some of us have been together since the day we first launched this team, while others have seamlessly fitted in along the way and flourished within the environment we have cultivated. For many, I am sure that we will cross paths again soon, but whatever the future holds for those here at Bicester, whatever path they choose to follow, I have no doubt that it will be bright. Their potential is limitless. ”Reacting to the open letter on Instagram, Taylor Barnard wrote, “It’s been an honour to wear Papaya and represent this team.” Sam Bird also dropped a heart emoji and a hands-joined-in-prayer emoji in the comments section.Also Read: Taylor Barnard looks back at rookie season at McLaren: “Every step has been unforgettable” Neither Taylor Barnard nor Sam Bird has revealed their future course of action in Formula E Season 12.

How do Formula E and ABB work together?

What do ABB and Formula E say about the partnership?

After a successful Season 11, ABB and Formula E have announced that they will continue their partnership in the upcoming season. This gives ABB another opportunity to promote its new brand positioning via the ABB FIA Formula E World Championship, along with technologies that help industries take a cleaner route.Over a period of eight seasons, the partnership with Formula E has provided ABB a platform to showcase how technology can help industries outrun challenges, engage with customers around the world, and implement its own solutions into the series to improve reliability and efficiency. The partnership extension will provide a year-round opportunity for brand-building and activation, communicating ABB and its technology solutions to new global audiences, including Formula E’s international fanbase.ABB and Formula E will also join hands to engage a new generation of fans, collaborating with unexpected influencers and content creators to tell compelling stories that make advanced electrification and automation technologies tangible and exciting.The end of the mid-race car swap, a 150kW increase in power, top speeds that are 43 percent higher, and energy recovery increasing from 15 to 50 percent indicate how far Formula E technology has come to outperform on track.ABB has also built on its technical involvement in the series, supplying the race chargers from Season 9, and introducing its ABB Ability OPTIMAX® energy management software (Season 9) and Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) technology (Season 5) to the sport.ABB Head of Brand Paco Liebrand said, “We are pleased to be continuing our partnership with Formula E which, like ABB, is striving for a leaner and cleaner future. The synergy between the two organizations, combined with the global appeal of the Championship, makes it a great platform to promote our brand positioning.”He further said, “Formula E is increasingly working with content creators, influencers, and celebrities, with initiatives such as the Evo Sessions making an impact through digital channels beyond the racing itself, which is also an essential part of ABB’s new brand strategy. Going forward, we will be enhancing the way we harness the benefits of this collaboration, ensuring the focus is on delivering content and activations that reinforce our new messaging, build familiarity, and tell the ‘Engineered to Outrun’ story. ”Formula E Chief Revenue Officer Tiziana Di Gioia said, “Our renewed partnership with ABB is a testament to the commercial power and benefit of Formula E as a global platform that drives both brand and business growth. ABB, like our wider partnership portfolio, has and continues to see enormous value in collaborating with the fastest-growing motorsport on the planet, with viewership, commercial integration, and brand storytelling continuing to accelerate. Over eight seasons, ABB has moved from brand visibility to brand activation—integrating deeply into the fan experience, the sport’s ecosystem, and our innovation narrative.Also Read: Antonio Felix Da Costa shares happy memories as Porsche wins Formula E Teams and Manufacturers’ World Championships “This next chapter elevates the partnership even further. With ABB’s new positioning, we are co-creating opportunities across content, digital storytelling, and market engagement, transforming a title partnership into a year-round, value-generating relationship. It’s a model of how modern sponsorships should evolve, rooted in purpose and cultural alignment but measured by impact,” she added.Formula E Season 12 will begin with testing in Valencia in October.","ABB and Formula E have announced that they will continue their partnership in the upcoming season.

Toronto:

Four-time Grand Slam champion Naomi Osaka and Canadian teen sensation Victoria Mboko booked a championship showdown with gritty semi-final wins on Wednesday in the WTA Canadian Open in Montreal.Japan's Osaka, chasing her first tour-level title since the 2021 Australian Open, saved a pair of set points in the second-set tiebreak to polish off a 6-2, 7-6 (9/7) victory over Denmark's Clara Tauson -- who was coming off victories over Wimbledon champion Iga Swiatek and Australian Open winner Madison Keys.Mboko saved a match point in a thrilling 1-6, 7-5, 7-6 (7/4) victory over former Wimbledon champion Elena Rybakina.The 18-year-old wild card fed off the energy of the crowd, crediting ecstatic supporters with carrying her through after a tumble left her with a sore right wrist in the third set of her first tour-level semi-final.Mboko, who ousted top-seeded French Open champion Coco Gauff in the fourth round, didn't let it stop her.After going down an early break in the third set she refused to go quietly, loading up on her forehand and fending off a match point as she broke Rybakina in the 10th game to level the set.A couple of untimely double faults helped ninth-seeded Rybakina break back for a 6-5 lead, but the ninth seed from Kazakhstan was broken to love in the next game, setting the stage for the tiebreak drama."" After I had that fall I wasn't in the greatest spirits, but I'm happy that I kept my composure and I was kind of patient in the right moments,"" said Mboko, who won the last three points of a decider she called ""stressful"".""Anything can happen,"" an exhausted Mboko beamed as the crowd's cheers rained down on her.""Unfortunately I fell, but I had everyone supporting me and pushing me.""Mboko started the season ranked outside the top 300 but had worked her way up to 85th coming into the week by grinding away in lower-level tournaments.She is assured of breaking into the top 40 no matter the result against Osaka, a former world number one who has struggled to find consistency since returning from maternity leave in 2024 after more than a year away.Osaka has looked re-energized this week after a coaching shakeup and rolled through the first set against Tauson.But Tauson twice regained a break in the second set as she pushed it to the tiebreaker where she had chances to level the match after taking a 6-4 lead.Unable to convert her set points, the Dane saved one match point to make it 7-7, but Osaka won the next two to seal the victory and reach her first final in a WTA 1000 level event since Miami in 2022.""Definitely really happy,"" said Osaka, who started the week ranked 49th in the world. ""(I'm) excited to play my first hard court final back.""Osaka, whose performance so far this week means she's assured of rising high enough in the rankings to be seeded at the US Open later this month, was bracing for a tough match against a player who said in a youthful interview that she idolised the Japanese star.""I watched her play today because they were the match in front of us. I thought it was really impressive how she stayed calm,"" said Osaka, adding that Mboko's rebound from match point down was ""really impressive for an 18-year-old.""Karen Khachanov rallied to defeat top seed Alexander Zverev and book an ATP Toronto Masters title clash with Ben Shelton, who beat second seeded Taylor Fritz on Wednesday.Khachanov fought back from 3-1 down in the final-set tiebreaker to beat Zverev 6-3, 4-6, 7-6 (7/4).Shelton, seeded fourth, hammered Fritz 6-4, 6-3 in the first All-American Masters 1000 semifinal in 15 years to book the fifth, and most important, ATP final of his career.Russia's Khachanov, seeded 11th, had lost two previous semi-finals in Canada. But he dug deep to advance, saving a match point as he levelled the deciding set at 6-6, with world number three Zverev hammering a backhand into the top tape of the net.The German committed 44 unforced errors in the nearly three-hour defeat while Khachanov had 29 winners and 34 uforced errors.""I had to work out this match, dig deep and try my best,"" Khachanov said. ""It was very demanding physically and mentally.""We've had a lot of matches and I'm happy to beat him after losing some easy ones,"" addd Khachanov, who fell to Zverev in the Tokyo Olympic singles final. ""Today was a tough one - I was match point down.""I'm just happy things went on my side at the end.""Khachanov said it got tense at the end.""When you reach the final tiebreak, you have to play your best. You can't waste time and energy with negative thoughts or you won't succeed. You never know what will happen but you have to give it a try.""Khachanov will be playing his first final of the season after semi-final defeats in Barcelona and Halle.Shelton and Fritz had to wait out a brief delay when a problem with the electronic line calling system emerged as they took the court.But that was barely a blip for 22-year-old Shelton, the world number seven, who had beaten Alex de Minaur in the quarter-finals and with the win over Fritz notched his first back-to-back victories over top 10 opponents.US Open finalist Fritz had to save four break points in the third game of the match and was broken in the ninth game to leave Shelton to serve for the set.Shelton seized a second break for a 3-2 lead in the second, landing a perfect lob over Fritz's head and held at love for a 5-3 lead.He closed out the masterclass in with another break, Fritz mangling his racquet over his knee after he double faulted on match point.""I'm happy with my level and how I executed,"" Shelton said. ""I've seen so many big improvements in my game this week. That's what I'm most happy about, how I'm executing, how little I'm hesitating, how I'm returning.""Beating two top 10 guys back-to-back is huge for me.""I felt I had the ball on a string,"" he added. ""I'm excited to play like this, hitting the ball and expecting it to go in.""","Four-time Grand Slam champion Naomi Osaka and Canadian teen sensation Victoria Mboko book a championship showdown.

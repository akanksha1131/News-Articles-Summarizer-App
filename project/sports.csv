ICC Champions Trophy 2025: India rest & reset ahead of New Zealand clash

Pakistan's ICC Champions Trophy 2025 campaign ended in bitter disappointment as their final group stage fixture against Bangladesh in Rawalpindi was abandoned without a ball being bowled due to persistent rain on Thursday.Having already been eliminated from semi-final contention following defeats to New Zealand and India, the hosts finished at the bottom of Group A with just a single point, bringing an underwhelming end to their title defence.Reflecting on the campaign, Pakistan captain Mohammad Rizwan pointed to injuries to key players as a significant factor in their struggles, particularly the absence of Saim Ayub and Fakhar Zaman ""We wanted to do well and perform in front of our nation. The expectations were very high, but we didn't perform well, and it is disappointing for us,"" Rizwan admitted.He emphasised how Ayub's injury disrupted Pakistan's balance, stating, ""The guy who has been performing for the last few months in Australia, South Africa, Zimbabwe… the team was settled, and then suddenly when someone is injured, the team gets disturbed.""However, Rizwan refused to use the setbacks as an excuse. ""Yes, Fakhar Zaman and Saim Ayub were injured, but we will learn from this,"" he said.Ayub, who played a crucial role in Pakistan's ODI series wins in Australia and South Africa last year, was ruled out of the tournament after sustaining an ankle injury during the Proteas Test series. Meanwhile, Zaman suffered an oblique muscle strain in the opening match against New Zealand, further weakening Pakistan's top order.When asked about the strength of Pakistan's bench, Rizwan acknowledged that improvements were needed, particularly at the domestic level.""We want improvements in different areas. If we want to raise Pakistan's standards, we need awareness and professionalism. We see that in the Champions Cup, but we need more improvement,"" he remarked.With Pakistan now set to tour New Zealand for a five-match T20I and three-ODI series starting March 16, Rizwan stressed the importance of bouncing back.""We have made mistakes in the last few games. Hopefully, we can learn from them,"" he said. ""We are next going to New Zealand, and hopefully, we can perform there. The mistakes we made against New Zealand here in Pakistan, we will learn from them and do better in New Zealand.""","Pakistan's Champions Trophy 2025 campaign ended in bitter disappointment as their final group stage fixture against Bangladesh in Rawalpindi was abandoned.

On what was supposed to be a rest day for the Indian cricket team, it is reliably learnt that vice-captain Shubman Gill had an “informal training session” at the ICC Academy in Dubai on Thursday.Throwdown specialists, accompanied by some members of the support staff, were with Gill at the global cricket body’s training facility. They returned to the team hotel in their kits with the necessary gear in the evening hours.It can’t be confirmed at this stage if there were other players too, but it wasn’t a big contingent as most of the players are either in their respective hotel rooms on the rest day or out and about in the city.“Shubman Gill trained with members of the support staff for an informal session. Since it wasn’t an official training day, it looks like a personal session. But it wasn’t a marathon one and took place in the afternoon hours,” says a well placed source.India had a session under lights on Wednesday, and all players -- except Shubman Gill -- were in attendance.The Indian vice-captain made up for the missed session and trained today and will also be joining the team’s session on Friday, their last before the group stage game against New Zealand on March 2.New Zealand are scheduled to train in the afternoon while India will continue to train under lights. All eyes will be on Rohit Sharma as the Indian captain didn’t do a lot of physical activity on Wednesday and only did some light jogging under the watchful eyes of S&C coach Soham Desai.Rohit did some damage to his hamstring in the game against Pakistan, and his movements on Friday will surely give an indication on his participation for the New Zealand clash.",Shubman Gill had an ‘informal training session’ at the ICC Academy in Dubai on Thursday.

NEW DELHI: Hosts and defending champions of the ICC Champions Trophy , Pakistan, had a dismal start to their campaign, suffering a 60-run defeat against New Zealand. Their woes continued with a six-wicket loss to arch-rivals India in Dubai, effectively ending their hopes of reaching the semi-finals.Any chance of finishing the tournament on a high was also dashed when rain forced the abandonment of their final group match against Bangladesh at the Rawalpindi Cricket Ground. As a result, Pakistan finished last in the Group A standings.One of Pakistan’s key missteps in the tournament was not utilising star opener Fakhar Zaman at the top of the order.Zaman himself admitted that had he opened in their first match against New Zealand while chasing a daunting 320-run target, the outcome could have been different.During that very game in Karachi, Zaman sustained an injury and was later ruled out of the tournament due to a recurring knee issue. Imam-ul-Haq was named as his replacement.Zaman batted at No. 4, managing just 24 off 41 balls while visibly struggling, as Pakistan slumped to a 60-run loss.""Had I opened then things could have been different because when you get a big target, then the opener has a big role to play,"" Zaman said in a video posted by Pakistan Cricket Board .Zaman said he had seen a marked improvement in his injury over the week.""In the last week, I've seen a marked improvement in my healing. The doctor has said that I can start training after three weeks, so I should be back in one month.""Zaman said despite white-ball cricket being his favourite, he still wants to play the red-ball format.""I still want to play Tests but the coaches and captain have their own plans and I also feel that there are better Test players in Pakistan,"" he said, adding, ""I would like to open on my comeback but it's up to them where they want to keep me.""",Fakhar Zaman says he has seen a marked improvement in his knee injury.

Champions Trophy: Morne Morkel back as Team India practices at ICC Academy in Dubai

The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has stressed they're taking stricter security protocols at all ICC Champions Trophy 2025 venues following consecutive pitch invasions in Rawalpindi and Lahore.The first security breach happened at the Rawalpindi Cricket Stadium during the match between New Zealand and Bangladesh. A spectator ran onto the field to hug New Zealand player Rachin Ravindra. Security staff quickly apprehended the intruder, who was subsequently arrested and received a ban from all cricket stadiums.A second incident occurred at Gaddafi stadium in Lahore when a pitch invader disrupted Afghanistan's victory celebrations upon beating England on Wednesday night. While the festive atmosphere continued, this breach highlighted existing security vulnerabilities.These back-to-back pitch invasions during the tournament have placed significant pressure on the PCB. The board has now committed to enhanced security measures to protect players, officials, and spectators for the remainder of the tournament.During the incident involving Ravindra, the individual, reportedly carrying a photograph of Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan leader Saad Rizvi, managed to evade security at the Rawalpindi Cricket Ground, before being apprehended.“The PCB has taken serious note of the security breach that occurred yesterday when a spectator entered the field of play. Ensuring the safety of players and officials remains our top priority. As a responsible organisation, we have engaged with local security agencies, who have committed to increasing security personnel around the field of play at all venues and strengthening access control measures,” PCB said in a statement after the incident.“The individual involved was arrested and presented before a court of law today (Tuesday). In addition, he has been permanently banned from entering all cricket venues in Pakistan,” the statement added.“To prevent such incidents in the future, the PCB is working closely with security agencies and venue authorities to review and reinforce security protocols,” it continued.The security breach has created concerns for the PCB, with Pakistan serving as host nation for a major ICC event for the first time since the 1996 World Cup.","The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has stressed they're taking stricter security protocols at all ICC Champions Trophy 2025 venues.

NEW DELHI: Ashleigh Gardner 's outstanding all-round performance propelled the Gujarat Giants to a dominant six-wicket victory over the Royal Challengers Bengaluru in the Women's Premier League (WPL) encounter on Thursday.Gardner's blistering knock of 58 runs off 31 balls, coupled with her economical bowling figures of 1/22, played a pivotal role in the Giants' triumph.Opting to bowl first, the Gujarat Giants showcased a disciplined bowling display, restricting the Royal Challengers Bengaluru to a modest total of 125/7. Deandra Dottin (2/31) and Tanuja Kanwar (2/16) were the standout performers with the ball, while Gardner's off-spin also contributed significantly.Chasing a below-par target, the Giants lost their top-order batters cheaply, but Gardner took charge and anchored the innings with her blistering strokeplay. Her innings featured three sixes and six boundaries, as she raced to her third half-century of the tournament in just 28 balls.Gardner's aggressive approach and ability to find the boundaries at will proved to be the difference-maker in the chase.Despite the early setbacks, Gardner's partnership with the lower-order batters ensured that the Giants cruised to their second victory of the season, completing the chase in just 16.3 overs.Her ability to take calculated risks and capitalise on loose deliveries was instrumental in the Giants' successful run-chase.Earlier, the Royal Challengers Bengaluru struggled to build partnerships after losing their top-order batters early. Kanika Ahuja (33 off 28) and Richa Ghosh (22 off 19) tried to resurrect the innings, but the Giants' bowlers maintained their discipline and kept the scoring rate in check.The Gujarat Giants' bowling attack, led by Deandra Dottin and Tanuja Kanwar, consistently applied pressure on the RCB batters, making it difficult for them to score freely. Gardner and Kashvee Gautam (1/17) also contributed with economical spells, further restricting the RCB's scoring opportunities.Overall, the Gujarat Giants' comprehensive victory was a testament to their all-round performance, with both the bowlers and batters contributing significantly. Gardner's exceptional display with both bat and ball showcased her prowess as a genuine all-rounder and her ability to lead from the front in crucial situations.The win not only snapped the Giants' losing streak but also provided them with much-needed momentum as they aim to climb up the standings in the inaugural edition of the WPL. With Gardner's form and the team's renewed confidence, the Gujarat Giants will be a formidable force to reckon with in the upcoming matches.","Gujarat Giants beat Royal Challengers Bengaluru Women by six wickets.

CHENNAI: In an era when quite a few budding Indians have been moving to greener pastures to realise their dream of playing international cricket, former UAE leg-spinner Karthik Meiyappan has taken a “gamble” to return to his homeland and “explore opportunities” here.Karthik, who bagged a hat-trick against Sri Lanka in the 2022 T20 World Cup in Australia, came back to Tamil Nadu last year, with the ambition of representing the state and featuring in the IPL. The 24-year-old recently took the first big step towards achieving his targets after being picked up by Madurai Panthers in the Tamil Nadu Premier League auction.“I always wanted to come back to India, ever since I picked up cricket while growing up in Dubai. I felt that this would be the right time for me to move and give my best. Obviously, I was playing international cricket, but I wanted to take a risk to play in TN. 100%, that is the reason I made the return to Chennai (possibility of playing for TN and in the IPL),” Karthik, representing Alwarpet CC in the TNCA first division, told TOI.The leggie turned to former UAE head coach Robin Singh for advice when weighing up his options. “I had the thought for quite some time. It took me time to arrive at a decision. I played a lot under Robin, he is my mentor as well. I had chats with him. We both thought that it would be best for me to move back to Chennai,” Karthik added.Having gained much-needed experience in the one-day and T20 formats – via his involvement in international tournaments and leagues – Karthik is looking at the TN circuit as a “platform” to improve his red-ball game. “I only played white-ball cricket in the UAE, I never had the exposure of playing multi-day cricket. It has been exciting to play red-ball cricket; it took me some time to understand the multi-day concept and pick up the details. I have made progress over time,” said Karthik, who has turned out for Alwarpet in three long-format matches so far.‘Ready to compete with fellow spinners’: Karthik is well aware of the fierce competition for places among spinners in TN and is ready to battle it out.“The standard of cricket in the state is extremely high. There are a lot of spinners over here; it is a challenge to compete with them. Where there is challenge, there is growth. I am looking at the positive side of it (competition),” Karthik said.“In general, leg-spinners are a rare commodity. If I put in the performances, they could lead to more opportunities and could open doors for me.”",Former UAE leg-spinner Karthik Meiyappan has taken a ‘gamble’ to return to his homeland.

NEW DELHI: Aditya Sarwate ’s unbeaten 66 led Kerala’s fightback as they reached 131/3 at stumps on Day 2 of the Ranji Trophy final , trailing Vidarbha by 248 runs in the first innings. Earlier in the day, Kerala’s bowlers ensured the hosts were restricted to 379, preventing them from breaching the 400-run mark.Vidarbha, eyeing a total around 450 after reaching 254/4 on the opening day, were anchored by Danish Malewar’s career-best 153 and Karun Nair’s 86. However, Kerala struck back impressively, with MD Nidheesh (3/61), Eden Apple Tom (3/102), and NM Basil (2/60) combining to limit the damage.Basil provided the breakthrough by sneaking one through Malewar’s bat and pad, dismissing him for a well-made 153 off 285 balls (15 fours, 3 sixes). The biggest breakthrough, however, came when Eden Apple Tom removed Vidarbha’s in-form Yash Rathod for just three, inducing an edge to the slips. Skipper Akshay Wadkar (23) also fell to Eden, edging behind to keeper Mohammed Azharuddeen.Vidarbha’s lower order added some crucial runs, with Nachiket Bhute (32), Akshay Karnewar (12), and Harsh Dubey (12*) helping them reach 379.In response, Vidarbha struck early with the new ball. Darshan Nalkande (2/22) rattled Kerala’s top order, cleaning up openers Akshay Chandran (14) and Rohan Kunnummal (0) to leave them struggling at 14/2.However, Sarwate, once a key player in Vidarbha’s two Ranji-winning campaigns (2017-18, 2018-19), stood tall against his former team. The 35-year-old, who switched to Kerala last season, battled through testing spells to reach 66* off 120 balls, striking 10 fours.Sarwate was fortunate to survive when Vidarbha chose not to appeal for a caught-behind off Wadkar’s bowling in the 25th over—replays later showed the ball had brushed his gloves.He was well-supported by Ahammed Imran (37 off 83, 3x4s), as the duo stitched a crucial 93-run stand for the third wicket. Imran, too, had an early reprieve when substitute fielder Atharva Taide, stationed at second slip, spilled a chance off Bhute’s bowling.Despite their fielding lapses, Vidarbha managed to break the stand late in the day. Yash Thakur (1/45) outfoxed Imran, who mistimed a pull shot straight to substitute Aman Mokhade at midwicket, handing Vidarbha their third wicket.With Sarwate still holding fort, Kerala will look to build on their innings and narrow the deficit on Day 3.","Kerala reach 131/3 at stumps on Day 2 of Ranji Trophy final.

NEW DELHI: The Champions Trophy match between hosts Pakistan and Bangladesh on Thursday was abandoned without a ball being bowled due to relentless rain.In their first ICC tournament on home soil in 29 years, Pakistan’s campaign ended in disappointment, failing to secure a single victory.Bangladesh also wrapped up their winless run, heading home with plenty to reflect on.Both teams will share a point from the abandoned fixture.Pakistan have faced heavy criticism for their underwhelming performance, which included a six-wicket defeat to arch-rivals India in Dubai.This is the second washout in Rawalpindi during the tournament, following the abandoned match between South Africa and Australia earlier this week.This marks the third consecutive ICC tournament where Pakistan has failed to progress beyond the first round, following their early exits in the 2023 ODI World Cup and last year’s T20 World Cup.“It’s been shocking for us that we haven’t play well in ICC tournaments,” Pakistan assistant coach Azhar Mahmood said.Mahmood pointed out that injuries to opening batters Fakhar Zaman and Saim Ayub had a significant impact, as Pakistan's batters played a staggering 308 dot balls in their completed matches against India and New Zealand.“We have played good cricket in this format, but in this tournament it has not gone well because of injuries,” Mahmood said. “Against India we took a lot of pressure on ourselves, but we know where we need to improve. It is all about adapting and taking responsibility.”",Champions Trophy match between hosts Pakistan and Bangladesh abandoned due to rain.

Leicester's dire situation worsened as they edged closer to Championship relegation following a 2-0 defeat by West Ham on Thursday.The Hammers secured their position, rising to 15th place and establishing a 16-point cushion above the relegation zone, with goals from Tomas Soucek and an unfortunate Jannik Vestergaard own goal.The Foxes' decline has been stark since their victory in the reverse fixture during Ruud van Nistelrooy's debut match in December, with the Dutch manager recording just one draw amidst 11 losses in 13 Premier League matches.West Ham, energised by their unexpected 1-0 triumph at Arsenal on Saturday, continued their impressive form. Graham Potter 's squad demonstrated their superiority throughout the match.The scoring began when Soucek capitalised on a rebound after Leicester keeper Mads Hermansen blocked Mohammed Kudus' close-range attempt at the 21-minute mark.Just before the interval, poor defensive organisation from Leicester allowed Jarrod Bowen to strike, with his shot taking a decisive deflection off Vestergaard past Hermansen.After the break, Evan Ferguson squandered an opportunity to net his maiden West Ham goal when Wout Faes blocked his attempt.Nevertheless, the hosts had secured enough advantage to achieve consecutive Premier League victories for the first time since March 2023.The defeat leaves Leicester languishing in 19th position, five points from safety, with their return to the second division appearing increasingly likely.","West Ham beat Leicester City 2-0 at Upton Park on Thursday.

Canadian men's football team manager Jesse Marsch has spoken out against US President Donald Trump 's comments about Canada during a media event for the upcoming CONCACAF Nations League finals .Marsch, a 51-year-old American who became Canada's coach in 2024, addressed reporters on Wednesday regarding Trump 's recent statements.""If I have one message to our President, it's lay off the ridiculous rhetoric about Canada being the 51st state. As an American, I'm ashamed of the arrogance and disregard that we've shown one of our historically oldest, strongest and most loyal allies.""Since taking his current position, Marsch has gained significant insight into Canadian society and culture.""Canada is a strong, independent nation that is deep-rooted in decency. And it's a place that values high ethics and respect, unlike the polarised, disrespectful and often now hateful climate that is in the US.""""It's a place that I've learned as the national team coach where people really believe that their differences make them stronger.""Marsch highlighted that his team comprises first- and second-generation Canadians who take immense pride in representing their nation.Following Canada's successful fourth-place finish at the Copa America last year, Marsch noted that international tournaments have taken on new significance amid Trump's comments about tariffs on Canadian and Mexican goods.Recent tensions were evident during the Four Nations Face-Off ice hockey tournament, where Canada defeated the United States 3-2 in overtime.""One thing is for sure, when I look forward to a month from now I know that this will fuel our team, the mentality and will that we have to play for our country, the desire to go after this tournament in every way and to show on and off the pitch exactly what Canadian character is.""The press event at SoFi Stadium included Mexico coach Javier Aguirre and Panama coach Thomas Christiansen, where the Nations League finals will take place March 20-23.USA Soccer vice president Oguchi Onyewu attended the event but avoided political discussions.Aguirre preferred to focus on sporting matters but addressed Trump's suggestion to rename the Gulf of Mexico.""For me, it's the Gulf of Mexico, obviously,"" he said.As someone from an immigrant background, Aguirre expressed empathy for Mexicans seeking opportunities in the United States. ""It is not easy to leave your country in search of a better life for your own,"" he shared.","Jesse Marsch spoke out against US President Donald Trump's comments about Canada during a media event for the upcoming CONCACAF Nations League finals.

On March 16, they will meet Newcastle again at Wembley in the League Cup final. Mikel Arteta , the manager of Arsenal, had declared that his team would give up the title ""over my dead body"".Although the Gunners still have a match against Liverpool, Arteta could have to concede that the City Ground draw was the last straw for Arsenal's hopes of winning a first championship since 2004.At the City Ground, the toothless Gunners, who were without a known striker, only mustered one effort on goal, with Riccardo Calafiori striking the post in the first half.With just one victory in their previous five games, third-place Forest's unexpected bid for Champions League qualifying has also faltered.After recovering from an injury, Erling Haaland helped Manchester City defeat Tottenham and move into fourth place.Due to a knee injury sustained on February 15 against Newcastle, Haaland had missed City's previous two losses against Real Madrid and Liverpool.With the first-half victory in north London, the Norway star showed no signs of rust as City moved up one point above Chelsea, who were in fifth position.After a lackluster start to the season, Haaland silenced the doubters with his 28th goal in all competitions, 10 of which came in his past 11 games.This was a much-needed win for City, who had lost four of their previous six games in all competitions. They had a solid start but were fortunate to see Tottenham squander many second-half opportunities.After being sent off in the first half for his role in a disastrous Ipswich opener, Patrick Dorgu's humiliation was lessened when Harry Maguire's header gave Manchester United a hard-fought victory at Old Trafford.Maguire's header in the second half put a stop to United's three-game league losing streak and provided some respite following the club's announcement of a second round of layoffs on Monday.Even though Dorgu and goalkeeper Andre Onana made a terrible mistake that gave Jaden Philogene an early goal, Ruben Amorim managed to record just his fifth league victory as United's manager.Prior to Dorgu's night becoming worse, United had taken the lead through an own goal and an effort from Matthijs de Ligt. A VAR review later, the 20-year-old was sent out for a high challenge on Omari Hutchinson.Third-bottom Ipswich's hopes of surviving were dashed when Maguire headed in from a Bruno Fernandes corner after Philogene's cross crept in first-half stoppage time.After a 1-1 draw at Brentford, Jake O'Brien's debut goal for Everton extended their winning streak to seven league games.Brentford took the lead in first-half stoppage time thanks to Yoane Wissa's 13th goal of the season, but O'Brien tied the score in the 77th minute.",Liverpool beat Newcastle 2-0 to move 13 points clear of second-place Arsenal.

It might have something to do with the 27-year-old's catchphrase 'responsibility' which has him turning inward.Rublev is back at the Dubai Duty Free tennis championships , where he was defaulted 12 months ago, following an animated rant at a lines judge at the fag end of the semifinals. The Russian, known as much for his mercurial temper as for his penchant for self-harm, beating himself with his racket and leaving his hands and legs bloodied, spoke about his struggles with burnout and depression.""I was completely lost. I was thinking what's the purpose of living,"" said Rublev, who has battled in the dark for a few years now. ""The thing is when it happens for a few months, you still have patience (that you can overcome), but when it goes on for years you feel you cannot take it anymore.""It's like a pain,"" he said, pointing at his arm. ""It starts to grow more and more, and you want to cut the arm.""Rublev, who fell in the first round of the Australian Open , won his 17th career title in Doha last week. ""I was taking antidepressants, but after one year of taking antidepressants, I realized that in the beginning you feel a bit better, then nothing afterwards,"" he said. ""After some time I realized that while it's not getting worse, something was weird. I didn't like that feeling so I stopped taking the medication.""With the help of his charismatic compatriot Marat Safin , a former World No. 1, Rublev started finding his way back. ""Marat made me understand myself, that was a bit of a restart from the bottom. From there, little by little, I started to move in a better direction,"" he said, adding, ""I'm not in a good or a bad place (now), but I'm not feeling any more stress, I'm not feeling anxious, I'm not having depression. I'm just neutral. Not happy, not bad, but I have found a base and that's a beginning.""The main thing is to be honest with yourself,"" the World No. 9 said. ""All of us think that we (may not be) honest with people, but with ourselves we are honest. This is a huge lie because most people are not even honest with themselves. I was the same. I (thought) I have no problem saying if I'm wrong, if I'm right, if I made a mistake.""I was lying to myself about many things. I didn't even want to understand or notice it. You need someone who can make you see yourself in an honest way.""""People put masks on, they make excuses for that, I'm doing that because someone hurt me or I don't want them to see the real me.,"" he said, ""They are already lying, running away from the problem, finding an excuse. They don't want to face themselves. The first thing is to be honest with yourself, then start to be more aware.""This search for his true self is stirred by a one-word reminder - responsibility -which Rublev writes on his shoes. Every time he looks down the word stares back at him. ""I'm putting that word there to remind myself that I'm the one, it's not because of anything or anyone. If something bad or good happens to me, it's not because of luck but because I made a mistake (or did something right).

Andreeva, the only teenager in the top-100 of the rankings, was relentless in her attitude and approach even if her tennis at times was weary.The Russian noted that confidence is easy to wear when things are going your way.

""The hardest part is to be positive, to be there (in the moment) 100 per cent mentally, when things are not going your way.""For much of her near two-hours on court against the in-form Tauson, the Russian tried but couldn't produce the tennis that saw her put out three Grand Slam champions - Marketa Vondrousova, Iga Swiatek and Elena Rybakina - in a week. ""I told myself, you can either let that negativity come into your head or you can choose to fight for every point,"" Andreeva said. ""I've been listening to a lot of LeBron James interviews. He said it's easy to be confident and to play good when everything goes your way. What makes you a champion is when you're giving your best when you don't feel great. That's what I tried to do in the final.""Andreeva's goal for the 2025 season was to break into the top-10, now that she has debuted in the top tier at No.9 this week, the teenager promptly raised the bar.""The higher your ranking is, the slower the climb (becomes) because the difference in the points is very little,"" she said. ""If I win another tournament, I'm going to be top-eight maybe. If I win another tournament, I can still be top eight. It's going to be hard to enter the Top-five. That is the goal I'm going to set for myself, to be Top-five by the end of the year.""When asked what she'd do with this week's earnings of $597,000, Andreeva shrugged. She felt she had everything she needed.""I don't know what I want, I feel like I have everything. I won the tournament. I've already reached the goal that I had set for myself for the end of the year,"" she said, adding, ""My family is traveling with me. I have a great team.

It can be jewelry, a pair of jeans, socks, cap… As long as I buy something, I feel like the day is successful,"" Andreeva said, noting that her father Alexander doesn't like to shop. ""I like to buy something, even something from the grocery store.""It's easy to forget Andreeva's age when she's on the tennis court, serving big and painting the lines with her groundstrokes.

Andreeva, who had 10 aces, saved seven of eight breakpoint chances, to score a 6-3, 6-3 upset win in 97 minutes.Thursday's result was the Russian's fifth top-10 win of her career, and the second against a top-two player, following her defeat of Aryna Sabalenka in last year's Roland Garros quarterfinals.Andreeva, articulate as her shots are telling, noted that the difference between her and the elite pros was experience; the teenager turned to her coach Conchita Martinez, the 1994 Wimbledon champion, to level the playing field.""I know that no matter what's happening on the court, they (top player s) are always going to play their best tennis, and they're going to keep up their level throughout the whole match. That's the main difficulty for players that are lower ranked,"" Andreeva said.""I tell myself to fight for every ball, doesn't matter what's happening on the court,"" she said. ""I knew if I don't play aggressive she's going to go and kill me. Everybody knows that she likes to take the ball early, she doesn't give time to her opponents. She always tries to be the first one to attack. My game plan was to play my game, sometimes I just forced myself to be more aggressive.""Martinez chalks the strategy Andreeva brings to the court. ""If she didn't give me great advice and tactics I don't think I would be playing at such a high level,"" Andreeva said of the 52-year-old Spaniard, who is a calming presence at courtside. ""We take about 15 to 20 minutes to talk about the match, set up the game plan. For example, today I played at 2 (pm), we spoke at 1. It's all still fresh in my head (when I go on court).""Swiatek, who usually has a strong couple of weeks in the WTA events in the Middle East, wasn't at her best this time, falling in the semifinals to Jelena Ostapenko in Doha, and in the last-eight here in Dubai, where she looked out of sorts. The world No.2 had 31 unforced errors in the match on Thursday.""I'm not happy with the results. I feel like I under-performed,"" she said of the two weeks in Doha and Dubai. ""I need to talk with my team and plan the next weeks a bit differently because I haven't had much time to practice before these tournaments. I felt that there were some things missing (with my tennis) that should have been there.""""I wasn't really sure where my ball is going to go,"" a visibly upset Swiatek said of the match. ""I wasn't as precise as I should be. Mirra is a good player. It's not like I can win against her when I play worse."" Andreeva, looking to r each her first WTA 1000 final, will go up against sixth seed Elena Rybakina in the semifinals on Friday. Andreeva trails the Kazakh 0-1 in head-to head clashes.",Mirra Andreeva beats world No. 2 Iga Swiatek in straight sets to reach semifinals. The 17-year-old Russian had 10 aces and saved seven of eight breakpoint chances. She will play sixth seed Elena Rybakina in the semifinals on Friday.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118437872,imgsize-38286,width-400,resizemode-4/118437872.jpg"

Former Commonwealth Games badminton champion Parupalli Kashyap backed Pullela Gopichand's statement to TOI about the challenges middle-class families face in sports. He emphasised that his coach's observations accurately portray the realities of India's sporting environment.Kashyap specifically addressed the absence of support systems for athletes who don't achieve top-level success. He characterised Gopichand 's advisory as ""pragmatic, not pessimistic.""""Gopi sir's recent remarks about the challenges middle-class families face in pursuing sports as a career resonate deeply with the realities of India's sporting ecosystem,"" the 2014 CWG champion posted in 'X'.""He's absolutely right to highlight the lack of a safety net for athletes who don't reach the top. In a country where success in sports - outside of cricket - rarely guarantees financial security or societal respect, his call for caution is pragmatic, not pessimistic.""The middle class, often tethered to the promise of stable jobs and education, risks everything by banking on athletic glory when the odds are stacked against them - less than 1% make it big, and even fewer sustain a livelihood post-career.""Kashyap, who achieved career-high ranking of World No. 6 during his playing days, interpreted Gopichand's comments as a necessary call to address fundamental issues in Indian sports.""Look at the examples he cited: national champions relegated to junior clerk roles or Olympic medallists struggling in dead-end sports quota jobs, facing humiliation rather than honour.""""India's infrastructure may be improving, but without robust systems to skill up athletes for alternative careers or ensure dignity in retirement, the dream of sporting success remains a gamble most can't afford.""""Gopi sir's not discouraging passion - he's urging a hard look at the structural gaps that leave most athletes high and dry. It's a wake-up call we need to heed.""Former shuttler Guru Sai Dutt also voiced his support for Gopichand through social media.""When the fear of security and stability overshadows the passion to pursue sports, we, as a nation, fail to cultivate the right environment for the values we cherish.""""What Gopi sir is advocating for is the establishment of systems that provide support and reassurance to those fully committed to the sport, through initiatives that nurture and encourage their growth.""""His statement is not meant to discourage children from taking up the sport, but rather to call on everyone to create long-term growth opportunities. It's crucial that we all understand and make this distinction clear.""Gopichand had recently sparked debate by suggesting that middle-class families should reconsider professional sports careers due to insufficient support systems for athletes who don't reach elite levels.",Parupalli Kashyap backs Pullela Gopichand's comments about middle-class families in sports.

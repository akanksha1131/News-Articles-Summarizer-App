Poll What do you think about Dhruv Jurel's unique pre-delivery routine? It enhances his focus. It's just superstition. Routines are essential for all players. It can be distracting.

Dhruv Jurel has a unique routine. Before facing every delivery, he touches the turf, his chest, and then says a prayer.The talented UP keeper-bat is clearly a creature of habit, and routines probably help him focus better. He does the same during practice. But don’t try these routines without skill and strong basics. The Agra-born 24-year-old has a sound defensive technique that helps him keep the good deliveries away. He also has the ruthlessness to keep a flagging attack down, and like the modern T20 batter, he possesses the attacking game to break the shackles when needed.Heavily trolled during the IPL, when he was set but could not guide the Rajasthan Royals across the line in routine run-chases, Jurel was in no mood to let go of the opportunity that he had on Friday, Day Two of the first Test against West Indies at the Narendra Modi Stadium. Relishing the chance to bat at No. 5, Jurel scored 125 (210b, 15x4, 3x6) to get to his maiden Test hundred and became the 12th Indian keeper-bat to reach three figures. He also became the fifth Indian stumper (after Vijay Manjrekar, Farookh Engineer, Ajay Ratra, and Wriddhiman Saha) to score their maiden ton vs West Indies. In the process, he added a match-winning 206-run stand with Ravindra Jadeja (104*, 176b, 6x4, 5x6) for the fifth wicket.That stand and century from KL Rahul 100 (197b, 12x4) and a half-century from skipper Shubman Gill 50 (100b, 5x4) enabled India to end the day at 448/5 and a mammoth lead of 286 runs with five wickets in hand. Washington Sundar (9*) was keeping Jadeja company at stumps.Jurel, who got in the XI only because Rishabh Pant is still injured, came into the game on the back of a 140 and 56 against Australia A in Lucknow in the two games he played for India A. From the outset, he looked in good touch. He danced down the track to hit Roston Chase for two sixes over mid-wicket. Against pacers Jayden Seales, Johann Layne, and Justin Greaves, he used the batting crease well to rock back and play square off the wicket on the off side.There were shades of the 90 he scored at Ranchi against England in 2024 to rescue India from 177-7. That, though, was a crisis situation. India were chasing England’s first innings total of 353, and the series was well poised, and the UP keeper bat only had the tail for company. In Ahmedabad, the top-order had laid the platform, and the bowling attack was modest. But that is when desire and ruthlessness come to the fore. Jurel showed that. Jadeja did it too. Coach Gautam Gambhir would have liked it if captain Gill (perished to a poorly executed reverse sweep) and Rahul (gave away the chance to score a daddy hundred) had shown it too.How do you decipher what Jadeja is worth to the Indian Test side? The think tank obviously value him highly, and the selectors rewarded the Saurashtra superstar with the responsibility of being vice-captain to Gill. With 330 wickets in 86 Tests, he is fifth in the all-time list of highest Indian wicket-takers.With 3989 runs, he is 18th in the list of top run-scorers. On Friday, Jadeja once again showed why he is such an elite-level performer. Jomel Warrican had just dismissed KL Rahul with a delivery that spun and defeated the batter’s drive in the first over after lunch, as the ball landed in Greaves’ hand at extra cover. With the odd ball spinning from the rough and also keeping low, Warrican, who had been curiously used for only two overs before lunch, was a threat. Jadeja decided to counterattack.Being a spinner himself, he knows what can happen on such tracks if a spinner is allowed to settle down. The West Indies vice-captain had been bowling smartly. He kept tossing the ball up whenever he bowled wide and also bowled slower. When he bowled at the stumps, he chose to hurl darts. Jadeja hit him for two sixes in his 11th over and disturbed his rhythm, and once the accuracy vanished, the singles and twos came, and rotation of the strike with Jurel became easy. Before reaching his 50, he belted Warrican for two more sixes. All the while, as Jurel kept getting closer to his ton, the advice kept coming from the senior pro, and when he got past the mark, Jadeja celebrated it like he had scored one himself. A few minutes later, Jadeja wielded the sword to celebrate his hundred.","Dhruv Jurel scored 125 (210b, 15x4, 3x6) to get to his maiden Test hundred and became the 12th Indian keeper-bat to reach three figures. He added a match- winning 206-run stand with Ravindra Jadeja for the fifth wicket.

NEW DELHI: Two unfortunate stray dog attacks on foreign coaches at the JLN Stadium’s warm-up track on Friday morning disrupted the ongoing World Para Athletics Championships (WPAC) here, raising safety concerns for differently-abled athletes and their staff at the event, which India is hosting for the first time.Japanese fencing coach Meiko Okumatsu and Kenyan sprints coach Dennis Maragia Mwanzo were bitten by stray dogs while overseeing their athletes’ training prior to competition rounds. A security guard at one of the stadium’s entrance gates was also attacked. All three incidents occurred within 30 minutes of each other.“3 dog bites in 30 minutes. Japan, Kenya, security guard. Please ensure the dogs are taken out of the stadium. This is getting beyond alarming,” read one of the messages in the WPAC’s Local Organising Committee’s (LOC) whatsapp group.Sources told TOI that this was the fifth dog bite incident at the JLN stadium during the championships. Previous attacks involved security guards, volunteers, and stadium officials. “The matter was never highlighted. It was kept under wraps. The Sports Authority of India (SAI)-run medical centre at the JLN premises for this event was aware of those incidents.Since this time, it involved the foreign officials (coaches) and their team members, the issue came out in public,” said a source.TOI exclusively accessed the ‘medical incidence report’ detailing Friday’s incidents, prepared by the medical team. “The incident involving Meiko Okumatsu, coach, NPC Japan, happened at 9:18 am on the JLN’s warm-up track. Okumatsu was seated at the warm-up track, supervising the training of her athlete, when she sustained a dog bite in the left calf posterior aspect. The incident occurred in an unprovoked manner as reported by the witnesses present at the site. It’s a lacerated wound. The wounds (7x5x3 cm and 3x3x1 cm) were cleaned and dressed in accordance with anti-rabies management guidelines. Following consultation, Okumatsu was referred to the anti-rabies clinic at the Safdarjung hospital for vaccination, treatment and further management. She was given the anti-rabies vaccine (ARV), Immunoglobulin injection and tetanus,” the report stated. Stitches were applied to both her wounds due to their depth and the extent of flesh removed by the dog bites.In Mwanzo’s case, the incident occurred at 9:42 am while assisting para athlete Stacey Obonyo during her 200m warm-up. “Maragia sustained a dog bite in the posterior aspect of right calf. The wound had dimensions of 2x2x1 cm, and he was given treatment in accordance with anti-rabies management guidelines,” the report added.The WPAC’s organising committee later issued a statement attributing the incidents to individuals feeding stray dogs near the venue.“On Aug 21-2025, a formal request was made to the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) to safeguard the JLN stadium by removing stray dogs from the venue. The MCD cleared the premises well before the start of the championships, and dog-catching vehicles have been stationed at the stadium from Day 1 to ensure constant vigilance and immediate response. Despite these precautionary measures, the challenge of individuals repeatedly feeding stray dogs near the venue has allowed animals to re-enter the premises. Unfortunately, this led to two isolated incidents at the warm-up track with coaches of Japan & Kenya getting bit. The stadium and surrounding areas have been fully sanitised in coordination with civic agencies, and strengthened preventive measures are now in place to ensure uninterrupted, secure conduct of the championships,” the statement added.Public health data released by the govt indicated that India recorded 37.17 lakh dog bite cases in 2024, averaging over 10,000 bites each day. The World Health Organisation (WHO), using Indian govt and other domestic sources, reported 305 rabies deaths in 2022.",Japanese fencing coach Meiko Okumatsu and Kenyan sprints coach Dennis Maragia Mwanzo were bitten by stray dogs. A security guard at one of the stadium’s entrance gates was also attacked. All three incidents occurred within 30 minutes of each other.

Poll Do you believe Abhishek Sharma made the right choice skipping his sister's wedding? Yes, for national duty. No, family should come first.

NEW DELHI: India A suffered a nine-wicket defeat to Australia A in the rain-affected second List A match on Friday, despite a gritty 94 from Tilak Varma and the personal sacrifice of Abhishek Sharma , who skipped his sister’s wedding to be part of the squad.Chasing India A’s modest total of 246, the Aussies were set 160 in 25 overs via the Duckworth-Lewis method after a three-hour rain delay. Australia A had already reached 48 without loss before the break, and once play resumed, McKenzie Harvey (70 not out off 49 balls) and Cooper Connolly (50 off 31) completed the chase in 16.4 overs.The visitors punished India’s bowling attack, hitting 22 fours and six sixes, with pacer Arshdeep Singh conceding 44 runs in four overs.While Abhishek Sharma had been drafted as a potential long-term opening option, his contribution was minimal, falling to Jack Edwards’ first delivery. Tilak Varma, however, showcased his class, holding the innings together with 94 off 122 balls, featuring five fours and four sixes. He shared a 101-run fourth-wicket partnership with Riyan Parag (58 off 54) and added lower-order contributions of 34 and 28 runs with Ravi Bishnoi and Arshdeep Singh respectively, narrowly missing out on a well-deserved century. Shreyas Iyer failed to fire, scoring only eight as India A slumped to 17 for 3 early on. Edwards was the pick of the Australian bowlers, finishing with four wickets.The defeat levels the three-match series at 1-1, setting up a high-stakes decider on Sunday. Tilak’s fluent knock reinforced his claim for India’s 50-over setup, while Abhishek’s commitment off the field highlighted the personal sacrifices young cricketers make for national duty.",Tilak Varma scores 94 as India A lose to Australia A in second List A match.

Poll How do you feel about Dhruv Jurel's tribute to the Indian Army after his maiden Test hundred? It's a touching gesture It's inappropriate for sports I don't have a strong opinion I find it inspiring and motivating

As soon as he flicked West Indies skipper Roston Chase past mid-wicket for four to reach his maiden Test hundred, Indian wicketkeeper-batter Dhruv Jurel used his bat to mimic an army march drill. It was a tribute to the Forces and his father, Nem Chand, who fought in the battle of Kargil in 1999.Nem Chand is a retired army havildar. While Jurel celebrates his 50 with just a salute dedicated to his father, the special drill was reserved for the three-figure mark if and when he got there. “The salute (celebration) after reaching my 50 was for my father, but for the hundred, it was something that I had in my mind for a very long time because I have been so close to the Indian Army . I’ve seen my father since my childhood,” Jurel said.He feels what the Forces go through cannot be compared to what the cricketers do on the field. “What we do on the ground and what they do on the battlefield is very difficult and you cannot compare that. I will always have my respect and whatever I will do in the future will be for them. I would like to dedicate this to the Indian Army for what they do,” he said further.Jurel spent most of the time on the bench as the keeping gloves are usually donned by Rishabh Pant . So the chance to bring the celebration out had to wait. How frustrating is it to keep waiting, not knowing when your chance will come? “I consider it to be a massive privilege to be involved with the Indian team whether I am playing in the XI or not.How many people get that chance? How many people get to play Test cricket?” he said after play on Day 2 of the first Test.Jurel is a process-driven athlete and a massive believer in hard work and visualisation to score risk-free runs, especially in the longer formats. Even when he knows he is not playing, he stays switched on, mentally. “I keep imagining what I would do against so and so bowler, so that when I actually get a chance, I feel that I am ready and well prepared,” he stated.Jurel also credited the help and advice he got from England legend Joe Root when he was his teammate at Rajasthan Royals during the 2023 IPL season.“Whenever I feel there is something that I need to chat about, I go to him as to what I can do with my batting and he gives simple answers as to how I can play and tackle situations. I met him in England too this year. He told me as a batter it is difficult to remain consistent, but if you keep doing the same things every day and stay disciplined, you will get the results.”","Dhruv Jurel scored his maiden Test hundred on day two of the first Test.

Women's World Cup prediction: Greenstone Lobo explains which team has best chance to win

The Indian women's cricket team encountered an unexpected visitor during their training session at the R Premadasa Stadium on Friday evening - a snake.The reptile, known as a common rat snake or ""Garandiya"" in Sinhalese, is a familiar sight at this venue, having appeared during Lanka Premier League matches and a Sri Lanka-Bangladesh ODI in July.""It's not venomous. It doesn't bite. It's a Garandiya, just looking for rats,"" a ground official said.The greyish-brown snake was observed moving along the drains and stands while the Indian players were transitioning from the centre wicket to the nets area.The presence of the reptile created a light-hearted atmosphere, drawing amused reactions from Indian cricketers, support staff, and media representatives.The Indian team is scheduled to face Pakistan in their second World Cup match at this venue on Sunday.Bangladesh dominated Pakistan, securing a seven-wicket win after chasing 130 with ease in their tournament opener, reaching 131 for 3 in 31.1 overs.Opener Rubya Haider anchored the innings with an unbeaten 54, supported by Sobhana Mostary’s 24 not out, while Shorna Akter (3 wickets), Marufa Akter, and Nahida Akter (two each) dismantled Pakistan’s 129 all-out.In Guwahati, India thrashed Sri Lanka by 59 runs in a rain-affected ICC Women’s World Cup 2025 opener.Chasing a revised DLS target of 271, Sri Lanka managed 211, with Inoka Ranaweera taking four wickets.

Poll Do you believe Dhruv Jurel can continue to perform well under pressure? Absolutely, he has the potential. Yes, but he needs more experience. It's too early to tell.

As the sun dipped low over Ahmedabad, Dhruv Jurel stood tall at the crease. His first Test century, a sublime 125, was a knock as chanceless as the soldier's drill, and as fearless as the charge into the enemy lines.The first Test cricketer from Agra, 24-year-old Dhruv wasn't just carving a place for himself in cricketing folklore, but honouring a legacy etched in sacrifice.His celebrations after reaching the coveted landmark, a sharp guard-of-honour-salute, was not for the cameras but for his father, Nem Singh Jurel — a Kargil War veteran from the Jat Regiment — the man who once wanted his son to walk the same path through the National Defence Academy.""My fifty celebration was for my father. The hundred -- that was for the Indian Army . I've seen how hard they work. What we do on the cricket field is nothing compared to their sacrifice,"" he told the media.Dhruv's childhood coach Parvinder Yadav, was ecstatic.“He looked like a 40-Test veteran. Dhruv has that rare ability to adapt, and can bat anywhere in the order. He gives the Indian team that flexibility.

In the interim, Dhruv quietly went on fine-tuning his game. ""I always tell Dhruv to make it count whenever he gets an opportunity. I'm glad he did just that today,"" Nem added.As Dhruv walked off the field, with applause ringing in his ears, one could sense what he had achieved. This wasn't just a century.

Poll Should India have accepted the Asia Cup trophy from Naqvi immediately after the final? Absolutely, it's a matter of sportsmanship No, given the political context It depends on the situation

NEW DELHI: The Asia Cup trophy controversy took a fresh twist on Friday as former Pakistan cricketer Mohammad Yousuf threw his weight behind Asian Cricket Council (ACC) and Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chief Mohsin Naqvi, who has been at the centre of the storm since India refused to accept the trophy from him after the final in Dubai.The episode unfolded after Naqvi walked away with the Asia Cup trophy following Pakistan’s defeat in the summit clash, leaving the Indian team without the trophy and winners’ medals. India’s refusal to accept the trophy from Naqvi — Pakistan's interior minister known for his anti-India political stance — has since sparked a heated debate across the cricketing world.Naqvi recently doubled down on his position, saying he is still ready to hand the trophy to India, but only if they visit the ACC office to collect it. Supporting this stance, Yousuf said on Samaa TV: “What Chairman Sir (Mohsin Naqvi) is doing is absolutely right. He has taken the correct stand. India should have taken the trophy at that moment. According to ACC and ICC rules, he was standing there as ACC chief, and the trophy should have been handed through his hands only. ”The former Pakistan batter was scathing in his criticism of the Indian players, accusing them of focusing more on theatrics than the sport itself.“At the ground, you were busy making your films. I said it that day too — they are not coming out of the filmy world. This is cricket, not movies. In movies, there are retakes, but here you are playing a genuine sport,” Yousuf said.He also stressed that Naqvi’s stand was not personal but about national pride: “Whatever he is doing for the respect of Pakistan, he is doing right, and we are with him.”With both boards refusing to back down, the Asia Cup trophy controversy shows no signs of fading anytime soon.",Mohammad Yousuf backs Pakistan Cricket Board chief Mohsin Naqvi.

The fitness transformation of Indian Cricket: From Sachin to Virat | Ramji Srinivasan Exclusive

Poll Should Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli be included in the ODI squad? Absolutely, they are vital to the team Maybe, depends on their fitness

NEW DELHI: Excitement is building in Indian cricket as fans await the official announcement of the national squad for the upcoming limited-overs tour of Australia. The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) is expected to reveal the squads on Saturday, October 4, coinciding with the third day of India’s first Test against the West Indies in Ahmedabad. All eyes are on the potential inclusion of two of India’s biggest white-ball stars, Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli , who are poised to make their return to international cricket.Both Rohit and Kohli, who had retired from T20 Internationals following India’s 2024 T20 World Cup triumph and from Tests recently, have been working intensively to regain form after a seven-month hiatus since the Champions Trophy in March.Kohli impressed with a hundred against Pakistan and top-scored in the semi-final against Australia, while Rohit ended the tournament with a match-winning knock against New Zealand in the final. Their inclusion in the ODI squad will mark their re-entry into the 50-over format, with India set to play three ODIs in Perth, Adelaide, and Sydney starting October 19, followed by a five-match T20I series from October 29 to November 8.Selectors face a challenging task, balancing workload and fitness concerns. Hardik Pandya , recovering from a quadriceps injury, and Rishabh Pant , nursing a foot fracture, will likely be unavailable. Test skipper Shubman Gill, who is leading a young batting unit against the West Indies, may also be rested for either the ODIs or T20Is to manage his workload. The compressed schedule, which includes eight matches in 19 days and multiple domestic flights, adds further complexity to squad selection.For Team India , the priority remains India’s home Tests for World Test Championship points and the T20 World Cup early next year.","The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) is expected to reveal the squads on Saturday, October 4.

No Chance for West Indies? Fans upbeat about India's opening day domination | IND vs WI 1st Test

Poll How significant do you find the role of visualization in a player's preparation? Very significant Somewhat significant Not very significant

NEW DELHI: Wicketkeeper-batter Dhruv Jurel underlined the importance of preparation and guidance as he struck his maiden Test century on Friday, helping India dominate the West Indies in the opening Test in Ahmedabad. The 24-year-old produced a 125-run knock, sharing a 206-run fifth-wicket partnership with Ravindra Jadeja to give India a commanding lead of 286 runs at stumps on Day 2.“It’s about the huge privilege even if you are not getting the chance to play. You are with the squad. How many get to be with the squad and how many get to play Test cricket?” Jurel said after the close of play. “I keep working hard because I know one day I will get an opportunity and I have to be 100 per cent ready to deliver.”Jurel revealed that a mix of discipline, routines, and visualisation keeps him ready for opportunities, regardless of how often he plays.“I do a lot of visualisation whether I am playing or not, so when I play a match, it doesn’t feel anything new. I visualise everything — from walking in to taking the stance. Nothing feels different. I am always prepared whether I am playing or not,” he said. He added that visualising field placements and risk-free scoring options allows him to contribute effectively in longer formats.The Indian keeper-batter also credited England great Joe Root for helping him fine-tune his batting approach. “Whenever I feel there is something, I go to him as to what I can do with my batting and he gives simple answers on how I can play and tackle situations. He says it is difficult to remain consistent, but you have to keep doing the same things every day and you will get the results,” Jurel said, recalling their time together during Rajasthan Royals in the IPL.Jurel’s century carried a personal touch. He dedicated it to the Indian Army and his father, a Kargil war veteran. “The salute after reaching my fifty was for my father, but for the hundred, it was something I had in my mind for a long time. What we do on the ground and what they do on the battlefield is very difficult to compare. I will always have my respect, and whatever I do in the future will be for them,” he said.With his disciplined approach, extensive visualisation, and mentorship, Jurel has demonstrated that India’s wicketkeeping and batting options remain in safe hands, ready to rise to the occasion whenever the opportunity arises.",Dhruv Jurel hits maiden Test century as India dominate West Indies.

Women's World Cup prediction: Greenstone Lobo explains which team has best chance to win

Poll Who was the standout player for England in their World Cup opener? Linsey Smith Nat Sciver-Brunt Tammy Beaumont

England opened their Women’s World Cup campaign in dominant fashion, thrashing South Africa by 10 wickets at the Barsapara Cricket Stadium in Guwahati on Friday. The contest ended well before the scheduled innings break as South Africa were bundled out for just 69, their third-lowest total in Women’s ODIs, before England chased down the target in 14.1 overs.Linsey Smith, playing her first World Cup, starred with the ball, returning with figures of 3 for 7. She removed captain Laura Wolvaardt, Tazmin Brits, and Marizanne Kapp in quick succession to break South Africa’s top order.Nat Sciver-Brunt (2/5), Sophie Ecclestone (2/19) and Charlie Dean (2/14) added to the damage, leaving the Proteas reeling at 19 for 4 and eventually dismissed in 20.4 overs.Only wicketkeeper Sinalo Jafta showed resistance with 22 off 36 balls, but she found no support at the other end. Nine South African batters were dismissed for single-digit scores as England’s bowlers exploited movement with the new ball.England’s chase was straightforward. Tammy Beaumont (21*) and Amy Jones (40*) adopted a cautious start before opening up, putting away the loose deliveries. They overhauled the target with 215 balls to spare, which is also the fourth-most balls remaining in a successful ODI chase for England Women.England skipper Nat Sciver-Brunt praised her side’s all-round performance, saying, “Yeah, massively pleased. It just seemed like everyone was really on it in the field. We had a few first-ball wickets as well, so yeah, it all clicked into action for us.” She also lauded Smith’s impact, adding, “She just stuck to her strengths… we knew she was a really good match-up to those two batters.”South African captain Laura Wolvaardt admitted her side fell short. “Not our best work with the bat, but in saying that, I don’t think we’ve become a bad batting unit overnight,” she said. “We probably didn’t expect that much swing… we probably could have played straighter lines.”This was England’s first-ever 10-wicket win over South Africa in ODIs, and their third such win in World Cups overall. They now hold a 7-2 World Cup record against the Proteas, showing the massive upper hand in the rivalry.With this emphatic result, England have announced themselves strongly in the tournament, while South Africa will look to regroup quickly for their next fixture against New Zealand on October 6.","England thrashed South Africa by 10 wickets in their Women's World Cup opener.

Poll Do you agree with Tuchel's decision to leave Bellingham out of the squad for upcoming matches? Yes, it’s the right choice. No, he should be included.

England manager Thomas Tuchel has explained that Jude Bellingham’s absence from the squad for upcoming matches against Wales and Latvia is due to the midfielder’s “lack of rhythm” and not any personal issues.Bellingham, 22, missed England’s September victories over Andorra and Serbia following shoulder surgery and has since featured in only four matches for Real Madrid, starting just once.“He’s a very special player and for special players there can be special rules, I get this,” Tuchel said, referring to Bellingham, who was named England men’s player of the year for 2024/25 at the start of the month. “But for this camp we decided that we stick with our straightforward decision to invite the same team. That applies also for Jude, he deserves always to be in camp.”Tuchel added that Bellingham had been eager to play. “He wanted to be called up, we had a phone call, there was no issue from that side,” he said.The manager also addressed concerns about any friction with other notable absentees, Jack Grealish and Phil Foden, stressing: “No, there is also no problem between me and Phil Foden, there is also no problem with Jack Grealish.Very special players. There is no problem at all, there is no personal problem.”Arsenal forward Bukayo Saka returns to the squad after missing September’s internationals with a hamstring issue, while Cole Palmer, Noni Madueke, and Tino Livramento are ruled out through injury.England currently sit atop their World Cup qualifying group, having beaten Andorra 2-0 and Serbia 5-0 last month to record five wins from five matches. Tuchel emphasised the decision to maintain continuity in the squad, saying, “We decided to invite the same group of players to make more stable what we built on.

A new chapter in football history is unfolding as Luca Zidane, son of French legend Zinedine Zidane , received his first call-up to the Algerian national team on Thursday. The 27-year-old goalkeeper, who previously represented France at youth levels, is now eligible to play for Algeria through his father’s family heritage, marking a significant “change of an era” in the Zidane legacy.FIFA officially approved Zidane’s switch in national allegiance just two weeks ago, clearing the way for him to represent the North African nation. Currently playing for Spanish second-division side Granada, Luca’s call-up comes at a critical juncture, with Algeria on the cusp of qualifying for the 2026 FIFA World Cup in North America.Algeria coach Vladimir Petkovic included Zidane in his 26-player squad for upcoming qualifying fixtures against Somalia on October 9 and Uganda on October 14. The Desert Foxes lead their group by four points, and a victory in either match would secure their spot in the tournament co-hosted by the United States, Canada, and Mexico.The Zidane name is already etched in World Cup history. Zinedine Zidane played in three editions for France, lifting the trophy in 1998 and experiencing heartbreak in 2006 after his infamous headbutt in the final against Italy. Now, Luca has the opportunity to make his mark on the international stage and continue his father’s storied legacy — this time with Algeria.With the 2026 World Cup approaching, Luca Zidane’s debut signals not just a personal milestone but a symbolic shift in football heritage.",Luca Zidane received his first call-up to the Algerian national team on Thursday.

Lamine Yamal returned from injury to help Barcelona beat Real Sociedad 2-1 on Sunday and move top of La Liga by one point.After Real Madrid were thrashed 5-2 by rivals Atletico Madrid in a derby on Saturday, Hansi Flick's side had the chance to claim pole position above Xabi Alonso's side.Alvaro Odriozola gave Real Sociedad the lead against the run of play in the first half but Jules Kounde headed the Spanish champions level.Yamal, who missed the last four games with a groin injury, created the winner for Robert Lewandowski just moments after coming on as a second-half substitute.""I'm very happy for (Yamal), very pleased that he's back on the pitch because we're going to need him,"" Kounde told Movistar.""He showed directly the outstanding strength he has to create chances, to give that last pass,"" said Flick.Barcelona held the game at the Olympic stadium, where they have played for the last two seasons, after the city council refused them a permit to reopen their Camp Nou home earlier in the week.Flick handed 17-year-old attacking midfielder Dro Fernandez his debut, also starting Roony Bardghji on the right wing and bringing in veteran Wojciech Szczesny for injured goalkeeper Joan Garcia.Barcelona dominated the ball in the first half but found it hard to beat Real Sociedad goalkeeper Alex Remiro.The Spain international made a fine save to deny Marcus Rashford in the early stages.On loan from Manchester United, Rashford is finding his footing at Barca and played a superb through ball for Lewandowski, who fired across the face of goal from a tight angle.Real Sociedad hit Barca with a sharp counter-attack to open the scoring after 31 minutes.Former Real Madrid defender Odriozola applied the finishing touch to Ander Barrenetxea's cross.Barcelona stepped up a gear and found the equaliser from a corner before the break.Rashford, who provided an assist from another corner against Real Oviedo in midweek, whipped it to the near post, where Kounde powered home a header.Flick replaced Dro with Dani Olmo at half-time and also brought on Yamal before the hour mark, after the teenager recovered from his groin issue.Voted the second best player in the world at the Ballon d'Or gala on Monday, Yamal made an instant impact.The 18-year-old burst into the box and crossed for Lewandowski to head home off the post, just over a minute after his introduction.""His presence on the pitch is a threat,"" said Real Sociedad coach Sergio Francisco.""Even putting on fresh players against him (doesn't work)... he's showing he's the best player in the world.""Szczesny made a good save from Oyarzabal as La Real gave Barcelona a couple of scares, while Remiro denied Rashford and Olmo with two more good saves.The game grew increasingly chaotic and both sides hit the crossbar in quick succession.Kounde, daydreaming in midfield, was robbed and Real Sociedad worked the ball to Takefusa Kubo, who crashed a shot against the woodwork.Then Barcelona broke away and Ferran Torres teed up Lewandowski, who battered the crossbar when well placed to put the game to bed, but the hosts were not punished.""It was a difficult game, I didn't like our last 25 minutes, we suffered too much,"" added Kounde.""The first 70 minutes I think were quite good, we could have scored more than two... but I didn't like how it ended.""Barcelona host Paris Saint-Germain in the Champions League on Wednesday, also at the Olympic stadium.Real Sociedad have had a tough start to the season, sitting 17th, but have been improving and will take heart from the pressure they put Barca under.""Despite the defeat I'm proud of the team's work,"" said Odriozola. ""It's been a tough start and today we showed up.""Earlier Sunday, promoted side Elche beat Celta Vigo 2-1 to climb up to fourth.Valencia's match on Monday at home against Real Oviedo is at risk of postponement because of expected heavy rain in the region. Last year flooding in the area killed over 200 people.",Lamine Yamal returns from injury to help Barcelona beat Real Sociedad 2-1.

What’s common between the three Formula E world champions

How the three World Champions fared in Formula E Season 11

Days after Oliver Rowland lifted his Formula E World Championship trophy in London this season, an interesting trend has come to the attention of Formula E and its fans. As a coincidence, all Formula E drivers who won the Mexico City E-Prix went on to win the Formula E World Championship that season, and this has been proved right for three consecutive years.Highlighting the same since 2023, a poster of three World Champions was shared on X by Formula E with the caption, “The trend continues. Each winner of the #MexicoCityEPrix from the past three seasons has gone on to become World Champion.”The special poster features 2023 Formula E World Champion Jake Dennis from Andretti, then TAG Heuer Porsche’s Pascal Wehrlein, who won in 2024, and the new World Champion, Nissan driver Oliver Rowland. All three of them won in the Mexico E-Prix and went on to lift the winner’s trophy in the Formula E World Championship that year.Oliver Rowland had strengthened his chances of winning the Formula E World Championship this year much earlier. He was leading the Formula E Driver Standings ever since he won Part 2 of the Jeddah E-Prix, which was his second win of the season after winning the Mexico E-Prix. In the last leg, the Nissan driver got nervous for a while as Pascal Wehrlein, who was following him in the number two position, closed the gap after grabbing quite a few podiums while Rowland had a dull period.Things became serious for Rowland when he failed to finish the Round 13 race in Berlin, while Wehrlein won second spot on the podium. But he eventually managed to confirm his championship in Berlin after four wins and three more podiums.Sharing about his bad race in Berlin, Rowland had said, “I was hoping before the weekend that the outcome could be [the World Championship], but after yesterday (Saturday) and this morning (Sunday), I was more worried that it might never come.”Also Read: Oliver Rowland reacts to daughter’s sweet radio message after Formula E Championship win: “It’s amazing” Things, however, changed for Wehrlein, who was pushed to third position after Nick Cassidy made a late entry in the Formula E Driver Standings by registering three consecutive wins.

Wehrlein registered one win and five more podiums this season.Meanwhile, Andretti driver Jake Dennis finished in seventh position in the Formula E Driver Standings.

Taylor Barnard on losing top three spot in Formula E World Championship

Fans hail Taylor Barnard for his fantastic rookie season

It was Taylor Barnard’s rookie season this year, and the NEOM McLaren driver put up a fantastic performance by temporarily making it to the top three in the Formula E Driver Standings by ousting the much more experienced Porsche driver Antonio Felix Da Costa. He was, however, ousted from the top three at the London E-Prix as Jaguar’s Nick Cassidy went on to register three consecutive wins. Barnard took to Instagram to share his feelings on losing out on the top three in his first-ever season and his claim to the championship.Taking to Instagram after the London E-Prix, Barnard wrote, “London wasn’t what we hoped for, easily being the toughest weekend of our season. Taking 0 points away as a team from a doubleheader hurts, but one weekend doesn’t define the year we’ve had.”He further wrote, “As the season closes, I want to say a massive thank you to the entire team, both trackside and behind the scenes, for everything this season. Finishing P4 in the Drivers’ Championship and coming into the final weekend with a shot at runner-up is something to be proud of.”Also adding a note for teammate Sam Bird, as NEOM McLaren withdrew from Formula E after the end of the season, Barnard wrote, “@sambird_official it wasn’t the weekend you deserved either.You’ve been a huge part of my season both on and off the track, and I’m grateful for everything. You deserved more. To all the Papaya fans, thank you for the incredible support in our final race together.

McLaren team principal Ian James pens open letter to fans

What’s next in Formula E?

Team Principal Ian James of the departing Formula E team NEOM McLaren has penned an open letter to the fans of the team, marking their departure from the electric motorsport format. Addressing the Papaya Army, James thanked them for their trust and support as the team went on to win two Drivers’ World Championships and two Teams’ World Championships over 103 races in seven seasons.Ian James began the letter saying that he wrote it with “a huge amount of pride, as well as with more than a hint of sadness,” as the team closed the final chapter after seven years of competing in the ABB FIA Formula E World Championship.Thanking the fans for their love on social media and at the track, he said, “The team was always blown away by the amount of papaya we saw at circuits across the world, race-in, race-out, right from our very first round as the NEOM McLaren Formula E team. Through the early days, the good days, the bad days, and the great days, we have always felt an overwhelming amount of support from you all.”For the partners associated with the team, he wrote, “They say that ‘racing is a state of mind’, and since its inception, this team has had the privilege of working for organisations, with partners, and racing for fans who fully embrace this philosophy.This is certainly true of those at McLaren, whose passion for racing is second to none.”“My heartfelt thanks go out to everyone who has been involved: those at McLaren who backed us, the fans who supported us, and the partners who allowed us to go racing. We couldn’t have done it without you all — your trust and support have never been taken for granted,” he added.Praising the two McLaren drivers, he wrote, “Sam clinched McLaren’s first-ever fully electric win at the São Paulo E-Prix in Season 10, pulling off one of Formula E’s all-time great overtakes, before being waved across the line by none other than Emerson Fittipaldi – McLaren's first Formula 1 World Champion. While Taylor has been a rookie sensation in Season 11, securing five Formula E records, including the youngest driver to start a race, the youngest points scorer, the youngest driver to lead a lap, the youngest podium finisher, and the youngest polesitter. ”He ended the letter saying, “Some of us have been together since the day we first launched this team, while others have seamlessly fitted in along the way and flourished within the environment we have cultivated.

How do Formula E and ABB work together?

What do ABB and Formula E say about the partnership?

After a successful Season 11, ABB and Formula E have announced that they will continue their partnership in the upcoming season. This gives ABB another opportunity to promote its new brand positioning via the ABB FIA Formula E World Championship, along with technologies that help industries take a cleaner route.Over a period of eight seasons, the partnership with Formula E has provided ABB a platform to showcase how technology can help industries outrun challenges, engage with customers around the world, and implement its own solutions into the series to improve reliability and efficiency. The partnership extension will provide a year-round opportunity for brand-building and activation, communicating ABB and its technology solutions to new global audiences, including Formula E’s international fanbase.ABB and Formula E will also join hands to engage a new generation of fans, collaborating with unexpected influencers and content creators to tell compelling stories that make advanced electrification and automation technologies tangible and exciting.The end of the mid-race car swap, a 150kW increase in power, top speeds that are 43 percent higher, and energy recovery increasing from 15 to 50 percent indicate how far Formula E technology has come to outperform on track.ABB has also built on its technical involvement in the series, supplying the race chargers from Season 9, and introducing its ABB Ability OPTIMAX® energy management software (Season 9) and Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) technology (Season 5) to the sport.ABB Head of Brand Paco Liebrand said, “We are pleased to be continuing our partnership with Formula E which, like ABB, is striving for a leaner and cleaner future. The synergy between the two organizations, combined with the global appeal of the Championship, makes it a great platform to promote our brand positioning.”He further said, “Formula E is increasingly working with content creators, influencers, and celebrities, with initiatives such as the Evo Sessions making an impact through digital channels beyond the racing itself, which is also an essential part of ABB’s new brand strategy. Going forward, we will be enhancing the way we harness the benefits of this collaboration, ensuring the focus is on delivering content and activations that reinforce our new messaging, build familiarity, and tell the ‘Engineered to Outrun’ story. ”Formula E Chief Revenue Officer Tiziana Di Gioia said, “Our renewed partnership with ABB is a testament to the commercial power and benefit of Formula E as a global platform that drives both brand and business growth. ABB, like our wider partnership portfolio, has and continues to see enormous value in collaborating with the fastest-growing motorsport on the planet, with viewership, commercial integration, and brand storytelling continuing to accelerate. Over eight seasons, ABB has moved from brand visibility to brand activation—integrating deeply into the fan experience, the sport’s ecosystem, and our innovation narrative.Also Read: Antonio Felix Da Costa shares happy memories as Porsche wins Formula E Teams and Manufacturers’ World Championships “This next chapter elevates the partnership even further. With ABB’s new positioning, we are co-creating opportunities across content, digital storytelling, and market engagement, transforming a title partnership into a year-round, value-generating relationship. It’s a model of how modern sponsorships should evolve, rooted in purpose and cultural alignment but measured by impact,” she added.Formula E Season 12 will begin with testing in Valencia in October.","ABB and Formula E have announced that they will continue their partnership in the upcoming season.

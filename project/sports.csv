Gautam Gambhir press conference: On Kohli, Rohit and dressing room

SYDNEY: The regular captain who sat out, and the stand-in who hobbled away. Nothing went right for India at the SCG and their campaign was mired in disappointment from start to finish.The biggest blow of all was the sight of Jasprit Bumrah walking out of the ground due to back spasms on Day Two. He would play no further role with ball in hand, neutering India's capabilities and sparking a quick defeat.This has been the Jasprit Bumrah Series, bookended by ecstasy in Perth and agony here at the SCG. Throughout, the side's complete dependence on him has sparked concern. The signs were there right from the second Test in Adelaide, when he experienced some groin discomfort and cramps. The incessant rain in Brisbane then allowed some breathing space before the immense workload at the MCG, where he bowled 53.2 overs, eventually led to breakdown.""It's a little frustrating, but sometimes you've got to respect your body. You can't fight your body,"" Bumrah told the official broadcaster after the day's play. ""It's a little disappointing in the end because I probably missed out on the spiciest wicket of the series. That's the way it is. Sometimes you've to accept it and move forward.""Bumrah bowled a back-breaking 151.2 overs across the five Tests, an immense burden for a bowler with an unorthodox action off a short run up. In Bumrah's absence, Prasidh Krishna and Mohammed Siraj proved woefully inadequate in defending India's 162-run target on Sunday, even on the helpful SCG pitch. Head coach Gautam Gambhir , however, praised Siraj's attitude after the day's play.""Bumrah did everything possible,"" Gambhir said. ""He led the attack really well. He bowled a lot of overs. He took wickets. But there's been help from the other end as well. From Bumrah's point of view, he had a phenomenal series, (but) he was helped by Mohammed Siraj, Akash Deep, Harshit Rana in the first two Tests.""Bumrah himself said the younger lot would emerge from the tour better equipped to handle pressure. ""It was a well-fought series, (there are) a lot of learnings for us. A lot of ifs and buts but it was not like it was totally one-sided,"" he said.""Being in the game for longer, creating pressure, absorbing pressure, playing to the situation, all these learnings are important. Young players come up having success in a certain way, but in Test cricket you've to adapt, make your game work in a different manner. These learnings will help us in the future.""The talk on Bumrah's leadership capabilities will no doubt gain pace ahead of the England series in five months' time. For now, it's time to let his wondrous wicket-taking capabilities sink in.""It's the best individual performance I've seen in Test cricket,"" Australia's Travis Head gushed. ""Bumrah is a great performer.""",Jasprit Bumrah bowled a back-breaking 151.2 overs across the five Tests. Prasidh Krishna and Mohammed Siraj proved woefully inadequate in defending India's 162-run target.

'Kohli, Rohit future up to them'

'Need to be fair to everyone'

'Not the results we've been expecting'

'Give importance to domestic cricket'

SYDNEY: The SCG pitch finds itself in the eye of a storm after a recent relay altered its usually benign nature, but it has a fan in India's head coach Gautam Gambhir , who feels such surfaces are important since they challenge batters, bring the bowlers into play and induce results.""It's been some really nice wickets (overall in the series),"" Gambhir said, ""It's good for Test cricket. There was enough for the bowlers, enough for batters as well. This is how Test cricket needs to be played, (on) result-oriented wickets. We talk a lot about turning pitches back home. This was as spicy as what we get back home,"" Gambhir said.Gambhir's stance was in stark contrast to that of former captain Sunil Gavaskar , who said the conditions were ""not ideal"". ""When I saw the pitch, I did say the cows could have gone and grazed on it,"" Gavaskar said on ABC Radio. ""This is not the pitch you want because you want it to go to the fourth or fifth day. Former players who've played here were so surprised. If 15 wickets fell a day in India, there would be hell.""Gambhir, however, said, ""Everything boils down to the temperament, how much you want to play out those tough moments. Test cricket is all about playing out the sessions, seeing off a (good) spell. That's one issue we need to look at, how we can convert those 40s into big hundreds and set the game for our bowlers.""Asked about the roadmap for Tests ahead of the England series in July and the fate of struggling senior batters like Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli , Gambhir said, ""I can't talk about the future of any player. It's up to them as well. They still have the hunger and passion. Hopefully they can continue to take Indian cricket forward. But ultimately, we all know, whatever they plan, they'll plan in the best interests of Indian cricket. It's about whether the team is moving forward with your contribution, or not. There are very honest players in that dressing room.""Gambhir refused to clarify if the England tour would see wholesale changes in the squad. ""It's not the right time. A lot of things change in sport. Form, people, attitude, everything changes. Five months is a long time,"" he said.On a related note, Gambhir also said he would not be doing justice to his role as head coach if he favoured certain reputations over others. ""My biggest responsibility is that I have to be fair to everyone in the room. If I'm fair to only two or three individuals, I'm being dishonest in my job. Whether a player hasn't made his debut yet, or whether he has played 100 Tests, I have to be equal to everyone.""Gambhir has had a rocky start to his international coaching career, with India having lost six out of 10 Tests under him, including the 0-3 series whitewash at home to New Zealand and now the three defeats in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy here.""It's been tough and obviously not the results we've been expecting,"" he said, ""All I can expect from that dressing room is to keep fighting, stay honest, but ultimately it's a result-oriented sport.""Gambhir also welcomed suggestions that India's Test batters should play on the domestic first-class circuit, saying, ""I'd like everyone to play domestic cricket. If you don't give importance to domestic cricket, you'll never get the desired players at the Test level.""","Gautam Gambhir says SCG pitch is good for Test cricket.

Why R Ashwin retirement was a last minute surprise for Ravindra Jadeja

LIVE from Sydney: Gautam Gambhir’s explosive remarks after SCG defeat, plans for seniors, team plan

Sydney: When the defeat was in plain sight, India's stand-in captain walked out of the dressing room during the team's bowling for the final time in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy . He took the seat next to regular captain Rohit Sharma and both helplessly sat as Australia went past the finish line.The look on Bumrah's face said it all.The bowler who gave his all in the first four Tests, and the first innings at the Sydney Cricket Ground, wasn't able to have one final go at the Australians as a back spasm kept him away. There were 50-50 chances, and they increased the moment he came out to bat, but it still wasn't enough to have him doing what he has done in the entire series - torment the batters. He had the whites on, elbows rested on the knees and he stooped a bit forward to watch the last few overs of the Australian run-chase.Not many were on the board to defend and it was always going to be difficult to make a contest with just two proper bowlers and three fillers. The four wickets did make it a bit interesting and injected some life into the changing room but it was short-lived as perennial tormentor Travis Head, along with debutant Beau Webster, overhauled the target in just 27 overs.The celebrations in the opposite camp began as Bumrah descended the stairs for the customary handshakes. Right behind him was regular captain Rohit, still in his training gear, as the visitors dragged themselves off the field after a long tour Down Under.A series which started with the high in Perth ended with a lot of disappointment in Sydney. India, under Bumrah and Rohit and even Virat, had their little moments but it was Australia's regular capitalisation of the crucial junctures which helped them end the decade-long wait for the Border-Gavaskar Trophy.The five-Test series challenged both sets of players, physically and mentally, and India saw the exit of one of their greatest match winners in R Ashwin. Rohit, too, didn't feature in the final Test as questions were continuously raised on the future of ageing superstars in that dressing room, which doesn't look happy anymore.And why would it. Coach Gautam Gambhir had said a few months back that a winning dressing room is a happy dressing room but that hasn't been the case in the last eight Tests. They have won just one, yes just one fixture, and were saved by rain in Brisbane. The head coach admitted it's been tough but lauded the entire bunch for the fight they put in the last two months.""Yeah, it's been tough. Absolutely no doubt about it. It's been really tough and obviously these weren't the results we were expecting in the last eight Test matches but that is what sport is all about. All I can expect from that dressing room is to keep fighting and all we all can do is to be honest and keep fighting and keep doing the right things. What is good for Indian cricket is as simple as it can get but more importantly it's a result oriented sport and we all play for results and it hasn't gone our way as simple as it can be,"" says Gambhir.While there are plenty of questions left to be answered, there are some important ones on the future of both Rohit and Kohli. Gambhir, for now, didn't have an answer to that and emphasised that it's up to the players also.""See I can't talk about the future of any player, it's up to them as well. But yes, what I can say is that they still have the hunger, they still have the passion, they're tough people and hopefully they can continue to take Indian cricket forward but ultimately as we all know that whatever they plan, they will plan for the best interest of Indian cricket,"" said Gambhir.There's still time before India play their next Test, against England in England in June, but for now the coach needs to ensure that the dressing room remains a happy dressing room for the road ahead.""Happiness will always be intact. Because the reason is that all we can do is try and prepare to the best of our ability, try and be 100% committed on the field, not only on that particular day, every session, every hour, every ball. If you're committed to what we are doing with honesty, I think that should be fine.""I have to be absolutely honest and equal and fair to everyone in that dressing room. I know we haven't got the results and it is frustrating. I'm not saying it's not frustrating. It is challenging. But whatever we can do with the best interest of Indian cricket, that will continue to happen in the dressing room,"" explained Gambhir.It wasn't a happy sight to see the dropping shoulders towards the closing moments of the game and Gambhir has his task cut out that the side returns to winning, and remains on happy ways.","India's stand-in captain walked out of the dressing room during the team's bowling for the final time in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy.

IND vs AUS: Rishabh Pant on dropped Rohit Sharma, criticism, Jasprit Bumrah

NEW DELHI: If the opening day of the fifth Test at the Sydney Cricket Ground was dramatic, Day 2 brought even more high-octane action. After bowling out India for a modest 185 on a grassy SCG pitch, Australia found themselves in trouble at the start of their first innings. Jasprit Bumrah , who dismissed Usman Khawaja late on Day 1, struck again early on Day 2 by removing Marnus Labuschagne. Mohammed Siraj then took center stage, producing a game-changing over that left Australia reeling.Siraj’s first breakthrough came with a superb outswinger to Sam Konstas, who drove with hard hands and edged it to Yashasvi Jaiswal at gully, where a stunning catch was taken.Siraj followed it up with another outswinger, this time slightly shorter, which induced a thick edge from Travis Head. The ball flew to KL Rahul at second slip, who made no mistake.Siraj was visibly pumped after his two-wicket burst, with Virat Kohli joining the celebrations in trademark fashion—jumping and pumping his fists with enthusiasm.Kohli then turned to the crowd, waving his arms to fire them up, adding to the electrifying atmosphere at the SCG.Australia, leading 2-1, need a win or a draw to reclaim the Border-Gavaskar Trophy after a decade. India, on the other hand, must win to level the series 2-2 and retain the trophy as the holders.India previously registered consecutive series wins in Australia, under Virat Kohli in 2018/19 and Ajinkya Rahane in 2020/21.",Mohammed Siraj takes two wickets on Day 2 of fifth Test at SCG.

Gautam Gambhir on India XI for SCG Test, dressing room unity and more

Another controversy erupted early on the first morning of the fifth Test between India and Australia in Sydney when a relay catch involving Steve Smith and Marnus Labuschagne off Virat Kohli 's bat was ruled by the third umpire as not legitimate.With Indian openers KL Rahul (4) and Yashasvi Jaiswal (10) dismissed early, India were 17 for 2 when Kohli came in to bat and edged the first ball he faced from Scott Boland to the slips, where the Aussie players claimed the relay catch between Smith and Labuschagne.Diving low to his right, Smith believed to have got his fingers underneath the ball before lobbing it in the air for Labuschagne to complete the catch. The decision was referred by the on-field umpires for review, and the third umpire ruled that the ball grazed the ground before Smith lobbed it back up.Talking to Fox Cricket at the lunch break, Smith said he has no doubt that it was a clean catch, but they have to accept the decision taken by the match officials.""Did you get your hand underneath that ball?"" former England player turned commentator Isa Guha asked Smith?""100%, no denying it whatsoever. But the umpires made the decision, and we move on,"" replied Smith.After replays were shown on the giant screen and the third umpire announced his view, Kohli was seen shaking his head with a wry smile on his face.India went to lunch at a shaky 57 for 3, losing Shubman Gill (20) off the last ball delivered by off-spinner Nathan Lyon before the break, leaving Kohli on the crease at 20 not out. He was joined by Rishabh Pant post lunch.Earlier, India left captain Rohit Sharma out of the eleven, with Jasprit Bumrah doing the leadership duty and chose to bat first after winning the toss.India made two changes to their team. Shubman Gill took Rohit's place, while Prasidh Krishna came in for fellow pacer Akash Deep who is out with a back injury.","Third umpire rules Steve Smith and Marnus Labuschagne's relay catch off Virat Kohli not legitimate.

Afghanistan's leg-spinner Rashid Khan 's remarkable six-wicket haul has placed his team on the cusp of victory against Zimbabwe in the decisive second Test match in Bulawayo.At the end of the fourth day, Zimbabwe found themselves struggling at 205 for 8 in their second innings, still needing 73 runs to reach their target. The match has seen fluctuating fortunes for both sides.Rashid Khan, who had already taken four wickets for 94 runs in the first innings, ended the day with impressive figures of 6 for 66 in the second innings.A prominent figure in T20 cricket, Rashid, playing in only his sixth Test match, achieved his fifth five-wicket haul and his third ten-wicket match haul.Ismat Alam, making his Test debut, scored a century (101 runs), propelling Afghanistan to a total of 363 all out in their second innings, and setting Zimbabwe a target of 276 runs. Sikandar Raza and Zimbabwe's captain, Craig Ervine , formed a 58-run partnership for the fifth wicket, bringing the score to 157 for 5 before Rashid delivered a significant blow to the home team.Raza attempted to hit a short delivery from Rashid Khan, but Shahidullah Kamal took an easy catch at silly mid-off, dismissing Raza for 38 runs off 83 balls.Rashid had previously dismissed Dion Myers for 6 runs. After Raza's dismissal, he proceeded to bowl Sean Williams for 16 runs and Brian Bennett for a duck in quick succession.Williams, hampered by a back injury, mistimed a sweep shot, while Bennett was clean bowled by a delivery that pitched on middle stump and straightened, passing the edge of the bat.Zimbabwe's hopes of victory now rest largely on 39-year-old Craig Ervine, who remained unbeaten on 53 at the close of play.

NEW DELHI: Shan Masood and Babar Azam built a record opening partnership after conceding a 421-run first innings deficit as Pakistan fought back on day three of the second Test at Newlands.At the close of play, Pakistan were 213 for one in their follow-on innings. The visitors still need 208 runs to put South African to bat again.Pakistan captain Masood remained unbeaten on 102, his sixth Test century. Babar contributed 81 runs, his third consecutive half-century of the series.Babar's last international century came in August 2023. He missed out again on Sunday, caught in the gully off Marco Jansen's bowling shortly before stumps.The Masood-Babar partnership of 205 runs was Pakistan's highest opening stand against South Africa in Tests. It also surpassed Pakistan's first innings total of 194, which prompted the follow-on from South African captain Temba Bavuma.This was Babar's second notable partnership of the day.He opened the batting f Pakistan after Saim Ayub's injury. Ayub fractured his right ankle and was ruled out of the match.Babar scored 58 in the first innings. He and Mohammad Rizwan (46) added 98 runs for the fourth wicket. Babar's dismissal triggered a Pakistan collapse.Babar and Rizwan, resuming at 64 for three overnight, batted comfortably through the first hour. They effectively neutralized the threat posed by South Africa's main strike bowlers, Kagiso Rabada and Jansen.Debutant Kwena Maphaka, 18, broke the partnership five balls after the morning drinks break. Babar glanced a loose delivery down the leg side and was caught behind by Kyle Verreynne.Babar appeared stunned by his dismissal after a solid 127-ball innings.Five overs later, Rizwan charged down the pitch to Wiaan Mulder and edged a wild slog onto his stumps.The remaining Pakistani batsmen offered little resistance.Masood and Babar demonstrated in the second innings that the pitch, where South Africa amassed 615 runs, offered no significant challenges.Their positive stroke play, combined with quick running between the wickets, kept the scoreboard ticking. They rarely appeared troubled.South Africa's frustration was evident when Mulder threw the ball at Babar, then on 56, after a firmly struck shot back towards the bowler.The incident sparked an exchange of words involving wicketkeeper Verreynne and required intervention from the umpires.Masood, a left-hander, reached his century off 159 balls, hitting 14 fours in the process.","Shan Masood and Babar Azam build a record opening partnership after conceding a 421-run first innings deficit.

The remaining seven knocks added a meager 54 runs.This stark inconsistency has been symptomatic of his overall Test decline since 2020, during which he has averaged just 30.72 across 39 matches.Rohit Sharma, too, has faced criticism after a disappointing series where he averaged just 10.33 across three matches.While his numbers since 2021 (2,160 runs at 34.28) slightly edge out Kohli’s, the steep drop in his 2024 form—619 runs at 24.76—has intensified calls for him to step aside.Rohit’s clarification that he has no plans to retire has not quelled debates about his role in the side and whether it’s time for a generational transition.As players like R Ashwin have chosen a graceful exit during the series, fans now wonder if Rohit and Kohli will follow suit or rediscover the form that once defined their greatness.The decision, as Manjrekar rightly says, now lies in the selectors' hands.",Former Indian cricketer Sanjay Manjrekar summed up a key aspect of cricketing careers on X.

NEW DELHI: In a dramatic 2-2 draw at Anfield on Sunday, Manchester United came back to end a four-game losing streak and stop Liverpool's run at the Premier League title.With one game remaining, Liverpool leads second-place Arsenal by six points at the top of the league.However, Arne Slot's team lost this chance after rallying from behind to take a 2-1 lead thanks to goals from Cody Gakpo and Mohamed Salah Amad Diallo tied the score on the 80th minute to give United the point they so richly deserved after breaking their six-year goal drought at Anfield with a superb opening strike from Lisandro Martinez.The Red Devils are now seven points above the relegation zone and in 13th place in the standings.Prior to the match, Liverpool manager Slot warned that United was ""much better"" than their startling league place indicated, and it turned out to be true.In Monday's dreadful 2-0 loss to Newcastle, United was sliced open at will, prompting manager Ruben Amorim to declare the team in a relegation fight.The return of Manuel Ugarte and captain Bruno Fernandes from suspension, as well as Kobbie Mainoo to the starting lineup, strengthened Amorim's hand.Although the Portuguese's strategy of frustrating Liverpool was successful, the home team did have early opportunities to break through.Gakpo poked past the far post after a through pass from Ryan Gravenberch.Shortly after, Salah found Alexis Mac Allister with a sumptuous pass that the Argentine snatched up and caused Andre Onana to make a wonderful physical save.United should have been ahead before halftime, but it took some time for them to establish themselves as an attacking danger.With the goal gaping from Diogo Dalot's cross, Diallo made a mistake with his header.After racing in behind the Liverpool defense, Rasmus Hojlund had the finest opportunity of the first half, but he was unable to defeat Alisson Becker.However, United players who had been dejected in recent weeks were suddenly regaining their confidence.The visitors' breakthrough came from an unexpected source as Martinez scored his second goal for the team with a blazing hit that landed off the underside of the bar, teaching his strikers how to finish.The league leaders were momentarily in disarray, and the Anfield crowd was starting to grow restless.But Liverpool's breadth of weaponry is largely responsible for their top-of-the-table standing.They had a forward who was in form to come up with the magic moment needed to change the game, even on a quiet day for Salah.At the hour, Gakpo scored his 10th goal in 15 games by turning inside his Dutch international teammate Matthijs de Ligt and blasting high beyond Onana.Slot made two forward substitutions right away after the equalizer, introducing Darwin Nunez and Diogo Jota, and he was rewarded for it.With a VAR review, a spot-kick was awarded when MacAllister's header brushed off De Ligt's outstretched arm within the penalty area.Salah scored his 18th Premier League goal in 19 games with a low, powerful smash past Onana.But United's strong performance earned the point it deserved, ending Amorim's worrying losing run so early in his tenure.Alejandro Garnacho's new manager has questioned his temperament, but the Argentine came off the bench to equalize when Diallo turned in his low cross.And with the goal gaping deep into stoppage time, Harry Maguire should have made it even better for United by spooning a pass from Joshua Zirkzee over the bar.",Manchester United came back from 2-1 down to draw 2-2 with Liverpool.

City turned corner?

Arsenal blew a chance to make up significant ground on Premier League leaders Liverpool on Saturday with a frustrating draw at Brighton as Manchester City pummelled West Ham 4-1.In-form Newcastle inflicted another painful defeat on Ange Postecoglou's struggling Tottenham and Chelsea's recent woes continued with a 1-1 draw at Crystal Palace.Mikel Arteta's Arsenal, Premier League runners-up over the past two seasons, travelled to the south coast hunting a fourth straight league win in the evening kick-off.Seventeen-year-old Ethan Nwaneri, in for the injured Bukayo Saka, scored a first-half goal to put them on course for a vital three points.But after being felled by an accidental headbutt from William Saliba, stand-in Seagulls captain Joao Pedro fired home from the spot in the 61st minute.The 1-1 draw means the second-placed Gunners are five points behind Liverpool, having played two games more, with Arne Slot's in-form leaders hosting crisis-hit Manchester United on Sunday.Arteta said his team had under-performed in the second half, failing to build momentum, adding that the penalty award was ""bizarre"".""We are really disappointed with the decision that leads to the goal because I have never seen something like this in my life,"" the Spaniard told the BBC.""He (Saliba) touches the ball as well.""Manchester City's win at home against West Ham means they have now won successive matches for the first time since October and Pep Guardiola will hope they are back on track after a horror run of one victory in 13 games in all competitions.The defending champions took an early lead through a Vladimir Coufal own goal and two goals from Erling Haaland put City in total command.Phil Foden made it 4-0 before Niclas Fullkrug grabbed a consolation for Julen Lopetegui's men, who suffered a 5-0 mauling by Liverpool last week.Despite their shocking run, sixth-placed City are just two points behind Chelsea, in fourth, but Guardiola said his team were still not back in the groove.""I'm very pleased for the result but you cannot ask me if the old City is back,"" he said. ""If you saw the game, we are not.""You saw many times during the years what we have done with the opponents.""In the early kick-off, Newcastle came from behind to clinch a fifth straight Premier League win and heap more misery on injury-hit Spurs.The home side went ahead in the fourth minute through Dominic Solanke.Newcastle levelled two minutes later when Anthony Gordon arrowed an effort into the bottom corner, but Postecoglou stood in disbelief on the touchline looking at referee Andrew Madley after Joelinton intercepted Lucas Bergvall's pass with his hand in the build-up.VAR deemed Joelinton's arm to be in a natural position and the contact to be accidental.In-form Alexander Isak scored what turned out to be the winner towards the end of the first period.The 2-1 victory, watched by new England manager Thomas Tuchel, leaves Newcastle in fifth spot, which may yet prove enough to secure a place in the Champions League next season.But Spurs have slumped to 12th in the table after five defeats in seven matches.Postecoglou said he was proud of his players but was the ""angriest I think I have ever been in my career"".""I think it's clear,"" said the Australian. ""Now whether people agree with me or not whether it wasn't handball or it was accidental, I'm just not interested in any of that discussion.""I know what everyone wants me to say, but all I'll say is that on any other day, on a fair and even playing ground, we would have won that game.

NEW DELHI: Barcelona's attempts to register Dani Olmo and Pau Victor for the remainder of the season have faced significant hurdles, leading to a potential departure of the players.The club took their case to Spain's High Council for Sports on Saturday after La Liga and the Spanish football federation (RFEF) denied their registration requests.The issue stems from Barcelona's financial and administrative constraints, which initially prevented the registration of Olmo and Victor beyond 2024.Despite registering Olmo last summer by utilising an injury exemption, the club lost two court cases seeking an extension of their registrations until the end of the season.In an effort to resolve the situation, Barcelona reportedly sold VIP seats at the future Camp Nou to generate funds and increase their budget, allowing for the players' registrations.However, the joint commission handling the applications denied the licenses due to RFEF rules prohibiting the registration of a player whose license has been previously cancelled within the same season.Barcelona have stated their intention to appeal the decision at the High Council for Sports. Club presidentJoan Laporta has faced criticism for his handling of the affair and has spoken with Olmo and Victor to reassure them.Notably, Olmo's contract reportedly includes a clause allowing him to leave if he cannot be registered.The absence of Olmo and Victor from Barcelona's squad for the Copa del Rey tie against Barbastro highlights the uncertainty surrounding their futures at the club.The situation stresses the complex financial and administrative challenges Barcelona are navigating as they seek to retain their star players while adhering to the regulations set forth by La Liga and the RFEF.",Barcelona's attempts to register Dani Olmo and Pau Victor for the remainder of the season have faced significant hurdles.

Newcastle defeated a depleted Tottenham side 2-1 on Saturday, with Alexander Isak continuing his Premier League scoring streak.The match witnessed early goals from both teams.

Barcelona 's head coach Hansi Flick expressed his discontent on Friday regarding the potential departure of crucial midfielder Dani Olmo due to the club's financial difficulties, while remaining hopeful for a positive resolution.On Tuesday, the Catalan club announced their request to the Spanish football federation for a new playing licence for Spanish international Olmo, following the expiration of his initial registration on December 31, 2024, after Barcelona had exhausted all legal options for extension.Barcelona acquired Olmo for approximately 60 million euros ($62 million) last summer. Spanish media reports suggest his contract contains a provision allowing his release if registration requirements are not met.Due to La Liga 's strict financial regulations limiting Barcelona's expenditure, the debt-laden club initially managed to register Olmo only after Andreas Christensen's injury in August.Striker Pau Victor faces a similar registration predicament.""If I am honest, I was not happy about the situation, and the players are not happy about the situation,"" Flick told a news conference Friday.""But it is like it is and we have to accept it, we are professional, we have to play football. I have to coach and the club has to do their job.""The confidence (in the club) is there, I am always positive about things, but we have to wait for the decision.""Barcelona are set to face Barbastro in the Copa del Rey round of 32 on Saturday, currently without Olmo and Victor.""My job is to prepare the team for the cup,"" continued Flick.""I was in contact before Christmas with the president and I spoke today with the president.""I have the confidence with the club that they do their job and I do my job.""Olmo, 26, a key contributor to Spain's Euro 2024 triumph, has shown excellent form since arriving from Leipzig, scoring five league goals.La Liga stated on Tuesday that ""Barcelona has presented no alternative"" that complies with league spending regulations to enable player registration.The potential loss of Olmo would significantly impact the third-placed Blaugrana's trophy aspirations this season, whilst adding to the club's series of administrative difficulties following years of financial mismanagement.","Hansi Flick expresses his discontent over Barcelona's potential departure of Dani Olmo.

Arteta stressed on Friday the importance of maintaining consistency as his team prepares for their Saturday fixture against Brighton.""We have to show the same level of consistency and a bit more, because the last year we have been the best team in the league, broken various records and still haven't won a major trophy, so something is missing,"" said the Spaniard.""It's going to be very thin, small details, you can pick up certain games and situations. But at the end, we're so close and we just have to flip that coin to the other side to make it happen. That's only going to happen if we do what we have to do and what we can control. The rest is out of our hands.""In their quest for their first Premier League title since 2004, Arsenal face a setback with Bukayo Saka 's hamstring injury, sidelining him until March following the Crystal Palace match.Regarding player rotation, Arteta stated: ""There's not one player that's going to play nine games in a row in that position, it's impossible.""He further noted: ""We need more threat, we need more players fit and rotation in that unit. In relation to that, we will make decisions and as well, players' performances, that's simple.""Regarding potential January transfers, Arteta remained noncommittal.""The focus is on the players that we have,"" he said. ""When something is in the market that we can afford and believe is going to have a real impact on the team, we have to be open to that possibility. We have the ability to change the squad in the windows, but at the moment the focus is on what we have.""",Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta stresses importance of consistency.

NEW DELHI: Novak Djokovic 's Australian Open preparations encountered a setback on Friday after he was eliminated from the Brisbane International by American Reilly Opelka .Opelka, standing at 2.11 meters (six feet 11 inches) tall, delivered a commanding performance. His exceptional serving and returns stunned the 24-time Grand Slam champion, resulting in a 7-6 (8/6), 6-3 victory.Djokovic, 37, had entered the tournament asserting his ability to challenge younger players.However, the 27-year-old Opelka, a former world number 17, dominated the match. He secured a comfortable win in one hour and 40 minutes.Opelka had been sidelined for almost two years, from 2022-24, due to hip and wrist surgeries.Opelka returned to professional tennis in July of last year. His performance against Djokovic demonstrated that his serve remains a potent weapon.He fired 16 aces and faced only one break point during the entire match.""He's the greatest player ever,"" Opelka said of Djokovic.""The reality is we have nothing to lose coming in against him. You end up playing more freely and you take a lot more risks because it's your only chance of beating him.""It's tough for him, because you get guys like me who are going to roll the dice, and on a day like this things go my way, and that's how it worked out.""Opelka advanced to the semi-finals, where he will face another formidable server, Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard. The rising French star hit an impressive 75 aces in three matches en route to his victory over Jakub Mensik, 7-5, 7-6 (7/5).The second men's semi-final will feature defending champion and second seed Grigor Dimitrov against Jiri Lehecka.In the women's draw, world number one Aryna Sabalenka advanced to the semi-finals with a straight-sets victory over Marie Bouzkova.Sabalenka, a two-time Australian Open champion, defeated Bouzkova 6-3, 6-4 in a challenging match lasting one hour and 45 minutes.Sabalenka will face Russian teenager Mirra Andreeva in the semi-finals.

She defeated former world number two Jabeur in a high-quality match.Jabeur, a Wimbledon finalist in 2022 and 2023, had been out of action since August due to a shoulder injury.Andreeva effectively countered Jabeur's varied shotmaking. She broke Jabeur once in the first set and rallied from two breaks down in the second set to force a tiebreak.Andreeva dominated the tiebreak, securing the victory in 90 minutes.""It was mentally hard to keep pushing and playing aggressively because we all know that she's very good at playing games -- drop shots, slices,"" Andreeva said.The other women's semi-final will be contested between Russian qualifier Polina Kudermetova and Ukrainian Anhelina Kalinina.The Australian Open is scheduled to commence on January 12.","Novak Djokovic knocked out of Brisbane International by Reilly Opelka.

Haryana shuttlers make a statement,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/badminton/haryana-shuttlers-make-a-statement/articleshow/116668736.cms,"BENGALURU: Haryana has always been India's mine for medals in sport. While they have excelled in sport like hockey, wrestling and boxing, women shuttlers from the state are now making a mark.A case to point is the recently concluded Senior Nationals badminton championships. Haryana won their maiden team title while Devika Sihag clinched the women's crown. Devika's triumph on Tuesday meant a hat-trick of singles titles for Haryana. Anmol Kharb and Anupama Upadhyay, representing Haryana, clinched the last two national titles, showcasing dominance in the women's competition. Besides, the talented 17-year-old Unnati Hooda is also from the state. Anmol made news earlier in the year, helping India win gold in the Badminton Asia Team Championships in Malaysia.""There are ranking tournaments in North now. Earlier, most of them were in Bengaluru and Hyderabad. We even have plenty of players in the U-11 category. The results we have been getting in the last three years has helped in the growth. Also, parents have realised that there is a future in badminton,"" said Harender Singh Malik, a coach at the Malik Badminton Academy in Sonipat, who added that five players from Haryana's winning team were from the academy.The emergence of several private academies has helped in popularising the sport. ""Earlier, there were just government centres with a huge number of kids. But private centres are smaller and more focused,"" said Malik.With the Haryana youngsters impressing at various levels, their progress will be closely monitored. The likes of Anmol, 17, and Unnati amongst others will be in focus as India look to carry on the legacy of Saina Nehwal and PV Sindhu ""If these girls can continue with the kind of passion they have now, they can be the next Sindhu and Saina (Nehwal). They have a chance, but they need to work hard and be more dedicated,"" said Haryana coach Ravikant Singla.It is common for young talent to fizzle out after age-group competitions. Some might fail to take their game to the next level, while others go after jobs for financial security. ""These kids are transitioning from juniors to seniors. A lot depends on how they adapt to injuries, superior quality (competitions and players). The next two years are important,"" said Malik.",Haryana has always been India's mine for medals in sport.

Head coach feels lucrative prize money & better scheduling could draw top stars

BENGALURU: Over the past five years, the number of Indian star shuttlers featuring in the individual events at the Senior national badminton championship has dwindled sharply. The ongoing competition at the Karnataka Badminton Association (KBA) here is no different. Of the six Indian men ranked inside the top 50 in the BWF rankings, only Satish Kumar Karunakaran, ranked 45, is competing, while Anupama Upadhyaya (ranked 46) and Aakarshi Kashyap (47) are the top-ranked women players in fray.As a result, Badminton Association of India (BAI) secretary general Sanjay Mishra recently said the federation in future could make the premier domestic event mandatory.India head coach Pullela Gopichand remarked, ""It’s always a challenge when you want (top) athletes to play two circuits, international and national, or national and state. Ideally, there should be only one calendar,"" he said here Sunday.""…the importance of the national championship has gone down. How do we revive it?"" he questioned.Scheduling is one of the key reasons for top players not featuring in the nationals. With the competition played at the year’s end, it is internationally offseason and an ideal resting period for the players. It is also the phase during which many of them begin preparations for the next season, which starts in early January.With star players focusing on major international events, which offer bigger prize money and ranking points, how can a player be convinced to play in the nationals?""You must give them benefits. Making it mandatory is one way, but they could just come, walk the first day, lose a match and walk off. That’s not the purpose. So, you want them to come here prepared and perform. So, either the prize money needs to be at a point where it is motivating or certain things such as an honour or a facility should be there,"" said Gopi.He also suggested the duration of the competition be reduced to three days.","Head coach feels lucrative prize money & better scheduling could draw top stars.

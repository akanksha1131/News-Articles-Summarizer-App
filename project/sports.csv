When Travis Head made the walk to the middle, he was oozing confidence. And why wouldn't he be? He was fresh from a hundred in the pink-ball Test and was batting with a very high degree of domination. The hosts' innings was delicately placed at 75/3 in 33.2 overs and Head joined Steve Smith who was looking very itchy.Getting Head at the other end was just what Smith would have wanted at that stage because the game was soon going to enter the passage of play where India have struggled this series.With the oldish Kookaburra, the visitors have not only found it difficult to make any inroads but also struggled to contain the flow of runs. And Rohit Sharma & Co. now had to deal with their 'nemesis', who was in terrific touch.The match situation was very much in India's control when Head walked out but what happened next was a rerun of what we have seen plenty of times in the past.In a matter of 10-12 overs, majority of which were bowled by Jasprit Bumrah , Head got his eye in and started feasting on anything in his radar. The Indian bowlers continued to do him another favour as their lack of execution and proper planning was on display during the post-Lunch session.Yet again, he wasn't peppered with chin music early on and was given a very warm reception by the Indian attack. Rohit Sharma shuffled things up in the attack but clear lack of sustained pressure from both ends allowed Head to get well-set when the Indian captain introduced Ravindra Jadeja in the 53rd over. Mohammed Siraj was handed over the responsibility from the other end and it was during this period where Head moved to domination mode and continued to pile on the pressure in free-flowing fashion.The field was now spread out, easy singles were there for the taking and the bowlers clearly lacked fuel in the tank. Not just the bowlers but even Rohit wore a very helpless look as the visiting camp didn't seem to have any way of keeping a known threat under check.It wasn't the first time Head was doing what he did. But what is more frustrating is the fact that as a group, India are yet to crack the code!Do they have answers when they run into him again? Doesn't look like it.At the end of day's play, India bowling coach Morne Morkel said they had the plans figured out for Head but it was the lack of execution between Over No. 50-80 which cost them dearly and let the game slip away from a very firm grip.""Yes we've got the game plans, but are we executing those game plans with a softer ball from both ends, that's something we need to discuss and get better at,"" said Morkel.India clearly didn't learn their lesson after what happened in the Adelaide Test and if no drastic changes are made to the approach against the left-hander, more runs and tons are in store. He has already scored 392 runs in the four innings and his impact can be assessed from the next best contributor from the Australian line-up: Alex Carey. The wicketkeeper-batter has just one third of Head's runs. More than Head's runs, it's the strike rate - nearly 95 - at which he has been scoring which has hurt India more.As Steve Smith explained in the press-conference, the change in the Kookaburra ball is suiting Head's style of play as his numbers and strike rate have drastically shot up since it was changed back in 2021. Unlike the previous version, this ball doesn't lose its hardness even after getting old and ""bounces off the bat a lot harder"".""I think the ball stays hard. So if you get through that period and, you know, you've got some guys like Travis and Marshy and Alex coming in, the ball still bounces off the bat a lot harder than it used to. You know, I think previously you get to those positions where the ball gets a bit softer. You'll see catches in front of the wicket and things like that. And it'd be a bit more difficult to score. But, yeah, I think theball's definitely staying harder,"" explains Smith.In Head's case, however, it seems to be flying off his blade and India seems to have no means to clip its wings.",Travis Head has scored 392 runs in the four innings so far. India bowling coach Morne Morkel said they had the plans figured out for Head but it was the lack of execution between Over No. 50-80 which cost them dearly. Head's strike rate - nearly 95 - at which he has been scoring is hurting India more.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116339140,imgsize-38366,width-400,resizemode-4/116339140.jpg"

Morkel backs struggling Jadeja

NEW DELHI: India's bowling coach Morne Morkel acknowledged on Sunday that their bowlers struggled to implement strategies against Australian batter Travis Head 's century. He emphasised the need for improvement, particularly during the crucial period between overs 50 and 80 with the older ball.Head and Steve Smith 's partnership proved devastating as they accumulated 171 runs in 31 overs during the final session of day two at the Brisbane Test , following a wicketless afternoon session.The Australian team finished strongly at 405 for seven.""First of all, we can say he's (Head) in pretty good form. But I think for us with the ball, if you look at it from overs 50 to 80, even in the last game, is where we fall short, leaking (runs) a little bit. So, that's one area I think we need to get better at,"" said Morkel in the post-day press conference.The bowling coach noted that despite securing three morning wickets, the Indian bowlers lost their grip on the match.""First up with the ball this morning, we were pretty good, at 3 for 70, but took nothing away from two world-class players, Smith we know, he's a guy who also can bat long and score runs. They (Smith and Head) put a partnership there and put us under pressure with a softer ball.""It's definitely an area that we need to focus on, maybe deeper in the innings. Yes, we've got the game plans, but are we executing those game plans with a softer ball from both ends? That's something we need to get better at,"" he continued.Discussing the strategy for Head, which proved unsuccessful, the former South African bowler explained their approach.""Our plan going into this game was to bowl a little bit more over the wicket, a straighter line. We felt he played it quite nicely in Adelaide when we came around (the wicket). The margins to him are just so small and like I said, once he's in, what is the best way for the team and for you (is) to maybe slow down the scoring rate because you know he's going to be aggressive.""The best way (of controlling Head) is bringing a little bit of control into the game and like I said, from over 50 with that softer ball, that's where we're leaking (runs). When Head comes on straight, the pitch kind of feels to (be favourable) a side,"" he added.""I'm not taking anything away from that, but it is a venue where getting used to bowling the right length and trusting that, it does take a bit of time.""While praising Jasprit Bumrah 's five-wicket performance, Morkel defended Mohammed Siraj and Akash Deep's contributions.""I thought Akash did really well, he bowled his heart out, same for Siraj. Siraj struggled, cramped, early on in the day, so, for him to still run in, close and bowl short balls and bowl that new ball spell for me, was great.""""Of course, you need somebody to back him (Bumrah) up, but I honestly can't fault the effort from the other seamers today.""Akash asked good questions with the new ball up front, asked good questions with the older ball and on another day could have easily picked up three wickets, but that's the nature of this game,"" he concluded.Morkel expressed support for Ravindra Jadeja , who was selected in place of R Ashwin for this Test match, despite his challenging performance.At the 'Gabba', Jadeja bowled 16 overs without taking any wickets while conceding 76 runs.""Jaddu, coming into this match didn't haven't had a lot of game time, but he's also a guy who has taken a lot of Test wickets. He's a very experienced player and we just felt we wanted to bring in the left-arm option as something different, you know, sitting with Rohit.""""Jaddu is a guy that can also offer us a lot with the bat, unfortunately, today if you know it wasn't his day as a spinner. But, yeah, Jaddu for me is a world-class player and you know he'll work it out,"" he added.Regarding the decision to bowl first after winning the toss, Morkel explained their strategy was based on their confidence in containing the Australian batting lineup.""I just thought, looking at the surface, if we can get the ball in the right area we can take wickets. I thought controlling the run-rate for a big part of the game and staying patient was key and if we could have added one or two wickets, winning the toss and bowling first would have worked.""But unfortunately we are on the other side of it and we just need to take the positives out of it. So, when we do get that opportunity tomorrow it's about getting through the new ball because I honestly feel like it's a bit of a new ball surface.""For us it's important now to put today aside and get our minds switched on and stay strong for a big batting innings,"" he added",India's bowling coach Morne Morkel admits bowlers struggled to implement strategies against Australian batter Travis Head's century. Head and Steve Smith accumulated 171 runs in 31 overs during the final session of day two at the Brisbane Test.

Shubman Gill: 'We will treat it as a three-match Test series'

It was a frustrating morning of waiting in Brisbane as heavy downpour allowed very little cricket on the opening day of the third India-Australia Test in Brisbane. Only 13.2 overs were bowled and the fans got their umbrellas out, put the raincoats on but held on to their beer and enjoyed their Saturday morning, even if it was without any cricket.With the players rushing indoors, the gentleman on the live grill was aggressively dishing out the sausages to the thousands who had come for a big fat party!Amid all this, former Australia cricketer Matthew Hayden 's daughter was casually strolling in the corridor with very little cricket a dampener for her too. The 22-year-old, however, was still up for a chat on cricket and touched upon her love for India, the food and the spices.""I love India. I always heard a lot about India growing up from my dad, he still brings spices home. So I'd always be trying Indian food. I love a dal curry and a roti. Love your roti. Dad would always bring India home to us. So people would always say to me, you know, 'did you struggle at first with Indian food?' And I said, 'No, I love it',"" said Grace in a candid chat with TimesofIndia.com.Having watched a lot of cricket herself on the television, and even from the ground, she follows the circuit very closely and is a big fan of India wicketkeeper-batter Rishabh Pant . It took her half a second to name Pant has her favourite cricketer from this Indian team and it was the youngster's return from the horrific car crash which continues to be an inspiration.""I think his comeback story has been sensational. We saw him go as the most expensive player in IPL history just recently. And yeah, we all saw the vision of the accident, and for him to come back and still start and even make this incredible team is just credit to him. The hard work, determination, mentally that would have been really tough to come back from. Obviously I'm Australian, but I'm proud of him, and he obviously has great strength as a player, as a person. He's always been exceptionally lovely. He's definitely an inspiring player,"" says Grace.Pant is definitely a crowd favourite in this part of the world but the same can't be said about Mohammed Siraj. The seamer was constantly booed when he stood on top of his run-up today and even while the series has been a bit low-key on the onfield drama, the Travis Head-Siraj episode definitely injected some fire. Has the IPL, like the rain today, dampened the intensity between these two sides as compared to the years gone by?""I think because the IPL is around, these players are playing together more often. They're intertwining all the time. But I think when you are stepping onto the field playing for your country, none of that matters, and it always has been the case you want to win for your country,"" said Grace and added that her father himself was a fierce competitor on the field but completely different off it.""My dad is a big teddy bear giant. Like when you actually meet him in person off the field... but as soon as he stepped on the field, he was like a new person,"" added Grace.The ongoing Border-Gavaskar Trophy is locked at 1-1 but Grace reckons Australia are going to pocket the next three Tests to make it 4-1.

NEW DELHI: In a bizarre turn of events, third umpire Anantha Padmanabhan stirred up chaos, changing the on-field wide decision and then re-reversing it during the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy Final clash between Mumbai and Madhya Pradesh in Bengaluru on Sunday.The entire episode turned into an embarrassment as the umpire gaffe saw him apologising for his mistake right at the end of the first innings.The drama unfolded on the final ball of the MP innings, when Shardul Thakur fired in a full ball wide outside the off stump to a shuffling MP captain Rajat Patidar.Despite Patidar going across, the on-field umpire signalled it as a wide.Mumbai then sent the on-field decision upstairs which the third umpire turned, deeming it as a legal delivery.A stunned Patidar then refused to leave the field and gestured to the on-field umpires where the ball had pitched. The MP skipper then had a word with the square-leg umpire and the third umpire was forced to re-visit his decision.As the ball had pitched outside the marker, the Patidar shuffle did not matter and should have been given a wide.Realising his bad call, third umpire Ananthapadmanabhan then said on-air, ""Extremely sorry, the ball had pitched outside the popping crease. I did not see that"", overturning his own initial non-wide call to wide in a chaotic end.Patidar then hit the final legal ball of the over over the fence for a maximum as MP finished at 174 for eight.Mumbai however chased down the target in just 17.5 overs to clinch the title.","Third umpire Anantha Padmanabhan stirs up chaos, changing the on-field wide decision and then re-reversing it during the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy Final.

DOTTIN BACK WITH GG

BENGALURU: After an underwhelming inaugural Women’s Premier League season with UP Warriorz, Simran Shaikh watched the previous edition of the competition as a spectator. Going unsold in last season’s auction, the 22-year-old all-rounder went back to the drawing board and delivered for Mumbai in the domestic season. She reaped the rewards to become the most expensive buy at the mini auction held here on Sunday.With a base price of Rs 10 lakh, Simran spurred a bidding war between Gujarat Giants and Delhi Capitals, before the former put out the winning bid of Rs 1.9 crore.With just 19 slots to be filled from 124 players, the auction was probably one of the quickest and wrapped up in under two hours, but not before uncapped Indian talent hit pay dirt.Tamil Nadu’s rising star G Kamalini, one among four who surpassed the crore mark on the day, was another sought-after youngster, snapped up by Mumbai Indians, who beat persistent Delhi Capitals, with a Rs. 1.6 crore bid.The all-rounder, a product of the CSK Academy, made a statement of intent in the BCCI Women’s U-19 T20 Trophy recently. The 16-year-old big hitter compiled 311 runs from eight matches to help Tamil Nadu annex the title. Currently wearing the India colours at the U-19 Asia Cup in Malaysia, the left-handed batter was the 'Player of the Match' on Sunday for her unbeaten 29-ball 44 against Pakistan.Although Delhi Capitals had a rather quiet day, they increased the bidding amount for most of the big buys. Among them was Uttarakhand spinner Prema Rawat, who started at a base price of Rs 10 lakh and was offered the winning bid of Rs 1.20 crore by defending champions Royal Challengers Bengaluru. RCB added the leg spinner to their stable in addition to Asha Sobhana.The 23-year-old Prema garnered attention during the Uttarakhand Premier League. Turning out for Mussoorie Thunders, she came good with both the ball and the bat.Giants, who went into the auction with the maximum purse of Rs 4.4 crore, also accounted for the second highest bid. West Indies’ Deandra Dottin, who was controversially released by the Giants days before the inaugural edition, returned to the franchise for Rs 1.70 crore.The first player to go under the hammer, the 33-year-old Dottin was among the three players with the Rs 50 lakh base price.Among the players who surprisingly went unsold were Sneh Rana, England skipper Heather Knight, her compatriot Lauren Bell and Australian Laura Harris.","Simran Shaikh was the most expensive buy at the mini auction held here on Sunday.

India bowling coach Morne Morkel explains why India chose to bowl first in Brisbane

Steve Smith: 'I had a great seat in the house to watch Travis Head bat'

BRISBANE: Sunday at the Gabba was mainly a rerun of the Travis Head Experience, this time in extended format.By Head’s side stood the formidable Steve Smith , who battled inner demons to rediscover his poise, technique and, eventually, fluency. Both scored centuries — Head his ninth and third against India, Smith his 33rd — to completely overwhelm India’s Jasprit Bumrah-led bowling attack.In the form of his life, the left-handed Head, Australia’s middle-order enforcer, reprised India’s Adelaide nightmare with his second consecutive ton. He did all this while looking like he was coasting on Queensland’s Bruce Highway, pressing the pedal to the metal while reclining in a plush leather seat.Head’s innings was batting magnificence made to look easy. He continued from where he left off in Adelaide, conjuring up a 152 off 160 balls (18x4) and adding 241 runs off 302 balls for the fourth wicket with Smith (101 off 190b; 12x4).By the end of it all, India looked tired, dispirited and bereft of ideas, but their task on the field is not over yet. Stumps were taken with the Aussie tail still wagging at 405/7 and Alex Carey batting on a well-made 45.Only Bumrah the Magnificent (5/72 off 25 overs) stood tall with his 12th five wicket haul from just 43 Tests. He started off by disrupting the Aussie openers’ plans of blunting the sheen on the Kookaburra, then returned with the second new ball to limit the considerable damage by getting rid of Smith, Head and Mitchell Marsh.Bumrah lacked any real support, however, in spite of Akash Deep looking penetrative in patches and earning praise from Steve Smith. When the ball got old, conditions eased and the pitch seemed sterile, India’s lack of bowling depth stood exposed.Head and Smith’s partnership brought back memories of the 285-run stand between the two in the World Test Championship final against India at the Oval in June 2023, and now, like then, they came in with the side in trouble after Marnus Labuschagne’s dismissal. At the Oval, Australia were 76/3, on Sunday here they were 75/3.The early damage was thanks to the genius of Bumrah, who made the still new ball his ally and rectified some errors from the first day. This time he found the fuller length straightaway, the five to eight metre mark, drawing Usman Khawaja forward and regularly beating the bat, both off the inside and outside edge. Bowling around the wicket, he found success in just his second over, getting Khawaja to prod at one. The batter was stuck in his crease and edged to the ’keeper.The compact McSweeney, who kept leaving balls at length on the first day and evaded facing Bumrah, was dislodged with a back-of-a-length ball that came in with the angle and straightened after pitching, forcing the batter to play and edge to Kohli at second slip. Meanwhile, Labuschagne wafted at an innocuous Nitish Reddy delivery and paid the price.That set the stage for the Travis Head special. By this stage Steve Smith was still his fidgety, scratchy self, still looking for his first century in 25 innings. A return to an altered, exaggerated back-and-across trigger movement seemed to help. Smith shouldered arms to a Siraj nip-backer and was saved by the ‘umpire’s call’. Akash Deep foxed him time and again, but Smith survived. Head’s entry ensured India’s full attention and Smith could slip “under the radar,” as he said later.India immediately went on the defensive to Head, with a deep point, square leg hanging back, a deep gully, mid-on and mid-off back, but it’s impossible really to cut off Head’s scoring areas. Luck was with him too, and he survived some early jitters. After lunch, with the ball softer at 43 overs old, Head got into his act, racing to his half-century and taking a special liking to Ravindra Jadeja and Mohammed Siraj.India’s attempts to bowl short to him didn’t come off, and Head kept pulling or ramping those deliveries over the slip cordon. He unsettled Jadeja’s lengths and India’s fielders followed the ball. Plugging every new gap created large gaps to exploit.Australia scored 130 in 27 overs between lunch and tea (overs 43-70) and 63 in the first 10 overs after tea. Head had taken the game away from an increasingly nervy India. Captain Rohit Sharma even dropped Head on 112, but the second new ball and a burst of wickets from, who else but Bumrah, stopped the rampage.It’s now clear Head’s repeated onslaughts have left the “scar” which captain Rohit denied after the Adelaide loss. “He’s in pretty good form, playing back to-back innings in that fashion, we can only give him a lot of credit,” India’s bowling coach Morne Morkel said. “Our plan was to bowl a little more over the wicket, bowl a straighter line. We felt he played it quite nicely in Adelaide when we came around the wicket. We were lucky there was a little bit of bounce, but the margin to him is just so thin.”A delighted Smith said he had the “best seat in the house to watch Travis Head go about his business”. “He’s doing it consistently at the moment, which is great. It was nice to get a partnership with him because the scoreboard moves extremely fast.”India are now behind in this game, and seeing the conditions the decision to bowl first may come back to haunt them.",Travis Head and Steve Smith both score centuries against India. Head scores 152 off 160 balls (18x4) and adds 241 runs for the fourth wicket. Smith scores 101 off 190b; 12x4.

Steve Smith: 'I had a great seat in the house to watch Travis Head bat'

India bowling coach Morne Morkel explains why India chose to bowl first in Brisbane

BRISBANE: The ‘Gabbatoir’ has lived up to its name. India find themselves pinned down in the third Test. Till now, the focus has been on the team’s faltering batting unit and lead pacer Jasprit Bumrah ’s absolute mastery of conditions and clever reading of batsmen. Here on Day Two, when the other bowlers were at times required to deliver, another area of concern was highlighted: India’s inability to execute their plans with the older Kookaburra ball in good batting conditions.The bowling attack on this tour wears a Jekyll-and-Hyde look — menacing when Bumrah is bowling, sheepish when he is given a break. This allowed Travis Head, whose previous three outings at the Gabba had yielded ducks, and Steve Smith to cash in between lunch and tea and for a while after, until the second new ball became available.Bumrah then again rose to the occasion, but he is a rare breed of bowler. The team management will be aware such overreliance may lead to workload issues on this long tour, putting the focus on the others who need to step up. Captain Rohit Sharma had spoken about the need for the other pacers to “rise to the challenge” after the Adelaide loss, and Sunday showed why such concern was warranted.India’s decision to replace Harshit Rana with Akash Deep seemed on the money, with the relatively inexperienced pacer beating Smith with movement and steep bounce even with the older ball. He was luckless, however, while Siraj was unidimensional and also battled cramps, according to bowling coach Morne Morkel The fourth seamer, Nitish Reddy, and the surprise lone spin selection Ravindra Jadeja were serious weak links, bowling 29 overs for 141 runs and one wicket. Importantly, between lunch and tea Australia scored at 4.8 per over. It is starting with this period, from after the 40 till the 80th over, that India struggled with the new, redesigned Kookaburra red ball.“If you look at it from overs 50-80 (when the second new ball is due), even in the last game we fell short, leaking runs a little bit. Yes, we’ve got the game plans, but are we executing those plans with a softer ball from both ends? That’s something we need to get better at,” Morkel said.“I thought Akash did really well. He bowled his heart out, same for Siraj. Siraj struggled, cramped, early on in the day, so, for him to still run in and bowl short balls, and bowl that new ball spell was great,” he added.“Of course, you need somebody to back Bumrah up, but I honestly can’t fault the effort from the other seamers today. Akash asked good questions with the new ball up front, asked good questions with the older ball and on another day could have easily picked up three wickets. That’s the nature of this game,” Morkel said.Steve Smith, who seemed stuck in a rut for more than a year until he rediscovered some semblance of form with a fine century on Sunday, too praised Akash Deep. “Akash bowled really nicely, particularly that first spell. There was significant movement. He bowled a really nice length, he’s a nice bowler. It was the first time I’ve actually faced him. He’s got some skill for sure. They (India’s bowlers) toiled hard all day,” he said.Smith also explained why the changed Kookaburra ball has necessitated a shift in gameplans. “Since 2021 when they changed the Kookaburra ball (adding an extra layer of lacquer and a more pronounced seam), batting has become very difficult (in Australia). The first 35 overs are very challenging, with significant movement,” he said.“The ball stays hard. So, if you get through that period, you’ve got guys like Travis Head and Mitch Marsh who can come in when the ball still bounces off the bat a little harder. Earlier, they would come in when the ball gets a bit softer, so you’ll see catches in front of the wicket and things like that, and it’d be a bit more difficult to score. The last three years, batting averages have come down, bowling aver ages have come down. Earlier you would see 400-500 being scored. Now if you put a ‘three’ in front of it, it’s okay.”Australia have already worked the ball out and altered their batting plans accordingly. The openers will blunt the new Kookaburra and play in sedate fashion. Once the 35-40 over mark is met, the middle-order bashers can take over. India were caught napping with the ball on Sunday. Now, the bowlers have their work cut out for the rest of this game, and the series.",India bowling coach Morne Morkel explains why India chose to bowl first in Brisbane.

In the process, Hamanpreet Kaur & Co would’ve also regained some of their confidence, which would’ve been shattered after the drubbing in Australia.Shrugging off jet lag after playing an ODI series which ended in Perth only on Wednesday, India, egged on by a strong 29,000 holiday crowd at the DY Patil Stadium here on Sunday night, scored a convincing 49-run victory over a lacklustre West Indies, who hardly played like the 2024 Women’s T20 World Cup semifinalists, in the opening WT20I here. The second match of the three-game series will be played on Tuesday at the same venue.Powered by Jemimah Rodrigues ’ sublime 35-ball 73, which included nine-sweetly timed fours and two well-struck sixes, and vice-captain Smriti Mandhana ’s 54 (33b, 7x4, 2x6) and the duo’s blazing 81-run partnership in just 44 balls for the second wicket, India posted a massive 195 for four after the hosts were asked to bat first.It is India’s highest-ever T20I total against the West Indies (previous best was 185/4 in November 2019 at Gros Islet) and their third-highest in this format overall.It was then then the turn of the bowlers to come to the party, with seamer Titas Sadhu (3-37 in four overs), and spinners Deepti Sharma (2-21 in four overs) and Radha Yadav (2-28 in four overs) restricting West Indies to 146 for seven in 20 overs.For a brief while, the Caribbeans gave India a scare when veteran allrounder Deandra Dottin (52, 28b, 4x4, 3x6), who was bought by the Gujarat Giants for Rs 1.7 cr by the Gujarat Giants on Sunday in the WPL mini-auction, and opener Qiana Joseph (49, 33b, 5x4, 3x6) were at the crease. India had the game in the bag when Dottin, who was dropped twice, was finally caught by Radha Yadav at long on off Sadhu in the 15th over.The hosts were also boosted by a brilliant catch by Minnu Mani, who ran diagonally from mid-on and then dived full length to pull a stunner to send back West Indies’ skipper Hayley Mathews (1) off Sadhu in the second over.Rodrigues has hardly done justice to her immense potential in WT20Is till now. However, perhaps fired up by the home crowd, the Mumbaikar showed why the national selectors have been so patient with her and what fantastic ability she possesses when in full flow. Coming out all guns blazing on a typical batting paradise here, the India No 3 feasted on the erratic West Indies’ bowlers.The 24-year-old’s 12th in WT20Is- will certainly rank amongst the batter’s best innings in this format, even though the West Indies attack was docile, in fact mediocre. By the 11th over, the clueless-looking visitors had used up seven bowlers, and eventually eight had a go with the ball.However, apart from off-spinner Karishma Ramharack (2 for 18 in four overs), the others were just cannon fodder for Rodrigues and the other Indian batters. To make it worse for them, the West Indians bowled 10 wides and grassed four catches too.The stage for India’s massive total was set by Mandhana (she scored her 28th WT20I fifty, sixth this year) and Uma Chetry (24, 26b, 4x4) in a 50-run partnership in 39 balls. Preferred over the explosive Shafali Verma, Chetry showed promise while stroking a few delightful fours on the off-side. Thereafter, it was the 'Rodrigues show' all the way, with Mandhana, coming off a superb century (105) in the final WODI against Australia at Perth on Wednesday, just looking to enjoy herself, as the duo pulverised the West Indian bowlers.Rodrigues’ relentless onslaught had a ‘touch of 360 degree’ -there were shots all around the ground including a few behind the wicket. Having mastered the sweep shot by now, she swept and reverse swept the West Indies’ spinners in dominating fashion, but what was also impressive was her power-hitting-there was a hooked six off medium-pacer Shamilia Connell and a six over long-off off veteran allrounder Deandra Dottin in the 19th over. Just a ball earlier, she had showcased her ability to improvise brilliantly, scooping Dottin for four in the fine-leg region.The finishing touches to India’s innings were provided by Richa Ghosh (20, 14b, 2x4, 1x6). Ghosh’s cameo ended when Dottin pouched a superb catch at deep mid-wicket off Mandy Mangru in the 17th over.",India beat West Indies by 49 runs in opening WT20I at DY Patil Stadium. Smriti Mandhana and Jemimah Rodrigues top scored with 54 runs each. Hosts posted 195-4 after being asked to bat first. Second match of three-game series will be played on Tuesday.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116350910,imgsize-46402,width-400,resizemode-4/116350910.jpg"

BENGALURU: The likes of Ajinkya Rahane and Shreyas Iyer dominated with the bat in the run up to the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy final . But on Sunday, against Madhya Pradesh in the title-decider, India’s T20 captain Suryakumar Yadav came to the party while Suryansh Shedge provided the final flourish as Mumbai ran away to a fivewicket win to claim their second domestic T20 title at the packed M Chinnaswamy Stadium.After Rajat Patidar (81, 40b, 6x4, 6x6) took Madhya Pradesh to 174/8, Mumbai reached the target with 13 balls to spare.A stunning hitting display at the end by Shedge (36, 15b, 3x4, 3x6) came after Surya (48, 35b, 4x4, 3x6) helped them complete their domination in the competition.However, it was not an easy chase for Mumbai after losing Prithvi Shaw and Shreyas inside the powerplay. And with Rahane (37, 30b, 4x4) not able to strike the ball as well as he did earlier in the event, there was a serious need for Surya to bring his A game.The batter, who had 14 runs in his last three matches, got into his own gradually. It was a bit tricky with spinners getting some grip off the surface.",Mumbai beat Madhya Pradesh by five wickets in Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy final.

The slightly tacky pitch offered some challenges, but Mumbai ultimately prevailed.This victory marks Mumbai's second SMAT title, their first coming in 2022.

Manchester City vs Manchester United Predicted Lineups

Manchester City:

Manchester United:

NEW DELHI: Manchester City and Manchester United head into Sunday’s derby at the Etihad Stadium seeking a much-needed boost amid ongoing struggles.City (8-4-3, 27 points) are in unfamiliar territory, with only one win in their last 10 matches (1-7-2) across all competitions. A 3-0 league victory over Nottingham Forest and a 2-2 draw with Crystal Palace earlier this month marked slight improvements, but Pep Guardiola’s side is still in fourth place, eight points behind league leaders Liverpool, who have a game in hand.Kevin De Bruyne’s recent return from injury, highlighted by a goal and an assist against Forest, has provided some hope, but the absence of Rodri for the rest of the season compounds City’s woes. A 2-0 defeat to Juventus in the Champions League midweek leaves them at risk of missing the knockout phase with two games remaining. Despite the setbacks, Guardiola defended his team, stating, “The soul and spirit of this team is there.”United (5-6-4, 19 points) are also enduring a tough stretch under new manager Ruben Amorim, who will experience his first Manchester derby. United sit 13th in the table, with just one win in four league games under Amorim—a convincing 4-0 victory over Everton featuring braces from Marcus Rashford and Joshua Zirkzee. Rashford, however, has since fallen out of the starting lineup.Amorim, known for his success in derbies while managing Sporting Lisbon, struck a cautious tone, acknowledging that the match doesn’t carry the high stakes typically associated with a City-United clash. “It should be two great teams fighting for the title,” he admitted. “But it is not that at the moment. Both teams are struggling.”The Manchester City vs Manchester United derby is scheduled to kick off at 10:00 PM IST. For viewers in the United Kingdom, the match will begin at 4:30 PM. In the United States, it is set to start at 11:30 AM Eastern Time.Ortega, Walker, Dias, Simpson-Pusey, Gvardiol, Kovacic, Silva, Foden, De Bruyne, Nunes, Haaland.Onana, Mazraoui, De Ligt, Martinez, Diallo, Mainoo, Ugarte, Dalot, Fernandes, Garnacho, Hojlund.","Manchester City and Manchester United head into Sunday's derby seeking a much- needed boost amid ongoing struggles.

GOOD DRAW

PERSISTENT FOREST

Premier League leaders Liverpool salvaged a 2-2 draw at home to Fulham despite trailing twice and having Andy Robertson sent off after 17 minutes on Saturday as chasing Arsenal were left to rue being held to 0-0 stalemate at home to Everton.On what turned out to be a good day for second-placed Chelsea, who face Brentford on Sunday, Liverpool would have been far happier with their draw than title rivals Arsenal.Diogo Jota scored an 86th minute equaliser at Anfield as Arne Slot's side avoided a second league defeat of the season.They have 36 points from 15 games, five more than Chelsea, while Arsenal's failure to score at home for the first time this season left them still six points off the pace having played one game more than the two sides above them.Nottingham Forest moved above champions Manchester City into fourth place as late goals by Nikola Milenkovic and Anthony Elanga saw them hit back to beat visiting Aston Villa 2-1.Newcastle United returned to form in emphatic style as they thrashed Leicester City 4-0 with Jacob Murphy scoring twice.At the bottom, the pressure increased on Wolverhampton Wanderers manager Gary O'Neil as his side lost 2-1 at home to fellow strugglers Ipswich Town.Jack Taylor scored a last-gasp winner for 18th-placed Ipswich who are now only one point from the safety zone. Wolves, in 19th, have now lost four league games in succession.There are good draws and bad draws and Liverpool's will definitely feel like the former as they emerged from a difficult afternoon with minimal damage at Anfield.""A great comeback is very positive. It's disappointing having 10 men but we showed fight, kept trying to create chances. Could have been more but we take the point and move on,"" Liverpool skipper Virgil van Dijk said.""Stay calm. It's easier to say than do it. It was always going to be tough against them.""Liverpool got off to the worst possible start as Fulham took the lead in 11th minute through Andreas Pereira's stretching volley and then left back Robertson was dismissed, after a long VAR check, for denying Harry Wilson a goalscoring opportunity.Cody Gakpo's diving header from a Mohamed Salah cross brought Liverpool level straight after halftime and they were chasing the win when Rodrigo Muniz stunned the hosts to put Fulham back in front after 76 minutes.However, Jota came off the bench in the 79th minute for his first appearance since October because of injury and slotted past goalkeeper Bernd Leno in the 86th to salvage a point.ARSENAL FRUSTRATEDArsenal failed to score at home for the first time since April as they could not find a way through a blue Everton barricade at The Emirates.Despite overwhelming pressure they lacked attacking spark and even when they did get a sight of goal England goalkeeper Jordan Pickford proved unflappable, making great saves from Bukayo Sako, Martin Odegaard and Gabriel Martinelli.Everton barely ventured forward but celebrated a gritty point which left them in 15th place with 15 points.""Very disappointing not to win the game. We fully deserved to win the game,"" Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta said.""We conceded no shots. We dominated play. When we generated big chances we didn't score a goal.""Forest have now won six of their last nine league games after showing great persistence to overturn a deficit against Villa at a raucous City Ground.Jhon Duran's header had looked like sending Villa fourth, especially when Forest's in-form striker Chris Wood had a late leveller wiped out for offside after a long VAR check.But Milenkovic headed in a cross by Morgan Gibbs-White in the 87th minute before substitute Elanga slotted home his first goal of the season to claim all three points.Ipswich secured only their second win of the season as substitute Taylor struck in the 94th minute at Molineux.An unfortunate own goal by Matt Doherty gave Ipswich an early lead but Wolves were rewarded for a positive response when Brazilian forward Matheus Cunha, assisted by Goncalo Guedes, finished past keeper Arijanet Muric.Newcastle's first win in five league games lifted them to 11th with 23 points, only four points behind fourth-placed Manchester City who host Manchester United on Sunday.",Premier League leaders Liverpool salvaged a 2-2 draw at home to Fulham despite trailing twice and having Andy Robertson sent off.

Emiliano Martinez , Aston Villa 's goalkeeper, made a remarkable save during their match against Nottingham Forest in the Premier League on Saturday. Albeit, the game ended in a 2-1 loss for Aston Villa.In the 60th minute, Nicolas Dominguez's header seemed destined for the net. Martinez, slightly off his line, extended his left hand backward. He managed to deflect the ball downward and scoop it away from the goal line in one fluid motion.“World class,” was how the Premier League described the save.The BBC considered it potentially ""one of the all-time great Premier League saves.”“I can’t think of a better Premier League save,” said former England and Liverpool midfielder Jamie Redknapp, who was working the game for British broadcaster Sky Sports. “It’s almost like a magician with his sleight of hand.”Jhon Duran scored for Aston Villa shortly after, giving them a temporary lead. This goal came just three minutes after Martinez's incredible save.Nottingham Forest responded with two late goals, securing a 2-1 victory. Both goals were scored after the 87th minute.Martinez has received recognition for his goalkeeping prowess. He was named the best goalkeeper at the Ballon d'Or awards for the past two years.In the 2022 World Cup final, Martinez made a crucial save against Randal Kolo Muani in the final seconds of extra time. This save allowed Argentina to hold on and eventually win the World Cup. The save was instrumental in Lionel Messi achieving his dream of winning a World Cup title.","Aston Villa goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez made a stellar save against Nottingham Forest in the English Premier League.

farewells Sevilla fans

Real Madrid were held at Rayo Vallecano to 3-3 in a thrilling derby on Saturday, missing a chance to overtake Barcelona at the top of La Liga .Rayo set a fast pace and stunned the powerhouse with two headed goals from Unai Lopez and Abdul Mumin to lead 2-0 by the 36th minute.Federico Valverde struck with a powerful shot from well outside the area to pull one back for Madrid then Jude Bellingham headed the visitors level from a pass by Rodrygo just before halftime.Madrid looked on course to completing a comeback win when Rodrygo put them in front for the first time with a deflected shot in the 56th.But Rayo midfield leader Isi Palazon stretched out a boot to steer Florian Lejeune's shot past Thibaut Courtois in the 64th.Madrid was without striker Kylian Mbappe, who is nursing a left-thigh injury.

Goalie Augusto Batalla saved the Brazilian's best effort in the final period.Madrid remained second, one point behind Barcelona.Ancelotti 'satisfied' Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti admitted his team dropped its guard in defense when his players left Lopez and Mumin unchecked to turn in crosses. But he said he was ""satisfied"" with his team's reaction, especially given the injuries to defensive starters Dani Carvajal, Eder Militao, and Ferland Mendy.He also looked to last season, when his team drew twice with Rayo.""Last year we didn't win here, we drew, and we won the league anyway,"" Ancelotti said. ""We are playing well and on the right path. So, we had a draw. We need to look toward the next games.""Madrid, as the Champions League titleholder, next travels to Qatar to play the Intercontinental Cup final against Mexican club Pachuca.""We have a great chance to win a title on Wednesday, which would put the cherry on top of a great year,"" Ancelotti said.Bellingham took his league scoring run to six games in a row.Vinicius will miss the next game at home against Sevilla after picking up his fifth yellow card, this time for protesting.Rayo were in 13th place. The modest club has also held Atletico Madrid to 1-1 and forced Barcelona to rally for a 2-1 thanks to a late goal.""Before the game we talked about all our recent games with Real Madrid when we had been close to winning, so we knew that if they weren't on their game then we could get a good result,"" Rayo coach Inigo Perez said.Sevilla's Jesus Navas bid farewell to his home fans during a 1-0 win over Celta Vigo as he nears the end of his 20-year playing career.Players from both teams wore T-shirts saying ""Navas Legend"" before kickoff. They gave a tearful Navas an honor guard with trophies he won with the club placed on the pitch. Navas wept again, and kneeled to kiss the turf when he was substituted with 20 minutes left.""Jesus has always been my role model, I remember watching him when I was a child,"" Sevilla goal-scorer Manu Bueno said. ""I am so proud to have scored this goal and be able to dedicate it to him.""Navas announced in May he would retire at the end of the year, midway through this season.Navas, who turned 39 last month, debuted for his boyhood club in 2004 and played two stints for Sevilla on either side of his spell at Manchester City from 2013-17 when he helped it win one Premier League.

Lewis Hall headed the ball back across the goal to Bruno Guimares , who headed it into the net.Newcastle's third goal followed shortly after. Conor Coady's attempted clearance inadvertently deflected Hall's cross into the path of Alexander Isak.

Andre Agassi

believes Djokovic will miss Federer & Nadal, the guys he came to the dance with

Excerpts:

Djokovic's longevity:

Andy Murray coaching Djokovic:

Carlos Alcaraz

and longevity…

American men haven't had results like the women:

Graf was the hardest victory I ever had: Agassi

BENGALURU: Andre Agassi wondered if the 24-time major winner Novak Djokovic would miss his greatest rivals -- the now-retired Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer -- in the last leg of a glittering career where the 37-year-old goes for more history.The eight-time Grand Slam champion, in the city for the TiE Global Summit, assessed Djokovic's run and the Serb's recent partnership with friend and rival Andy Murray in a candid chat with media.It's hard to say, Father Time always wins. He has already done so much for so long, it's hard to imagine longer. We said that about (Roger) Federer too. I think Novak will run out of energy more than capability. Cannot be easy, especially when the people you came to the dance with have left, that's a big thing.When Pete (Sampras) retired it was a blow to me, it set me back a little bit. It made me rediscover my inspirations on some level. Djokovic has lost the guys he made history with. It'll probably get tougher and tougher emotionally, but I would never bet against them. Bet against them at your peril.In any coach-student relationship you need trust and trust can take time, but it's nice when it starts with believing in somebody because you know that they know your experience. There's an asset to their history as competitors.Any success of a relationship is based on complete buy-in and that's always the part you have to wait and see. It's not what I know that changes your career, information doesn't lead to transformation, somebody has to counter that. That's the connector. I'm sure there's going to be a lot of trust immediately, we'll see how the results go.Alcaraz defends like Novak, has more power and spin like Nadal, hands and finesse like Federer but just because he has the best of all the three doesn't mean he can do what they did. There are so many parts to the game such as decision-making, injuries, luck. So how long can (Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner) do it (for)? They could do it for 20 years or not.The women's game hasn't had to deal with Roger Federer, Novak Djokovic, Rafael, Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz, but they have their version of it. Serena Williams is the Novak of the women's game and you got Coco as a potential, like Alcaraz has potential and Sinner has potential.How the game evolves is interesting. The women's game has gotten very powerful, just straight power. For lack of a better example, Lindsay Davenport was powerful, tall, precise through the court and now you have a lot of that. There's still room for somebody who can offset that kind of power, like an Ash Barty.The men's game has changed in the sense that guys have gotten bigger with longer levers, which means they're better athletes, they can move and they need more time, they start playing further back. Soon you're going to start seeing the net game start coming back, everything morphs in its own way. But the biggest issue for American (men) not winning is an unfortunate set of decades where the guys were very stingy and very greedy -- 66 Grand Slams in the same generation. There's not a lot left there (for others)!Andre Agassi - the second of five men to achieve a career Grand Slam in the Open Era and the first man to complete a career golden slam - has won it all, including a stirring love match.""She was the hardest victory I ever had,"" said Agassi of his wife German tennis legend Steffi Graf, a 22-time major winner.Agassi, who has won eight major titles and the Olympic gold, speaking during a session at the TiE Global Summit, said, ""We all live a hero's journey - first part of life is about performing and achieving. Then life hits us with broken relationships and dreams. I went through it all. Finally, in the last phase of the journey, it's about serving others.""The 54-year-old said, ""At 28 my (tennis) career started over. Without the struggles, I would've never gotten Steffi to say yes. I tried to get her for years.""On a lighter note, Agassi said he likes to keep his trophies out of the house. ""I don't bring my trophies home, because if I bring my trophies home, then she brings her trophies home - and that's bad math!""",Andre Agassi believes Novak Djokovic will run out of energy more than capability. The eight-time Grand Slam champion is in the city for the TiE Global Summit.

NEW DELHI: Legendary player Andre Agassi observed that Carlos Alcaraz embodies distinct qualities from Novak Djokovic Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal , while advising the tennis world against anticipating the young Spaniard to match the extraordinary achievements of these tennis legends.The collective Grand Slam victories of Federer, Nadal and Djokovic stand at 66, whilst Alcaraz, aged 21, has secured four major titles thus far.""I'm not a genius and I don't have a crystal ball. What I can tell you is Alcaraz defends like Novak, has power and spin like Nadal and has hands and finesse like Federer,"" said Agassi during a talk session in Bengaluru.The eight-time Grand Slam victor Agassi elaborated on why excessive expectations shouldn't burden Alcaraz.""Just because he has the best of all those three doesn't mean he can do what they did because there're so many other parts to the game, which mean decision-making, injuries, you know, luck,"" he said.With Djokovic at 37, approaching retirement, Agassi noted that the Serbian's competitive edge might diminish without Nadal and Federer in the arena.""He's already done so much, so long, and it's hard to imagine longer. I think he'll run out of the energy for it more than the capability of it, I would imagine.""It cannot be easy, especially when the people you came to the dance with have left.""The American provided additional context to his assessment.""When Pete (Sampras) retired, it was a blow to me. It set me back a little bit. It made me have to rediscover my inspirations on some level.""And he's (Djokovic) lost the guys that he's made history with. So, it's probably emotionally going to get tougher and tougher quickly, but I would never bet against him.

NEW DELHI: Tennis icon Andre Agassi on Tuesday highlighted how sports should remain integral to education, noting their role in teaching children to cope with defeat.At a Bengaluru event focussed on sports and education's role in fostering excellence, Agassi shared his insights.""Even when you have a failure, you have to get up and play again the next day. So, what sports is teaching you is that focusing on winning and losing is really a distraction from what we need to be thinking about. We need to be thinking about how to get better,"" he said.Since 2001, Agassi has invested in education for underprivileged children, establishing 130 schools serving approximately 80,000 students in the United States. He attributes this achievement to his persistent drive to overcome obstacles.His demanding tennis career shaped his ability to maintain focus and adapt when necessary.""Sports is all about problem-solving. Tennis taught me how to navigate a very intense environment and maintain my objectivity and problem-solving abilities. It forces me to be present, but also to understand the context of what I'm doing,"" Agassi said.Regarding his earlier defiant period, Agassi acknowledged it as a necessary phase in his journey.""Vulnerability is essential for growth, and I think vulnerability eventually leads to humility,"" he added.He recognised technology's crucial role in education, particularly in providing individualised learning opportunities for children. This belief influenced his investment in the Indian EdTech company, Square Panda .""I think technology can play an essential role, not just in scalability, but also in optimising personalised learning. That's why I got involved with Square Panda.

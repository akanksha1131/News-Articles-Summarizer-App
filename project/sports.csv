NEW DELHI: Wicketkeeper-batter Sanju Samson has hit a purple patch, notching up 3 centuries in his last six competitive matches that includes a Duleep Trophy ton and is determined to make the most of his current form.Samson on Friday smacked a remarkable 50-ball 107 against South Africa, his second consecutive T20I century, following his impressive 111 runs against Bangladesh.The recent solid performances have helped Samson shed the label of an inconsistent performer.""Really enjoyed my time out there in the middle. I made maximum utilisation of my current form you can say,"" Samson said after collecting his player of the match award following India's 61-run win over South Africa in the first T20I.Following India's resounding 61-run victory over South Africa in the series opener in Durban, Samson highlighted on the importance of intent.""The intent, we have been talking about being aggressive and keeping the team ahead of yourselves. Once you play three-four balls you are looking for the boundary,"" said Samson.Samson acknowledged the approach to batting involves a degree of risk but he is looking to maintain a fearless mindset at the crease.""I'm not thinking much, sometimes it pays off, sometimes it doesn't. I am happy it worked out well today.""India skipper Suryakumar Yadav also commended Samson's dedication and hard work over the past ten years. Surya highlighted Samson's commitment to putting in the effort behind the scenes.""The amount of hard work he has done in the last 10 years, doing the boring work, he is eating the fruits of that. He was in the 90s but still he was looking for a boundary, playing for the team and shows the character of the man and that's what we look for,"" Suryakumar said.","Wicketkeeper-batter Sanju Samson has hit a purple patch, notching up 3 centuries in his last six competitive matches that includes a Duleep Trophy ton.

NEW DELHI: The uncertainty over Team India's travel to Pakistan for the upcoming ICC Champions Trophy in February next year continues.Reports emerged Friday that BCCI had informed Pakistan Cricket Board that it won't send the Indian team to Pakistan for the tournament. TOI understands BCCI has conveyed its wish to play its matches in Dubai. But PCB chief Mohsin Naqvi denied receiving any formal communication from BCCI.ICC has set no deadline for declaring the tournament fixtures. ICC usually tries to announce these details at least three months in advance. BCCI had delayed announcing the ODI World Cup fixtures last year after PCB objected to playing in Ahmedabad.As per standard practice, BCCI must obtain clearance from the Indian govt before taking any call on team's travel to Pakistan.""BCCI's stance remains unaltered. The board doesn't take any call without the govt's nod. It has been communicated to PCB that the Indian team is unlikely to travel to Pakistan,"" a BCCI source told TOI on Friday.Minister of External Affairs S Jaishankar's recent visit to Pakistan had raised hopes in cricketing circles that India might agree to play in Pakistan.It is learnt that the board decided on Dubai after talking to the Indian team management. ""If India play their matches in Dubai, it will be convenient for PCB to host the matches there. It's a short flight from Pakistan to Dubai and other teams will not be averse to the idea,"" the source added.""Till today, no one has discussed any hybrid model with us nor are we willing to talk about it. But we have been showing good gestures for the last few years and no one should expect us to do it all the time,"" Naqvi told reporters in Lahore on Friday evening.PCB had agreed on a hybrid model while hosting the Asia Cup in 2023 with India playing all their matches in Sri Lanka. Pakistan had eventually agreed to play India in Ahmedabad during the ODI World Cup as well.As things stand, if things don't change on BCCI's front, PCB will have to take the matter to the ICC where incumbent BCCI secretary Jay Shah , who assumes office as chairman of the ICC on Dec 1, will have to take a decision on the issue. As per policy, ICC doesn't interfere in any country's diplomatic policies.Sources said BCCI wants the decision on this issue to be taken before Shah takes charge as ICC's chairman.If PCB eventually agrees to the hybrid model, it will be interesting to see which venue ICC suggests for the final. ""Ideally, the final should be played in Dubai. One should not have an ambiguous venue for the final. Other teams also must know in advance where the final of such an important tournament will be played,"" said the source.PCB had reportedly floated the idea of Indian team setting up a base in Chandigarh and travelling to Lahore only on match days. However, that idea is deemed as a logistical nightmare.",BCCI tells Pakistan Cricket Board that it won't send Indian team to Pakistan for the tournament.

NEW DELHI: India defeated South Africa by 61 runs in the first T20I of the four-match series, thanks to a record-breaking innings by Sanju Samson and a commanding performance from India‚Äôs bowlers.Chasing a target of 203, South Africa could only muster 141 all out in 17.5 overs in Durban as India secured a dominant victory to take a 1-0 lead.After winning the toss and opting to bowl, South Africa faced an onslaught led by Samson, whose explosive knock of 107 off 50 balls featured ten towering sixes and seven fours.His powerful innings equaled Rohit Sharma's record for the most sixes in a T20I innings by an Indian player, a milestone Rohit had set against Sri Lanka in 2017.Samson‚Äôs whirlwind century gave India a strong foundation, and despite a few quick wickets, they finished with a competitive 202/8 in their 20 overs.Abhishek Sharma (7 off 8) tried to give India a quick start but fell early to Gerald Coetzee , while captain Suryakumar Yadav (21 off 17) contributed before departing at 90/2 in the ninth over.Tilak Varma added a quick 33 off 18 balls, supporting Samson as he continued his aggressive onslaught.Despite losing wickets toward the end, India crossed the 200-run mark, setting South Africa a challenging target.South Africa‚Äôs response was shaky from the outset. Skipper Aiden Markram fell for eight, edging to Samson off Arshdeep Singh ‚Äôs bowling in the first over.The Indian bowlers capitalized on the early breakthrough, with Varun Chakaravarthy and Ravi Bishnoi striking at regular intervals.Chakaravarthy dismissed key Proteas batters Heinrich Klaasen (25) and David Miller (18), while Bishnoi‚Äôs three-wicket haul dismantled the South African lower order.With the required run rate soaring, South Africa's middle order struggled to find boundaries.Gerald Coetzee provided a brief resistance with 23 off 11 balls before falling to an unfortunate run-out at the hands of Indian skipper Suryakumar Yadav.India‚Äôs bowlers executed their plans to perfection, with Bishnoi (3/28) and Chakaravarthy (3/25) leading the charge.Samson‚Äôs record-breaking century and India‚Äôs clinical bowling ensured a comfortable win, setting the tone for the remainder of the series.","India defeated South Africa by 61 runs in the first T20I of the four-match series.

Chopra wrote, expressing utter shock.The incident occurred while Harris was on 48, facing a delivery from Kotian that drifted in and seemed to nick his bat before heading to the first slip, where the catch was cleanly taken.However, the on-field umpire, Mike Graham-Smith, dismissed the appeal, leaving India A players visibly frustrated.As Harris stood his ground, commentators observed that the ball had likely edged the bat, though Harris later suggested the sound might have come from his bat brushing his pad.Ultimately, Harris continued his innings, reaching a half-century before being caught behind by Prasidh Krishna on 74.This decision fueled discussions across social media, with Kotian later labelling it as a ‚Äúhorrible‚Äù decision.Despite replays, Harris maintained he couldn‚Äôt tell if there was an edge, telling cricket.com.au, ‚ÄúIf they reviewed it and it showed I hit it and got caught, I would have gone, ‚ÄòYep, fair enough.‚Äô‚ÄùThe incident added fuel to the already intense contest, with Australia A holding a 1-0 lead in the series after winning the first match.

CHENNAI: Tamil Nadu needed to win by more than 40 goals in the senior nationals men‚Äôs hockey championship to qualify for the quarterfinals from Group C. Even they didn‚Äôt believe they could do it, but by the end of the day, they did beat Andaman and Nicobar Islands 43-0 at the Mayor Radhakrishnan Stadium here on Thursday to make the last-eight stage. Captain Selvam Karthi top scored for TN by scoring 13 goals with BP Somanna and Sundarapandi finding the back of the net nine times each.Competing in the nationals for the first time since 2019, Andaman didn‚Äôt look a team that should be part of a tournament of this stature. ""We do not have an astro-turf and due to bad climate (frequent rain), we mostly cannot train in grass ground. All the players in the team are between the age of 18 to 24 and are from poor background. The players stay in different islands and to get them together is difficult. They have the craze to play hockey and if they have the right infrastructure, probably they will get better,"" coach Sahu Surju, who is a hockey player and is pursuing a master‚Äôs degree in physical education, said.Andaman & Nicobar lost by huge margins (0-29 to Madhya Pradesh, 0-13 to Andhra Pradesh and now 0-43 to TN) in all the three matches that they played. When asked how the players feel mentally losing badly, the coach said: ""They are still maturing as they are very young. Many do not have exposure. We had requested Hockey India (HI) to lay an astro-turf earlier and from now, we will push hard to get proper facilities.""Apart from Andaman and Nicobar, many teams in the ongoing Nationals have lost their respective matches by huge margins. There is a marked difference in the skill set of the players. So, could bringing in zonal or division format raise the level of competition?""I think the teams that play in the Nationals should be good. You are basically humiliating the state that has conceded more goals. Probably they can play in the zonal format and the top teams can qualify for the nationals,"" Madhya Pradesh manager and former India coach Mir Ranjan Negi said.Meanwhile, Telangana coach Kiran Prasad added: ""This is the time (in Nationals) players compete with the top teams and by bringing in zonals or divisions, they could miss on playing against the best players in the country. Players might not get government jobs if they fail to qualify for the nationals from the zonal or division formats.""",Tamil Nadu beat Andaman and Nicobar Islands 43-0 to make last-eight stage.

The writing on the wall was clear on Day 2 itself. And the Day 3 proceedings unfolded on the expected lines as Jharkhand conceded the first-innings lead to Saurashtra in their Ranji Trophy match of Elite Group D at JSCA International Stadium in Ranchi on Friday.Resuming on 201/4, Saurashtra batters Harvik Desai and Arpit Vasavada proceeded from their overnight position on Day 2 to amass 386, establishing a substantial 80-run first-innings lead. Both exhibited measured batting whilst Jharkhand bowlers toiled hard from the outset.Having conceded the first-innings lead, Jharkhand progressed to 74/1 from 20 overs in their second innings, trailing Saurashtra by 6 runs going into the final day of the four-day game.Earlier, Desai achieved his seventh first-class century whilst seasoned campaigner Vasavada registered his 28th half-century as the pair constructed a 199-run partnership for the fifth wicket to bolster Saurashtra‚Äôs robust response.Vasavada (73 off 169 balls, 7 fours) departed on the final delivery before lunch with the scoreboard displaying 314/5. Desai followed shortly after lunch, crafting 155 off 263 deliveries, studded with 23 fours.Excluding Prerak Mankad‚Äôs 56-ball 40, the remaining lower middle order batters failed to produce noteworthy contributions as Saurashtra surrendered their final three wickets without adding runs, culminating at 386.Jharkhand left-arm spinner Manishi claimed 3/75 whilst his senior spin colleague Anukul Roy secured 2/33. Medium pacers Vikas Kumar took 3/74, including Vasavada‚Äôs wicket, whilst Vivekanand Tiwari acquired 2/80.Openers Nazim Siddiquie (32) and Saharandeep Singh (26 batting) provided the hosts with a solid foundation until the former was run out towards the day‚Äôs end. Sharandeep and Utkarsh Singh (10 batting) remain unbeaten at the crease.Much will depend on the home side batters as Jharkhand look to thwart any push by the former champions for an outright win on the last day. As for Saurashtra, they can give their faltering season a timely boost if they manage to eke out a remarkable win here.

The Bihar batters put up a show of grit in their bid to outperform Madhya Pradesh‚Äôs mammoth first innings total. But their fightback looks headed towards being futile as with 331 on board at stumps on Day 3 of their Elite Group C Ranji Trophy match in Patna on Friday, they were still trailing by 285 runs and with two wickets in hand.Earlier, on Thursday, Madhya Pradesh had managed to put up a huge score on Day 2 and ended their first innings on 616 while riding a match-influencing double century by skipper Shubham Sharma . Sharma led from the front with a strike rate of 83.04 as Venkatesh Iyer missed his double by a small margin and was leg before to Himangshu Sharma (5-196), the most impressive of the Bihar bowlers, follwed by Sachin Kumar (4-211).However, coming back to the filed on Friday on an overnight score of 131/4, Bipin Saurabh (71) and Ayush Loharuka (76) took up the challenge with perseverance. They added 96 runs off 186 balls for the fifth wicket and when Saurabh ws stumped by Himanshu Mantri off a Saransh Jain delivery, Bihar had crossed the 200 mark.The onus was shifted to Sharam Nigrodh (42) to join Loharuka in the middle and keep his team on course for the huge task ahead. Nigrodh and Loharuka then added another 86 runs with their sixth-wicket partnership as the visiting Madhya Pradesh bowlers made them work for every run.Bihar No. 8 batter, Sachin Kumar, too, played his part with a useful 34 runs to the hosts‚Äô total.But Bihar lacked an incredible knock ‚Äî like that of Sharma and Iyer on Day 2 ‚Äî as none from the home team could breach the three-figure mark with their bats and were on 331/8 when play was called off for the day.Jain, meanwhile, was the most successful among the visiting bowlers on Friday with his figures of 3-107 as Aryan Pandey and Kumar Kartikeya picked two wickets each to keep Madhya Paradesh on the path to first-innings lead and three points.Brief scores (in Patna):616.331/8 in 130.5 overs (Ayush Loharuka 76, Bipin Saurabh 71, Sharman Nigrodh 42; Saransh Jain 3/107).",Bihar batters put up a show of grit in their bid to outperform Madhya Pradesh‚Äôs mammoth first innings total.

Varun dismissed both Miller and Klaasen in a single over, heavily tilting the game in India's favor.The twin-breakthrough then allowed Ravi Bishnoi to capitalize from the other end as he claimed a three-for, dismantling South Africa's batting lineup.""I wanted to pick crucial wickets at the time, and it was important to get them (Klaasen and Miller) out.

Brief scores (In Guwahati):

Collectively not up to the mark till the last game, Assam batters fired in unison ‚Äì that, too, against the heavyweights Tamil Nadu ‚Äì to secure the crucial first-innings lead in a Ranji Trophy match in Guwahati on Friday.In an enthralling Elite Group D encounter at Barsapara Cricket Stadium, resuming their innings on 176/3, Assam showcased a remarkable batting display on the penultimate day to post a formidable total of 445 from 146.2 overs, thereby overtaking Tamil Nadu‚Äôs first-innings score of 338. This effort handed Assam a crucial lead of 107 runs, securing three vital points from the game.The highlights of the day were Assam captain Denish Das, who led his team from the front, and veteran Swarupam Purakayastha‚Äôs performance with the bat.Completing his century on the morning of Day 3, Das was a spectacle, scoring 109 off 195 balls, including 14 boundaries, before losing his stumps to the right-arm off-spinner Mohamed Ali. His partnership with Sibsankar Roy, who played the anchor‚Äôs role with a patient 69 off 208 balls, was particularly noteworthy.Their overnight unbeaten partnership fetched 173 runs for the fourth wicket, laying the foundation for Assam‚Äôs commanding first-innings reply. Despite a minor hiccup when keeper-batter Sumit Ghadigaonkar failed to convert his start, returning on 20, Assam lower-middle order showed resilience.Purakayastha, coming in at No. 7, found an able partner in Mukhtar Hussain at No. 8.

The exact circumstances that led to the violence remain unclear.The attacks were condemned by Dutch and Israeli leaders as antisemitic acts.Videos circulated showing Israeli fans chanting anti-Arab slogans in the streets before the game, which may have contributed to the tensions.Peter Holla, the acting police chief of Amsterdam, stated that the Israeli fans were ""willfully attacked"" by individuals on scooters, making it difficult for law enforcement to apprehend the perpetrators.In response, Israel initially ordered two planes to bring the fans back home but later decided to assist them in arranging commercial flights. The Israeli foreign minister also travelled urgently to the Netherlands.The incident has raised concerns about security measures for matches involving Israeli teams, as global tensions related to conflicts in the Middle East have overshadowed such events in multiple countries over the past year.Dutch authorities have pledged to increase police patrols in Amsterdam and enhance security at Jewish institutions in the city, which has a significant Jewish community and historical significance.Both Dutch and Israeli officials have condemned the violence and called for swift action against those responsible.","Violent incidents occurred following a Europa League match between Ajax and Maccabi Tel Aviv in Amsterdam.

BENGALURU: Bengaluru FC have been the standout team in the Indian Super League this season. If their attack found goals at crucial junctures, their defence has been right up there, conceding just four goals to help them stay at the top of the table with 16 points. Even though the Blues suffered a 0-3 loss to FC Goa on Saturday, they are upbeat about their next fixture against an in-form NorthEast United FC at the Sree Kanteerava Stadium here on Friday.In fact, their defence has not been breached even once (in four matches) at home with senior players Rahul Bheke and goalkeeper Gurpreet Singh Sandhu , who is one away from collecting a record 50 clean sheets in the competition, bringing their experience into play. The duo will have to be on their toes against a team, which is not short on confidence either.The Highlanders have scored 17 goals -- highest in the league this season. Moroccan forward Alaaeddine Ajaraie has contributed nine of those, including two each in their last two matches against Odisha FC and Jamshedpur FC. NorthEast, who have scored ten goals in their last three matches, have scored at least once in all their seven games, showcasing their attacking prowess.No wonder, Bengaluru head coach Gerard Zaragoza has billed the contest as BFC defence vs NorthEast attack. ‚ÄúOf course, we have a plan (against their strikers). They have strikers who score every game. But also, we need to remember that we are the team with more clean sheets. We have the best defensive team in the league. And I think it will be a nice game to see one with very good attack against one with very good defence.‚ÄùThe Blues' defence cannot alone win games, players up front have to be clinical in front of goal. Bengaluru attackers, including Sunil Chhetri , Edgar Mendez and others must come to the Fortress with their scoring boots on and they will be even more determined after drawing a blank against Goa. If they get back to their winning ways, Bengaluru can strengthen their position at the top and increase their lead to six points. Likewise, three points for Highlanders will rocket them to second spot. With big points at stake for both teams, a close contest is on the cards.","Bengaluru FC face an in-form NorthEast United FC at the Sree Kanteerava Stadium.

Al Ain have parted ways with head coach Hernan Crespo , just six months after celebrating an AFC Champions League title . The decision follows a string of disappointing results, culminating in a heavy 5-1 defeat to Cristiano Ronaldo 's Al Nassr in the Asian Champions League group stage.‚ÄúRecent results have not been up to expectations,‚Äù explained the club in an official statement released on Wednesday.Al Ain confirmed that a replacement for Crespo will be announced soon.Crespo, a former Argentine international striker known for his time at clubs like Chelsea and Inter Milan, joined Al Ain in November 2022. He quickly made an impact, leading the team to victory in the AFC Champions League this past May after defeating Japan's Yokohama F. Marinos in the final.However, the team's form dipped significantly starting in late September, with the loss to Al Nassr proving to be the final straw for Crespo's tenure. Ronaldo himself was among the scorers in the lopsided match, a result that leaves the defending champions at the bottom of their group with a single point from four matches.Al Ain's domestic campaign in the UAE Pro League has also been challenging. They currently sit in eighth place in the 14-team league, having earned just eight points from five matches.

Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz are set to further their emerging rivalry when the ATP Finals commence on Sunday, marking the first time in 23 years that the event will be held without any of the Big Three.Sinner, the top-ranked player, and No. 3 Alcaraz each claimed two Grand Slam titles this year, so a matchup between them in Turin would be fitting.In the draw on Thursday , Sinner and Alcaraz were placed in separate groups. Sinner will compete in the Ilie Nastase Group alongside Daniil Medvedev, Taylor Fritz, and Alex de Minaur, while Alcaraz will be in the John Newcombe Group with Alexander Zverev, Casper Ruud, and Andrey Rublev. The top two players from each group will advance to the semifinals following the round-robin stage.After withdrawing from last week's Paris Masters due to illness, Sinner arrived in Turin early to prepare. ‚ÄúFor me, this is the main event of the end of the year,‚Äù he stated.Notably absent is defending champion Novak Djokovic, who withdrew on Tuesday due to an unspecified injury . This is the first year since 2001 that the finals will occur without at least one of Djokovic, Roger Federer, or Rafael Nadal. Additionally, this season also marks the first time since 2002 that no member of that trio has won a Grand Slam title.Djokovic holds the record for the most ATP Finals victories, having won seven times and defeating Sinner in the final last year. Federer, who retired in 2022, won the event six times, while Nadal, who will retire after the Davis Cup next week, was a finalist twice but never secured a title.‚ÄúIt‚Äôs strange not to see Novak here, given all his success,‚Äù Zverev remarked. ‚ÄúWhen I won in 2018, you needed to defeat at least two of the top three players. It feels different now. But with Jannik and Carlos emerging, the focus has shifted to new talent. You have to overcome them to win big tournaments. They've both won two Grand Slams this year and undoubtedly rank among the best players in the world.‚ÄùAs the sole Italian in the competition, Sinner will attract significant attention, particularly since this is his first home appearance following the announcement of positive drug tests earlier this year before his US Open title.The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) appealed a decision exonerating Sinner, and the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) is expected to issue a ruling early next year. Sinner expressed uncertainty over updates, emphasising his positive outlook despite the challenging circumstance.Alcaraz has defeated Sinner in all three of their official meetings this year and currently leads their overall head-to-head 6-4.Sinner's year started with an Australian Open victory ‚Äî the first Grand Slam title for an Italian man since Adriano Panatta's 1976 French Open win. Alcaraz subsequently secured the French Open and Wimbledon titles, bringing his career total to four Grand Slams. Sinner later triumphed at the US Open. Notably, Sinner defeated Alcaraz during the Six Kings Slam exhibition in Saudi Arabia last month.Zverev, who has previously won the finals in London in 2018 and in Turin in 2021, seeks to claim his third title. Medvedev, the only other player in the field with a finals win, lifted the trophy in 2020.Zverev arrives in promising form following a title victory at the Paris Masters , which propelled him past Alcaraz to No. 2 in the rankings.Fritz aims to build on his maiden Grand Slam final appearance in New York, Ruud was a finalist in 2022, De Minaur is making his debut in the tournament, and Rublev is competing for the fifth consecutive year.The ATP Finals, featuring the top eight singles players and doubles teams, begins on November 10 and runs until November 17.The ATP Finals will be contested in Turin, Italy for the fourth consecutive year. The event will take place at the Inalpi Arena.Ilie Nastase Group: Jannik Sinner (1), Daniil Medvedev (4), Taylor Fritz (5), Alex de Minaur (7)John Newcombe Group: Alexander Zverev (2), Carlos Alcaraz (3), Casper Ruud (6), Andrey Rublev (8)Bob Bryan Group: Marcelo Arevalo and Mate Pavic (1), Simone Bolelli and Andrea Vavassori (4), Rohan Bopanna and Matthew Ebden (6), Kevin Krawietz and Tim Puetz (8)zverevMike Bryan Group: Marcel Granollers and Horacio Zeballos (2), Wesley Koolhof and Nikola Mektic (3), Max Purcell and Jordan Thompson (5), Harri Heliovaara and Henry Patten (7)The champion of the ATP Finals will receive $4.8 million, the largest prize in men‚Äôs tennis history.

Riyadh:

Defending WTA Finals champion Iga Swiatek was eliminated from the season-ending championship on Thursday after Barbora Krejcikova's 7-5 6-4 win over Coco Gauff meant the Polish world number two failed to advance to the last four.Gauff was already guaranteed to make the semis, but five-times Grand Slam champion Swiatek needed the American to beat eighth-seeded Czech Krejcikova who required a victory herself to progress.The 13th-ranked Krejcikova took a tight first set, which lasted 54 minutes, after saving four break points, wrapping it up with a powerful backhand that zipped down the line.Former US Open champion Gauff, who had not dropped a set in the tournament before the contest, was hurt by unforced errors ‚Äî 23 alone in the opener.The second set was once again a close affair, but the Wimbledon champion held her nerve to secure the win in one hour and 42 minutes.""This is a big win for me and really happy with how I played and it was a really good match,"" the 27-year-old Krejcikova said. ""It's tough, it was up and down. The Wimbledon victory is the highest point in my career so far.""Being here and reaching the semi-final, it's something unimaginable. I'm really proud of myself and I'm looking forward to the new challenges.""Krejcikova is the lowest-ranked player to book a spot in the semis at the WTA Finals since Sandrine Testud (14) in 2001.Gauff will face world number one Aryna Sabalenka in a blockbuster semi-final, while Krejcikova will take on China's Olympic champion Zheng Qinwen .Earlier Swiatek had produced a ruthless performance to dismantle Daria Kasatkina 6-1 6-0, wasting little time in asserting herself as she raced to a 5-0 lead in the opening set which she wrapped up with an ace.Having replaced Jessica Pegula after the American withdrew due to a left knee injury, world number nine Kasatkina was demolished in the second set as Swiatek sealed the win in 51 minutes, making it the fastest match at the WTA Finals in eight years.Swiatek won 72% of her points on serve and thumped 15 winners as she extended her head-to-head advantage over the 27-year-old Russian to 6-1.Kasatkina is not the first player to be steam-rollered at the WTA Finals by Swiatek, who took her tally of 6-0 set wins at the tournament to five.The 23-year-old Pole equalled Serena Williams' total of 6-0 set wins at the event and is now only behind greats Martina Navratilova (12), Chris Evert and Steffi Graf (both seven).",Defending WTA Finals champion Iga Swiatek is eliminated from the season-ending championship.

Coco Gauff posted a rare victory over Iga Swiatek to punch her ticket to the semi-finals of the WTA Finals in Riyadh on Tuesday, ensuring Aryna Sabalenka will finish the year as the world number one Swiatek, the defending champion, was in a direct battle with Sabalenka for the top spot this week but needed a win over Gauff to keep her chances alive of leapfrogging her Belarusian rival.Gauff, 20, entered the contest having lost 11 of her 12 previous meetings with Swiatek, with the American's sole victory coming in Cincinnati last year.But she turned the tables on Swiatek on Tuesday, defeating the second seed 6-3, 6-4 to make it two straight-sets wins from two round-robin matches in Riyadh this week.""It feels great. I knew going into the match that despite our head-to-head I had a lot of confidence going in,"" said Gauff, who hit 11 double faults during the one-hour 48-minute showdown.With the exception of the opening game of the match, Gauff had break point opportunities in every Swiatek service game in the first set.The American third seed made her move in game seven, breaking for 4-3, and she closed out the set with a second break of serve, taking the lead in 49 minutes.Swiatek needed six break points in a marathon third game of the second set to finally take down the Gauff serve but she couldn't consolidate her advantage.They traded breaks again, as Gauff's double-fault tally went up to double digits and Swiatek racked up the errors.It was Gauff who eventually steadied the ship, and wrapped up the victory on Swiatek's 47th unforced error of the match.Swiatek, a five-time major champion, admits her two-month break between the US Open and the WTA Finals and the fact she is playing her first tournament with her new coach Wim Fissette have made things ""a bit more tricky and different than usual"".""But I'll force myself to work even better in the next match,"" the Pole added.Earlier in the day, Barbora Krejcikova ended Jessica Pegula's chances of qualifying for the semi-finals, defeating the sixth-seeded American 6-3, 6-3.A runner-up at the WTA Finals last year, Pegula suffered her second straight-sets defeat of the week and enters her final round-robin match against Swiatek on Thursday anchoring the Orange Group with zero sets won.Eighth-seeded Krejcikova bounced back from her opening loss to Swiatek to keep her hopes of making the final four alive.""I was fighting for every ball and I felt that I really have to play my best tennis and I was trying to be really solid and trying to put as many balls to the other side as I could,"" said Krejcikova, who picked up just her 20th match win of the season.""I'm definitely proud.

I had amazing two Olympics and in the third one, I couldn't get a medal. But I think I played well. I learn from my mistakes and come back stronger. It's not just over with it. I am looking one year at a time and now the next Olympics is again four years down the line.""So the main aim and goal is to stay fit and stay motivated and be injury free. And enjoy what I do.""Sindhu stressed that she has no regrets despite her early exit in Paris, saying, ""It's not the end of the world.""""I can see myself going there for at least the next couple of years now. I don't hate it or anything, it's fine, I need to come out of it. I don't have any regrets, it's not just over for me. I definitely would want to play a lot more and why not?""Sindhu believes she still has potential to win more titles and continue inspiring the next generation of Indian athletes.""There's always more to strive for. I want to win more titles, stand on more podiums and of course, ultimately leave a legacy that inspires the next generation of Indian athletes,"" said the Commonwealth Games champion.""I'm committed to pushing my limits and making the most of every opportunity in my career. I want to win a lot more and I have it in me.""Sindhu has made several changes to her coaching staff in her quest to regain her glory. After winning bronze at Tokyo with South Korean coach Park Tae Sang , she worked with SAI coach Vidhi Chaudhary and All England champion Muhammad Hafiz Hashim before joining the Padukone-Dravid Badminton Academy (PPBA) with coach Agus Dwi Santoso to prepare for the Paris Games.After her Paris exit, she brought in Anup Sridhar and former World No. 5 Lee Hyun-il for the rest of the season.""Sometimes, when you need a change, you need a change. I have had good coaches, good support system. I wanted some change after Park. Then I had a couple of them and I think right now it's Lee and Anup.""You need to do what is best for you.""Sindhu is now focussing on the next events in Japan and China.""I'm in good shape, physically and mentally I'm fit. We've been working on different aspects, on speed and defence. It's always good to learn new things from different coaches, which will help in your game.""So it's going on really well and I hope, you know, this time in Japan and China, I hope I do well with their guidance. So, just that you'll have to just wait for the magic to start.""In addition to her on-court commitments, Sindhu has also launched the 'PV Sindhu Centre for Badminton and Sports Excellence' in Visakhapatnam.""I bought this land before, the academy will take one and a half years to complete. The vision is to inspire and nurture the next generation of champions. We aim to create a world-class specialty for young athletes, regardless of their backgrounds.""","Two-time Olympic medallist says if she remains injury-free and in peak physical condition, she will aim for a third medal. Sindhu won silver at the 2016 Rio Olympics and bronze at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.

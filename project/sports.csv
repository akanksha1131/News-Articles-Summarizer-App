T20 World Cup: India humiliate Pakistan again

NEW DELHI: Pakistan’s heavy 61-run loss to India has put their T20 World Cup campaign in danger, and they could be knocked out depending on the upcoming results in Group A.India have already qualified for the Super Eights with three wins from three matches, while Pakistan sit third with two wins and one loss.The USA’s win over Namibia has further tightened the race, making the final group matches crucial for Pakistan’s survival in the tournament. At this moment, USA and Pakistan have the same number of points (4). However, thanks to having a better net run rate, USA find themselves at the second position on the points table.Pakistan head coach Mike Hesson admitted the defeat was hard on the players, saying, ""There's a pretty disappointed dressing room in there at the moment, because they know how much it means to Pakistan.""He added that despite recent winning form, India were simply better on the day.""We know that it's a huge event, Pakistan against India. We obviously won five games on the bounce before today so we were confident, but today we got outplayed,"" he added.India posted 175-7 thanks to Ishan Kishan’s 77, with support from Suryakumar Yadav and Shivam Dube.Pakistan collapsed early to 13-3 and were bowled out for 114, with Usman Khan top-scoring with 44.Hesson defended the decision to bowl first, saying, ""I think the ball was spinning quite a lot initially and we started off well but I think the way Kishan played, he took the game away from us.""Now Pakistan must beat Namibia on Wednesday in their final group match to stay alive.If they lose, they will be eliminated. If the match is washed out by rain, both teams will share points, and Pakistan will qualify for the Super 8s.Their fate could also depend on other results, including USA and Netherlands matches, which could affect qualification standings.Hesson urged the team to recover quickly, saying, ""We have to pick ourselves up and make sure that we're very good in two or three days.""He added confidence remains, stating, ""We have played some good cricket in the lead-up to this World Cup, so we're confident to do well in the tournament.""","Pakistan's T20 World Cup campaign in danger after 61-run loss to India.

COLOMBO: The Indo-Pak relations on the field, in front of cameras, stayed where it had to stay. No handshakes.In Colombo on Sunday, there wasn't the animosity that led up to the Asia Cup final last September. No one was taking pot-shots at each other, and television analysts from India were interviewing Pakistani players. But once it came to the toss, Salman Ali Agha and Surya Kumar Yadav handcuffed themselves from doing the most natural thing that they did all their lives - shaking hands with the opposition captain.Agha said on Saturday that he wants cricket to be played in the spirit that it always was. Surya didn't rule out the handshake either, but the ice couldn't melt.But if you kept an eye on the proceedings before the game, you could see that people around the sport were ready to move on from the off-field animosities that made the cricket world toxic.Usman Tariq, the slinger mystery spinner of Pakistan, was doing warm-ups, and Harbhajan Singh , one of the staunchest critics of his action, was standing close by. Tariq didn't care for whatever was said in the lead-up to the game. He did a 'salaam' to the senior practitioner of his art, and the Indian great reciprocated.It wasn't just that. Harbhajan interviewed Sahibzada Farhan, who was India's enemy No 1 in Dubai a few months ago, and it all looked pretty cordial. But the frame of the day was when the off-spinner had a long conversation with Misbah ul Haq.One couldn't help going back to the 2007 T20 final, when Misbah took on Bhajji and almost single-handedly turned the game. With Misbah still there, the Indian offie chose not to bowl the last over, and Joginder Sharma won the match for India. We don't know if that was discussed, but you could see the friendly vibes of the two greats.Not too far away from the cricket action, Shabana Azmi, one of India's greatest actresses, was speaking at the Ceylon Literary & Arts Festival. Recently, she was seen in a meaty role in a cricket-related film, Ghoomer, and when TOI asked her how she feels about all that is happening in the sport, Azmi said: ""We keep forgetting that cricketers from both sides of the border are friends with each other, and it's important that sports and arts should transcend national boundaries,"" adding that it should act as an ""adhesive"" between the 2 nations.It drew quite a round of applause from the small gathering. And once you left the confines of the little auditorium and walked towards the massive Premadasa, you could see Indian and Pakistani fans getting their faces painted by the same artist. Of course, the Indians outnumbered the Pakistanis, but there wasn't an iota of animosity. During Pakistan's reply, at the fall of their sixth wicket in the 12th over, fans in green began exiting the ground.An Indian fan playfully told them, ""You are leaving?"" One Pakistanis replied, ""We all have to leave at some point,"" and then they shook hands.Probably there's not much on the field either beyond the desperate desire to win a game of cricket. But then, that's not for public consumption.","No handshakes at the toss between captains, but for India-Pakistan greats, fans at Premadasa, it was just cricket.

T20 World Cup | Jonathan Trott press conference after loss vs South Africa

NEW DELHI: Heartbreak in cricket can linger, replaying in fragments long after the game is over. For Afghanistan, the double Super Over defeat to South Africa in Ahmedabad has been one such moment. A match that slipped from their grasp more than once and now threatens to derail their T20 World Cup campaign. Skipper Rashid Khan , on Sunday, admitted that the pain is still raw but insisted the team must channel the disappointment into renewed resolve.Afghanistan had opportunities to close out the contest within the regulation 20 overs and again in the first Super Over, only for the match to stretch into a second eliminator where South Africa eventually prevailed. The narrow defeat came after a five-wicket loss to New Zealand in their opening match.“It is quite heartbreaking. Last one and a half years, we worked very hard... keeping our hopes of going deep in the T20 World Cup in mind, but sometimes it doesn’t go your way. The most important thing is the mindset we played with and the effort we put during our first two games,” Rashid said, acknowledging the emotional toll of the result.For a side that has steadily risen in world cricket, the loss felt particularly cruel. Yet Rashid believes the experience, however painful, could serve a greater purpose. “It’s going to help us. It’s not only the upcoming games, but the upcoming cricket we have. So, there are lots of positives we can take from those two games,” he said.The lingering sting of near misses is not unfamiliar territory for Afghanistan. Rashid drew parallels with their agonising defeat to Australia in the 2023 ODI World Cup, when they had reduced the opposition to 91 for 7 before Glenn Maxwell’s blistering double century turned the match on its head. That memory, Rashid said, stayed with the team until they exacted revenge at the 2024 T20 World Cup.“It’s very hard to lose a game that we have in our hands, like a couple of times, and then it just slips out of your hand. It doesn’t go away from your mind. Like, the game we played against Australia in 2023 ODI World Cup, it never goes out of the mind, until we won against them in the 2024 T20 World Cup,” Rashid said.Beyond the immediate disappointment, Rashid pointed to a broader challenge confronting Afghanistan, and that’s lack of regular exposure against top-tier opposition. According to him, limited bilateral opportunities against leading teams make World Cup encounters “disproportionately demanding”.“As a team, if you don’t get a chance to play against a big team regularly, that’s what happens. If we played more T20s against South Africa, New Zealand, we would have had an idea of where this team can beat us and where we can do better. You just play them once a year, and that too at a World Cup event. It is such a time and occasion where you have no choice of making a mistake,” he said.Also scheduling realities often leave teams like Afghanistan with little margin for error.“If you play two matches in four days against New Zealand and South Africa, then your World Cup can end in four. We lost both the matches in four days; we are out of the World Cup mostly. So, this pressure is different. If you make a small mistake, you’re out of the competition,” Rashid said.Greater exposure, he believes, would help Afghanistan better understand and counter the strategies of elite teams. “If you play with them, you’ll get an idea. If you don’t play, then they’ll come with new planning every time... like we saw with New Zealand, they came with aggressive mindset.”",Afghanistan lost double Super Over to South Africa in T20 World Cup.

T20 World Cup | Jonathan Trott press conference after loss vs South Africa

NEW DELHI: A defeat can bruise a team. A loss following a double Super Over can hollow it out. Afghanistan now face the tough task of picking themselves up mentally after their heartbreaking defeat to South Africa in Ahmedabad, as they take on UAE in a must-win T20 World Cup Group D clash here on Monday. Two losses in as many games have left Afghanistan’s hopes hanging by a thread. Even if they are favourites to win their remaining fixtures against UAE and Canada, their fate is no longer entirely in their own hands. A New Zealand victory over Canada the following day would seal Afghanistan’s exit.This precarious position sits in contrast to the strides Afghanistan have made in recent years. A semifinal appearance in the 2024 edition of the T20 World Cup and a spirited showing in the ODI World cup in 2023, underlined their rise.Rashid Khan remains the sport’s premier T20 spinner, Mujeeb Ur Rahman brings mystery to the fold, Azmatullah Omarzai is a genuine all-round force, Ibrahim Zadran offers them the steadiness with the bat. Zadran’s opening partner Rahmanullah Gurbaz can turn games single-handedly, and old warhorse Mohammad Nabi is still up for a joust.On paper, it is a line-up capable of challenging any side. Experts tipped them to make the Super Eights at least, if not go deeper. However, they are yet to bring their A-game to this tournament. Afghanistan will particularly look towards Zadran to rediscover form. Often the perfect foil to the attacking Gurbaz, Zadran’s role as an anchor assumes added significance in the high-pressure environment of a World Cup, where stability can be as valuable as aggression.While the conventional anchor’s role in T20 cricket may be fading, Zadran has shown signs of evolving with the format. Yet this campaign has brought modest returns — 22 runs from two innings — and Afghanistan will expect a stronger showing at the top.History, though, offers Afghanistan comfort. They hold an 11-3 win-loss record over UAE.By contrast, UAE will go into the match with renewed confidence after their win over Canada, achieved at the same Arun Jaitley Stadium that will host their remaining group games. Familiarity with conditions could prove to be an advantage, but their path to qualification is far more complicated. They too depend on Canada upsetting New Zealand and script victories over both Afghanistan and South Africa on Wednesday. Even that may not suffice unless they significantly improve their net run-rate, which currently trails New Zealand’s by a considerable margin.Their hopes would hinge on the swashbuckling Sohaib Khan. Born in Gaya, Bihar, and educated at the Jamia Millia Islamia university in Delhi, the UAE batter showcased his destructive ability against Canada with a 29-ball 51 that shifted the game’s momentum. UAE will look to him once again for inspiration.",Afghanistan take on UAE in a must-win T20 World Cup Group D clash on Monday.

T20 World Cup: India humiliate Pakistan again

NEW DELHI: Pakistan captain Salman Ali Agha on Sunday shared his thoughts on the defeat to India and admitted his team did not perform well.He said the team trusted their spinners, but they had a bad day and failed to execute their plans properly. He explained that losing early wickets in T20 cricket makes it very hard to recover.""We were believing in our spinners, and they had an off day today. Execution was missing in some parts of the game. We were obviously always going to believe our spinners, because they've done really well in the last six months. And with the batting, I think we didn't start well, and in T20 games, if we lose 3 or 4 wickets in the powerplay, you are always chasing the game,"" Agha said in the post-match presentation.Agha also explained why Pakistan chose to bowl first. He said the pitch was difficult early on, with the ball gripping, but it became better for batting later. He admitted the bowlers did not adjust to the situation, and the batters did not play long enough to take the game deep.Talking about pressure in big matches, he added, ""In these kinds of games, the emotions are always going to be high. We just need to deal with that because we have played enough cricket and we have played enough games like that.So, it's just we need to gather ourselves very quickly, and we have a game in two days' time, and we need to look forward to that as well.""Looking ahead to the rest of the tournament, he stressed staying positive and focusing on the bigger goal, saying, ""Yeah, obviously, you have to see the bigger picture. We have a game in two days' time. We need to win that game and qualify for the Super Eights and then it's a new tournament start again.""On the field, India dominated. Ishan Kishan scored 77 to help India reach 175/7. Then India’s bowlers bowled Pakistan out for 114, giving India a 61-run win.India are now top of Group A, while Pakistan sit third with two wins and one loss.

Dance, drums and fun! Team India land in Colombo | Hardik Pandya with Mahieka Sharmaindia arrival-

Kolkata: Some wobbles, some worries and in the end Mohun Bagan Super Giant got just what the doctor ordered — a 2-0 win over Kerala Blasters to start their defence of the ISL title here on Saturday.Jamie Maclaren put Sergio Lobera’s side in front in the 36th minute and Tom Aldred came off the bench to head home the second goal to polish the victory up deep into injury time.However, it was not the kind of rise-and-shine moment the 30,000-odd fans present at the stands would love to be thrilled with.The defending champions’ path to victory was strewn with some avoidable potholes here and there, something which one might be tempted to attribute to their opening match rustiness and ineptitude.It was Petratos who had a direct role in breaking the deadlock. The Bagan No. 9, receiving the ball inside the box from Apuia, laid it off quickly for fellow Australian Maclaren, who steered clear of Aiban Dohling’s challenge with a sharp turn to beat the goalkeeper Sachin Suresh with a left-footed low volley. Bagan thereafter had more possession and more territory, but they couldn’t control the opponents, who looked more ambitious in the second half, especially with the arrival of Kevin Yoke.Sensing the problem, Lobera introduced Aldred in the 81st minute, taking off Petratos. Defender Aldred calmed the nerves for his team, rising to the occasion to meet Anirush Thapa’s free-kick and beating the Blasters goalkeeper for the second time. It also ensured a perfect start to the Lobera reign at the club as the Spaniard has now kept the record of a winning debut in the ISL for all four clubs he has managed so far.",Mohun Bagan Super Giant beat Kerala Blasters 2-0 in ISL opener.

KOLKATA: Defending champions Mohun Bagan Super Giant started Indian Super League 2025-26 with a comfortable 2-0 victory over Kerala Blasters FC in the season opener here at the Vivekananda Yuba Bharathi Krirangan (VYBK).A first-half strike from Jamie Maclaren (36') and a second-half injury-time goal from Tom Aldred (90+6') secured three points for the Mariners.Mohun Bagan SG head coach Sergio Lobera named a very strong lineup with all the familiar faces including Dimi Petratos, Jamie Maclaren and Alberto Rodriguez, taking the field for the Spaniard's first match in charge of the Mariners. New signings Mehtab Singh, Robson Da Silva, and Amey Ranawade were the fresh faces in the whole match day squad. On the other hand, David Catala named a young lineup in his first ISL match, with foreign signings Oumar Ba and Victor Bertomeu making their debuts alongside midfielders Y Ebindas and Rowllin Borges, as per an ISL press release.The defending champions had the better possession in the first half, with Anirudh Thapa and Lalengmawia Ralte (Apuia) controlling the midfield, allowing Robson and Liston Colaco to find space to attack through the wings.Dimi Petratos returned to his preferred No. 10 role behind Jamie Maclaren, and the Australian almost gave his side an early lead. Liston Colaco found Petratos inside the box, but the forward snatched his shot, which went wide of the goal.The Mariners were dominating possession, but were finding it difficult to break down the stubborn defence of Kerala Blasters. They did manage to take the lead after the water break through Jamie Maclaren. He was found inside the box by Petratos, and the Aussie striker turned Aiban Dohling and found the net through a composed left-footed finish for the first goal of the ISL season. Mohun Bagan ended the first half with the one goal lead registering ten shots on goal with six on target at the end of the half.Catala made two changes in the start of the second half, bringing in Naocha Singh and Marlon Trujillo while Subhasish Bose was replaced by Amey Ranawade for Mohun Bagan. The second half also saw the Mariners being comfortable with the ball, maintaining possession for long periods to force the Blasters to defend deep in their own half.Kerala Blasters became stronger in the final quarter of the game, especially with the introduction of Kevin Yoke, who showed his pace and dribbling abilities down the wings, but could not muster any clear-cut chances to trouble Vishal Kaith in goal. Mohun Bagan put the game beyond the reach of the opposition in injury-time of the second half with substitute Tom Aldred finding the goal with a powerful header past Sachin Suresh from the free-kick of Anirudh Thapa.Jamie Maclaren was named Player of the Match.",Defending champions Mohun Bagan Super Giant started Indian Super League 2025-26 with a comfortable 2-0 victory over Kerala Blasters FC.

Hours before the truncated Indian Super League (ISL) season gets underway on Saturday, it became official that FanCode had sub-licensed the linear TV rights to Sony Pictures Network India (SPNI). Under the agreement, as reported by TimesofIndia.com , Sony Sports Network will hold exclusive TV broadcast rights for India and non-exclusive rights for Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Maldives, Nepal, and Sri Lanka. The position on international broadcast, however, is still in the works.All 91-matches will be telecast on Sony Ten 2 and pushed to other channels too if there is a double header at the same time.This is not the first time Sony Sports Network and FanCode will work together. Both platforms carried tennis' French Open in 2025 with Sony retaining the primary broadcast and sub-licensing the streaming aspect of all courts to Dream Sports-owned FanCode.Last year, a similar ploy was employed between Sony Sports and JioHotstar for cricket's India tour of England. Under those terms, Sony kept the television broadcast rights while JioHotstar was responsible for the digital streaming.""The macro observation on this is (that) there's so much opportunity (in the sports industry). (It) is so large that honestly there's just so much to be done in the industry that collaboration is probably more apt at this moment than competition because there's so much opportunity,"" explained FanCode co-founder Yannick Colaco of the sub-licensing strategy""And the way we look at it is very clear. We are a digital-first platform. So the two things that are unique about Fancode is (that) we are digital first and we are sports only.""Our product, our approach has always been focused on technology, focused on experience, focused on how we are available across 11 operating systems, focused on innovation on the digital side. And we neither have, nor (a) desire, to have any focus on building a linear TV business.""So when you look at those two unique pieces, there is tremendous opportunity to collaborate with other large media companies, which have a much bigger mandate and ambit. Very politely, we are a much smaller player in this overall media landscape.""And I think that's the way we look at it in the sense that while younger audiences are all digital first, and even some of the older audiences are migrating to digital, there is still a large audience which consumes sports content on linear television.""So when we're working with partners like the AIFF (All India Football Federation) and the ISL, we're very conscious of the fact that to help the sport grow, help the event be successful, give it maximum amount of distribution, we need to be collaborating with partners who have the linear TV presence so that we are able to reach out and basically able to reach out to all sports fans and all ISL fans across the country,"" he continued.Less than two weeks ago, FanCode acquired the broadcast rights -- linear TV and digital -- for the ISL at Rs 8.62 crore. Even though the company has presence only in digital streaming space, it consciously bid for both aspects knowing there were few, if any, players interested in just the linear TV rights.During conversations between FanCode, AIFF and the ISL interim committee, the provider made it clear they wanted to help ensure the top-division football was showcased to as many viewers as possible.After officially bagging the rights, the company entered into conversations with multiple national providers and even some regional ones.""We immediately started speaking to a bunch of people about this, including regional broadcasters, and we took a bunch of proposals that we got, we put them all together. We shared them with the AIFF and the interim committee. We got on a call with them. I shared the pros and cons of each one with them. And on that basis, a decision was made to accept Sony's proposal,"" said Colaco.While that was happening, FanCode also spoke to ISL club representatives to understand their expectations on how to improve the product. It was at this stage that the concept of each club's 'superfan' recording visuals behind the scenes came into being.ISL will have commentary in English, Hindi, Malayalam, Bengali and Tamil (only for Chennaiyin matches).Doing all this, why give away market share to a competitor like Sony Sports?""I'm making it easier for people who prefer to watch the game on linear television to watch it. And yes, (if it comes) at the cost of us also, that's okay. I think it's important to think consumer first. So I believe that eventually our product is what will give users the choice and deliver a great experience. And if it's good enough, which I hope it is, and I believe it is, consumers will come,"" reasoned Colaco.""I don't think it should be forced and that's always what we (have) believed. And I also think that you know a partner like Sony will help in raising the promotion levels and contribute (to the) marketing. (As the saying goes) A rising tide lifts all boats,"" he added.On their part, Sony Sports Network, who had attended the pre-bid conference for the broadcast rights but chose not to make a final bid, sees this as an opportunity to add to their football portfolio which is largely led by European competitions.""While we were keen to add ISL to our sports portfolio, back then, we needed more time to evaluate the property before putting in our financial offer,"" said Rajesh Kaul, Chief Revenue Officer and Business Head - Sports and International, SPNI,Yet this won't be their first foray into Indian football having previously showcased the I-League and Durand Cup.""Our aim is to cater to football fans and expand the football ecosystem in India. Sony Pictures Networks India is the Home of Football in India and we have a diverse and expansive portfolio of both International and Indian football properties that includes UEFA EURO 2028, the UEFA Champions League, UEFA Europa League, UEFA Nations League, Bundesliga, FA Cup along with India’s very own legacy tournament Durand Cup. Last year, we were also the official broadcasters of I-League which is also homegrown football league,"" he stated.","FanCode sub-licensed the linear TV rights to Sony Pictures Network India. Sony Sports Network will hold exclusive TV broadcast rights for India and non- exclusive rights for Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Maldives, Nepal, and Sri Lanka. All 91-matches will be telecast on Sony Ten 2 and pushed to other channels too if there is a double header.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128338674,imgsize-56580,width-400,resizemode-4/fancode-sony.jpg"
India’s lost football season to kick off finally with Mohun Bagan hosting Kerala Blasters,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/top-stories/indias-lost-football-season-to-kick-off-finally-with-mohun-bagan-hosting-kerala-blasters/articleshow/128335751.cms,"AIFF

Jay Shah’s 2036 Olympic blueprint for India: '8 Medals won’t cut it'

Kolkata: The wait is over. The Indian football season is finally here but not, perhaps, at a time ideal enough to fall head over heels with it, especially after the way the game has been left gasping in search of clarity, continuity and identity. As Mohun Bagan SG begin their title defence of an abridged version of the Indian Super League against Kerala Blasters here on Saturday, Indian football is facing a strange transition.True, every transition has its own turbulence, but this season seems to be more about unshackling a state of sterility than setting in motion a long haul.Change, though, remains the popular catchword — both as a contradictory and complementary force. For the first time since the league’s inception in 2014, it’s now in the hands of the national federation.But in this change of guard, issues remain and unintended consequences threaten to emerge with the end of the Master Rights Agreement between the AIFF and Reliance-owned Football Sports Development Limited.How the entire ISL ecosystem has bled in this period of uncertainty is there for everyone to see, and shudder.Holders Mohun Bagan are beginning a new life replacing last season’s ISL Shield and Cup-winning coach Jose Molina with another successful and veteran Spaniard Sergio Lobera.“Pressure? Yes, there’s pressure. I think if you don’t feel pressure, it means you don’t need to fight for big targets. I know I am in a winning team, in a champion’s team. I know what is my responsibility and I am very excited about this responsibility,” Lobera remarked during his match-eve media interaction on Friday.Lobera has reasons to be optimistic as the might of Mohun Bagan looks too formidable to be rooted out easily. Because even in this period of chaos and uncertainty, they have the luxury of assembling the players and training for the past couple of months.Kerala Blasters, on the other hand, represent everything about the detrimental effect of this confusing and trying time. They had to part company with their entire force of foreigners including the veterans like Noah Sadoui, Jesus Jimenez and Adrian Luna and new coach David Catala has a job on his hands with the arrival of a new quintet of overseas players with no experience of playing in Indian conditions.‘We have come here with just 14 days of preparation and it’s not enough,” Catala said.“We’re up against a team which has been training all this time when we didn’t know what would happen to us. It is true that we are going to be the underdog team, but in football anything can happen,” the Blasters coach added.Constrained by financial instability, the state of play has seen several clubs go the Blasters’ way, with FC Goa’s David Timor, Iker Guarrotxena and Borja Herrera, Mumbai City FC’s Tiri and Bengaluru FC’s Edgar Mendez being some familiar faces bidding forced goodbyes to Indian football while Durand Cup champions North-East United FC have loaned out Alaeddine Ajaraie — the best player of the ISL’s 2024-2025 season — to Persija Jakarta in the Indonesian league.","Mohun Bagan SG begin their title defence of an abridged version of the Indian Super League against Kerala Blasters here on Saturday.

“Why don’t you write something positive?” said an irate Indian football official to this reporter. It was the plea of a frustrated representative who had done plenty at the grassroots level but was trying to please multiple stakeholders in the administrative chaos that is Indian football.Picture this. Only two days before the Indian Super League , the country’s top football division, was set to get underway on February 14, members of the All India Football Federation (AIFF) Executive Committee were voting on whether to keep it a 14-team league or expand it to 15 by including Churchill Brothers.That plea from Churchill Brothers was unanimously rejected, keeping Inter Kashi in the top division after a legal quagmire that remains unresolved. The league will therefore remain a 14-team competition with a single round-robin format, featuring 91 matches across the 2025–26 season.Yes, the 2025–26 season is finally getting underway in February 2026, five months later than originally planned. The February 14 start date was reached only after the intervention of the Sports Ministry, which wanted the delay to not affect the country’s ambitious bid to host the 2036 Olympics.All this transpired because Football Sports Development Limited (FSDL), the Reliance-backed company that launched and ran the ISL since 2014, saw its Master Rights Agreement (MRA) with the AIFF end in December 2025.The AIFF, stalled by court visits and constitutional updates, neither contemplated its options leading up to this deadline nor moved to renew the association.In the interim, uncertainty prevailed over if, or when, the season would get underway. While administrators twiddled their thumbs, foreign players departed to keep their careers going. Clubs were forced to let them go to recover some costs and to respect the players’ wishes.When the season finally received a start date, organisers struggled to get stadiums in playable condition. Odisha FC will only begin training for the new season on February 17 and, with no home venue confirmed, their opening fixture against Punjab FC on February 16 has been postponed. Kerala Blasters, who at one point considered shutting shop, had no clarity on which city they could feasibly play in.After extensive back-and-forth, the AIFF readied an interim fixture list, which was officially announced just a week before the league’s start. With FanCode on board as the digital broadcaster, the linear television announcement with Sony Sports Network will only take place on the day the season begins.Now for the positives amid the gloom. All stakeholders, including clubs, players, fans, sponsors and even the AIFF, deserve credit for ensuring the season was not lost. They showed maturity for the greater good.Most players have agreed to take pay cuts to keep the ball rolling, quite literally. The same applies to club owners and CEOs who have agreed to invest in a truncated season, aware that revenues will not match previous years, but have returned for the greater good.Even the AIFF, which has faced heavy criticism and could serve as a case study in administrative mismanagement, can argue that its hands were tied by legal disputes and warring factions. The fact that it eventually managed, through multiple mediators, to get everyone moving in the same direction is commendable.Unsurprisingly, the drama and court visits may not be over. As the AIFF circulated the League Rules on the eve of the season’s start, it made clear that relegation will be implemented as per the latest Constitution.This comes barely two weeks after clubs wrote to the Sports Ministry seeking Force Majeure for the season, effectively requesting a pause on relegation.Subsequently, the club that goes down could take the legal route later if the issue is not addressed for now.FC Goa, Mohun Bagan Super Giant, Odisha FC, East Bengal, Jamshedpur FC, SC Delhi, Punjab FC, Mumbai City FC, Bengaluru FC, Kerala Blasters, Inter Kashi, Mohammedan SC, NorthEast United, Chennaiyin FCMohun Bagan Super Giant vs Kerala Blasters on February 14 at 5 pmFC Goa vs Inter Kashi on February 14 at 7:30 pmRs 1.25 croreRs 75 lakhRs 2 croreFanCodeSony Sports Network","The ISL 2025-26 season will start on Saturday.

Chelsea F.C. progressed to the fifth round of the FA Cup after a 4-0 victory over Hull City A.F.C. at the MKM Stadium. Pedro Neto scored three goals, while Estevao Willian scored one.This was a return to Hull for Chelsea manager Liam Rosenior, who has played for and managed the club before. Hull City sacked him in 2024 after they failed to make the Championship play-offs.Despite the bitter end to his spell at Hull, the 41-year-old manager has stated that it is ""an amazing thing"" to be back in Humberside and that he took full advantage of the opportunity to prove to his former club what they had missed out on.""This club means a lot not just to me but also my family for many reasons,"" Rosenior said.""I do hope they make the Premier League this year, but because of our attitude and application, that is what gave us the platform to win tonight.""Rosenior has won eight of his first 11 matches since joining Chelsea from Strasbourg in January to replace Enzo Maresca. He made seven changes to the team for this match. Cole Palmer, Enzo Fernandez and Joao Pedro were not included.""Pedro Neto has been outstanding, he works so hard and has so much quality. I'm delighted to see him get the goals,"" Rosenior said.""The most pleasing aspect was the mentality. It was a really strong performance in terms of the mental application you need to be successful. Everyone worked really hard for each other.""Chelsea dominated possession in the first half and scored in the 40th minute. Liam Delap assisted Neto, who scored from outside the box.Andrey Santos had a header saved by Dillon Phillips in the early minutes of the second half. From the resulting corner, Neto’s cross was scored at the near post to make it 2-0 in the 51st minute.Chelsea had tied 2-2 with Leeds in their earlier match in the week when they were leading by two goals, but this time they maintained dominance. Estevao scored in the 59th minute from close range.Neto finished his hat-trick in the 71st minute after being assisted by Delap.In the other fourth-round match, Wrexham A.F.C. won 1-0 against Ipswich Town F.C.

FC Goa vs Inter Kashi

The long wait is finally over. After months of uncertainty, administrative reshuffle and endless speculation, the Indian Super League is back in a leaner, shorter format and with everything to play for from day one.The new edition, delayed by nearly four months, will be held in a truncated format featuring 14 teams.With limited time remaining in the football calendar, the All India Football Federation has opted for a single round-robin format, scrapping the second leg and the traditional playoff stage.Each team will play 13 matches across a three-month league, and the side finishing on top of the table will be crowned champion.Defending champions and Kolkata giants Mohun Bagan Super Giant will kick off the season at home, hosting Kerala Blasters FC in the opening clash at 5pm at the Salt Lake Stadium on Saturday.The fixture pits two of the largest fan bases in Indian football against each other and promises a high-voltage start to a season unlike any other.In the evening, newly-promoted Inter Kashi will be tested when they face Super Cup champions FC Goa in an away clash beginning 7.30pm.There will be no second chances, no knockouts but just 91 high-stakes matches where consistency alone will decide the champion.The season's launch comes as a major relief for participating clubs after months of uncertainty.The League itself had been hanging in the balance over the past few months after Football Sports Development Limited -- the Reliance-backed company that launched and ran the ISL since 2014 -- exited after its Master Rights Agreement with the AIFF ended.There was no immediate clarity on who would take charge, raising serious doubts about whether the season would even take place.Months of uncertainty finally eased only after the Union Sports Ministry intervened, helping the AIFF put a new arrangement in place and ensuring that the country's top-tier football competition could go ahead.However everything is not fully settled and there are several unanswered questions as several teams are still finalising their squads, and a few are expected to begin the season without foreign players.There has already been disruption before kickoff --the February 16 fixture between Odisha FC and Punjab FC has been put on hold as Odisha are yet to confirm their home venue.There was also confusion around the broadcast plans until late in the build-up.It has now been confirmed that all matches will be streamed on FanCode and telecast on Sony Sports Ten 2, according to an AIFF release.On the field, Mohun Bagan enter as favourites.The core of last season’s title-winning squad remains intact, and playing in front of their passionate supporters gives them an early edge.Head coach Sergio Lobera made it clear that excuses will not be entertained.""It will be a difficult season for everyone, but finally, this is the moment to try and find solutions and not find excuses,” he said.Forward Dimi Petratos struck a confident note: “We have the best squad in the country and we have trained well and we have come here to win.”The Blasters, however, have strengthened key areas with new foreign signings and believe they can spoil the party. Head coach David Català acknowledged the challenge but remained optimistic.“They are defending champions and best team in the country but in football everything is possible and one never knows what's going to happen. We are focused on tomorrow's game and we will try to get all three points,” he said.Goa, who have had competitive exposure this season, will look to use that rhythm to their advantage.Head coach Manolo Márquez expects a tight contest against the debutants.“My expectations are that it will be a difficult and a very equal game for both the teams,” he said.Inter Kashi, promoted after winning the I-League, arrive with ambition and belief.Head coach Antonio Habas emphasised the importance of making a strong first impression in their maiden ISL campaign.“It’s very important to create your first impression. We have to do really good in our first ISL season,” he said.",Mohun Bagan host Kerala Blasters in the opening match of the new Indian Super League season.

Major Tre Johnson's achievements



Former Washington offensive lineman Tre’ Johnson has died at the age of 54, leaving behind a legacy that reached far beyond the football field. Johnson passed away Sunday morning while on a family trip. His death was confirmed by his wife, Irene, who shared the heartbreaking news publicly. What began as private time with loved ones ended in sudden tragedy, sending shockwaves through the football community and the classrooms where he later built a second career.Johnson’s life reflected discipline. He anchored the offensive line in Washington to mentoring students in Maryland, he built respect in every space he entered. He leaves behind his wife, Irene, and their four children, Chloe, EJ, EZ, and Eden. As tributes continue to surface, many remember both the Pro Bowl guard and the devoted father who never missed a game or practice.Details surrounding Johnson’s passing remain limited. His wife described the loss as sudden and unexpected. In a Facebook post, she wrote, “It is with a heavy heart that I inform you that my husband, Tre’ Johnson, passed away suddenly and unexpectedly ...during a brief family trip. His four children, Chloe, EJ, EZ and Eden, extended family, friends, and I are devastated and in shock.”Johnson had recently taken a leave of absence from his teaching position due to health issues. Further specifics have not been released.Irene Johnson shared additional words that painted a picture of a devoted father and husband. “If you know Tre' you know what a devoted and loving father, he was to his children,” she wrote. “Tre' lived for his kid’s sports activities and supported them through every practice and game until he took his last breath. He shared his passion for Frenchie’s and riding his motorcycle with me and his fellow biking buddies.”She also reflected on his love for football and education. “He loved the game and prided himself on his tremendous knowledge of it.” Speaking about his work as a teacher, she added, “After retirement, he also found his second career passion, education. He worked as a History Teacher at the Landon School in Bethesda Maryland, where he was beloved by the young male students he mentored and the faculty. His recent battles with health issues forced him to take a leave of absence. We will miss him so much.”Johnson starred at Temple before Washington selected him with the 31st overall pick in the 1994 NFL Draft. Over nine NFL seasons, including time with Cleveland, he appeared in 93 games and became a steady force on the offensive line. His standout 1999 season earned him Pro Bowl honors as Washington reached the playoffs.After football, Johnson shaped young minds at the Landon School in Bethesda, Maryland. On the field and in the classroom, he led with strength, knowledge, and commitment.","Former Washington offensive lineman Tre' Johnson has died at the age of 54.

Brian Fleury joins Seattle Seahawks as offensive coordinator after Klint Kubiak exit



Brian Fleury is now the man trusted to keep the Seattle Seahawks offense humming after its championship rise. Just days after lifting the Super Bowl LX trophy against the New England Patriots, Seattle moved quickly to fill a sudden void on its coaching staff. Change arrived faster than celebration faded.Seattle’s decision followed Klint Kubiak leaving to lead the Las Vegas Raiders. The search did not linger. The Seahawks turned to a familiar rival assistant with a steady climb and a reputation for detail. The timing matters. This offense is not rebuilding. It is protecting something it worked hard to become.“The Seahawks are hiring Brian Fleury as their offensive coordinator, sources tell The Insiders. A trusted assistant to Kyle Shanahan in San Francisco since 2019, Fleury now heads to an NFC West rival to call plays for the defending Super Bowl champs,” Tom Pelissero reported.At 47, Brian Fleury arrives after seven seasons with the San Francisco 49ers, where he built his value patiently. He began on defense, then grew into run game coordinator and tight ends coach. Along the way, he earned trust from Kyle Shanahan and helped shape one of the league’s most reliable offensive systems.Now he inherits a unit that already believes in itself. Seattle averaged 28.4 points per game last season, third best in the league. Jaxon Smith-Njigba blossomed into Offensive Player of the Year. Sam Darnold completed his long redemption arc with a championship. Stability, not rescue, is the assignment.Fleury’s tight ends background could quietly shape the next step. Young players like Elijah Arroyo and AJ Barner may find larger roles as the offense evolves. His run game experience also matters, especially with Super Bowl MVP Kenneth Walker III due for a new contract. Keeping Walker in Seattle could be as important as any play call Fleury makes.Seattle explored other options. Quarterbacks coach Andre Janocko was considered but instead joined Kubiak in Las Vegas. In the end, Seattle chose continuity in philosophy, even if it comes from a division rival.The roster remains strong. The expectations remain higher. And now, the responsibility shifts to a coach who has waited years for this kind of trust.","Brian Fleury joins Seattle Seahawks as offensive coordinator after Klint Kubiak exit.

A pink Bronco, Olympic history and a romance growing stronger

Snowboard icon Chloe Kim returned from the Milano Cortina 2026 Winter Games with another historic podium finish and a moment that quickly melted hearts far beyond the halfpipe. The Olympic silver medalist celebrated Valentine’s week with Cleveland Browns defensive star Myles Garrett, whose grand gesture turned a milestone achievement into one of the most talked-about love stories of the Games.Kim’s performance already secured her place in history as the first female halfpipe rider to medal in three consecutive Winter Olympics. Yet it was the off-snow celebration that sent social media into a frenzy. A cascade of pink and white flowers appeared on her Instagram story days before a surprise reveal hinted that Garrett had planned something far more personal to honor both Valentine’s Day and her Olympic success.Garrett’s gift arrived in dramatic fashion: a customized pink Ford Bronco valued at more than $100,000. The vehicle featured bespoke touches, including the initials “CK” stitched into the seats, a detail that underscored the personal nature of the present. Kim shared her reaction online, saying she was “obsessed,” while Garrett confirmed the gesture with a kiss emoji that delighted fans following their relationship.The Browns star also traveled to Italy to support Kim during the competition, standing by as she secured silver behind South Korea’s Chòi Gaon. Observers spotted the couple celebrating together, reinforcing the sense that their bond continues to deepen amid demanding athletic schedules.In a recent interview, Kim described Garrett’s presence in her life with warmth and gratitude. “He's my best friend, truly... Despite his busy life and his busy schedule, he's always shown up for me and I try to do the same for him,” she said.Another aspect that she added to their relationship is the daily familiarity that makes their relationship down to earth: It is so funny when you just find someone who you have so much in common with... we like to do nothing but just sit round, and anime, we like to play the same games, we like the same foods.The two were initially rumored to be together in May 2025 at the Anime Awards in Tokyo. Another indication of a mutual support and friendship in a partnership, several months later, is that they share milestones and moments together without saying a word and are both just fond of life outside the limelight.","Chloe Kim is the first female halfpipe rider to medal in three consecutive Winter Olympics.

“May you feel the fierce”: Fans wonder if Kayla Nicole’s self-love message was aimed at Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/may-you-feel-the-fierce-fans-wonder-if-kayla-nicoles-self-love-message-was-aimed-at-travis-kelce-and-taylor-swift/articleshow/128381972.cms,"Kayla Nicole’s Valentine’s Day Instagram story, featuring a quote about self-love and emotional grounding, sparked online speculation due to its timing and reflective tone. Some fans wondered if it subtly referenced her past with Travis Kelce and his relationship with Taylor Swift. However, the message mentioned no names, focusing instead on healing, resilience, and the importance of inner stability.

Valentine’s Day post from Kayla Nicole fuels Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift buzz

Kayla Nicole's Valentine's Day Instagram story has caused a mass of conjecture in the social media with fans decoding each word to disguise its meaning. The media personality and fitness host gave a thought-provoking post regarding love and self-worth, on a pastel backdrop. Several minutes later, the screenshots were shared on the internet, and fans started to discuss whether the time and the tone were a hint at her former relationship with Travis Kelce and his ongoing affair with Taylor Swift.The post came on a day when it already had a lot of symbolism. The traditional idea of Valentine's Day is to make people confess their love publicly, but Nicole indulged in another path and made the focal point not the couple, but the emotional and self-focused ideas. That contrast alone fueled theories that the message may have carried subtext rather than serving as a simple holiday reflection.Nicole’s story featured a quote that read: “may the sweetest, deepest, most resonant kind of love find you. and, i just don’t mean romantic love. may you feel the fierce, sustaining love of chosen family, the steady love for your work, the restorative love for nature, and most importantly the foundational, non-negotiable love for the person in the mirror.i hope this holistic love acts as a warm anchor, keeping you steady through every inevitable storm. ”The words emphasize inner stability, community, and personal growth rather than romantic partnership. That distinction is key. Nicole and Kelce dated for several years before their high-profile breakup, and public interest in their past has only intensified since Kelce’s relationship with Swift became a global talking point.Nevertheless, Kelce and Swift are not mentioned anywhere in the post. Digital culture experts also tend to observe that viewers impose narratives onto vague messages, particularly when celebrities present reflexive content during emotionally charged situations. The quote as such revolves around resilience and self-acceptance, which are prevalent in wellness and growth self-help areas.The post was empowering and universal to some of the followers. To some others the timing was open to interpretation. There is no suggestion of a shade in a direct commentary about Nicole and any indication of a shade is pure speculation bid by the popular interest.What is evident is the fact that the message that Nicole was sharing echoed across the world since it changed the discussion about valentine day and made it focus on self-love. Intentionally or not, that reframing resonated with a culture that is still obsessed with celebrity relationships.","Kayla Nicole's Valentine's Day Instagram story has caused a mass of conjecture in the social media with fans decoding each word to disguise its meaning.

Fact check: Did Stefon Diggs really say Cardi B used him just to heal from Offset?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/fact-check-did-stefon-diggs-really-say-cardi-b-used-him-just-to-heal-from-offset/articleshow/128381764.cms,"Viral social media posts claim Stefon Diggs felt Cardi B used him to recover from her split with Offset, but no verified source confirms he made such statements. The narrative gained traction online after public appearances fueled speculation. Without confirmation from Diggs, Cardi B, or credible outlets, the claims remain unverified, reflecting internet rumor culture rather than established fact.

Viral posts allege Cardi B used Stefon Diggs — what is actually confirmed?

Social media has become inundated with rumors of NFL star Stefon Diggs and rapper Cardi B since being swept by posts that are going viral asserting heartbreak, betrayal, and emotional aftermath. There is a widely spread post which claims that Diggs thought the relationship was true only to realize that he had been involved in a temporary emotional healing. The rumors quickly went viral and took hold among fans who were already invested in the high-profiled break of Cardi B and Offset.The story was further fueled by the fact that it was alleged that Diggs was the person who was by Cardi when she was going through the most difficult periods of her life. It even alleged that when she would see him in the society, he felt abandoned. Yet despite the emotional tone of these viral claims, there is no verified statement from Diggs confirming these sentiments, and no credible reporting has substantiated the dramatic version of events circulating online.The social media post at the center of the speculation states: “Stefon Diggs reportedly says he truly believed Cardi B loved him, but now feels she may have only been using him to heal from Offset 💔”It continues: “According to reports, Stefon was there for Cardi during her toughest moments amid the divorce drama — giving her love, attention, support, and treating her like a queen.” He stood by her when she needed a shoulder, emotionally and physically, thinking it was real.”“But things allegedly changed when Stefon saw Cardi living her best life, dancing to Bad Bunny at the Super Bowl, while his team was struggling and losing 9–0 — a moment he felt he needed her support the most. Now, Stefon is questioning everything… wondering if the love was genuine or if he was just part of her healing phase before she moved on once she felt okay again.”Despite the detailed narrative, these statements remain unverified. The allegations that Diggs has made such comments have not been substantiated by any reputable sports journalists, entertainment sources, or even by other first hand sources.Viral relationship speculation tend to amalgamate fan interpretation with selective things that have been photographed by a camera, and this may not give the entire picture when it comes to the relationships.Public appearance particularly at events such as Super Bowl, is rarely a reflection of the entire picture of the relationships behind the scenes. According to media literacy experts, high-profile breakups and rebounds will tend to draw media coverage that has more to do with fan allegiance and social media interaction than with truthful reporting.Until either Diggs or Cardi B directly addresses the rumors, the allegation will not be proven truth but a mere speculation. In the meantime the internet demands emotional drama over established reality in the story.","Viral posts allege Cardi B used Stefon Diggs. No verified source confirms he made such statements.

Kylie & Travis on Babysitting All Four Nieces, Best Man Speeches & First Impression Mai Tais | Ep 53

Travis Kelce’s larger-than-life football persona gained an unexpectedly adorable twist this week. During a playful appearance on Not Gonna Lie with Kylie Kelce, the Kansas City Chiefs tight end discovered he had been given a new title: symbolic “zoo parent. ” The surprise arrived just days before Super Bowl weekend, offering a lighthearted moment for a player accustomed to the high-pressure spotlight and relentless media attention that follows him year-round.The reveal also highlighted Kelce’s off-field personality, one shaped as much by humor and family ties as by championship rings. Hosted by his sister-in-law Kylie Kelce, the podcast episode unfolded as a relaxed family chat before turning into a heartfelt gesture that connected Kelce’s love for animals with a meaningful conservation effort.The surprise came when Kylie and her co-hosts revealed they had symbolically adopted a giant river otter at the Philadelphia Zoo in Kelce’s name, using his family nickname, “Uncle Trav.” The NFL star, clearly caught off guard, responded with enthusiasm and disbelief.""Every time I go past some sort of creek or river, in my mind, there's an otter standing up on a rock waving to me,"" Travis said on the podcast. ""I've had dreams like this.This is crazy. It's just, like, I just know they're the friendliest.""Moments later, Kylie delivered the reveal: ""As a special surprise from us here at NGL, we actually adopted a giant river otter at the Philadelphia Zoo in your name.""Kelce embraced the gesture instantly. ""First of all, big zoo guy,"" he said. ""Uncle Trav, this is amazing.""The Philadelphia Zoo joined the fun. Maggie Morse, senior director of animal care, welcomed Kelce’s new role, noting the zoo is proud to support “funcles like Uncle Trav and Robert Irwin.” She also joked that Kelce could visit the otter family anytime he needs a break from babysitting his nieces, adding that otters prefer fish to Taylor Swift’s sourdough.While giant river otters are far from cuddly house pets, Kelce leaned into the moment, joking about babysitting duties and arriving with sardines in hand. The exchange captured why fans gravitate toward him. Beyond his Hall-of-Fame résumé, Kelce’s warmth, humor, and genuine curiosity about the world keep him relatable.For Kelce, the adoption is symbolic. For fans, it is another glimpse of a superstar who remains disarmingly human.","Travis Kelce received a giant river otter symbolically adopted in his name at the Philadelphia Zoo.

The Valentine’s Day silence that caught fans’ attention immediately

The Super Bowl unfollow that started the speculation

They unfollowed each other after the Super Bowl.







They did not post about each other on Valentine’s Day.







Neither has publicly confirmed a breakup.







Valentine’s Day came and went and fans were watching closely. After weeks of speculation following their post-Super Bowl Instagram unfollow, many expected Cardi B and Stefon Diggs to either shut down rumors or make a statement with a holiday post. But February 14 passed without a single public tribute, tag, or mention from either side. Now, social media is asking the same question: is it officially over?When it comes to celebrity couples, Valentine’s Day is practically a soft launch holiday. Big gestures, romantic captions, and coordinated posts are almost expected especially from high-profile names like Cardi B and Stefon Diggs.But this year? Nothing.No Instagram grid post. No story shoutout. No subtle tag. Fans quickly noticed that Cardi B did not share anything referencing Diggs, and Diggs remained equally quiet. Given the timing just days after their Instagram unfollow made headlines the silence felt louder than usual.For many followers, Valentine’s Day would have been the perfect opportunity to shut down breakup rumors. Instead, the lack of interaction only fueled more speculation.The first red flag for fans came shortly after the Super Bowl, when social media users noticed that Cardi B and Stefon Diggs had unfollowed each other on Instagram.In today’s celebrity world, an unfollow rarely goes unnoticed. Screenshots circulated quickly, and entertainment outlets began reporting on potential tension between the two.Neither Cardi B nor Stefon Diggs has publicly addressed the unfollow or commented on their current relationship status. That silence, combined with the Valentine’s Day absence, has led many to believe something may have shifted behind the scenes.However, it’s important to note that social media activity does not automatically confirm a breakup. Fans have been analyzing everything from captions to timing. Some argue that skipping Valentine’s Day publicly suggests the relationship has cooled off. Others believe it could simply be a decision to keep things private.Celebrity couples sometimes step back from posting together during busy schedules, personal transitions, or to avoid public scrutiny. Without a statement from either Cardi B or Stefon Diggs, any conclusion remains speculation.Right now, the only confirmed facts are:At this point, Cardi B and Stefon Diggs’ relationship status remains unclear.

in the 2026as he continues to recover from a hamstring strain. The Los Angeles Lakers guard, representing Team World, recently said he feels well enough to play “a little bit” in the event at Intuit Dome in Inglewood, California.He missed time before the break but avoided a long-term setback. His status adds interest to an All-Star Game that is introducing a new format this season. Even with restricted minutes, Doncic remains one of the most watched players on the court.This year’s All-Star Game replaces the traditional setup with a round-robin tournament featuring Team USA Stars, USA Stripes, and Team World. The games will take place on February 16, starting at 5 p.m. ET, with four contests scheduled for 12 minutes each.Doncic’s participation stands out because of his recent move to the Lakers and his scoring ability. While he is not expected to handle a full workload, he could still provide short offensive bursts.Doncic strained his left hamstring earlier in February and missed the Lakers’ final four games before the All-Star break. He went through warmups during that stretch but did not play so he could focus on recovery.A strong workout on February 13 helped clear him for the All-Star Game, though his role is expected to be controlled. Doncic joked that fans should not expect him to dunk on LeBron James, suggesting he will avoid unnecessary risk.Team World will be coached by Darko Rajaković and features several established international players. The roster does not include inactive or traded players, but Giannis Antetokounmpo and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander have both been ruled out with injuries.Team World will face USA Stars, a younger group that includes Cade Cunningham and Scottie Barnes. The winner moves on to play USA Stripes, led by veterans such as LeBron James, Kevin Durant, and Kawhi Leonard.That format could place Doncic on the floor against his Lakers teammate. If Team World loses its opener, it will play in Game 3, where point differential could still decide the final pairing.Also read: USA vs World NBA All-Star game predictions, odds, spread, moneyline, best prop bets, and more (February 15, 2026) Players on the winning team will receive $125,000, giving the tournament some competitive weight.For Doncic, the game also serves as preparation ahead of the Lakers’ playoff run. He had been on a stretch of 30-point performances before the injury, and the All-Star appearance offers a chance to return without pushing too hard.","Luka Doncic is expected to play limited minutes for Team World in the 2026 NBA All-Star Game.

after the release of her first signature basketball shoe, making it clear that Reebok sees her as central to its return to the sport. As president of Reebok Basketball, O’Neal said Reese reflects the direction the company wants to take as it rebuilds its presence in the market.The launch comes at a time when women’s basketball is drawing more commercial attention. Reese’s sellout and expanding partnerships show her influence is growing off the court as well, strengthening her position as one of the league’s most marketable players while supporting Reebok’s long-term plan.The “Angel Reese 1” released in three colorways on February 13, 2026, and sold out across major retailers in less than a day. The response backed Reebok’s decision to build its basketball strategy around her visibility and appeal.The shoe combines performance features with elements tied to Reese’s personal style, including references to her time with the Chicago Sky. Reebok CEO Todd Krinsky called her their “top pick,” saying she represents the swagger the company wants to bring back.O’Neal and vice president Allen Iverson selected Reese as the brand’s first major signee in October 2023. Explaining the move, O’Neal said, “Angel represents everything this new era of Reebok basketball is about - power, confidence, and impact on and off the court. She’s a competitor, a leader, and she’s unapologetically herself.”He added, “She’s the face of what’s next,” placing her at the center of the company’s relaunch.Reese was involved throughout the process. Before signing, she visited Reebok headquarters, met with executives, and contributed to product design. That involvement helped move the partnership from apparel tests in 2024 to a signature shoe in 2026.Reese decided to lead Reebok’s rebuild instead of signing with Nike or Adidas, relying in part on her LSU connection with O’Neal and the opportunity for a larger role. After agreeing to the deal, she worked with Portia Blunt’s team on product development and helped launch the “Reebok by Angel” line in August 2024.Her multiyear extension makes her only the second WNBA player with a Reebok signature shoe. The immediate sellout showed strong demand and placed her in a small group of players with proven retail pull.Reese explained her decision by saying, “I chose Reebok… I wanted to be that [face].”Also read: Chris Paul’s all-time ranking: Does the veteran point guard land in the top 5 after his 2026 retirement?

Early Outlook for this Mock Trade

Theare reportedly exploring a trade that would bringto the team. The move is being discussed as a way to strengthen the roster around Victor Wembanyama and support a push toward playoff contention in the 2025-26 season.San Antonio has stayed competitive in the Western Conference, while Dallas has fallen to 19-34. With both teams heading in different directions, a deal could address immediate needs for each side. The Spurs would add outside shooting and experience, and the Mavericks could create salary flexibility while reshaping the roster.The San Antonio Spurs are built around Victor Wembanyama and a young group that includes Devin Vassell, Stephon Castle, Keldon Johnson, and Julian Champagnie. Veterans Harrison Barnes, Kelly Olynyk, and Luke Kornet are on expiring contracts, giving the front office options if it chooses to make a move.Dallas Mavericks have used Klay Thompson mostly off the bench alongside Anthony Davis, Kyrie Irving, P.J. Washington, Cooper Flagg, and Dereck Lively II. Recent losses have highlighted the team’s inconsistent three-point shooting.The finances make a trade possible. Thompson carries a $16.7 million cap hit for 2025-26, while expiring deals such as Olynyk’s $25.5 million and Barnes’ $28.5 million can help match salaries without requiring draft picks.One scenario would send Klay Thompson and injured guard Dante Exum to San Antonio. Dallas could receive Kelly Olynyk, Lindy Waters III, and either Harrison Barnes or Keldon Johnson to keep the incoming and outgoing salary near the $18-20 million range.This approach allows the Spurs to keep their young core, Wembanyama, Vassell, and Castle, while Dallas clears Thompson’s $17.5 million expiring contract for the 2026-27 season. It also helps the Mavericks manage second-apron pressure.Klay Thompson would give San Antonio a reliable catch-and-shoot option and more spacing around Wembanyama and Vassell. His experience could also help younger players such as Castle and Harper. Even with the move, the Spurs are projected to have about $41 million in cap space for 2026.Dallas would lower payroll by roughly $3.2 million this season and open minutes for younger players such as Flagg or Christie. The added flexibility could help the team build around Irving and Davis while avoiding deeper tax penalties.• Immediate shooting help with a 37.6% three-point shooter.• Veteran presence for a roster that averages around 25 years old.• Expiring contracts help protect future cap space.• Thompson’s age does not match Wembanyama’s timeline.• Trading Olynyk removes a stretch-five and reduces depth.• Financial relief and more roster flexibility.• More opportunities for younger players.• Loss of a proven shooter despite a 35.8% win rate.The potential pairing would put 22-year-old, 7-foot-4 Wembanyama next to the 36-year-old Thompson, a 6-foot-6 guard. Moving the 34-year-old Olynyk would help the Spurs stay younger overall while continuing to build around their franchise player.Also read: NBA trade rumors: Los Angeles Lakers predicted to land Utah Jazz's Walker Kessler amid LeBron James free agency If the trade happens, San Antonio would take a step toward competing sooner without giving up future assets.

Impact on LeBron’s future

Who benefits?

Thehave been connected to a possible trade foras the team weighs its current title push against an uncertain future. Los Angeles is 33-21, leads the Pacific Division, and is building around Luka Dončić, LeBron James, and Deandre Ayton. With James on an expiring contract and expected to reach free agency in 2026, the front office has reason to look for younger players who can contribute now and remain part of the roster later.Kessler fits that profile. He is productive, still early in his career, and under team control for the short term. Several teams are monitoring his situation, but the Lakers stand out because of their need for interior defense and long-term stability at center.The Los Angeles Lakers are competing near the top of the Western Conference and are focused on strengthening a playoff roster. Planning ahead matters with James’ future unresolved, and adding a younger impact player would help reduce the risk of a major drop-off if he leaves.Utah is in a rebuild. The Jazz are 18-38 and sit 13th in the West despite strong scoring from Lauri Markkanen and a roster filled with recent first-round picks.Defense has been a problem for two straight seasons, and reported tension around Kessler’s extension, believed to be in the nine-figure range over five years, has increased the chances that the team could move him.On the court, Walker Kessler is averaging roughly 14.4 points, 10.8 rebounds, and 3.0 assists while shooting above 70 percent from the field with true shooting over 78 percent. His rim protection remains his main value, which explains why contenders are paying attention.A trade would likely focus on young talent and draft picks rather than a core player.Possible structure:- Los Angeles Lakers receive: Walker Kessler- Utah Jazz receive:• A young rotation player on a rookie-scale contract• A salary-matching veteran on a short or mid-range deal• At least one future first-round pick and a second-round pickKessler’s current salary makes matching contracts manageable. Utah would prioritize long-term assets, while the Lakers are unlikely to move Dončić, James, Ayton, or other key contributors if the goal is to compete this season.The framework could expand depending on negotiations. Utah might try to include another veteran contract, and Los Angeles could add a minimum-salary player or pick swap to finalize value.Kessler would improve interior defense and rebounding, allowing perimeter defenders to pressure the ball more often. He also gives the team another starting-level center next to Ayton, creating lineup flexibility and injury insurance. His timeline matches Dončić’s prime years, which helps the franchise plan beyond the James era.Moving Kessler would turn a pending extension into draft capital and a developmental player. It would also ease a crowded frontcourt that includes Jusuf Nurkić, Kevin Love, Taylor Hendricks, and Kyle Filipowski. The move would better align with a young perimeter group featuring Keyonte George, Isaiah Collier, Cody Williams, Ace Bailey, Brice Sensabaugh, and Walter Clayton Jr..Kessler scores mostly on high-percentage attempts such as lobs, dunks, and short rolls, making him a strong fit next to a ball-dominant creator like Dončić. Utah allowing 125.9 points per game also raises the question of whether committing major money to one defensive center makes sense during a rebuild.• Stronger paint defense.• Adds a young core player.• Greater lineup flexibility with two starting-caliber centers.• Likely cost includes a first-round pick and a young contributor.• Future salary pressure if Kessler signs a large extension.• Possible overlap with another traditional center.• Gains draft assets before an expensive extension.• Clears minutes in the frontcourt.• Maintains financial flexibility.• Defense could decline further without a proven rim protector.• Continued rebuilding may test fan patience.• Draft picks carry uncertainty.Trading for Kessler would show that the Lakers remain focused on competing while James is still under contract. It would also leave the team with a younger foundation if he decides to leave in 2026.In the short term, the Lakers would likely improve by adding an efficient young center without breaking up their core. Utah’s outcome would depend on how the incoming assets develop compared to Kessler’s progress.Also read: NBA trade rumors: Los Angeles Clippers predicted to cut ties with $152.4 million superstar prior offseason after blockbuster James Harden departure The deal has a clear logic for both sides, immediate help for a contender and long-term value for a rebuilding team.",The Los Angeles Lakers and Utah Jazz have been linked to a possible trade for Walker Kessler.

My Final Thoughts on Chris Paul's All-Time Ranking in the NBA

, ending a career that lasted more than 20 seasons. Few point guards managed games as carefully as he did, and even fewer combined passing, scoring, and defense at the same level for so long.Still, his place in history is not fully settled. Many analysts rank him somewhere between fourth and eighth among all-time point guards. The disagreement usually comes down to what matters more, championships and MVP awards, or consistency, efficiency, and long-term production.Chris Paul stepped away from the league shortly after being waived by the Toronto Raptors. He finished with 1,370 regular-season games and totals of 23,058 points, 6,006 rebounds, 12,552 assists, and 2,728 steals. He became the first player in NBA history to record at least 23,000 points and 12,000 assists.His honors include 12 All-Star selections, 11 All-NBA teams, and nine All-Defensive teams. He retired second in league history in both assists and steals, behind only John Stockton.Advanced statistics often rated him among the league’s most effective players. During his prime, he regularly ranked near the top in metrics such as box plus-minus, value over replacement player, and win shares per 48 minutes.Teams usually improved when he joined them. New Orleans became competitive, the Clippers turned into a regular 50-win team, Houston pushed Golden State to seven games, Oklahoma City exceeded expectations after trading Russell Westbrook, and Phoenix reached the 2021 Finals. Late stops with Golden State, San Antonio, and a brief return to the Clippers showed his durability, even though his final season was limited to 16 games, where he averaged 2.9 points and 3.3 assists before stopping play in December 2025.Most historical lists begin with Magic Johnson, Stephen Curry, and Oscar Robertson.Magic won five championships and redefined the position with his size and passing. Curry reshaped modern offense with his shooting while winning four titles and two MVP awards. Robertson produced historic all-around numbers and added both an MVP and a championship to his résumé.Because those three are widely placed at the top, Paul’s argument is usually about whether he belongs in the next two spots.The debate often includes Isiah Thomas, John Stockton, Jerry West (depending on how positions are defined), Jason Kidd, Steve Nash, Walt Frazier, and Bob Cousy.Several of them have achievements Paul does not. Thomas led Detroit to two championships and won Finals MVP. Kidd guided Dallas to the 2011 title and reached the Finals twice earlier in his career. Nash won two MVP awards. Stockton still holds large leads in career assists and steals.Supporters of Paul point to his efficiency. He shot better from three than Thomas or Kidd, committed fewer turnovers than Nash, and provided more reliable perimeter defense than many offense-focused guards.Paul never won an NBA title, and that remains the biggest argument against his top-five case.There were close calls. The Clippers lost a 3-1 series lead to Houston in 2015. Houston led Golden State 3-2 in the 2018 Western Conference Finals before Paul suffered a hamstring injury that kept him out of the final two games. Phoenix took a 2-0 lead in the 2021 Finals but lost the series in six.Even without a championship, his playoff record shows steady production which boasts 149 games, nearly 3,000 points, and 1,233 assists.Calling Chris Paul a top-five point guard is reasonable, but it is not universally accepted. His numbers, defense, and ability to improve teams support the argument.However, the lack of a title or MVP keeps some analysts from placing him automatically in that group. A common view puts Magic, Curry, and Robertson clearly at the top, with Paul competing alongside Isiah Thomas and John Stockton just behind them.Also read: Chris Paul NBA teams timeline: How the HOFer point guard played for nine franchises across a 21-year career For those who value championships most, his résumé may feel incomplete. For those who focus on performance, control of the game, and long-term impact, placing Chris Paul in the top five is a fair conclusion.","Chris Paul retired in February 2026 after a career that lasted more than 20 seasons.

IPL 2025 Winner Prediction: What Greenstone Lobo's Astrology says





: Outside the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad, there are big cutouts of two captains Shreyas Iyer and Rajat Patidar. The handful of fans hoping to see Virat Kohli were perplexed to see the image of Rajat Patidar. ""Who is he?,"" asked one of the fans outside Gate No. 1. The vendor, who was busy selling jerseys, replied angrily, ""he is the captain of the team whose jersey you are buying.""The poor guy had no clue about Rajat Patidar, and murmured, ""wasn't Kohli the captain?""The vendors aren’t particularly fans of the sport but they have a lot of hopes riding on the proceedings and the outcomes.""There isn't a buzz this time around. We failed to sell Rohit Sharma's jersey ahead of Qualifier 2, and now we are struggling to find buyers for Kohli's. We don’t care who wins as long as we are selling jerseys. Hopefully, we will have more sales on Tuesday,"" said Krupal, before he started chanting the rates of the jerseys.Like Krupal, Mohammed Aslam sells wristbands, caps, and flags. Aslam jogs down memory lane and reminisced about the IPL 2023 final match between Gujarat Titans and Chennai Super Kings.""Despite the heavy rain, the fans from CSK, who had travelled from Chennai, were so passionate.We sold all our items, but this time around, there is no such hype,"" he laughed.Krupal and Aslam are not wrong about the mood ahead of the final. On Sunday, hardly 50,000 people turned up to watch the Qualifier 2 match between Punjab Kings and Mumbai Indians. There were no buyers for many of the hospitality boxes as they were empty.The IPL final, which was shifted to the world's biggest stadium in Ahmedabad, has failed to create any buzz in the city. Hyderabad and Kolkata were supposed to host the playoffs as per the original dates but the venues were changed citing ""weather conditions."" The rain, however, has continued to follow the business end of the cash-rich league as there was a heavy shower ahead of Qualifier 2 and a light spell is expected on Tuesday as well.Even if the weather permits and the match goes ahead, it would be interesting to see whether the title clash will be able to fill the Narendra Modi Stadium.In the pre-match press conference, both captains chose to keep cards close to their chests. Shreyas Iyer spoke about lack of sleep while a soft-spoken and very un-RCB-like captain Rajat Patidar reserved praise for the fans and vowed not to get bogged down by the unreal expectation.The PBKS players, tired from their rain-affected marathon match, didn't turn up for the training session. Captain Shreyas left the venue after the photo shoot but RCB did train for around two hours.Once RCB left the ground, the pitch and the inner ring were immediately covered, and final touches were applied to the makeshift stage for the closing ceremony. India's leading musician Shankar Mahadevan, accompanied by his sons Siddharth and Shivam, will deliver a special performance in a tribute to India's armed forces.“See you at the FINAL tomorrow ❤️ What an honour this is!!!” Shivam Mahadevan shared his excitement on Instagram.Buzz or no buzz, one thing is for sure: there will be a new IPL champion. Between Bengaluru and Punjab, the wait of one franchise will end.","The IPL final has failed to create any buzz in the city.

Poll Will Shreyas Iyer's performance lead Punjab Kings to their first IPL title this season? Yes, definitely! No, they will fall short.

IPL 2025 Winner Prediction: What Greenstone Lobo's Astrology says





In the Qualifier 2 vs Mumbai Indians, Punjab Kings captain Shreyas Iyer was unstoppable. The right-hander smashed 87 off just 41 balls and cleared the ropes on eight occasions during an exhibition of fabulous strokeplay.Opposition skipper Hardik Pandya used every card up his sleeve to unsettle Shreyas but nothing worked. Even Jasprit Bumrah and his accurate yorkers couldn't trouble the 30-year-old who was in the zone!Twenty three runs were needed off the last 12 balls and Shreyas switched the mode on when he smashed four sixes off Ashwani Kumar's 19th over to wrap up a tremendous win, and become the first captain to lead different IPL teams to finals in consecutive editions. While the discussion has revolved around the Mumbai cricketer's calibre as a captain, the ongoing season has further showcased his prowess as a game-changer with the bat.Over 600 runs this year is his best run in the IPL but what is even more significant is the 39 sixes. The PBKS captain smashed just 14 sixes in the previous edition and has almost tripled the tally. ""We worked on Shreyas' bat swing with a focus on helping him connect well.He has slammed 39 sixes so far this IPL while his overall tally of sixes in the previous three editions comes down to 30,"" said Shreyas' childhood coach Pravin Amre.""Shreyas' current strike-rate in IPL 2025 is 175.80 which he specifically focused on enhancing. He has also worked harder towards finishing games following the Champions Trophy 2025 where he played critical knocks but couldn't finish certain games. I told Shreyas, 'In India, we go with Raymond suits, which are stitched despite the availability of ready-made Gucci and Armani suits. Similarly, he should choose a technique which is tailor-made for his approach rather than trying to emulate someone else',"" added Amre.Shreyas' batting average this season currently stands at 54.82, which is quite impressive considering his average of 39.00 in the previous edition. The PBKS captain's average as a batter in IPL had never crossed 40 before the ongoing edition. Shreyas has further smashed six half-centuries this season as compared to the two fifties in the previous edition, setting his personal best records in the tournament.While the PBKS captain's performances have been truly impressive, the journey behind his dazzling transformation has been one of tremendous commitment, tracing back to 2024 when he was excluded from BCCI's central contracts.""As we know, Shreyas had suffered a back injury in 2023, as a result he had to miss the IPL and had further underwent surgery. It’s always a massive task for an individual to overcome it, both physically as well as mentally. Shreyas was looking forward to make a comeback. However, unfortunately he lost out on the central contract. It came as a big set back. It’s tough. But Shreyas looked at it as a window of opportunity to make use of the time. He regrouped a set of individuals to form his core team, and I was fortunate to be part of his journey along with the strength and conditioning coach and he himself. We named our working group as ‘Team Shreyas’,"" said physiotherapist Abhishek Sawant who has worked with the batter for close to a decade now.There was a lot of attention given to the mental aspect of the game and what stood out was the right-hander's relentless approach.“We had detailed out his journey with a holistic approach, dividing the transformation into three parts: Physio, S&C and his skill sets. Shreyas also underwent a mental switch, practising a lot of visualisation. There was exclusive focus during the period of two to three months on making him as robust as possible and getting him back into his best shape.""What stood out during the course is that Shreyas wanted us to keep pushing him. There were days when he woke up with a lot of soreness but there was no attempt to escape the grind. He's gone through so much toil that any challenge seems easy,"" said Sawant.During that difficult period, there was never a dip in the level of dedication and extreme focus helped him return an even better cricketer and stronger individual.""His current level of excellence is because of his pure dedication, doing the right things at the right time and being extremely focused. The results are in front of everyone,"" concluded Sawant.",Shreyas Iyer is the first captain to lead different IPL teams to finals in consecutive editions. The 30-year-old smashed 87 off just 41 balls in Qualifier 2 vs Mumbai Indians.

Arshdeep Singh: The Poet Who Bowls Thunder | Stories from His Father & Coach





Punjab Kings captain Shreyas Iyer displayed visible anger towards teammate Shashank Singh after their IPL 2025 Qualifier 2 victory against Mumbai Indians at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad. Despite Iyer's match-winning unbeaten 87 runs off 41 balls that guided Punjab Kings to their second IPL final, he was seen berating Shashank Singh for his run-out during the crucial chase of 204 runs.The incident occurred immediately after Iyer hit the winning six off Ashwani Kumar's bowling. While the Punjab Kings team rushed to celebrate with their captain, the heated moment occurred when Shashank Singh approached Iyer.Iyer confronted Shashank with strong words and gestures, clearly expressing his disappointment over the latter's run-out in the 17th over. Iyer was seen pointing fingers at Shashank, who remained silent but visibly disappointed during the exchange.The run-out incident took place on the fourth ball of the 17th over when Shashank was dismissed for just 2 runs. The dismissal came off Trent Boult's bowling when Shashank hit a low full-toss towards Hardik Pandya at mid-on.Mumbai Indians captain Pandya's quick fielding and direct hit caught Shashank short of his crease at the non-striker's end.While initial viewing suggested Shashank had made it safely, replays revealed his casual approach to running between the wickets.The absence of a diving effort from Shashank added to the nervousness for Punjab Kings at that crucial juncture in the match.Despite the run-out incident, Punjab Kings successfully chased down the target of 204 runs with five wickets remaining and six balls to spare. Iyer's explosive innings of 87 not out proved decisive in securing the victory.The win has set up Punjab Kings' path to their second IPL final, where they will face Royal Challengers Bengaluru, led by Rajat Patidar.

Shubman Gill story: From a remote village near the border to India’s Test captain

Poll Do you believe Shubman Gill is ready for the role of Test captain? Yes, he has the skills. No, he lacks experience.

Shubman Gill returns to the city where it all started for him as a youngster





: Newly-appointed India Test captain Shubman Gill is set for a trial by fire in the five-match assignment in England, where he will venture into uncharted territory.The absence of experienced campaigners — following the recent retirement of Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma — will only make Gill’s task tougher. While doubts have been raised regarding Gill’s elevation to red-ball captaincy, given his not-sofantastic returns away from home, legendary Australian fast bowler Glenn McGrath backed the 25-year-old to come good in his new role.“I’m keen to see how India go under Gill. I just like the way he goes about it. He is pretty composed. I like his body language. I know that he has done better on home soil than abroad. That is the next challenge. He will want to go over there and set the standard in England. Batting in England is a lot different to batting in India,” McGrath, the director of coaching at the MRF Pace Foundation, said here on Monday.“It will be a challenge for him, but I think that Gill has got good composure. He will be a good Test captain. India do not have the experience that they had with Rohit and Virat. So they have got to go over there and enjoy,” McGrath added.Gill will undoubtedly rely on Jasprit Bumrah’s wizardry on seamfriendly surfaces, but will have to prepare a good-enough plan ‘B’ as the pace spearhead is likely to be rested for a game or two. Asked if India are over reliant on Bumrah to create a telling impact, McGrath replied that the pacer relishes rising to the big occasions.“In Australia, they over-relied on Bumrah. He had to bowl more than he wanted. In the end, that is where the injury (back issue) probably came from. He enjoys that extra responsibility. When he captained India in Perth, he stepped up and enjoyed the challenge. He will enjoy bowling with the Duke ball in English conditions,” McGrath said.“Bumrah looks like he is back to full fitness, so he is going to play a major part. He is a class bowler. He has not played the long version of the game (for months now), so India have to use the other bowlers well. The key to Bumrah’s longevity is how the bowlers around him bowl. If they bowl longer spells, Bumrah can get more rest.”Among the other members of the pace-bowling pack, Prasidh Krishna has caught McGrath’s eye. “If he can hit the right lengths, he is going to be dangerous with the bounce which he can get,” McGrath said.",Shubman Gill will captain India against England in the Test series in June.

IPL 2025 Winner Prediction: What Greenstone Lobo's Astrology says





: Punjab Kings captain Shreyas Iyer (87 off 41b; 5x4, 6x8) is a driven man this season. Both his intensity and batting have been in a different zone. Mistakes that used to cut short his innings appear to be a thing of the past.Batting with an open stance, Iyer has added a new dimension to his game, allowing himself to settle in before accelerating. On Sunday night against Mumbai Indians, what was amazing to watch was his zen-like demeanour as he took the game deep, with Punjab chasing a steep 204. He allowed partners batting with him to do the bulk of the scoring before putting the pedal on the accelerator and finishing the game with ease.Even when Iyer’s shot selection in the first qualifier against RCB was questioned, he didn’t entertain any doubts about his capabilities. Against MI, his act of not celebrating either his half-century or erupting in jubilation after taking his team over the line conveyed a sense of purpose. Iyer has unfinished business and his keen competitive instincts and astute captaincy, apart from his batting, will be crucial for Punjab in the final.Iyer played some extraordinary shots during his 87 not out (41 balls; 5x4, 8x6) against MI. Having arrived at the crease at the fall of opener Priyansh Arya’s wicket, with the team still needing 149 runs, he began with an aerial flick over square leg off left-arm pacer Ashwani Kumar.His ramp to a slower bouncer off Hardik Pandya in the 10th over was a demonstration of his presence of mind. The shot of the match came in the 18th over when he steered an on-point Jasprit Bumrah yorker nonchalantly through third man. It brought an end to Bumrah’s uncharacteristically wicketless spell (0/40) as MI’s hopes vanished.Through it all, Iyer remained composed, and only a mini-confrontation with Shashank Singh at the end of the game conveyed his displeasure with the manner of his teammate’s run-out dismissal. “Shreyas is calm. He doesn’t get flustered easily. He knows his matchups, knows what he has to do at certain times and he’s prepared to take that risk. When he was a younger player in Delhi, he was a little bit more explosive and gung-ho. He scores at a high strike rate now also because he knows when a bowler comes on and that’s his matchup, he’s going to take it,” Punjab’s bowling coach James Hopes said.Lavishing praise on his leadership skills, Hopes said, “With his captaincy tonight, we kept MI to 200 when I reckon they could have got 220, 230, just because of the way he pulled the strings out there and manoeuvred the bowling. We had Vyshak with one over left, but he took a gut call to give Azmatulah Omarzai an over and it worked. He’s a sensational captain and a player.”On his knock, Iyer told the official broadcaster, “I love such big occasions and I always say to myself and my colleagues that the bigger the occasion, the calmer you are and you’ll get the best results.

The IPL 2025 final promises a gripping showdown between two teams chasing history — Royal Challengers Bengaluru and Punjab Kings. For RCB, this marks a fourth shot at glory, having fallen short in three previous finals. But under the calm leadership of Rajat Patidar, they’ve staged a spirited comeback this season, peaking at the right time. Their 8-wicket demolition of PBKS in Qualifier 1 was a statement of intent, led by Patidar’s poise, Phil Salt’s fireworks, and a bowling unit firing on all cylinders.Punjab Kings, on the other hand, bounced back strongly in Qualifier 2, with Shreyas Iyer’s unbeaten 87 guiding them to a second-ever IPL final, their first since 2014. While RCB are fuelled by the desire to win their maiden title for stalwart Virat Kohli, PBKS are driven by the hunger to rewrite their legacy. It’s not just a contest of bat and ball, but of belief, redemption, and the weight of years of heartbreak.Total Matches Played: 36Royal Challengers Bengaluru: 18Punjab Kings: 18The pitch at Ahmedabad is expected to offer ideal conditions for batting, especially as the match progresses.The surface has a consistent grass covering and a hint of early moisture, but the intense heat is likely to dry it out quickly, making it a true wicket with good bounce and carry. The ball should come on nicely to the bat, favouring stroke play throughout the innings. The square boundaries measure 61 and 67 metres, while the straight boundary stretches to 73 metres, offering some help to the bowlers who can vary their lengths smartly.Priyansh Arya, Josh Inglis (wk), Shreyas Iyer (c), Nehal Wadhera, Marcus Stoinis, Shashank Singh, Azmatullah Omarzai, Kyle Jamieson, Vijaykumar Vyshak, Arshdeep Singh, Yuzvendra ChahalImpact Sub: Harpreet BrarVirat Kohli, Philip Salt, Rajat Patidar (c), Liam Livingstone, Jitesh Sharma (wk), Romario Shepherd, Krunal Pandya, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Yash Dayal, Josh Hazlewood, Suyash SharmaImpact Sub: Mayank AgarawalAs the IPL 2025 final unfolds under the lights in Ahmedabad, evening conditions will be warm and slightly muggy, with temperatures dipping to 29°C and a real feel of 30°C.

'We will try and win this for Virat Kohli': Rajat Patidar before IPL Final





The first unofficial Test match between India A and England Lions ended in a draw at Canterbury on Monday, with India A's top four batsmen each scoring half-centuries. After England Lions posted 587 in their first innings, surpassing India A's 557, the Indian batsmen utilized the final day to score 241 for 2 in 41 overs, with Yashasvi Jaiswal, Abhimanyu Easwaran, Dhruv Jurel, and Nitish Kumar Reddy all making valuable contributions.Yashasvi Jaiswal scored a quick 64 off 60 balls, while captain Abhimanyu Easwaran made 68 off 87 deliveries. The unbeaten pair of Dhruv Jurel and Nitish Kumar Reddy scored 53 and 52 respectively, with Reddy's innings coming off just 47 balls.India A coach Hrishikesh Kanitkar promoted Reddy to the number 4 position, allowing him valuable batting time ahead of the anticipated first Test against England at Leeds.Jurel, who had scored 94 in the first innings, strengthened his case with another half-century in the second innings, demonstrating his capability to play as a specialist batsman.The second innings began with Jaiswal hitting a six off left-arm seamer Josh Hull. Both Jaiswal and Easwaran matched each other's performance, each hitting eight boundaries in the post-lunch session.The batting track offered little challenge to the batsmen, with both teams' bowling attacks struggling to create any significant pressure.Quiz: Who's that IPL player?

Paris Saint-Germain - UEFA Champions League





Paris Saint-Germain winning the UEFA Champions League for the first time in its history puts an end to one of the longest searches for European glory. Established in 1970, the French side were yet to taste European success prior to the final at the Allianz Arena on Saturday. Luis Enrique and his men made easy work of Simone Inzaghi's Inter as they steamrolled the Italians 5-0 in the final. While PSG's victory tops off an exhilarating Champions League season, it wasn't just the Parisiens that put an end to their trophy drought.The 2024/25 season will be remembered as the year many teams across Europe put an end to their quest for silverware. With PSG being the latest addition to the list, teams like Tottenham Hotspur, Crystal Palace, Newcastle United and Bayern Munich's Harry Kane have all added trophies to their cabinets. Here's a closer look at how this year proved to be pivotal in the quest for silverware for several teams.Led by Ange Postecoglou from the dugout, Tottenham Hotspur were in the quest for a trophy to put an end to their excruciating 17-year search for silverware. Spurs, often mocked for their inability to claim trophies, further stacked the odds against their favour, when Postecoglou claimed that he 'usually wins trophies in his second season'.With an emphatic win over Premier League rivals Manchester United in the final, Spurs finally put an end to their search for a trophy. Brennan Johnson scored the winner in a narrow 1-0 win.The Eagles clinched a trophy for the first time in 120 years after a major upset in the FA Cup final. After losing twice in the final of the same competition, in 1990 and 2016, Palace beat Manchester City in the 2025 final 1-0 thanks to a goal from Eberechi Eze. The result meant that City went trophyless for the first time since 2016 and Palace claimed their first-ever FA Cup.Newcastle United claimed a major domestic trophy for the first time since 1955 as they beat Premier League champions Liverpool 2-1 in the final. Goals from Dan Burn and Alexander Isak ensured that the side managed by Eddie Howe put an end to the 70-year wait. The title triumph was Newcastle's first since the 1955 FA Cup win.In the same year Tottenham Hotspur won the UEFA Europa League, former club captain and current Bayern Munich striker Harry Kane also ended his search for a maiden career trophy. Despite joining the Bavarians last season, the Englishman ended his debut season in Germany without any trophy to show for it.However, after a dominant Bundesliga campaign in which he topped the goal scoring charts with 26 strikes, Bayern claimed back the German league title from Bayer Leverkusen, who ended Bayern's streak of 11 successive Bundesliga titles last season.Ever since the French side was taken over by the sovereign-wealth fund of Qatar in 2011, PSG has kept it a priority to get their hands on the UCL trophy. However, despite heavy spending and bringing in top talent from across Europe, the Parisiens kept falling short of the ultimate prize.Lionel Messi, Neymar Jr. and even Kylian Mbappe failed to bring European glory to the club. However, Luis Enrique's side, led by Ousmane Dembele in attack finally clinched the biggest club competition with a 5-0 win over Inter.","Paris Saint-Germain won the UEFA Champions League for the first time.

Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) fans recoiled in shock with a stunned silence after Barcelona pulled off a historic comeback in the second leg of their Champions League 2016/17 Round of 16 match. The Spanish giants became the first team in the European tournament's history to overturn a 4-0 deficit, defying odds of 200/1.""We lost everything in the closing minutes,"" said PSG manager Unai Emery. While Neymar delivered a performance for the ages, it was Barca manager Luis Enrique who maintained belief despite a scenario where the vast majority hardly gave the Spanish side a 1 percent chance of qualification. ""If they can score four goals, we can score six. Infinite things can happen,"" maintained Enrique, setting the stage for an extraordinary 6-1 comeback win.While Emery soon made his way out, the 'chokers tag' became ingrained in the club's identity. PSG never really managed to overcome the horrors of that night at Camp Nou, surrendering the momentum yet again in the 2018-19 edition of the Champions League. The French club pulled off a 2-0 win against Manchester United at Old Trafford in the first leg of their quarter-final.However, PSG again failed to get the job done in the second leg, losing 1-3 and crashing out. Even the presence of Neymar, who was signed from Barcelona for a record sum, as well as Kylian Mbappe, proved insufficient.While PSG's fortunes in the Champions League did improve over the years, reaching the tournament's final in the 2019-20 edition, inability to hold on under pressure stood out like a sore thumb. Mbappe and Neymar failed to convert chances as Bayern Munich pulled off a clinical win. While PSG owner Nasser Al-Khelaifi had made the club's desire to win the Champions League amply clear, fortune simply failed to swing in their favour despite the addition of Lionel Messi.PSG's tendency to commit harakiri remained constant in the 2021/22 edition, especially during their Round of 16 match against Real Madrid. The French club leaked three goals in 17 minutes, crashing out of the competition following a 2-3 loss on aggregate.As the managerial merry-go-round continued, Khelaifi took a drastic and controversial decision by appointing Enrique as the manager at the start of the 2023/24 season. The move was certainly unpopular among the PSG fans, considering the Spaniard's 'persona non grata' status after the pain he had subjected them to. Well, who can begrudge unwillingness to face your worst nightmare on a daily basis?Enrique stamped his philosophy from the first day itself, terming the situation at PSG ""chaotic"" and shocking. While managers had previously been quite cautious while dealing with Mbappe, the Spaniard openly highlighted his lack of desire to defend. ""A little bit more normalcy does no harm,” said Enrique.There was complete focus on work rate, with players dropped irrespective of their profile in case of any drop in standards. While players and agents earlier attempted to manipulate the manager through external pressure, none of that worked in this case, as Enrique strongly went about his philosophy. Young talents like Willian Pacho, Desire Doue, Bradley Barcola, and Vitinha made their way in as PSG shifted their focus from the biggest names to building a strong core.The Spaniard won over fans by giving Barcelona a taste of their own medicine in the 2023/24 quarter-finals. PSG overturned a 2-3 deficit by recording a comprehensive 4-1 win in the second leg, as the Parisians pulled off their own 'La Remontada'. However, there was more work in store for Enrique as he soon realised following a 2-0 loss on aggregate against Borussia Dortmund in the semi-finals. PSG hit the woodwork six times but failed to score a single goal.There was further an unexpected blow in store for Enrique as Mbappe forced a move to Real Madrid, depriving the Parisians of their top goal-scorer. While other managers would've been perturbed, the former Barcelona manager remained nonplussed. ""Our game does not consist in letting Mbappé do what he wants. That was the old philosophy which never won a major trophy. We are better in attack without him,"" he said.While such strong words could have made him a laughing stock, Enrique went about rebuilding with gusto, building a strong setup around attackers Ousmane Dembele, Goncalo Ramos and Doué. Dembele found his feet after being sidelined at Barcelona, scoring 33 goals in 45 matches this season. While PSG reached the Champions League 2024/25 final against Inter Milan, who'd been beaten only once the entire season, naysayers predicted them to perish yet again.However, Enrique's side showcased a strong display of intent, recording the biggest win in a Champions League final with five goals. PSG finally managed to win the Champions League for the first time, pulling off a feat which had seemed jinxed at one stage. Doue chipped in with a brace while another young prospect Senny Mayulu scored the final goal, showcasing the wealth of talent in PSG's kitty.

Poll Should Inter Milan retain manager Simone Inzaghi after the Champions League final loss? Yes, he deserves more time No, it's time for a change





""We are meeting with the coach because this club is not used to letting a manager go into the final year of his contract. There is no revolution underway. We will meet to hear what he has to say, I repeat, on our part, we are very proud and honoured to continue with him,"" he said.Inter suffered a devastating loss at the hands of Paris Saint-Germain in the final of the UEFA Champions League on Saturday at the Allianz Arena in Munich. The Parisiens put five past the Italian giants in a heavily one-sided final, as the Nerazzurri looked helpless against a relentless PSG onslaught.Following the result, Italian media reported that Inzaghi could depart as early as this month, ahead of the Club World Cup in the United States, scheduled from June 14 to July 13. However, Inter Milan president Giuseppe Marotta has confirmed the club wants to retain the manager despite Saturday's result, with discussions set to begin this week. Inzaghi's contract with the club expires next year in June.PSG claimed their first-ever Champions League title with the largest winning margin ever seen in a final. On the other hand, Inzaghi's Inter fell in the final once again, with the score line far worse than the 1-0 loss to Pep Guardiola's Manchester City in Istanbul in 2023.""This defeat will not have an impact. Inzaghi has a contract for another year and we had already decided to meet with him this week,"" Marotta told reporters after the match in Munich. ""Almost all the credit for this positive cycle is due to his professionalism and abilities. If he wants to continue, we are happy.""Inter staged an inspirational run to the final of the Champions League, and were in the running for an iconic treble up until a little over a month ago. However, a late slip up in Serie A and loss to AC Milan in the semi-final of the Coppa Italia means that Inter will now end the season trophyless.""We are meeting with the coach because this club is not used to letting a manager go into the final year of his contract. There is no revolution underway. We will meet to hear what he has to say, I repeat, on our part, we are very proud and honoured to continue with him,"" he said.Looking to put the difficult result behind them, the president said, ""Let's quickly forget and look to the next one, with the new start of the Club World Cup. We will be representing Italy together with Juventus.""","Inter Milan president Giuseppe Marotta confirms the club wants to retain manager Simone Inzaghi.

IPL 2025 Winner Prediction: What Greenstone Lobo's Astrology says

Poll Should Inter Kashi continue their appeal at the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS)? Yes, they deserve another hearing. No, the decision should stand.





The I-League title race has taken another turn after the AIFF appeals committee adjudged that Inter Kashi fielded an ineligible player for multiple games in the second leg of the competition.The appeals committee heard an appeal from Churchill Brothers, Namdhari FC and Real Kashmir, and ruled that the re-registration of Mario Barco by Inter Kashi made him an ineligible player. “The rules do not provide for re-registration for anyone who has been ousted from the season due to a season ending injury/illness,” chairperson of appeals committee Rajesh Tandon said in the order on Saturday.The appeals committee had earlier rejected Kashi’s plea against Namdhari fielding an ineligible player to announce Churchill as champions. Kashi have challenged the decision at the Lausanne-based Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) where the matter is expected to be decided later this month.In the provisional standings, Churchill had 40 points, a point more than Kashi, while Real Kashmir were third with 37 points. The appeals committee order means Kashi’s games where Mario was fielded would result in forfeiture. Churchill will now get two additional points, taking their points tally to an unassailable 42, regardless of the pending appeal before CAS.“Churchill Brothers, with 42 points, are the undisputed champions,” Churchill said on Tuesday. “After this order, Churchill’s championship win has been affirmed. The I-League trophy will continue to be in Goa. Churchill Brothers are grateful to the judicial bodies as they have rightfully upheld our legitimate claims.”Kashi said they would appeal against the judgement at CAS, just like they have done with the previous order where three points allotted to them by the disciplinary committee were returned to Namdhari by the appeals committee.“While it is unfortunate that Inter Kashi has to approach CAS yet again for a truly free and fair hearing of the matter, it seems to be the new reality of Indian football. The club is flabbergasted that such simple rules and regulations can be twisted and misinterpreted in such a manner through which the club is now suffering without any fault of its own,” Kashi said in a statement.Records suggest that Mario was part of Kashi’s initial squad – which included six foreigners -- for the I-League but was later replaced by Matija Babovic due to what was seen as a season-ending injury. The Spanish striker, however, continued to remain contracted with the club and made a return to the team on Feb 26, 2025 since Julen Perez’s contract termination during the January transfer window left a vacant foreign spot.According to the order, the federation’s competitions department disallowed Kashi from re-registering Mario on Feb 2, insisting that the request did not comply with clause 6.5.7 of the I-League regulations which states that a foreign player can only be replaced by another foreign player in case an injury or illness prevents the player from continuing to play for the rest of the competition or after mutual termination of the contract.Kashi appealed the decision with the AIFF League Committee which said on Feb 15 that a majority of its members were in favour of approving the club's request to add back player Mario Barco.Kashi fielded Mario for their games starting Feb 26 against Rajasthan United.In its order, the appeals committee said there is no power of review available with the League Committee in I-League regulations. “A power not available in a statute cannot be exercised by a body which itself is a creature of the statute,” the order noted.“The unlawful inclusion of a foreign player provided Inter Kashi with an unfair advantage over other clubs adhering to the prescribed regulations,” stated the order. “Such a violation directly undermines the principles of fair play and the integrity of the I-League. Furthermore, not penalising such a violation would encourage resource-wealthy clubs to buy and rotate more foreign players in their squads. This would directly undermine the principles of equity and equal opportunities which has made the I-League one of the most renowned football leagues of this country till now. ”",Churchill Brothers will be allotted two additional points after Inter Kashi fielded ‘ineligible’ Mario Barco in their draw against the former champions at Raia Panaji.

These include their 4-0 wins against Barcelona in 1993/94 and Steaua Bucuresti in 1988/89, plus a 4-1 victory over Ajax in 1968/69.The previous record for the largest margin of victory in a Champions League final was shared by multiple teams.

Paris Saint-Germain won their first-ever Champions League title with a historic 5-0 victory over Inter Milan in Munich on Saturday. Teenager Desire Doue scored twice, while Achraf Hakimi, Khvicha Kvaratskhelia, and substitute Senny Mayulu added goals in what became the most one-sided final in the tournament's 70-year history.The French champions dominated from the start, with Doue setting up Hakimi for the opening goal in the 12th minute. Doue then scored his first goal in the 20th minute through a deflected shot.The teenager added his second goal after the hour mark, effectively sealing the victory before Kvaratskhelia and young substitute Mayulu completed the rout.""This means everything. It's our dream. It's incredible. The result is not by magic. I'm happy we did it like this,"" said PSG midfielder Vitinha.The victory marks a significant milestone for PSG, coming after more than a decade of investment from their Qatari owners and five years after their only previous final appearance, where they lost to Bayern Munich.PSG completed a domestic treble with this victory, becoming only the second French club to win Europe's premier competition after Marseille's triumph in 1993.For manager Luis Enrique, it represents his second Champions League title, following his 2015 success with Barcelona.""It was the objective since the start of last season to make history. I have felt a really strong connection with the players and the supporters,"" Luis Enrique told Canal Plus.This PSG team, rebuilt over the past two years following Kylian Mbappe's departure, has emerged as one of the competition's most impressive sides.Inter Milan, seeking their first Champions League title since 2010, failed to match PSG's intensity throughout the match.

Dembele and Vitinha combined to set up Doue for his second goal past goalkeeper Yann Sommer.Kvaratskhelia added the fourth goal in the 73rd minute after being released by Dembele.Nineteen-year-old Mayulu completed the scoring in the 86th minute, exchanging passes with Bradley Barcola before finding the net.The five-goal victory marked the first time a team had scored that many in a European Cup final since Benfica in 1962, cementing PSG's place in football history.","Paris Saint-Germain beat Inter Milan 5-0 in the Champions League final in Munich.

I was sitting at the back for a very long time; I was quite good on energy but I didn’t understand how the race was playing out. The team did a great job with the strategy because I came out of the pit lane in sixth so I thought, ‘now I can fight!’, but I need to look at the race after to understand a little bit better what’s actually happened. I was really struggling with energy on the last couple of laps so I did my best in the last few corners.

I felt like my balance wasn’t quite there and I really struggled with my rears, so it wasn’t enjoyable and it was very hard to keep the car on track. I was slow to be honest, but good enough for a podium – two cars from the team are on the podium so that’s always positive.”Talking about his third-place finish, he added, “I’m happy for Nick [Cassidy], he did a really good job, but we’ve got good points. Starting second and finishing third is not ideal – in the beginning I thought we had something, but then it was clear to me that I didn’t have the pace of the two cars in front, so it was all about bringing the podium home.”Antonio now stands third in the 2025 Formula E Driver Standings with 88 points.Taking to Instagram after the race, Antonio Felix Da Costa shared a picture of himself spraying champagne from the podium.

After the win, he said, “Amazing! A 1-2 for the team, I’m so happy. A real masterclass this race, I think the strategy, the pace, the execution, the moves – everything was nice. I knew when I put the overlap on Oli [Rowland] and had more energy, I just had to go and get my head down and try to be secure, which we managed.I’m extremely happy. It means a lot, especially after these last few weeks when momentum was not on our side. This weekend we certainly got it back! It’s been a lot of hard work and I’m very happy for the team.”Jean-Eric Vergne delivered an impressive performance by reaching the podium despite starting deep in the pack. However, he sustained an injury following a collision on his way to the finish line.Talking about the race and his strategy, Vergne said: “What a race! It’s been a rollercoaster. I left a little bit of my front wing in the last corner, I think a bit of my wrist as well – I was suffering the whole race, I really hurt it. Honestly I don’t know, I just went for it – I think we did the right call keeping the Attack Mode quite late. Everybody was attacking a lot and I thought that since everyone was doing that I should save a bit more energy and try to use it towards the end, and it paid off quite nicely. ”Also Read: Shanghai E-Prix 2025: DS celebrates double victory as Maximilian Gunther takes first, Jean-Eric Vergne second in Round 10, Taylor Barnard claims third The Formula E drivers now prepare for the second race of the Shanghai E-Prix.

After all, I have a game style that fits the surface very well. When the clay season starts, I feel my best and happiest.”Boisson’s forehand is heavy, built for the surface she hopes to reign on, it spun viciously through the light afternoon air, finding the lines. She had 18 winners on that flank in the match, running around her backhand and opening up the court, mixing it up with slices and taking the ball away from the American’s comfort zone.The home player broke on her second opportunity in the ninth game of the second set, and then backed it up by serving out the set at love. The 22-year-old struck decisively in the decider, converting on her fourth chance for a 5-4 lead before warding off four breakpoints and serving out the match. “In the third set Chatrier was full, it was incredible. Roland Garros is a dream and it’s a goal, so being in quarters is a step ahead. ”","Lois Boisson, ranked 361 in the world, beat Jessica Pegula in straight sets. The 22-year-old will play Mirra Andreeva in the quarterfinals. Boisson won her maiden WTA title on clay at Saint Malo last year.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121585099,imgsize-68508,width-400,resizemode-4/121585099.jpg"

Outside the Parc des Princes, home to the victorious Paris St-Germain side, is a banner that says ‘Ici c’est Paris’ this is Paris.It certainly felt that way these last 24-hours when some 50,000 fans made their way to Boulogne-Billancourt to watch on giant screens their beloved side battle for the Champions League title some 900 kms away in Munich. The mood carried through from Saturday night, as a city, rejoicing their thumping 5-0 verdict, awaited their team to make its way home, following a victory parade at the iconic Champs-Elysees.About 500 metres from Paris St-Germain’s 48000 seater stadium, is the stunning setting of Roland Garros – red clay, with picturesque show courts, including one Court Simonne-Mathieu which is surrounded by greenhouses displaying botanical collections – it is where the tennis tours convene for the second major of the year, the French Open which is at the half-way mark. The points are getting longer and the matches more intense.Yet, from across the road, the chants of spectators cheering their victorious team echoes across in the full-house of Court Philip Chatrier, where play begins at ‘quiet please, players are ready’. S’il vous plait.As sporting stories go, Roland Garros held its own in individual contests on Sunday, with a pair of stirring comeback wins scripted by Iga Swiatek, the four-time champion, and the No.13 seed Elina Svitolina.The Ukrainian battled back from 4-6, 1-4 against the fourth-seeded Italian Jasmine Paolini, saving three match points to score a 4-6, 7-6 (5), 6-1 win in two-hours and 24-minutes.World No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka survived A scare in the first set before battling past 16th-seed Amanda Anisimova 7-5, 6-3 to reach the quarterfinals.Paolini, 29, who produced a statement season last year, making successive major finals at Roland Garros and Wimbledon, had two match points in the tenth game and then another in the tie-break, as the 30-year-old mother of a two-year-old took it to her opponent.“I tried to stick to my game plan, stayed in the match, kept fighting, kept doing aggressive things on the court, to find opportunities to get back in the match,” said Svitolina, whose daughter Skai will be three in October. “Jasmine played really well in the first set, second set as well. We were really close. I knew that I had to try to give myself a chance to come back into the match and just leave it all there.”In the quarterfinals on Tuesday, Svitolina will go up against the 24-year-old Swiatek, who authored a dramatic comeback against Elena Rybakina.The Pole said in the 35-minute opening set, where the Kazakh dropped just two points on her first serve, she felt like she was playing world No.1 Jannik Sinner. Swiatek, who trailed by a set and was down 0-2 in the second, made some tactical changes to her play, stepping back on Rybakina’s serve. That gave the 24-year-old a couple of extra seconds, helping her work her way back to claim a 1-6, 6-3, 7-5 win.Rohan Bopanna and Czech Adam Pavlasek bowed out of the French Open men’s doubles third round on Sunday, falling 2-6, 6-7 (5) in 71-minutes to Finland’s Harri Helliovaara and Briton’s Henry Patten. Bopanna and Pavlasek, who fought back in the second set, nudged ahead on serve in the tiebreak to 5-4, but Helliovaara and Patten sealed a mini break on match point. Bopanna, who made the semi-finals here last year with Aussie Matthew Ebden, will see a dip in his rankings.He’s at No. 51 in the live rankings. Meanwhile, the pairing of Yuki Bhambri and Robert Galloway went down 4-6, 4-6 to the ninth seeded Americans Christian Harrison and Evan King in 77-minutes.India’s Manas Dhamne bowed out of the junior boys singles at Roland Garros, falling 5-7, 3-6 to Indian-American Ronit Karki in the first round on Sunday. Manas, 17, led 4-1, 30-0 in the first set, but saw his opponent wade right in, winning six of the next seven games to seal the set.The 1-hour 41-minute match was a high-quality affair, but the American displayed greater consistency and was sharper in working his way around the court. While both players pushed 190 kmph on their first serves, it was Manas who had greater purchase with pace, but Ronit, strong on the return, created a dozen breakpoint opportunities.","Rohan Bopanna, Yuki Bhambri knocked out of French Open.

Carlos Alcaraz, the defending champion at Roland Garros, displayed remarkable sportsmanship during his French Open fourth-round victory against Ben Shelton on Sunday, voluntarily conceding a point for an illegal shot that initially appeared to be a spectacular volley, leading to a 7-6 (8), 6-3, 4-6, 6-4 win.The incident occurred early in the second set when Shelton hit a passing shot beyond Alcaraz's reach at the net. Alcaraz's racket, which he had thrown, made contact with the ball and sent it back over the net.The chair umpire initially awarded the point to Alcaraz, but the second-seeded player approached the official to acknowledge that he wasn't holding his racket when it touched the ball, which is against the rules.The crowd on Court Philippe-Chatrier applauded Alcaraz's honest admission, and the point was awarded to Shelton, the 13th-seeded American.""It's a shame, because it was the 'Hot Shot' of the day,"" Alcaraz said later with a smile.""Crazy shot,"" Shelton remarked.""I thought, 'OK, I could not say anything.' But I would have felt guilty if I didn't say anything,"" Alcaraz explained later. ""It's just about if I know that I didn't [do], or I did, a wrong thing.... I have to say. I have to be honest with myself. I have to be honest with Ben, with everyone. ... It's just about the respect we have against each other, and I think that sports, in general, should be like this.""The moment came at a crucial point in the match, turning what would have been a 40-30 lead for Alcaraz into a break point opportunity for Shelton.Alcaraz managed to save that break point and five others in a 20-point game, eventually securing a two-set lead in the match between the two 22-year-old power hitters.""I thought it was clean, you know? I thought he hit the volley, and [then] the racket flew out of his hand,"" Shelton said. ""I was kind of surprised that he was, like, 'No, I let go of the racket and threw it.' ... Obviously a guy with a lot of sportsmanship.""","Carlos Alcaraz, the defending champion at Roland Garros, displayed remarkable sportsmanship.

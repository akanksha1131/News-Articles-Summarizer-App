FIFA-AFC puts India on notice; AIFF must adopt constitution by Oct 30 or face suspension,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/top-stories/fifa-afc-puts-india-on-notice-aiff-must-adopt-constitution-by-oct-30-or-face-suspension/articleshow/123535237.cms,"Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel.

PANAJI: The All India Football Federation (AIFF) is in danger of being suspended for the second time in three years if it fails to get its constitution ratified by October 30, according to a letter from FIFA, the governing body for world football, and the Asian Football Confederation (AFC).FIFA and AFC jointly sent a letter to AIFF president Kalyan Chaubey on Tuesday expressing ""profound concern” at the continued failure to finalise and implement the revised constitution, “a matter that has remained under consideration since proceedings before the Supreme Court of India in 2017.” Despite repeated assurances, the letter notes, “the absence of a clear and compliant governance framework has now created an untenable vacuum and legal uncertainties at the heart of Indian football. ”The letter has been signed by Elkhan Mammadov, FIFA’s chief member associations officer and Vahid Kardany, deputy general secretary, Member Associations, AFC.FIFA and AFC have given AIFF a deadline of October 30 to secure a definitive order from the Supreme Court approving the revised AIFF constitution, ensure full alignment with mandatory provisions of FIFA and AFC Statutes and regulations, and obtain formal ratification of the constitution at the next AIFF general body meeting.“Failure to meet this schedule will leave us with no alternative but to refer the matter to the relevant FIFA decision-making body for consideration and decision,” states the letter, reminding AIFF of its obligation to manage its affairs independently and without any undue third-party influence, including government bodies.Failure to adhere to this obligation, FIFA-AFC said, “may result in sanctions outlined in the FIFA and AFC Statutes, including the possibility of suspension.”A member association can face consequences for third-party influence, even if it is not directly at fault (cf. article 14 paragraph 3 of the FIFA Statutes and article 10 paragraph 1 (t) and 2 of the AFC Statutes). A suspension of the AIFF would result in the loss of all of its rights as a FIFA and AFC member, as defined in the FIFA and AFC Statutes.FIFA had suspended India on Aug 16, 2022, for third-party influence because a Supreme Court appointed committee of administrators was running the federation. The ban was lifted ten days later, paving the way for elections where Chaubey was elected as president.Chaubey has now been asked to present the FIFA-AFC letter to the Supreme Court and inform the Union ministry of sports and youth affairs. “AIFF must regard this communication as binding and requiring immediate compliance in order to safeguard its rights as a member of FIFA and AFC,” the letter states.The matter of the AIFF constitution has been in Supreme Court since 2017.The Supreme Court has said that its judgment in the case concerning is “ready” but has deferred pronouncement to ensure that it was “in sync” with the recently enacted National Sports Act.“From our side, the judgment is ready. We just kept it to have a look at what will be the implication of the Act on it,” a Bench of Justices P.S. Narasimha and Joymalya Bagchi observed.The case has been listed for hearing on August 28.","The All India Football Federation (AIFF) is in danger of being suspended for the second time in three years if it fails to get its constitution ratified. FIFA, the governing body for world football, and the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) jointly sent a letter to AIFF president Kalyan Chaubey on Tuesday.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123535257,imgsize-16334,width-400,resizemode-4/123535257.jpg"

Poll Will Jannik Sinner successfully defend his US Open title? Yes No

Flushing Meadows witnessed a blockbuster Tuesday as defending champion Jannik Sinner opened his campaign for back-to-back US Open titles, while former winners Iga Swiatek and Coco Gauff also got their bids for glory underway.World number one Sinner headlined day three action on Arthur Ashe Stadium, easing past unseeded Czech Vit Kopriva in straight sets. The Italian, who has already lifted the Australian Open and Wimbledon crowns this year while finishing runner-up at Roland Garros, is chasing a slice of history in New York. If successful, the 24-year-old will become the first man since Roger Federer in 2008 to retain the title.Sinner’s preparations had been hampered by illness that forced him to retire from the Cincinnati Open final against Carlos Alcaraz earlier this month. Yet the top seed looked sharp on return, insisting his focus is fully on the fortnight ahead after overcoming an early-season doping controversy. “I feel like it’s over. We are focusing on hard work again and trying to get better as an athlete,” Sinner said.In the women’s draw, 2022 champion Swiatek cruised past Colombia’s Emiliana Arango in her opener.Once labelled a clay-court specialist, the Polish star has added layers to her game in 2025, proving her adaptability on faster surfaces. Victories at Wimbledon and in Cincinnati underline her credentials, and she will be among the frontrunners at Flushing Meadows.Home favourite Gauff, the former US Open champion, also delighted fans in the night session. The third seed overcame Australia’s Ajla Tomljanovic under the lights on Ashe, kick-starting her quest to recapture the title she memorably captured in 2023.Elsewhere, world number two Carlos Alcaraz, who could be Sinner’s biggest threat once more, began his campaign on Monday with a straight-sets win over American Reilly Opelka.",Defending champion Jannik Sinner eased past Czech Vit Kopriva in straight sets.

Poll Who do you think will win the women's singles semifinal between Anahat Singh and Tanvi Khanna? Anahat Singh Tanvi Khanna

Anahat Singh carries the confidence of someone far beyond her age on the squash court. Her game retains the freshness and flair of a teenager unburdened by convention. The 17-year-old is already crafting an identity of her own, a style that makes squash look less like a test of attrition and more a canvas for creativity.At first glance, what stands out is her court coverage. She glides rather than scrambles, her movements purposeful and measured, finding the ball early and buying herself critical milliseconds to shape her shots. This composure at the backcourt becomes the platform where she builds points with imagination. Her drop shots, for example, carry the silky disguise of a touch artist — delivered at the last instant.And then, when defenders adjust, she surprises them with crisp length that clings to the side wall, turning defence into attack with a flick of her wrist. A sudden crosscourt nick, a delicate lob played under pressure, or a deceptive hold that pauses her shot for half a beat longer than expected. These elements create a sense of unpredictability around her.Tamil Nadu’s Pooja Arthi, Anahat’s women’s singles quarterfinal opponent at the HCL 81st National Squash Championships 2025, often found herself at wits end as the Delhi girl showcased her superior tactical awareness to cruise to the semifinals with a 11-3, 11-0, 11-2 straight games victory at the Major Dhyan Chand National Stadium here on Tuesday.“Happy with the way I played. I don’t get to play on these courts much. This is a new venue for me. I generally train at Siri Fort Stadium and there is also a makeshift court at our house. The semis would definitely be tougher,” Anahat said after her match.Top seed Anahat will take on fellow Delhi girl Tanvi Khanna in the semis. Tanvi beat Sanya Vats 11-7, 11-8 (retd). Sanya looked to be fighting well against Tanvi, but retired after two games.The other semifinal will see veteran Joshna Chinappa , representing Tamil Nadu, face second seed Akanksha Salunkhe of Goa.Joshna was in a spot of bother when she lost the second game, but then upped the ante to beat Unnati Tripathi of UP 11-4, 8-11, 11-4, 11-4 in her quarterfinal encounter. Joshna has a record 18 national titles to her credit, and was ranked in the top-10 in the world in her prime.In the men’s section, second seed Velavan Senthilkumar of Tamil Nadu managed to put it across Goa’s Yash Fadte 11-6, 11-6, 11-8. Abhay Singh, Ramit Tandon and Veer Chotrani also made it to the semifinals.","Top seed Anahat Singh will take on fellow Delhi girl Tanvi Khanna in the semis.

World No. 2 Iga Swiatek stormed into the second round of the US Open on Tuesday with a commanding 6-1, 6-2 victory over Colombia’s Emiliana Arango — but it was Taylor Swift ’s engagement to NFL star Travis Kelce that dominated her post-match spotlight.The Polish star, a self-confessed “Swiftie,” barely had time to leave Arthur Ashe Stadium before news of the pop icon’s engagement swept through Flushing Meadows. For Swiatek, the update was as thrilling as her own record-breaking performance, which saw her notch a 65th consecutive first-round win at WTA-level events, surpassing Monica Seles’ historic mark.""I’m just happy for her, because she deserves the best,"" Swiatek told reporters, her face lighting up at the mention of Swift. ""Obviously she had a lot of boyfriends, so we know all about that. Hopefully this one will stick forever. Travis seems like a great guy. She seems super happy, so I’m happy for her. I wish them all the best.""Swiatek’s devotion to Swift runs deep. The 24-year-old has often credited the singer’s music with helping her learn English and cope with the challenges of adolescence. After her French Open triumph in 2023, she even attended Swift’s ‘Eras Tour’ concert in Liverpool — a win that earned her a handwritten note from Swift herself.Revealing her journey as a fan since 2014, Swiatek said: ""I just followed everything. I was following her, but also fan pages to see the updates. When the Reputation album came out, I’ve got to say I didn’t really like it that much. So I had a little break. But then in 2019, and when Folklore and Evermore were released during Covid, I started listening to Taylor again. It’s great. But I like Reputation now. Don’t worry.""She also hit back at Swift’s detractors, insisting: ""I don’t get it, because she just makes our world better.""So intense was the focus on Swift that when one reporter requested to move on to a ""non-Taylor question,"" Swiatek playfully retorted: ""No.""The six-time Grand Slam champion now turns her attention back to tennis, with a second-round clash against the Netherlands’ Suzan Lamens.","World No. 2 Iga Swiatek is a self-confessed 'Swiftie' The Polish star beat Emiliana Arango 6-1, 6-2 in the first round of the US Open.

The second day at the Billie Jean King National Tennis Center features Alcaraz as one of the main attractions during the night session at Arthur Ashe Stadium.Alcaraz, the Spanish champion seeking his second US Open victory after his first Grand Slam win in 2022, will face American Reilly Opelka in the opening round.The 22-year-old second seed could potentially meet Jannik Sinner, whom he has already faced twice in Grand Slam finals this season.Alcaraz arrived at the US Open on Monday sporting a newly shaved head for his first-round match.The second-seeded player created interest with his new haircut before his match against Opelka at Arthur Ashe Stadium.Watch:During his arrival at the tournament grounds, Alcaraz encountered golf star Rory McIlroy, who touched his shaved head.

A lighthearted clip, posted by FIDE (the governing body for chess) across their social media platforms, has gone viral after India’s Divya Deshmukh, the 2025 Women’s World Cup champion, was asked which chess rule she would like to change.With a cheeky smile, she replied: “No jeans!” before bursting into laughter, a playful nod to one of the most memorable controversies in recent chess history.Watch:Her answer immediately evoked memories of world No. 1 Magnus Carlsen ’s infamous jeans incident at the 2024 World Rapid Championship in New York.Carlsen had been told by arbiters to swap his size-32 Corneliani jeans for more formal attire in line with the tournament’s dress code.Instead, he refused, accepted a $200 fine, and ultimately forfeited his final round of the day.The bold stance sparked a storm of debate over how much freedom players should have in expressing themselves during competition.Far from fading, the jeans episode has only grown in legend.Earlier this year, the very same pair was auctioned in collaboration with Chess.com, drawing enormous global attention. Initially stuck at $14,100, the bidding exploded in the final 30 minutes, with 29 rapid-fire bids pushing the price up to an astonishing $36,100, all of which Carlsen pledged to donate to charity.The winning bidder, who remains anonymous, also paid $74 in shipping for what is now one of the most famous garments in the chess world.From a rule dispute to a charitable milestone, Carlsen’s jeans have become a quirky yet powerful symbol in chess, and Divya Deshmukh’s playful “no jeans” answer shows the story still resonates in the sport’s culture.",Divya Deshmukh was asked which chess rule she would like to change.

Poll How would you describe Rajeev Kumar's influence on the team? A vital contributor An unsung hero

The Board of Control for Cricket in India ( BCCI ) has parted ways with long-serving team masseur Rajeev Kumar , bringing an end to his nearly decade-long association with the national side.Kumar, a familiar face around the Indian dressing room, confirmed his exit with a heartfelt message on Instagram: “It has been a privilege and honour to serve the Indian cricket team for a decade (2006–2015). Thank you, God, for the opportunity, truly grateful and looking forward!”For players and fans alike, Kumar was more than just support staff.Always seen with his trademark smile, he became an ever-present figure at the boundary ropes during matches, ready to step in when needed.Once the day’s play was done, he was often the first person the players turned to, working tirelessly to ease stiff muscles and help them recover quickly.His duties went beyond massage therapy, he also prepared energy drinks, protein shakes, and hydration mixes, tailored to each player’s needs.His presence on the field was equally significant, as he was part of the crew stationed at the ropes to collect wayward balls, ensuring players remained fresh and over rates were kept under control.Kumar’s rapport with the seamers was particularly strong, given their physically demanding spells.His popularity reached fans too when Mohammed Shami posted a birthday photo with him and Ishant Sharma in 2019, showcasing their camaraderie. Yuzvendra Chahal once called Kumar and other staff the “unsung heroes” who helped cricketers perform at their best.Kumar’s departure comes amid a wider reshuffle in the Indian team’s support system, which has also seen Abhishek Nayar , Arun Kanade, and Soham Desai move on, while fielding coach T. Dilip briefly exited before being reinstated.With Rajeev Kumar’s exit, Indian cricket says goodbye to one of its most trusted behind-the-scenes contributors, an individual whose quiet dedication helped shape countless victories.","Rajeev Kumar has left the Indian cricket team.

Shubman Gill not fit to lead in all three formats | Greenstone Lobo predicts

NEW DELHI: Reflecting on his Test career, which he ended earlier this year, former India captain Rohit Sharma said on Monday that the format is both ""challenging and draining,"" but he learned to handle its demands through preparation.The 38-year-old, who scored 4,301 runs at an average of 40.58 in 67 Tests, retired from the five-day game in May, a year after stepping away from T20 internationals following India’s World Cup triumph under his captaincy.Speaking at a CEAT event during a panel discussion on preparation for big moments, Rohit said: ""It is something that you prepare for, because the game demands longevity. Especially in the Test format, you have to last for five days. Mentally, it is very challenging and it is draining as well. But all cricketers have been brought up playing First-Class cricket. When we start playing cricket at a competitive level, even in Mumbai, club cricket (matches) go on for two days (or) three days so we are built like that and it starts at a very young age for us. It kind of makes it a little easier how to respond to situations that are there in front of you.""Rohit admitted that young players may not immediately realise the importance of preparation, but it grows on them as they progress.""...when I started playing the sport, it was all about having fun, enjoying (it). As you go on, you start playing age group cricket and you kind of keep moving forward from that. Slowly, as you meet a lot of senior players (and) coaches, they talk about how important it is to prepare well. When you are very young, you don't understand the importance of preparation. But as you go along, you understand, it gives you a kind of discipline that the game asks for, so it starts with preparation, understanding what exactly you need to do. ""Highlighting Test cricket’s demands, Rohit stressed that sustaining performance begins with being mentally fresh.""It takes a lot when you're playing the longest format and concentration is something that is the key, because you are speaking about high level performance and when you are expecting to put in high level performance, it starts with being mentally fresh all the time. A lot of work starts behind the scenes. Like I said, in preparation. I have to go back again to that because that is where it all starts. You prepare yourself to sustain for the longer period of time on the field. ""He explained that preparation became a central part of his game once he started playing for Mumbai and later India.""It exactly happened to the same (way) with me, when I started playing for Mumbai and then went on to play for India. A lot of the focus, a lot of my time was given (on) how I prepped before the game. Because once the game starts, it's all about reaction and you react to whatever is thrown at you, whether it is a pressure situation, whether it is making the right decision on the field with the bat or with the ball. A lot of time was devoted to prep and I'm sure it's not just in cricket, but anywhere, whatever you do with life, I think preparation is the key.

Former India cricketer Manoj Tiwary has made a scathing remark on head coach Gautam Gambhir , calling him a ""hypocrite"" for playing against Pakistan in the upcoming 2025 Asia Cup.The eight-team ACC Asia Cup T20I tournament will be staged in Abu Dhabi and Dubai from September 9 to 28.

What will he do now? He's the coach of the team that's going to play Pakistan in the Asia Cup. Why can't he just resign and say that I will not be part of Team India because you are playing with Pakistan?""Tiwary also questioned Gambhir for not picking Yashasvi Jaiswal in the Asia Cup squad.“He (Gambhir) was the one who said that Yashasvi Jaiswal is one of the players who is the future of Team India, and also someone who should not be kept out of T20 cricket. He should be given a longer run. And now, he's not there in the team,” Tiwary said.“So, apart from these couple of statements, there are many things he said and then did the exact opposite.

CHENNAI: Pacer Tushar Deshpande made his India debut in the T20I series in Zimbabwe in July last year but went out of reckoning immediately after. An ankle injury sidelined him for most of the domestic season, before the 30-year-old made his comeback with Rajasthan Royals in the IPL.He had an inconsistent run in the IPL season and later played a solitary match for India ‘A’ during the tour of England. “The recovery took longer than I expected. The aspiration to play Test cricket for India is always there. I am taking it one match at a time and following the process, focusing on staying fit because I lost considerable time last year. I am just keeping myself fit so that I can put in the hard yards for Mumbai and be ready whenever the selectors feel I am prepared to play for India,” Tushar, who is currently playing in the Buchi Babu red-ball tournament, said.Tushar has been selected to play for West Zone in the season-opening Duleep Trophy, and a solid performance there could help him retain his spot in the India ‘A’ squad. Australia ‘A’ is set to tour India in September and October. “Going into Duleep Trophy with an open mind will help me. That is what I have always done, and it has helped me in the way I bowl. Any challenge which comes up, I am ready for it.”The Mumbai pacer received guidance from NCoE bowling coach Troy Cooley as he prepared for the demands of red-ball cricket during the recent camp in Bengaluru.“Troy’s input has been valuable, especially regarding workload management for the multi-day format. If you look at it, in a four-day match, a fast bowler needs to bowl around 30-35 overs with good intensity. We worked on that for a week; how to manage those 35 overs across the two innings. ”Apart from his bowling exploits, Tushar’s batting has been invaluable for Mumbai in the lower-order for the past few years. Coming in at No. 11, he scored a century in the quarterfinal against Baroda and helped his side advance to the semifinals in the 2023–24 season. Two years ago, Tushar took his father’s advice to be patient with his batting, and that has brought him great rewards.“I started my career as a batter, and batting comes naturally to me. Whenever I have had the chance to bat, I have scored runs. I feel that if I can contribute with the bat to any team that I play for, it will be a bonus.

NEW DELHI: Sachin Tendulkar is celebrated as one of the greatest batters in cricket history, but his bowling remains an often-overlooked part of his game. Though never a frontline bowler, Tendulkar’s versatility made him a valuable part-time option. He could bowl medium pace, off-spin, and leg-spin, often stepping in to break stubborn partnerships or give the main bowlers a breather.In Tests, Tendulkar claimed 46 wickets across 200 matches. While his bowling role was limited, he still produced memorable spells, with best figures of 3/10.During a Reddit Ask Me Anything (AMA) session, a fan asked him: “Hi Sachin, what’s the favorite wicket that you’ve ever taken (while bowling)?” Tendulkar’s reply was short and telling: “Moin Khan… last ball of the day.”The wicket came in the 2004 Multan Test, remembered primarily for Virender Sehwag’s historic 309, which made him the first Indian to score a triple century in Tests and earned him the nickname “Multan ka Sultan.” The game is also etched in memory for Rahul Dravid’s declaration when Tendulkar was unbeaten on 194 — though that is another story.After India piled up 675/5, Pakistan’s resistance rested on Abdul Razzaq and Moin Khan , with the hosts five down. Tendulkar was handed the final over of Day 3.Employing clever tactics, he deliberately pushed fielders back to allow Razzaq a single, ensuring the nervous Moin Khan would face the strike. What followed was pure genius. Tendulkar bowled a deceptive googly that slipped through Moin’s defense and crashed into the stumps.A stunned Moin walked back as India capped the day perfectly. The visitors eventually won the Test by an innings and 52 runs, but for Tendulkar, that single dismissal remains one of his most cherished bowling moments.",Sachin Tendulkar has revealed his favorite wicket while bowling. The India legend took the wicket of Moin Khan in the 2004 Multan Test. The wicket was taken on the final ball of the day as India won by 52 runs. The match is remembered for Virender Sehwag's historic 309.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123530497,imgsize-42210,width-400,resizemode-4/123530497.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Hanuma Vihari , remembered more for his heroic rearguard effort against Australia at the SCG in 2021 than even his series-topping 289 runs in the West Indies in 2019, has decided to make a fresh start in domestic cricket. The 30-year-old middle-order batter will leave Andhra Pradesh and represent Tripura in the 2025-26 season across formats.Confirming the move, Vihari released a statement on social media.“After thoughtful consideration, I have made the decision to move to the Tripura Cricket Association, where I’ll be representing the state in all three formats of the game. While I’m grateful to the Andhra Cricket Association for the role they’ve played in my journey so far, I believe it’s time for a platform that aligns better with my aspirations and allows me to contribute consistently across formats. Excited for this fresh challenge and fully committed to giving my best in this next phase,” he wrote.Vihari last played a Test for India in 2022 but has remained on the fringes since. After the 2023-24 domestic season, he openly accused the Andhra Cricket Association of favouritism and expressed his desire to move elsewhere. His wish finally materialised this season with the Tripura switch.The Hyderabad-born cricketer made his Test debut in 2018 at The Oval, scoring a half-century against England. But it was in Sydney in January 2021 that Vihari etched his name into Indian cricket folklore. Battling a hamstring injury, he produced a dogged unbeaten 23 off 161 balls, sharing a marathon partnership with the now-retired R Ashwin . The effort helped India salvage a draw after being set a daunting 407, before the visitors sealed a historic series win at Brisbane.In 16 Tests, Vihari has scored 839 runs at an average of 33.56, with 111 being his highest score. His domestic record is even more formidable, with over 9,500 runs in 131 first-class matches at 49.92, including 24 centuries and a highest score of 302.As he begins a new chapter with Tripura, Vihari will hope the move brings consistency and renewed opportunities in his cricketing journey.",Hanuma Vihari will represent Tripura in the 2025-26 season across formats.

Sunil Gavaskar pays emotional tribute to his departed friends and teammates at annual party,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/a-tribute-for-his-departed-friends-and-teammates-at-sunil-gavaskars-annual-party/articleshow/123528775.cms,"Sunil Gavaskar

MUMBAI: Cricket legend Sunil Gavaskar 's annual party, postponed after being initially planned in May because of a war-like situation between India and Pakistan, finally happened at the Mumbai Cricket Association's Bandra-Kurla Complex Recreation Club on Sunday night. Incidentally, it turned out to be the same day when India's Test batting stalwart Cheteshwar Pujara announced his retirement from cricket.Just a day earlier (on Aug 23), Gavaskar and former ICC, BCCI , and MCA Fraser Sharad Pawar had unveiled a statue of himself at the entrance of the MCA's Sharad Pawar Cricket Museum.Gavaskar's fierce patriotism came to the fore when the invitation card itself mentioned that the party was being held to ""celebrate the success of Operation Sindoor and the performance of the Indian cricket team in England, which has won the hearts of all Indians."" Operation Sindoor was India's substantial response to Pakistan in the wake of the Pahalgam attacks on April 22. While led by a young, debutant captain in Shubman Gill, India, against all expectations, drew a hard-fought series against England 2-2 while playing some thoroughly entertaining and magnificent cricket.On the occasion, Gavaskar didn't forget to remember his old childhood friends who had departed and were a regular feature at his annual party.At the entrance of the hall, Gavaskar remembered all his childhood friends and former Mumbai teammates Milind Rege, Ehsan Hakim, Vijay Karkhanis, Padmakar Shivalkar, Abdul Ismail and his India teammate Dilip Doshi, with their names inscribed on miniature bats.Present on the occasion was former India captain Nari Contractor, who is 91 now. However, three other cricketers of yesteryear who are all in their 90s — ex-India allrounder Chandu Borde, ex-India ‘keeper Chandu Patankar, and former Rajasthan leg-spinner Chandu Joshi — couldn’t make it due to health reasons. Apparently, Joshi started off from Pune for the party, but had to return from Lonavala as he wasn’t feeling well.The guests at the do included Dilip Vengsarkar, India's 1983 World Cup heroes Sandeep Patil and Balwinder Singh Sandhu, former India wicketkeeper and ex-Kolkata Knight Riders and current Madhya Pradesh head coach Chandrakant Pandit, ex-India players Pravin Amre, Raju Kulkarni, Yajurvindra Singh Bilkha and Jatin Paranjape. Ex-India seamer-turned-commentator Irfan Pathan's presence attracted eyeballs too.In a video message, Gavaskar said, “What a wonderful last 10 days it has been! On August 15, which was our 78th Independence Day, it also happened to be my mother's 100th birth anniversary. Our family got together, it was such a fun evening. I'm pretty certain that my parents, my mother, looking from the heavens above, would have also had fun seeing practically the whole family get together to celebrate her 100th birthday. ”“And then a few days later, my statue was unveiled at the Wankhede Stadium, something which I had not even dreamt of when I started playing cricket in the Bhagirathi buildings. And the day after that, we got together to celebrate Operation Sindoor and the young Indian team's performance in England. It was the annual get-together that I generally have for all those whom I have played with right from school, college, club, and Ranji Trophy level, so it was also such a wonderful evening. I can't be thankful enough to God almighty to have the opportunity to have a get-together and celebrate all three occasions with all my family and friends. Normally, it is Milind and Anil Joshi (Gavaskar’s old friend) who organise everything, but this time I’m thankful to Anil for organising the party. We missed Milind Rege, Abdul bhai Ismail, my skipper ‘Papa’ Karkhanis, ‘Paddy’ Shivalkar, and Dilip Doshi. We also missed some others who couldn’t make it.”As usual, Gavaskar's party didn't have any speeches or loud music, just some precious anecdotes that went perfectly with the alcohol and some highly delicious food that was served right through the evening.","Cricket legend Sunil Gavaskar's annual party finally happened on Sunday night.

Poll Should Devdutt Padikkal have gone for the century instead of taking the single? Yes, he should have gone for it It doesn't matter, the team won

Devdutt Padikkal fell agonisingly short of a century but still produced a match-winning innings as Hubli Tigers secured a thumping win over Mangalore Dragons in the Karnataka Premier League on Tuesday.Opening the innings as captain, Padikkal was in commanding touch from the outset. The 25-year-old carved boundaries at will, striking ten fours and five sixes in a dominant display that left the opposition bowlers with no answers.With a century in sight, the left-hander ran out of time. On the penultimate delivery of the innings, he chose to take a single, moving to 99. His partner Manvanth Kumar then cleared the ropes off the final ball, leaving Padikkal stranded one run short of the milestone.Despite the missed personal landmark, the effort was enough to set up a huge total. Hubli Tigers later bundled out Mangalore Dragons for just 100, sealing victory by 110 runs in one of the most one-sided contests of the tournament so far.The innings also came as a timely reminder of Padikkal’s ability. After managing only 247 runs in 10 matches during Royal Challengers Bengaluru’s title-winning IPL 2025 campaign, the left-hander’s KPL performance offered fans a glimpse of his best form.Social media was quick to hail his unbeaten 99, with clips of his elegant strokes and clean hitting widely shared.For Padikkal, the century may have slipped away, but his near-perfect knock was enough to underline his value as both leader and batter for the Hubli Tigers.",Devdutt Padikkal scored an unbeaten 99 in Hubli Tigers' win over Mangalore Dragons in the Karnataka Premier League on Tuesday.

What Sachin Tendulkar said on not having a century at Lord's

NEW DELHI: Former Indian cricketer Sachin Tendulkar fielded a wide range of questions from fans during a Q&A session on the social media platform Reddit. When one fan asked him who was the toughest to run with between the wickets, Tendulkar named Virender Sehwag , explaining that Sehwag mostly dealt in boundaries.Tendulkar and Sehwag formed one of India’s most successful opening pairs in limited-overs cricket. Statistically, they are fourth on India’s list of highest run-scoring ODI partnerships, with 4,387 runs in 112 innings at an average of 39.16, including 13 century stands and 18 fifty-plus partnerships.The fan’s question was: ""Hi Sachin Sir, Big fan of your's from Patna, Bihar. My Ques is - With which batsman, you found running between the wickets toughest and easiest respectively?""To this, Tendulkar replied: ""Viru ko bhagana mushkil hi nahi namumkin tha kyunki woh chakkon aur chaukon mein deal karta tha!"" (To make Viru run was not only difficult but impossible because he would only deal in sixes and fours.)Sachin Tendulkar, widely regarded as one of cricket’s greatest batters, built a career defined by remarkable consistency and longevity.In Test cricket, he played 200 matches, scoring 15,921 runs at an average of 53.78, with 51 centuries, 68 fifties, a highest score of 248 not out, and 115 catches.In ODIs, his numbers were equally staggering: 463 matches, 18,426 runs, an average of 44.83, and a strike rate of 86.23. He scored 49 centuries, including the first-ever men’s ODI double hundred (*200), along with over 2,000 fours and 195 sixes. Tendulkar remains the only cricketer with 100 international centuries, a record that cements his place in history.","Former Indian cricketer Sachin Tendulkar fielded a wide range of questions from fans during a Q&A session on the social media platform Reddit.

Guyana is banking on its rich cricket legacy - which produced players like Clive Lloyd, Rohan Kanhai, Shivnarine Chanderpaul, Ramnaresh Sarwan, Alvin Kallicharran - and strong fan support to become the next stop in the sport. The first step towards that objective was taken by launching the Cricket West Indies-backed Global Super League (GSL).The GSL has featured teams from the Caribbean Premier League, Australia's Sheffield Shield or Big Bash League, Bangladesh Premier League, England's Vitality Blast, New Zealand's Super Smash, Pakistan Super League and UAE's ILT20.""We are just a few hours away from the USA with huge Asian diaspora that are very cricket-oriented, whether that is Bangladesh, Pakistan, India, and then the natural West Indian diaspora. So we have decided to put in place an ecosystem to support cricket as a major plan of that sports tourism,"" said Guyanese President Dr. Mohamed Irfaan Ali.""On the economic side, we strongly believe that the product that we have launched - the Global Super League - is not meant to be in competition with any product. It is meant to be in partnership with all the different T20 products. That is why the Global Super League sought to, first of all, engage the ICC.In having the ICC understand what we want to achieve, and having the ICC on board.""In developing the Global Super League, we then went to all the major boards. And seek to involve the winners, just like what the (now defunct) Champions League (CLT20) did - the winners of the different T20 leagues. And to bring them into this format. But this format is not only about cricket. It is about cricket, it's about development, it's about entertainment, it's about culture.”CLT20, which was jointly owned by the BCCI, Cricket Australia and Cricket Australia, ran for six seasons before it was cancelled due to poor viewing figures, lack of audience interest and unstable sponsorship.Dr. Ali, however, believes GSL can be successful in the long run. ""In the first year, I believe it has ruffled enough feathers. And created enough news for people to understand this is a serious league. And this is a league powered by a small developing nation,"" he said.""It's a league that has not cut any corners. Or taken any shortcut to the level of professionalism and the quality of product that we want to achieve,"" he added.Dr. Ali admits that BCCI's involvement is important in making it bigger. The Indian cricket board has had a long-standing policy that does not allow active Indian players to participate in overseas T20 tournaments unless they retire from all Indian cricket, including the IPL and domestic formats.""India cannot be developing the level of talent that it is developing just for its borders. It's like boxing. You can't be a world champion if you only want to fight in your borders. And BCCI is doing an enormous disservice to the magnitude of talent that India has by not allowing participation in this league,"" he stressed.""This (the tournament) should not be seen a criticism or competition but as an opportunity. Because we want to partner with India. We are naturally part of the diaspora. And I believe that India itself, the BCCI, should have a Diaspora 11 even to start with. Because cricket is much more than a game. It's a cultural identity.""And I even raised this with Prime Minister (Narendra) Modi. That if you really want to reach out to the diaspora, which is a big part of his agenda. If you really want to integrate the diaspora in what you do, it has to be in every sphere of life. Not only political, economic, investment and trade. Culture and sports is the most impactful way in which you can integrate the diaspora.""Because if you have your talent coming down to play in the league. And you give them an opportunity also to be seen. India will have five (playing) XIs.""Dr. Ali said he will work on these matters following the Guyanese general elections on 1 September. He also urged the BCCI to champion the cause for smaller nations in not just furthering the sport but also with Olympics in three years time.""We're here to build a product that is beyond the ecosystem. We want to support what India is doing and what the ICC is doing. We have already engaged the West Indies board as part of this. We want to engage them to play a deeper part in this. And we want India to really reconsider this approach to the Champions League.""We're building. We're investing in the facilities here. We're investing to keep cricket alive in this part of the world. And if India really wants to make a breakthrough in this massive market that exists. Then they have a very natural partner in us.""Dr. Ali also pushed for a more collaborative approach between India and Guyana, going beyond cricket.""So we see cricket like India does. As having trade importance, business importance, economic importance, tourism importance, cultural importance. And also of course the game itself,"" he concluded.","Guyana is banking on its rich cricket legacy to become the next stop in the sport.

Poll Do you agree with Borussia Dortmund's decision to restrict access to the dressing room area? Yes, it's necessary for professionalism. No, families should have access.

Borussia Dortmund have tightened their post-match rules by barring players’ families from the dressing room area following an incident involving Jobe Bellingham’s father at the weekend.Mark Bellingham, who also advises his son, had flown in from England to watch the 19-year-old’s Bundesliga debut away at St. Pauli on Saturday. Jobe, signed from Sunderland in a £32 million move this summer, started the game but was taken off at half-time by coach Niko Kovac.According to reports in Germany, Mark Bellingham waited in the tunnel after full-time and questioned sporting director Sebastian Kehl about the decision. He was said to be upset both by his son’s withdrawal and Dortmund’s collapse, with the team surrendering a 3-1 lead to draw 3-3.There were reports also that Bellingham senior sought a direct meeting with Kovac and “made no secret of his opinion.” Some players are also understood to have noticed his frustration in the restricted area.On Sunday, however, Dortmund managing director Lars Ricken played down the matter, while confirming that new restrictions will now apply. “We got Jobe Bellingham because we really built a relationship of trust with the parents over the years. Now the family flew in especially for their son’s first Bundesliga game and wanted to meet Jobe after the game,” Ricken told Sky90 – The Football Debate“They stood in the hallway to the locker room and had an emotional conversation with Sebastian, which, however, is not a problem at all given this relationship. In the future though, we will ensure that players, coaches, and any officials have access to the locker room area, so that we no longer get into trouble by commenting on such news. But today everything has been resolved – no drama.”Dortmund’s next match comes with the backdrop of a disappointing start, having left Hamburg with only a point despite leading by two goals late on.",Mark and Denise Bellingham banned from Borussia Dortmund's dressing room.

BENGALURU: There is more light at the end of the tunnel with regard to the start of this season's Indian Super League as the All India Football Federation (AIFF) and Football Sports Development Limited (FSDL) concluded a crucial meeting here on Monday.""Both parties approached the discussions in a constructive and positive spirit and expressed confidence in arriving at a mutually agreed proposal that will ensure the continued development and progress of football in India,” AIFF said in a statement. “The joint proposal will be submitted before the Supreme Court on Aug 28,” the AIFF said,adding that the parties will make no further comment as the matter is sub-judice.Meanwhile, sources told TOI that the two parties will meet again in the coming days to finalize the proposal that will be presented in the court. They said that FSDL has agreed to start the season and run it for another year. “As per the master agreement FSDL has to pay Rs 25 crore to AIFF till Dec this year. For the remainder of the season, the AIFF wants Rs 25 crore matching last year's payment but FSDL is bargaining for a lesser payment in the tune of Rs 10-15 crore,"" they said.Sources said the latest and most constructive negotiations would likely see the ISL kick starting in OctoberNovember, almost a two month delay compared to last season, with I-league winners Inter Kashi making their debut as the 14th team.“There were talks of holding the Super Cup before the start of ISL but that looks like a non-starter with six of the 13 teams yet to begin their operations this season. The expected scenario could be a 6-8 weeks pre-season followed by the start of the league in OctNov,” they said.Experts who tracked the developments also said the ISL could even be beamed on a new platform. ""Last year it was on Jio-Hotstar but there are talks to find new takers to telecast the ISL for the coming season. But it is still not clear whether there will be buyers for any short-term offer,"" they added.Sources also said it is only a matter of time before the new agreement is finalised. “The new turn of events came only after the clubs and few players approached the court through the amicus curiae. What is in front of both parties is simple. They have to ensure the minimum number of matches as prescribed by the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) for the clubs to be eligible to play in AFC competitions. The feelers from Monday's meeting is a green signal to all the ISL clubs to hit the active mode button. ”",The All India Football Federation (AIFF) and Football Sports Development Limited (FSDL) concluded a crucial meeting here on Monday.

BENGALURU: New India head coach Khalid Jamil struck a confident note here on Monday when he announced the squad for the CAFA Nations Cup in Tajikistan.While what stood out was the absence of half a dozen key players in the 23-member squad not released by their club Mohun Bagan Super Giant, Jamil said, “We go match by match and after that we'll see. ... This is just preparation (tournament) and we have enough time (for the AFC qualification matches against Singapore).”“The players know that when they go inside, they have to have belief. Everybody is working hard, so that is a good part. They have to be mentally strong, believe in themselves and we must play as a team. That is the first motto for me,” said the first Indian head coach of the national team in more than two decades.“We are coming from offseason and so based on our performance in this tournament, we will plan. Some players were not available; the rest, whoever we wanted, were all in the squad. We have to take it and accept it as a challenge. The Bagan players are not there, so we have to use the other players but I don't feel any difficulty,” the coach added.

Liverpool secured a dramatic 3-2 victory against Newcastle with a 100th-minute winner from 16-year-old Rio Ngumoha, after squandering a two-goal advantage against 10-man Newcastle in Monday's Premier League match.Liverpool's Ryan Gravenberch and Hugo Ekitike scored goals, with Anthony Gordon receiving a red card for a dangerous tackle on Virgil van Dijk between these strikes.Newcastle mounted a comeback at St. James' Park through goals from Bruno Guimaraes and William Osula, but Ngumoha's late strike, making him Liverpool's youngest-ever goalscorer, sealed the win.""This is also what makes the Premier League special. Maybe it wasn't the best game in terms of tactics or in terms of playing football , but I think every fan everywhere around the world enjoyed watching this game of football,"" said Liverpool manager Arne Slot.Liverpool now shares maximum points from two games with Tottenham and Arsenal, with the latter scheduled to visit Anfield on Sunday. Newcastle remain winless as they continue without Alexander Isak, their key striker.Isak previously scored the winning goal when these teams met in the League Cup final in March, helping Newcastle secure their first domestic trophy in 70 years.The Swedish striker has not played for Newcastle this season as he seeks to leave the club.Liverpool appear to be the likely destination for Isak before the transfer window closes in a week.Newcastle rejected Liverpool's £110 million bid, as they seek a British transfer record fee of £150 million. Newcastle's frustration increased as Liverpool also succeeded in signing Ekitike, whom Newcastle had identified as a potential replacement for Isak.Newcastle's striker shortage was evident in their season opener, a goalless draw against 10-man Aston Villa. The issue persisted during the first 30 minutes of this match, despite Newcastle's dominant play supported by over 50,000 fans.Liverpool took an unexpected lead after 35 minutes through Gravenberch's precise long-range shot. Newcastle's situation worsened when Gordon received a red card for a late tackle on Van Dijk before halftime.Liverpool doubled their lead just 20 seconds into the second half through Ekitike's composed finish from Gakpo's assist. Newcastle's protests intensified when Ibrahima Konate avoided a second yellow card for pushing Harvey Barnes.Guimaraes, despite receiving a booking for protesting, scored for Newcastle with a header past Milos Kerkez. Liverpool failed to capitalize on their numerical advantage throughout the second half.Osula, who had limited playing time under Howe, scored his second Premier League goal from Dan Burn's assist to level the match. The game concluded with Liverpool's decisive counter-attack, as Salah's pass and Szoboszlai's dummy set up Ngumoha for the winning goal just before his 17th birthday.","Liverpool beat Newcastle 3-2 in Premier League match at St. James' Park.

The directive came after the ISL’s 2025-26 season was put “on hold” by FSDL on July 11, triggering uncertainty among clubs, players and officials.AIFF president Kalyan Chaubey had earlier said, “Pursuant to the proceedings in the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India this afternoon, the AIFF will enter into good faith negotiations with Football Sports Development Limited (FSDL) in respect of the Master Rights Agreement that is set to expire on December 8, 2025. The parties will endeavour to arrive at mutually agreeable measures to enable timely commencement of the 2025-26 football calendar. ”The deadlock had forced at least three clubs to suspend player and staff payments, while 11 ISL teams, including Bengaluru FC, Kerala Blasters and Mumbai City FC, wrote to the apex court’s amicus curiae highlighting the “existential crisis” they face.The MRA, signed in 2010, grants AIFF an annual sum of ₹50 crore from FSDL. However, the federation has been barred from negotiating new terms until the court delivers its judgment in the pending draft constitution case.With the matter now back before the bench on August 28, the immediate future of Indian football remains tied to the court’s directions.","The All India Football Federation (AIFF) and Football Sports Development Limited (FSDL) on Monday held discussions to determine the path forward for the 2025-26 football season.

From a mental health perspective, I feel a lot lighter, like a weight has come off my shoulders.

What’s common between the three Formula E world champions

How the three World Champions fared in Formula E Season 11

Days after Oliver Rowland lifted his Formula E World Championship trophy in London this season, an interesting trend has come to the attention of Formula E and its fans. As a coincidence, all Formula E drivers who won the Mexico City E-Prix went on to win the Formula E World Championship that season, and this has been proved right for three consecutive years.Highlighting the same since 2023, a poster of three World Champions was shared on X by Formula E with the caption, “The trend continues. Each winner of the #MexicoCityEPrix from the past three seasons has gone on to become World Champion.”The special poster features 2023 Formula E World Champion Jake Dennis from Andretti, then TAG Heuer Porsche’s Pascal Wehrlein, who won in 2024, and the new World Champion, Nissan driver Oliver Rowland. All three of them won in the Mexico E-Prix and went on to lift the winner’s trophy in the Formula E World Championship that year.Oliver Rowland had strengthened his chances of winning the Formula E World Championship this year much earlier. He was leading the Formula E Driver Standings ever since he won Part 2 of the Jeddah E-Prix, which was his second win of the season after winning the Mexico E-Prix. In the last leg, the Nissan driver got nervous for a while as Pascal Wehrlein, who was following him in the number two position, closed the gap after grabbing quite a few podiums while Rowland had a dull period.Things became serious for Rowland when he failed to finish the Round 13 race in Berlin, while Wehrlein won second spot on the podium. But he eventually managed to confirm his championship in Berlin after four wins and three more podiums.Sharing about his bad race in Berlin, Rowland had said, “I was hoping before the weekend that the outcome could be [the World Championship], but after yesterday (Saturday) and this morning (Sunday), I was more worried that it might never come.”Also Read: Oliver Rowland reacts to daughter’s sweet radio message after Formula E Championship win: “It’s amazing” Things, however, changed for Wehrlein, who was pushed to third position after Nick Cassidy made a late entry in the Formula E Driver Standings by registering three consecutive wins. He was pushed from second place to third, with Cassidy in second. Wehrlein registered one win and five more podiums this season.Meanwhile, Andretti driver Jake Dennis finished in seventh position in the Formula E Driver Standings. He won two podium spots this season.","All three Formula E drivers who won the Mexico City E-Prix went on to win the Formula E World Championship that season.

Taylor Barnard on losing top three spot in Formula E World Championship

Fans hail Taylor Barnard for his fantastic rookie season

It was Taylor Barnard’s rookie season this year, and the NEOM McLaren driver put up a fantastic performance by temporarily making it to the top three in the Formula E Driver Standings by ousting the much more experienced Porsche driver Antonio Felix Da Costa. He was, however, ousted from the top three at the London E-Prix as Jaguar’s Nick Cassidy went on to register three consecutive wins. Barnard took to Instagram to share his feelings on losing out on the top three in his first-ever season and his claim to the championship.Taking to Instagram after the London E-Prix, Barnard wrote, “London wasn’t what we hoped for, easily being the toughest weekend of our season. Taking 0 points away as a team from a doubleheader hurts, but one weekend doesn’t define the year we’ve had.”He further wrote, “As the season closes, I want to say a massive thank you to the entire team, both trackside and behind the scenes, for everything this season. Finishing P4 in the Drivers’ Championship and coming into the final weekend with a shot at runner-up is something to be proud of.”Also adding a note for teammate Sam Bird, as NEOM McLaren withdrew from Formula E after the end of the season, Barnard wrote, “@sambird_official it wasn’t the weekend you deserved either.You’ve been a huge part of my season both on and off the track, and I’m grateful for everything. You deserved more. To all the Papaya fans, thank you for the incredible support in our final race together. You always go above and beyond. ”Reacting to his post, a fan wrote, “An incredible debut season, huge congrats and excited to see where you go next!” Another said, “I know I said it the other day, but you’ve been incredible to watch this last year and a pleasure to support you in Papaya — there are many of us that can’t wait to support you in whatever you do next!” One more commented, “You were incredible all season around, Taylor. Massive congratulations. You are the future of this sport.”Recalling Barnard’s maiden pole, a fan also wrote, “Fantastic season, Taylor, we'll never forget that Monaco pole.”Also Read: Taylor Barnard looks back at rookie season at McLaren: “Every step has been unforgettable” Barnard claimed five podiums in his first full season in Formula E.

McLaren team principal Ian James pens open letter to fans

What’s next in Formula E?

Team Principal Ian James of the departing Formula E team NEOM McLaren has penned an open letter to the fans of the team, marking their departure from the electric motorsport format. Addressing the Papaya Army, James thanked them for their trust and support as the team went on to win two Drivers’ World Championships and two Teams’ World Championships over 103 races in seven seasons.Ian James began the letter saying that he wrote it with “a huge amount of pride, as well as with more than a hint of sadness,” as the team closed the final chapter after seven years of competing in the ABB FIA Formula E World Championship.Thanking the fans for their love on social media and at the track, he said, “The team was always blown away by the amount of papaya we saw at circuits across the world, race-in, race-out, right from our very first round as the NEOM McLaren Formula E team. Through the early days, the good days, the bad days, and the great days, we have always felt an overwhelming amount of support from you all.”For the partners associated with the team, he wrote, “They say that ‘racing is a state of mind’, and since its inception, this team has had the privilege of working for organisations, with partners, and racing for fans who fully embrace this philosophy.This is certainly true of those at McLaren, whose passion for racing is second to none.”“My heartfelt thanks go out to everyone who has been involved: those at McLaren who backed us, the fans who supported us, and the partners who allowed us to go racing. We couldn’t have done it without you all — your trust and support have never been taken for granted,” he added.Praising the two McLaren drivers, he wrote, “Sam clinched McLaren’s first-ever fully electric win at the São Paulo E-Prix in Season 10, pulling off one of Formula E’s all-time great overtakes, before being waved across the line by none other than Emerson Fittipaldi – McLaren's first Formula 1 World Champion. While Taylor has been a rookie sensation in Season 11, securing five Formula E records, including the youngest driver to start a race, the youngest points scorer, the youngest driver to lead a lap, the youngest podium finisher, and the youngest polesitter. ”He ended the letter saying, “Some of us have been together since the day we first launched this team, while others have seamlessly fitted in along the way and flourished within the environment we have cultivated. For many, I am sure that we will cross paths again soon, but whatever the future holds for those here at Bicester, whatever path they choose to follow, I have no doubt that it will be bright. Their potential is limitless. ”Reacting to the open letter on Instagram, Taylor Barnard wrote, “It’s been an honour to wear Papaya and represent this team.” Sam Bird also dropped a heart emoji and a hands-joined-in-prayer emoji in the comments section.Also Read: Taylor Barnard looks back at rookie season at McLaren: “Every step has been unforgettable” Neither Taylor Barnard nor Sam Bird has revealed their future course of action in Formula E Season 12.

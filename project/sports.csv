Champions Trophy: Shubman Gill identifies where India-Pakistan could be won or lost

DUBAI: Eight months after India pipped Pakistan in a thrilling, low-scoring group match of the T20 World Cup on a difficult pitch in New York, cricket's most storied but, of late more of over-hyped rivalry will present its latest installment when a red-hot India, eyeing a semifinal berth, play Pakistan, struggling for survival in their first ICC tournament as hosts in 29 years, on Sunday night at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium in game five of the 2025 Champions Trophy.Boosted by premier pacer Mohammed Shami 's five-wicket haul and a brilliant century (101 not out) by classy opener Shubman Gill-enjoying a purple patch in ODIs- India vanquished Bangladesh by six wickets in their lung-opener on Thursday.With Shami roaring back into form, the young Harshit Rana having impressed so far, and India's three-pronged spin attack, which conceded just 123 runs in 29 overs looking effective on this slow pitch which didn't seem to be too conducive for stroke-making, India's attack looks fairly decent and good enough for the job even without the talismanic Jasprit Bumrah . Left-arm spinner Axar Patil was unlucky to have missed out on the first hat-trick in the Champions Trophy since 2006, and while Ravindra Jadeja and Kuldeep Yadav went wicketless, they were economical.However, India's biggest USP at the moment seems to be Gill, currently the No 1 rated batsman in the ODIs. The Indian vice-captain has shrugged off his struggles in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy on the fast and bouncy pitches in Australia and looked in prime form.While Gill is yet to prove his mettle in Test cricket-his average after 32 Tests is a mere 35.05, in the ODIs, his numbers, as Indian captain Rohit Sharma said before the Bangladesh game, are ""crazy""-2688 runs in 51 matches@62.51, with eight hundreds and 15 fifties. Gill's scores in his last four ODIs are -87, 60, 112 & 101*. At the moment, Gill, whether he is dancing down the track to hit he bowlers inside out or flick and pulling them through the square leg, is finding the sweet spot of the bat and only seeing the gaps on the field. The two sixes that he smashed to mid-wicket off Tanzim Hasan Sakib on Thursday night will remain etched in the memory for long.India will also be encouraged by the way 'keeper-bat KL Rahul chipped in with a useful 41 not out to help Gill finish off the chase against Bangladesh.On Saturday, India's superstar bat Virat Kohli , in a bid to sort out his issues against spin, arrived three hours before the scheduled practice time at the ICC Cricket Academy, along with assistant coach Abhishek Nayar. He practiced against the top 20 bowlers of UAE-left-arm spinners and leg-spinners.With Indian captain Rohit Sharma showing glimpses of his vintage form in his 36-ball 41, India's sole worry will be the scratchy form of Kohli, who, after scoring 22 in the last match, succumbed to a leg-spinner for the third time in a row when he cut a Rishad Hossain delivery to backward point-twice in the ODI series against England at home, he succumbed to Rashid Khan.Perhaps, playing against Pakistan, against whom he enjoys a tremendous record-678 runs in 16 ODIs @52.15, with three hundreds and a highest score of 183 at Dhaka in 2012, will bring the best out of the former India captain. Pakistan leggie Abrar Ahmed, and even left-armer Khushdil Shah and off-spinner Salman Agha will fancy their chances against the ageing superstar.Meanwhile, Pakistan, who trained under lights at the ICC Academy here after arriving on Friday for this big-ticket clash, are already staring at the embarrassment of an early exit from the tournament after going down to an efficient New Zealand by 60 runs losing their opening match, outplayed as they were in all the departments at the National Stadium in Karachi. Perennial slow starters, their woes have been worsened after explosive opener Fakhar Zaman was ruled out of the event on Wednesday.Fakhar's enforced ouster has deprived the team of its second first-choice opener following the untimely injury to Saim Ayub in Australia. Eight years ago, at The Oval on June 17, it was Fakhar who played a stellar role in Pakistan's sensational 180-run victory over India in the final of the 2017 Champions Trophy in England.The man to have replaced Fakhar is another left-handed opener in Imam-ul-Haq, but unlike Fakhar, he isn't someone who can destroy a bowling attack. Another worry for Pakistan the strike rate these days of former captain Babar Azam, who took 90 balls to score 64 against the Kiwis the other day.Apart from current form, history too is stacked heavily against Pakistan, and in favour of India here. At ICC events, spanning both the white-ball formats, India own a 17-4 record against their arch-rivals, which means that they enter Sunday's contest as the overwhelming favourites. In the past two weeks, Pakistan have lost three ODIs to New Zealand at home. However, Mohammad Rizwan & Co can draw confidence from the fact that three out of Pakistan's four victories over India at ICC tournaments have come at the Champions Trophy, including the final in 2017. At the moment, though, the defending champions face the prospect of being eliminated from the tournament.With their backs to the wall, facing an in-form India in a must-win league game, Pakistan are drawing inspiration from two favourable results they have had against India at the DICS in recent times. They had beaten India here in October 2021 and September 2022, albeit in T20Is.""We have beaten India twice here in Dubai. We will aim to make it three and repeat those performances. We are confident, and it will be a great match,"" Pakistan pacer Harris Rauf said on Friday evening.Underlining the magnitude of the big game against India and the need to forget about the Kiwi defeat, Rauf said ""What's past is past. We are now focusing on the India game. We will address the mistakes we made in the previous game and try not to repeat them. For us, it's an important fixture; a do-or-die game. We need to win this to stand a chance of qualifying for the semifinals.""Rauf, who conceded 83-2 in 10 overs against New Zealand claimed that the morale of his side ahead of the must-win game was still upbeat. ""The morale is not down; all the boys will try hard and give their best. It is an important fixture, and we will aim to perform well in all departments - batting, bowling, and fielding. There is no extra pressure; we are relaxed. We will treat it as just another match,"" he said.While the form book favours India, Pakistan can be unpredictable and mercurial. It's pertinent to remember that Pakistan are at their most dangerous when they have their backs to the wall.The 'hosts' will once again bank on their pacers Shaheen Shah Afridi, Naseem Shah, Rauf and Mohammad Hasnain- who can be terrific or erratic on a given day.",India take on Pakistan in Champions Trophy game five in Dubai. India beat Bangladesh by six wickets in their opening match on Thursday. Pakistan are struggling for survival in their first ICC tournament as hosts in 29 years. Fakhar Zaman was ruled out of the event following an early exit from the tournament.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118494022,imgsize-57940,width-400,resizemode-4/118494022.jpg"

Champions Trophy EXCLUSIVE: India, Pakistan prepare for blockbuster in Dubai

""We are different countries. We have different jerseys. But the game only knows the basics. You reap the rewards of hard work. It's the environment within the stadium that elevates your performance, and that's exactly the case when we play against Pakistan, more than any other team,"" says India great Virat Kohli - in a video released by the official broadcasters - while talking about the game against Pakistan on February 23 in Dubai.Political correctness isn't Kohli's forte. He doesn't hide behind 'it's-just-another-game' platitudes. He loves the hype and the big-game pressure whenever India play Pakistan. His numbers against Pakistan prove it: 16 ODIs, 678 runs, avg 52.15, strike-rate 100.29.Intensity? 10,000 units. Examples? Mirpur (2012), Adelaide (2015), Colombo (2023), Birmingham (2017). Clutch checklist? 23-10-22, T20 World Cup, Melbourne. Making the impossible possible? Over 18.5. THAT shot against Haris Rauf. T20 WC performance vs Pak? 6 matches, 312 runs, avg 156, strike-rate 132.Don't watch the stroke for its remarkable execution. Don't track the trajectory of the ball after its appointment with the middle of Kohli's willow. Zoom into the batter's eyes. Hear his heart pound.But before every act of heroism, there is misplaced early bravado. Pakistan were Kohli's first opponents in ICC events at Centurion in the 2009 Champions Trophy. And his inside-out shot against Shahid Afridi , which landed in the juggling palms of Umar Gul at long off, still haunts him since it derailed India's chase. He vowed to become a 'chasemaster' after that, ticking that bucket list innumerable times.However, two of India's three defeats to Pakistan in the Champions Trophy have come in Kohli's era. The last one was in 2017, a humiliating 180-run mauling in the final at the Oval when Kohli was captain. India were favourites but imploded against a freakish Fakhar Zaman, who scored a century, and an inspired opening burst with the ball from Mohammed Amir.Conspiracy theorists also attributed the loss to a revolt against the coach. It was also under Kohli's leadership that Pakistan broke their winless streak in World Cups against India, winning by 10 wickets in Dubai in the 2021 T20 World Cup.Kohli would want to set some records straight here. He also has some self-doubt to slay after his troubles in red-ball cricket and all the trolling he has endured.Clouds of apprehension have also circled around skipper Rohit Sharma's head. With his famed hand-eye coordination showing signs of slackening, the ability to judge length early has also vaporized. It has resulted in his form in Tests showing an alarming dip, triggering tame dismissals at home and in Australia.The red flag is up for him, especially in the longest format. But his form in white-ball cricket has been excellent. Ever since he adopted and communicated the need to embrace a high-risk, high-reward strategy in the Powerplay, Rohit has helped in giving the team a massive launchpad to go big while batting first. In pursuit of targets, he has managed to break the back of big chases and make the equation easier for the rest of the batters.Rohit has a fabulous record against Pakistan. In 19 matches, he has scored 873 runs, averaging 51.35 with two tons and eight half-centuries.The last time the two teams met in 50-overs cricket, in Dubai, he was leading in the 2018 Asia Cup and stroked an unbeaten 111. His 140 in Manchester on a gloomy Sunday in the 2019 World Cup was a masterclass in taking the game on. The slashed six off Hasan Ali over deep point evoked comparisons with the great Sachin Tendulkar 's storied upper cut off Shoaib Akhtar in Centurion in 2003.Rohit also belted a 63-ball 86 that demoralized the men-in-green in 2023 in Ahmedabad, putting on a tutorial in how to pull high-pace deliveries into the galleries.But he has fallen victim to left arm pace and the ball swinging in from over the wicket. Shaheen Shah Afridi got him LBW with a deadly yorker in the 2021 T20 World Cup. Mohammed Amir did the same in the 2016 Asia Cup in Mirpur and the 2017 Champions Trophy final at the Oval.The Cuttack hundred against England has enabled Rohit to keep the doubters away for a while. Another attacking and authoritative knock against Mohammed Rizwan and Co. could help him increase that distance.'RoKo' as a hashtag is popular but superficial and an attempt to hyphenate the careers and achievements of the two Indian batting superstars. A combined effort from the two veterans, though, may not just help India win another global trophy, but it may also enable toxic fans of Rohit and Kohli to co-exist respectfully and make the social media space more palatable.","India face Pakistan in the Champions Trophy final in Dubai on February 23. Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma have stellar records against Pakistan. Kohli has scored 678 runs in 16 ODIs and has a strike-rate of 100.29. Rohit has scored 873 runs, averaging 51.35 with two tons and eight half-centuries.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118494603,imgsize-58838,width-400,resizemode-4/118494603.jpg"

Champions Trophy EXCLUSIVE: India, Pakistan prepare for blockbuster in Dubai

Sunday's game will be a grudge match for India. The wounds of the 2017 Champions Trophy final against Pakistan are still fresh. For India, a team that has dominated its arch-rivals in ICC tournaments across formats, the Champions Trophy has often been a banana peel. It's the only ICC tournament where Pakistan have got the better of India.Two of the three defeats came in England - in 2004 and 2017 - while the other defeat came in South Africa in 2009. The conditions offered substantial help to seamers and Pakistan showed why they were better than India on that front.Circumstances are a lot different going into Sunday's match. India have largely dominated Pakistan at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium. Their only two defeats against Pakistan here have come in the T20 format. Revisiting the ODI face-offs at the venue, India didn't break a sweat in the two matches against Pakistan in the 2018 Asia Cup Going by early indications of the Dubai pitch, where India played Bangladesh and won, there won't be any exaggerated seam movement. India are loaded with competent spinners, while Pakistan have one 'mystery' spinner in Abrar Ahmed.As for Pakistan's pacers, their reputation of being a nursery for fast bowlers seems to have hit a roadblock after the exit of Mohammed Amir, the man responsible for triggering India's top-order collapses at Centurion and the Oval in 2009 and 2017.Shaheen Shah Afridi isn't the force he was while Naseem Shah is a work in progress. One of Afridi's best spells, however, came against India in the 2021 T20 World Cup in Dubai.Pakistan's batting too doesn't inspire much confidence at the moment. They seem to be playing an outdated brand of cricket. They don't have the depth or reputation to consistently dominate a world-class attack. However, India will still be wary of Pakistan's unpredictable nature.A lot has changed since 2017. For India, captain Rohit Sharma Virat Kohli and Ravindra Jadeja are in the last leg of their ODI careers. Hardik Pandya has grown in stature, but an unsettled middle order is still cause for concern in case of an early collapse.Going by form and conditions, Pakistan are the clear underdogs going into the match. India just need to mind their step.","India have dominated Pakistan at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium. Their only two defeats against Pakistan here have come in the T20 format.

Pakistan team trains ahead of Champions Trophy clash vs India | EXCLUSIVE VISUALS

NEW DELHI: India's newly crowned world No.1 ODI batter, Shubman Gill , lived up to his billing with a magnificent century, steering India to a six-wicket victory over Bangladesh in their ICC Champions Trophy 2025 opener. His composed knock, his second consecutive ODI ton, reinforced his dominance in white-ball cricket and drew high praise from former Australian captain Ricky Ponting Speaking on The ICC Review, Ponting hailed the 25-year-old's rise to the top of the rankings, calling it a reflection of his class and consistency.""He thoroughly deserves to be the number one ranked batter in the world at the moment,"" Ponting said. ""It's a great sign for India that he's got his account underway early in the first game of a Champions Trophy.""While Gill has yet to make a significant mark in Test cricket, Ponting stressed that ODIs and T20s are perfectly suited to his style.""He's been a very, very good international player for a number of years,"" Ponting noted. ""He hasn't sort of transferred that over into Test Match cricket yet, but his white-ball cricket over the last three or four years has been outstanding. Look, he's a big-game player as well. He's played really well in IPLs over the last couple of years, obviously being captain of his franchise there.""Ponting particularly praised Gill's ability to score freely in ODIs, especially against fast bowling.""He can come out and be nice and aggressive early in the power play with the field up, get some boundaries away early by playing good, naturally aggressive cricketing shots,"" Ponting explained. ""He's not a big hitter, he doesn't try to do anything outside of his natural game, but he scores boundaries almost at will against fast bowling.""Beyond his batting prowess, Ponting also sees leadership potential in Gill.""He just seems like a really nice character, very driven for what he wants to achieve in the game,"" Ponting said. ""We've had a chance to catch up over the last couple of years, particularly around the IPL season. I just like his demeanor. He seems like a very driven guy that wants to be the best he possibly can with batting and also in leadership.""Gill's eighth ODI century, helping India chase down 229 against Bangladesh on a tricky pitch in Dubai, further solidified his reputation as India's premier white-ball batter.","Ricky Ponting hails India's world No.1 ODI batter, Shubman Gill. Ponting says Gill's rise to the top of the rankings is a reflection of his class and consistency.

Once upon a time, cobbling up your own combined India-Pakistan XIs over long afternoons used to be standard practice for cricket fans. That was the era of fierce cross-border rivalries, when the two teams regularly played each other in bilateral contests in addition to the desert derbies in Sharjah.Things have changed now. India and Pakistan are not allowed to play against one another often enough, but memories of those great ODIs through the 1980s and 90s - and into the first decade of the 2000s - still linger.Here is TOI's take on a fantasy ODI XI, from four decades of ODIs, comprising players from both teams. This XI is not just about players with the best numbers, but those who had the maximum impact in India-Pak ODIs. Apologies are in order to some greats who missed out.The obvious selection. His average of 40.09 in 69 head-to-head games is lower than many, but some of Tendulkar's most unforgettable ODI innings came against Pakistan. Tendulkar can walk into this XI only on the basis of the 98 he struck against a top-class Pakistan attack in the 2003 World Cup game in Centurion.Our pick will raise eyebrows, because it comes at the expense of another classy Indian opener, Rohit Sharma . But Anwar's average of 43.52 over 50 matches shows the kind of impact he had in ODIs against India. Anwar's flair and ability to take apart attacks made him one of the best openers of his generation. The 194 in Chennai in the 1997 Independence Cup against India is still the highest individual score in this epic rivalry.The modern master has played only 16 games against Pakistan, but it is impossible not to make him the No. 3. Kohli is arguably the greatest ODI batter of his generation, with the highest number of centuries in the format. His 183 in Dhaka in the Asia Cup match against Pakistan, on March 18, 2012, was ironically the last time Tendulkar featured in an ODI against Pakistan.The big man dominated India-Pak contests for more than a decade. An average of 43.69 and four centuries over 67 games underlines the effect he had on this rivalry. Ask any Indian captain of that generation and they would say that 'Inzy' was the best finisher of the game, not Michael Bevan. And who can forget the burly Inzamam's iconic attack, with bat raised, on an Indian fan in Toronto in 1997 for being taunted with 'Aloo' chants? This gentle giant sure had entertainment value!The 'street fighter' changed the course of this rivalry with his last-ball six off Chetan Sharma in the Australasia Cup final in Sharjah in 1986. Before that, for a few years, India had dominated the rivalry, but that one innings led to a complete change of momentum for almost a decade and a half. An average of 51.08 in 35 head-to-heads speaks volumes about the kind of impact Miandad had. For a generation of Indian cricket fans, his presence at the crease induced fear and awe.The greatest leader that sub-continental cricket has seen in the last 50 years. His 6-14 in Sharjah is still remembered as one of the finest spells in ODI cricket. It was under Imran that Pakistan became an unbeatable force towards the end of the 1980s, culminating in Imran leading Pakistan to their only ODI World Cup win in 1992.There simply hasn't been a better wicketkeeper-batter in India-Pak ODIs. Dhoni first made his mark in ODIs with a blistering 148 off 123 balls against Pakistan in Vizag, a performance that kept his career alive after a string of failures. He followed that up with a superb away series in Pakistan in 2006, which made president Pervez Musharraf his fan.The star allrounder was the heart and soul of the Indian attack when India were dominating this contest in the 1980s. It is impossible to forget his superb spell in the Benson and Hedges Final at MCG in 1985 that set up one of India's greatest moments in ODI cricket. Also, when India started losing ground later in the decade, Kapil never lost his verve and kept taking the attack to Pakistan, both with bat and the ball.The finest white-ball pacer of all time. Akram is the highest wicket-taker in this contest. In 48 games, the left-arm artist took 60 wickets at average of 25.15. Add to that some late-order cameos with the bat that used to change the course of the desert derbies in the late 1980s and 1990s. Till Akram was in business, India were never the favourites going into this contest. Things changed in India's favour only when after Akram retired in 2003.This is a rivalry that hasn't exactly been dominated by spinners, primarily because batters from these two countries, till a few years ago, used to be magnificent players of spin. Still, against the best in the business, Kumble held his own with 54 wickets from 34 games, including a 4-12 in the Sahara Cup in Toronto in 1996. That the likes of Miandad, Mohammed Younus and Inzamam never really took Kumble apart shows his greatness.The king of the doosra. With 57 wickets from 37 games, Saqlain was an enigma that the great Tendulkar, Rahul Dravid and Sourav Ganguly all struggled against. The beauty of Saqlain was that he could be as effective in the death overs as well, bamboozling batters looking for the big shots with his beautifully disguised other one, or doosra, which became one of the most difficult balls to face in that eraA batsman that Indian bowlers feared like no other in the late 1980s. His unbeaten 72 off 36 balls in the first ODI ever played at Eden Gardens, in 1987, still gives Indian fans from the era nightmares.A pacer with an uncanny ability to make a mark in India-Pak matches. Took a hat-trick in the tri-series final in Sharjah in 1991, where he finished with 7-37 -still the best figures in India-Pak ODIs. He probably would have made it, just that Kapil, Imran and Akram cannot be dropped.Walks into any ODI team, just that Anwar had a bigger impact for a longer period of time in this rivalry.The best pace bowler of the current generation doesn't have a big enough sample size when it comes to performances in India-Pak games.Older Pakistan fans won't recall his name with a lot of fondness.

Mohammad Amir Exclusive: Champions Trophy hopes, India's absence & retirement talk

NEW DELHI: In-form Shubman Gill etched his name into the record books with a composed, unbeaten 101 as India began their ICC Champions Trophy campaign with a six-wicket victory over Bangladesh on Thursday. Gill’s knock anchored India’s chase of a tricky 229-run target on a challenging surface, with the team reaching the finish line with 21 balls to spare.The 25-year-old vice-captain continued his sublime form, securing his eighth ODI hundred in just 51 innings — making him the fastest Indian to reach the milestone. He surpassed the previous record held by Shikhar Dhawan , who took 57 innings, while Virat Kohli (68 innings), Gautam Gambhir (98 innings), and Sachin Tendulkar (111 innings) followed in the list.""Definitely one of my most satisfying innings that I have played and my first century in ICC events,"" Gill said after receiving the Man of the Match award. ""Very happy with the way I performed.""India's captain Rohit Sharma lauded Gill's efforts, emphasising the young opener's consistency and class. ""Gill, we know the class that he has, shouldn't surprise anyone. It was good to see him bat till the end,"" Rohit remarked.Gill's remarkable ODI career has continued to flourish since his debut in 2019. In 51 matches, he has amassed 2,688 runs at an astounding average of 62.51, striking at 100.78. Alongside his eight centuries, he has registered 15 half-centuries, further cementing his reputation as one of India's most promising batters.Interestingly, Gill's century against Bangladesh was his slowest in ODIs, taking 125 balls to reach the three-figure mark. However, his measured innings proved vital in navigating India to victory on a testing pitch.Also See: India vs Pakistan Head to Head Records Having recently won the Player of the Series award in India's 3-0 sweep against England, where he scored 259 runs, Gill's red-hot form bodes well for India as they continue their pursuit of Champions Trophy glory.","Shubman Gill scores unbeaten 101 as India beat Bangladesh by six wickets.

NEW DELHI: Former India captain Sourav Ganguly believes KL Rahul 's ""fantastic numbers"" in ODIs may have given him the edge over Rishabh Pant as India's first-choice wicketkeeper-batter in the ongoing Champions Trophy.Head coach Gautam Gambhir backed Rahul to take on the wicketkeeping duties for the marquee ICC event, leaving Pant on the sidelines.""India are such a strong side, especially in batting. Pant is very good. But Rahul has fantastic numbers in ODIs. So, I think that's the reason Gautam Gambhir has backed Rahul,"" Ganguly said after he was announced as the brand ambassador of Vura, a construction chemical brand.""There's very little to choose between them (Rahul and Pant) because both are exceptional,"" he added.The former BCCI chief also backed Virat Kohli to overcome his leg-spin woes, while tipping India as favourites to bag the Champions Trophy title.""India have five Shubman Gills from one, two, three, four, five, six -- who can all score hundreds and win matches.

There's batting after batting.""India have a house of talent because of the systems we have and the way we play our cricket.""Kohli once again fell to a leg-spinner but Ganguly was confident that the star batter will overcome this challenge.""The quality of cricketer Virat Kohli is ---I'm sure he will be able to sort this out. He has got 81 international hundreds, and I'm sure he scored runs against leg-spin also. So, it was probably just one of those days when he got out. He has to find a way to play it.""While India and New Zealand are Ganguly's picks from Group A, he said Australia could miss out on the semifinals due to the absence of key players.""New Zealand have beaten Pakistan. So, New Zealand is ahead. If India beat Pakistan, then Pakistan will probably be out of the competition. So, I see India and New Zealand progressing from this group.""""From the other group, I'm a little worried about Australia because there's no (Pat) Cummins, no Mitchell Starc, and no Josh Hazlewood.

HOW GROUP 'A' STANDS

PAKISTAN'S CHANCES AT PRESENT

Such is the format of the Champions Trophy that it allows no room for error and even a single defeat at the group stage can put a team out of the tournament.With eight sides in the fray for the top honours, the two groups include four teams each.Talking about Group A involving the two archrivals India and Pakistan, the latter will be feeling the heat going into the match against the traditional rivals on February 23 in Dubai , following their defeat in the tournament opener against New Zealand in Karachi.The Kiwis outclassed the defending champions by 60 runs in the first match of the Champions Trophy, while India beat Bangladesh by six wickets.New Zealand are on top at the moment with two points, with India at No.2 with the same number of points because the Kiwis have a better net run-rate (NRR) of +1.200 compared to India's +0.408.Bangladesh are ahead of bottom-placed Pakistan with a better NRR. Both the teams are without any points, while Bangladesh's NRR of -0.408 better than Pakistan's -1.200.Pakistan have two matches left to play -- vs India on February 23 and vs Bangladesh on February 27.If Pakistan lose to India, then the tournament will be virtually over for the hosts as New Zealand are expected to beat Bangladesh a day later on February 24.However, if Pakistan beat India, the group will be thrown wide open because India will then have the tough match left against New Zealand while the tournament hosts will fancy their chances against Bangladesh in their concluding fixture.But it will be foolhardy to rule Bangladesh out, especially because of their recent success against Pakistan, who would want their neighbours to beat New Zealand on February 24, which will keep their slim semifinal chances alive even in the face of a defeat against India on Sunday.Top two teams from each of the two groups qualify for the semifinals.","Pakistan face archrivals India in Champions Trophy on February 23.

Mohammed Shami: 'I just go for wickets; don't care about the economy rate at all'

NEW DELHI: India began their Champions Trophy campaign on a high with a six-wicket victory over Bangladesh, and vice-captain Shubman Gill heaped praise on Mohammed Shami for his impressive 5/53 spell. Gill hailed the veteran pacer as a ""legend,"" emphasising the difficulty of making a strong comeback after an injury.Returning after a 14-month layoff following Achilles tendon surgery, Shami delivered a stellar performance, becoming the fastest Indian bowler to reach 200 ODI wickets. He also surpassed all others to become India's leading wicket-taker in ICC 50-over tournaments.“Whenever he comes to bowl in an ICC tournament, he doesn't take less than five wickets. It’s always 4, 5, 4 and 5. Sometimes it happens that you don't know when he’s taken five wickets.”“Mehidy performs well against us. When we were playing in the Bangladesh series, he performed well against us. But the way Shami Bhai bowled those lines and lengths, he didn't let the pressure go off the new batter.”“It meant that he had to make runs and Shami bhai kept putting balls on that line and swung from there. The catch was good, as it came to me fast. The way he has come back, I think after the injury it is not easy to make a comeback, and he is a legend,” said Gill in a video posted on bcci.tv.Talking about his spell, Shami said, “The only difference is that I have come back from the injury. I can't see anything else. The rhythm at that time was good. I am still doing very well. I have come here after 14 months of practice, and I have got the result. I am very happy, and I am enjoying the process.”In the chase of 229, Gill hit an unbeaten 101 off 129 balls, laced with nine fours and two sixes, as India reached home with 21 balls to spare. “It’s my first century in ICC tournaments. In the World Cup, I missed out two-three times. Once I was batting well and got out on 90. So this is very satisfying for me, especially coming in a chase. I was backing myself to finish the game for the team, and that's what I tried to do,” he said.Shami was also in praise of Gill. “The way he has handled the innings from the start to the end on the crease, it is very important to hold on to one end and make runs there as well and to make a 100 on a wicket like that is not an easy feat.”With India set to take on Pakistan in Sunday’s clash at Dubai, Shami signed off by saying, “I just want to say one thing - the form in this ICC tournament, and of most of the players, may it continue in the same way, and all of us keep performing for our team.”","Mohammed Shami becomes fastest Indian bowler to reach 200 ODI wickets.

Mohammed Shami: 'I just go for wickets; don't care about the economy rate at all'

A sizable crowd had gathered outside the ICC Academy in Dubai on Friday when the Pakistan cricket team arrived for their first training session since landing in the city a day prior. Amid the chants of ""Babar, Babar, King Babar, humara King Babar"", the players rushed into the facility without even acknowledging the presence of the fans who were screaming their lungs out for autographs and selfies. The dash of players left many disappointed, and some were even in tears, but the team seemed focussed on the job at hand.They had very little time to get used to the conditions in Dubai which are very different from what they are getting back home in Pakistan for the ongoing Champions Trophy . Since Saturday would be more about getting used to the ring of fire at the Dubai International Stadium , Friday's session was critical for the host nation to tick the crucial boxes before the big game. Just when the players finished their warm-up drills and headed to the change room to put on their respective gear, they were greeted by a familiar face.Former Pakistan cricketer Mudassar Nazar got everyone in a circle of sorts and had a long chat before the players got down to business in the middle. Nazar is not just a former cricketer but someone who is familiar with the local conditions in Dubai. Having worked with the ICC Academy in Dubai and even as the interim coach of the UAE cricket team, including the U-19 batches for some tournaments, the former opener was the ideal man to be around the Pakistan players for what was going to be their only full-throttle session ahead of the India clash.The 68-year-old, who has been Pakistan's coach and served the country's cricket board in various capacities, had plenty of one-on-one interactions with the players during their session under lights. While most of the batters were part of the group which patiently listened to the veteran, the bowlers received some pep talk after they were done with their batting sessions. Nazar has camped in Dubai for a very long time and his tenure even overlapped with current Pakistan coach Aaqib Javed who was in charge of UAE's team from 2012 to 2016.Both Nazar and Javed are tactically very shrewd and aware of the conditions in this part of the world. It now remains to be seen whether the team can benefit from their inputs and stay alive in the multi-nation tournament. They have had success against India in Dubai and pacer Haris Rauf is confident that the side will improve the tally to three wins.""We have beaten India twice here in Dubai. We will aim to make it three and repeat those performances. We are confident, and it will be a great match,"" said Harris Rauf ahead of the team's training session.Pakistan lost their tournament opener versus New Zealand on February 19 but Rauf assured that the team will ""address the mistakes"" before the must-win clash vs India.""What's past is past. We are now focusing on the India game. We will address the mistakes we made in the previous game and try not to repeat them. For us, it's an important fixture; a do-or-die game. We need to win this to stand a chance of qualifying for the semifinals,"" said Rauf.After spending over three hours at the global cricket body's training facility, the players left their kit bags with the logistics team and had a quick bite before boarding the team bus. There were plenty still waiting for a glimpse of their heroes when they exited the venue in small batches and this time Babar Azam didn't disappoint them and patiently signed autographs, posed for selfies.

Champions Trophy EXCLUSIVE: India, Pakistan prepare for blockbuster in Dubai

Champions Trophy: Shubman Gill identifies where India-Pakistan could be won or lost

Champions Trophy: Lalchand Rajput on what to expect in India vs Pakistan | On Rohit, Kohli's form

There was pin drop silence at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium when the ground staff were busy with their last moment preparations on the playing square. The stands were as deserted as the roads leading to the venue and the buzz continued to be amiss during the Dubai leg of the Champions Trophy . Stakes, however, are high in the multi-nation tournament with India and Pakistan set to take the field on what promises to be an action-packed Sunday.The only shade of blue would be in the middle as the capacity crowd would ensure the similar-coloured seats remain occupied. It's a sell-out and re-selling activity is rife in the local Dubai groups with buyers ready to shell out as much as four times the face value. It's India vs Pakistan after all and even if the competition is not what it used to be, pressure remains high as ever. The Men in Blue have had the upper hand in this format, as their last defeat to Pakistan came in the 2017 Champions Trophy final. Since then, they have won five games out of six with the exception being the washed out group game in the Asia Cup.Skill wise, the rivalry is heavily tilted towards India but pressure can do funny things, and continues to make this fixture the most sought-after property in cricket. And it was repeated multiple times when India vice-captain Shubman Gill and Pakistan head coach Aaqib Javed spoke with the media.Gill, who is yet to make a substantial contribution with the bat against Pakistan, feels the team which handles pressure better will take the win but asserted that they're treating this as just another fixture. It isn't the first time we have heard a statement like this from the Indian corner but Gill's relaxed body language did downplay the hype. When asked if this was the ""biggest match"", the youngster chose to disagree.""Firstly, I think it is a big match, but I think the biggest match would obviously be the final that the team plays. And definitely we have been playing some good ODI cricket and Pakistan unfortunately I think have lost some of the matches that they have played recently but by no means I think we are going to take them as a lesser side. I think they have got a good side and it is important for us to bring our A game tomorrow,"" said Gill.In the opposite corner, coach Aaqib Javed, who has featured in quite a few India-Pakistan games, said pressure makes the rivalry what it is. The former seamer strongly believes that both pressure and passion can bring the best out of a player.""Right now, we are all guessing what will happen in this match. This is the beauty of it, what will happen. Nobody knows anything. So, in the same way, taking pressure is the job of the players. If you remove this pressure, what's left in the Pakistan-India game? Passion and pressure is what is needed to show a player his performance,"" said Aaqib.The heat is on Pakistan and the bar of expectations was raised by the country's Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif when he said that the real task for the team would be to not only win the Champions Trophy, but also beat India. The first part of the ""real task"" didn't get off to an ideal start as the hosts lost their opening game to New Zealand. If they fail to complete the second part of the task - beat India - the hosts could well be on their way out of the tournament in just five days!But pressure can do funny things and both sides are well aware of that. When the coin goes up for the toss and deafening cheers take over, the contest will certainly be decided by how the high pressure situations are dealt.",India take on Pakistan in the Champions Trophy in Dubai on Sunday. India's last defeat to Pakistan came in the 2017 Champions Trophy final. India vice-captain Shubman Gill feels the team which handles pressure better will take the win. Pakistan head coach Aaqib Javed believes pressure and passion can bring the best out of a player.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118485946,imgsize-168344,width-400,resizemode-4/118485946.jpg"
Rahul Dravid partners son Anvay with the bat in KSCA league comeback,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/rahul-dravid-partners-son-anvay-with-the-bat-in-ksca-league-comeback/articleshow/118485525.cms,"Rahul Dravid with spinner AR Ullas, who claimed his wicket on Saturday

Bengaluru: During the centenary celebration of Bangalore United Cricket Club (BUCC) a few years ago, former India captain and coach Rahul Dravid had said: “I love the buzz, vibe, camaraderie and the friendship at club cricket . I went back to playing league cricket because I wanted to repay to the game. It is important to be involved and interested in the club or stay interested in what it is doing.”On Saturday, his love for club cricket yet again came to the fore as the current head coach of IPL franchise Rajasthan Royals responded to the allure of 22 yards in the KSCA division III league at SLS Kreedangana here — making a comeback to league cricket after 12 years.Cricketers from the Young Lions Club, who had turned up for their match against Vijaya Cricket Club , Malur, were in for a huge surprise as the Vijaya CC line-up included an interesting father-son duo: Rahul Dravid and his younger son Anvay.It’s not often that one gets to see a father and son play for the same team and the novelty factor goes several notches higher with Dravid Senior returning to league cricket.While the father is one of the finest batsmen India has ever produced and a T20 World Cup-winning coach, sons Samit and Anvay have represented Karnataka in age-group cricket.A couple of months into his international retirement in 2013, Rahul had featured in a crucial match for his childhood club Bangalore United Cricket Club (BUCC) in the second division league.For Saturday’s match, Rahul, who has a registered KSCA UID, had signed up for the league on Wednesday.After Young Lions put Vijaya CC into bat, Anvay, the wicketkeeper-batter, scored a well-crafted 60-ball 58, while Rahul scored 10 before being dismissed by off-spinner AR Ullas. In a bid to accelerate the scoring in the 48th over, Rahul lofted a delivery from Ullas towards the long-off boundary, but was caught by Vivek Naik.The father-son combination shared a 15-ball, 17-run partnership.Speaking to TOI about the prized wicket of Rahul, Ullas, who had played against the legend in the past, said: “We got to know that Rahul sir was playing only when we reached the ground. We are both excited and nervous to play against him. Claiming the wicket of Rahul sir was a dream come true.”Rahul, who offered words of encouragement to the players after the match, told Ullas: “In all these years your bowling hasn’t changed.”Vijaya CC, riding on Swapnil Yelave’s 50-ball 107, posted 345/7 in 50 overs. Rahul then took the field with his teammates, fielding mostly in the slip cordon with his son Anvay behind the stumps in a match that Vijaya CC won by 24 runs.Vijaya CC have made the semifinals, but it is not known whether Rahul will feature in the match, the date for which is yet to be finalised.Rahul is expected to return to the Rajasthan Royals IPL team camp shortly.","Former India captain and coach Rahul Dravid returns to league cricket after 12 years.

Champions Trophy: Lalchand Rajput on what to expect in India vs Pakistan | On Rohit, Kohli's form

Saturday was supposed to be a light intensity training day for the Indian cricket team ahead of the big game versus Pakistan in the Champions Trophy They were given an afternoon slot but to everyone's surprise, the Men in Blue arrived early at the ICC Academy , and Virat Kohli arrived even earlier. Around 11am local time, there was an unusual buzz around the entrance of the training facility as Kohli got off a car with batting coach Sitanshu Kotak and throw-down specialists Nuwan and Raghu. Most weren't expecting an early arrival and the Indian team, too, came around 12pm local time, an hour earlier than the scheduled time.By the time everyone finished their warm-up and stretching routine, Virat Kohli was done batting after close to 45 minutes. The senior batter removed his gear and relaxed as his teammates got down to business. With the airpods plugged in, he put his feet up and had an ice pack on the left leg, possibly for some soreness. Chats with Rohit Sharma and Shubman Gill followed and Kohli was soon part of the team huddle where the captain gave the pep talk.Everyone took turns to do their bit for close to two hours but intensity remained light due to intense heat. Rohit, Gill and KL Rahul had short hits while quicks Harshit Rana and Mohammed Shami had it easy. While Rana had a hit with the bat, Shami strolled around and then went to the gym for a light session. Hardik Pandya spent time batting and middle-order batter Shreyas Iyer faced throw-downs from batting coach Sitanshu Kotak.There was no visible pattern in their approach and everyone just did their bit to stay ready for the Sunday clash. It wasn't a surprise to see the Men in Blue train the way they did as there wasn't a lot of time between their game vs Bangladesh and Pakistan. Rohit Sharma and Co. didn't train on Friday and wrapped up their session in under two hours on Saturday.While all India players were in attendance, wicketkeeper-batter Rishabh Pant wasn't part of the side's training session. It was later revealed by vice-captain Shubman Gill that Pant was down with viral fever. The youngster is not part of India's Playing XI plans at the moment as the management has continued to put their weight behind KL Rahul.Rahul, who had a successful 2023 ODI World Cup campaign, did well in the third ODI versus England and stitched a match-winning partnership with Gill in the Champions Trophy game vs Bangladesh.India were in a spot of bother when they were reduced to 144/4 but Rahul and Gill ensured there were no more casualties and helped the side cross the finish line with six wickets in hand.",The Men in Blue arrived early at the ICC Academy in Dubai. Virat Kohli was done batting after close to 45 minutes. Wicketkeeper-batter Rishabh Pant wasn't part of the side's training session.

NEW DELHI: Pakistan head coach Aaqib Javed has shown confidence in his pace bowling unit comprising Shaheen Shah Afridi, Naseem Shah and Haris Rauf ahead of must-win Champions Trophy match against India, saying that the trio will pull off 'something very special' on Sunday in Dubai.The defending champions face additional pressure as Fakhar Zaman, who led them to victory in the 2017 Champions Trophy final against India, will miss the match due to injury.""Look, there is no doubt Fakhar is a match winner. Every team actually misses their match winners. But you can't depend on only one player. We'll still play as a good, strong team, try to win and try to play good, positive cricket,"" Javed told media here on Saturday.""I've heard (that) a lot discussions (are) going on (that) other teams have too many spinners and we have lesser spinning options. The teams play their game on their own strengths.""We have like three, I would say, one of the best pace bowling options in today's game with Shaheen, Naseem and Haris. It reminds me of that 1990s troika (including Wasim Akram and Waqar Younis),"" he said.Javed acknowledged that the current pace bowlers still need time to reach the level of their legendary predecessors.""I think reaching at that level, they still have time, but they have all the ability to repeat those sort of performances. So, (we are) pretty much confident and when you play against India, it's a special feeling and they will bring something very special tomorrow,"" he said.The match is crucial for Pakistan after their opening loss to New Zealand in Karachi, as another defeat could impact their semifinals chances severely.""Look, there is no game you can say you play without pressure. The first game we lost, okay, New Zealand being a very strong team. After losing a game, there is another good chance for you to win (the second) and win the third one and make it to the semis,"" he said.""If you look at the positives, I think that (it) is the best time and best chance for any individual or a team to make a mark. We used to love it (playing India back in the day) and all the players are waiting for the opportunity to rise above the bar,"" he said.India started their tournament campaign strongly with a six-wicket victory over Bangladesh on a slow pitch.""Taking pressure is the job of the players. If you remove pressure, then what's left in a Pakistan-India game? A player needs such pressure and passion to showcase his performances,"" said Javed.While India have plenty of spin bowling options in their 15-member squad, Pakistan are dependent on their pace bowlers and Javed said they will back the squad the tournament hosts have picked.""As far as you are saying that India has a plan to try 3-4 spinners, that is their plan. We have to play our cricket on our own strengths,"" he said.""In our team, you won't see a lot of changes. We have selected a team with some thought, one that we believe in and we will back that team and our fast bowling options are the best. They are match winners.""India were forced to change gears in their chase of a modest 229 against Bangladesh which they achieved in the 47th over, giving them a fair idea of the nature of the surface, but Javed denied Rohit Sharma's team has any extra advantage having played a game here.""On this pitch, if you study the (last) match, there was a slight turn, there was a little seam (movement) with the new ball, and it was good for batting as well. It's a very balanced (and) supporting pitch.""","Pakistan head coach Aaqib Javed confident in pace bowling unit. Shaheen Shah Afridi, Naseem Shah and Haris Rauf will pull off'something very special' on Sunday. Defending champions face additional pressure as Fakhar Zaman will miss the match due to injury.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118483954,imgsize-70454,width-400,resizemode-4/118483954.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Former cricketer Sanjay Manjrekar wants Virat Kohli to 'settle his mind' and not over do things in practice ahead of India's crucial match against Pakistan in the Champions Trophy in Dubai on Sunday.Kohli, who has recently faced challenges against spin bowling in ODI cricket, spent extended hours practicing against spinners in the nets on Saturday, arriving earlier than his teammates.Following Kohli's dismissal by Bangladesh spinner Rishad Hossain in the opening match, cricket legend Sunil Gavaskar had expressed worry about Kohli's current form.""When you (Kohli) are slightly out of form and runs, you think of practising too much and thinking too much... sometimes (you) just over do it. Just keep hitting the balls in the nets. It's more of mind thing (and) not (just) about (the) batting technique,"" said JioHotstar expert Manjrekar in a virtual interaction.""He is going through a difficult time, and has (had) some technical issues... in the last match he lacked confidence but he is trying his best. He just needs to settle his mind a little bit without trying too hard, and go out there with a relaxed mind,"" Manjrekar added.Manjrekar also commented on Rishabh Pant's 'sorry situation' as India continue with KL Rahul as their wicketkeeper-batter.""India were pretty good (against Bangladesh), most boxes got ticked. I don't see drastic changes if the pitch is doesn't demand. Kuldeep (Yadav) needs a little more game time. Rahul got some runs, so I don't think any new wicketkeeper-batter is going to replace him,"" he said.""Till Rahul is contributing, Pant will stay out but Pant is rare talent for India. It's a sorry situation for him.""Manjrekar expressed confidence in India's chances against Pakistan, provided their opponents improve their performance.""India is looking really good. Pakistan's bowling didn't make an impression on me, the spinners didn't improve, Shaheen (Shah Afridi) needs to lift his game. They need a little bit of tweaking here and there. Pakistan has to raise their game by leaps and by bounds to win,"" he said.Manjrekar praised opener Shubman Gill's performance, who scored an unbeaten 101 runs against Bangladesh.""The form he is in, I (have) already predicted that he will become player of the tournament,"" he said.",Former cricketer Sanjay Manjrekar wants Virat Kohli to'settle his mind' and not over do things in practice.

Shambolic defending

Liverpool, Feb 22, 2025 -Bruno Fernandes inspired a Manchester United rally from two goals down to avoid another damaging defeat for Ruben Amorim in a 2-2 draw at Everton on Saturday.United were headed for a ninth defeat in their last 13 league games as goals from Beto and Abdoulaye Doucoure put the Toffees 2-0 up inside 33 minutes.The visitors had not mustered a shot on target until Fernandes' free-kick pulled a goal back 18 minutes from time before Manuel Ugarte's equaliser salvaged a point for United.More late drama was to come as Everton were awarded a penalty deep into stoppage time, only for referee Andy Madley to overturn his decision after a VAR review.A point edges Everton up to 12th, while United remain in 15th.Everton were in a battle for survival when David Moyes returned for his second spell in charge last month, but they have taken 14 points from a possible 18 in their last six games to ensure their 71-year stay in the top flight will not come to an end.Amorim conceded before the game that Moyes, who himself was sacked after less than a season in charge of United in 2014, was doing a better job than he has managed since arriving from Sporting Lisbon in November.When the sides last met in Amorim's first home league game, United cruised to a 4-0 win at Old Trafford, but he has managed just three victories in 13 Premier League games since.Everton have just five more matches to come at Goodison Park before they move to a new 53,000-capacity stadium next season.The home fans and team are determined to make the most of what is left at the club's home since 1892 and put a United side lacking in confidence under pressure from the off.But when Everton did take the lead on 19 minutes it was thanks to comedic United defending.The Red Devils had multiple chances to deal with a corner into the box before the ball eventually broke for Beto to fire into the ground and over Andre Onana.The striker has been transformed since Moyes' return, scoring five times in his last four Premier League appearances after netting just four times in his first 44 for the club.Beto also had a big part to play in the second as his run in behind opened up the United defence before he fed Jack Harrison with a low cross.Onana could only parry Harrison's shot into the air and Doucoure outmuscled Harry Maguire to head in the loose ball.Doucoure was denied a second by a fine save from Onana as Everton looked to build on their lead early in the second half.But, not for the first time, Fernandes was United's one source of inspiration.The Portugal international's free-kick wrong-footed Jordan Pickford to kickstart the fightback.Another Fernandes free-kick was the source of the equaliser as this time Ugarte pounced on Beto's headed clearance to fire in his first goal for the club.Both sides had chances to win it in a thrilling finale.Beto planted a header from close range too close to Onana, while Pickford tipped over Fernandes' dipping effort from the edge of the box.United, though, were fortunate to escape in added time when Ashley Young looked to have been pulled down by a combination of Maguire and Matthijs de Ligt.The referee pointed to the spot but was instructed to take a second look and overturned his decision to save Amorim from further embarrassment.",Manchester United held to 2-2 draw by Everton at Old Trafford. Goals from Beto and Abdoulaye Doucoure put Toffees 2-0 up. Bruno Fernandes free-kick pulled United level 18 minutes from time.

Rubiales, aged 47, subsequently took his case to CAS, the highest sports tribunal.The CAS panel concluded that his conduct during the awards ceremony ""constituted multiple and serious violations of the FIFA Disciplinary Code"" and validated the punishment as appropriate.""The appeal sought to set the contested decision aside, or in the alternative to set it partially aside and amend the sanction, or in the further alternative, apply any other disciplinary measures,"" stated CAS in their announcement.""The appeal by Mr Rubiales is dismissed and the contested decision is maintained.""In a separate development on Thursday, the Spanish High Court found Rubiales liable for sexual assault over the non-consensual kiss and ordered him to pay a fine exceeding €10,000 ($10,454).The verdict additionally barred Rubiales, who previously led the Spanish Football Federation (RFEF), from approaching within 200 metres of Hermoso.","Court of Arbitration for Sport reject Luis Rubiales' appeal against FIFA ban.

PANAJI: On a flight from Goa to Mumbai last week, FC Goa coach Manolo Marquez had some advice for goalkeeper Lara Sharma .FC Goa were flying to Mumbai for their Indian Super League (ISL) clash and the goalkeeper and coach were seated next to each other. Manolo told Lara: ""You will arrive where your mind wants you to. You can be very good technically, tactically, physically, but if you are not strong enough here (in the mind), you won't make progress.""Lara needed to hear those words.On the sidelines for nine months with an ACL injury he picked up last season, Lara returned to the first team in December but soon realised he still had plenty of ground to cover with his fitness. Manolo also admitted he could have erred in rushing back the goalkeeper too soon, and it's only now that the 25-year-old has been part of the match-day squad for the last three games.Lara is yet to make an appearance for FC Goa, who he joined this season, but knows he must be ready whenever called into action.""I don't know when my chance will come, but whenever I get a chance (to play), I know I have to come up with good performance,"" Lara told TOI during the pre-match media interaction on Friday. ""It does not matter whether I get a chance tomorrow, after a month, two months or even next season. But whenever I play, I have to do well. I have to be patient.""It hasn't been an easy ride for Lara in the Indian Super League (ISL).Having graduated from the famed Tata Football Academy (TFA), Lara had stints with Indian Arrows, India juniors and ATK reserves, before moving to Bengaluru FC where he was second choice to India goalkeeper Gurpreet Singh. Nobody raised an eyebrow when he was loaned to Kerala Blasters due to lack of game time, but just when things were beginning to look up, he picked up an injury in the playoff against Odisha FC.The injury turned out to be serious. It was Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) which needed surgery and a lengthy spell out of action.""It was difficult for me because I never had injuries in my life from the day I start playing football. This was a big injury, it was really, really difficult, especially the first three-four months when I was at home. For pre-season (with Goa), there were senior players like Sandesh (Jhingan), Odei (Onaindia), Iker (Guarrotxena) who motivated me. It helped me during the rehab. It was a difficult period but taught me a lot,"" said Lara.Lara was meant to be first choice goalkeeper for Goa, until the injury disrupted plans.Laxmikant Kattimani was then signed from Hyderabad and the experienced keeper grabbed the top spot. Hrithik Tiwari was forced into action only when Kattimani was injured and since then the youngster has given a good account of himself.Lara knows his time will come.""The team is performing good, Hrithik is also playing well. It's been tough for me (on the sidelines). When I returned in December, I thought the injury was gone, I'm good, but on the pitch it was different. When I spoke with the coach, he told me I need more time (to make a comeback), so I started seeing videos of my training sessions every day. I noticed I had to improve on some things.""Then there were doubts too whether the injury will reoccur. Speaking with someone like Sandesh helps a lot. He's always positive (with his words). He's always motivating and told me injuries are part of a footballer's life. Recovery takes time, it's a process and I'll return to the field (for a competitive game),"" said Lara.",Lara Sharma is yet to make an appearance for FC Goa this season. The 25-year-old has been part of the match-day squad for the last three games. Lara returned to the first team in December but soon realised he still had plenty of ground to cover with his fitness.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118466119,imgsize-50578,width-400,resizemode-4/118466119.jpg"

Liverpool 's unbeaten streak in the Premier League extended to 22 matches, but their second consecutive 2-2 draw, this time against Aston Villa , gives Arsenal renewed optimism in the title chase.Liverpool extended their advantage to eight points over Arsenal at the top of the leaderboard, but Arsenal now have played a match less.A point does little for Villa's hope of returning to the Champions League next season as they remain in ninth. A challenging fixture awaits Slot's squad as they prepare to face Manchester City away from home on Sunday.Initially ahead through Mohamed Salah's strike, Liverpool found themselves trailing after Youri Tielemans and Ollie Watkins turned the tide in Villa's favour.A deflected effort from Trent Alexander-Arnold brought Liverpool level, yet they should have secured all three points when Darwin Nunez squandered an excellent opportunity after coming off the bench.The hosts nearly snatched victory in the closing moments, with both Morgan Rogers and Donyell Malen coming close to finding the winner.An early opportunity for Villa saw Marcus Rashford's cross deflected into the net by Virgil van Dijk, but the effort was nullified due to Rashford being in an offside position.The breakthrough came at 29 minutes, though Villa were ultimately responsible for their own undoing. Diogo Jota intercepted Andres Garcia's poor backpass and generously set up Salah, who netted his 29th goal of the campaign.Within nine minutes, Villa equalised when Liverpool's inadequate clearance from a free-kick landed perfectly for Tielemans, who executed a skilful volley into the net.Jota squandered a golden opportunity to put the visitors ahead, sending his shot well off target despite being one-on-one with Emi Martinez.Villa capitalised on Liverpool's defensive lapse before the interval, as Watkins found himself unmarked to head Lucas Digne's cross into the distant corner.Liverpool dominated the second half proceedings, helping Slot maintain his unbeaten away record in the Premier League.Alexander-Arnold's increasing prominence in the match led to his equalising goal at 60 minutes, with a shot that deflected off Tyrone Mings.In pursuit of victory, Slot introduced Luis Diaz and Nunez as substitutes, with one of them having a clear opportunity to secure three crucial points.Presented with an unguarded net after Dominik Szoboszlai's pass, Nunez missed the target, leaving his manager visibly frustrated.",Liverpool held to a 2-2 draw by Aston Villa at Villa Park. Mohamed Salah and Youri Tielemans scored for Liverpool. Ollie Watkins and Trent Alexander-Arnold scored for Villa. Liverpool extended their lead at the top of the Premier League.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118402967,imgsize-43096,width-400,resizemode-4/118402967.jpg"

Bayern Munich clinched their spot in the Champions League's last 16 with a last-gasp goal against Celtic on Tuesday. The German giants will be joined by Club Brugge and Benfica , who also progressed to the next round. But it wasn't to be for AC Milan , who made a painful exit after a draw with Feyenoord .Bayern, who held a 2-1 advantage from the away leg, struggled to extend their lead at home. Harry Kane came close but struck the crossbar in the first half, while it was the visitors from Scotland who took a surprising lead after 63 minutes when Nicolas Kuehn, who previously played for Bayern, capitalised on Kim Min-jae's defensive error to slot the ball into the bottom corner.That meant the tie was heading for extra time, but Bayern ultimately would not need to go that far as they scored in the fourth minute of injury time.Davies scored from close range to level the match at 1-1, securing Bayern's progression with a 3-2 aggregate victory in the prestigious European competition.The draw scheduled for Friday will reveal whether Kompany's side faces Bayer Leverkusen or Atletico Madrid in the round of 16.Earlier, seven-time European Cup winners Milan were eliminated by Feyenoord, following their 1-1 draw at San Siro. It took the Dutch club through 2-1 on aggregate.Santiago Gimenez, facing his former team after his recent departure, scored from close proximity in the opening minute, bringing Milan level on aggregate.The match took a turn when Milan's Hernandez received his second yellow card early in the second period, resulting in his dismissal. Carranza equalised for Feyenoord with 73 minutes on the clock.In the closing moments, Feyenoord's Read was dismissed with a red card, though his team had already secured their progression in the tie.They now await to face either Inter Milan or Arsenal in the last-16 stage.In Lisbon, Benfica secured their progression despite a 3-3 home draw with Monaco, winning 4-3 on aggregate, setting up a clash with either Barcelona or Liverpool.The Portuguese side, who had secured a 1-0 away victory in the previous week, strengthened their position when Kerem Akturkoglu found the net halfway through the opening period.Monaco mounted a strong response as Takumi Minamino and Eliesse Ben Seghir scored before and after the interval, bringing the aggregate score level.Vangelis Pavlidis converted from the spot, marking his seventh goal in six Champions League appearances, levelling the match at 2-2, before Monaco's substitute George Ilenikhena responded with another goal.However, the tie swung decisively back towards Benfica as Orkun Kokcu made it 3-3 on the night in the 84th minute.Young sensation Chemsdine Talbi netted twice to help Club Brugge secure a 3-1 away win against Atalanta in Italy, sealing a comprehensive 5-2 aggregate victory.Following Talbi's double, Ferran Jutgla added a brilliant goal as the Belgian side built upon their 2-1 home advantage from the previous week's first leg. They will now face either Lille or Aston Villa in the round of 16.Despite Atalanta's 29 shots at goal, they fell victim to counter-attacks from the visitors, with Ademola Lookman's goal early in the second half providing little comfort.Lookman missed from the penalty spot and Atalanta skipper Rafael Toloi received a red card in the closing stages, leading to Atalant's elimination.","Bayern Munich secure their place in the Champions League's last 16 with a last- gasp goal against Celtic on Tuesday.

DUBAI: Fast is Mirra Andreeva 's pace. And on a day when the sun was out and the ball sat up the 17-year-old was letting it rip, nailing her spots, and in doing so, she took time away from her opponent Iga Swiatek , the world No.2.The 14th ran ked Russi an didn't put a foot wrong on court in the Dubai Duty Free tennis championship quarterfinals, not even when she trailed 1-3 in the second set. The Pole, a five-time major winner, sizzled on her returns in the third game, where she broke the teen for the only time in the match. Andreeva, who had 10 aces, saved seven of eight breakpoint chances, to score a 6-3, 6-3 upset win in 97 minutes.Thursday's result was the Russian's fifth top-10 win of her career, and the second against a top-two player, following her defeat of Aryna Sabalenka in last year's Roland Garros quarterfinals.Andreeva, articulate as her shots are telling, noted that the difference between her and the elite pros was experience; the teenager turned to her coach Conchita Martinez, the 1994 Wimbledon champion, to level the playing field.""I know that no matter what's happening on the court, they (top player s) are always going to play their best tennis, and they're going to keep up their level throughout the whole match. That's the main difficulty for players that are lower ranked,"" Andreeva said.""I tell myself to fight for every ball, doesn't matter what's happening on the court,"" she said. ""I knew if I don't play aggressive she's going to go and kill me. Everybody knows that she likes to take the ball early, she doesn't give time to her opponents. She always tries to be the first one to attack. My game plan was to play my game, sometimes I just forced myself to be more aggressive.""Martinez chalks the strategy Andreeva brings to the court. ""If she didn't give me great advice and tactics I don't think I would be playing at such a high level,"" Andreeva said of the 52-year-old Spaniard, who is a calming presence at courtside. ""We take about 15 to 20 minutes to talk about the match, set up the game plan. For example, today I played at 2 (pm), we spoke at 1. It's all still fresh in my head (when I go on court).""Swiatek, who usually has a strong couple of weeks in the WTA events in the Middle East, wasn't at her best this time, falling in the semifinals to Jelena Ostapenko in Doha, and in the last-eight here in Dubai, where she looked out of sorts. The world No.2 had 31 unforced errors in the match on Thursday.""I'm not happy with the results. I feel like I under-performed,"" she said of the two weeks in Doha and Dubai. ""I need to talk with my team and plan the next weeks a bit differently because I haven't had much time to practice before these tournaments. I felt that there were some things missing (with my tennis) that should have been there.""""I wasn't really sure where my ball is going to go,"" a visibly upset Swiatek said of the match. ""I wasn't as precise as I should be. Mirra is a good player. It's not like I can win against her when I play worse.""

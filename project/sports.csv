India's Test team has been staring at generational change for a while now. The murmurs of transition started with Cheteshwar Pujara and Ajinkya Rahane losing their places three years ago. When Gautam Gambhir was appointed head coach last year, it was perceived as a forward-thinking move meant to shake things up and usher in fresh blood. In that context, Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma's retirements may be perceived as part of the process the selection committee and management envisioned for the team.There seems to be only way ahead — invest heavily in talented youth who can form the core of the Test team in time. The returns are not to be judged immediately.This isn't an unfamiliar scenario in Indian cricket. When Sachin Tendulkar retired in 2013 within a year of Rahul Dravid and VVS Laxman calling it quits, the concerns were not too dissimilar. India went through the throes of transition for a good three years before becoming a force in Test cricket under Kohli's leadership.Former India wicketkeeper Saba Karim, a national selector at that time, says, ""We had MS Dhoni leading the team. He was clear how he wanted to shape the team and who were his best bets. There was clarity that we had to be ready to move on from Gautam Gambhir and Virender Sehwag. Dhoni was the most important person.""Kohli, Pujara and Rahane were all in and around the Test team. It helped that all three of them succeeded in South Africa in 2013 immediately after Tendulkar retired. The team wasn't winning but we were heading in the right direction. It was apparent that once Kohli took up the No. 4 position, he would form the core of the batting lineup,"" Karim told TOI.This time around, there's no obvious leader in the team. Coach Gambhir came in with the mandate to usher in changes at the earliest. Now it's time to execute those plans. ""Gambhir becomes the most important person here. He has to give confidence to the players. The first thing he needs to do is understand the new captain, the vision he has and the brand of cricket he wants the team to play,"" Karim said.Gambhir can now become the most powerful head coach India have ever had. In 2017, Anil Kumble tried to enforce himself but then-captain Kohli had the last word. Yet, Gambhir has to tread carefully here. ""Gambhir has clear ideas about how he wants his team to approach a game. But he needs to be the man who empowers players and creates leaders in the team. I'm sure he'll back someone like Rishabh Pant, who hit a rough patch in Australia, and give him more confidence on the upcoming, tough tour of England,"" former national selector Devang Gandhi said.It's not just about filling the void left by Rohit and Kohli. Not too long ago, India boasted of an enviable bowling attack that could hurt opposition teams irrespective of the nature of pitches and conditions. The famed pace attack of Ishant Sharma, Mohammed Shami and Umesh Yadav were handed the mantle starting from 2012-13.""Those bowlers, including Bhuvneshwar Kumar, were identified for the longer run. They initially struggled to bowl out opposition batters even overseas. But the idea was to zero in on a pool of bowlers and keep working with them. Credit must go to Kohli for turning things around when he decided to play five bowlers in Tests. That regulated the workload of the pacers and became a metric going forward. Similarly, if you have identified the likes of Harshit Rana, Prasidh Krishna, Akash Deep and Arshdeep, then stick with the pool,"" Karim said.Gandhi revisited the process of creating a strong backup in 2020 with the help of Rahul Dravid, who looked after the NCA and India's developmental sides. ""The primary job of our selection committee was to create bench strength. I went to eight ‘A' tours as a selector and had robust discussions with Dravid. Mohammed Siraj, Shardul Thakur and Navdeep Saini were ready to step up. India has to focus on red-ball ‘A' tours. The white-ball team will take care of itself because we have such a strong tournament like the IPL,"" Gandhi said.In all the hype around the pace attack, one may have ignored the lack of resources in the spin-bowling department. ""We chose R Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja to lead the spin attack and it paid off. Probably, they need to give Kuldeep Yadav more game time and groom the likes of Sai Kishore and Washington Sundar,"" Karim said.It's going to be a tough road ahead for India's Test team. Persistence and patience seem to be the need of the hour.",Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma have retired from Test cricket. Head coach Gautam Gambhir is now the most powerful figure in India's setup.

Explained: Why Rohit Sharma retired from Test cricket

Unifying a team for a common cause

Bombay Sport Exchange Ep 5: Shane Watson on IPL, India-Australia rivalry | Part 1

A two-hour talkathon

""Let's give them 60 overs of hell!"" Years down the line, when historians will revisit Indian Test cricket in the 21st century, Virat Kohli's war cry at the Lord's in 2021 will ring in their ears.That London summer afternoon defined the Kohli-way — a new era of self-belief when India refused to throw in the towel even when the chips were down.The team, after a miraculous ninth-wicket partnership between Jasprit Bumrah and Mohammed Shami on the fifth morning, could have veered towards the safer confines of an honourable draw.But the captain didn't believe in settling for a draw, even while playing overseas. The 151-run win on that day was the highest point for Kohli the captain — arguably a more remarkable figure than Kohli the batter, at least in Test cricket.That day, the basis of that confidence to push for a win at Lord's lay in the belief that Kohli had in his pace quartet of Bumrah, Shami, Mohammed Siraj and Ishant Sharma. It was an attack that was meticulously curated by Kohli and coach Ravi Shastri, with the help of bowling coach Bharath Arun.In many ways, Kohli's decision to rely on out-and-out pace was a leaf out of a decision that the young Mansur Ali Khan Pataudi took as captain in the 1960s, to rely on a magnificent battery of spinners to churn out results.In Bishan Singh Bedi, Erapalli Prasanna and BS Chandrasekhar, Pataudi had a supremely gifted trio. S Venkataraghavan, who made his debut in 1965, was made a regular part of the spin attack as India played with four spinners for the first time at Edgbaston in 1967.Playing in tandem, the quartet restricted England to 298 and 203, only to be let down by the batters. But they laid a marker that was to define Indian cricket for the next decade, aptly summed up by Kapil Dev in Tim Wigmore's Test Cricket: A History: ""Almost every Indian bowler in that era wanted to be a spinner.""Half a century later, in 2018, Kohli took the call to play four pacers in Perth. Much like Pataudi's Edgbaston experience, India lost that Test despite the skipper scoring a magnificent century, but India had well and truly taken a step in a different direction.As Prasanna and Bedi have insisted that ""playing under Tiger was no strain"", the likes of Ishant Sharma and Shami flourished under Kohli. But the captain's biggest contribution will be the 'Kohinoor' he gifted to Indian Test cricket — Bumrah, the pace parallel of the maverick leggie Chandrasekhar.The slinger was superb in white-ball cricket, but no one believed he could last the rigours of Test cricket till Kohli and Shastri decided otherwise. The duo nurtured him and introduced him to Test cricket in South Africa in 2018. It would prove the birth of the 'Bradman of pace bowling' — termed by Adam Gilchrist — as India took their first step towards world domination in red-ball cricket, culminating in two back-to-back series wins in Australia.Pataudi, as Indian captain, had brought in a unification code to a largely disjointed team. ""Our side was dominated by players from the West and South and it was difficult for a Punjabi like myself to be accepted. But it was Tiger who gave us the feeling of Indian-ness,"" Bedi says in Wigmore's book.Fifty years down the line, Kohli, too, tried to unify the team through a common code — fitness. He learnt early that to excel in 21st century cricket, fitness had to be of a different level. He brought changes to his lifestyle and diet to himself become the lean, mean machine.He also tried to instill the same in his team, to follow a similar mantra. It meant that the envelope was pushed. If the pace bowlers, on the final session of the final day, were ready to bowl 140 km/hr, a lot to do with the culture of fitness that was brought in by Kohli.Kohli didn't mind the odd exchange of words with the opposition on the field, but there's one instance when his anger was channelized towards his own team. According to a member of the management, Kohli was livid with the way India capitulated in the first Test in Cape Town, chasing 208.""Vernon Philander destroyed us with his medium-pace in the second innings, Kohli couldn't take it anymore. We never heard him speaking as harshly as he did to the team members — for about two hours on that day. He made it clear that such a performance was just not acceptable. By the time we got into the team bus, we knew something had to be changed,"" a team member told TOI.Kohli walked the talk in the next Test in Centurion with a century, albeit in a losing cause. But India won the third Test on a minefield in Johannesburg. The first step towards world domination had been taken.",Virat Kohli's decision to rely on out-and-out pace was a leaf out of a decision that the young Mansur Ali Khan Pataudi took as captain in the early 1960s. India played with four spinners for the first time at Edgbaston in 1967. It would prove the birth of the 'Bradman of pace bowling' — termed by Adam Gilchrist.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121151924,imgsize-37812,width-400,resizemode-4/Virat-Kohli.jpg"

Poll Do you believe Kohli's retirement will affect India's Test team performance? No, the team will adapt Yes, it's a huge loss

NEW DELHI: As the cricketing world comes to terms with Virat Kohli ’s sudden retirement from Test cricket , tributes continue to pour in for a player widely regarded as one of the finest to ever don the whites for India. Kohli, who announced his retirement via a social media post on Monday — ""#269, signing off"" — brought an end to a glorious 14-year red-ball career.The former India captain finishes with 9,230 runs in 123 Tests, including 30 centuries, and a formidable legacy as India’s most successful Test captain with 40 wins in 68 matches. But beyond the numbers, many believe Kohli’s impact goes far deeper — he filled two massive voids left by legends Sachin Tendulkar and MS Dhoni Former India cricketer Robin Uthappa summed up Kohli’s dual legacy aptly on Star Sports: ""He wore two crowns when he landed in Test cricket. India needed an incredible batter after Sachin Tendulkar and a great captain after MS Dhoni. Interestingly, Virat filled both those shoes. That is his legacy in Test cricket.""Former teammate Suresh Raina echoed similar sentiments, praising Kohli’s unmatched intensity and leadership.""The fitness, fighting spirit, and the brand he has become — I haven’t seen a player like him,"" Raina said. He recalled Kohli’s debut in the West Indies, facing the fiery pace of Fidel Edwards and Ravi Rampaul, saying, ""He didn’t care about the helmet being hit. He wanted to play strongly. That attitude is what changed the table for India. He’s one of the best.""Raina also highlighted Kohli’s transformational leadership in historic overseas victories, especially in Australia and South Africa — tours that defined India's modern Test dominance.With Kohli now walking away from the longest format, Indian cricket loses a figure who didn’t just play — he carried the team with charisma, grit, and a ferocious will to win.","Former India captain Virat Kohli retires from Test cricket after 14 years.

Virat Kohli retires from Test cricket after 14 years

Explained: Why Rohit Sharma retired from Test cricket

Bombay Sport Exchange Ep 5: Shane Watson on IPL, India-Australia rivalry | Part 1

Indian cricket bears shades of the rebuilding phase of Australian cricket in the mid-1980s. R Ashwin Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli all played their last Tests in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy in Australia.In 1983-84, three Aussie greats played their last Test in the home series against Pakistan. With Kim Hughes at the helm, wicketkeeper Rod Marsh, premier batter Greg Chappell and pace legend Dennis Lillee, all called it a day after the Sydney Test.Chappell made his intentions clear after the second day of the Test. Lillee echoed the same later that evening. Marsh made his unavailability clear for the next series before the conclusion of that last Test.Cut to 2024-25. Ashwin played the Adelaide Test and left the tour a few days later after not being picked for the third Test in Brisbane. Kohli's last Test was also the last of that series, in Sydney. Rohit's last Test, as it turned out, would be MCG's Boxing Day Test.While the contributions of Ashwin, Rohit and Kohli in whites are of high value, all three were struggling in Tests of late. Ashwin's inclusion in away Tests was always in doubt when India played with a lone spinner.Rohit was a Test cricket survivor and opportunist. In Australia, England and South Africa, his figures read 45 innings, one hundred and five fifties.As for Kohli, his angular vertical bat pointing towards mid-on while deciding whether to play or leave deliveries outside the off stump was a painful sight Down Under.India, however, will miss them. After all, it is not easy for a team to replace quality regulars and still retain composure and consistency. When Marsh-Greg-Lillee called it quits, Australia went through a lengthy rebuilding process under Allan Border. They won their first major series — the 1989 Ashes in England — four-and-a-half years later! In between, they lost to West Indies thrice, to England and NZ twice each, lost in Pakistan and could not beat India over a couple of series.While India are expected to face a bumpy road ahead in Tests, the situation doesn't seem that alarming. To expect a Test series win against either South Africa, Australia, England or New Zealand won't be beyond reach — an unlikely plus from the mingling of world stars and young Indian players through white-ball cricket. Unlike in the 1980s, the young Indians are not short on confidence or in awe of rival teams either, an ethos drilled by the leadership of Kohli and Rohit.The Greg-Marsh-Lillee exit void was certainly bigger than the current Indian one. India are expected to be served well by KL Rahul, Rishabh Pant, Jasprit Bumrah and Shubman Gill in Tests, even though the five-Test tour of England is a tough assignment. Chief selector Ajit Agarkar and coach Gautam Gambhir will have to tackle the captaincy issue prudently. The Aussies continued with Kim Hughes for seven more Tests before Allan Border replaced him midway against the West Indies in 1984-85.India will have to name a new captain right away. When Rohit was not available for the opening Test, India won under Bumrah. When Kohli was unavailable after Adelaide's ‘36 all out' fiasco in 2020-21, India went on to win the series under Ajinkya Rahane. No one is indispensable, be it Rohit Sharma or Virat Kohli.","Ashwin, Rohit and Kohli's departure has shades of the Chappell-Marsh-Lillee exit in Australia, which triggered a long rebuilding phase.

Virat Kohli drops retirement bombshell | Virat Kohli retires from Test cricket

When we talk about Virat Kohli , Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) and dressing room stories, one name that immediately comes to mind is AB de Villiers , given the kind of bond they have shared over the years. But last week, everyone was in for a pleasant surprise when Virat Kohli credited former South African wicketkeeper-batter Mark Boucher for guiding him during the early years of his international and Indian Premier League (IPL) career. ""Actually, of all the players I played with initially, Mark Boucher had the biggest impact on me,"" Kohli told the ‘RCB Bold Diaries’ podcast. The duo spent three years at RCB.In 2008, Mark Boucher saw Kohli’s potential and told him he would be doing a disservice to himself if he failed to make it to the senior Indian team. He took a young 20-year-old under his wings, helped him practice during net sessions and become battle-ready for the bouncy tracks in South Africa and Australia.""I just tried to help him in his development at that particular stage. He had everything in his game. I think the one thing we did talk about was the short ball and how to play the short ball,"" Boucher said in a conversation on Monday (May 12), the day Kohli announced his retirement from Test cricket ""I think the short ball is something that a youngster always gets tested with. I told him, 'Virat, because you're so good off the front foot when the ball's straight, they're going to test you on the back foot when you arrive on the international scene. If you play it well, very quickly they'll go away from bowling short at you'. I just said to him, 'if you arrive on South African shores, we would definitely test you on the short ball knowing that you come from the subcontinent.'""'When you go to Australia, they're definitely going to test you on the short ball because you've come from the subcontinent.' I think my conversations were just trying to help him find his next level and making him aware of what other teams would do to him. From there, he took it upon himself.""""He said to me, 'Bach, can you help me?' I was like, 'Yes, absolutely.' I went and served a couple of tennis balls at him, showed him one or two little techniques. I just worked on a couple of things, tried to impart a little bit of my knowledge on playing the short ball, especially coming from South Africa where you get tested quite a bit.""I did say to him one day, it's not a nice exercise to go into a net and have to work on the short ball because sometimes you do get hurt. Sometimes you get one or two balls around the ears, and it's not nice having to go through that and getting hit on the helmet every now and again. But I think this is where his feistiness and his character came through. He was really eager to become a better cricketer. He really enjoyed the challenge of me hitting tennis balls at his head.""We had a laugh, and it was good fun because I think he trusted that it was coming from a good place from my side. I really enjoyed it because here I am working with someone who at that stage I thought could be the next superstar in Indian cricket. He's lived up to that.""Boucher vividly remembers the first time he met Virat and how the ""feistiness"" in a young Delhi lad caught his attention and reminded him of a younger version of himself.""He was, how do I put it, quite an easy person to speak to. He was very open to listening to people who were older than him and probably more experienced than him. He had a bit – it's difficult to say attitude because attitude comes across the wrong way – but he had a character that he was quite feisty and out there. He loved to be competitive, which I really enjoyed about him because I think I was probably similar when I was a youngster,"" recalls Boucher.""What did stand out was his talent that he had, and if you've got talent and you've got character that comes with it and the feistiness to want to succeed, I think it's always a recipe for success,"" he adds.A young Virat made the most out of Boucher's experience and their initial conversations continued to revolve around cricket. The former cricketer still remembers the chat they had on the art of playing spin, and how it left a lasting impression on Boucher.""I actually chatted to him a lot about spin bowling and how Indian cricketers play spin bowling to try and pick his brain a bit on how they develop from a very young age and what sort of techniques they have to counter the spinning ball,"" he says.""I actually remember the conversation that we had, and it went along the lines of, I just said, 'Virat, you're very talented and you're very young.' You've got the IPL ahead of you now. You're probably going to play close to 20 years of IPL cricket. Sachin Tendulkar started off at a very young age as well, and who's to say that you couldn't be the next Sachin Tendulkar?' I didn't know that he was going to take everything this far and sort of create his own legacy.""Over the years, Virat Kohli carried the burden of being the next Sachin Tendulkar but Boucher staunchly believes it is unfair to compare Tendulkar and Kohli. He sums it up with a crisp response: ""To mention him and Sachin would be doing a disservice to both of them. I think there's only ever one Sachin Tendulkar, and I think there's only ever one Virat Kohli. Both of them are absolute legends of the game.""When it comes to Kohli , a lot of tags have followed him over the years. From being termed arrogant to egoistic, the former India skipper had to deal with a lot of outside noise during his Test career but he managed to deliver the results which were never seen in Indian cricket before. It was under his captaincy that India witnessed a glorious period in Test cricket where they won 40 of the 68 games Kohli led in, losing just 17. The 40 wins made Kohli India's most successful Test captain of all time.""When he stepped into the Indian cricket team, the way that he led people, I think sometimes people were saying it was arrogance, but I don't see it as arrogance. I see it as confidence and also a particular guy who's got a little bit of a different attitude to maybe your normal Indian cricketer. He was never going to stand back and be bullied or pushed into a corner by any other cricketer, which is right,"" says Boucher.""No cricketer should stand back, especially if you're playing for your country. You've earned the right to play for your country, and so has the individual on the other end. There should never be a situation where you feel like you need to be undermined by the opposition. If you can take it, you can give it back. If you give it, you must be able to take it as well. I think Virat was very much like that,"" he adds.Boucher further explains how that Virat inspired the current generation of cricketers with his ""in your face"" attitude. The feistiness, fitness and overall dedication have been hallmarks of Kohli's career and it has rubbed off on the future players as well.""Certainly, he started what the younger generation is now living through as well. They don't stand back for anyone. They're very aggressive. They're in your face. There's a line for everything. You don't want to cross the line or the legality of the game.""But certainly, they go out there, and they don't feel intimidated by anyone. Where maybe in the past, before the Kohli era, maybe there was a little bit of intimidation that crept in. He certainly changed that and changed the way that any young Indian cricketer being brought up in today's world, they're a lot tougher.""Kohli and his old friend ""Bach"" continue to be in touch after all these years but the conversations have now moved on from short-pitch bowling to family and fatherhood.",Virat Kohli announced his retirement from Test cricket on May 12.

Virat Kohli retires from Test cricket after 14 years. Where do India go from here?

Poll What aspect of Virat Kohli's career do you admire the most? His sportsmanship Consistency in performance Leadership qualities His batting skills

NEW DELHI: A young Virat Kohli , just 12 years old, riding on the back of his father Prem Nath Kohli's scooter with his kit bag perched on the front, is an image that former India cricketer Atul Wassan will always remember. Wassan, who had represented India in four Tests and nine ODIs, was at his friend Rajkumar Sharma's academy in Paschim Vihar, Delhi. It was a Sunday morning, years ago, when a chubby-cheeked Virat arrived with his father and brother, Vikas.Like every other student, Virat and his brother were asked to pad up and face a few deliveries. One shot, then another, and another. After about ten shots, Wassan and Rajkumar exchanged a glance and jokingly said, “Virat Kohli ko chhod do, dusre bhai ko padha likha lo [Leave Virat here, focus on educating the other brother].""Little did they know that moment marked the beginning of Virat's journey to greatness, and Wassan would soon take the reins to nurture this talented young cricketer.Eight years after their first meeting, Wassan chose Virat to represent Delhi in a Ranji Trophy match against Tamil Nadu at home in 2006. And over time, that 12-year-old kid evolved into a legend of the game.“I do remember him clearly. He came to our academy with Rajkumar and me when he was just 12 years old. I still recall that moment. Even back then, he had something special. However, we never imagined he’d reach such incredible heights. No one could predict it,"" Wassan told TimesofIndia.com.""I remember the first time I toured with Sachin Tendulkar; he was 16. Virat was also special, but even with talent, no one can guarantee success. Many factors have to fall into place. The genius lies in maintaining focus and consistently taking the next step. Just having talent isn’t enough. Many have talent, but to sustain it, to evolve, and to remain grounded amid commercialisation, while excelling in all formats, with different pressures — it's rare. When everything falls into place, you get talents like Tendulkar and Virat,” he said.“Rajkumar first spotted this boy. He insisted and said ‘no, you must come and see this kid.’ So, I agreed. When I saw him, I knew there was something special about him. It’s hard to explain, but you can just tell when someone has the ‘X-factor.’ His brother and father came too. He said, ‘Just wait for a minute,’ and that’s when we knew he had potential,” Wassan said.After India clinched the T20 World Cup 2024 title, Virat announced his retirement almost immediately. However, his decision to retire from Test cricket left fans heartbroken, particularly as he was expected to play in England.""I’m walking away with a heart full of gratitude — for the game, for the people I shared the field with, and for every single person who made me feel seen along the way,"" Virat wrote on Instagram.Yes, the Baggy Blue #269 will no longer grace the field.Virat concluded his Test career with 9,230 runs in 123 matches, including 30 centuries and 31 fifties. He finished as the fourth-highest run-scorer for India, behind Sachin Tendulkar , Rahul Dravid, and Sunil Gavaskar.""He’s played and conquered the game, and now he’s enjoying his IPL career, staying supremely fit. Test cricket, though, demands a lot mentally and physically, and not everyone has the mindset to endure that. Virat understands that. He wants to enjoy life and has nothing more to prove. He’ll keep playing IPL and maybe even aim for the Olympics. He wants to play the Olympics. Ultimately, a player knows himself better than anyone else,"" Wassan said.“People keep talking about the 700-800 runs he needs for 10,000 runs, but that number doesn’t define Virat. Even if he never gets there, his impact on the game is undeniable. Players like (Matthew) Hayden and (Adam) Gilchrist changed the way cricket is played, and Virat has done the same in his own way. Now, with a family of two kids, I think he’s realised he’s achieved everything,"" the former cricketer said.What started as the era of ""Sachin! Sachin!"" eventually transformed into the ""Virat! Virat!"" era.",Virat Kohli retires from Test cricket after 14 years. Kohli led India to maiden Test series win in Australia on the 2018-19 tour.

NEW DELHI: Virat Kohli ’s unexpected decision to retire from Test cricket has left the cricketing world stunned, and his former Delhi and Ranji coach Sarandeep Singh is no exception.In a surprising revelation, the ex-India spinner claimed that Kohli had shown no signs of stepping away from the red-ball format and was actively preparing for India’s upcoming tour of England.“Not at all,” Sarandeep said when asked if Kohli hinted at retiring. “He came to play red-ball cricket (in Ranji Trophy), so he had no thinking like that. Even at that time, he was talking about the England series with the test matches that are coming. So, he was going to play there.""And this time, he would be very much prepared. He said he was going to score maximum hundreds, which he did the last time in 2018 when he went to England. He scored a lot of runs over there. There was nothing like that when he came to play Ranji Trophy matches.""We thought that we would see him on the England tour. He is one of the most senior players. Especially, the England tour is very tough. So, without him, I don't know how the Indian team will manage now.”Kohli had rejoined Delhi’s Ranji squad earlier this year for the game against Railways, signalling his intent to get more game time ahead of the tough overseas series.According to Sarandeep, the 36-year-old was eager to score big in England once more, reminiscent of his brilliant 593-run haul during the 2018 tour.Kohli’s retirement came ahead of the crucial five-match Test series against England, which also serves as the opening leg of India’s World Test Championship 2025–27 cycle.With 123 Tests, 9,230 runs, and a captaincy record of 40 wins in 68 matches, Kohli leaves behind an extraordinary legacy.His final series, the 2024–25 Border-Gavaskar Trophy in Australia, was a mixed bag. Despite a century in the opening Test at Perth, his overall returns were modest, and his vulnerability against the moving ball showed.Still, many believed he had one final chapter left in England.

Cricket South Africa (CSA) demands its players, including eight members selected for the World Test Championship final, to return from the Indian Premier League (IPL) 2025 by May 26, ahead of their crucial match at Lord's from June 11. This requirement affects 20 South African players currently participating in the IPL , with ongoing negotiations between CSA and the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI).Proteas men's head coach Shukri Conrad addressed the situation on Tuesday, stating: ""The initial agreement with the IPL and the BCCI was with the final being on the 25th, our players would return on the 26th so that it allows them ample time before we fly out on the 30th. Nothing has changed from our perspective. That is the ongoing conversations that are being had between people in a higher pay grade than I am, i.e. the Director of Cricket (Enoch Nkwe) and Pholetsi Mosek (CSA CEO), so they're dealing with that. But as it stands, we're not budging on that, I don't think.

The race for the IPL 2025 playoffs is quite intense, with fans busy drawing up various permutations and combinations through which their favourite franchise can qualify for the knockouts. RCB will face KKR on May 17th in a match that is certainly vital for the Bangalore-based franchise's playoff aspirations.However, the Rajat Patidar-led side could potentially miss out on the presence of four overseas players, including their top wicket-taker Josh Hazlewood. While Australia will face South Africa in the World Test Championship (WTC) 2025 final which starts from June 11, West Indies is scheduled to tour Ireland and England from May 21st to June 10th.There are also question marks over whether Australian pacer Mitchell Starc would be available for DC's remaining matches, which is definitely a major concern for the franchise considering his ability to emerge as a game-changer.While players had been granted a No Objection Certificate (NOC) with regard to featuring in the IPL till May 25, the revised schedule resulted in clashes with international fixtures. Concerns over the availability of overseas players extend across franchises and could well upset their momentum, considering the efforts involved in figuring out the perfect lineup.Quiz: Who's that IPL player? Without much ado, here's a look at the players who might not feature in the remaining IPL 2025 matches:The Bangalore-based franchise is currently on the second spot in the IPL 2025 points table with 16 points from 11 matches. However, they are closely followed by Punjab Kings (15 points) and Mumbai Indians (14 points), who occupy the third and fourth spot respectively. Jacob Bethell, Romario Shepherd, Lungi Ngidi and Josh Hazlewood are the four overseas players who may be unavailable for RCB. Shepherd and Bethell have been picked for the limited-overs matches between West Indies and England. Ngidi and Hazlewood may not feature due to the upcoming WTC final. Hazlewood is on the third spot in IPL 2025's leading wicket-takers' list, having registered 18 dismissals in 10 matches. His absence will definitely hurt RCB.The Shubman Gill-led side is currently on top of the IPL 2025 points table, with 16 points having recorded four wins in their last five matches. One of the key factors behind this success has been the form of English cricketer Jos Buttler who is among the top run-getters in IPL 2025, with 500 runs in 11 matches. However, Buttler could well be unavailable for the playoffs, considering his selection for England's ODI and T20I series against West Indies. Sherfane Rutherford (West Indies) and Kagiso Rabada (South Africa) are other doubtful overseas names after being picked for their respective nations' fixtures.The Hardik Pandya-led franchise could miss out on the presence of South Africa's Corbin Bosch and Ryan Rickelton as well as England's Will Jacks. While Bosch and Rickleton have been named in South Africa's squad for the WTC final, Jacks is a part of England's squad for their matches against West Indies.: Both the franchises are expected to miss out on the presence of two overseas players each. South Africa's Marco Jansen (PBKS) and Tristan Stubbs (DC), as well as Australia's Josh Inglis (PBKS) and Mitchell Starc (DC) have been picked for the WTC final. Jansen has been an effective performer for PBKS with his left-arm pace and ability to smash the ball down the order while Stubbs is a vital member of the DC batting lineup.However, Starc's unavailability is expected to be the biggest blow, considering his ability to get the job done in the death overs and effectiveness as a wicket-taker. The Australian pacer had single-handedly helped KKR dominate proceedings in the IPL 2024 playoffs and could have done the same for the Delhi-based franchise.DC are currently on the fifth position with 13 points and are set to face GT, MI as well as PBKS in the remaining matches. The absence of Stubbs and Starc could well come back to haunt them, considering the tough fixtures where every single bit would be of great importance. Even PBKS are in a must-win scenario and could definitely miss the presence of a game-changer like Josh Inglis.: Both LSG and KKR have a very slim chance of making it to the playoffs. While the Lucknow-based franchise has accumulated 10 points in 11 matches, the Ajinkya Rahane-led side possesses 11 points from 12 games. While KKR currently face no concerns about the availability of overseas players, the Rishabh Pant-led franchise could miss out on the presence of South Africa's Aiden Markram and West Indies' Shamar Joseph.Markram has been picked in South Africa's squad for the WTC final and could well prove to be a crucial miss, considering his vast experience and quality performances for LSG in IPL 2025. Joseph has been picked for West Indies' limited overs matches against England.All three teams are out of contention for a spot in the playoffs, leaving a lot of flexibility with regard to the availability of overseas players. RR's Jofra Archer as well as CSK's Jamie Overton have been picked for the limited-overs matches between England and West Indies, making their availability an area of concern. However, fixtures involving these franchises are set to get over early, resulting in additional chances of overseas players featuring for their respective franchises.SRH captain Pat Cummins and batter Travis Head are expected to return for the Hyderabad-based franchise's upcoming matches, which will certainly boost the team's aspirations of finishing off strongly."," RCB will face KKR on May 17th in a match that is certainly vital for the Bangalore-based franchise's playoff aspirations.

Speaking on thepodcast, Healy recalled the confusion and panic that unfolded as stadium lights abruptly went out and whispers of a missile attack spread.""It was a surreal experience,” Healy said. “All of a sudden a couple of the light towers went out and we were just sitting there up the top waiting... the next minute the guy who wrangles the group of us came up and his face was white.

Virat Kohli retires from Test cricket after 14 years

Former England all-rounder Moeen Ali has described Virat Kohli 's retirement from Test cricket as a significant setback for the format, while also addressing India's upcoming five-Test series in England starting June 20 at Headingley. Ali particularly emphasized Kohli's role as a pioneer in Test cricket and the impact of both Kohli and Rohit Sharma 's absence on the Indian team.Both Kohli, India's most successful Test captain, and Rohit Sharma announced their retirements earlier this week, creating a leadership vacuum ahead of the crucial series that marks the beginning of the 2025-27 ICC World Test Championship cycle.""It's a massive blow to Test cricket. Virat was the one pioneer, the one guy in Test cricket that always pushed the format,"" Moeen told Sky Sports. ""He's done so much for the game, especially in India. I think after Sachin, he was the guy everybody came to watch. He filled out stadiums.""""He had an amazing record, was a brilliant player to watch — very competitive and a brilliant captain. The style he played with inspired many. It's a big blow not just for India, but for the game.""Moeen, who retired from international cricket in 2023 but continues in T20 franchise cricket, acknowledged that England would benefit from the absence of India's two senior Test batters.""Definitely, I think it's a massive boost for England,"" Moeen said. ""Two top players, who've been to England a few times on tour, so they have the experience. I remember Rohit playing really well the last time. The character they have, the leaders they are — both of them have captained India in Test cricket — so yeah, a massive loss for the team.""Quiz: Who's that IPL player? Rohit's contribution during the 2021 tour was significant, scoring 368 runs including a century at The Oval.Regarding future leadership, Moeen suggested Shubman Gill as the likely candidate to take over the captaincy role.""I think it will be Shubman Gill,"" Moeen said. ""Ideally, they (BCCI) would want Jasprit Bumrah to captain because he is a very good leader who has done it before. But because of his injury record, he might not be able to last the whole series.""While Gill leads Gujarat Titans in the IPL, he hasn't captained India in Tests or ODIs.""They've still got a very, very good captain in Gill , inexperienced yes, but a good captain and a good brain,"" Moeen opined. ""But it will be a challenge. England is a tough place for any touring captain, and when it's your first time as leader, it's even more difficult.""Moeen believes England will start as favorites in the series, given their home advantage and strong Test squad under Ben Stokes and Brendon McCullum.""The signs look good for England to take the series,"" Moeen said, before adding a customary warning: ""But I would never underestimate India or the ability they have, particularly with the bat. They still have brilliant players — they just don't have the experience of playing in England. And that's something you absolutely need.""The five-Test series begins at Headingley on June 20, followed by matches at Lord's (June 28), Trent Bridge (July 6), The Oval (July 14), and Old Trafford (July 24).",Former England all-rounder Moeen Ali has described Virat Kohli's retirement from Test cricket as a significant setback for the format.

""Paulo has a hugely impressive track record working with young players, which is essential when you look at the age profile of our squad"".

A new chapter for Watford under Paulo Pezzolano's leadership

We have confidence in Paulo as a leader as we prepare for the new season,

Watford Football Club has unveiled Paulo Pezzolano as the new head coach in a major restructuring after the sacking of Tom Cleverley . The 42-year-old Uruguayan, who was in charge of Spanish club Real Valladolid, takes over with the hope of re-energising the Hornets' bid for promotion.In March 2024, former Manchester United midfielder Tom Cleverley was appointed interim manager of Watford, and was appointed to the position a month later. Despite hope at the beginning of the season, their team's results deteriorated, and only five wins all year led to a 1–1 draw at the home of Sheffield Wednesday on the last day of the season. It was the downturn that had Cleverley leaving, a decision which frustrated supporters who had applauded his commitment to their club.Pezzolano's tenure at Real Valladolid ended in November 2024 after the club was relegated to the Segunda División, finishing last in La Liga with just 17 points. But, despite the blow, Nani, the Watford sporting director, stated,Paulo Pezzolano made his managerial debut in his country, Uruguay, on 20 March 2012, in Segunda División 3–1 win against JL Racing Club. He then became head coach of Liverpool Montevideo before moving on to coach abroad: Pachuca in Mexico, and later Cruzeiro in Brazil, winning promotion from Serie B with the latter. His wide-ranging experience in South American leagues is considered a big positive as he encounters the demands of the English Championship.Watford’s appointment of Pezzolano is part of a strategy to bring fresh ideas and leadership to the club. The 68-year-old compared Pezzolano to the likes of Slavisa Jokanovic, Javi Gracia, and Xisco Munoz, and said he believes the head coach can also take the club to the ‘next step’ in their quest for Premier League football. “” Nani said.With Pezzolano at the helm, there is an emphasis on unity within the squad, forming a team with competitive ambitions at its core. His strong focus on youth and forward-thinking structure matches the club’s vision moving forward to build a pacey, fit, and youthful squad capable of challenging for promotion.Also Read: Crystal Palace sign midfielder Hughes from Watford",Paulo Pezzolano has been appointed as the new head coach of Watford.

Dan Ashworth’s short and expensive spell at Manchester United

“an error on our part,”

Dan Ashworth returning to the FA with a wider role

Dan Ashworth is to return to football after just five months at Manchester United . He is soon going to be appointed to a senior job with the Football Association (FA) as head of elite men’s and women’s development . This will be his first formal position since his expensive and brief stint at Old Trafford was over in December 2024.Dan Ashworth signed up for Manchester United in the middle of 2024 after the club negotiated with Siden, who was working with Newcastle United, where he was the sporting director. The negotiations took time, and the price of the hiring was not cheap. Manchester United reportedly paid between £2m and £3m to get Ashworth, and his total hiring and exit package is believed to have cost the club around £4.1m.Despite being involved in a transfer window where Manchester United spent nearly £200m, Ashworth left by mutual agreement after just 159 days. Club co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe later admitted in an interview that hiring Ashworth had beenand said that the decision was affected by a lack of chemistry.After leaving United, Ashworth did not take on another football job. However, he continued his free advisory job with Warwickshire County Cricket Club, which he had started in 2021.This is a new role for Ashworth for FA, who had previously worked for the organisation from 2012 to 2018. The U17 and U20 sides also won the World Cup for England in 2017, while the Under-19 team won the European title.In his new job, Ashworth will oversee the development of both men's and women’s teams at junior and senior levels. A big part of his job will also involve supporting the growth of homegrown coaching talent , as only two current Premier League managers are English.He is also expected to help lead the next stage of upgrades at St George’s Park , the national football centre. While the FA has not made an official comment, reports say Ashworth will work closely with current technical directors while taking charge of several key areas.Also Read: 2025 UEFA Europa League Final: When, how and where to watch Tottenham vs Man Utd clash","Dan Ashworth will return to the FA as head of elite men's and women's development.

Jofre Torrents' journey through adversity and rise to prominence

FC Barcelona’s commitment and prospects

Torrents' role in the next generation of La Masia graduates

Jofre Torrents has signed with FC Barcelona until 2028. The 18-year-old left-back , who has proved himself at La Masia , has impressed the Barcelona coaching staff . Pocketing a new contract not only indicates the club’s faith in the kid but also a tactic to prevent any overtures from other European giants.Jofre Torrents was born on January 28, 2007, in La Selva del Camp, Spain, and he joined Barcelona's youth academy in 2018. He suffered a cruciate ligament tear during an international match in September 2023 and was out for the whole season. In a display of resilience, Torrents impressively bounced back in the 2024–25 season, being promoted to the U19s and appearing for FC Barcelona Atletic in March 2025.The way he plays, his runs into the box, the crosses, pinned one-on-one, are strong. Although he suffered a hamstring injury in early 2025, which was another setback, Torrents recovered his form and once again displayed his never-say-die on-field talents.Barcelona's gesture to tie Torrents to the club until 2028 suggests they see a future first-team player in him. The actions of the club's hierarchy and staff, among them President Joan Laporta and Sporting Director Deco, were crucial in achieving this agreement, at a time when clubs, including Liverpool, Borussia Dortmund, and AS Roma had expressed interest in poaching the young forward.The fact that Torrents is training with the senior side under coach Hansi Flick is further evidence of their intentions. Impressing at the highest level will not come immediately; the path to regular participation with the first team is blocked, but he's there or thereabouts.Jofre Torrents began a revolution and a boom generation of La Masia talent that FC Barcelona continues to use in their long-term planning and strategic direction. With youth development more of a priority for the club at the moment, so they can rebuild sustainably and carry on their footballing philosophy, Torrents is something of a poster boy for this approach. His hard work, maturity, as well as his technical ability, have been commended by coaches and fellow players, with many at the club feeling as though he may have what it takes to occupy a place in the first team’s backline in coming seasons.Also Read: Barcelona vs Real Madrid La Liga Highlights: FC Barcelona beat Real Madrid 4-3 in high-stakes El Clasico",Jofre Torrents has signed a new contract with FC Barcelona until 2028.

Jules Kounde clarifies his position on social media

“Another lie… I wasn’t anywhere close to this place. This is not journalism. Do better.”

Focus returns to football and Barcelona’s goals

Barcelona defender Jules Kounde has denied he went to an afterparty thrown by American rapper Travis Scott after the club’s 3-0 win against Real Madrid in El Clásico. The win, in La Liga , represented a huge lift for Barca’s season, but thoughts on the day were momentarily diverted from football to rumors concerning the team’s celebrations, especially an alleged event that was attended by personalities and celebrities.The rumours have been fuelled by Travis Scott’s presence in Barcelona and sponsor Spotify, Barcelona’s principal shirt sponsor. Barcelona played in a limited-edition jersey that included the “Cactus Jack” logo — the symbol for Scott’s label — leading to even further speculation that the rapper’s visit involved private after-parties with some of the players.Following this, because of all the talk, Jules Kounde took to his X post to respond, writing:His statement followed multiple reports that he was spotted at an exclusive party in Sant Adria de Besos – a municipality in Barcelona – where Scott is believed to have put on a more exclusive performance.Kounde’s quick response is likely intended to stifle any narratives that would speculate his professionalism towards the club; he’s not the type of player to refuse to be part of a team. While the party was also supposedly attended by former Barcelona legends Ronaldinho, Gerard Pique, and Carles Puyol, Kounde insisted he was not involved in the celebrations.It’s not the first time players have had to navigate the sensationalized rumors of nightlife or night-after-news nightclub celebrations in the limelight. With Kounde, it feels important to deliver a message of concentration and dedication, especially with the season in its crucial last few weeks.Barcelona are scrapping for a Champions League place and need to end the season as best as they can; they will require high-flying players such as Kounde to focus on them entirely. The French international, who has made 17 appearances in the league this season for the club, having arrived from Sevilla, has been a first-team regular at the back and remains a key man under head coach Xavi Hernandez.Situation aside, Kounde's response is a no-nonsense stance that fans and management grow tired of. And with important games coming thick and fast, the Frenchman has his mind firmly set on one thing: playing well and helping to achieve Barcelona's goals.Also Read: Hansi Flick set to sign new Barcelona deal until 2027 after La Liga title win","Barcelona defender Jules Kounde has denied he went to an afterparty thrown by American rapper Travis Scott after the club’s 3-0 win against Real Madrid in El Clásico.

Everton Women make history with permanent move to Goodison Park,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/news/everton-women-make-history-with-permanent-move-to-goodison-park/articleshow/121144843.cms,"Image via evertonwomen/Instagram

Why Goodison Park is the perfect home for Everton Women

“The move addresses Everton Women's rapid growth and need for a larger, more suitable venue than Walton Hall Park,”

How Everton Women team would get benefitted?

“This move is a testament to where the women's game is right now and, more importantly, where it is heading,”

“Goodison is a magical stadium with a deep heritage and close ties to the local community. Leading the team out for that first home match of next season will be nothing short of a career highlight — and the prospect of what Everton Women can become with such an iconic ground to call our home is hugely exciting.”

In a big step forward for the women's game on Merseyside, Everton have confirmed that their women’s team will move to Goodison Park permanently beginning next season. The timing lines up with the men’s team preparing to leave the stadium after 133 years, as they get ready to move into the new Everton Stadium . For the women’s side, the switch from Walton Hall Park to one of English football’s most iconic grounds is more than just a change of venue — it’s a sign of how much the women’s game has grown.Goodison Park has been at the heart of Everton’s history for well over a century. Now, with the men’s side set to play their final match there this Sunday against Southampton, the torch is being passed to the women’s team.Until now, Everton Women have played their home games at Walton Hall Park, a modest 2,200-seater that served its purpose but was clearly starting to feel a bit tight for a team on the rise. This season, they got a taste of Goodison twice — a solid win over rivals Liverpool and a tough 5–0 loss to Chelsea. Still, those appearances gave fans and players a glimpse of what the future could look like.the club said in a statement.It’s not just about more seats or a bigger stage. The club plans to gradually upgrade the stadium to make sure the facilities match the moment. They’re also banking on the move bringing a boost to local businesses, with more fans expected to turn out and spend money around matchdays.Everton Women finished eighth in the WSL this season, but with this kind of backing and visibility, the hope is that they can start pushing further up the table. Captain Megan Finnigan, who’s been with the team through its ups and downs, couldn’t hide her excitement.she said.The switch to Goodison isn’t just a new address for Everton Women — it’s a signal of intent. It shows the club sees a future where the women’s team is front and center, playing in a stadium that means something to fans across generations. And while the men’s team moves on to a shiny new home, Goodison Park will keep its soul alive with a fresh chapter — one led by the next generation of Everton talent. Along with the women's fixtures, the stadium will also host academy matches, keeping it a living, breathing part of the club’s future.Also Read: Real Madrid consider Dean Huijsen for centre-back role amid Premier League interest",Everton have confirmed that their women's team will move to Goodison Park permanently next season.

Jeremie Frimpong to play LB at Liverpool

What Jeremie Frimpong brings to Liverpool football club?

Reports suggest that Liverpool football club is close to finalising a deal for Bayer Leverkusen defender Jeremie Frimpong . The club has identified him as a key replacement for Trent Alexander-Arnold, who will leave at the end of the season. Talks between Liverpool and Frimpong’s camp have progressed well. Reports suggest a five-year contract is nearly ready. The Dutch right-back has a €40 million release clause, which makes the deal easier for Liverpool. If completed, this would be Arne Slot ’s first major signing of the summer as he prepares for life without Alexander-Arnold at the LB position.Trent Alexander-Arnold is set to end his long association with Liverpool. The England international is expected to join Real Madrid after his contract expires this summer. Liverpool has been planning for his departure and identified Frimpong as their top choice. The 24-year-old player has a €40 million buy-out in his Leverkusen contract, which has made it easier for the transfer to be concluded.Frimpong has performed extremely well under ex-manager and Real Madrid legend Xabi Alonso. He contributed to an unbeaten Bundesliga season and a German Cup success in Leverkusen. He scored 5 goals and had 12 assists in all competitions in the 2023-24 campaign. Liverpool’s new manager, Arne Slot, seems open to revolve his defence around Frimpong. Reports indicate that both parties are close to an agreement. It is expected that once the transfer window opens in June, the deal will become official.Jeremie Frimpong is an energetic player. He plays from the right-hand side and regularly outpaces defenders to get goals. He launched his career at Manchester City, and later he joined Celtic that same year before returning to Leverkusen in 2021. In Leverkusen, he flourished under a system of 3-4-2-1, which allowed him the room to move forward. Made a total of 26 goal contributions last season, improving the attacking qualities of a defender that he is.Liverpool will most likely use him in a similar position to Alexander-Arnold. Although Frimpong is not the perfect replacement with regards to style of play, his energy and forward runs make him a good choice. Slot might have to readjust the shape of the team a little bit in order to get the best out of Frimpong. However, with Mohamed Salah in front of him on the right, both could make a great partnership.Jeremie Frimpong’s arrival would be Liverpool’s second headline signing under Arne Slot.

Real Madrid consider Dean Huijsen for centre back role amid Premier League interest,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/news/real-madrid-consider-dean-huijsen-for-centre-back-role-amid-premier-league-interest/articleshow/121143487.cms,"Image Source: Getty

Xabi Alonso's defensive reinforcement plan includes Premier League talent

Premier League clubs battle for signatures as the Club World Cup looms

Real Madrid Club de Fútbol have settled on AFC Bournemouth defender Dean Huijsen as their prime target to bolster their defensive line before the FIFA Club World Cup in a month. The 20-year-old Spanish centre back who joined Toulouse from Juventus Football Club last July for £12.8 million has seen interest from various Premier League giants such as the Chelsea Football Club , Arsenal Football Club and the Liverpool Football Club.Incoming Real Madrid manager Xabi Alonso, who is in line to succeed Carlo Ancelotti in a matter of several weeks, has put defensive reinforcements on top of his agenda with a shortlist of top players. Though William Saliba of Arsenal Football Club is still a “dream target” for Los Blancos, the French international is believed to be too costly as Arsenal is on the verge of giving him a new deal.Madrid has also shown interest in Liverpool Football Club’s Ibrahima Konaté, whose contract will also expire in June 2026, with negotiations reportedly stalling. However, the Spanish nationality of Huijsen and his preexisting relationship with Real Madrid, who tried to sign him before his signing with Juventus in 2021, can give the youngster an advantage in the transfer race.Deam Huijsen reportedly has a £50 million release clause in his current contract with AFC Bournemouth, which is said to be payable in three instalments – a discovery that has fast-tracked Real Madrid's pursuit of the rising defender.Chelsea football club had been early favourites to sign up Huijsen, but are now considering alternatives such as Jorrel Hato from Ajax and former Chelsea defender Marc Guehi, with Real Madrid going for the jugular.According to the reports in the Spanish media, Dean Huijsen has made it clear through his father that the Santiago Bernabéu is still his destination of choice, even if he has to settle for a less lucrative financial package than what the Premier League clubs can provide.Real Madrid will face their first opponents in the summer’s FIFA Club World Cup on June 18 when they play against Al-Hilal, and the summer transfer window will be open for a few days, from June 1 to June 10, exclusively for the registration of squads for the tournament.Also Read: Hansi Flick set to sign new Barcelona deal until 2027 after La Liga title win",Xabi Alonso's defensive reinforcement plan includes Premier League talent.

All about the Tokyo E-Prix

The Tokyo E-Prix is just around the corner, and it presents yet another opportunity to boost the participation of women in motorsport . Formula E has implemented the FIA Girls on Track program, which aims to raise the percentage of female involvement by inviting young women aged 12 to 18 to explore, free of charge, various facets of motorsport and its industry through a series of activities, workshops, and behind-the-scenes access. Currently, only 1.5 percent of all license holders globally are women.FIA Girls on Track will welcome up to 120 young women during the Tokyo E-Prix race week. The participants will engage in workshops, gaming sessions, career talks, and a Pit Lane walk throughout the event, fostering empowerment and education in motorsport and engineering. The program maintains its emphasis on STEM education and gender inclusivity in motorsport, actively reaching out to girls from diverse backgrounds in each host city.In addition to on-site programming, off-site activities will include an immersive E-Karting masterclass, also open to up to 120 young women. This initiative is designed to offer hands-on experience and exposure to E-Karting, aligning with Formula E’s broader social impact mission of involving and engaging local communities at every race location.Japanese-American racing driver and content creator Hana Burton, along with active rally driver Maaya Orido—who competes in the XCR Sprint Cup Hokkaido and Rally Hokkaido—will also be present at the event. The FIA Girls on Track program is proudly supported by Hankook (Presenting Partner), ABB (Principal Partner), and Fortescue Zero (Official Partner).This marks the second season of the Tokyo E-Prix, following its debut last year.

Reflecting on his experience, he said, “It was a mega, a proper Formula E track. Bumps, fast corners, on the limit and you’ve really got to attack in qualifying. I thought the track was fantastic.”Set in the heart of Tokyo Bay , the 2.575km circuit features 18 turns and boasts a compact, technical layout that includes three long straights and three chicane sequences.

BENGALURU: Amid rising concerns over Karnataka State Cricket Association’s (KSCA) administrative stability in the aftermath of Wednesday’s stampede at M Chinnaswamy Stadium, hosting of cricket in the city has taken a huge hit. The first casualty is the three-match one-day series between India ‘A’ and South Africa ‘A’ scheduled to be held here from Nov 13 to 19.Without specifying any reason, Indian cricket board ( BCCI ) issued a press release, stating Bengaluru matches have been shifted to Rajkot. The KSCA president did not dwell on the reasons but maintained that the stampede and change of venues were not related. Sources said the decision was taken on Thursday and communicated to KSCA.Before the limited-overs series, the two teams will play two multi-day red-ball matches and those will be held as per schedule at BCCI’s Centre of Excellence (CoE) — a dedicated centre near the airport on the outskirts of the city.This could probably be the beginning of problems for KSCA as a host association. According to sources, BCCI and the International Cricket Council (ICC) are now weighing the feasibility of ICC Women’s WC matches that are to be held in Bengaluru between Sept and Nov.Chinnaswamy Stadium is one of the five venues in India set to host the premier tournament with the Bengaluru facility earmarked for the opening contest involving India (on Sept 30), one semifinal (Oct 30) and the final (Nov 2) if Pakistan does not qualify, in which case it will be moved to Colombo.Speaking to TOI, former India captain Shantha Rangaswamy said, “I’m yet to come to terms with the tragedy at the stadium, which has brought joy and happiness to fans for 50 years. If the women’s World Cup matches are shifted out of Bengaluru, it will be a huge blow to cricket in the state. As for women’s cricket, we haven’t seen much growth in the past two-and-a-half years, and it will set us back further.”According to sources, it is unlikely KSCA will host a major cricket match for some time. To begin with, the stadium needs to be renovated, with the fan frenzy on Wednesday resulting in significant damage to the structure, including compound walls, railings, the staircase, and sanitation.","M Chinnaswamy Stadium is one of the five venues in India set to host the premier tournament.

NEW DELHI: South Africa head coach Shukri Conrad revealed that his team spent an ""enlightening"" evening with England pace legend Stuart Broad ahead of their World Test Championship final against Australia at Lord's. Broad, who retired from international cricket two years ago, finished with 604 wickets in 167 Tests, many of them against the Aussies.The 38-year-old joined the South African team for dinner on Sunday to share insights ahead of their title clash against the defending champions starting Wednesday.""It was just a casual chat but if the guys hadn't called time at 10:30 pm (2130 GMT) we'd still be there chatting,"" Conrad said at a media interaction at Lord's on Monday.""Everybody walked away thinking that was great.""Conrad also spoke about former South Africa captain Graeme Smith 's visit to Sunday’s training session.""He's a legend in South African cricket, the most successful Test captain we have had,"" he said. ""He's not going to impose himself but if anyone wants to have a chat he's there for that.""He clarified that these meetings were informal rather than structured advisory roles.""It's just using whatever we can,"" he said.""If it adds value, great.""Responding to critics who suggested South Africa had a soft path to the final by avoiding Australia and England during the WTC cycle, Conrad was firm in his response.""I'm tired of speaking about it. We're here and we've got a chance to walk away as world Test champions,"" he said.""Playing Australia, it doesn't get any bigger than that. What's gone before counts for absolutely nothing at the minute. We're quietly confident going into this game that we can pull one over them.""We still hold Test cricket very dearly. Our fixture list might not speak to that, but this is the biggest final all of our players have ever been involved in and their biggest match.""Heading into the final, South Africa’s relatively inexperienced batting line-up has come under scrutiny.""The inexperience is very apparent in terms of the number of Tests played and their place in the ICC rankings,"" Conrad admitted.""So, I think it's pretty normal that the chat is all about the bowlers when you've got guys like Kagiso Rabada , ranked two in the world, and Marco (Jansen) and (spinner) Keshav (Maharaj).""""But I think there's a quiet confidence among the batting group.

Poll Can South Africa win the ICC Test Championship title against Australia? Yes, they have the momentum. No, Australia will prevail.





NEW DELHI: Keshav Maharaj is determined to follow in the famous footsteps of Graeme Smith and his world number one team of yesteryears at the World Test Championship final, beginning on Wednesday. South Africa will face-off against Australia for ownership of the ICC Test Championship mace at the Lord's, the same venue where the Proteas last got their hands on the trophy 13 years ago.A legendary South Africa side comprising Jacques Kallis, Dale Steyn and Graeme Smith beat England at the fabled ground to rise to world number one that day, and Maharaj revealed those memories are fuelling motivation for his side to repeat the feat.""I remember watching that when they lifted the mace,"" he said.""We know that apart from doing it for us, we want to honour the legends of the past and hopefully we will one day be seen in the same calibre and light to win such a coveted title and hold the Test mace.""South Africa arrive in London in strong form following seven consecutive Test victories, with last defeat coming against New Zealand in February 2024.That run took the Proteas to the top of the ICC World Test Championship table and has bred plenty of confidence in camp ahead of the decider against Australia.""When we started the journey two years ago, a lot of people didn’t think we’d be in this situation, but with each and every series we grew more and more,"" added Maharaj.""Our blend of youth and experience complements each other really nicely, and we find ourselves competing for another trophy. The boys have put in a lot of hard work. The excitement is building as we edge closer and it’s now about letting it sink in and soaking up the occasion to allow us to play with freedom.”Maharaj is one of a number in the South African squad who have come agonisingly close to ICC silverware in the past few years.The spinner was part of the side that finished runners-up at the T20 World Cup 2024, while the Proteas also reached the semi-finals of both the ODI World Cup 2023 and Champions Trophy 2025.While those near misses still sting, Maharaj is insistent on using those experiences in a positive way.“In previous attempts, no one expected us to reach the knockout phases of any competition, but we have reached two semi-finals and two finals.“Hopefully through all those misses we come right in this one. There is a lot of inspiration we can draw from in the brand of cricket we have played in the last three or four years.“If we run with it and stay true to it, hopefully this is our opportunity to finally raise that most-coveted trophy that has eluded us for a number of years,” he said.On a personal note, Maharaj is just two away from 200 Test wickets, and while the experienced spinner is happy to trade individual accolades for team success, the prospect of bringing up the milestone at Lord’s is one that he cannot escape.“I don’t pay too much attention to the numbers, I just want to help ensure my team wins, so hopefully I can get a 10-fer.“I’ve enjoyed my journey so far, hopefully I’ve got a long time left, but to get that feat in front of my family at Lord’s would be very special,"" added Maharaj.","South Africa take on Australia in the World Test Championship final. The final will be held at Lord's, the same venue where the Proteas won the trophy 13 years ago.

So, who can Spurs bring in as Ange Postecoglou's replacement?

Poll Do you think Ange Postecoglou deserved the sack despite winning the Europa League title? It's a mistake, he should have stayed. It was the right decision, time for a change.

Ange Postecoglou, despite his heroics in the UEFA Europa League, leading Tottenham Hotspur to the trophy over rivals Manchester United, has been relieved of his duties. The Australian manager took charge of the club in 2023 and helped them end a 17-year wait for silverware with the win in the Europa League. However, it was not enough to keep him at the club as the club announced its decision to sack their manager.As Postecoglou leaves upon fulfilling a promise - that he usually wins things in his second season - there is discussion on who the club should hire as his replacement. Among his potential replacements is a familiar name in Mauricio Pochettino. The Argentine was in charge of the club from 2014 to 2019, during which he led them to a Champions League final in 2019. Amidst rumors of a return to his former club, the current United States Men's National Team head coach said that a return at this point in time is unrealistic.""Today it's not realistic,"" said Pochettino, 53. ""Look where I am. Look where we (his backroom staff) are. The answer is so clear,"" said the 53-year-old. His current responsibilities and the fact that the USA is preparing to host the 2026 FIFA World Cup alongside Mexico and Canada further rules out a surprise return.Thomas Frank : The Brentford head coach is the frontrunner to join Spurs as their new manager.

Legendary French forward and former Bayern Munich star Franck Ribery took shots at Portuguese skipper Cristiano Ronaldo as the latter made a comment on who he thinks should win the 2025 Ballon d'Or. In a press conference ahead of the UEFA Nations League final, Ronaldo expressed his opinion that the individual honour should be handed to a player whose team participated in the UEFA Champions League final.Ronaldo's comments were in response to a question that sought to elicit the veteran's take on who should win the Ballon d'Or between FC Barcelona's Lamine Yamal and Paris Saint-Germain's Ousmane Dembele. Another frontrunner for the award is Barcelona forward Raphinha, who also leads the tally in goal contributions across Europe's top five leagues.However, Ronaldo's comment was enough to provoke Ribery into a heated reaction, as the Frenchman took to Instagram. ""So you NEED to win the Champions League to win the Ballon d'Or?"", wrote the 42-year-old on his Instagram story.His reaction alludes to the fact that he missed out on the same award despite being part of a Bayern Munich squad that won the treble. In the title-winning campaign, Ribery led the charge alongside Arjen Robben and Mario Mandzukic. Despite a brilliant season, Ribery saw Ronaldo lift the Ballon d'Or after voting for the same was extended.This helped the Portuguese attract more votes owing to his hat-trick against Sweden as his team qualified for the 2014 FIFA World Cup.However, Ronaldo's comment is in contradiction to his own Ballon d'Or triumph, where his side fell in the Champions League 3-4 on aggregate to Borussia Dortmund. Ronaldo's five Ballon d'Or wins are second only to rival Lionel Messi, who has lifted 8 till date.After suggesting that Lamine Yamal should not win the Ballon d'Or, Ronaldo will take him on in the final of the UEFA Nations League as Spain face Portugal at the Allianz Arena in Germany.",Franck Ribery took to Instagram to respond to Cristiano Ronaldo's Ballon d'Or comments.

TAG Heuer Porsche gained big in Shanghai





TAG Heuer Porsche driver Pascal Wehrlein gained no points on Day 1 of the Shanghai E-Prix last weekend. However, the Formula E driver was able to turn the tables in a rainy race the next day and claim second place on the podium. After the race, he confirmed that the result made him realise they were actually competitive on a wet track.Pascal Wehrlein secured second place in the Round 11 race in Shanghai, with his teammate Antonio Felix Da Costa joining him on the podium in third. The two had started in the same positions on the grid but in reverse order. It was, nevertheless, a double gain for Porsche on Sunday.Talking about the Round 11 race, Wehrlein said, “Very tricky conditions especially in the beginning, I think it got a little bit better towards the end, but our pace was good. Not good enough for P1, but quite far ahead of the guys behind. Personally I’m very happy about the result today because today was the first time that I felt like we were very competitive in the wet, which wasn’t the case in Tokyo and Monaco. I think we’ve found a good way there and in the end a happy ending for us. ”The two also scored double podiums at the Mexico E-Prix and then again in Miami, where Wehrlein won. He earned another podium at the Tokyo E-Prix.With such a strong performance this year, Wehrlein currently holds second place in the Formula E Driver Standings with 103 points.“It was a very strong result today in very tricky and challenging wet conditions,” Porsche Formula E boss Florian Modlinger stated after the double podium in Round 11. The 34 points earned from the results, plus the fastest lap by Wehrlein, also promoted Porsche to the top of the Teams’ World Championship—by a single point ahead of Nissan.“We are really happy with these points and regaining the lead in the Teams’ Championship by a single point. It will be a very hard fight to the end of the year.

We'd like to address those comments that he made I believe on the team radio. Number one, thank you for the free publicity. We'll take that any day of the week.

: Carlos Alcaraz fell on his back where he lay, looking up at Paris’ early evening sky. He had taken all of five-hours and 29-minutes to defend his French Open title, collecting his second Coupe des Mousquetaires trophy.The Spaniard – a whole new vibe for the sport, muscular frame and expressive play - battled back from the brink, saving three match points in the fourth set, then overcame a wobble in the fifth to claim his fifth Major title, he remained unbeaten in Major finals. The world No.2 scored a 4-6, 6-7 (4), 6-4, 7-6 (3), 7-6 (10-2) win over No.1 Jannik Sinner.The first Grand Slam men’s championship match between two players born in 2000s – 21 months apart, and polar opposites in play and personality, the ice and spice of the sport – was one for the ages.It was to those notes that the French Open final teed off too on a cold, windy afternoon, with the first game of the match lasting all of 12 minutes. Sinner warded off three breakpoints in the game as the afternoon was poised to stretch into a long evening.Alcaraz, who appeared to have some trouble with his eyes in the first set, perhaps some specks of clay had got in the way, had the trainer attend to it. When play resumed Sinner closed out the set.Sinner, who looked more settled in the second set, opened up his arms, striking the ball freely, took a 3-0 lead. The Spaniard, who was entertaining the crowd with his tennis, even overruled a call on Sinner’s serve, giving the Italian the point.In the tie-break, Sinner jumped ahead 6-2, but the crowd, near 15,000 and almost all of it for the Spaniard, egged Alcaraz, who responded with the brilliance only he is capable of crafting, mixing powerful play with caressing drop shots, to narrow the lead, but Sinner dug deep.The Italian struck right back. While the 23-year-old Italian doesn’t give much away by way of expression, the glances he throws at his box, at the end of virtually every point is hard to miss. Where his team is seated, is his lighthouse. It is where he turns for support and direction.In the third set, Sinner broke in the opening game, but Alcaraz won the next four to take a 4-1 lead much to the delight of the full house, who screamed themselves hoarse with calls of, come on Carlos, erupting in a wildfire of cheer.","Carlos Alcaraz beat Jannik Sinner 4-6, 6-7 (4), 6-4, 7-6 (3), 7- 6 (10-2) in the French Open final at Roland Garros.

Gauff disagrees

World No.1 Aryna Sabalenka, devastated at losing the French Open final, refused to give credit to the champion Coco Gauff in her post-match press conference, looking at it as a final she lost rather than one the world No.2 won. The champion, unsurprisingly, disagreed.: Today sometimes it felt like she was hitting the ball from the frame. Somehow magically the ball lands in the court and (you) are on the backfoot. It felt like a joke, somebody above was laughing, like, ‘Let’s see if you can handle this.’: If Iga (Swiatek) would win (over) me the other day, she would go out today and get the win.: I was making unforced errors. I think she won the match not because she played incredible, (but) just because I made all of those mistakes from easy balls.: I already have a flight booked to Mykonos and alcohol, sugar. I’m just trying to be very polite now, but there is no other word that could describe what just happened today on the court. Tequila, gummy bears, and I don’t know, swimming, being like the tourist for a couple of days.: I don’t agree with that… Last time I played - no shade to Iga or anything - I won in straight sets. I don’t think that’s a fair thing to say. The way Aryna was playing the last few weeks, she was the favourite to win. I think she was the best person that I could have played in the final. I got the hardest matchup if you go on stats alone. Obviously, Iga being a champion here, it was going to be a tough match either way. But, yeah, I think regardless of who I played, I had a good shot to win, and I definitely had that belief. You know how it played out.","Aryna Sabalenka lost in straight sets to Coco Gauff in the French Open final. The world No.1 refused to give credit to the champion in her post-match press conference.

: Coco Gauff scripted a gritty comeback win over the world No.1 Aryna Sabalenka in the French Open final. The American won hearts and applause as she neutralized challenging conditions with her athleticism and monk-like calm, but did the 21-year-old take a page off pop culture and actually manifest her win on Saturday evening?After the two-hour 38-minute final Gauff pulled out a sheet of paper, carrying the words, I will win French Open 2025. The handwritten sentence was repeated eight times on the sheet.The American was on TikTok on the eve of the final when an old interview of Gabrielle Thomas, the Olympic 200m champion, cropped up on her page. The American sprinter had written multiple times that she was going to get gold in the Paris Olympics.“I was like, why is this video of her being interviewed from the Olympics coming up on my page (now)?” Gauff said, adding, “Gabby says she wrote it either 50 or 500 times, I can’t remember. She wrote, ‘I will be the Olympic champion.’ I was like, ‘I have this hotel (pad) and I’m going to write it as many times as I can fit on the (page), and I’m done.’”“After that I looked myself in the mirror and told myself that I had the belief. Then obviously it happened,” she said of her win. “I didn’t know if it was going to work or not, but it did. It’s a great mindset that she (Gabrielle Thomas) had. I was on the mirror writing, trying to hurry up and write because I was ready to go to sleep.But did I win because of that, I don’t know, but I’m going to say, I did.”Gauff, who took charge of the final, where she faced Sabalenka, the heaviest ball striker in the game, displaying a maturity beyond her years. The American has practice, having done much the same thing with her career.A couple of years ago she asked her father Corey, who was managing and coaching her, to step back. She wanted the driver’s seat. It’s not a common thing in sport, where parents, who give up livelihoods for their children’s careers, often refuse to let go when the athlete might benefit in a professional environment.“(When) I asked my dad to take a step back, it ended up being a great thing for both of us,” Gauff said, adding that she asked her mother Candi, a former athlete, to travel with her. “I needed her to be on the road more, (travelling) with a team full of men, I needed some estrogen, some female energy here. Women just notice more things.”“When you’re younger you don’t know how to distinguish your feelings, what you want to do and when’s the right time to say it and things like that,” Gauff explained, “As I got older, I felt I learned a lot about myself. I know myself now, maybe not 100 percent, but I know a little bit more about the things I like and don’t like. That my parents support those decisions mean a lot.”The world No.2, who now has two Major titles from three finals, said her parents trust her.“I’m a dynamite personality so they know if I really (say) something, I mean it,” she said of her decision to take charge of her tennis. “I know myself and know what I need, maybe not in the moment, but after trial and error you start to learn things about yourself. I’m glad that I don’t have pressure (from my) parents. They genuinely want to see me happy and obviously the on-court stuff is great, but their biggest goal for me in life is just to live a happy quality of life. ”","Coco Gauff beat Aryna Sabalenka 6-4, 7-5 in the French Open final.

Alcaraz vs Sinner or Federer vs Nadal?





: Coming into the French Open final, the one question that had not been answered in the bubbling rivalry between Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner was how would they hold up with a major title on the line. They had showcased their class progressionally in the Round of 16, the quarters and the semi-finals.On Sunday, they took that up multifold with a five-hour 29-minute classic that became the longest Roland Garros final in the Open Era. A running forehand down the line winner later, it was Alcaraz who kept his flawless record in major finals alive.The Spaniard came from two sets down to win 4-6, 6-7, 6-4, 7-6, 7-6 to stage a comeback for the history books. In what transpired as the second-longest Grand Slam final since 1968, when the Open Era began, Alcaraz saved three championship points while serving at 3-5 (0-40) in the fourth set.In the decider, Alcaraz led 5-3, got broken, and needed a super tie-break to become only the third man this century - after Gustavo Kuerten and Rafael Nadal - to defend the French Open title. He also became just the third man in the Open Era - after Gaston Gaudio and Novak Djokovic - to save a championship point enroute to a Grand Slam title.The match of extremely small, razor thin margins had Sinner win 193 of the 385 total points while Alcaraz, who won his fifth Grand Slam title, had one less.""This was the most exciting match that I've played so far without a doubt,"" said Alcaraz. ""I think the match had everything.""""Today was all about believing in myself. Never doubted myself today and I tried to go for it,"" he said. ""Real champions are made in those situations,"" he added.After two hours and 12 minutes, Sinner led the match by two sets and the points breakdown by nine (82-73).As the match progressed, ticking past the four-hour mark, another powerful stat emerged. Sinner had never won a match that went past four hours (0-5). At the other end, Alcaraz had never won after losing the first two sets (0-8). One of the two were primed to end that drought with blows from the back getting fiercer and touches at the net getting silkier.You could not put this past Alcaraz who has had bad starts in major finals before only to win the tournament anyway. He trailed Novak Djokovic in the 2023 Wimbledon final and Alexander Zverev here last year.And that streak continued in Paris on Sunday as the 22-year-old banked on the crowd and his typical never-say-die attitude to reel off four straight games in the third set to relegate Sinner to his first set dropped in the tournament.Then, again, standing a point away from defeat, Alcaraz polished off five straight points to hold serve at 3-5 in the fourth set. He then broke Sinner's serve with the Italian attempting to clinch his third straight major title.The crowd vehemently supported Alcaraz as he bagged the tiebreak in the fourth set and forced a decisive fifth set. The Spaniard's racket, masquerading as a magic wand, started to produce astounding drop shots from deep with cross-court forehands landing in with plenty of zip and accuracy.In a match of unending twists, it was Sinner's turn to add some drama to the mix with Alcaraz broken at 5-4 when serving for the title. The World No. 1 picked three games in a row to overturn a 3-5 deficit into a 6-5 lead.In the 10-point tiebreak that followed, Alcaraz showed the three C's that have been passed on from his grandfather - cabeza (head), corazon (heart) and cojones (balls). He didn't shy away from referring to all three in the aftermath.""To put it to words was just happened is really difficult honestly. Two sets down against the World No. 1, with the level that he was playing. I just put my heart into it and tried to keep it going. Never gave up. I was just fighting. Point after point. In the end it was all heart,"" he said on Eurosport.""I played with my grandfather's three Cs. My grandfather is proud. After the match I played, I think I can say that (cojones),"" he added.Two weeks ago, it was Nadal who was feted on Court Philippe-Chatrier. For his 14 titles here and a jaw-dropping 112-4 win-loss record. Alcaraz was one of the thousands in attendance then, beaming, all smiles as his idol was celebrated.In a full circle moment, a fortnight later it was another Spaniard who was celebrated and feted for a trophy run. It was Alcaraz who stood atop the podium with the Coupe des Mousquetaires in tow.His trophy count in Paris may only read two, dwarfed by Nadal's superhuman tally, but the signs of a legend are there. At 22 years, 1 month and 3 days, Alcaraz has won his fifth Grand Slam title - the EXACT same age as Nadal when he achieved the same feat.There have been only 12 matches in this Alcaraz vs Sinner rivalry with the Spaniard leading by 8-4 having polished off the last five matches. The duel between them is eerily similar to that of Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal's historic tussles.Federer, who had a positive head-to-head record against much of the tour during his prime, only struggled to fend off Nadal with their rivalry finishing off at 24-16 in favour of the Spaniard.Sinner can relate with that stat. Since 2024, his win-loss record stands at 91-8. Remove Alcaraz out of that equation and it gets refreshed to 91-3. The last time the 23-year-old had a win over Alcaraz was back in September 2023.Even if the rivalry looks skewed on paper, on court, where it all matters, the margins, like on Sunday, is just a point. And we're here for it - and Carlos agrees.""This is the first match in a Grand Slam final. Hopefully not the last time,"" said Alcaraz.""Because I mean, as I said many times, every time that we face against each other, we raise our level to the top.""","Carlos Alcaraz beats Italy's Jannik Sinner in five-hour 29-minute French Open final. Spaniard came from two sets down to win 4-6, 6-7,. 6-4, 7-6. He is only the third man this century - after Gustavo Kuerten and Rafael Nadal - to defend the title.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121716126,imgsize-155532,width-400,resizemode-4/121716126.jpg"

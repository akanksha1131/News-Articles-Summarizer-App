India Asia Cup squad: Why Shreyas Iyer and Shubman Gill are biggest talking points

Poll Do you agree with Yuvraj Singh that playing golf can help cricketers improve their game? Yes, absolutely! No, not really.

Ahead of the 2025 Asia Cup, the former India all-rounder has requested Shubman Gill and Abhishek Sharma not to repeat the mistake he made during his playing years and to play golf, as it will help them score more runs.""I have told them to play golf and I encourage them to play. It's very hard to find time, but I think the IPL is a good time for them to actually find time and hit some balls,"" Yuvraj said at an event.""It's up to them. Now they are superstars of the game and they have to decide what's going to help them be better. If golf can be something, then they have to decide that. But I encourage all athletes to play golf. I think it's a great way to unwind and it's great for the mind.""When asked whether playing golf would help them, Yuvraj said: ""I feel that any sport that helps you relax is going to be less taxing on the body and more fruitful for the mind. If you see the culture of golf in Australia, South Africa, England—majority of the best cricketers have played golf from a very young age.""You see a lot of these guys actually play a lot of golf and do less cricket practice during tours. You can't change something in a game in three days.But how can you recover and be mentally fresh for a game? So I just feel it's not just cricket. For any sportsperson in the world, they should play golf because eventually it will bring out the best in them in their sport.""Shubman Gill and Abhishek Sharma are set to open for India in the upcoming Asia Cup, starting next week.Yuvraj said if he had played golf during his playing years, he would have scored 3,000 more international runs.""I would have scored 3,000 more runs,"" said Yuvraj.""I tell all the young cricketers to try and play golf, hit the ball, see how you feel. Because sometimes too much practice is also not good for you. Sometimes when you're not scoring runs, you want to practice more, and with golf as well, you want to hit more balls. But sometimes it's good to relax,"" he said.","Yuvraj Singh says he would have scored 3,000 more international runs if he had played golf during his playing years. The former India all-rounder has requested Shubman Gill and Abhishek Sharma to play golf as it will help them score more runs.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123710385,imgsize-71426,width-400,resizemode-4/shubman-and-abhishek-sharma.jpg"

A major shock lit up the opening day of the FIDE Grand Swiss as 18-year-old Hungarian prodigy Zsóka Gaál defeated seasoned Ukrainian star Anna Muzychuk, the current world No.5. Gaál, rated 2388, capitalised when the 35-year-old Muzychuk, last year’s Women’s Norway Chess runner-up and champion this year, forgot about her clock in a tense endgame.At this level, such time oversights are exceedingly rare, which made the result even more dramatic.For Gaál, the youngest player in the field, it was a statement victory that showcased not just talent but also nerves of steel against one of the most experienced players on the circuit.Watch:In the open section, reigning world champion D Gukesh of India began his campaign with an emphatic win over French veteran Etienne Bacrot.Opting for the Caro-Kann Defense with black, Gukesh steered the game into a sharp middlegame, uncorking an exchange sacrifice that left Bacrot struggling.The 19-year-old Indian, already the youngest world champion in history, showed his trademark precision in complexities to score a full point.Elsewhere, top seed R Praggnanandhaa was held to a solid draw by American Jeffery Xiong. The game, arising from the French Defense exchange variation, never really veered out of balance, and a repetition sealed peace.Defending champion Vidit Gujrathi impressed with a convincing win against Germany’s Alexander Donchenko, while P Harikrishna suffered a setback, losing with white to Slovenian Anton Denchenkov. Nihal Sarin drew his opener against Svane Rasmus of Germany.In the women’s section, defending champion R Vaishali got off to a flying start by beating Gulrukhbegim Tokhirjonova of Uzbekistan. Vantika Agrawal also shone, defeating Ukraine’s Yulia Osmak, while D Harika was held to a draw by Israel’s Marcel Eforimski.The drama of Gaál’s upset and Gukesh’s dominant start has already set the tone for a thrilling tournament ahead.","18-year-old Hungarian prodigy Zsóka Gaál defeated seasoned Ukrainian star Anna Muzychuk, the current world No.5. reigning world champion D Gukesh of India began his campaign with an emphatic win over French veteran Etienne Bacrot.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123710198,imgsize-46786,width-400,resizemode-4/anna-muzychuk-vs-zska-gal-screengrab.jpg"

South Africa achieved a historic victory at Lord's, defeating England by 5 runs in the second ODI to secure their first bilateral ODI series win on English soil in 27 years. Under Temba Bavuma 's leadership, the Proteas took an unassailable 2-0 lead in the three-match series, with Matthew Breetzke 's outstanding 85 contributing to their total of 330.The last time South Africa won an ODI series in England was in 1998, when they defeated Adam Hollioake's team 2-1. They had since lost four ODI series to England in 2008, 2012, 2017, and 2022 before this current triumph.The series history between these teams in England shows varied results. South Africa lost the Texaco Trophy in 1994, won it in 1998, faced defeat in the 2008 NatWest Series, drew the 2012 NatWest Series, lost again in 2017, drew in 2022, and now leads the current 2025 series.England's recent form against South Africa has been concerning, with four consecutive ODI losses. Since the 2023 ODI World Cup, England have struggled in bilateral ODI series, winning just one out of six while South Africa claimed five victories.That said, Bavuma's captaincy has garnered loads of plaudits of late, especially on the back of their title-winning campaign at the ICC World Test Championship.The recent head-to-head record shows England's declining performance.They lost by 229 runs in Mumbai 2023, suffered defeats with 125 and 175 balls to spare in Karachi and Leeds 2025 respectively, and now this 5-run loss at Lord's.The match at Lord's set a new ODI record with a combined total of 655 runs. Matthew Breetzke and Tristan Stubbs formed a crucial partnership, scoring 58 runs in 101 balls, helping South Africa reach 330 for 8 in their 50 overs.England faced a challenging target, needing to surpass India's record of 326-8 from 2002, which remains the highest successful chase at Lord's. Despite their efforts, they fell short against South Africa's bowling attack, led by Nandre Burger 's 3/63 and Keshav Maharaj 's 2/59.This victory margin of 5 runs marks South Africa's second closest win against England in ODIs, following their one-run victory in Cape Town in 2000. England's current ODI performance statistics show a win percentage of just 31.8, winning only 7 out of 22 matches, with only Bangladesh and Zimbabwe having lower success rates among full member teams.The final match of the series is scheduled for September 7, with South Africa looking to complete a clean sweep while England aims to salvage pride with a consolation win.",South Africa defeated England by 5 runs in the second ODI at Lord's.

The build-up to the FIDE Grand Swiss 2025 in Samarkand has taken a dramatic turn after Uzbekistan’s top Grandmaster, Nodirbek Abdusattorov, delivered a bold statement aimed directly at reigning World Champion D Gukesh.In a light-hearted segment with FIDE’s media team, Abdusattorov was asked to share an “unpopular chess opinion”.Without hesitation, the 20-year-old fired a shot at the Indian prodigy: “Gukesh will lose his title in the next match. Is that controversial?” His comment quickly spread online, sparking debates among fans and pundits about whether it was playful banter or mind games ahead of a crucial tournament.The Grand Swiss carries huge stakes, as both the winner and runner-up earn tickets to the 2026 Candidates Tournament. The eventual winner of the Candidates will then challenge Gukesh for the world title later that year.Watch:For Gukesh, however, the Grand Swiss is not about qualification. As the reigning world champion, the 19-year-old is already guaranteed a place in the title match. Yet he chose to participate, stressing his desire to test himself in the Swiss format.“There are not many super strong open tournaments like this. It’s an opportunity for me to play differently and prove myself,” he said in a press conference on Wednesday.Gukesh also praised the competitiveness of the field, declining to name favourites, and even acknowledged Abdusattorov as “a great champion and competitor.” His calm tone contrasted sharply with Abdusattorov’s jab, underlining the contrasting approaches of the two rising stars.ALSO READ: FIDE Grand Swiss: Divya Deshmukh only Indian female in Open section; D Gukesh, surprisingly, in contention With Fabiano Caruana already securing a Candidates berth and India’s Praggnanandhaa almost certain to qualify via the FIDE circuit, the Grand Swiss promises to be a fierce battleground.

Pakistani cricketer Haider Ali, 24, has reportedly been cleared of rape charges in the UK after investigators found insufficient evidence. The Greater Manchester Police (GMP) and Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) have closed the case that began with his arrest on August 4 at the Spitfire County Cricket Ground in Kent, following accusations from a British-Pakistani woman.The woman had claimed she met Ali at a Manchester hotel on July 23, where the alleged incident took place. She said they met again on August 1 in Ashford before filing her complaint on August 4. Throughout the investigation, Ali maintained his innocence, stating he knew the woman as a friend and called the accusations ""shocking"" and ""false.""As per news reports, Ali's passport has been returned by the police, allowing him to leave the country at his discretion. The investigation's findings were strengthened by evidence showing the complainant had booked the hotel room under her name for what appeared to be a consensual meeting. The delayed filing of the complaint also weakened the case against Ali.During the investigation, Ali received legal representation from UK-based criminal law expert Barrister Moeen Khan. The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) had temporarily suspended Ali following their code of conduct for players involved in criminal cases.With the case now dismissed, he can resume his cricket career.Ali, who made his international debut in 2020, has played in 35 T20 internationals and two ODIs for Pakistan, scoring 499 runs in the T20 format. While he can now return to cricket, the PCB is expected to conduct its own internal inquiry upon his return to Pakistan.His last international appearance was at the 2023 Asian Games.","Pakistani cricketer Haider Ali, 24, has reportedly been cleared of rape charges in the UK.

India’s Gaming Revolution: New Law Changes EVERYTHING

Poll Do you believe that celebrity endorsements contribute to the popularity of online betting platforms? Yes, definitely Somewhat Not really

NEW DELHI: Former India cricketer Shikhar Dhawan has been summoned by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) in connection with its ongoing investigation into an alleged money laundering case linked to the online betting platform 1xBet. Officials confirmed that the 39-year-old cricketer has been asked to appear before the agency on Thursday for questioning.According to reports, Dhawan is likely to be questioned about his association with the betting app through endorsements. His statement will be recorded under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA). The ED is probing multiple such platforms that have allegedly duped investors of crores of rupees and evaded large sums in taxes.The summons to Dhawan comes weeks after his former India teammate Suresh Raina was questioned by the agency in the same case.Actor Rana Daggubati also deposed before the ED in Hyderabad in July after seeking a brief postponement due to professional commitments. In May, the Telangana Police booked 25 actors, including Prakash Raj, Manchu Lakshmi, Nidhi Agarwal, and TV anchor Srimukhi, over alleged betting promotions. Most have denied wrongdoing, claiming they only endorsed platforms in regions where online skill-based games are permitted.The government recently tightened its stance on such apps by banning real-money online gaming, citing risks of addiction, fraud, and money laundering. The ED’s probe has drawn parallels with the Mahadev betting scandal of 2023–24, which implicated several high-profile figures, including former Chhattisgarh chief minister Bhupesh Baghel.Officials indicated that Dhawan’s questioning is part of a broader crackdown on illegal betting platforms and celebrity promoters. More high-profile summonses are expected in the coming weeks as the inquiry widens.",Former India cricketer Shikhar Dhawan has been summoned by the Enforcement Directorate.

Former IPL chairman Lalit Modi has disclosed that he deliberately breached broadcasting rules during the inaugural IPL match in 2008 between Kolkata Knight Riders and Royal Challengers Bengaluru (then Royal Challengers Bangalore).Modi, who now resides in exile in the United Kingdom, was concerned about the viewership of the first game. He decided to override Sony's exclusive broadcasting rights, believing the network's reach was insufficient to generate the necessary audience.""Everything, everything was dependent on that one game. I broke every rule in the book that day. I signed the contract, an exclusive contract with Sony, but Sony didn't have the reach. I said open the signal. Now it was available everywhere, right? And I told all the broadcasters who lost out, all of you, all news channels, go live,"" Lalit told Michael Clarke during a recent podcast. ""Sony said 'I'll sue you'. I said 'Sue me later, forget about it? Ok, we are going live now because you don't have the reach'. I needed everybody to watch the first game. If the first game had flopped, I was dead.""While contemporary media reports do not extensively document these claims, the IPL proved highly successful for both Sony and Modi, who served as a BCCI board member at the time.The relationship between BCCI and Modi later became contentious, leading to legal disputes.In March 2009, BCCI terminated its broadcasting agreement with Sony Entertainment Television and World Sports Group, citing contract violations.Modi subsequently negotiated a new arrangement where Sony regained rights until 2017 for approximately 1.63 billion US dollars (around Rs. 8,200 crore).As part of this deal, World Sports Group received a facilitation fee of 425 crore rupees for relinquishing their claims.This payment drew attention from authorities as BCCI alleged Modi had exceeded his authority in modifying contracts and showing preference to WSG.The matter attracted investigation from the Enforcement Directorate and became part of legal proceedings against Modi.These allegations regarding contract modifications and favouritism toward WSG form a significant portion of the charges Modi currently faces.","Former IPL chairman Lalit Modi has disclosed that he deliberately breached broadcasting rules during the inaugural IPL match in 2008.

GST rate cuts: How the revised structure and reforms will impact cricket and the IPL,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/gst-rate-cuts-how-the-revised-structure-and-reforms-will-impact-cricket-and-the-ipl/articleshow/123689781.cms,"File photo of an IPL ticket featuring match between Chennai Super Kings and Royal Challengers Bengaluru.

Diwali Gift for Consumers: Govt Slashes GST Across Sectors, Prices to Drop from Sept 22

How GST changes impact IPL ticket prices:

A Rs. 500 ticket will now cost Rs. 700, instead of Rs. 640

A Rs. 1,000 ticket will now cost Rs. 1,400, instead of Rs. 1,280

A Rs. 2,000 ticket will now cost Rs. 2,800, instead of Rs 2,560

Cricket fans will now have to pay more to watch IPL matches from stadiums as the government has increased GST rates from 28% to 40%. This steep hike puts IPL tickets in the highest tax bracket alongside casinos and luxury goods, making it costlier for spectators across India. The new rates are part of a broader GST reform targeting high-end discretionary spending.The price increase is significant for cricket enthusiasts. A Rs 1,000 ticket that previously cost Rs 1,280 with GST will now set fans back Rs 1,400 - a Rs 120 jump. Similarly, a Rs 500 ticket now costs Rs 700 instead of Rs 640, while a Rs 2,000 ticket's final price has risen to Rs 2,800 from Rs 2,560.The new tax structure treats IPL viewing as a luxury activity, placing it in the same category as tobacco products and betting services.However, regular cricket matches continue to attract only 18% GST, making this change specific to premium sporting events like the IPL.In contrast, movie-goers have received some relief. Cinema tickets priced up to Rs 100 will now attract only 5% GST with input tax credit, down from the previous 12%. For tickets above Rs 100, the 18% GST rate remains unchanged.The impact on IPL spectators goes beyond just the ticket price. Fans must now factor in this higher tax rate along with additional costs like stadium charges and online booking fees. This makes watching live IPL matches a more expensive affair for cricket enthusiasts across the country.",Cricket fans will now have to pay more to watch IPL matches from stadiums as the government has increased GST rates from 28% to 40%.

Poll Who do you think will win the javelin event at the World Athletics Championships? Arshad Nadeem Neeraj Chopra Another competitor It's too close to call

Pakistan’s Olympic javelin champion Arshad Nadeem has been declared “fully fit” by his doctor, setting the stage for a blockbuster showdown with India’s reigning world champion Neeraj Chopra at the upcoming World Athletics Championships in Tokyo, beginning September 13.The 28-year-old underwent surgery on his right calf in Cambridge in July 2025, forcing him to miss the Diamond League circuit. His return has heightened anticipation for what promises to be one of the highlights of the tournament.Dr. Asad Abbas, who supervised Nadeem’s recovery, expressed complete satisfaction with his rehabilitation.“Arshad has fully recovered, and I have monitored his rehab and progress. I am sure he will be right up there to compete with Neeraj and all others who will be lined up for the javelin event,” Abbas told Telecom Asia Sport. He added: “I am confident he will achieve better results than he did in Paris.”The Chopra–Nadeem rivalry has become one of athletics’ most compelling narratives.At the Budapest World Championships in 2023, Chopra clinched gold with a throw of 88.17m, edging Nadeem’s silver-winning 87.82m by just 35 centimeters.While Chopra boasts Olympic gold from Tokyo 2021 (87.58m) and multiple continental titles, Nadeem etched his name into history at the Paris Olympics 2024, unleashing a mammoth 92.97m throw to secure Pakistan’s first Olympic gold in 32 years.However, Nadeem’s preparations for Tokyo have faced hurdles. His coach Salman Butt revealed that torrential rains in Lahore disrupted throwing practice at Punjab Stadium.“Training has been affected by the rains that have been ongoing for the past several days. Throwing practice is very risky during the rainy season,” Butt said. “Hopefully, after the rains stop, we will focus on throwing.”Despite weather setbacks, Butt confirmed that Nadeem is training “vigorously” and remains on track for Tokyo.

NEW DELHI: Ruturaj Gaikwad on Thursday reflected on how he used his near five-month injury-enforced layoff to work on his red-ball game, though the India batter admitted he still has “a long way to go” in the traditional format despite starting the season strongly.Gaikwad injured his elbow in early April during an IPL 2025 match against Rajasthan Royals, cutting short his stint as Chennai Super Kings skipper. The setback also ruled him out of the India A series against the England Lions before the Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy. He later withdrew from a County contract with Yorkshire due to personal reasons.Despite the disappointment, Gaikwad found positives in the enforced break.""I had good time to prepare, especially after not being part of the India A series. And then after that coming back, I decided to work on my red ball game, give it some amount of time and obviously still working on it, still long way to go,"" he said after scoring 184 for West Zone on the opening day of the Duleep Trophy semifinal against Central Zone.The effort followed his century against Himachal Pradesh in the Buchi Babu invitational tournament, marking his second successive hundred.On returning after the break, Gaikwad admitted it wasn’t easy.""Not really. Actually, it was just about following the process. The red ball game actually needs a lot of patience, a lot of process to be followed and it was just about getting into that rhythm. And you know, I did it for almost one, one and a half months and obviously Buchi Babu as well and then it happened here as well,"" he said.He added that time away from cricket gave him mental calmness and the chance to spend quality time with family.""I mean, nobody would want to have a family time being injured. It was a very fluke injury and nothing anyone can do about it. So, I just enjoyed my time at home and then obviously trying to get into the rhythm, get into the game routines, you know, do the small things and really loved the process throughout.”The 28-year-old has also adapted to batting at No. 4, a role he often plays for Maharashtra and sometimes for CSK.“I won't say it is 2.0 because, you know, I think in white ball, I always opened but in red ball, there was only one spot available in Maharashtra when I joined the team. So, I think that was the only spot available. Whenever, you know, there were two proper openers playing, I always used to play at three. So, definitely, there were no real spots for me but now obviously, I feel I am really comfortable there,” he said.His composure was evident in the semifinal when, walking in at 10 for two, he steadied West Zone with a big hundred.“I thought it was a good challenge to be part of because obviously, three really good (Central Zone) fast bowlers, you know, with great skill set and to be able to face them, to be able to score runs against them would be a great challenge. That is what I thought and obviously, I stick to it and am really happy that it came off,” he added.Gaikwad also praised Tanush Kotian, with whom he shared a 148-run stand for the sixth wicket.“He always bats really well. He has the knack of scoring runs. He has proper Mumbai brain, really street smart and knows when to score runs, knows when to soak up the pressure. So, you know, he is always done in front of me and even today, he batted really well,” he said.Recently, MS Dhoni said Gaikwad’s return would strengthen CSK’s batting in IPL 2026, a remark Gaikwad welcomed.“From him, the support was always there. There was nothing to be shy about and obviously, you know, me missing that tournament and then later on having some replacements (Ayush Mhatre, Shaikh Rasheed etc). It really strengthened the squad (in IPL 2025) and then obviously, me joining back again would really strengthen it again. So, I feel that is what he said,” Gaikwad explained.",Ruturaj Gaikwad returns from injury after near five-month layoff. India batsman scored 184 in Duleep Trophy semifinal against Central Zone.

Former India cricketer Yograj Singh , father of Yuvraj Singh, has launched a scathing attack on cricket legends MS Dhoni Kapil Dev , and Bishan Singh Bedi, accusing them of mistreating players. At the same time, ex-India allrounder Irfan Pathan addressed a resurfaced video controversy linked to Dhoni ’s captaincy.Yograj alleged that former captains failed their teammates. He singled out Dhoni, who led India to the 2007 T20 World Cup, 2011 ODI World Cup, and 2013 Champions Trophy, as well as Kapil Dev, India’s 1983 World Cup-winning skipper.""I talk about Bishan Singh Bedi, Kapil Dev, MS Dhoni. I can talk about people whom I have been with. They have treated people like shit. Jo galat hai wo galat hai. Two wrongs cannot make one right. I say this openly, that our cricketers and team were destroyed by our captain,"" Yograj told a website.Meanwhile, Pathan responded after a clip from an old interview went viral on social media. The video showed him speaking about his 2008 ouster from the Indian team under Dhoni’s leadership.Pathan wrote on X (formerly Twitter): ""Half decade old video surfacing NOW with a twisted context to the Statement. Fan war? PR lobby?""The clip also featured Pathan’s Hindi remark about not having the habit of setting up hookah in someone’s room, in reference to favoritism.Yograj backed Pathan’s claims, pointing to other players who had spoken against Dhoni.""It is not only about Irfan Pathan. You see Gautam Gambhir speaking about it. Virender Sehwag openly said about it as well. Harbhajan Singh spoke about how he was put out of the team like a fly. You should arrange a jury on why he did what he did. MS Dhoni doesn't want to answer.

JAGADEESAN DRIVES SOUTH

BENGALURU: An injury and personal issues kept Ruturaj Gaikwad away from competitive cricket for over four months. The return was lukewarm initially during the Buchi Babu invitational tournament, but he found rhythm in his last outing of the TNCA conducted tournament with a fine century.On Thursday, Day 1 of West Zone’s Duleep Trophy semifinals against Central Zone here, the 28-year-old was all class and composure. Even as the Shardul Thakur-led side lost a couple of quick wickets in the first session after opting to bat, Gaikwad, who came two down, went about his job with clinical precision. When stumps were drawn, West were 363/6 in 87 overs.In an anti-climax to an otherwise impressive innings, Gaikwad’s 324-minute stay at the crease was halted when he stepped out and was beaten by the flight of Saransh Desai's delivery and Central wicketkeeper Upendra Yadav caught him short of the crease. It was a rare occasion when Gaikwad, who chose to play it late otherwise, stepped out. Missing out on a double hundred when he was set for it may have been disappointing, but 206-ball innings (25x4; 1x6) in testing conditions could prove decisive.Earlier, with the sun playing hide and seek, Central’s new-ball duo of Khaleel Ahmed and Deepak Chahar probed the batters. Gaikwad, in the company of Aarya Desai (39), weathered it while they waited for the spinners to go after.Once Gaikwad settled down, he stepped on the pedal, bringing up his century in 131 deliveries.Gaikwad started the final session with a bang, dispatching Yash Thakur for three consecutive boundaries. During an exhibition of lofted drive and detectable cuts off a Khaleel Ahmed, Gaikwad struck four boundaries and a maximum, during which he also crossed the 150-mark. Gaikwad shared a crucial 184-ball 148 run association with Tanush Kotian, who remained unbeaten on 65.Before the rush of runs, the first session belonged to the Central Zone. Yashasvi Jaiswal lasted all of three deliveries and was trapped in front by Khaleel, while Harvik Desai poked a Chahar delivery, which Yash Rathod took at first slip.Shreyas Iyer (25), playing his first match after the Asia Cup snub, survived a lifeline on nought when Ahmed misjudged a catch. Just when Iyer was getting into the groove, he was done in by a straight delivery from Khaleel, which he attempted to late cut and chopped onto his middle stump.In the other semifinals, South opener N Jagadeesan survived a dismissal off a no-ball from Anshul Kamboj and made the most of it against Central Zone. The Tamil Nadu batter was on nine when he nicked a Kamboj delivery to wicketkeeper Kanhaiya Wadhawan, only to be called back after the pacer was found to have overstepped. Over the next five hours, he crafted an unbeaten 260-ball-148 (13x4; 2x6). At stumps, South were 297/3 in 81 overs. The match started half an hour late due to overnight rain and South, asked to bat, got down to business in quick time. Jagadeesan's 103-run opening partnership with Tanmay Agarwal (43) set the tone for the day, and he built on it with southpaw Devdutt Padikkal, who scored a 71-ball 57.Brief scores: South Zone: 297/3 in 81 overs (Tanmay Agarwal 43, N Jagadeesan 148 n.o., Devdutt Padikkal 57; Nishant Sindhu 2-59) vs North Zone.West Zone: 363/6 in 87 overs (Aarya Desai 39, Ruturaj Gaikwad 184, Shreyas Iyer 25, Tanush Kotian 64 n.o.; Khaleel Ahmed 2-70, Saransh Jain 2-109) vs Central Zone.",Ruturaj Gaikwad scored a fine century in West Zone's Duleep Trophy semifinal. The 28-year-old was all class and composure on Day 1 of the TNCA conducted tournament. N Jagadeesan scored an unbeaten 260-ball-148 in South Zone's semifinal win.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123701147,imgsize-29948,width-400,resizemode-4/ruturaj-0409-sd.jpg"

A Tanzanian football match came to a dramatic standstill after an unexpected visitor disrupted play: a massive swarm of bees.The unusual incident unfolded mid-game when the swarm descended across the stadium, forcing everyone on the pitch and in the technical area to drop to the ground in an attempt to avoid being stung.Players, coaches, match officials, and even the broadcast crew were all seen lying flat as the buzzing cloud swept over the field.Watch:Footage from the match quickly spread on social media, drawing both shock and amusement from fans.One fan described it as “Football in Tanzania turned into WWE whole stadium hitting the floor for bees instead of goals,"" as another wrote: ""Never seen this type of game management at Upton Park. Bees taking more control of the midfield than most holding players I've coached. At least the lads kept their shape lying down!""Fortunately, no injuries were reported, and the bees eventually moved on, allowing the game to resume.While weather delays, power outages, or pitch invasions are not uncommon in football, incidents involving wildlife are far rarer, though Africa has seen occasional interruptions from animals such as birds, dogs, and even cows wandering into stadiums.For the players, the bee invasion was a moment of real tension, but for global audiences, it became an instant viral clip, showcasing the unpredictability of live sport.The match later continued without further disruption, but fans will likely remember the bizarre stoppage more than the final scoreline.","A massive swarm of bees disrupted a football match in Tanzania.

Tottenham Hotspur confirmed on Thursday that Daniel Levy has stepped down as Executive Chairman, bringing an end to a tenure that spanned almost 25 years.Levy, who joined the club’s board in 2000 following ENIC’s takeover, oversaw one of the most transformative periods in the club’s history.

Tottenham Hotspur fullback Djed Spence has been named in the England squad for the upcoming World Cup qualifiers against Andorra and Serbia, marking his maiden senior call-up. The 25-year-old could also make history by becoming the first openly Muslim footballer to represent the national team.The Football Association has acknowledged the moment as a landmark, ahead of Saturday’s qualifier at Villa Park. For Spence, the call-up represents not only recognition of his performances but also a personal milestone, from coming up through the ranks, playing for Fulham Youth, Boro, Middlesbrough, Nottingham Forest, a loan to French side Stade Rennais and then Leeds United before finally cementing his place in the Spurs side.Spence’s career has been far from straightforward. A product of Middlesbrough, he moved to Tottenham in 2022 after impressing at Nottingham Forest. Loan spells followed at Rennes, Leeds and Genoa before he finally began to establish himself under Ange Postecoglou last season. Along the way, he has faced public criticism from former managers Antonio Conte and Neil Warnock.At Tottenham, the defender has grown into a popular figure.Supporters have consistently backed him, often calling for his inclusion in the starting lineup even when he was on the bench initially. His energy and versatility in both full-back roles have made him a valuable presence in the squad.This season in the Premier League, the player has appeared in all three of Spurs' games under new boss Thomas Frank, accumulating 270 minutes so far. While he's yet to make a direct goal contribution, the player is well on his way to making history.England's games in the international break are against Andorra on Saturday, September 6 and then Serbia next Wednesday.Now, with an England debut within reach, Spence has the chance to mark a new chapter, both in his career and in English football as a whole.",Djed Spence has been named in the England squad for the upcoming World Cup qualifiers against Andorra and Serbia.

Poll Do you think FIFA is doing enough to combat racism in football? Yes, they are taking strong actions No, they need to do more

FIFA has imposed heavy sanctions on six national football federations, including defending world champion Argentina, following incidents of racist abuse during World Cup qualifiers in June.The governing body’s disciplinary committee listed Albania, Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Serbia and Bosnia-Herzegovina among those punished for “discrimination and racist abuse.”While details of the incidents were not disclosed, the fines highlight FIFA’s focus on tackling racism in football.Albania received the heaviest sanction, a fine of over ₹1.75 crore ($200,000). The federation was charged for multiple offenses during its June 7 home match against Serbia, including disturbing a national anthem and transmitting “a message that is not appropriate for a sports event.” FIFA also ordered a 20% reduction in stadium capacity for a future home fixture.Albania drew 0-0 with Serbia in Tirana, with the reverse fixture scheduled in Belgrade on October 11.Argentina was fined ₹1.3 crore ($149,000) for fan-related discrimination during its 1-1 draw against Colombia on June 10 in Buenos Aires.Midfielder Enzo Fernández, sent off in that match for a dangerous tackle, was additionally handed a two-game suspension and fined ₹5.4 lakh ($6,200).Argentina has already qualified for next year’s World Cup in the United States, Canada and Mexico.Chile’s federation was fined 115,000 Swiss francs ($143,000) after racist abuse marred its 1-0 loss to Argentina on June 5.Colombia was sanctioned 70,000 Swiss francs ($87,000) for fan behavior in its June 6 home game against Peru.Serbia must pay 50,000 Swiss francs ($62,000) for incidents during its June 10 clash with Andorra, while Bosnia-Herzegovina was fined 21,000 Swiss francs ($26,000) following its qualifier against San Marino.In addition to financial penalties, FIFA instructed all six federations to implement “prevention plans” for future matches.Additionally, FIFA closed an investigation into alleged racist abuse during the Club World Cup.Real Madrid defender Antonio Rüdiger had accused Pachuca captain Gustavo Cabral of racism, but the case was dismissed due to lack of evidence. Cabral, who denied the charge, said he had used an insult common in Argentina.","FIFA has imposed heavy sanctions on six national football federations, including defending world champion Argentina.

Poll Do you believe the sentence given to the Espanyol supporter is sufficient to deter future incidents of racism in football? Yes, it sets a strong precedent. No, harsher penalties are needed.

A Barcelona court has sentenced an Espanyol supporter to one year in prison for racially abusing Athletic Bilbao striker Inaki Williams during a league match in January 2020.The individual was found guilty of directing racist chants and gestures at the Ghana international inside the RCDE Stadium. While the ruling imposes a custodial sentence, Spanish law allows the fan to avoid serving time because it is under two years and there are no prior convictions.In addition, the court imposed a fine of around 1,000 euros (over ₹1 lakh) and issued a three-year ban from entering football stadiums. The High Court of Justice of Catalonia confirmed the sanctions in a statement.The Spanish Prosecutor’s Office had initially sought a two-year sentence but later reached an agreement with the accused.La Liga welcomed the decision, stressing its wider significance. “Today’s ruling represents another milestone in the fight against racism in football and the eradication of all forms of violence inside and outside stadiums,” the league said, as quoted by AFP.The incident forms part of a recurring pattern in Spanish football, where high-profile players have frequently been subjected to abuse. Earlier this year, another Espanyol–Athletic clash at the same venue was halted following allegations that visiting forward Maroan Sannadi faced racist taunts from home fans.Several other cases have also reached the courts. In June 2024, three Valencia supporters were sentenced to eight months in prison for abusing Real Madrid’s Vinicius Junior. That same month, four Atletico Madrid ultras received suspended jail terms after hanging a dummy of the Brazilian from a bridge in what authorities classified as a hate crime.Alongside Vinicius, both Inaki and his brother Nico Williams have emerged as central figures in the campaign against racism in Spanish football.","A Barcelona court has sentenced an Espanyol supporter to one year in prison for racially abusing Athletic Bilbao striker Inaki Williams during a league match in January 2020.

Portugal’s first international camp since the tragic death of Diogo Jota was marked by a deeply emotional gesture from his close friend and teammate Ruben Neves. The 28-year-old midfielder unveiled a striking tattoo on the back of his left leg, depicting him embracing Jota, a moving homage to the Liverpool forward who lost his life in a car crash in Spain on July 3.The tattoo, which shows Neves holding Jota in his iconic “Diogo J 21” shirt, is inscribed with the words: “You will never be forgotten. We are 23+1.” It has since gone viral, becoming a symbol of the Portuguese team’s grief and unity.“More than friendship, we are family,” Neves said in a video shared by the Portuguese Football Federation . “When we’re at the table, in the locker room, or on the plane, you will still be with us.”Neves, who played alongside Jota at Porto, Wolves, and for Portugal, helped carry his coffin at the funeral and will now wear the No.21 jersey in his memory. Manager Roberto Martínez explained: “The No.21 jersey will go to Rúben Neves because, that way, that number will remain on the field and with all of us. He had a very close relationship with Diogo and is the ideal person to represent him.”Earlier, the national team joined Jota’s family, widow Rute Cardoso, agent Jorge Mendes, and Portuguese leaders President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa and Prime Minister Luís Montenegro in an official ceremony. A bronze framed Portugal shirt bearing Jota’s No.21 was unveiled at the training base in Lisbon. Cristiano Ronaldo and teammates, dressed in suits, stood in solemn tribute as Neves delivered a handwritten letter to his late friend: “Life brought us together and nothing can break that bond… From today on, you’ll step on to the pitch with us.”","Portugal's first international camp since the tragic death of Diogo Jota was marked by a deeply emotional gesture from his close friend and teammate Ruben Neves.

What’s common between the three Formula E world champions

How the three World Champions fared in Formula E Season 11

Days after Oliver Rowland lifted his Formula E World Championship trophy in London this season, an interesting trend has come to the attention of Formula E and its fans. As a coincidence, all Formula E drivers who won the Mexico City E-Prix went on to win the Formula E World Championship that season, and this has been proved right for three consecutive years.Highlighting the same since 2023, a poster of three World Champions was shared on X by Formula E with the caption, “The trend continues. Each winner of the #MexicoCityEPrix from the past three seasons has gone on to become World Champion.”The special poster features 2023 Formula E World Champion Jake Dennis from Andretti, then TAG Heuer Porsche’s Pascal Wehrlein, who won in 2024, and the new World Champion, Nissan driver Oliver Rowland. All three of them won in the Mexico E-Prix and went on to lift the winner’s trophy in the Formula E World Championship that year.Oliver Rowland had strengthened his chances of winning the Formula E World Championship this year much earlier. He was leading the Formula E Driver Standings ever since he won Part 2 of the Jeddah E-Prix, which was his second win of the season after winning the Mexico E-Prix. In the last leg, the Nissan driver got nervous for a while as Pascal Wehrlein, who was following him in the number two position, closed the gap after grabbing quite a few podiums while Rowland had a dull period.Things became serious for Rowland when he failed to finish the Round 13 race in Berlin, while Wehrlein won second spot on the podium. But he eventually managed to confirm his championship in Berlin after four wins and three more podiums.Sharing about his bad race in Berlin, Rowland had said, “I was hoping before the weekend that the outcome could be [the World Championship], but after yesterday (Saturday) and this morning (Sunday), I was more worried that it might never come.”Also Read: Oliver Rowland reacts to daughter’s sweet radio message after Formula E Championship win: “It’s amazing” Things, however, changed for Wehrlein, who was pushed to third position after Nick Cassidy made a late entry in the Formula E Driver Standings by registering three consecutive wins. He was pushed from second place to third, with Cassidy in second. Wehrlein registered one win and five more podiums this season.Meanwhile, Andretti driver Jake Dennis finished in seventh position in the Formula E Driver Standings. He won two podium spots this season.","All three Formula E drivers who won the Mexico City E-Prix went on to win the Formula E World Championship that season.

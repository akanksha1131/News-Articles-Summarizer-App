India, left-handers and off-spin: Why hosts need to be very worried

Poll Should India change their winning combination for the upcoming match against South Africa? Yes, they should make changes No, stick to the winning team Only if there's a significant reason

India’s formidable depth has become both their greatest strength and their only selection headache as the defending champions march unbeaten into the Super Eight stage of the ICC Men's T20 World Cup. A win over the Netherlands extended their winning streak in the tournament to 12 matches and reinforced the impression of a side with few weaknesses — but according to former coach Ravi Shastri, one crucial dilemma remains.Shastri believes India are unlikely to tinker with a winning combination when they face South Africa in a blockbuster clash on Sunday, insisting the current XI ticks nearly every box.“I think it will be pretty much the same side because you've got depth, you've got all bases covered, you've got options, you need options,” Shastri told ICC Review.He stressed the importance of flexibility, particularly in conditions where dew could influence team balance.“When there's dew around, you need that extra bowling option. Whether it's a Shivam Dube, whether it's Hardik bowling his full quota of overs, whether it's Tilak Varma who might roll his arm for an over or two, you need those options.I don't think they'll tinker with the side. I think the team that played in the last game was a good side,” he said.India’s campaign so far has been defined by collective contributions rather than reliance on individuals, something Shastri views as a major positive.“In every game there's been someone who stood up. It has been Ishan Kishan, sometimes Surya in the first game. Tilak Varma has played his part… I still think the best of him is still to come,” he noted. “I look at it as a positive that Abhishek Sharma has got three zeros. So, save your best for the important periods in the tournament. Teams will be a little worried that he's not got runs.”However, Shastri identified one key selection call: whether to play Axar Patel or Washington Sundar. Both offer spin and batting depth, but only one spot is available.Beyond selection, Shastri expects a high-quality contest between two in-form sides at the Narendra Modi Stadium.“There's a lot of self-belief and it's going to be a cracking contest because South Africa are no pushovers,” he said. “They've got depth in batting. India have got depth in batting. These are two of the strongest teams.”Familiarity with conditions could play a role, but Shastri warned dew may ultimately decide the outcome.“When you're familiar with the ground… you know what lengths to bowl. The thing to see is the amount of dew. Toss can play a crucial role.”","Shastri believes India are unlikely to tinker with a winning combination when they face South Africa in a blockbuster clash on Sunday.

T20 World Cup: Suryakumar Yadav press conference ahead of India vs South Africa

Poll Do you think Abhishek Sharma and Tilak Varma will regain their form before the end of the T20 World Cup? Yes, they will bounce back No, they may struggle further

AHMEDABAD: Abhishek Sharma and Tilak Varma have been India’s T20I batting trump cards over the five months leading up to this T20 World Cup. They have complemented each other while manning the top-order by being equally destructive and bankable. As both of them struggled to hit their stride in the first fortnight of the tournament, it now appears their form is correlated.Both stayed away from the optional practice session on Saturday afternoon even as Ishan Kishan and Rinku Singh practised power-hitting for 90 minutes, stewing in their own sweat under the blazing sun at the Narendra Modi stadium.India captain Suryakumar Yadav didn’t try to veil Varma’s struggles. 106 runs in four innings at a strike-rate of around 120 doesn’t reflect the potential or the core principles of this team’s T20 batting. “I am sure he must not be happy with how he is batting right now. He has practiced a lot as well in the last 2-3 practice sessions,” was Surya’s candid take on Varma’s form. “But I don’t have any concerns about him. He has done well for India at this position,” he added.Abhishek’s consistent belligerence in the Powerplay has played a great part in liberating India’s middle order in the last five months.His failure to get started has coincided with Tilak’s rather indecisive approach. “The team management has told him that he has to bat this way. If only one wicket falls, then he definitely can play his own game in the Powerplay. But, as soon as two wickets are down, then he has to take a backseat and get a partnership again to reach the 10th over. After that we have enough firepower to take on the bowling. If the team feels that any player, like Tilak or me, if he has to bat with a strike rate of 200 or 150, then he will do it,” Surya reasoned.The extent of Abhishek’s impact could be gauged as the Indian batting has looked visibly chained and refused to even come close to replicating the astronomic scores from the two preceding bilateral series against South Africa and New Zealand. “We are trying to explode from the start. Because that is their (the batters’) template. But at the end, we don't want to be a team that keeps on hitting,” Surya mentioned.“Honestly, I didn’t think we could score 230, 250, 270 so easily in the first place. I am actually worried for those who are worried for Abhishek. We want to play with his identity. We know what happens when he gets going,” the captain said with a smirk.Tilak has not taken off despite Ishan Kishan ruthlessly taking down bowling attacks in the Powerplay. That said, the team isn’t willing to press the panic button yet. Both Abhishek and Tilak are playing their first World Cup. The backup at disposal currently doesn’t inspire much confidence either with Sanju Samson going off the boil. Having endured an 18-month run of poor form, Surya feels its time the team paid Abhishek and Tilak back. “Last year, they covered everything for us. This time, rest of us will do it,” Surya stated.",Abhishek Sharma and Tilak Varma have been India’s T20I batting trump cards over the five months leading up to this T20 World Cup.

India, left-handers and off-spin: Why hosts need to be very worried

The familiarity factor

Treading cautiously

The black soil pitch

AHMEDABAD: The T20 World Cup has entered the Super 8 stage. The tournament, designed to soothe commercial nerves by pre-seeding teams, has lost some of its organic charm along the way. The finalists from the last edition, India and South Africa, have reached Ahmedabad for a fresh bout. Unlike second rounds of World Cups in other sports, they have had the luxury of planning for this day, at this venue, since the ICC released the fixtures in late Nov. All they had to do was avoid an upset against Associate and lower-ranked teams in the first fortnight of the tournament.Now that both sides have had at least one scare in the group stage, they will turn up on Sunday evening in front of a packed crowd with little room for excuses and an unforgiving weight of expectations. The tournament is in its ‘no let-up zone’. “If I am in that situation (to decide tournament fixtures), I will definitely try and tweak it,” was India captain Suryakumar Yadav’s honest confession on the teams being pre-seeded.The financial scars from the ODI World Cups in 2003 and 2007 still haunt the caretakers of the sport. In trying to guard against that, the format has reduced the element of surprise in a global event.Familiarity with conditions and opponents will be the last of the concerns in either camp, having played each other India barely a couple of months ago. South Africa, for instance, come into this match having already played three matches at this venue with another to go after Sunday.“I think almost all the players have played N number of games in Ahmedabad. Even the Indian team has played a lot of games here. It’s going to be a good 50-50 competition,” Surya stated on match eve. But he was also prompt to mention that the overseas players’ exposure to franchise has anyway negated that home advantage to a great extent.“We know what teams we are playing. And we also had a good number of days in between previous games. So, we got good time to prepare for every team,” Surya highlighted the benefits of being pre-seeded.South Africa wicketkeeper Quinton de Kock suggested this familiarity could be a double-edged sword. “That’s what’s going to make for quite a good game tomorrow because we've played against each other quite a bit over the last two months. And to be honest the teams haven’t really changed much. We’ve played against each other a lot in the IPL. So, it’s just a matter of being out there, who crumbles under pressure first,” De Kock claimed.Surya, since the beginning of the campaign, has never denied the pressure of playing a World Cup at home, let alone defending the title. For once, since becoming India’s T20I captain, he eschewed his characteristic quips in media briefings on Saturday evening. “I never said we don’t have any fear. I only said that we are not worried about anything,” he firmly corrected the media.He didn’t deny whispers about the law of averages catching up with India’s rampaging run in ICC white-ball tournaments in the last two years. Neither did he downplay the fact that the collapse against USA at the top of the tournament had shaken the core strategy of the team. That jailbreak in Mumbai grounded Surya’s high-flying bunch of T20 hitmen. “Since that USA game, we have not been thinking too much about how we plan to start our Super 8 campaign. We started thinking more about the next day, taking one step at a time. There will be pressure. If there is no pressure, there won’t be any fun in playing this game,” Surya stated.South Africa deflated Indian cricket’s ego, sweeping the two-Test series in India in Nov. They bare open India’s fragility against the turning ball, which has interestingly continued to dominate discussions even during this World Cup. De Kock was blunt in mentioning that he has seen no turn at this venue in the three previous games.On Sunday, the curators will roll out the 22-yard surface made of black soil. The red-soil pitches have stayed under the lush green layer of grass. TOI understands that the team had identified that playing on a red-soil pitch, which usually offers better bounce than a black-soil pitch, in the second Test in Guwahati worked in favour of the South Africans. The murmurs suggested that the SENA teams are much more comfortable with greater bounce even if the pitch took turn or played slow. The Indian team has practiced on black soil pitches at the centre square here for two days.Surya has entered the most crucial week of his captaincy career. The preparations could not have been any better. Now, as De Kock said, it’s down to who blinks first!","The T20 World Cup has entered the Super 8 stage.

Heavy rain forecast in Sri Lanka | Pakistan T20 World Cup dream over?

Poll Who do you think will win the Super 8 match between Sri Lanka and England? Sri Lanka England Draw/No Result

Dark clouds have loomed over Kandy this week, with rain sweeping across the Hanthana mountain range and keeping the covers on at the Pallekele International Cricket Stadium on Saturday.More showers are expected on Sunday, threatening to intrude on this T20 World Cup Super 8 contest between Sri Lanka and England. If the weather relents, a duel of spin could define the clash.England return to familiar territory after brushing aside Sri Lanka 3-0 in a T20I series here earlier this month. That success provides reassurance, especially after a stuttering group-stage campaign in which they edged Nepal by four runs, lost to West Indies by 30, then beat Scotland by five wickets and Italy by 24 runs.England captain Harry Brook conceded that his team were “too careful with the bat” in the group stage. “We’ve been too careful with the bat. We can probably be a bit more brave in certain situations and have more faith in the guys behind us to be able to put up a decent score,” he said, adding, “We probably underestimated a few of the teams and they put up a really good fight. Thankfully, we are in the Super 8s.”Sri Lanka’s journey has followed a similar arc of promise and pause.Comfortable wins over Ireland and Oman set the tone and a chase of 182 against Australia at this venue showcased their credentials. Yet, a stumble against Zimbabwe in Colombo has stalled their momentum.For the co-hosts, much rests on opener Pathum Nissanka , who struck an unbeaten 52-ball century against Australia. With 199 runs in the group stage, he sits among the leading scorers. Brook reckoned Nissanka’s form will be a threat and said England have plans to remove him early. Kusal Mendis , with three half-centuries in four innings, adds gravitas at the top of the order.However, the absence of pacer Matheesha Pathirana, ruled out for the remainder of the competition, has dented their bowling resources. Maheesh Theekshana’s six wickets, meanwhile, underline his importance.With the ball, legspinner Adil Rashid remains vital to England’s plans, supported by Jofra Archer’s pace. Rashid has six wickets in the tournament, including 2/16 against West Indies, highlighting his threat on surfaces that grip. Asked if Jacob Bethell is fit to bowl, Brook said: “Not sure yet, he’s got a decent cut in his finger. If there’s some way we can get around that, then we’d bowl him.”",England face Sri Lanka in the T20 World Cup Super 8 on Sunday. Sri Lanka beat England 3-0 in a T20I series here earlier this month.

Right from the build-up to the start of the T20 World Cup, all the noise has surrounded India's famed batting line-up. The broadcaster has relentlessly hyped the 300-mark and even after four group stage games, the talk remains focused on Indian batting. Reasons may vary, but the subject has seldom changed and all pre-match discussions have revolved around Abhishek Sharma's three ducks, Ishan Kishan's heroics, the slowdown by Tilak Varma and Suryakumar Yadav , or the firepower in the lower order. Batting has remained the keyword and it has always been in this unforgiving format.Bowlers are often under appreciated based on their statistics — economy rate, wickets column — which rarely reveal the big picture or how they performed in the larger context of the match. A 35-ball fifty always trumps a 4-0-30-0 but the latter often makes the former look better than it has been.While the batting unit has been the talk of the town, the potent bowling unit has slipped under the radar, but has continued to be the real deal. Varun Chakravarthy is the No.1 ranked T20I bowler, Arshdeep Singh has been a force in the format. Jasprit Bumrah continues to be brilliant, Axar Patel is smart and the two all-rounders -- Hardik Pandya and Shivam Dube -- are genuine options, not just fillers. Not to forget the additional options in Kuldeep Yadav and Washington Sundar .When India embraced the slam-bang mode in the format, their complete bowling attack provided underlying confidence. On days the approach backfired, bowlers were there to do the job. Like they were in that 2024 T20 World Cup final vs South Africa. Even on a bad day for Kuldeep and Axar, Hardik, Bumrah and Arshdeep combined to pull things back when they almost slipped away, helping India secure the elusive silverware. Now for them to defend the title, and become the only team to do so, the bowlers will hold the key. As the famous saying goes, ""batters can win you matches but it's the bowlers who win you tournaments,"" and India have the most dangerous and well-rounded attack in the tournament.When the questioning predictably focused on India's batting — specifically their vulnerabilities against spin and the sluggishness in the middle overs — captain Suryakumar highlighted the efforts of the bowling unit's and explained why he takes so much ""pride"" in them.""I take a lot of pride in my bowling unit. I know that on a given day, I always used to think that if we ever made 170, 175, or 180 in T20 cricket, then the high risk, high reward game we are trying to play, if we ever get stuck in 180, then we have so much good bowling that it can save the match, it can win that game,"" said Surya.Even in their last group game against the Netherlands, the Indian team management wanted to prepare their bowlers for future challenges. The decision to bat first for the game was primarily made to give them a taste of dew.""When I had practiced here before the Netherlands game, there was very heavy dew one day before when we practiced. So we thought, why not bat first, take that pressure and then later put bowlers under little bit of pressure, bowl them under dew because we have not bowled under dew a lot. We didn't face a lot of dew when we were at Wankhede, Delhi also. So it's better they get an opportunity also to bowl in the dew and so that we are well prepared for it,"" explained Surya.The opposition has been busy planning for players like Abhishek, Kishan and Surya but significant attention is also paid to countering Bumrah & co. The different challenges which each of them bring to the table can be a nightmare for a batting unit to plan for, and South Africa have been no different. That familiar feeling exists because the two teams played in a bilateral series not long ago, and senior batter Quinton de Kock hoped the batters would apply their learnings to counter India's x-factor Varun.""He's (Varun) a good bowler, a very good bowler at the moment. And obviously he bowled really well against us in the series, like two months ago. Hopefully the guys have, after that series, just had a little bit more time to have a look at him, speak about how they're going to play against him. So hopefully with their plans it comes off and if it doesn't there's a reason why he is probably the number one T20 spinner in the world. So we'll have to see what we can do,"" said de Kock on his former Kolkata Knight Riders teammate.Varun has an economy of 5.16, Bumrah is going at just 6 an over, Axar Patel is at 6.63, Kuldeep and Arshdeep at 4.66 and 7.60 respectively. Even the all-rounders Pandya and Dube have maintained control with an economy of 7.92 and 8.62 each. There are no freebies or releases on offer and it will take more than one bad day for this bowling unit to mess up a fixture. When serious business begins with the Super 8, the unsung bowlers will start hogging most of the limelight because they are the most crucial piece of the puzzle.","India have the most dangerous and well-rounded attack in the tournament.

India, left-handers and off-spin: Why hosts need to be very worried

Ahmedabad: Quinton de Kock turned up for the pre-match press conference with don’t-care attitude. The answers were curt, bordering on being dismissive. This is a new De Kock, back in international cricket two months ago after a hiatus of 18 months since the loss to India in the T20 World Cup final in 2024.In a way, de Kock depicts a resurgent South African cricket culture over the last two years. They have shed the chokers’ tag by lifting the World Test Championship title last year. “We haven’t spoken about that T20 final after the game. We went back to our homes and dealt with it in our own ways. I don’t know if the others have spoken about it when I wasn’t around. But I haven’t since I rejoined the team,” was De Kock’s curt response to the mention of the 2024 final.Has winning the WTC helped them move on from being called chokers? “I wasn’t part of it. I didn’t even watch the match because I was in USA playing a league and they don’t have these matches on TV there. Again, there has been no discussion about it either since I joined,” claimed the wicketkeeper.South African cricket has often been criticized for complicating things. Under Aiden Markram , the chief architect of that WTC final win against Australia at Lord’s last June, they have assumed a different approach.Markram, to start with himself, has found clarity as a T20 batter while opening the batting. De Kock, India’s nemesis since the start of his career in 2013, has just clicked with Markram joining at the top of the order. “We never used to open. Aiden had different situations all the time, so he always had to adapt. An opening batter has pretty much one sort of thing to do. That's also easier for him to deal with. Probably, he has had the clarity that he's had as an opener,” De Kock reckoned.It's clear that this South African team doesn’t want to dwell in the past. De Kock doesn’t even want to talk about his ominous record against India. He just dismisses it as playing on good surfaces. This team has found momentum and rearing to challenge India’s title as T20 World champions.",South Africa face India in the T20 World Cup final in 2024.

T20 World Cup: Suryakumar Yadav press conference ahead of India vs South Africa

India captain Suryakumar Yadav on Saturday defended Tilak Varma despite his modest returns in the T20 World Cup league stage, saying the batter is following instructions given by the team management.Tilak’s strike rate, which is above 141 in his career, has dropped to the 120s in this tournament. He has struggled against slow bowlers on surfaces where the ball has gripped more. Across four matches, he has managed only 11 boundaries and three sixes and has not been able to shift gears after settling in.The India captain said Tilak’s approach is part of a defined role.""I mean I have told him, the team management has told him that he has to bat that way. If one wicket is down, then he is definitely, he can go and have his own game in the powerplay,"" Surya said.""But as soon as two wickets are down, then he has to take a little bit of backseat, get a partnership again, get to the 10th over and then we have enough firepower to continue and take on the bowling,"" the Indian skipper explained the rationale behind the approach although it wasn't exactly convincing.He added that Tilak himself would expect more from his performances.""Definitely, I am sure he must not be happy with how he is batting right now, I am sure. He must be and he has practiced a lot as well in the last 2-3 practice sessions. But I don't have any concern regarding him. He has been delivering for India at No. 3 really well and I am very confident that he will do it better.""Suryakumar dismissed talk of replacing Tilak with Sanju Samson ""You mean, I should make him (Samson) play for Tilak?"" he laughed.He said India’s scoring in the powerplay has been normal but expectations remain high.""It's going well in powerplay. We're making 40-50 runs. That's normal cricket. Now we've played so well in bilaterals. It happens. We also have expectations of ourselves. Expectation to make 220, 240, 250,"" he said.""But wickets are a little different here (in the World Cup). The four wickets we have played on so far were a little different and challenging. Off-spinners were not bowling earlier but are bowling now. So we have started preparation for that and hopefully we will tackle it as we start our Super 8 journey.""The captain said he is confident in the bowling unit, especially when defending totals around 175 to 180.""I do take a lot of pride in my bowling unit. I know that on a given day, if we ever make 170, 175, or 180 because of the high risk, high reward game we are trying to play, then we have a good bowling attack which can save the match, it can win that game,"" he said.""Look, I never thought that this team will make scores like 250, 270, 220, 230. But the way we're playing cricket now, you'll see in the future, if you see a start, then after that, everyone bats with the same template. But the day you don't get a start, that day you have to think about what the team needs.""",Tilak's strike rate has dropped to the 120s in this tournament.

Jay Shah’s 2036 Olympic blueprint for India: '8 Medals won’t cut it'

Pakistan hockey captain Ammad Shakeel Butt criticised Pakistan Hockey Federation after troubled Australia tour during which his side didn't just have to roam the streets for lack of accommodation but also ""wash dishes before going to play a match"".Speaking to reporters at Lahore Airport, early this morning that the Pakistan Hockey Federation had been telling them lies and ""enough was enough"".""We can't work with this current management of the federation. When players have to clean the kitchen and wash dishes before going to play a match what result do you expect from us?"" a livid Butt asked angrily.Butt said the players faced serious problems during the trip. He claimed the federation did not properly arrange accommodation for the team. According to him, the players had to wait 13 to 14 hours at Sydney Airport before flying to Canberra.When the team arrived at their hotel, they were told that no advance payment had been made, so there were no confirmed bookings. The players had to wait for hours and even walk around the streets before a place to stay was arranged. Pakistan lost 2-3 to Australia in their first FIH Pro League match and went on to lose all their matches during the Australia leg, including games against Australia and Germany.Butt said the situation was embarrassing and affected the team’s performance.""What was pathetic was that even the Airbnb accommodation was arranged for 10 days when we had to stay for 13 days.

India

Netherlands

A dominant India will be hoping that Abhishek Sharma rediscovers his destructive form and that the rest of the batting lineup steps up against spin when they take on the Netherlands in their final T20 World Cup league match on Wednesday. Despite being one of the most dangerous batters over the past 18 months, Abhishek has yet to make a big impact in the ICC event at home.After a duck in the opener, a stomach infection kept him out against Namibia. He returned for the high-stakes clash with Pakistan but again failed to score.Thankfully, Ishan Kishan’s imperious form at the other end has kept India’s campaign on track. To his credit, Abhishek’s high-risk approach has delivered multiple wins for India, and it may only be a matter of time before he dismantles top bowlers again. Yet, four ducks in his last six innings indicate he might need to rethink his powerplay strategy.With India already through to the Super 8s, the Netherlands game offers the perfect chance to get back among the runs. On the bowling front, India could rest a few players ahead of the next stage, including pace spearhead Jasprit Bumrah. After opting for Kuldeep Yadav over Arshdeep Singh in Colombo, the team is expected to revert to two specialist pacers.If Bumrah is rested, Mohammed Siraj and Arshdeep Singh are likely to open the attack.The India vs Netherlands match will be played on Wednesday, February 18.The match will be played at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad.The match will start at 7:00 PM IST, with the toss scheduled for 6:30 PM IST.The match will be televised live in India on the Star Sports Network.Live streaming will be available on the Jio Hotstar app and website.The match can be followed live on TimesofIndia.com.- Probable XI: Abhishek Sharma, Ishan Kishan, Tilak Varma, Suryakumar Yadav, Rinku Singh, Hardik Pandya, Shivam Dube, Axar Patel, Arshdeep Singh, Jasprit Bumrah, Varun Chakarvarthy- Probable XI: Michael Levitt, Max O'Dowd, Bas de Leede, Colin Ackermann, Scott Edwards, Zach Lion-Cachet, Roelof van der Merwe, Logan van Beek, Aryan Dutt, Paul van Meekeren, Fred Klaasen: Suryakumar Yadav (c), Abhishek Sharma, Tilak Varma, Sanju Samson, Shivam Dube, Ishan Kishan, Hardik Pandya, Arshdeep Singh, Jasprit Bumrah, Mohammed Siraj, Varun Chakaravarthy, Kuldeep Yadav, Axar Patel, Washington Sundar, Rinku Singh.: Scott Edwards (c), Colin Ackermann, Noah Croes, Bas de Leede, Aryan Dutt, Fred Klaassen, Kyle Klein, Michael Levitt, Zach Lion-Cachet, Max O'Dowd, Logan van Beek, Timm van der Gugten, Roelof van der Merwe, Paul van Meekeren, Saqib Zulfiqar.","India take on the Netherlands in their final T20 World Cup league match on Wednesday.

Heavy rain forecast in Sri Lanka | Pakistan T20 World Cup dream over?

How challenging was the role when you took over?

Has red ball cricket given you a second chance as well?

Going into the final, what has been your conversation with the players?

Can you take us through the rise of Nabi?

What makes this team tick?

BENGALURU: A conversation with Jammu and Kashmir head coach Ajay Sharma feels like listening to a gripping film script — complete with a stirring storyline, powerful performances and punchlines. And redemption.The 61-year-old former India batter, who took charge ahead of the 2022-23 season, describes his journey with the J&K side as a rebirth. It is a sentiment rooted in experience. His playing career was derailed by matchfixing allegations, charges from which he was cleared by the judiciary, forcing him to rebuild his life and reputation from scratch. Now, as a coach, Sharma has scripted a remarkable resurgence. He has instilled culture, belief and a winning mindset into a side that has defied expectations.With Jammu and Kashmir set to face eight-time champions Karnataka in their maiden Ranji Trophy final in Hubballi starting on Tuesday, Sharma spoke to TOI about the team’s rise, the hardships, and the hunger that fuels their campaign. ExcerptsThe first year was tough. Back then, their mindset was different.They only wanted to play in the IPL and hadn’t developed the temperament for red-ball cricket. Irrespective of the format, the batters would step out to hit from the first ball. I was furious, and it took me some time to understand them. I started believing that if these players are groomed mentally, their mindset would change and that’s what happened. But it was anything but easy. The first year, they did not warm up to me. Their attitude towards me was like: ‘Boriya bistar bandh ke niklo.’ In fact, I asked them to write a review at the end of my first season, and 13 players wrote that they didn’t like being coached by me. I changed myself from being a strict coach to going down to their level, communicating and understanding them. This team has stuck together since then.Absolutely. It’s my second birth after I went through a lot of difficulties in life. When Mithun Manhas called me four years ago and asked me to take over, I wasn’t sure because nobody really gave the J&K team much thought. Many friends from across the world, with whom I had lost touch for years, have been calling me and telling me that they are proud of my work and are rooting for the team to win the championship. That’s how much life has changed.My message to them is clear. We play the game, not the opposition. We are going out there to win. Just focus on the process and the result will take care of itself. A title win can change their fortunes. I’ve told them this could open doors — India call-ups, India A opportunities, even IPL contracts. I’ve told them to remember, a champion team can beat a team of champions. Whether you are a batter or a bowler, red-ball cricket always gives you a second chance. That’s the lesson we learnt in the semifinal against Bengal — even after conceding the 1st-innings lead, we found a way back.I haven’t seen a bowler like him in my life. He is like a horse. He is so focused and hardworking that selection is hardly on his mind. So he’s reaping the rewards now with the domestic performance of the IPL contract. It’s not that easy for him to play. Auqib Nabi is a lot like Mohd Shami; what he lacks in speed, he makes up for in skill. Also, speed is not the only weapon you need. Whether we are playing on a pata wicket, green top or a turner, his mindset remains the same. He concentrates on bowling in the right areas and taking wickets. That is what has made him one of the most feared bowlers in the domestic circuit.The journey and the struggles of these boys are extraordinary. Given the circumstances in the region, they’ve faced challenges from a very young age. Most of our players come from districts with hardly any facilities, but things have changed for the better now. One example is pacer Sunil Kumar, who has been outstanding this season. He came through a talent hunt programme. This is a boy who once struggled to afford two square meals a day, and today, after Nabi, he is the backbone of our team. That hunger drives them. For us, only performance matters — not reputation or names. That’s why you don’t see Umran Malik in the team.","Jammu and Kashmir set to face eight-time champions Karnataka in their maiden Ranji Trophy final in Hubballi starting on Tuesday.

NEW DELHI: A riveting contest between two quality spin attacks awaits as England aim to take confidence from their recent 3-0 T20I series sweep over Sri Lanka when the sides meet in a Super Eight clash on Saturday.England dominated Sri Lanka earlier this month on these shores and will welcome a return to the island after playing their group-stage matches in India. However, the two-time champions have flattered to deceive so far, scraping past associate teams and suffering a defeat to West Indies.Sri Lanka, meanwhile, opened with victories against Ireland and Oman and produced a commanding chase to beat Australia by eight wickets. But a setback against Zimbabwe in their final group fixture stalled their momentum.With the Super Eight stage offering a reset, Sri Lanka will hope to maximise home conditions, while England look to rediscover rhythm at a venue where they recently thrived.The England vs Sri Lanka match will be played on Sunday, February 22.The match will be played at the Pallekele International Cricket Stadium in Pallekele.The match will start at 3:00 PM IST, with the toss scheduled for 2:30 PM IST.The match will be televised live in India on the Star Sports Network.Live streaming will be available on the Jio Hotstar app and website.The match can be followed live on TimesofIndia.com.Reports suggest that Pallekele could see spells of light to heavy rain on Sunday (February 22), casting uncertainty over the England vs Sri Lanka T20 World Cup 2026 encounter.Weather forecasts also indicate roughly a 20 per cent likelihood of thunderstorms, further raising concerns about potential interruptions during the match.The Pallekele International Cricket Stadium typically offers a batting-friendly surface early in the game, with true bounce and pace allowing stroke-makers to play their shots freely. However, as the match progresses, the pitch tends to slow down and assist spinners, bringing them increasingly into play. The highest total at the vebue is 263/3 by Australia against Sri Lanka in 2016.Sri Lanka (Playing XI): Pathum Nissanka, Kusal Perera, Kusal Mendis(w), Pavan Rathnayake, Dasun Shanaka(c), Kamindu Mendis, Dunith Wellalage, Dushan Hemantha, Maheesh Theekshana, Dilshan Madushanka, Pramod MadushanEngland (Playing XI): Philip Salt, Jos Buttler(w), Jacob Bethell, Tom Banton, Harry Brook(c), Sam Curran, Will Jacks, Jamie Overton, Liam Dawson, Jofra Archer, Adil RashidEngland: Harry Brook (c), Tom Banton, Jos Buttler, Ben Duckett, Phil Salt, Jacob Bethell, Sam Curran, Liam Dawson, Will Jacks, Jamie Overton, Rehan Ahmed, Jofra Archer, Adil Rashid, Josh Tongue, Luke Wood.Sri Lanka: Kusal Mendis, Kamil Mishara, Pathum Nissanka, Kusal Perera, Pavan Rathnayake, Dasun Shanaka (c), Charith Asalanka, Dushan Hemantha, Janith Liyanage, Kamindu Mendis, Dushmantha Chameera, Dilshan Madushanka, Pramod Madushan, Maheesh Theekshana, Dunith Wellalage.","England vs Sri Lanka T20 World Cup 2026 match to be played on February 22.

Is there a reserve day?

The Super Eight clash between Pakistan and New Zealand in the Twenty20 World Cup was washed out without a ball being bowled after heavy rain in Colombo on Saturday.Persistent drizzle right after the toss -- which Pakistan won and opted to bat -- at the Premadasa stadium did not relent with umpires finally calling the match off at 9:05pm local time (15:35 GMT).Not even a five-over match was possible by the 10:16 pm (1646 GMT) cut-off time, giving the two teams one point each.Pakistan, New Zealand, England and co-hosts Sri Lanka are in Group 2 of the Super Eights.Earlier, Pakistan captain Salman Ali Agha won the toss and chose to bat against the side led by Mitchell Santner, but heavy rain delayed play.Both New Zealand and Pakistan qualified for the Super 8 stage after winning three out of their four T20 World Cup 2026 group-stage matches, respectively.While New Zealand registered wins against Afghanistan, UAE and Canada, Pakistan clinched victories against USA, Netherlands and Namibia. New Zealand's sole loss came against the T20 WC 2024 runners-up South Africa while Pakistan lost to the defending champions and arch-rivals India.There is no reserve day for this Super 8 fixture. Both teams will now share one point each — a scenario that could severely dent their semi-final hopes.This means the Super Eight phase begins without a ball bowled in the opening fixture. The decision was confirmed after conditions did not improve enough to allow a start. Both sides will share one point each, which could affect their chances of reaching the semi-finals.It is a disappointing development for both teams, and fans.","Pakistan and New Zealand's Super 8 clash washed out after heavy rain in Colombo.

NEW DELHI: Rain completely washed out the Pakistan vs New Zealand T20 World Cup 2026 Super 8 match in Colombo on Saturday, leaving fans disappointed and the points table wide open. The abandoned match means both teams share one point, which has made the semi-final race more complicated.This match was important for both teams to get a strong start in the Super 8 stage. Instead, Pakistan and New Zealand now have two matches left to secure a place in the semi-finals.For Pakistan, the path is clear but challenging. They will face England and Sri Lanka next.If Pakistan win both matches, they will reach five points, which should be enough to qualify for the semi-finals.However, if they lose even one game, their qualification chances will depend on other results.If Pakistan win one match and lose one, they will finish with three points and will need other teams to drop points.If they lose both matches, Pakistan will be knocked out of the tournament.New Zealand are in a similar situation. The washout gives them one point, but they will also need victories in their remaining matches to stay in control.Any slip-up could drag them into a tight points race.Since this was the first Super 8 match for both teams, the group standings will become clearer once all teams have played at least one game.Both Pakistan and New Zealand were considered favourites, but the rain has made their road to the semi-finals more difficult.","Rain completely washed out the Pakistan vs New Zealand T20 World Cup 2026 Super 8 match in Colombo on Saturday.

Rain threat adds uncertainty ahead of Pakistan-New Zealand encounter

Rain has become the main talking point ahead of the Pakistan vs New Zealand T20 World Cup 2026 Super 8 match in Colombo, with the weather threatening to disrupt the big clash on Saturday. Light but steady drizzle has covered the ground, and the start of the match has already been delayed.Officials have kept the pitch and outfield under covers, and fans are waiting for updates on when play can begin.If the rain does not stop, overs will start getting cut after 8:10 PM IST (2:40 PM GMT). That means the match could be shortened, depending on how long the delay lasts.The latest possible time to start a five-overs-per-side game is 10:16 PM IST (4.46 pm GMT).If play cannot begin by then, the match could be abandoned with no result, which would be a big blow for both teams.Rain in Colombo is not new, and similar conditions forced Pakistan to cancel a practice session recently. Even today, the drizzle has been persistent, and the forecast does not look very promising. Fans and teams are hoping for a break in the weather so that at least some cricket can be played.Pakistan have won the toss and elected to bat first. There are also some interesting team updates.Pakistan have brought back Fakhar Zaman despite concerns over his knee, which surprised many.It will be interesting to see where he bats in the order and what role Babar Azam plays in the lineup.New Zealand have also made changes, with captain Mitchell Santner returning and fast bowler Lockie Ferguson rejoining the squad after becoming a father.Both teams reached the Super 8 stage with strong performances in the group stage, so this match is important for their World Cup campaign.

It was his fifth goal in four games, showing his strong recent form under coach Alvaro Arbeloa, who replaced Xabi Alonso in January.Kylian Mbappe thought he had scored, but his goal was ruled out for offside. Madrid seemed distracted, possibly thinking about their upcoming Champions League match against Benfica, coached by Jose Mourinho.Coach Arbeloa admitted his team did not play well and said they need to improve before their important European match.""It was not a good game from us... we have to play a lot better,"" Arbeloa told reporters.""We had control at some points but we lacked speed in our play... on Wednesday we have another final, another game that is very important for us.""Real Madrid could have taken the lead late in their La Liga game, but Kylian Mbappe’s shot was blocked by Javi Galan.

Sorloth then scored his second to make it 4-1 before Edu Exposito netted a late consolation for Espanyol.Although Atletico trail Real Madrid by 12 points and are out of the title race, the win strengthens their hold on a top-four finish.""We needed to get the points to close in on the teams above us,"" said Simeone.""We were protagonists, we scored four goals, we had two or three more clear chances, we played a very complete game.""Atletico now prepare to host Club Brugge in a crucial Champions League play-off second leg on Tuesday, after a 3-3 first-leg draw in Belgium.",Real Madrid lose 2-1 away to Osasuna in La Liga.

Manchester City boosted their Premier League title hopes with an important 2–1 win over Newcastle United on Saturday.Nico O’Reilly scored twice at the Etihad Stadium. He gave City the lead in the first half, and after Lewis Hall equalised for Newcastle, O’Reilly scored again to secure the victory.City were not at their best, but they did enough to win. The result moves them within two points of league leaders Arsenal.Arsenal travel to Tottenham on Sunday, but no matter what happens in that match, City are in control of the title race. They will have a game in hand after this weekend and will host Arsenal in April. If City win their remaining 11 matches, they will guarantee another league title under Pep Guardiola.Guardiola had said on Friday that he “couldn’t care less” about Arsenal’s recent slip in form. Arsenal have won only two of their last seven league games, while City are improving at the right time.The win over Newcastle was City’s fifth in a row in all competitions and extended their unbeaten run to eight matches.It was already the fourth time the two teams have met this season, with a fifth meeting set for next month in the FA Cup last 16.Newcastle have still never won a Premier League game at the Etihad Stadium, losing 20 times there. They also lost at City in the League Cup semi-finals this season.After travelling 5,000 miles to Baku for their Champions League play-off match against Qarabag on Wednesday, Newcastle were very tired. Because of the long trip, they asked the Premier League to move their game in Manchester from an early kick-off to Saturday evening.City started the game fast, trying to take advantage of Newcastle being tired.They scored in the 14th minute. Erling Haaland passed the ball to Omar Marmoush, who then set up O’Reilly. O’Reilly shot from the edge of the box and beat Nick Pope.Newcastle almost scored right away. Anthony Gordon took a strong shot, but goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma saved it.City’s defence made mistakes, and in the 22nd minute Newcastle scored. City failed to clear the ball from a corner. Lewis Hall shot from outside the box, and the ball hit Rayan Ait-Nouri and went into the net.City scored again five minutes later. Haaland crossed the ball into the box, and O’Reilly headed it in for his second goal.In the second half, Hall nearly scored again, but his shot went just wide.City’s manager Pep Guardiola was unhappy because his team could not score another goal, urging his players to ""keep the ball better"" as he stalked the touchline. Antoine Semenyo also missed a good chance.In the end, City held on and won the match.","Manchester City beat Newcastle United 2-1 at the Etihad Stadium.

KOCHI: Preparations for Kerala Blasters ’ first home match of the new Indian Super League (ISL) season against Mumbai City FC were thrown into turmoil on the eve of the fixture on Saturday, following an unexpected standoff with the Greater Cochin Development Authority (GCDA), which owns the Jawaharlal Nehru International Stadium in Kochi.GCDA denied permission for a pre-arranged pre-match press conference to be held inside the stadium, forcing the club to shift the interaction online at short notice.Tensions escalated later in the evening when GCDA officials reportedly asked All India Football Federation (AIFF) personnel, including match commissioner Arunava Bhattacharya, to vacate the premises. The authority also allegedly ordered the closure of the club’s administrative office operating within the stadium complex.Amid speculation that the match could be called off, the Blasters clarified in a late evening statement that the game would proceed as per schedule. “In the end, football is the winner. We will take to the field against Mumbai City FC tomorrow for our first home game of the season,” the club said.However, a source close to the management indicated that the understanding applies only for the opening fixture, with no clarity yet on arrangements for the remaining home games.The uncertainty stems from a dispute over stadium rent and pending payments.Last week, GCDA chairman K Chandran Pillai announced in a joint press conference with club officials that Rs 2 lakh would be charged as a one-time concession for this season, instead of Rs 8 lakh that was charged during the previous seasons.However, the authority’s executive committee, which met on Thursday, reportedly reversed the decision and fixed the rent at Rs 4.2 lakh per match.In addition to the revised match-day rent, GCDA is said to have demanded that the Blasters clear the full amount and settle an additional Rs 22 lakh as liability fees from the previous season within a week.According to a source within the club, the disputed sum relates to losses and additional expenses arising from a Bharatanatyam event held at the stadium in December last year.“Since the event happened in the middle of the season, they are asking us to pay that amount. Why should we pay the liability for an event that had no connection with us?” the source said.TOI reached out to GCDA officials, but they were not available for comment.The standoff played out publicly earlier in the day when GCDA security personnel asked journalists to vacate the hall designated for the pre-match press conference before locking up the venue. Blasters head coach David Catala and midfielder Rowllin Borges reportedly waited for over 30 minutes before leaving, once it became clear the interaction would not be allowed to proceed.The club subsequently conducted the media briefing online. During the session, Catala was asked pointedly by a reporter: “Which is your home ground?”The Spaniard kept his focus on football. His priority, he said, was preparing the squad and playing in front of their supporters at the stadium. He exuded confidence that the match would go ahead at the venue despite the uncertainty off the pitch.For now, the Blasters’ home opener will go ahead as per schedule, but the dispute on rent remains unresolved, casting a shadow over the rest of their ISL campaign.","The Greater Cochin Development Authority (GCDA) owns the Jawaharlal Nehru International Stadium in Kochi.

(AP)

LONDON: Pep Guardiola insists he ""couldn't care less"" about Arsenal's stumble letting Manchester City back into the Premier League title race.Guardiola's side were in danger of being blown away by Arsenal after their inconsistent form left the Gunners in pole position.But second-placed City have been handed a lifeline by Arsenal's damaging draws against Wolves and Brentford.They are now just five points behind Arsenal with a game in hand and a home match against Mikel Arteta's men to come in April.If City win their remaining 12 matches they will be crowned champions for the fifth time in the last six seasons.But Guardiola is not getting carried away by the opportunity.Instead, he remains focused on Saturday's visit from Newcastle, when a win would close the gap on Arsenal to two points before the Gunners face Tottenham in the north London derby on Sunday.""I didn't talk about the table, or our position or something like that. I could not care less,"" Guardiola told reporters on Friday.""I didn't talk about that for one second. Just Newcastle, Newcastle, Newcastle.""If you ask me this question with two or three games left, I will have your answer. It's 12 games left, it's an eternity.""Having won six titles during 10 years at City, Guardiola knows the final weeks of the season will bring more twists and turns.He also has experience of watching Arsenal let substantial leads slip away in the 2023 and 2024 title races, allowing City to snatch the trophy from their grasp.""Many things are going to happen until the end of the season. For now it is Newcastle, a rest and after it Leeds. It has always been like that,"" he said.""Seventy per cent of the players are new, so they don't have the experience to live these kinds of situations. An experience is to win tomorrow. It is only one.""Arsenal were nine points (ahead) when we had a game in hand, so whenever everybody is on the same games played then after that we will see the difference.""I understand you want to anticipate what is going to happen. That doesn't count. It is Newcastle, that is all.""Meanwhile, Guardiola said racism remains a problem for society to cure rather than just football.Real Madrid star Vinicius Junior claimed he was racially abused by Benfica winger Gianluca Prestianni during a Champions League tie this week.The match was paused in line with UEFA regulations after Vinicius alleged he was abused after celebrating scoring.""There is a lot of work still to do. It is in the society, it is not just in football. Racism is everywhere,"" Guardiola said.""You pretend that racism is just for the colour of the skin?

Why is Ahmedabad likely to be the sporting capital of India? | Bombay Sport Exchange

On the eve of NorthEast United FC ’s Indian Super League (ISL) opener against East Bengal FC, head coach Juan Pedro Benali struck a deeply emotional yet clear-headed note, calling on fans to rally behind their teams while keeping the bigger picture of Indian football in mind.“It’s easy to criticise on social media. Buy the tickets to watch your team, be it NorthEast United FC, East Bengal FC or Kerala Blasters FC, make people feel that football is important,” he said, before adding, “Rather than sitting at home and criticising, not watching the games, come to the stadiums.”The 56-year-old Spaniard emphasised that even small acts of support can make a meaningful difference, urging fans to go the extra mile for their clubs and the sport.“We know it is a difficult moment, but support your team. Just for that Rs 100, Rs 200 or Rs 50 (match ticket price), it’s money. The sacrifice that you make by travelling to watch the game, be it 10, 20, 50, or 80 km, is a sacrifice. But when you make that sacrifice, you earn the right to criticise, and you can say, I helped my club,” Benali added.While acknowledging the frustrations surrounding Indian football, Benali made it clear that fans are fully entitled to express their views — but insisted that criticism should be matched with action.“The national team is not doing well, because of this, that… I understand. It’s your right (to voice your opinion). Do it, but also help. Rs 200 for each game. Go to the FanCode, pay Rs 299 for the season pass. Buy the subscription to watch NorthEast United FC (Team Pass). That’s what we’re asking from the fans. That’s the support. That’s the help. This is where the clubs can feel that they have (supporting) hands, and not the fans who only talk,” he said.In a call for unity during what he described as a challenging phase, Benali urged supporters to stand by their teams regardless of results or circumstances.“It is not a moment to say NorthEast will not do well or go to the second division. No, it is a moment to be with everyone, regardless of the results. Be with your team, your players,” he added.He signed off with a broader appeal, urging the entire Indian football ecosystem to come together as one.“This is the real moment to be a family. This is the real moment to be an Indian football family, all together. The clubs, the players, the fans. This is the moment to show the world that even if 10 per cent of the Indian population loves football, that’s 150 million people.

The military will use two types of equipment:

A semi-mobile system that creates a protected zone where no unauthorized drone can fly.

A portable system that a soldier can carry and point at a suspicious drone.

The Mexican military is getting ready to deal with unauthorized drones during this summer’s football World Cup.Mexico is hosting the tournament together with the United States and Canada from June 11 to July 19. On Tuesday, soldiers at a military base in Mexico City showed the anti-drone equipment they plan to use to protect stadiums.The move comes because drug cartels in Mexico have increasingly used drones bought online to attack rivals and sometimes civilians. This has become more common over the past five years.However, most of the cartel violence happens far from the three World Cup host cities: Mexico City, Guadalajara, and Monterrey. These cities will host 13 matches during the tournament.""(Drone prevention) is going to be focused in the stadiums and where there are crowds, which could be the 'Fan Fest' events, or any point where there are meetings of people,"" army Captain Jose Alfredo Lara, a communications and electronics engineer, told AFP.Once the military team locates a drone, it cuts off the pilot's communication with the apparatus. ""The device loses control and won't be able to come close,"" Lara explained.This causes the drone to lose control and prevents it from getting close. Depending on how it is set up, the drone may return to its operator, try to leave the blocked area, or crash.Several major criminal groups in Mexico, including the Sinaloa Cartel, Cartel Jalisco Nueva Generacion, and La Familia Michoacana, are known to use drones. Their activity is mostly reported in states like Michoacan, Chihuahua, and Guanajuato.Last October, drones carrying homemade explosives attacked state prosecutor offices in Tijuana, a city near the US border.The Mexican military says these new security measures are meant to reduce the risk of drone attacks during the World Cup and keep fans safe.",Mexico is hosting the tournament together with the United States and Canada from June 11 to July 19.

The game was stopped for several minutes, and Vinicius was later booed by the crowd.Benfica coach Jose Mourinho was sent off late in the game for protesting too strongly. This means he will miss the second leg in Madrid.

Jason Dunn calls for justice for NFL players who endured football’s most violent era

Former Kansas City Chiefs tight end Jason Dunn has sparked a serious debate about the NFL ’s past safety issues. On Feb. 21, 2026, he reacted to a resurfaced 1977 CBS NFL intro clip and called for financial justice for players from that brutal era.Dunn believes many former players suffered life-changing injuries before strict safety rules existed. He says the league must step up and compensate those men appropriately.Jason Dunn shared his thoughts on X on February 21, 2026. After watching the vintage broadcast, he wrote, “Yes indeedy!!! I remember seeing some of those gladiators coming in the locker room or practice from having hip surgery or mangled fingers, real dudes… Glad they changed the game for the safety of the players… Every single one of those men needs to compensated appropriately!”His words hit differently as it refelect the concerns regarding past NFL safety rules. Dunn entered the NFL in 1996 as a fourth-round pick of the Philadelphia Eagles. In 1999, he suffered a season-ending knee injury and missed the entire year. He later joined Kansas City in 2000 and stayed until his retirement after the 2007 season. Injuries cost players games, contracts, and sometimes long-term health.Football in the 1970s carried far fewer protections. Defenders dragged runners by the helmet. Hits came high and late.Concussions rarely drew attention. The league began serious reforms in the early 2000s. Since 2002, the NFL has introduced more than 50 safety-related rule changes. It strengthened defenseless receiver protections, adjusted roughing the passer rules, expanded concussion protocols, and in recent years required guardian caps during certain practices.Dunn’s point is simple. Today’s players benefit from safer conditions and better medical care. Many former players did not. The NFL agreed to a concussion settlement with retired players in 2013, yet debates over fairness continue.His comments come as Kansas City also waits for clarity from star tight end Travis Kelce, who has been in the news amid his uncertain future. On Feb. 20, 2026, head coach Andy Reid said via Zoom, “There is communication. As long as there’s communication, I’m good.” Reid sounded hopeful about Kelce’s future.Still, Dunn’s message stands on its own. The league celebrates toughness from past decades. He believes it should also acknowledge the cost and compensate the men who paid it.","Former Kansas City Chiefs tight end Jason Dunn has sparked a serious debate about the NFL ’s past safety issues.

Chloe Kim shares the simple rule she and Myles Garrett follow to stay connected

Olympic champion Chloe Kim and Myles Garrett might be in completely different fields, but their unity seems based on simple, as opposed to spectacular. Although they both are world sports people who have busy timetables and are under constant scrutiny, the couple has secretly managed to create a culture that focuses on peaceful living rather than mayhem. Kim has just provided a glimpse into their personal life, which shows how they balance their life despite the high-pressure professions.During a recent interview with People, the two-time Olympic gold medalist talked about her time at the 2026 Winter Olympics and what life is like when she's not competing. Instead of spotlighting fame or accolades, she highlighted a rule that helps preserve their connection and protect their downtime together.During the interview, Kim explained the couple’s approach to protecting their personal space from professional stress. “We don’t really talk about our jobs. Getting a break from work and just enjoying each other’s company is nice,"" she said.With Garrett in the NFL offseason and Kim wrapping up a demanding Olympic run that earned her a silver medal in Italy, the timing has allowed them to slow down and reconnect. She told me that she is looking forward to rest and spending time together in silence due to months of extreme concentration and traveling.Another aspect Kim thought about in her reflection was the opportunity to celebrate her Olympic success with people she loves and she said that this moment is something she could not forget. The fact that her family and Garrett were both enjoying the win made it even more worthwhile. The celebrations stayed low-key, including dinner, a toast, and time spent playing video games with her mother.Garrett, known for his dominance on the field with the Cleveland Browns, has shown a softer side off it. In a recent interview, he revealed a heartfelt poem he wrote for Kim:""You enrapture fools to kings, and exist without a peer. Put on this Earth for many things, but our love is why you're here."" Kim admitted the gesture moved her deeply. “It's sweet; it's so sweet, I cried.""Their relationship does not work based on the show but on considerate moments, compliment, and time together. Living in a world of nonstop sound, Garrett and Kim appear to have learned that the best relationships are usually constructed without saying a word.","Olympic snowboarder Chloe Kim recently offered a rare look into her life with NFL star Myles Garrett.

Kayla Nicole opens up about Travis Kelce breakup, admits love was strong but timing wasn’t right

Travis Kelce's Ex Kayla Nicole Seemingly SHADES Taylor Swift in Super Bowl Commercial

Kayla Nicole is speaking again, and this time her words carry the calm distance of someone who has had time to sit with the past. The sports journalist, once closely linked with Travis Kelce , offered a rare and thoughtful look into her last relationship. Years removed from their breakup, she did not sound bitter. If anything, she sounded reflective. Yet her timing has drawn attention, especially now that Kelce’s life has moved into a very public new chapter with Taylor Swift Their relationship, which unfolded between 2017 and 2022, never fully faded from public memory. It resurfaced in jokes, Halloween costumes, and even commercials. Nicole has learned to live with that link. But in a recent candid moment, she spoke less about headlines and more about the quiet, personal reality of why things sometimes fall apart.Kayla Nicole’s most direct remarks came during a TikTok live chat with Ace Greene from Love Island. When asked about her last serious relationship, she answered simply, “Probably, like, three years ago now. It’s been a long time.” The timeline matched the end of her on and off romance with Kelce, who plays for the Kansas City Chiefs.Pressed on why it ended, she did not point fingers. “Who knows,” she answered. “[It] could be compatibility issues,” Nicole said, adding that it could’ve also been the case of “right person, wrong time.”It was not the first time she had leaned into humor while carrying that history. Earlier, in a Super Bowl commercial for the Sleeper app, she joked about trying to “put an end to this whole ‘ex-girlfriend’ fiasco quickly,” prompting co star Ben Simmons to reply, “I said swiftly.” The wordplay did not go unnoticed. Neither did the reactions online.Still, Nicole’s recent comments felt less playful and more honest. When the conversation turned to dating today, her tone mixed humor with realism. “I feel like the bar is in hell,” Nicole answered. She added one practical requirement that now tops her list. “My new list of requirements is having a job — that’s at the top of the list.”Her perspective reflects someone who has stepped out of a defining chapter and into her own space. The two first connected through social media, with Kelce showing interest long before they met. What followed was a five year stretch filled with highs, pauses, and eventual closure.Kelce’s story has since taken a different turn. His relationship with Swift grew after their eventual connection, a story they later shared on the New Heights podcast. Meanwhile, Nicole has chosen to speak only when she feels ready, and only in her own way. Her recent words did not reopen old wounds. They simply acknowledged that sometimes, even meaningful relationships reach their natural end.","Kayla Nicole and Travis Kelce split three years ago.

Bündchen has embraced a quieter, private life focused on family and nature, while Brady enjoys a busy social and media career. Despite limited communication and separate worlds, insiders say they maintain a stable co-parenting arrangement centered on their children’s well-being.

Tom Brady and Gisele Bündchen embrace separate lives while making co-parenting work

Tom Brady and Gisele Bundchen have moved on with their lives since their very public breakup. The distance between them now shows that they are on two very different paths. They are still working together to raise their kids, but their daily lives don't often overlap. The former NFL star is enjoying a busy social and work life, while the supermodel has found a quieter rhythm that focuses on family, nature, and privacy.Their main goal is still to give people structure and emotional safety. Both parents seem determined to make the situation work for their kids, even though they live in different homes, have different routines, and have different relationships.Sources close to Gisele Bündchen describe her current lifestyle as intentional and deeply fulfilling. “Gisele’s life now is much more private. It’s more in line with who she is. It’s a life she dreamed of.” Another insider added, “She always envisioned this slower-paced lifestyle for herself and her children, surrounded by nature and removed from ‘the business.’ She’s at peace.”She divides her time between Miami, Brazil, and Costa Rica while raising her young son with husband Joaquim Valente. Friends say the shift reflects a long-held desire to step away from the relentless pace of fame and create a grounded environment for her family.Tom Brady, meanwhile, appears energized by his post-retirement chapter. He has been seen socializing with celebrities and continues his work as a Fox Sports commentator. A source close to him said, “Tom is genuinely enjoying this chapter. He sees himself as a single dad who finally has some freedom and is enjoying his life without overthinking it.”Communication between the exes remains focused and purposeful. “Tom and Gisele only communicate when it comes to the kids,” one insider shared. “The dust has settled, but he tries not to meddle in her personal life. He hears things from the kids here and there, but tries to stay neutral. They have a good coparenting schedule.”Though their marriage ended with difficulty, those familiar with the situation say time has softened tensions. The connection they share through their children endures, even as their personal lives move in very different directions.","Tom Brady and Gisele Bündchen are co-parenting their children from a distance.

Mike McCarthy says offense will adjust whether Aaron Rodgers returns or not

The Pittsburgh Steelers are still waiting for clarity on Aaron Rodgers, and now head coach Mike McCarthy has finally shared where things stand. Speaking about Rodgers’ future, McCarthy made it clear there is no final answer yet. He did not promise a reunion. He also did not suggest the door is closed. Instead, he explained that the team is preparing for both outcomes. “I think it is like all your experiences in life, they are assets,” McCarthy said. “We will see what the future holds, but we are definitely preparing for both scenarios.”That response shows the Steelers are still in wait-and-see mode. Rodgers has not publicly confirmed whether he plans to continue playing. McCarthy added that the quarterback is simply going through his normal offseason routine. Steelers insider Ray Fittipaldo of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reported that an answer could come around the NFL Scouting Combine. At the same time, CBS Sports reporter Aditi Kinkhabwala said on 93.7 The Fan that many people close to Rodgers believe the chances of him returning are “minuscule. ” With mixed signals coming from different directions, Pittsburgh’s plan right now is simple: stay ready.While the future remains uncertain, Mike McCarthy is building flexibility into the offense. He explained that the coaching staff is creating a system that can work for a veteran like Rodgers or for a younger quarterback.Rodgers, who threw for 3,897 yards, 28 touchdowns, and 11 interceptions last season with the New York Jets, has shown he can still produce. But McCarthy understands that planning around one name would be risky.“When you put together a playbook, the part about building an offensive system to make the quarterback successful, that will never change,” McCarthy said. “I am not naive to the fact that we could be playing with a first-year starter as opposed to a 20-plus-year starter.”He even shared a real example from a recent meeting. “We had one this morning on a play-action play, and I said, if Aaron is here, we will run it this way. If it is Will and the young guys, we will run it another way. Those are the kind of conversations you have, and it is all about having a plan.”The message from McCarthy is steady and calm. The Steelers will move forward with Rodgers if he returns. If not, they will adjust. Either way, they do not want to be caught off guard.","The Pittsburgh Steelers are still waiting for clarity on Aaron Rodgers' future.

Howie Roseman and Isaiah “Ike” Reese send clear message on A.J. Brown’s trade value

Philadelphia Eagles fans have a clear message: if any of the other 31 teams want A.J. Brown, they must bring a strong offer. General manager Howie Roseman said at his end-of-season press conference that elite wide receivers are hard to find. He did not dismiss trade talk, but he made it clear the team will not move Brown for less value. Former Eagles player Isaiah “Ike” Reese supported that view on Sports Radio 94WIP and warned teams not to send low offers.Brown remains one of the team’s top players. He holds the franchise’s two highest single-season receiving totals, with 1,456 yards in 2023 and over 1,400 yards in 2022. In 2024, despite injuries, he finished with 78 catches, 1,003 yards, and seven touchdowns. His production and role as a leader make any trade decision significant for the front office.Isaiah “Ike” Reese did not hold back when discussing the market for A.J. Brown. Speaking on Sports Radio 94WIP, he explained that some teams may think the Eagles are desperate. Reese said that would be a mistake.He said a fourth- or fifth-round pick would not even get a response. In his words, teams would need to start with at least a second-round pick to begin real talks.He added that this is the right way for Howie Roseman to handle negotiations.Howie Roseman echoed that belief during his press conference alongside head coach Nick Sirianni. He said, “It is hard to find great players in the NFL, and A.J. is a great player.”Roseman also said that when a team is trying to compete for championships, it is difficult to trade players of that level. He pointed out that Brown wears a captain’s “C” because of his importance to the locker room.There has been tension, though. In November 2024, a video surfaced where Brown showed frustration about the offense. In another interview, he said, “It is not just solely about my situation. I want to win, too.”He questioned when the offense would take more responsibility instead of relying on the defense. Later, team owner Jeffrey Lurie asked him to reduce public criticism.Money also plays a role. Trading Brown before June 1 would bring more than $40 million in dead cap charges. After June 1, that number drops below $20 million.Brown is set to carry a $23.4 million cap hit in 2026, and any new team would take on his $29 million salary in 2026.For now, Roseman’s strategy is simple. If a team truly wants A.J. Brown, it must come with a massive offer. Otherwise, the Eagles are comfortable keeping their star wide receiver.",A.J. Brown remains one of the team’s top players.

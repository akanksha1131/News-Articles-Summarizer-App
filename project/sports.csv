The fitness transformation of Indian Cricket: From Sachin to Virat | Ramji Srinivasan Exclusive

November 15 marks two significant milestones in Indian cricket history. On this date in 1989, Sachin Tendulkar made his debut, and 34 years later, Virat Kohli broke Tendulkar's record for most ODI centuries.On the same day in 2013, Tendulkar made his final international appearance after amassing 34,357 runs across all formats of the game.These achievements showcase the remarkable journey of two of India's most celebrated cricketers. The date symbolizes a connection between generations of cricket excellence in India.Tendulkar's cricket journey began at age 16 when he first played for India in a Test match against Pakistan in Karachi. During his debut match, he faced a challenging bowling attack, including fellow debutant Waqar Younis.Despite being struck on the nose by a bouncer, Tendulkar showed courage and scored 15 runs from 24 balls with two boundaries. This match launched his extraordinary 24-year career.Tendulkar went on to accumulate 15,921 Test runs and achieve 100 international centuries, setting records that seemed unbreakable at the time.On November 15, 2023, Virat Kohli reached a historic milestone during the World Cup semi-final against New Zealand at Mumbai's Wankhede Stadium. He scored his 50th ODI century, surpassing Tendulkar's previous record.Kohli achieved this feat by taking two runs off Lockie Ferguson's bowling. He reached his century in 106 balls, including eight fours and one six.This achievement was particularly meaningful as it came at Tendulkar's home ground. The record-breaking moment highlighted Kohli's consistency and skill in ODI cricket.The shared date of November 15 now represents a bridge between two cricket eras. It connects Tendulkar's debut and Kohli's record-breaking achievement, both significant moments in Indian cricket history.","November 15 marks two significant milestones in Indian cricket history.

'Control your temptations': Jasprit Bumrah reacts after stunning fifer against South Africa in 1st Test

Kolkata: How do you solve a problem like Jasprit Bumrah ? That is a question on every opposition skipper’s mind right now, especially Temba Bavuma . The South Africa skipper would have kept the Bumrah threat in mind when he chose to bat after winning the toss on Friday. However, he would have told his openers to carefully negotiate the first hour and then blunt Bumrah’s fury as the ball got older and conditions eased. However, it didn’t exactly turn out that way.Bumrah started by knocking off Ryan Rickelton’s off stump and never looked back. The conditions did ease out as it got hotter, but Bumrah did not relent. If his first seven-over spell was lethal, the other two were not much different. Even in the post-lunch session, Bumrah continued to make the ball sing. “It feels good whenever you make an impact to help the team, in whatever capacity,” Bumrah said later. “Sometimes you take time to assess the wicket and it always feels good whenever you beat the batter’s defence and knock off the stump. ”He got movement early on. In fact, the second ball of the match showed what he could do with a little help from the elements.The ball swung late after pitching and passing Aiden Markram, moving away from a chasing Rishabh Pant. The four byes were due to the movement rather than the wicketkeeper’s fault.“When I bowled the first over, everything happened. The ball swung, stayed low, went high. It was a little difficult to understand what the right length was,” Bumrah explained. “You keep bowling and you keep figuring things out. As and when the ball became softer, it did settle down. Not a lot was happening and the deviation was not consistent. So we realised when the ball is nice and hard, the seam is pronounced, it will do a little more. As and when the ball becomes softer, it will become slightly easier.”South Africa batting coach Ashwell Prince too felt the “world class” Bumrah made a lot of difference on Friday. “The batters got out to good deliveries,” he said. “It was sensational bowling, particularly from Bumrah. Mohammed Siraj did come back with a better second spell, but Bumrah was relentless today.”Test match cricket is a game of patience, feels Bumrah. “You have to be patient, find the right area to bowl and keep hitting it consistently,” he said. In India, spinners dominate and Bumrah is always keen to make an impact in the ‘limited time’ that he has. “I could do it today and it is quite satisfying to grab a five-wicket haul,” he said.","Jasprit Bumrah takes five-wicket haul in 1st Test against South Africa. India bowled first over of the match in Kolkata to take first wicket.

Shubman Gill Press Conference: Team India captain opens up about India’s bowling plan for SA Test

KOLKATA: Shubman Gill is currently one of the few cricketers in the world who continues to play in all formats. How does he handle it? “I am still trying to figure out what is the best way to manage it,” the India captain said on the eve of the first Test against South Africa here on Thursday.“It’s not easy,” he added with a note of caution. “Different formats in different places of the world have their own requirements, which is challenging. We have been playing almost back-toback since the Asia Cup, travelling to different countries, changing formats with a turnaround time of four or five days. Obviously, there will be a bit of jet lag, which makes it somewhat challenging.”The Indian Test and ODI captain is only 26, but eventually he too will need some amount of workload management.However, Gill is quick to clarify that physically he feels perfectly fine. “It is the mental thing that we need to manage. Coming here from Australia with a huge time difference means there was quite a bit of jet lag when we arrived. Playing white ball cricket in Australia and Test matches in India are entirely different.The body needs time to adjust.”Even assistant coach Ryan ten Doeschate spoke about the challenges being more mental than physical. “Shubman is doing a pretty good job at it, but it is definitely not easy,” he said on Wednesday. Virat Kohli was one player who seamlessly transitioned from one format to another, and he did that for quite a long time, with little or no side effects, physical or mental. Gill is doing the same.“I am still learning how to go about it,” Gill said.“Having said that, professional cricketers know that these challenges will be thrown at them and they need to get used to that. In fact, your fitness is defined by how you tackle them. It’s a good challenge and a good learning curve for me.”Axar Patel is another player who plays in all the formats, although he does not carry as much weight of expectations on his shoulders as Gill does. Add to that, the stress of captaincy.There’s plenty on the plate for the 26-year-old.","Shubman Gill is one of the few cricketers in the world who continues to play in all formats.

Shubman Gill Press Conference: Team India captain opens up about India’s bowling plan for SA Test

NEW DELHI: Kuldeep Yadav has requested the Indian cricket board ( BCCI ) to grant him leave for his wedding later this month. TOI understands he is waiting for approval from the board. He was forced to cancel his wedding function earlier in the year when the IPL finished later than the scheduled date due to cross-border tension between India and Pakistan.BCCI sources told TOI that Kuldeep has sought leave in the last week of Nov. There has been a debate over Kuldeep’s place in the playing XI with leftarm spinner Axar Patel fighting for the third spinner’s role in the two-Test series against South Africa starting in Kolkata on Friday.The second Test will be played in Guwahati from Nov 22. The first ODI against South Africa is in Ranchi on Nov 30. “Kuldeep’s wedding is planned for the last week of Nov. The team management will assess when they will need his services before granting him the exact number of leaves,” a BCCI source said.It will be interesting to see if Kuldeep finds a place in the XI if the pitches offer prodigious turn early in the match. He was dropped for the entire home Test season last year when India played on rank turners. He also didn’t get a Test in England this year. The team management had released him from the ODI squad in Australia to prepare for the South Africa Tests by playing for India ‘A’ against South Africa ‘A’ in Bengaluru last week. He managed just one wicket in that match. His inferior batting capabilities have come in the way of his selection as well.",Kuldeep Yadav has requested the Indian cricket board ( BCCI ) to grant him leave for his wedding later this month.

'Control your temptations': Jasprit Bumrah reacts after stunning fifer against South Africa in 1st Test

Team India was on fire on a bright, sunny day at the Eden Gardens here on Friday. There was swing, bounce and turn as the Indian attack, led by the peerless Jasprit Bumrah — who took 5/27 — decimated the opposition batting as South Africa were bowled out for 159 in their first innings after electing to bat first.The repeated pitch inspection by the Indian think-tank led to the hosts playing four spinners — a rarity — at the expense of Sai Sudharsan, who, despite scoring 87 in his previous Test, had to sit out for the sake of strategy. That might not have been necessary as the cherry blossomed through Bumrah’s fingers. The pacer, aided by some helpful conditions, picked up his 16th fivewicket haul in Tests in his first red-ball game at the Eden.The Indian reply was slow and steady in the face of some penetrative bowling by the South African pacers. South Africa, unfortunately, have to cope with the absence of Kagiso Rabada , who is out with a rib injury. With Marco Jansen sending back Yashasvi Jaiswal, India will resume on Saturday at 37/1.The floodlights, as expected, had to be switched on towards the day’s end. With Keshav Maharaj and Simon Harmer extracting turn, South Africa might also miss the services of left-arm orthodox spinner Senuran Muthusamy.True to its nature, the Eden Gardens wicket provided help to pacers in the morning. Apart from swing and bounce there was carry too, something which India coach Gautam Gambhir had wanted. There was also the odd ball which did not rise enough, planting seeds of doubt in the batters’ minds. South Africa batting coach Ashwell Prince later referred to “inconsistence bounce” as a reasons for some discomfort to their batters.Ryan Rickelton was going quite well till a good-length delivery from Bumrah left him just a shade after pitching, knocking off his off stump. Rickelton had earlier gone after Mohammed Siraj and ended with a run-a-ball 23. Aiden Markram was slow to start with and looked well settled when Bumrah stunned him with a sharply rising beauty. Markram had waited for 23 balls before opening his scoring with a copybook straight-driven boundary, following it with an equally classic cover drive to the ropes, both off Siraj.It had seemed like a good toss to win for South Africa captain Temba Bavuma, but in the end it didn’t quite look like the right call, thanks to Bumrah’s magic.Siraj, on the other hand, looked inconsistent to begin with. Compare the first spells of the two: Bumrah’s figures read 7-4-9-2 while Siraj returned 3-0-250. The contrast was evident in not just the numbers but also the way batters tackled the two.Axar Patel’s introduction in the eighth over will rank among the earliest introduction of spin in Test cricket. In fact, by lunch, India had used all their four spinners, including Kuldeep Yadav , who justified his selection by dismissing Bavuma with a gentle turner. The South Africa captain had reckoned on eve of the Test that Kuldeep wasn’t a big turner, but a wicket taker. His words proved prophetic as he lost his own wicket.With South Africa at 105/3, India went into lunch with their noses ahead. The hosts stayed ahead post lunch too, with Kuldeep and Bumrah breaking down Wiaan Mulder and Tony de Zorzi’s resistance before Siraj took two wickets in four balls.Soon after tea, the World Test champions packed up for a belowpar score.",Jasprit Bumrah took 5/27 as South Africa were bowled out for 159 in their first innings after electing to bat first. India reply was slow and steady in the face of some penetrative bowling by the South African pacers.

South Africa's star pace bowler Kagiso Rabada has been ruled out of the first Test match against India at Eden Gardens due to a rib injury sustained during training, with his availability for the second Test in Guwahati remaining uncertain as he undergoes medical assessments.Rabada injured himself during the first training session on Tuesday, leading to a series of medical evaluations that forced him to withdraw from the match at the last minute.""KG sustained the injury during the first training session on Tuesday, then he underwent a scan on Wednesday morning, and then underwent a fitness test this morning and was experiencing discomfort and then was ultimately ruled out of the game,"" explained the team media manager, as quoted by PTI.When questioned about Rabada's prospects for the second Test beginning November 22 in Guwahati, the manager stated: ""He's still undergoing further assessments with the medical team.""The South African team had kept their decision about Rabada's participation pending until Friday morning.Following Rabada's absence, Corbin Bosch was brought into the playing eleven for his fourth Test match, joining Marco Jansen and seam bowling all-rounder Wiaan Mulder in the lineup.","Kagiso Rabada has been ruled out of the first Test match against India due to a rib injury sustained during training.

NEW DELHI: James Anderson says England will enter the upcoming Ashes series as underdogs, even though he agrees with former new-ball partner Stuart Broad that Australia are at their ""weakest"" in the last 15 years. Broad, now working as a television pundit, has suggested that the current Australian side is their poorest since the 2010/11 Ashes, when England claimed a 3-1 victory.That remains England’s most recent Ashes series win in Australia, and their record there since has been dismal, with 13 losses and two draws in their last 15 Tests ‘Down Under’.However, England will take fresh confidence into next week’s series opener in Perth, especially with Australia captain and strike bowler Pat Cummins ruled out due to injury and concerns lingering over the hosts’ top-order batting lineup.Speaking to TNT Sports, Anderson — England’s all-time leading Test wicket-taker with 704 wickets — said: ""Australia have been so strong and so consistent in their team selection over the last 10 years, that this probably is their weakest team (in the last 15 years).""There are doubts around who's going to bat in the top three, Pat Cummins missing is huge. There are question marks there, definitely, and there are cracks that England could potentially expose.There's a great chance for England to get on top early.""Despite that, Anderson — who was effectively eased into Test retirement by England management last year, though he continues to play for Lancashire — cautioned that England still cannot be considered favourites. ""I don't think England are quite favourites, I'd say Australia are still favourites, in Australia.""There's still a lot of quality in their batting line-up, there's still a lot of quality with their bowlers as well, even if Cummins is missing.""Reflecting on his own role in England’s famous 2010/11 triumph, where he took 24 wickets at 26.04, Anderson added: ""So I think they probably just edge out England in terms of being favourites, but I don't think there's much in it. It's a tough one to call, so I'd say Australia, just.""","James Anderson says Australia are at their ""weakest"" in the last 15 years.

Poll Who do you think was the most crucial player released by Punjab Kings ahead of the auction? Glenn Maxwell Aaron Hardie Kuldeep Sen Vishnu Vinod

Punjab Kings have begun their pre-auction reset by parting ways with four players — Glenn Maxwell, Aaron Hardie, Kuldeep Sen and Vishnu Vinod ahead of the IPL auction scheduled for December 16 in Abu Dhabi.The decision marks the franchise’s first major movement since their runners-up finish last season, where Punjab reached the final before losing to Royal Challengers Bengaluru. Despite their strong end to the campaign, the team has opted for a rebalanced squad as they prepare for the next phase.Maxwell’s release follows a difficult season in which the Australian all-rounder struggled for form. He appeared in seven matches, scoring a meagre 48 runs and taking four wickets, before a finger injury ruled him out of the remainder of the tournament.He was later replaced by fellow Australian Mitchell Owen, and the franchise has now chosen to move on.Hardie, who was bought for Rs 1.25 crore at the last auction, did not get a game through the season. His exit was confirmed to news agency PTI by an IPL source, with Punjab Kings looking to free up overseas slots heading into the December auction.Among the domestic names, both Kuldeep Sen and Vishnu Vinod leave without featuring in a single match in IPL 2025.Sen had joined the franchise for Rs 80 lakh at the mega auction but remained on the bench throughout Punjab’s run to the final. Vinod, who arrived ahead of the season, last played an IPL match in 2023 during his stint with Mumbai Indians.Punjab Kings are expected to announce more clarity on their retention strategy as the deadline closes, with the franchise preparing for a competitive auction pool and possible structural changes. Their run last year, which saw moments of inconsistency but ultimately culminated in a late push to the title clash has prompted a reassessment of squad depth in key roles.With several teams entering the auction looking for all-round options and domestic backups, Punjab’s released list adds four notable names to the player pool. The franchise will now look to rebuild around its core as it attempts another deep run in IPL 2026.","The IPL 2026 retention deadline is scheduled for November 15.

AHMEDABAD: India’s age-level footballers need to play more competitive games to be able to challenge strong Asian footballing countries like Japan, said U-17 boys’ coach Bibiano Fernandes.“We need competition, and the competition is tough. Games competition improves players. So, a U-19 footballer from Japan plays 600 matches, while a U-19 footballer from India has played only 200 competitive matches. So, if we can cover up those games and get close to where Japanese players are, like at least 500 competitive matches by 19, then we can match in Asia,” Fernandes said ahead of the U-17 AFC Asian Cup qualifiers here next week.The U-17 team is here from Nov 1 as prep for the AFC U-17 Asian Cup qualifiers. Hosts India are clubbed with Iran, Palestine, Lebanon, and Chinese Taipei, and begin against Palestine on Nov 22, before taking on Chinese Taipei on Nov 26. The hosts then take on Lebanon on Nov 28, before a final clash against Iran.","India’s U-17 boys’ coach Bibiano Fernandes says they need to play more competitive games to be able to challenge strong Asian footballing countries like Japan. “We need competition, and the competition is tough.

Ronaldo Drops STUNNING Trump Claim in New Interview: What He REALLY Said | WATCH

France have secured their spot in the 2026 World Cup, with Kylian Mbappé leading the charge. Meanwhile, Cristiano Ronaldo faces a potential ban from Portugal's opening match if his team manages to win their European qualifying group.France achieved qualification with a convincing 4-0 victory against Ukraine at home, highlighted by Mbappé's double contribution. Portugal's path hit a roadblock after a surprising 2-0 defeat to Ireland in Dublin, where Ronaldo received his first-ever international red card.The French dominance continued in the second half as Michael Olise and substitute Hugo Ekitiké added to the scoresheet.At Parc des Princes in Paris, Mbappé opened the scoring with a penalty in the 55th minute. Olise extended the lead with a curling shot in the 76th minute, followed by Mbappé's close-range finish in the 83rd. This brought Mbappé's international goal tally to 55, just two behind Olivier Giroud's national record.""The French national team will always be better with him in it. He makes things easier for us. He performed his role perfectly this evening, as both a player and the captain of the national team,"" said coach Didier Deschamps about Mbappé.Mbappé nearly completed his hat-trick but missed a clear opportunity shortly after his second goal.France lead Group D with 13 points, while Ukraine and Iceland share seven points each, setting up a crucial match for second place on Sunday.Portugal's situation became complicated when Ronaldo received a red card for elbowing Ireland's Dara O'Shea after an hour of play. The initial yellow card was upgraded to red following a video review.""I thought it was a bit harsh. He has never been sent off before in 226 games,"" Portugal coach Roberto Martinez commented on the incident.Ronaldo will miss Portugal's match against Armenia due to the mandatory one-game suspension. FIFA rules may extend this to at least two matches for serious foul play.Ireland's victory came through Troy Parrott's two goals. He scored first with a header in the 17th minute and doubled the lead just before halftime with a low shot.Norway's World Cup prospects brightened as Erling Haaland scored twice in their 4-1 win over Estonia, moving them closer to their first World Cup appearance since 1998.Italy secured a 2-0 victory against Moldova with late goals from Gianluca Mancini and Francesco Pio Esposito. They trail Norway by three points in Group I.Italy face Norway in their final match, needing an improbable nine-goal victory to qualify directly due to Norway's superior goal difference.Haaland has contributed 14 goals to Norway's impressive total of 33 in seven group matches, the highest in European qualifying.England maintained their perfect record in Group K with a 2-0 victory over Serbia at Wembley Stadium, continuing their streak without conceding a goal.Bukayo Saka scored first for England with a left-foot volley in the 28th minute. Eberechi Eze sealed the win in the 90th minute, assisted by Phil Foden.In the same group, Albania secured second place by defeating Andorra 1-0.Portugal currently lead Group F with 10 points, followed by Hungary with eight points and Ireland with seven.

Poll Should the ISL, I-League, and I-League 2 be managed under one commercial framework? Yes, it will promote parity No, each league should have its own management

Amid the ongoing turmoil in Indian football, Union Sports Minister Mansukh Mandaviya met representatives of I-League clubs in New Delhi on Thursday to discuss their concerns and explore possible solutions to the escalating standoff between the All India Football Federation (AIFF), the Indian Super League (ISL), and I-League teams.The meeting, attended by seven representatives from among the 14 I-League clubs, was also joined by Sports Secretary and SAI Director General Hari Ranjan Rao and Joint Secretary Kunal. According to a senior official present, Mandaviya “gave a patient hearing to the I-League representatives” and urged the Sports Authority of India to mediate discussions going forward for the time being.“The minister gave a patient hearing to the I-League representatives and for the time being instructed SAI to step in and engage with the stakeholders. He wants a constructive dialogue between officials of the AIFF, the Indian Super League (ISL) and I-League,” a source told PTI.The intervention from the ministry comes a day after I-League clubs boycotted a meeting convened by the AIFF to address the deepening crisis triggered by the federation’s inability to secure a new commercial partner.The fallout of the AIFF’s failed renewal with Football Sports Development Limited (FSDL), which had managed the ISL and related commercial activities, has left domestic football in uncertainty.With the partnership collapsing ahead of its December expiry, the 2025–26 ISL season remains on hold, and top I-League clubs, including defending champions Mohun Bagan, have suspended training sessions.The I-League clubs have demanded that all tiers of Indian football, namely the ISL, I-League, and I-League 2 be managed under a single commercial framework to ensure parity and stability.The AIFF’s search for a new partner is being monitored by the Supreme Court, which approved a revised constitution for the federation in October.The ministry is expected to facilitate further discussions between the AIFF, ISL and I-League representatives in the coming days to help break the deadlock.","Union Sports Minister Mansukh Mandaviya met representatives of I-League clubs in New Delhi on Thursday.

Poll Should Oscar consider retiring to prioritize his health? Yes, absolutely No, he should continue playing if possible

Former Chelsea and Brazil midfielder Oscar was taken to hospital after suffering a heart-related issue during a pre-season training session with São Paulo. The club confirmed that the 34-year-old is in stable condition and under medical observation.According to reports in Brazil, the incident occurred during fitness tests on an exercise bike when Oscar collapsed and briefly lost consciousness. He was attended to immediately by medical staff before being transported to hospital in an ambulance.São Paulo released an official statement confirming the episode and the player’s current status. “During tests carried out on Tuesday morning, at SuperCT, as part of pre-season preparation, athlete Oscar presented a complication with cardiac changes, and was promptly treated by the club's professionals and the medical team from Einstein Hospital Israelita, who were present at the scene,” the club said.It further added: “The player was then taken to the hospital, where he is clinically stable and remains under observation for further tests to clarify the diagnosis.”Oscar, who returned to his boyhood club São Paulo on a free transfer last December, has a contract with the team until 2027.

Portuguese superstar Cristiano Ronaldo has urged Ireland fans to boo him when Portugal take the field in Thursday’s World Cup qualifier in Dublin. Speaking at a press conference on Wednesday, the 40-year-old said he hoped the home supporters’ focus on him might ease the pressure on his teammates as Portugal look to secure qualification for the 2026 World Cup.“The stadium will boo me, I’m used to it, I certainly hope they do — maybe it will take the pressure off other players,” Ronaldo told reporters in Dublin. Portugal sit five points clear at the top of Group F with two games left, and a win over Ireland would seal their spot in next year’s World Cup. Ronaldo, who is aiming to feature in his sixth edition of the tournament, said he expects a tough contest against an Irish side that will likely defend deep.“It will be a difficult match,” he said. “Ireland will sit back and make it hard for us to find space.”The Al Nassr forward was also asked about the possibility of scoring his 1000th career goal in the World Cup final, which he dismissed with a laugh. “You’ve been watching too many movies, that would be too perfect,” Ronaldo joked. “It’s always good to score goals — that’s my job. I want to play in this next World Cup, otherwise I wouldn’t be here, but let’s take it step by step.”Ronaldo has scored 953 career goals and holds the record for the most goals in men’s international football with 143. While he hinted earlier this week that the 2026 World Cup could be his last, Ronaldo chose not to dwell on his future this time.“There’s no point in being repetitive and losing focus,” he said. “Maybe later I’ll speak more clearly about what I think for the future, but right now, the goal is qualification.”","Cristiano Ronaldo has urged Ireland fans to boo him when Portugal take the field in Thursday's World Cup qualifier in Dublin.

Three of India's top football clubs have halted operations amid the uncertainty over the future of the sport in the country.

The departure of Brian Daboll from the New York Giants created an immediate buzz around one name. Many wondered if Bill Belichick, one of football’s most accomplished minds, might consider a return to the NFL. His past with the franchise made the idea tempting for fans who still associate him with some of the team’s proudest moments. That anticipation grew louder through the week, only for Belichick himself to silence it in a clear and direct way. His statement on Friday night cut through the noise and left no room for doubt about his future.Belichick addressed the rumors with sincerity that reflected his long-standing ties to New York. “I have great respect and genuinely care for the New York Giants organization and both the Mara and Tisch families,” Belichick said. He added that his years with the Giants shaped his career, calling it a privilege to work under the Mara family and alongside Bill Parcells. Still, he shut down the speculation with finality, saying, “However, despite circulating rumors, I have not and will not pursue any NFL head coaching vacancies.” With that, he placed his current mission front and center.Belichick reminded everyone where his priorities now lie. “Since arriving in Chapel Hill, my commitment to the UNC Football program has not wavered. We have tremendous support from the university, our alumni, and the entire Carolina community. My focus remains solely on continuing to improve this team, develop our players, and build a program that makes Tar Heel fans proud.” His words came at a time when the Tar Heels are battling through a challenging 4-5 start, though recent wins hint at a team gaining confidence.His history with the Giants explains why the rumors had traction. From 1979 to 1990, Belichick helped shape New York’s defensive identity, eventually becoming defensive coordinator and winning two Super Bowls. Those years cemented his legacy, but nostalgia alone was never going to pull him away from Chapel Hill.At 73, Belichick now appears content with the college game unless circumstances shift drastically. He reiterated that stance again through ESPN’s Adam Schefter, repeating, “Despite circulating rumors, I have not and will not pursue any NFL head coaching vacancies.” And in vintage fashion, he ended with a familiar touch: “We’re on to Wake Forest.”","Belichick addressed the rumors with sincerity that reflected his long-standing ties to New York.

Cam Newton says Eagles dysfunction is growing



More NFL coverage

A few hours after a video surfaced of A.J. Brown calling everything outside his family life “a s*** show,” the Philadelphia Eagles star decided to explain what pushed him to speak so bluntly. His tone did not change, and neither did his message. Brown said his frustration comes from the offense falling behind week after week while the defense keeps dragging the team to safety. His comments arrived after a win that did little to calm concerns, especially with him recording only two catches for 13 yards.Brown made it clear on Wednesday that he was not taking anything back. He insisted that he cares about holding the offense to a higher standard. He said, “We can’t just keep slapping a Band-Aid over the defense doing their job and getting us out of trouble. At what point are we going to pick up our slack as an offense?” His words hit at a deeper truth. The Eagles sit near the bottom of the league in passing and in third down success. Brown, who is headed toward the lowest receiving totals of his career, said he is pushing for accountability, not attention.Cam Newton entered the conversation on Friday during his appearance on ESPN’s “First Take,” and he did not hold back.He said, “The Philadelphia Eagles (are) a walking ticking time bomb of dysfunction.” Newton argued that winning has hidden the real problems. He pointed to moments that looked small at the time but now feel like warnings. One example was Nick Sirianni’s emotional exchange with fans in October 2024. Another was the string of sideline flare ups and the decision last season to “call off the dogs” despite a powerful run game.Newton said these were all signs that something underneath was beginning to crack. He pushed back on the idea that Brown crossed a line. He saw it as honesty and responsibility. According to him, Brown is “setting the record straight” about what the offense should deliver each week.Newton added, “When you have a person to speak truth … I do not have an issue with my receiver saying that, because he is 100% right. The defense has been carrying the Philadelphia Eagles.” He closed by stressing that top receivers do not want to be puppets in the offense.

Brittany Mahomes speaks out with heartfelt plea as family close to friends loses home in devastating fire

More coverage on NFL:

Brittany Mahomes is known for showing up loudly and proudly on game days, but this week she showed up in an entirely different way, using her platform to rally support for a family facing a life-altering tragedy. As the Kansas City Chiefs prepare to climb back into the playoff race, the Mahomes household has shifted some focus toward a crisis far more personal than football standings.A fire that destroyed a neighbor’s home prompted Brittany to take action, while Patrick Mahomes was simultaneously being recognized for his own charitable efforts in Texas. Together, the couple’s response highlights how deeply they stay connected to the communities and people around them, even amid the pressures of an NFL season.On Thursday, Brittany revealed a heartbreaking situation involving a neighbor of close friends. “Hi guys, a friend of ours neighbor just lost their home to a fire!” she shared on Instagram. “If you feel inclined to help please do 🙏🏼 A little goes a long way in times like these so anything helps!🤍 thank yall🤍” She also linked a GoFundMe that explained how the fire erupted after the family’s children put away a s’mores maker, sparking an unexpected blaze.Though the family escaped unharmed, the flames consumed everything they owned. The page emphasized the urgency of their situation, especially with the holidays approaching, noting that while insurance will help, it cannot address the immediate emotional and financial strain.Meanwhile, Patrick Mahomes received praise for quietly helping raise $130,000 for the Heaven’s 27 Foundation, created after devastating Texas flooding claimed more than 130 lives. Josh Abbott revealed Mahomes’ role, writing, “This dude helped us raise $130,000 at our benefit concert for heavens27foundation.”The couple’s own 15 and the Mahomies Foundation continues to be a major force as well, recently raising over $1.5 million at its annual gala to support children’s programs and community initiatives.As the Chiefs come off their bye week and work to strengthen their playoff chances after a 5–4 start, the Mahomes family’s outreach serves as a reminder that their biggest wins don’t always happen on the field.","Brittany Mahomes shared a heartfelt plea for a neighbor's family who lost their home in a devastating fire.

Taylor Swift’s shift toward a grand celebration signals a wedding built on joy, legacy, and star power

More coverage on NFL:

Taylor Swift may have spent the past year entertaining the idea of a quiet, close-to-home ceremony, but insiders now say the pop superstar has made a dramatic pivot. After months of speculation, Swift is no longer leaning toward understated simplicity, she’s embracing spectacle.According to sources, the singer, who has spent nearly two decades mastering the art of grand storytelling, wants her wedding to Travis Kelce to reflect the same scale as the life she’s built. Early reports hint at a celebration designed not just as a romantic milestone but as a full-blown cultural moment, one that mirrors her status as a global icon and her desire to savor a “once-in-a-lifetime” event with the people who’ve shaped her journey.Insiders speaking to Radar Online claim Swift ultimately abandoned the idea of a small gathering after realizing it didn’t match the magnitude of the moment. One source shared, “Taylor went back and forth, but she’s decided there’s no sense in doing a wedding on the smaller side,” adding, “There’s no doubt in her mind that this is the only time she’ll tie the knot, so having a bigger bash is a no-brainer.”Her reported guest list, expected to top 300, reads like a cross-section of contemporary entertainment power players.Selena Gomez, Gigi Hadid, Cara Delevingne, Brittany Mahomes, and lifelong friend Abigail Anderson are among the names insiders say will receive invitations. The event is rumored to be planned for early to mid-2026, with Swift’s father, Scott Swift, set to walk her down the aisle, while Jason Kelce will stand beside his brother as best man.Swift has already teased her excitement publicly, telling Graham Norton she’s “so excited” for the planning process and knows “it’s gonna be fun to plan.” Music is expected to be central to the festivities, potentially with performances from Swift herself and friends like Selena Gomez and Sabrina Carpenter, transforming the ceremony into a celebration of her artistry as much as her relationship.If insiders are correct, Swift isn’t just preparing for a wedding. She’s crafting a defining cultural moment, one that honors her love story with Kelce while marking the beginning of a new chapter with characteristic boldness and heart.","Taylor Swift is reportedly planning a grand wedding for Travis Kelce.

The viral Antonio Brown post-release moment that surprised everyone

More coverage from NFL:



Antonio Brown is officially out of jail after spending seven days behind bars on a second-degree attempted murder charge and the moment he walked free immediately became the headline of the day.The former NFL wide receiver posted a $25,000 bond in Miami and stepped out wearing a GPS ankle monitor with his attorney by his side. Instead of laying low, Brown headed straight to a food truck parked just outside, turning his release into an unexpected viral moment as the legal world shifts its attention to what comes next.When Brown finally walked out of the facility, social media expected a dramatic statement not a trip to a food truck. Yet that’s exactly what happened. With his attorney beside him, AB made a quick detour to pick up food moments after his release. The sight of a freshly freed Brown grabbing a meal within minutes of leaving jail quickly spread online, becoming the unexpected visual tied to his return to the outside world. While lighthearted on the surface, the moment stood in sharp contrast to the seriousness of the charge he still faces.Brown’s release came after a Miami judge granted him bond on the serious charge tied to a shooting incident earlier this year. He remained in custody for seven days before finally posting the $25,000 bail required for release. As part of the court’s conditions, Brown must wear a GPS ankle monitor, remain within Broward County, and surrender any passport he may have. These restrictions are meant to ensure he stays put as the case moves forward.The charge against Brown stems from a May 16–17 incident in Miami tied to a celebrity boxing event. According to investigators, Brown allegedly fired shots at a man he had been involved with during the event, triggering a fast-moving police investigation. Court documents detail the confrontation, the reported tension between Brown and the alleged victim, and the physical altercation that preceded the shooting. Brown has maintained his innocence, and his legal team has made clear they plan to fight the charge aggressively. For now, the court proceedings continue as prosecutors prepare their case.Brown’s legal path is far from settled. He is expected back in court soon as prosecutors outline the direction of the attempted murder case. The second-degree charge carries significant potential prison time if convicted, and the upcoming hearings may determine whether the case heads toward trial or potential negotiations. His attorney has already signaled confidence, but the conditions of Brown’s release including travel limits and ongoing monitoring suggest the court is taking the allegations seriously.","Antonio Brown was released from jail after seven days on a second-degree attempted murder charge.

What we know about Jaylon Johnson’s injury, recovery timeline, and realistic return expectations

possible

More coverage on NFL:



If you’re a Bears fan who’s been refreshing injury reports like it’s a full-time job, today finally feels different. After weeks of silence, setbacks, and “will he, won’t he” energy, Chicago just made the move everyone was waiting for, cornerback Jaylon Johnson is officially back on the practice field.It’s the first real sign of life since he went down with that stubborn groin/core muscle injury earlier this season, and trust me, the vibes instantly changed. A Pro Bowl CB returning this late in the year? Yeah, the stakes just got spicy.The Bears have activated the 21-day practice window for Jaylon Johnson, which means the team can now evaluate him before deciding whether to officially move him back onto the active roster. This is the first time Johnson has been seen practicing since undergoing surgery to repair a groin/core-muscle issue that originally surfaced in the offseason and flared up again early in Week 2.Coach Ben Johnson (no relation) confirmed that the corner is “in a good spot,” but there’s still a ramp-up period ahead. Translation: the Bears are hyped, but they’re not rushing him into action until he’s fully ready.Johnson’s injury wasn’t some minor tweak, it was a complicated core-muscle issue that required surgery and weeks of rehab.The Bears placed him on injured reserve in late September, and he hasn’t played a snap since. Now that he’s finally practicing again, the Bears have a 21-day window to decide his fate: activate him, or shut him down for the rest of the season.A few reports have floated around December 7 as areturn date, but nothing is guaranteed. The coaching staff expects him to build up strength, regain lower-body explosiveness, and most importantly trust the repaired area before taking live snaps.It’s progress. Big progress. But it’s not a “see you Sunday” situation just yet.Anyone who’s watched the Bears defense this season knows one thing, they miss Jaylon Johnson badly. He’s a two-time Pro Bowler, a matchup corner, and one of the few players on the roster who can erase half the field on a good day. Losing him early in the year forced Chicago to rotate younger players, shift coverages, and basically play defensive Tetris every week.",The Bears have activated the 21-day practice window for Jaylon Johnson.

A shocking Golden State twist emerges as Jonathan Kuminga hits an untimely hurdle

The Golden State Warriors just had a significant comeback victory. However, they will be short-staffed when they play the San Antonio Spurs on Friday night. Jonathan Kuminga has been excluded from the match. Golden State is attempting to be cautious with an ongoing injury, so Kuminga will not play for the Warriors on Friday.He has been diagnosed with bilateral knee tendinitis. One of the Warriors' key young players will be absent, but their older stars are all scheduled to participate. However, Kuminga was compelled to withdraw from the competition on Wednesday. Due to a knee injury, the 23-year-old was unable to return after heading to the locker room during the first half.Going into the 2025–26 season, the Golden State Warriors wanted to be a championship contender. They might have advanced to the Western Conference Finals if Stephen Curry hadn't suffered a hamstring injury during the second round of the previous season's playoffs.With six straight road losses and five more away games before returning to the comfortable confines of the Chase Centre, the Golden State Warriors have reportedly resembled a sinking ship lately.Even coach Steve Kerr is experimenting with the lineup to try and make it successful.Additionally, they are trying to be precautionary with the lingering injury. Hence, Jonathan Kuminga will not play Friday for the Warriors against the Spurs. However, thankfully, there is no structural damage, according to Anthony Slater of ESPN. Slater said:""Absence should be relatively short-term, but Kuminga/Warriors want to manage some of the recent soreness he’s been experiencing.""This season, Golden State is reportedly aiming high, and the objective is to have as many of its talented players accessible as possible. On Wednesday, when the Warriors travelled to Frost Bank Centre to play the San Antonio Spurs, Jonathan Kuminga was benched.They defeated Victor Wembanyama and company 125-120 thanks to head coach Steve Kerr's decision to alter his starting lineup. After a six-game losing streak away from home, Golden State's first road victory was much-needed.Meanwhile, due to an injury sustained during the previous season, Kuminga hardly played after Jimmy Butler arrived in town. Now, the Warriors need to find a flow because they haven't been playing well. By the time Kuminga returns, his role may be reduced if they manage to find the rhythm without him.Also read: Is Jonathan Kuminga playing tonight?

LaMelo Ball's bold revelation reportedly left Minnesota Timberwolves in shock

Charlotte Hornets LaMelo Ball has recently made the news for a comment. He reportedly informed the Minnesota Timberwolves that his ultimate goal was to become President of the United States. This is allegedly the reason why the Wolves didn't sign him.Jon Krawczynski of The Athletic recently discussed why the Timberwolves chose Anthony Edwards over Ball with the first overall choice in the 2020 NBA draft during an appearance this week on The Ringer's Zach Lowe Show. The Minnesota Timberwolves front staff apparently took issue with LaMelo Ball's response to a pre-draft interview question prior to the 2020 NBA draft.Five years ago, LaMelo Ball reportedly shocked the Minnesota Timberwolves during a pre-Draft interview. The Timberwolves were contemplating LaMelo as a possible option for their team throughout the selection process, according to Jon Krawczynski of The Athletic. However, the young player's unexpected response altered their choice.Krawczynski said on The Zach Lowe Show that Minnesota was very close to selecting the point guard with the first pick. However, the Wolves were reportedly put off by a strange response during an already subpar pre-draft interview. Krawczynski stated:“So, we know they picked [Anthony] Edwards.. But that’s not my little nugget for you all. It’s why they picked Edwards. They had an interview with LaMelo Ball during this process, trying to figure out, ‘Hey, is this the guy for us?’ And LaMelo — did not interview very well…”He clarified the same on Live from Minnesota with Zach Lowe and said:“One of the questions they asked him was: ‘Hey LaMelo, after you’re done playing, what do you see yourself doing? What kind of things do you aspire to?”He continued:“There were a million different reasons in their evaluation.But one of them was that they had an interview with LaMelo Ball during this process—trying to figure out, ‘Hey, is this the guy for us?’ And LaMelo… did not interview very well... and LaMelo said, 'I want to be President of the United States'.""This statement led the executives of the team to consider whether LaMelo would be a good fit for their long-term goals. Ball has had a great career to date, averaging 21.1 points, 7.5 assists, 6.0 rebounds, 3.1 three-pointers made, and 1.5 steals a game over his six NBA seasons. In 2020–21, he won NBA Rookie of the Year, and in his second season he was chosen an All-Star for the first - and only - time.LaMelo has emerged as a rising star in the NBA and was the eventual selection of the Charlotte Hornets.

Stephen Curry’s split from Under Armour sparks concern among fans



More coverage on the NBA -

Stephen Curry, the Golden State Warriors’ star player, and one of the most popular athletes in the world, has announced his split from his 13 year old partnership with Under Armour.The announcement has sparked panic among fans as many fail to understand the reason behind the split, considering how profitable the Curry Brand has been.A few hours ago, Under Armour CEO Kevin Plank issued a statement that read as, “For Under Armour, this moment is about discipline and focus on the core UA brand during a critical stage of our turnaround…”The statement added, “And for Stephen, it’s the right moment to let what we created evolve on his terms. We’ll always be grateful for what he’s brought to the UA team.”But this has sparked panic and concern among fans. A fan by the username @MarimPinto wrote, “Under Armour just hit the eject button on their splashiest splash? Massive fumble! Steph's about to cook up a Curry Brand takeover.”Another fan by the username @7getrich_griff wrote, “Yeaa under armor drop the ball on this one 😭 let the downfall begin”, while a third fan by the username @streamerbinge_ posted, “They should be out of business the way they handled the goat over the last decade 😭 go to Nike or adidas.”Another fan by the username @GageMyers10 wrote, “Probably an unpopular opinion- I think this hurts each other equally. Curry is at the end of his playing days, and will never reach the popularity he once had. I don’t see brands paying what they once would. Curry also is face of UA, which leaves them faceless. Odd scenario.”The Golden State Warriors’ star player has issued a statement about his split from Under Armour as he wrote, “What Curry Brand stands for, what I stand for and my commitment to that mission will never change, it’s only growing stronger…”Stephen Curry added, “I’m excited for a future that’s focused on aggressive growth with a continued commitment to keep showing up for the next generation.”However, neither Stephen Curry nor his wife, Ayesha Curry, has responded to the drama this split has sparked.As of now, it seems Stephen Curry is keeping his focus on the new season and keeping his family out of the spotlight.","Stephen Curry has announced his split from his 13 year old partnership with Under Armour.

Joel Embiid health update: Philadelphia 76ers legend's status and health issues against Detroit Pistons revealed (11-14-2025),https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nba/top-stories/is-joel-embiid-playing-tonight-vs-detroit-pistons-philadelphia-76ers-legends-status-and-health-issues-revealed-11-11-2025/articleshow/125334363.cms,"Joel Embiid is not playing tonight (Image via NBA)

Philadelphia 76ers take cautious approach as Joel Embiid manages ongoing knee concerns

On Friday, the Detroit Pistons and Philadelphia 76ers square off in a box office regular-season match. However, the Sixers are missing one of their key players- Joel Embiid. The 76ers' injury report for Friday’s game against Pistons does not include the star player.Embiid might play the next match after missing so many matches. Despite averaging 19.7 points, 5.5 rebounds, 3.3 assists, and 1.5 blocks in 23.3 minutes per game across his six regular-season outings, the star big man has yet to record more than 26 minutes in a game. Joel Embiid , the star center for the Philadelphia 76ers, is still dealing with injuries. According to Keith Pompey of the Philadelphia Inquirer, the former NBA MVP was sidelined for Philadelphia's home game against the Boston Celtics on Tuesday due to right knee soreness. He will be sidelined for another game. Additionally, he was also sidelined for the Sixers' Friday night game against the Pistons in Detroit.Embiid was cleared to play against the Toronto Raptors on Saturday. After missing Wednesday's loss to Cleveland, the star center for the Philadelphia 76ers was not listed on the official injury report, indicating his return to action as the team attempts to restore momentum.However, now, the 76ers have decided to rest their star center for the second part of a back-to-back, thus Joel Embiid will not play against the Detroit Pistons tonight. The choice ensures that Embiid's knee stays healthy during the lengthy NBA season and is consistent with the team's load management plan.The current MVP will take the night off to recover after scoring a season-high 29 points and grabbing six rebounds in just 26 minutes. In order to protect his left knee, the former MVP had already said during preseason that he would miss consecutive games.A long-term plan to maintain his health throughout the season includes this scheduled relaxation. Given Embiid's history of knee issues, the 76ers have placed a high premium on his health.As a precaution, the squad keeps a careful eye on his workload and steers clear of back-to-back appearances. As Philadelphia strives to stay competitive well into the season, this strategy demonstrates a dedication to long-term success above immediate outcomes.Embiid will possibly play again soon. Despite averaging 19.7 points, 5.5 rebounds, 3.3 assists, and 1.5 blocks in 23.3 minutes per game across his six regular-season outings, the star big man has yet to record more than 26 minutes in a game. So far this season, his shooting splits are 46.0/32.1/82.9.In the four games that Embiid has missed this season, the 76ers have lost three of them. The Philadelphia team, which began the season with four straight wins prior to its recent two-game losing streak, will benefit greatly from his return.Also read: Is Joel Embiid playing tonight?

Charlotte Hornets Injury Situation vs Milwaukee Bucks (November 14, 2025)

Milwaukee Bucks vs Charlotte Hornets vs Game Dynamics and Expectations (November 14, 2025)

The Milwaukee Bucks and Charlotte Hornets are set to face off in an intriguing NBA regular-season clash on November 14, 2025, as both franchises navigate a long list of injuries that could shape the direction of the matchup. With several key stars either sidelined or returning under monitored conditions, the game promises a combination of uncertainty, tactical adjustments, and high-stakes decision-making for both coaching staffs.Both teams enter this contest with different expectations, but a shared challenge: finding consistency while managing significant health setbacks. For Milwaukee, the spotlight remains on Giannis Antetokounmpo’s availability, while Charlotte looks toward LaMelo Ball’s potential return to stabilize their offense. These developments add layers of intrigue to a matchup that could influence early-season momentum in the Eastern Conference standings.The Milwaukee Bucks are contending with a notably depleted rotation, although the probable return of Giannis Antetokounmpo offers a major lift. Giannis continues to manage left knee patellar tendinopathy, which may restrict his minutes, but his presence alone dramatically impacts Milwaukee’s interior scoring and defensive identity.Beyond Giannis, however, the Bucks face widespread absences across their lineup.Kevin Porter Jr. remains unavailable after undergoing right knee meniscus surgery, prolonging a sizable gap in Milwaukee’s backcourt depth and secondary scoring. Taurean Prince is also out indefinitely following surgery to address a herniated disc in his neck, reducing the Milwaukee Bucks’ forward versatility. The injury list continues with Alex Antetokounmpo, who will miss the game due to a right knee issue, and Dejounte Murray, still recovering from a right Achilles rupture - a major long-term setback for Milwaukee’s guard rotation. Adding to the challenge, Jordan Poole is sidelined by a left quad strain, leaving the Milwaukee Bucks without another reliable shot-creator. With several starters and bench contributors limited or unavailable, Milwaukee will lean heavily on Giannis and expect elevated contributions from role players like Kyle Kuzma and Myles Turner.Meanwhile, the Charlotte Hornets are cautiously optimistic about LaMelo Ball’s return. Listed as probable, Ball has been recovering from a right ankle impingement that forced him to miss multiple games. His ability to return as the team’s primary playmaker could significantly boost Charlotte’s offensive rhythm and spacing.However, the Charlotte Hornets face their own depth concerns. Josh Green is ruled out following left shoulder surgery, removing a key perimeter defender and wing scorer. Grant Williams will also sit out due to a right hamstring strain, affecting Charlotte’s frontcourt depth. Ryan Kalkbrenner is unavailable for personal reasons, while other players, including Terry Rozier, remain out with various injuries. These absences could leave Charlotte vulnerable in interior defense and rebounding.Also read: Is LaMelo Ball playing tonight vs the Milwaukee Bucks? Latest update on the Charlotte Hornets star's injury report (November 14, 2025) With both teams entering the matchup short-handed, their remaining stars, rotation adaptability, and bench productivity could be the deciding factors. Milwaukee, at 7-5, aims to maintain early-season stability, while the Charlotte Hornets hope LaMelo Ball’s presence can spark renewed momentum. The combined injury challenges elevate the unpredictability of this Eastern Conference meeting, making it a compelling watch for NBA fans on November 14, 2025.","Milwaukee Bucks and Charlotte Hornets set to face off in an NBA regular-season clash on November 14, 2025.

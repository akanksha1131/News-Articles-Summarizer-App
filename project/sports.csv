Mohammed Shami

Poll Should Mohammed Shami be included in the squad for the upcoming New Zealand ODIs? Yes, he's fit and performing well No, age concerns should be prioritized Only if he proves fitness in the next match He should work on fitness more





In the ongoing domestic season, Mohammed Shami has already sent down over 200 overs for Bengal. He has played the Ranji Trophy , Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy and is currently playing the Vijay Hazare Trophy. Even though he continues to stay on the sidelines for the national team, the seamer continues to do what he does best - make the ball talk and pick wickets with ease.There have been verbal volleys between Shami and chief selector Ajit Agarkar whenever the bowler didn't get a call-up and his much debated absence will be up for discussion again when the selectors meet to pick the squad for New Zealand ODIs in the first week of January.Agarkar has been repeatedly questioned about the omission and has maintained the ""need to play some cricket"" stand. If 145.2 overs in Ranji Trophy, 26.5 overs in SMAT and 34.2 overs in ongoing VHT doesn't qualify, then the definition of ""some cricket"" needs to be made clear.Shami, 35, last played for India in the Champions Trophy - where he was the lone specialist seamer doing the heavy lifting on turners - and returned with 9 wickets from five games, including a 5/53 outing.The skill and quality has never been a doubt but it was the recurring fitness issues which became a big roadblock in his selection.The chief selector had revealed during an event that Shami would have been on the flight to England had he been fit.But those are now conversations and discussions of the past. Looking ahead, selectors will find it really hard to ignore the experienced seamer for the three games against New Zealand starting January 11.He has given a terrific account of his fitness with regular outings for Bengal and the List A outings have been impressive with eight wickets in four games.The age argument could be tabled keeping the 2027 World Cup in mind but if Mitchell Starc can run through oppositions at 35, Scott Boland can be penetrative at 36 and Michael Nesser can make an impact at 35 for Australia, Shami can surely do his magic if he is carefully managed for the multi-nation event in South Africa.The right-arm seamer missed the early phase of the 2023 ODI World Cup due to combination calls but the moment he found a place in the XI, he showed what India missed. A genuine wicket-taker with an ability to singlehandedly run through oppositions. And not to forget the experience he brings to the table and how it would be of immense help to the likes of Harshit Rana and Prasidh Krishna.""If he is fit, why wouldn’t we have a bowler like Shami? I have had multiple chats with him. Over the last six to eight months, what we have found out is that he wasn’t fit,"" Agarkar had said during an event in New Delhi.Shami is fit. Shami is in top rhythm. Shami is picking wickets. Over to Agarkar & Co. now.","Mohammed Shami is in top rhythm and is picking wickets for Bengal. Chief selector Ajit Agarkar has maintained the ""need to play some cricket"" stand.

NEW DELHI: Australian selectors have named a spin-heavy squad as the defending champions gear up for the upcoming ICC Men’s T20 World Cup in Sri Lanka and India.The 2021 champions, announced on Thursday, have opted not to include a left-arm pacer following Mitchell Starc’s retirement from T20 Internationals.

They then travel to Kandy for group-stage fixtures against Sri Lanka on February 16 and Oman on February 20.Pat Cummins’ participation in the tournament remains uncertain, with a scan on his back scheduled later this month set to determine his availability. Josh Hazlewood and Tim David, meanwhile, are both working their way back from hamstring injuries.Under ICC regulations, teams are permitted to make changes to their squads until January 31.Australia will play a three-match T20I series against Pakistan later this month as part of their preparation.All of Australia’s group-stage matches will be played in Sri Lanka, though the side will travel to India for at least part of the Super Eights stage should they progress.

Your maiden List A hundred came in a win. How special was it for you?

Your form has sparked talk of an India call-up in white-ball cricket...

What has it been like playing under UP captain

Dhruv Jurel’s maiden List A century — an unbeaten 160 off 101 balls against Baroda in Rajkot on Dec 29 — has come at a time when India are set to play a three-match home ODI series against New Zealand. The Uttar Pradesh wicketkeeperbatter’s form has pushed him into the selection conversation. Jurel has begun the Vijay Hazare Trophy by scoring 307 runs in three matches at an average of 153.5.Winning is what matters. All 11 players work towards one goal. Every contribution counts — someone scoring 30 off 15 balls can be as valuable as someone scoring 100. Matches are won through team effort, so I’m very happy.I’m always excited to play red-ball cricket and am very fortunate to have played Tests for India. Test cricket has its own value. When you go abroad and people call you a Test cricketer, it feels good. Red-ball is close to my heart and brings a different kind of respect. I’m already thinking about our series in Sri Lanka in 7-8 months, how I can prepare, the sessions we get with spinners, how I can tackle spin better. These little things — the planning and visualisation — keep going on.I don’t set too many goals for myself. I focus on the process. Even before the Vijay Hazare Trophy, when I got some time, I was batting for 4-5 hours and creating scenarios in my mind about what I can do. Whatever the result and selection may be, no one can take my hard work away from me. That’s why I work hard. It has brought me this far and will take me further.It has been very good. I’ve watched him since childhood. He is one of India’s best finishers. I try to learn from him.

NEW DELHI: India had a proud moment at the World Rapid and Blitz Chess Championships as Arjun Erigaisi delivered a double medal performance on Tuesday in Doha, Qatar.The 22-year-old chess star won bronze medals in both the Rapid and Blitz events. With the medals, he also became the first Indian player to register podium finishes at both events since Viswanathan Anand won the Rapid section and finished third in Blitz back in 2017.This came after he had already won a bronze in the Rapid section earlier in the tournament. Winning medals in both formats at the same championship is very rare and shows the player's consistency. However, the result could have been even better for the Telangana-born Grandmaster.On Tuesday, Arjun faced Nodirbek Abdusattorov in the semifinals of the World Blitz Championship. Abdusattorov won the first two games, while the third game ended in a draw.As a result, Arjun had to settle for the bronze medal, while five-time World Champion and top-ranked chess player Magnus Carlsen and Abdusattorov moved on to play the final, where Carlsen's astute end-game manoeuvres eventually earned him a coveted win over Abdusattorov with a 2.5-1.5 score.Subsequently, Carlsen clinched the Blitz gold here as well after becoming champion in the Rapid section on Sunday.On the other hand, Bibisara Assaubayeva of Kazakhstan became the Women's World Blitz Champion.Despite the disappointment at the end, Arjun’s overall performance in the Blitz Championship was impressive.On both occasions, Arjun came very close to reaching the final and fighting for the championship title.He topped the Swiss segment of the Blitz tournament with a strong score of 15 points out of 19. But perhaps luck was not in his favour.Still, the bigger picture remains very positive.Arjun Erigaisi finished third in the Blitz event and added another bronze medal to his tally, meaning he has wrapped up his final tournament of the year, the World Rapid and Blitz Championships, with two bronze medals.While the ending may have been painful for him and his fans, as the result could've been better, Arjun’s performance showed that he belongs among the world’s best.",Arjun Erigaisi won bronze medals in both the Rapid and Blitz events.

NEW DELHI: World No. 1 Magnus Carlsen once again showcased his endgame brilliance, clinching a record-extending ninth World Blitz title to go with the Rapid gold medal he won two days earlier. However, Indian Grandmaster Arjun Erigaisi endured a dramatic collapse in the semifinals and had to settle for a bronze medal at the World Blitz Championship on Tuesday.In the title match against young Uzbek GM Nodirbek Abdusattorov, Carlsen turned down a draw and produced a stunning, unexpected pawn move in the fourth game to seal a 2.5–1.5 victory, further cementing his dominance in blitz chess.After the first three games, both the players were tied at 1.5 points each.The victory was all the more sweet and fulfilling for the Norwegian after a string of losses in the qualifying (Swiss round) where he literally struggled to secure a place in the knockout semifinals.A draw in Round 19 against Abdusattorov saw both Carlsen (13.5 points) and the Uzbek (13 points) secure the last two slots in the semifinals on Tuesday behind sole leader Erigaisi (15 points) and American GM Fabiano Caruana (14 points).Carlsen then went on to beat Caruana 3-1 to secure a place in the final, while an impeccable Abdusattorov inflicted a shattering 2.5-0.5 semifinal defeat on Erigaisi, as the Indian settled for a second bronze, after taking the third-podium spot in Rapid on Sunday.Nonetheless, the two bronze medals is a remarkable achievement for the 22-year-old Erigaisi, who will return home more resolute.The achievement also made Erigaisi only the second Indian male player after the legendary Viswanathan Anand to win a World Blitz medal in the 'Open category'.Earlier, Erigaisi, after stunning the likes of Carlsen and Abdusattorov to emerge sole leader with 10 points from 13 games, went through the remaining six rounds on Tuesday with steely resolve.He won four and drew two to remain sole leader with 15 points to secure a place in the semifinals.The Indian was drawn against 2021 World Rapid champion Abdusattorov, who secured a place in the last-four by the skin of the teeth, nudging Frenchman Maxime Vachier-Lagrave to fifth spot on 'best tie-break' rule after both the Grandmasters had ended on 13 points each.With Erigaisi in stunning form and having the advantage of beating Abdusattorov on Monday, the Indian was expected to go full steam.But things took a different and difficult turn for Erigaisi. He could not convert the advantage with white in the opening game, losing in 47 moves to be 0-1 down.A resurgent Abdusattorov turned things decisively his way in the second game by playing Rc5' on the 75th move and finishing the game in 83 moves.With the Uzbek needing only half-a-point to seal his place in the final, Abdusattorov settled for a quick draw with black pieces after just 33 moves despite being in a winning position, rendering the fourth game redundant.(With inputs from PTI)","World No. 1 Magnus Carlsen wins ninth World Blitz title.

With an eye on Los Angeles three years from now, a crucial Olympic cycle unfolds for India from the New Year onwards. Keeping in mind a busy, demanding 2026 for Indian sportspersons across major disciplines — culminating in the Asian Games in Aichi and Nagoya in Sept-Oct — TOI draws up a line-up of young, hungry aspirants who could be forces to reckon with this year.Hitesh Gulia is increasingly being viewed as the standard-bearer for Indian men’s boxing heading into a crucial Olympic cycle, with the Asian Games headlining the events next year. The 20-year-old 70kg boxer from Haryana emerged as India’s brightest male prospect on the international stage in 2025, delivering a season that combined consistency, composure and an unmistakable sense of arrival. Gulia stamped his authority across the World Boxing Cup circuit, with the defining moment coming at the seasonending Finals, where he clinched gold in front of the home crowd. Navigating a field stacked with experienced campaigners from Europe and Central Asia, he showcased tactical maturity beyond his years, blending sharp counter-punching with disciplined defence — reinforcing his ability to deliver under pressure.Earlier in the season, Gulia served notice of his international credentials by winning gold at the World Boxing Cup Stage I in Foz do Iguaçu, Brazil. That triumph, achieved in unfamiliar conditions and against physically imposing opponents, was widely seen as a breakthrough moment.At Stage II of the World Boxing Cup in Astana, Kazakhstan, Gulia added a silver medal to his tally, narrowly missing out on a second consecutive title. As 2026 approaches, with the Commonwealth Games and Asian Games looming large, Gulia’s upward trajectory places him firmly at the centre of India’s medal ambitions. If 2025 was about validation, the year ahead offers him a platform to translate promise into sustained excellence on the biggest stages.In 2025, Indian long jumper Shaili Singh staged a notable comeback. After setbacks that included missing qualification for the Paris Olympics and a careerthreatening injury, the 21-year-old from Jhansi returned to top form. Her comeback gained momentum at the Federation Cup in Ernakulam in April, where she produced a standout performance and drew widespread attention as she broke the meet record held by her mentor, Anju Bobby George, leaping 6.64m to better Anju’s 2002 mark of 6.59m.Ranked among the world’s top 20 under-21 long jumpers, Shaili is viewed as one of India’s strongest medal prospects for the Asian Games in 2026. Her next major goal is the national record of 6.83m set by Anju, and to qualify for the 2028 Olympics. “I’ll be looking to qualify for Los Angeles, which will be my main focus. I don’t want to make any mistakes,” she said.If 2025 belonged to any Indian boxer, it was unquestionably Jaismine Lamboria. The 57kg featherweight, competing in one of the toughest Olympic divisions, turned the year into a catalogue of triumphs and consistency that underlined her rise as India’s most distinguished female pugilist on the international stage. The 24-year-old’s crowning achievement came at the World Boxing Championships in Liverpool, where she claimed gold with a series of authoritative performances. Against a field packed with Olympic medallists and world champions, Jaismine displayed remarkable ring intelligence, controlling distance with her footwork and punishing openings with precise combinations. The title not only marked a personal milestone but also signalled India’s growing depth in women’s boxing at the elite level.Jaismine’s dominance extended to the World Boxing Cup circuit. At Astana’s Stage II, she showcased adaptability and endurance to clinch gold, thriving in a demanding environment against physically strong opponents. She capped off a stellar year by winning another gold at the World Boxing Cup Finals in Greater Noida, delivering under the pressure of expectations on home soil. What made her success even more remarkable was the category she ruled. The 57kg class, steeped in international depth, has long demanded exceptional all-round skill and adaptability. Jaismine met that challenge with a maturity that reflected her evolution. As India looks ahead to the Commonwealth Games and Asian Games in 2026, Jaismine emerges as the fulcrum of the women’s boxing programme. If 2025 was about establishing supremacy, the year ahead offers her the opportunity to convert dominance into multi-sport Games glory.Shahnawaz Khan became the 12th Indian man to clear the eight-metre barrier in long jump when he leapt 8.04m at the Indian Open, a World Athletics Bronze-level meet in Bhubaneswar in August. The effort also made him the youngest Indian to achieve the mark. With his career gaining momentum, Khan is now targeting the Asian Games and aiming to raise his level on the international stage. Known for his agility and sound technique, he has mapped out an intensive 2026 training plan to add distance, sharpen consistency, and improve competitiveness against elite fields.“At the world level, 8m doesn’t mean much. Maybe it’s a big deal because I’m a junior. But my aim is to cross the 8.50 mark. I don’t know whether I’ll be able to achieve it this year, but it is one of my main targets in the future,” said the 17-year-old boy from Madhaipur village in Uttar Pradesh’s Pratapgarh district. Progress has been steady. He won gold at the 38th National Games in February with 7.70m, then claimed another at the Junior Federation Cup in June. His tall, muscular frame gives him explosive take-off power, helping him stand out among many leaner rivals. Shahnawaz draws inspiration from his uncle Mohammad Hadees, a former national-level javelin thrower. After Shahnawaz lost his father to cancer at age 10 in 2018, Hadees became a key support. In a key move, in 2020, he helped the nephew secure admission to Panvel’s SAI centre.With stalwart PR Sreejesh calling time on his illustrious career after the Paris Olympics, the No. 16 jersey in India’s senior men’s hockey team has been retired. In the junior ranks, however, Princedeep Singh, another No. 16, has emerged as a goalkeeper who is showing promise of stepping into those giant shoes. The Pathankot-born custodian has impressed over the past year with performances that suggest he is prepared for the next step. Pushing senior goalkeepers Kishan Pathak and Suraj Karkera, Prince has shown composure and maturity beyond his years.Trained under the watchful eyes of Sreejesh — now the junior team’s chief coach — his game reflects the hallmarks of his mentor: sharp communication, sound judgment of angles, and an ability to thrive under pressure. The traits were on display at Chennai’s Junior World Cup, where Prince played a pivotal role, particularly in the penalty shootout win over Belgium that took India into the semifinals. With the senior setup in transition, 2026 could mark Princedeep’s arrival on the bigger stage.By beating PV Sindhu in the prequarterfinals of the China Open in July this year, Unnati Hooda gave indications of a change of guard in Indian badminton. It was the first time in six years that the peerless Sindhu had lost to an Indian shuttler. Of course, everyone sat up to take notice. The 18-year-old Unnati finished her maiden year on the senior Badminton World Federation circuit with a ranking of 23, five spots below Sindhu.Unnati started playing badminton at the age of eight at Rohtak’s Chhotu Ram Stadium, an arena known more for producing wrestlers. Today, she trains at the Hooda Academy in her hometown, which was established by her father, Upkar Hooda. An aggressive shuttler who likes to dictate points against her rival, Unnati played a crucial role in India’s bronzemedal finish at the World Junior Team Championships in Oct and bagged the Odisha Masters Super 100 title. She will have to shore up her net play to get the better of the best as the badminton circuit gets more demanding.“I think there should be a mix of both attacking and patient play. But I have to think when to attack and when to play patiently,” she had said. Her performances in next year’s Asian Games in Japan and the World Championships in Delhi next year will define her future career, but how busy things will get from now on for the youngster can be seen up close with the Indian Open in the capital from early January onwards.When they began saying that Indian badminton, after over a decade of being among India’s top sports, was headed for a long slump, they had not accounted for the likes of Unnati Hooda, Charishma Tamiri, and Tanvi Sharma. The first Indian to win two medals in a single edition of the World Junior Championship, the baby-faced Tanvi has emerged as India’s most promising shuttler on the junior circuit, having risen to a world ranking of 42.But 2026 will be a different kettle of fish for the 17-year-old, her prime challenge being to translate those performances to the senior circuit. Trained by renowned coach Park Tae-sang, Tanvi already showed signs of her potential when she beat former world No. 1 Nozomi Okuhara at the Syed Modi International earlier this year. A huge PV Sindhu fan, Tanvi understands the scope of improvement in her game.“I will have to work on my fitness, court endurance and net skills to go to the next level because playing at the highest level is not easy,” she says. The 17-year-old has a remarkable ability to hit sideline smashes and has a good backcourt game. But having lost three finals in 2025, the girl from Punjab will have to improve her big-match temperament if she hopes to continue her upward climb, knowing well how a nation that has learnt to follow and love badminton over the years will be looking at her to deliver.Treesa Jolly and Gayatri Gopichand didn’t have the best year in 2025, as a string of mixed results and a shoulder injury to the latter laid them low. However, by claiming the Syed Modi Open women’s doubles title — their third BWF crown towards the end of the year — the two 22-year-olds showed they are getting back to their best and are now placed 20th in the world rankings.“We are combining well, and the understanding we share is the mantra behind our success,” says Gayatri. Having been on the circuit for over four years, the fire-and-ice combo of Indian badminton faces a make-orbreak year ahead and would like to emulate the success of their compatriots on the men’s tour, Satwiksairaj Rankireddy and Chirag Shetty.As the men’s hockey team sets its sights on a hat-trick of podium finishes at the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics, a realignment of talent and strategy has become imperative. The midfield is where India’s transition could prove most defining, especially with Hockey India looking beyond Manpreet Singh, who has held fort for almost 15 years. In that context, 20-year-old Manmeet Singh and Rosan Kujur are potential long-term answers.Manmeet’s strength lies in his defensive work and ability to break opposition momentum, while Kujur, 21, offers greater ball-carrying ability. Together, they represent the kind of balanced midfield profiles that India needs. The challenge over the next cycle will be to blend experience with emerging talent — and if the early signs are any indication, the next generation appears ready to shoulder the responsibility.With the average age of the Indian shooting team shrinking by around eight years in the last decade, a teenager winning worldlevel medals has become the norm. Yet, a shooter with the spark of a youngster and the consistency of a veteran is still a delight whenever it is discovered. Haryana’s Suruchi Phogat has been one such discovery in 2025. The 18-yearold shooter made her senior international debut by winning gold in the women’s 10m air pistol at the Buenos Aires World Cup. Her first medal, a gold, came after beating double Olympic champion Jiang Ranxin of China.That Suruchi didn’t wish to be a onetime wonder is evident from the way the soft-spoken shooter won three more gold and a bronze at the World Cups. She concluded her year with another gold at the ISSF World Cup Finals in Dec. Suruchi first aspired to be a wrestler — an obvious choice for a girl who hails from Jhajjar in Haryana. Her father, Inder Singh, took voluntary retirement from the army to look after his children’s training. Suruchi’s brother is also a shooter.As 2026 approaches, the Indian pistol team will face a problem of plenty, with many contenders in the fray — especially when Olympic quotas will be at stake. With shooters like Suruchi setting the bar higher with each performance, her competitors cannot afford to put their feet up.Before November, not many had heard of Samrat Rana. The Karnal shooter made sure his name would be remembered by becoming the first-ever pistol world champion in the Olympics category with a coveted gold in the Cairo World Championships. Samrat’s 10m air pistol gold on debut was remarkable for the way he shot, nailing the toughest targets under pressure.Samrat, 20, defeated arguably the best shooter of the year, Hu Kai of China, who has won individual gold in all four editions of the World Cup this year, along with an Asian Championship gold and two mixed-team golds in World Cups. Hu concluded the year by winning gold at the World Cup Finals in Doha. Pertinently, the only silver he won this year was in the World Championships, behind Samrat by 0.3 points.Samrat, who started shooting six years ago, trains at a modest range built by his father. The youngster proved his Cairo gold wasn’t a fluke by winning bronze at the World Cup Finals. Samrat’s arrival on the international scene has strengthened India’s men’s pistol team that once was strongest courtesy of Saurabh Chaudhary and Abhishek Varma, who had ruled the world stage. Following their decline in form, Varun Tomar has been the only consistent name for India. If this young duo holds its ground, India will have a strong men’s 10m air pistol team for the Los Angeles Games in 2028.",Hitesh Gulia is increasingly being viewed as the standard-bearer for Indian men’s boxing heading into a crucial Olympic cycle.

Test cricket in 2025 saw several major moments. South Africa won the World Test Championship final against Australia at Lord’s and then went on to beat India in India. England and India played a high-profile series marked by large scores and key passages of play. The Ashes began with strong build-up, however, Australia has already secured the urn by winning the first three Tests, as the scoreline currently stands at 3-1. The yearalso had unusual moments, including Wiaan Mulder declaring while 34 runs short of Brian Lara’s 400 not out.As the year draws to a close, a number of players delivered notable performances in Test cricket. Based on those displays, Cricket Australia announced its Test XI of the year for 2025.Australia have four players in the XI despite losing the Test mace. They won nine of their 11 Tests during the year. India also have four representatives, including Ravindra Jadeja named as the 12th man. England and South Africa have two players each in the side.India’s selections include Shubman Gill, KL Rahul and Jasprit Bumrah. Cricket Australia said Jadeja narrowly missed out on a place in the XI, with England all-rounder Ben Stokes being preferred.Gill scored 983 runs in 16 innings in 2025. Rahul finished the year with 813 runs from 19 innings. Bumrah took 31 wickets in 14 innings.For the captaincy, Cricket Australia chose South Africa skipper Temba Bavuma. The other South African in the XI is off-spinner Simon Harmer. Harmer played four Tests during the year, as Keshav Maharaj featured in the WTC final instead. Harmer took 17 wickets in the two-Test series win over India, averaging 8.94, which is the best average by a visiting spinner in a series in India.","Australia have four players in the XI despite losing the Test mace.

Inside details of why Shreyas Iyer's return to cricket has been DELAYED





Bollywood and television actor Khushi Mukherjee has moved to clear the air around her recent comments involving India’s T20I captain Suryakumar Yadav , addressing the issue in an exclusive interaction with NDTV.

With the T20 World Cup less than six weeks away and the Indian squad already announced under Suryakumar Yadav’s leadership, the interpretation of her earlier remarks was viewed as potentially unsettling for the team setup.

Against this backdrop, Khushi Mukherjee’s remarks added to the buzz.

Repeatedly ignored! How Indian cricket is letting players like Sarfaraz Khan down

Ashwin wants Mumbai star as CSK regular



A groundview of Sarfaraz’s knock







MUMBAI: Sarfaraz Khan's incredible form in white-ball cricket has reignited the debate around his continuous snub from the India team, even after a string of impactful knocks and seasons in domestic cricket.For years now, Sarfaraz has developed a reputation as a ‘run-machine’ in domestic cricket - the man has scored 16 hundreds in first-class cricket and boasts an average of 63.15 and a run tally of 4,863 runs in 60 matches.However, the 28-year-old is quickly changing a perception about him that he is only good in whites. On Wednesday, Sarfaraz churned out a scintillating knock of 157 off just 75 balls against Goa in the Vijay Hazare Trophy, with his innings being laced with nine fours and as many as 14 sixes, helping Mumbai score 444 as the Shardul Thakur-led side registered an 87-run win over Goa.The middle-order batter began his ‘white-ball resurgence’ with a string of fine outings in the 2025 Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy, scoring 329 runs in seven matches with a strike-rate of 203.08 and an average of 65.80. That run included an unbeaten 100 off just 47 balls against Assam and 73 off 22 balls against Rajasthan. He cracked an 18-ball fifty against Haryana - the fastest-ever for Mumbai in SMAT, before breaking his own record with a 15-ball half-century against Rajasthan.Coming down heavily on the national selectors and the team management for having ignored Sarfaraz over the years, former India skipper Dilip Vengsarkar told TOI, ""You know, the thing is, it's really baffing for me that why he's not pick in any format for India, when he has done well so consistently, even for India also when he got an opportunity. I watched him and (Devdutt) Padikkal batting together against England in Dharamshala (in the fifth and final Test of that series in Jan-Feb 2024). It was a crucial session. They batted beautifully and forged together an important partnership (97 in 132 balls for the fourth wicket), which ultimately helped India win the Test match (Sarfaraz made 56, while Padikkal scored 65 as India won by an innings & 64 runs).""Vengsarkar, a former India chief selector, felt it was a ""shame that a talent like Sarfaraz ""has been ignored and neglected. ""And after that (home series against England), he didn't get an opportunity (to play another Test). Of course, he was on the tour of Australia (the 2024-25 Border-Gavaskar Trophy), but he wasn't given a chance at all.and that really baffles me, because he's a good enough player to play in all formats of the game. Such a talent has been ignored and neglected. It's a real shame!,"" Vengsarkar thundered.Sarfaraz has played for India in six Tests, scoring 371 runs at an average of 37.10 and strike rate of 74.94, with 150 being his highest score.Complimenting the Mumbai batter's ability to adapt to different formats so easily and terming him as a ""match-winner,"" Vengsarkar said, ""Basically, he's a match-winner. The beauty of his batting or his mental strength that he can easily adapt to different formats of the game, which is such an important and a great quality of his. I mean, yesterday, Mumbai lost their top-order against Goa, and then he churned out a brilliant knock, which paved the way for Mumbai's win. It was a match-winning innings. And if you don't pick match-winners, you can't blame anybody else, but yourself.""Pleased a punch with his son's supreme white-ball touch, Sarfaraz's father-cum-coach Naushad Khan told this paper, ""It's great to see Sarfaraz doing so well in white-ball cricket. He's in a different zone currently. He's fit both mentally and physically. I hope that he keeps performing like this in future too.""Meanwhile, India's off-spin great Ravichandran Ashwin wants the in-form Sarfaraz to be a regular for CSK in IPL-2026. Sarfaraz was given a lifeline in the IPL-2026 auction when CSK picked him up for his base price of Rs 75 lakh. Following his blazing knock against Goa, Ashwin batted for the Mumbai batter to be a part of CSK's starting XII in the upcoming IPL season.The former spinner said that Sarfaraz is ""not knocking down, but breaking open"" the doors for India selection and that CSK should be looking at ""riding his purple patch"" in the upcoming season.""100*(47), 52(40), 64(25), 73(22) in the SMAT. That form's transitioned seamlessly into the Hazare with scores of 55(49) followed by a blistering 157(75) today with 14 sixes. It's particularly impressive how he murders spin in the middle overs with his sweeps and slog sweeps. 'Avan kadhava thattala, idichi odachitu irukaan.' (He is not knocking on the door, he is breaking it open ) CSK should look at riding his purple patch by slotting him into the Playing XII surely? A genuine problem of plenty with the bat for the men in yellove this season! Can't wait for IPL 2026!"" tweeted Ashwin.Former India selector and ex-Mumbai chief selector Salil Ankola has seen Sarfaraz's growth as a batter from close quarters. ""A lot of people had this notion that Sarfaraz can't play white-ball cricket. However, he has come of age now. It's a big hundred (175 vs Goa), and not a 'small hundred.' It was a fabulous knock. I'm very happy for him. I hope that his form continues in white-ball cricket too,"" Ankola told this paper.Former Rajasthan wicketkeeper Rohit Jalani, who was present at the Jaipuria cricket ground in Jaipur, where he runs his cricket academy, when Sarfaraz unleashed his blitzkrieg against Goa, was left in awe after witnessing the 28-year-old's fireworks with the bat. ""His batting was simply superb. He is batting at a different level these days. In the north of India, the ball moves around for an hour in the morning, but Sarfaraz grafted out that period, and then put the pressure back on the bowlers. The selectors must take note of his consistently fine performance in white-ball cricket too. He shouldn't be categorized as just a red-ball player. He must get an opportunity. You can't judge him about where he stands without giving him a chance. If you picked Ishan Kishan in India's T20 World Cup team on the basis of his splendid form in domestic cricket, the same rule must apply to Sarfaraz as well,"" Jalani felt.Praising Sarfaraz for improving his fitness- the Mumbaikar has reduced his weight drastically - Jalani said, ""Sarfaraz has worked hard on his fitness too, and that shows with the way he scored 150-plus against Goa. If he's scoring centuries, then that's all the fitness that you need from him.""","Sarfaraz Khan scored 157 off just 75 balls against Goa in Vijay Hazare Trophy. Former India skipper Dilip Vengsarkar says Sarfaraz is a'match-winner' Khan has played for India in six Tests, scoring 371 runs at 37.10.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126275611,imgsize-22478,width-400,resizemode-4/mnh-23.jpg"

Rishabh Pant press conference: On Shubman Gill injury, India Playing XI, pitch and more





India wicketkeeper Rishabh Pant ’s poor run with the bat, along with failures from Delhi’s senior batters, brought an end to the team’s unbeaten streak as Odisha registered a 79-run win in a fourth-round Group D match of the Vijay Hazare Trophy on Wednesday.With national selectors set to name the squad for the five-match ODI series against New Zealand in the first week of January, attention was firmly on Delhi captain Pant. However, the India batter managed only 24 as Delhi’s much-talked-about batting line-up collapsed, folding for 193 in 43.3 overs while chasing Odisha’s 272 for 8, a target that looked within reach.Delhi’s campaign this season has largely depended on one strong batting effort in each game. The absence of such a performance on Wednesday not only cost them the match but also their position at the top of the points table, a setback that could affect them later in the tournament.Odisha moved to the top of the table with 12 points and a strong net run rate. Delhi also have 12 points but slipped to fourth place, with Railways and Haryana moving above them on net run rate.This was the first time this season that Delhi failed to cross the 200-run mark.Earlier, the target had looked routine when Virat Kohli scored a century against Andhra in the opening match, and opener Priyansh Arya struck 78 against Saurashtra in the previous game.Pant, who had scores of 5, 70 and 22 earlier in the tournament, could add only 24 from 28 balls before being dismissed by pacer Debabrata Pradhan, who finished with figures of 3 for 28. Pradhan, along with young right-arm pacer Sambit Baral (3/34), played a key role in triggering Delhi’s collapse.Odisha’s total was anchored by captain Biplab Samantray , who scored 72 off 74 balls after the team lost three wickets before crossing 100. Contributions from the lower order added useful runs and tested the Delhi bowlers, including India players Navdeep Saini and Nitish Rana. Off-spinner Hrithik Shokeen was the pick of the Delhi bowlers with figures of 4 for 27 from his 10 overs.Delhi’s chase got off to a poor start as openers Priyansh Arya and Sarthak Ranjan were dismissed for single-digit scores, leaving the side at 6 for 2. Pant’s wicket reduced Delhi to 50 for 3 in the 11th over, and the situation soon worsened to 55 for 5.From there, a comeback was unlikely, though Harsh Tyagi (43) and Hrithik Shokeen (32) showed resistance and delayed the end with some determined batting.","Odisha move to the top of the table with 12 points and a strong net run rate.

The Indian men’s cricket team is set for an intense and demanding 2026, with major bilateral series and global tournaments packed into a relentless calendar. After a year of contrasts in 2025, the focus now shifts to sustaining momentum and correcting past shortcomings.While 2025 delivered a significant setback in Test cricket with a heavy home series defeat against South Africa, India were outstanding in white-ball formats. The Champions Trophy triumph and their dominance in T20 internationals reinforced the side’s strength and depth in limited-overs cricket.The key challenge in 2026 will be translating that T20I dominance into success at the home T20 World Cup. Expectations will be sky-high, and anything short of a title defence is unlikely to satisfy fans. Surrounding the World Cup is a busy schedule that sees India hosting multiple teams and touring overseas, with little room for error or extended recovery.The year begins with New Zealand touring India, followed by the T20 World Cup at home, a full IPL season, and overseas assignments in England, Sri Lanka and New Zealand. Below is a detailed look at India’s confirmed schedule for 2026.","The Indian men’s cricket team is set for an intense and demanding 2026, with major bilateral series and global tournaments packed into a relentless calendar.

"INDW vs SLW: A perfect score line, but fineprint matters",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/indw-vs-slw-a-perfect-score-line-but-fineprint-matters/articleshow/126271918.cms,"Photo/Agencies





Thiruvananthapuram: India’s 5–0 sweep of Sri Lanka in the T20I series read like a statement of dominance, but the margins within that scoreline told a more layered story. The hosts were clearly superior for most of the contest, yet the final two games offered reminders that this Indian side, for all its progress, remains a work in refinement.At the heart of India’s authority was an opening partnership that continues to redefine the tone of women’s T20 cricket.Sri Lanka coach Rumesh Ratnanayake summed it up memorably, describing Smriti Mandhana as “the closest thing to David Gower” for her timing and grace.The series also marked a significant personal milestone for Mandhana, who became only the fourth Indian woman to cross 10,000 international runs across formats — a testament to her consistency and longevity at the top level. Her partner, Shafali Verma, channels Virender Sehwag: fearless and ultra-aggressive. Together, they dominate the powerplay, unsettle bowlers early, and provide India with a platform few teams can match.Beyond the top order, India’s depth was on full display. Runs came from across the lineup, reflecting a unit no longer reliant on isolated brilliance. Even Arundhati Reddy and Amanjot Kaur showed they can use the long handle, as the final match underlined.With the ball, spinners and seamers worked in sync, striking early and strangling Sri Lanka through the middle overs.The tone shifted slightly in the last two matches. Sri Lanka pushed harder, probing India’s weaknesses and capitalising on uncharacteristic lapses in the field.Dropped catches at key moments offered second chances, prolonging contests India might otherwise have closed out clinically. Fielding — an area India have repeatedly targeted for improvement — remains a concern, one likely to be tested further against stronger opposition.All-rounder Deepti Sharma was candid. “We were tested in the final two T20s,” she admitted, acknowledging the missed chances. Still, she stressed perspective over panic. With the T20 World Cup in England six months away, India are resisting long-term fixation. “We will take one match and one series at a time. We’re confident,” she said, striking a measured balance between satisfaction and caution.One of the most encouraging takeaways was the emergence of young left-arm spinner Vaishnavi Sharma from the U-19 ranks. Trusted in high-pressure phases, she showed composure beyond her years, particularly in the powerplay. Her ability to attack the stumps added a fresh dimension to India’s plans. “She is so young and shows no pressure whatsoever,” Deepti noted, underlining the leadership’s faith in her.Vaishnavi’s rise, alongside seamless transitions from bench to XI, speaks volumes about India’s evolving T20 structure. The pieces of the puzzle are coming together, with a blend of experience , youth, flexibility, and tactical clarity.","India beat Sri Lanka 5-0 in the T20I series.

A moment from the Perth Scorchers vs Sydney Thunder match went viral on Tuesday, December 30, after some Scorchers players were involved in an unusual incident before the game.Laurie Evans, Ashton Agar, Aaron Hardie and Mahli Beardman were travelling to the stadium in an Uber when the car broke down on the way. With the vehicle coming to a halt, the four players stepped out and pushed it in an effort to restart it, before getting back in and continuing their journey to the ground.A video of the incident spread widely on social media, and commentators later confirmed the episode with one of the players during the live broadcast. The incident soon became a topic of discussion during the Big Bash League match.Details of the episode emerged during the telecast, with middle-order batter Laurie Evans later speaking about it in a light-hearted way, prompting reactions from both fans and commentators.""We took an Uber but unfortunately the Uber broke down, so we have to give them a hand to the side of the road. It was a different way of arriving but it was good fun. There was four of us. There was me, Hards, Mahli, and Ags,"" Evans told the commentators when asked about the incident.The unexpected delay did not affect the Scorchers on the field. Batting first, they posted a total of 202 runs, with Ashton Turner scoring an unbeaten 99. Turner missed out on a hundred after the last recognised batter, Ashton Agar, was out while trying to hit a big shot over midwicket.The Scorchers followed it up with a strong bowling effort, dismissing the Thunder for 131 in 17.3 overs. The win moved Perth to third place on the Big Bash League points table, behind Melbourne Stars and Hobart Hurricanes.","Perth Scorchers vs Sydney Thunder players involved in unusual incident.

Smriti Mandhana opens up on 'love', World Cup win and more





Former India opener Aakash Chopra has backed Delhi Capitals to finally go all the way in the 2026 Women’s Premier League, while also tipping Royal Challengers Bengaluru captain Smriti Mandhana to dominate the batting charts this season.Chopra believes DC’s consistent presence in the finals over the last three editions makes them strong favourites under new skipper Jemimah Rodrigues. Speaking on JioStar, he said, “I think Delhi Capitals will win, this time around. They have put together a very good squad and they have reached the finals all three times. Let them win it once.”While predicting the title winner, Chopra also turned his attention to the Orange Cap race and placed Mandhana at the top of his list. The RCB opener has been a key figure for her side and Chopra feels this could be her standout season with the bat. “I think it could be RCB captain, Smriti Mandhana, to score the most number of runs this WPL season. Smriti Mandhana might be the frontrunner in the race to win the Orange Cap and she might even win it,” he said.He added that Mandhana may not be the only opener making a strong push for the top run-scorer award. Delhi Capitals’ aggressive starter Shafali Verma also earned Chopra’s backing.“Alongside her, I feel, Shafali Verma, who will open for the Delhi Capitals, could be a strong contender as well.”Chopra also shared his picks for the major individual honours, highlighting Deepti Sharma ’s all-round impact. He feels the India star is primed to continue her remarkable run in the league. “I think Deepti Sharma can register a hat-trick of winning the Player of the Tournament award. The form she is in currently, she has been unstoppable and I also think that since she has started doing well in the WPL, there has been a significant improvement in her overall game,” he said.Looking at the Emerging Player award, Chopra named young spinner Shree Charani as his favourite. “So, this could be her season again. I think Shree Charani might win the Emerging Player of the Season award. She had a fantastic World Cup and I feel she will be the tournament's best spinner.”Chopra also gave his prediction for the opening clash of the season between Mumbai Indians and Royal Challengers Bengaluru at the DY Patil Stadium in Navi Mumbai on January 9. “I will go with Mumbai Indians for this clash.

Real Madrid have confirmed that Kylian Mbappe has suffered a sprain to his left knee, dealing a significant setback to their pursuit of La Liga leaders Barcelona. The club issued a statement on Wednesday revealing the diagnosis following medical tests, adding that his condition will be monitored over the coming days.The Spanish giants did not provide a clear timeline for the 27-year-old forward’s return. However, a source close to the France international told AFP that Mbappe is expected to be sidelined for a minimum of three weeks.Mbappe’s injury places his availability in serious doubt for Sunday’s home league fixture against Real Betis, Madrid’s first match after the winter break. Carlo Ancelotti’s side currently sit four points behind Barcelona in the title race. The forward could also miss the Spanish Super Cup semi-final against Atletico Madrid in Saudi Arabia on January 8, along with a league encounter against Levante and a Champions League meeting with his former club Monaco.Real Madrid have not disclosed when or how the injury occurred. Mbappe was involved in full training with the squad on Tuesday before undergoing an MRI scan the following day.The setback comes after an exceptional year for Mbappe. In 2025, he matched Cristiano Ronaldo ’s club record of 59 goals in a calendar year and has often been the driving force behind Madrid’s performances, easing pressure on head coach Xabi Alonso.Since arriving on a free transfer from Paris Saint-Germain 18 months ago, Mbappe has scored 73 goals in 83 appearances for the club.He finished last season as La Liga’s leading scorer with 31 goals, four more than Barcelona striker Robert Lewandowski . This campaign, he already has 18 league goals and holds a seven-goal advantage over Barcelona’s Ferran Torres.Mbappe’s absence further compounds Real Madrid’s injury concerns.

In this sabre fencing, Paris employed the slashing technique, cutting off the Frenchman’s salary that included a so-called ‘ethics bonus’. Mad in Madrid, Mbappe’s riposte was of the legal kind. After the back and forth, the court ruled that the former employers pay up unpaid wages of 60m euros. Back in Spain, Mbappe earned some Real love from the Bernabeu faithful, after scoring 59 goals in 59 games, equaling his ‘hero’ Cristiano Ronaldo’s record, the most in a calendar year.

La Liga president Javier Tebas’ plan to ‘host’ a league match between Barcelona and Villarreal in Miami 7,500-km away from the shores of Spain was cancelled. The league had also chartered planes to take around 2,000 to 3,000 Villarreal fans to the US of A. In Oct, there were league-wide protests, stopping active play to express displeasure. Ultimately, Tebas had to bow down as organisers pulled out. Last week, a high-profile plan to stage a Serie A match -- AC Milan vs. Como -- in Perth was scrapped.DIAMONDS ARE FOREVEROne of the most viral pics of 2025 was of Georgina Rodriguez’s oversized diamond engagement ring reported to be valued between $2 and 5m, the kind of flashy display that one can associate with her fiancé Cristiano Ronaldo.

Ryan Rickelton press conference: 'Been tough last couple of months mentally in India'

Florian Wirtz's first Liverpool goal fired the Reds into the Premier League 's top four despite an unconvincing 2-1 win over Wolves on a day both clubs paid tribute to Diogo Jota . Jota, who was killed in a car accident alongside his brother Andre Silva in July, won four trophies after joining Liverpool from Wolves in 2020.Two of his children led the teams out as mascots, while his wife Rute Cardoso watched on from the sidelines.Both sets of fans sang chants in Jota's name in the 18th and 20th minutes -- the shirt numbers he wore during his spells at Molineux and Anfield respectively.""After the tragedy happened until now, I have seen so many special moments -- where the fans remembered him or our players conducted themselves unbelievably in the circumstances,"" said Liverpool boss Arne Slot.""Not only our fans but the fans of away teams have shown the respect both Diogo and his brother deserved. It was special to see his children being the mascot and how emotional it was before the game and then in the 20th minute.""On the field, both clubs have suffered this season with Wolves staring down the barrel of relegation after taking just two points from their opening 18 league games.Liverpool's form has improved of late and Wirtz is beginning to show flashes of the brilliance that lured the English champions into paying Bayer Leverkusen £100 million ($135 million) for the German international.The 22-year-old registered his first Premier League assist last weekend for a goal that came at some cost to Liverpool as Alexander Isak suffered a broken leg in opening the scoring against Tottenham.Shorn of the most expensive player in English football history for the coming months, there is even more pressure on Wirtz to deliver on his hefty price tag.""He's been very important for us throughout the season. But in football it is about results, you are mainly judged on results or on goals and assists,"" added Slot.""I think today he showed much more than just the goal he scored; he was special for us in many parts of the game.""Wirtz finally opened his account in his 23rd Liverpool appearance by prodding home Hugo Ekitike's pass to double the home side's lead.Just 90 seconds earlier, Liverpool had made the breakthrough when Ryan Gravenberch slammed in Jeremie Frimpong's cross.Yet, even with a 2-0 half-time lead against a side on course to become the worst in Premier League history, Slot could not relax.Santiago Bueno exposed Liverpool's frailty from set-pieces to pull a goal back just six minutes into the second half.Slot's men have made a habit of late collapses at Leeds and Tottenham in recent weeks and needed a perfectly-timed tackle from Conor Bradley to deny Jhon Arias a late equaliser.","Liverpool beat Wolves 2-1 in Premier League.

In contrast, the darkness around Indian football seems to have grown deeper, unfathomable, with no light at the end of the tunnel.The year gone by has seen All India Football Federation officials spend more time making rounds of the courts than the national team spent on the field.It might delight a research scholar to know that AIFF has presented itself to the Supreme Court 16 times and counting.The national team has played only 12 matches. None of it, though, will bring cheer to the fans.Never since Independence has Indian football slipped into such a deep abyss. For the first time since 1996, when the national league was begun by then-AIFF president Priya Ranjan Das Munshi, it has stalled.One can say with a heavy heart that the league is an orphan now.The sponsorship ran out. The new occupants of Football House, who took charge in 2022, were aware of the matter. But the negotiations just refused to yield any money, assurance, or hope.Since 2010, the AIFF received Rs 50 crore every year from Football Sports Development Limited (FSDL), a Reliance Industries subsidiary, as part of an agreement. The 15-year contract ran out on Dec 8.It was obvious to all, except those in Football House, that no one wants to waste money to keep Indian football – once called a sleeping giant by Sepp Blatter just over a decade and a half ago – alive and awake.Till reports last came in, the AIFF plans to start the elite league around Feb 7-8 after presenting a 20-year plan to the ISL clubs. In accordance with the constitution, the league will be owned and operated by the AIFF and will “implement the principles of promotion and relegation.”“I am convinced we can start the league and then work out a long-term solution,” said IFA secy Anirban Dutta, a member of the committee to resolve the ISL crisis.All year, the stakeholders went into hair-splitting debates and nuanced offerings but the outcome, sadly, has been zero. Even a few clubs had temporarily stopped paying salaries to the players. There has been a frustrating sense of ennui.Last heard, there was some warmth shown by the beleaguered clubs towards the AIFF’s proposals. The format for a truncated league is expected to be confirmed in the year’s final week.Add to it the dismal performance of the national team. Hours after India lost to Bangladesh in their last Asian Cup qualification engagement, Haiti’s ticket to the World Cup sent euphoric shock waves around the world. To watch India’s matches this year, under coaches Manolo Marquez and Khalid Jamil, was like visiting the dentist with a severe toothache.The Indian senior men’s team failed to qualify for the 2027 AFC Asian Cup, which means no competitive football until at least Nov 2027. That is nearly three years without meaningful matches. One wonders what will be Khalid Jamil’s work schedule now?One question keeps haunting, though. If Curacao are able to hire the services of a world-renowned coach like Advocaat, why could India, claimed to be the fourth-largest economy in the world, never reach beyond the Manolos and the Stimacs and the Koevermans? One can keep waiting for an answer but there will only be silence from the All India Football Federation.Following some creditable performances against Bahrain (2-0) and Brunei (6-0), U-23 coach Naushad Moosa got stuck in Doha. Not one to be easily perturbed, even by the sudden bombing of the Qatari capital, Moosa showered rousing praise on the boys. But his enthusiasm was laced with bleakness.“What’s next for the boys? They will go back to their clubs and warm the bench. They won’t be getting any minutes,” he had said in Sept. With the U-17s, Bibiano Fernandes also made headlines by helping the boys cross the Asian Cup qualification hurdles.Repeating himself, Moosa confirmed his apprehensions in Dec. “Nothing is happening. The players too are sadly cooling their heels.” And we couldn’t but recall the days not too long ago, when the AIFF had to put a cap of 45 matches on the national team players.One may point out that these are silver linings. If so, then why can’t Manolo or Jamil do without Sunil Chhetri , India’s weather-beaten warhorse who is past 40? The striker had to break his retirement vows and don the India shirt again, confirming that Indian football’s cupboard is starkly bare.The year 2025 will stay in memory as the lowest point in Indian football.LEAGUE UNCERTAINTY: It’s the end of December, half-time in most football seasons, a time when clubs redraw their strategies, depending on the progress they’ve made in the league. This year, nothing. Indian football has never seen anything like this. There’s no word on the top tier ISL or the I-League, because the AIFF has simply failed to find a commercial partner. Everything’s at a standstill: clubs have paused first team operations, players have stopped training and many foreigners plan to move elsewhere once the transfer window opens on Jan 1. One club has told players they will have to “forego salaries” for months and they’d be “happy to resume payments” only from the date of restart.CAMPS WITHOUT PLAYERS: National team camps often kicked off without half the players. Coach Khalid Jamil wanted more time with the boys, but clubs refused to release players outside the FIFA international windows. It was no different for U-23 assignments. The trust deficit between the two parties has grown so much that Mohun Bagan SG, who have the maximum players at national camps, even accused the federation of negligence over the handling of their captain Subhashish Bose.MONUMENTAL FAILURE: In the 15 months between May 2024 and August 2025, the national team had three coaches — Igor Stimac, Manolo Marquez, Khalid Jamil — none of whom could ensure that India makes it to the AFC Asian Cup, the country’s first failure since the tournament was expanded to accommodate 24 teams. In the final round of qualifiers, India were the highest-ranked side but finished at the bottom, unable to register a single win and in five matches, scoring just twice. The defeat to Bangladesh in Dhaka, the first in 22 years, rankled the most.THE BIG EXIT: The City Football Group’s exit from Mumbai City FC was probably the biggest reflection of the mess that is Indian football. CFG, the world’s leading private owner and operator of 13 clubs, including Manchester City, had joined hands with Mumbai City with much fanfare. Their decision to divest its shareholding in the club is a huge blow. The reason: “CFG made this decision following a comprehensive commercial review and in light of the ongoing uncertainty surrounding the future of the Indian Super League (ISL). ”BUT, A SILVER LINING: The women’s team provided joy in an otherwise grim state. The senior team defied the odds to defeat World Cuppers Thailand and qualify for the AFC Asian Cup. The U-17 and U-20 teams also left India with three continental competitions to play for in the opening months of 2026. At club level, East Bengal’s SAFF Club Championship triumph and a first group stage win in the AFC Women’s Champions League brought cheer.UNDER MANOLO MARQUEZUNDER KHALID JAMILIndia won Bronze Medal at CAFA Nations CupTOTAL MATCHES: 11India Won: 3India Lost: 5Drawn: 3Goals Scored: 8Goals Conceded: 12","Indian football has slipped into such a deep abyss.

Rayan Cherki steals the show as Manchester City edge Nottingham Forest to go top of the Premier League,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/top-stories/rayan-cherki-steals-the-show-as-manchester-city-edge-nottingham-forest-to-go-top-of-the-premier-league/articleshow/126206283.cms,"Manchester City's Rayan Cherki celebrates with Erling Haaland (Barrington Coombs/PA via AP)

Rayan Cherki delivered another decisive statement of his growing influence at Manchester City as his late strike secured a 2-1 Premier League win over Nottingham Forest and lifted Pep Guardiola’s side to the top of the table on Saturday.The France international was at the heart of everything City did well at the City Ground. After setting up Tijjani Reijnders for the opening goal early in the second half, Cherki returned in the closing stages to fire home the winner, capping a standout display that underlined his importance to City’s title push.City had to weather sustained pressure from Forest, who matched Guardiola’s men for large spells and were level soon after falling behind. Omari Hutchinson, scoring his first goal for the club, punished a rare City mistake to bring the home side back into the contest and briefly threaten another memorable result against the champions.Guardiola’s team eventually found a way through, extending their winning run to eight matches in all competitions and six straight league victories. The result moved City one point clear of Arsenal, although the Gunners could reclaim top spot later in the day with a home win over Brighton.Before kick-off, Forest paid tribute to club legend John Robertson, who passed away on Christmas Day at the age of 72. The former Scotland winger was a central figure in Forest’s back-to-back European Cup triumphs in 1979 and 1980, and his flair and end product were fondly remembered by the City Ground crowd.Cherki, who joined City from Lyon in the summer, appears to share that same blend of creativity and cutting edge. At just 22, he has quickly become a key figure in Guardiola’s side and, should City edge Arsenal to the title, his contribution is likely to be pivotal.Guardiola had set a stern tone over the festive period, warning his players against excess and making it clear that fitness standards would not be compromised. He even cancelled a planned rest day after last weekend’s win over West Ham. When asked about his squad’s condition, Guardiola joked that he was the only one who had put on weight.Despite that discipline, City looked flat before the break and Forest had the better chances. Morgan Gibbs-White went close after meeting a Callum Hudson-Odoi cross, while City struggled to impose themselves. Erling Haaland, who has 19 league goals by Christmas, the joint-most at this stage in Premier League history, was largely kept quiet.The visitors finally found their rhythm just after the interval. Cherki drifted inside and slipped a clever pass to Reijnders, who finished calmly from 12 yards for City’s first shot on target. Cherki then tested goalkeeper John Victor with a fierce effort moments later.Forest responded swiftly. Reijnders lost possession near his own area, allowing Gibbs-White to release Igor Jesus, whose cross was drilled home by Hutchinson from close range. With City wobbling, Neco Williams forced Gianluigi Donnarumma into a save before Nicolo Savona blazed over from the rebound.The decisive moment arrived in the 83rd minute. A loose ball fell to Cherki just inside the box and the Frenchman lashed an unstoppable finish past Victor. He celebrated by mimicking Haaland’s trademark calm pose in front of the travelling supporters.It was a fitting end to a performance that highlighted why Cherki is fast becoming one of Guardiola’s most trusted match-winners as City continue their relentless pursuit of another Premier League crown.",Manchester City beat Nottingham Forest 2-1 at the City Ground. Tijjani Reijnders opened the scoring before Omari Hutchinson equalised. Rayan Cherki scored the winner in the 83rd minute.

The All India Football Federation (AIFF) on Friday proposed a new structure for the Indian Super League (ISL), under which the league would be owned and operated by the national body in accordance with its new constitution for the next 20 seasons.According to the new proposal the AIFF formulated after a meeting with the ISL clubs, the league will implement a promotion and relegation system from the upcoming season. Each season will be calculated from June 1 to May 31 of the next year.""We have sent the proposal to the clubs, we have to wait for their response in the next couple of days before finalising our plan,"" an AIFF source told PTI.""Let the clubs respond, we will try to find a solution after hearing them.""It is expected that the AIFF and the clubs will have two more rounds of meetings -- one on Sunday and the other on Monday.If all goes well, the ISL season may start in the first week of February, according to the source.According to the proposal, the ISL will have a predetermined 'Central Operational Budget' for every year that would come from yearly contributions from all 'revenue share holders' proportionate to their revenue share in the league.""This would be known as the 'League Membership Contribution'. Any operational expenses required for the league to be conducted and for clubs to comply with their applicable licensing criteria with the addition of prize money distribution would be capped and borne out of this budget,"" the proposal said.""Governance would be overseen by a Board that would be empowered by the AIFF general body with certain operational autonomy over commercial matters of the League. The jurisdiction of the board would be limited to the utilisation of unrestricted funds within the yearly operational budget earmarked for the same.""Each club, under the proposal, will pay the AIFF a 'standard participating fee' of Rs 1 crore a year at the beginning of the season. This would, however, be independent of any calculations of the 'Central Operating Expenditure'.""This amount would be fully reimbursable from the central revenue prior to distribution of 'Net Revenue'. The total participation fee for all clubs would be put at 20% of the 'central operational budget' of the League. In case the Board decides to raise the 'central operational budget' by 10% in the future, the 'standard participation fee' would proportionately increase.""Any profit, or savings from the operational budget, will be distributed equally amongst all revenue shareholders in proportion to the respective revenue shares.On December 20, a proposal from 10 ISL clubs for ""perpetual"" operational and commercial ownership of the country's top-tier competition failed to get the approval of the AIFF's General Body, which formed a committee to look into the matter.The AIFF panel was tasked with holding discussions with representatives of five clubs - Chennaiyin FC, Mumbai City FC, Delhi Sporting Club, NorthEast United FC and Mohun Bagan Super Giant from December 22 to 29.Under the AIFF's proposal, the total outlay of the first season of the ISL will be Rs 70 crore with the AIFF's revenue share pegged at 10 per cent (that is Rs 7 crore) in the first season, while 50 per cent (Rs 35 crore) will come from the clubs -- 14 as of now unless there is any pull out.But interestingly, a revenue share of 30 per cent has been reserved for a potential commercial partner. The AIFF is yet to get a commercial partner as it did not receive any bid after a tender was floated on the supervision of a Supreme Court-appointed committee under a retired SC judge.Though the AIFF has included a 30 per cent revenue share for a potential commercial partner in the proposal, it is learnt that since the number of matches this season could be less than earlier years, the ISL can be run with a 'central operating budget' of less than the proposed Rs 70 crore.",The All India Football Federation (AIFF) has proposed a new structure for the Indian Super League (ISL) The league would be owned and operated by the national body in accordance with its new constitution for the next 20 seasons.

RABAT: Organisers at the Africa Cup of Nations in Morocco are allowing supporters in for free after kick-off in matches where stadiums are not full, a Confederation of African Football source told AFP.The Group F game between Cameroon and Gabon on Wednesday in Agadir kicked off in front of almost empty stands but the ground filled up significantly over the course of the first half despite incessant rain.The official attendance was later announced as 35,200 inside a venue which can hold over 45,000.There have been similar scenes at numerous matches across the opening days of the competition, even leading to confusion over the attendance figures themselves.The crowd at Tuesday's Group D encounter between the Democratic Republic of Congo and Benin at Rabat's Al Medina Stadium -- which filled up considerably over the course of the game -- was initially announced as 6,703 before later being corrected to 13,073.The CAF source indicated that organisers, in agreement with African football's governing body, were opening stands around 20 minutes into games to allow fans gathered outside to enter without paying.Filling stadiums is an important issue for Cup of Nations organisers in Morocco, for which a successful hosting of the tournament is key as it builds towards the 2030 World Cup to be jointly held in the North African country, Spain and Portugal.CAF's official ticketing platform on Thursday showed seats available for almost all remaining group matches for prices starting at 100 dirhams ($10.96).The only matches shown as sell-outs were hosts Morocco's games against Mali on Friday and Zambia on Monday, as well as Algeria against Burkina Faso on Sunday and Algeria versus Equatorial Guinea next Wednesday.","Africa Cup of Nations organisers are allowing supporters in for free after kick- off in matches where stadiums are not full.

Trevon Diggs Green Bay Packers reunion adds urgency to a thin secondary







Trevon Diggs and Green Bay Packers was not a headline many expected to see this week, yet it now defines a pivotal turn for both player and franchise. A day after Dallas moved on from the former All-Pro cornerback, Green Bay stepped in with urgency. The claim signals more than a routine roster move. It reflects belief. It also reflects need, as injuries have torn through the Packers secondary at the worst possible time. For Diggs, it opens a door to reclaim relevance after two turbulent seasons marked by setbacks, scrutiny, and silence.The timing matters. Green Bay is entering the postseason with depth stretched thin and confidence under strain. Dallas, meanwhile, chose closure after weeks of tension that never fully played out in public. Diggs arrives without fanfare but with history. His past dominance still lingers in league memory, even as doubts shadow his durability. This move blends risk with opportunity, the kind teams embrace when margins are slim and upside still whispers loudly.At his peak, Diggs changed games. In 2021, he led the NFL with 11 interceptions and became one of the league’s most disruptive corners. A Pro Bowl followed that season and again the next year.Then came the injuries. Two knee surgeries slowed his rise and altered his rhythm. This season offered only flashes. Six games ended abruptly after a concussion suffered at home, later explained as an accident while installing a TV. Even after clearing protocol, knee concerns kept him sidelined longer than expected.Dallas eventually brought him back when DaRon Bland went down. Diggs played against the Chargers and Commanders, yet the trust seemed fragile. Coach Brian Schottenheimer maintained that the release stemmed from multiple issues, not one event. Still, reports pointed to a Christmas Day disagreement when Diggs asked to stay back in Washington after the game. The request was denied. Days later, he was gone.Green Bay now becomes the reset point. The Packers are missing Nate Hobbs, likely out with a knee injury, and Kamal Hadden, lost for the year. That reality makes Diggs more than a flyer. It makes him a necessity. The move also reconnects him with Micah Parsons, his former Dallas teammate and close friend, now rehabbing an ACL injury in Green Bay. Parsons marked the moment simply, tweeting, “We are back,” a line that carries weight beyond celebration.For the Packers, this is about survival and upside. For Diggs, it is about trust, health, and proving that his best football still lives ahead, not behind.Also Read: Patriots coach Mike Vrabel finally addresses Stefon Diggs and Christian Barmore allegations, sending a clear message to fans",Trevon Diggs joins the Green Bay Packers after being released by the Dallas Cowboys.

Mike Vrabel addresses Stefon Diggs and Christian Barmore allegations with calm resolve







Mike Vrabel addresses Stefon Diggs and Christian Barmore allegations at a moment when the New England Patriots are balancing winning football with uncomfortable headlines. As the regular season nears its end, the focus inside the building is sharp, even as serious accusations swirl around two key players. For a team chasing consistency and credibility, the challenge is not just preparation for Sunday, but managing uncertainty without letting it fracture the locker room.Inside Foxborough, the message from the head coach was calm, firm, and deliberate. Vrabel chose not to dramatize the situation or sidestep it. Instead, he framed it as part of the modern NFL landscape, where teams often face issues far beyond the field. His approach suggested trust in process, patience, and accountability, all while keeping football at the center.When Vrabel met reporters on Wednesday, his tone reflected experience rather than alarm. “I would say not disappointing at all. These are allegations,” Vrabel said, via Graff. “It’s things that we have to handle. Every day there’s distractions. Some are smaller than others. Confident that we’ll focus on the Dolphins and those two individuals…will be able to handle the ongoing legal process.”He reinforced that stance moments later, refusing to speculate or rush judgment. “It's an ongoing legal matter, and these are allegations,” Vrabel continued. “I don't think we have to jump to any sort of conclusions right now and [we'll] let the process take its toll.”Behind the scenes, the Patriots have stayed in contact with the league and monitored developments closely. Vrabel made clear the team was not blindsided. “We always want to gather more information, but… we've been aware of these allegations, yesterday and today wasn't the first that we've heard about them, and [we've] tried to do everything in accordance with the league policy, making sure we're in compliance with the league,” Vrabel said, via WCVB.Importantly, availability has not changed. Barmore’s absence was illness related, not legal. “I haven't heard anything that would keep either player from the game,” Vrabel confirmed, signaling business as usual ahead of Miami.Asked whether the noise could derail a successful season, Vrabel dismissed the idea with blunt honesty. “Afraid? No, I'm 50 years old, I'm not afraid,” Vrabel said. “I love coaching this football team, I love the way they come to work… I've appreciated everyone's growth throughout this entire process… I want the best for these guys on the field and off the field.”For now, the Patriots move forward, anchored by routine, preparation, and a coach unwilling to let allegations define the season before facts do.Also Read: What happens next for Stefon Diggs?

Rob Gronkowski admits he’s ‘technically’ untouched his entire NFL paycheck and explains his surprisingly frugal mindset,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/rob-gronkowski-admits-hes-technically-untouched-his-entire-nfl-paycheck-and-explains-his-surprisingly-frugal-mindset/articleshow/126280855.cms,"Rob Gronkowski opens up about extreme money discipline (Getty Images)

Rob Gronkowski explains the discipline behind never touching his NFL salary







Rob Gronkowski has always played the game with joy, but behind the jokes sits a mindset shaped by caution and clarity. Long before postgame celebrations and Super Bowl confetti, he learned to treat his NFL earnings as something fragile. That thinking still defines how he talks about money today. It also explains why a story that once sounded exaggerated now feels quietly believable when he tells it himself.Rob Gronkowski shared that reality while reflecting on the uncertainty every young player faces. Careers end fast, contracts vanish faster, and even stars feel replaceable. Instead of leaning into luxury, he leaned into restraint. The approach did not come from fear but from perspective, built early and followed with discipline most athletes never manage to maintain.During a recent podcast appearance, Gronkowski addressed the long-running claim head-on. He said the rumor is “technically” true and traced the habit back to his first agent payment. “You've got to pay him back over the time, the first 50 grand you made,” Gronkowski explained. “I actually took that 50 grand and I bought me a car, I paid for my spot up in New England, actually, with it.”That early lesson stuck. Even as a four-time Super Bowl champion, Gronkowski lived modestly and avoided lifestyle inflation.“I didn't know how long the NFL was gonna last,” Gronkowski continued. “I was a second round pick, so it was like a four-year, $4 million deal, and I was like, if I can play this contract out, I'll be set for life.”His definition of security was simple and personal, not flashy. “I just always wanted to save it, and I just used my money that I was getting off the field to just spend it on whatever I needed to spend it on. Technically, I have not spent any of my NFL money.” That approach allowed him to separate earnings from identity and prepare for life beyond football.Since retiring in 2022, Gronkowski has moved smoothly into broadcasting at Fox Sports alongside familiar faces, including Tom Brady and Julian Edelman. Away from the studio, he continues to balance a packed schedule with longtime partner Camille Kostek, who recently described his post-NFL life as busy but fulfilling. The pattern remains clear.

Drake Maye isn’t buying the hype as Patriots QB shrugs off Patriots’ “easy schedule”,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/drake-maye-isnt-buying-the-hype-as-patriots-qb-shrugs-off-patriots-easy-schedule/articleshow/126280791.cms,"Drake Maye’s savage reaction to Patriots’ “easy schedule” talk (Getty Images)

Drake Maye shuts down schedule criticism with humor and perspective







Drake Maye has heard the noise all season, and he has reached a point where it barely registers anymore. The New England Patriots are winning, stacking results, and putting distance between themselves and the rest of the AFC East. After a dominant road win over the New York Jets and timely help from Philadelphia against Buffalo, New England sealed the division with a week still left to play. That achievement alone reshaped the conference picture and pushed Maye further into the MVP spotlight.The conversation, however, never stays quiet for long in the NFL. Critics quickly circled back to one familiar theme. They questioned the Patriots’ path, pointing to a schedule filled with struggling teams. It is a tidy argument on paper, but football rarely lives on paper. Maye responded not with irritation, but with humor and perspective, offering a reminder that respect in this league is earned every Sunday.When asked about the idea that New England’s success came against lesser opponents, Maye delivered a line that cut through the debate with ease. “We play in the National Football League. Every team has great players.It’s not like we’re playing Foxborough High School down the road,” said Maye, per Ari Meirov of The 33rd Team on X, formerly Twitter.The remark landed because it carried truth. NFL rosters are built with elite talent across the board, and no win comes without risk. Injuries, travel, pressure, and parity define the league. New England showed professionalism by taking care of business week after week, regardless of who lined up on the other sideline. That consistency is often what separates playoff teams from contenders.Maye’s calm confidence mirrors the Patriots’ approach under the spotlight. While others debate strength of schedule, the locker room remains focused on execution. The team has already secured at least one home playoff game, a valuable edge in January. There is also still a narrow path to the top seed in the AFC, a possibility that seemed distant only weeks ago.The timing of Maye’s surge matters. With Matthew Stafford stumbling on a national stage, the MVP conversation shifted. Voters tend to reward quarterbacks who combine production with poise, and Maye has delivered both. He has led without flash, trusted his teammates, and embraced accountability.The regular season now closes with a home matchup against the Miami Dolphins on Sunday afternoon. It is one final tune up before the games truly matter. By then, debates about schedules will fade.

Netflix’s Christmas NFL game rewrote sports history with a record no TV network could match,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/netflixs-christmas-nfl-game-rewrote-sports-history-with-a-record-no-tv-network-could-match/articleshow/126280728.cms,"Christmas Day NFL games set records for Netflix (Netflix)

Netflix NFL Christmas Day record signals a new era for live sports streaming







Netflix NFL Christmas Day record rewrote the rules of live sports streaming, and it did so on a day built for family television. Christmas afternoon turned into a landmark moment as millions skipped cable and tuned into a single platform to watch football history unfold. What once seemed like an experiment became proof of concept in real time, with viewers choosing convenience, clarity, and spectacle over tradition.The impact was immediate and measurable. Nielsen data confirmed that the Minnesota Vikings vs. Detroit Lions matchup averaged 27.5 million viewers, making it the most-watched NFL game ever streamed in the United States. At its peak, the audience surged past 30 million, while the halftime event drew nearly as many eyes as the game itself. Those numbers did more than set records. They signaled a shift in how fans want to watch major sports moments.The Lions and Vikings rivalry delivered intensity, but the broadcast was built for reach. Netflix combined game action with entertainment choices that expanded its audience beyond die-hard football fans. Snoop Dogg headlined the halftime show, joined by country star Lainey Wilson and lifestyle icon Martha Stewart.That mix mattered. It pulled in viewers who may not normally watch an NFL game but showed up for the event feel of the day.Netflix’s earlier Christmas NFL games had already hinted at this momentum, averaging just over 24 million viewers last year. This season, the Cowboys vs. Commanders matchup underperformed by comparison, yet the Vikings-Lions clash more than compensated. The result was a clear statement that the platform can deliver consistency at scale, even when every game does not hit the same emotional note.The story grew even bigger outside the United States. Netflix made the games available worldwide, and fans from more than 200 countries and territories tuned in. Globally, the Lions vs. Vikings game averaged 30.5 million viewers, reinforcing the NFL’s international appeal and Netflix’s unmatched distribution power.Christmas Day success did not stop with football. Netflix also released Stranger Things season 5 volume 2 the same day, and it became the platform’s most-watched title worldwide on December 25. While the company did not reveal exact numbers, the timing showed strategic confidence and audience loyalty.With Super Bowl LX set for February 8, 2026, on NBC from Levi’s Stadium, Netflix’s Christmas performance will loom large in future media talks. The message was simple. Streaming is no longer chasing live sports. It is shaping its future.Also Read: Cincinnati Bengals' faith in Zac Taylor sparks controversy after fan reportedly ejected for protest message"," Nielsen data confirmed that the Minnesota Vikings vs. Detroit Lions matchup averaged 27.5 million viewers.

Will Sherrone Moore ever get a second chance in coaching? Criminal charges change the equation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/will-sherrone-moore-ever-get-a-second-chance-in-coaching-criminal-charges-change-the-equation/articleshow/126273881.cms,"Sherrone Moore’s coaching future remains uncertain after his Michigan scandal and criminal charges. While college football has historically allowed disgraced coaches to return, experts say Moore’s situation is different due to safety concerns, reputational risk, and changing institutional standards. Compared to past cases, his path to redemption appears far steeper and far less guaranteed.

Why Sherrone Moore’s case stands apart from past coaching comebacks





Sherrone Moore’s fall from Michigan was sudden, public, and difficult to separate from the larger debate around redemption in college sports. Coaching history is filled with second chances, yet timing, context, and perception often decide who gets one and who does not. Moore now sits at the center of that uncomfortable question, with his future clouded by scandal rather than playbooks or wins.College football has shown a willingness to forgive. Fans have watched disgraced coaches resurface after long absences, often reframed as cautionary tales turned comeback stories. But Moore’s situation feels heavier. The stakes are no longer just about reputation or rules. They touch on safety, trust, and institutional responsibility in a way that complicates the familiar arc of redemption.Unlike several fallen coaches before him, Moore is facing criminal charges tied to alleged post termination conduct. That distinction matters. “I don’t think a college will take the risk,” said Louis Moore, a sports history professor at Michigan State. His assessment reflects a growing caution within athletic departments already under intense scrutiny.History shows that many coaches survived scandals without criminal consequences.Rick Pitino returned after multiple controversies. Bobby Petrino rebuilt his career following public embarrassment. Jim Harbaugh moved forward after legal trouble early in his coaching life, once saying, “I'm more embarrassed for the people around me than I am for myself.” His career continued because institutions believed the incident was isolated.Experts say Moore’s challenge is different. “Hiring someone with Coach Moore’s recent history would immediately raise questions about workplace safety, institutional judgment, and whether the school prioritizes student welfare or wins on the field,” said Robert Gemmill of ChangeMakers USA. He added, “The post termination conduct is particularly damaging.”Race also lingers beneath the surface. “Historically, the coach whose behavior gets forgiven, forgotten or rewritten is white,” said Sandy Young, a crisis communications executive. That reality narrows the path even further for Moore.If Moore ever returns, it likely begins far from the spotlight. As Louis Moore noted, “I think they’re done in college.” In today’s climate, redemption is no longer guaranteed by time alone.Also Read: Sherrone Moore scandal deepens as five women come forward with detailed accounts of troubling interactions","Sherryrone Moore’s fall from Michigan was sudden, public, and difficult to separate from the larger debate around redemption in college sports.

“I tried to do things”: Myles Garrett’s girlfriend Chloe Kim reflects on mental health struggles and life with the NFL star,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/i-tried-to-do-things-myles-garretts-girlfriend-chloe-kim-reflects-on-mental-health-struggles-and-life-with-the-nfl-star/articleshow/126273669.cms,"Myles Garrett’s girlfriend Chloe Kim opened up about her mental health journey as she prepares for the 2026 Winter Olympics. The two time Olympic champion reflected on therapy, anxiety, and learning to cope with pressure after Beijing. Kim also shared how her relationship with Garrett inspires and supports her, calling him kind, hardworking, and deeply grounding.

Chloe Kim opens up about mental health and her bond with Myles Garrett





Chloe Kim is stepping back into competition with the weight of expectation firmly behind her. Another Olympic cycle is underway, the snow is calling again, and the pressure that once overwhelmed her has not magically disappeared. What has changed is how openly she talks about it. Kim is no longer hiding from the difficult parts of her journey. She is naming them, owning them, and learning how to live with them.As the 2026 Winter Olympics approach, Kim’s story is no longer defined only by gold medals and flawless runs. It is shaped by reflection, therapy, and a clearer understanding of herself. Her recent comments reveal an athlete who has learned that strength does not always look loud or fearless. Sometimes, it looks like asking for help and choosing to keep going anyway.Kim has spoken candidly about how her mental health struggles intensified after the 2022 Beijing Olympics. She explained, “It was something I struggled with during COVID. I think it was, what, 2021 at the time? I think I tried to do things by, I don’t know, getting into self-care and whatnot. But my mental health got really bad, honestly, a couple of years ago.”That period forced her to confront years of pressure she had carried since childhood. “I had to hit rock bottom to see that I needed to take care of myself,” she said, crediting intensive therapy for helping her find balance again.Kim also described the anxiety that still surfaces before a season begins. “Sometimes I panic, and I’m like ‘What if I wake up tomorrow and don’t know how to snowboard?’” she admitted. Yet the fear fades once she returns to the snow. “But the minute I get my snowboard on, I’m like, ‘Oh, why was I being so dramatic? I’m totally fine.’”Her support system now extends beyond sport. When asked about dating Cleveland Browns star Myles Garrett, Kim shared how unexpected the relationship was. “I had no idea who he was. Like, zero idea,” she said with a laugh. That has since changed.“Honestly, Myles is such an incredible athlete. I’m constantly inspired and in awe of him and how hard he works and how incredibly kind he is.” For Kim, that kindness matters most. “I’m really lucky to be part of his life and lucky that he’s part of mine. Yeah, we’re happy.”As she prepares for another Olympic run, Kim’s honesty feels as impactful as any medal.Also Read: “I’m really lucky”: Chloe Kim is in awe of Myles Garrett as she opens up about his kindness and support ahead of her Olympic return","Chloe Kim opened up about her mental health journey as she prepares for the 2026 Winter Olympics.

Bill Belichick’s family drama spills into public view as Jordon Hudson and daughter-in-law ignore each other at UNC game,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/bill-belichicks-family-drama-spills-into-public-view-as-jordon-hudson-and-daughter-in-law-ignore-each-other-at-unc-game/articleshow/126273507.cms,"Tension within Bill Belichick’s family became visible during a UNC football game when his girlfriend Jordon Hudson and daughter in law Jennifer Schmitt appeared to avoid each other. The moment followed earlier public criticism tied to a CBS interview. Despite the awkward optics, sources say Belichick remains happy in his relationship.

Bill Belichick’s personal life draws fresh scrutiny after visible snub at UNC football game





What should have been a routine college football afternoon quietly revealed deeper tension within Bill Belichick’s inner circle. As North Carolina edged Stanford in Chapel Hill, the focus briefly drifted from the field to the stands, where body language and silence told a story no one needed to spell out.Bill Belichick, now guiding the Tar Heels at 73, appeared locked in on football. Around him, however, the atmosphere felt noticeably strained. His daughter in law Jennifer Schmitt and his girlfriend Jordon Hudson occupied the same VIP space but seemed determined to exist in separate orbits. No greetings. No shared reactions. Just distance that spoke louder than words.Photos from the game showed Hudson, 24, standing with her arms crossed in the suite, dressed in a white tank top and blue reptile miniskirt. Nearby, Schmitt wore UNC colors, opting for a long sleeve white crop top and blue high waisted shorts. Despite their proximity, they were not seen interacting at any point during the game.The visible divide traces back to earlier in the year, when Schmitt criticized Hudson on Instagram following Belichick’s CBS interview with Tony Dokoupil. “Publicists act in a professional manner, and don’t 'storm' off set delaying an interview,” Schmitt wrote at the time, a remark that reportedly deepened the rift.Belichick later defended Hudson, explaining that her involvement during the interview came after he made it clear he wanted to focus only on promoting his book, The Art of Winning: Lessons from My Life in Football. One source close to the situation said, “Her presence loomed large, to say the least. She was watching the feeds, standing beside the team. I would say that Bill was [generally] uncomfortable [during his appearance]. ”Despite outside chatter, Hudson appears unfazed. “I don’t get the vibe that she really cares what people think of her because she doesn’t seem shy about being out and being recognized,” a source said, adding that she maintains her own routine and friendships. Another insider noted, “He is very happy. He is clearly proud to be in a relationship with Jordon, and I think he really likes the companionship.”On a day meant to celebrate a hard fought win, the silence in the suite hinted that not all battles are played on the field.Also Read: “So much control you have…”: Kylie Kelce calls out Jason Kelce as his Eagles obsession turns uncomfortable","Bill Belichick's girlfriend Jordon Hudson and daughter in law Jennifer Schmitt appeared to avoid each other during a UNC football game.

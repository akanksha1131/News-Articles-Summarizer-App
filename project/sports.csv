NEW DELHI: In what was meant to be a celebratory night for MS Dhoni’s 400th T20 appearance, Sunrisers Hyderabad crashed the party with a ruthless pace performance, defeating Chennai Super Kings by five wickets at the MA Chidambaram Stadium on Friday.Veteran seamer Harshal Patel starred with the ball, picking up 4 for 28, as CSK were bowled out for 154 in pursuit of SRH’s 149/5.Harshal’s clever variations and calm under pressure proved decisive, especially on a surface that didn’t offer much pace or bounce.It was a well-rounded bowling effort from SRH. Pat Cummins (2/21), Mohammed Shami (1/28), Jaydev Unadkat (2/21), and Kamindu Mendis (1/26) all chipped in to ensure CSK never truly gained control of the chase.CSK suffered an immediate blow when Shaik Rasheed fell on the very first ball of the innings. Harshal then struck twice to remove Sam Curran and the dangerous Brevis, who was threatening to steal the game with his aggressive hitting.Harshal’s dismissal of Dhoni, caught at point for a single, silenced the crowd and swung momentum back firmly in SRH’s favour.Despite flashes of resistance, especially from Dewald Brevis (42 off 25) and Ayush Mhatre (30 off 19), CSK kept losing wickets at regular intervals.Coming to chase a total of 155, SRH crossed the finishing mark with eight balls to spare, powered by a steady 44 from Ishan Kishan and a late cameo from Kamindu Mendis (32 not out off 18).Heinrich Klaasen chipped in with seven, while Travis Head (19) provided a brief spark at the top.Though CSK bowlers, especially Noor Ahmad (2/22) and Ravindra Jadeja (1/16), kept things tight, SRH managed to make the chase a comfortable one, thanks to late momentum.It was a bittersweet night for Chennai fans, as their icon Dhoni reached a historic milestone, but the team faltered under pressure, undone by SRH’s relentless pace assault led by Harshal Patel.",Sunrisers Hyderabad beat Chennai Super Kings by five wickets.

Shah Rukh Khan: The superstar who turned IPL into a blockbuster

NEW DELHI: Punjab Kings skipper Shreyas Iyer’s scintillating form this IPL season has reignited talk about his comeback trail, with team’s spin coach Sunil Joshi attributing the resurgence to Iyer’s ""hunger for challenges"". Since being released by Kolkata Knight Riders despite leading them to the IPL 2024 title, Iyer has responded in style with unbeaten knocks of 97 and 52 to start the 2025 season.""If you look back at Shreyas' contribution from the Champions Trophy onward, he has become more consistent, especially against spin,"" Joshi said ahead of Punjab Kings’ clash against KKR. ""He accepts every challenge, every ball. That’s the mindset of a top player.""""He has shown the hunger and he is ready to accept every challenge he comes across. For any player of that calibre, you accept every challenge, every ball. I am sure that he has done some great work behind the scenes. It's a good momentum to carry forward as a leader as well,"" Joshi added.Iyer was a pillar in India’s middle order during the 2025 Champions Trophy, averaging 48.60 with two fifties in five matches. His resurgence has been fueled by both mental resolve and technical adjustments — most notably, a more open stance and deeper positioning in the crease to counter the short ball.Joshi also highlighted Iyer’s leadership evolution. ""He talks to every player — even net bowlers. That builds confidence and shows his care for the team. It’s a hallmark of a genuine leader.""Despite returning to Eden Gardens, where he lifted the IPL trophy last year, Iyer has shown no signs of emotional overdrive. ""Every game is important. The approach remains the same — play to win,"" Joshi said.While speculation continues about Iyer’s potential India recall for the England tour, Joshi chose to keep the focus on IPL. ""Let’s stick to the IPL. I’m not the right person to talk about national selection.""","Punjab Kings skipper Shreyas Iyer has been in superb form this IPL season.

NEW DELHI: Indian fast bowler Umran Malik has returned to the Kolkata Knight Riders ( KKR ) setup for a ""return to cricket"" programme whilst continuing his rehabilitation from an injury that prevented his participation in the current Indian Premier League ( IPL ) season.KKR's official X account clarified that Umran has not joined as an official player, but rather to collaborate with the team and support staff for his recovery.KKR stated, ""Umran Malik has joined the squad in Kolkata to continue his rehab and 'return to cricket' programme with KKR for the remainder of the season. He's not joining as an official playing member of the squad, but will work with the team and support staff to get back to his best! Welcome to the family, Umran.""KKR acquired Umran at his base price of Rs 75 lakhs during last year's IPL Mega Auction. However, due to injury, the team brought in Chetan Sakariya as his replacement in March before the season commenced.Previously associated with Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) for four years, Umran earned recognition as 'Jammu Express' for consistently bowling at speeds exceeding 150 kmph. During his SRH tenure from 2021 to 2024, he claimed 29 wickets in 26 matches, averaging 26.62 with an economy rate of 9.39, including a best performance of 5/25.His finest IPL performance came in 2022, securing 22 wickets at an average of 20.18, with best figures of 5/25 and an economy rate of 9.03. He emerged as his team's leading wicket-taker and ranked fourth overall that season.This success led to his India debut in June 2022 against Ireland. He has since played 10 ODIs and eight T20Is, taking 13 wickets at an average of 30.69 in ODIs (best figures 3/57) and 11 wickets in T20Is at an average of 22.09 (best figures 3/48).His most recent international appearance was an ODI against West Indies in July 2023, where he registered figures of 0/27 in three overs.His last competitive cricket match was an IPL fixture for SRH versus Mumbai Indians (MI) in March last year.Currently, KKR hold the seventh position in the points table with three victories and five defeats, having lost their previous match against Gujarat Titans by 39 runs.Their upcoming match is against Punjab Kings (PBKS) at Eden Gardens, Kolkata on Saturday.","Indian fast bowler Umran Malik has returned to the Kolkata Knight Riders ( KKR ) setup for a ""return to cricket"" programme.

NEW DELHI: A rare and unexpected moment unfolded at the MA Chidambaram Stadium on Friday during the IPL clash between Chennai Super Kings and Sunrisers Hyderabad , as Ravindra Jadeja was forced to change his bat after it failed the umpire's inspection.The incident took place right after Jadeja walked out to bat following Sam Curran’s dismissal in the fifth over.As Jadeja arrived, the on-field umpire stopped play momentarily to inspect his bat using the standard bat gauge — a tool used to ensure bats conform to size regulations.Watch:Much to the surprise of the crowd and players, the bat did not pass through the gauge, prompting the umpire to ask for a replacement.A fresh bat was quickly fetched from the CSK dugout, allowing play to resume.The brief delay added a layer of drama early in Chennai’s innings, drawing plenty of reactions from fans both in the stadium and online.Jadeja had come to the crease after Sam Curran fell to a clever delivery by Harshal Patel.In the 4.3 over, Curran attempted to pull a slower short ball outside off but mistimed it badly, sending a simple catch to Aniket Verma at deep mid-wicket. He departed for 9 runs off 10 balls.And despite giving CSK some respite with his knock of 21 off 17, Jadeja couldn't capitalise on the brisk start, falling to Kamindu Mendis in the 10th over.Earlier, Sunrisers Hyderabad captain Pat Cummins won the toss and opted to bowl first.SRH made notable changes, bringing in Mohammed Shami and Kamindu Mendis, while naming Travis Head, Abhinav Manohar, Sachin Baby, Rahul Chahar, and Wiaan Mulder as substitutes.CSK also shuffled their lineup, with Dewald Brevis and Deepak Hooda replacing Rachin Ravindra and Vijay Shankar.The unusual bat inspection moment, though brief, was one of the talking points in a match that was already high on stakes and expectations.",Ravindra Jadeja forced to change his bat after it failed the umpire's inspection.

Iyer, who guided KKR to their IPL championship in 2024, possesses comprehensive knowledge of the team.Kotian arrived at the team hotel on Thursday and immediately began contributing, delivering challenging overs to PBKS batsmen during practice sessions.",Mumbai all-rounder Tanush Kotian has joined Punjab Kings as a net bowler.

Liverpool manager Arne Slot is preparing for a potential Premier League title celebration at Anfield on Sunday against Tottenham, needing just one point to secure the club's record-equalling 20th English championship. The achievement would come five years after their last title, which was celebrated in an empty stadium during the COVID-19 pandemic.Liverpool currently lead Arsenal by 12 points with five games remaining in their campaign, while Arsenal have only four matches left to play.""It's a big responsibility. We are aware that the last time this club won the league was during the Covid time. So everybody is looking forward to Sunday,"" Slot told reporters on Friday.""We know there's still a job to do. We need at least one point. Our fans know as well. When they come to the stadium they have to support us in the best possible way as they have done all season. It's a nice game to look forward to but also a responsibility we have for Sunday.""The title could have been decided earlier this week when Arsenal faced Crystal Palace. Liverpool's players and staff gathered to watch the match together, hoping to celebrate, but the game ended in a 2-2 draw.""It was different. Normally when you watch a game of football, you are either alone or with family or friends. But we watched it all together,"" Slot said. ""Before the game, I would have been surprised if the game ended in a draw. But during the game, I wasn't because Crystal Palace again showed what this league is all about.""The upcoming achievement would see Liverpool match Manchester United's record of 20 English titles. Slot, in his first season after replacing Jurgen Klopp, would become the first Dutch manager to win the Premier League.""No, I get these questions so it comes to your mind but it is the last thing you think of as a manager at this time. We saw last week how hard it was to get a win against a team that was nearly relegated at Leicester,"" Slot said. ""I am not getting carried away. We have faced Tottenham three times and I know how hard it is to beat them.""Liverpool's impressive season under Slot has seen them lose only twice in the league. The manager acknowledges the expectations that come with leading the club.""This club has to win trophies,"" Slot said. ""The good thing is most managers work here a long time so you have a few chances to win trophies. You are aware of that but that is not the first thing that you think about when you walk through this door.""Some have suggested Liverpool's success comes from Manchester City's decline and Arsenal's injury problems. Slot responded to these claims.""Everybody can have their own opinion. You might have a different opinion. That is the nice thing about the world we are living in. I am only here for a year so I can only tell you what I experienced,"" Slot said. ""It has never been as hard to end up in the top four or five.

Leicester City captain Jamie Vardy will part ways with the club at the end of the season, bringing the curtain down on a legendary spell that spanned over a decade. The club, relegated from the Premier League this year, confirmed the news on Thursday.Vardy, who famously led Leicester’s fairytale 2015/16 title-winning campaign, has been described by the club as ""our greatest-ever player.""Signed from non-league Fleetwood Town for just £1 million in 2012, Vardy went on to score 198 goals in nearly 500 appearances, becoming Leicester’s all-time top scorer in the Premier League with 143 goals. His remarkable tally of 24 goals in the 2015/16 season played a pivotal role in the Foxes’ historic title triumph.The 38-year-old also featured in Leicester's 2021 FA Cup final win over Chelsea, further cementing his status as a club legend.""We can confirm legendary striker Jamie Vardy will leave Leicester City this summer after 13 seasons that have seen him become our greatest-ever player,"" read the club's statement.""Jamie is unique,"" said chairman Aiyawatt Srivaddhanaprabha. ""He is a special player and an even more special person. He holds a place in the hearts of everyone connected to Leicester City, and he certainly has my deepest respect and affection. I am endlessly grateful for everything he has given to this football club.""Vardy admitted he was heartbroken by the decision but acknowledged the time was right.""To the fans of Leicester, I'm gutted that this day is coming, but I knew it was going to come eventually,"" he said in a video posted on social media. ""I've spent 13 unbelievable years at this club, with lots of success, and some downs, but the majority have all been highs.""Vardy, the last remaining player from the 2016 title-winning squad, stayed with Leicester after their 2023 relegation and helped them earn promotion back to the Premier League. However, the club now faces a return to the Championship after another poor campaign.In 31 league appearances this season, Vardy scored seven goals. After relegation was confirmed following a 1-0 defeat to Liverpool, he offered a brutally honest verdict on the season.""This season has been nothing but miserable and for me personally, a total embarrassment,"" he wrote on social media. ""It hurts.""With Ruud van Nistelrooy’s side languishing in 19th place with 18 points from 33 games, Vardy's final appearance at the King Power Stadium is set for May 18 against Ipswich Town — who are also on the brink of relegation.","Jamie Vardy will leave Leicester City at the end of the season.

CHENNAI: After a nightmarish Indian Super League campaign, where they did not even come close to qualifying for the playoffs, Chennaiyin FC will be eager to salvage some pride in the Super Cup in Bhubaneswar. Chennaiyin will begin their run with a challenging round-of-16 fixture against ISL big gun Mumbai City FC on Wednesday.The knockout tournament offers CFC another opportunity to end a long wait – while Chennaiyin have not won silverware since their 2017-18 ISL triumph, they have not been at the continental level since the 2018-19 season. For CFC to pose a threat, they will have to stay “consistent”, a quality that head coach Owen Coyle believes they lacked in the ISL.“When we are at our best, we can stand toe-to-toe with the best teams. The cup competition is a great opportunity for everybody, because there is an AFC spot up for grabs. There is an incentive for everyone to go and win the cup,” Coyle said.“We started the ISL season well and finished strongly. We had a poor middle section of the season. For sure, there is added motivation to finish the season on a high. We were very inconsistent in the ISL; that is what cost us a place in the top-six. We have to get back to giving good performances consistently,” added Coyle.Chennaiyin should show drastic improvement in the defensive department, after keeping only four clean sheets in the league stage of the ISL. The luxury to use both Ryan Edwards and Elsinho at the heart of defence at the same time – a club can field a maximum of six foreigners – could solve some issues for the chief coach.Coyle acknowledged that there is a huge scope for improvement in defence but stressed that the team would not get into a shell for the sake of a clean sheet. “That (poor defending) was the biggest thing that hurt us in the ISL; we did not defend well enough. But in cup competitions, you have to win games. We will certainly not be seeing a more defensive approach; we will see a team going out to win games,” said Coyle.What should give CFC a bit of hope for Wednesday’s game is the fact that Mumbai could miss a few key players due to different reasons (injuries, rehabilitation and personal situation). While Jon Toral and Jayesh Rane have been ruled out of the tournament, Yoell van Nieff, Jeremy Manzorro and Prabir Das are doubtful starters for the clash on Wednesday.Asked if CFC will have the upper hand, Coyle replied: “We are under no illusion; Mumbai are a wonderful side. Van Nieff and Manzorro could probably make it to the game. They have many good Indian players like Lallianzuala Chhangte, Vikram Pratap Singh and Mehtab Singh who add to the mix.”",Chennaiyin FC face Mumbai City FC in the Indian Super League (ISL) Super Cup.

IF ARSENAL WIN:

Liverpool are on the verge of securing their second Premier League title, needing just three points from their remaining five matches to become champions. Arsenal's victory over Ipswich Town has pushed the earliest possible title confirmation date to Wednesday (April 23), when Arsenal face Crystal Palace.Liverpool currently sit at the top of the Premier League table with 79 points after 33 games played, holding a commanding 13-point lead over second-placed Arsenal, who have 66 points.The Reds require only three points from their available 15 to mathematically secure their 20th overall league title. Even if Arsenal win all their remaining matches, they can only reach 81 points, while Liverpool would have 82 points with just one more victory.The title race could be decided as early as Wednesday if Arsenal lose to Crystal Palace at home. In this scenario, Arsenal would remain on 66 points with only 12 points left to play for, making it mathematically impossible to catch Liverpool.Should Arsenal defeat Crystal Palace, Liverpool could still clinch the title on Sunday (April 27), with a victory over Tottenham Hotspur at Anfield. This would put Arne Slot's team 13 points ahead with only four matches remaining.The current Premier League standings show Liverpool in first place with 79 points and a goal difference of +44, while Arsenal occupy second position with 66 points and a +34 goal difference. Third place follows with 60 points and a +14 goal difference.Arsenal's win at Ipswich Town on Sunday eliminated the possibility of Liverpool securing the title that day, shifting the focus to the upcoming midweek fixtures as the next potential title-deciding moment.The title race has now entered its final phase with just five weekends of action remaining in the 2024/25 Premier League season. Both teams have challenging fixtures ahead as they navigate through the closing stages of the campaign.This upcoming period will determine whether Liverpool can maintain their substantial lead and secure their second Premier League title, or if Arsenal can mount an unlikely late challenge in the remaining matches.","Liverpool currently sit at the top of the Premier League table with 79 points after 33 games played.

Poll Do you agree with the decision to postpone Serie A matches following the passing of Pope Francis? No, the matches should go on as scheduled. Yes, it's a respectful gesture.

Trent Alexander-Arnold fired Liverpool to the brink of the Premier League title as his late strike sealed a 1-0 win that relegated Leicester after Arsenal's 4-0 rout of Ipswich delayed the leaders' coronation on Sunday.Arne Slot's side could have clinched a record-equalling 20th English title with a combination of an Arsenal loss and a victory at the King Power Stadium.Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW! Liverpool fulfilled their half of the equation, but second-placed Arsenal were not so obliging earlier in the afternoon.The Gunners' stroll at Portman Road meant Liverpool kicked off still needing six points from their last six games to seal a first title since 2020.Thanks to Alexander-Arnold's match-winning contribution after coming off the bench, Liverpool are 13 points clear of Arsenal with five games left for both teams.The Reds will seal the title if Arsenal lose at home to Crystal Palace on Wednesday or if they beat Tottenham at Anfield on April 27.It looked like being a frustrating day for Liverpool as second-bottom Leicester kept them at bay despite a host of chances for the visitors.Slot's men finally made the breakthrough in the 76th minute when Alexander-Arnold lashed home the rebound from close-range after Mohamed Salah and Diogo Jota both hit the crossbar.With speculation mounting that Alexander-Arnold will join Real Madrid when his contract expires at the end of the season, it was notable that the England right-back embarked on a wild celebration of his winner.Alexander-Arnold earned a booking for ripping off his shirt and planting it on the corner flag after he sprinted to 3,000 jubilant Liverpool fans in one corner of the King Power.""It took us a long time and, of course, a great moment for Trent after working so hard to come back. To score the goal that makes a lot of difference is very special,"" Slot said.""It's never hard to dream (of the title) but you see we are really focused on playing Tottenham.""Liverpool's title celebration is only a matter of time but Leicester will spend next season in the Championship after their woeful one-year stay in the top tier came to an end with a 23rd defeat in 33 league games.Fresh from a famous victory over Real Madrid on Wednesday to reach the Champions League semi-finals for the first time since 2009, Arsenal ensured Liverpool would not be able to start their party this weekend.Mikel Arteta made only three changes from the 2-1 win in the Spanish capital and was rewarded with a dominant display to kill the game off inside half an hour.""All we can do is delay that moment (Liverpool win the league) from our side to earn the right to finish as high as possible,"" Arteta said.Leandro Trossard was one of those recalled by Arteta and prodded in his eighth goal of the season to open the scoring.A flowing move saw Bukayo Saka's cross flicked by Mikel Merino into the path of Gabriel Martinelli to finish to double the Gunners lead.Moments later, Saka was chopped down by an awful challenge from Leif Davis that saw the Ipswich left-back shown a straight red card.Trossard fired in his second after a well-worked corner before Ethan Nwaneri's deflected effort rounded off the scoring.Defeat realistically ends third-bottom Ipswich's hope of maintaining their Premier League status as they are 15 points adrift of safety with five games remaining and have a significantly poorer goal difference than West Ham.Chelsea needed two late goals at Fulham to revive their chances of Champions League football next season with a dramatic 2-1 victory.Alex Iwobi opened the scoring on 20 minutes and Chelsea were meandering towards a damaging defeat until 19-year-old substitute Tyrique George fired in a snap shot from the edge of the box on 83 minutes.Pedro Neto then completed the comeback with a stunning strike in stoppage-time to secure Chelsea's sixth win in their last 17 league games.Fifth-placed Chelsea moved above Nottingham Forest, who travel to Tottenham on Monday.

Barcelona staged a remarkable comeback to defeat Celta Vigo 4-3 at home on Saturday, extending their La Liga lead to seven points over Real Madrid. After trailing 3-1 with less than 30 minutes remaining, Barcelona's Dani Olmo and Raphinha , who scored twice including a 98th-minute penalty, secured the crucial victory.Barcelona took an early lead through Ferran Torres in the 12th minute, who scored from the edge of the box after finding space in Celta's defence.Celta Vigo responded quickly, with Borja Iglesias equalising three minutes later. Pablo Duran's cross found Iglesias, who scored into an empty net after goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny failed to intercept.Barcelona's attempts to regain the lead saw Raphinha sending a free-kick over the bar and Robert Lewandowski missing the target. Szczesny made important saves from Ilaix Moriba and Iker Losada at the other end.Iglesias put Celta ahead early in the second half, capitalizing on Frenkie de Jong's error to score past Szczesny. He later completed his hat-trick after being set up by Sergio Carreira, taking advantage of Barcelona's high defensive line.""This is football, we really wanted to win, maybe we weren't at our best but the response from the team, and the fans pushed us on... we deserved it,"" Olmo told DAZN. ""These are three points that take us closer to our objective, they're important and we have to continue.""Barcelona coach Hansi Flick had initially rested 17-year-old Lamine Yamal for the first time in 2025 but brought him on after Iglesias' third goal.The comeback began when Raphinha assisted Olmo, who beat goalkeeper Vicente Guaita. Raphinha then scored himself, heading in Yamal's cross from the right.Celta missed a chance to secure the win when Oscar Mingueza headed wide from close range in the 90th minute.The decisive moment came in the 96th minute when VAR review led to a penalty after Yoel Lago fouled Olmo. With Lewandowski substituted, Raphinha converted the spot-kick into the top-right corner.""It's a bittersweet feeling... we scored three, which few teams can do here, but it feels bad,"" said Celta's Duran. ""We have to be proud of our team, we came here with personality, played well, had a good plan and carried it out -- but for small details it got away from us.""The victory maintains Barcelona's strong position in the title race, with Real Madrid set to face Athletic Bilbao on Sunday and a Clasico matchup scheduled for May.Celta Vigo, currently seventh in La Liga and competing for European qualification, showed attacking prowess throughout the match despite the eventual defeat.","Barcelona come from behind to defeat Celta Vigo 4-3 in La Liga.

He also shared a series of candid pictures from the track, including some behind-the-scenes moments — one of which resembled a recent post by F1 driver Alex Albon.Taking to Instagram, Norman Nato posted a few pictures from Italy and wrote a caption summarizing his experience at the 6 Hours of Imola. He wrote: “Difficult weekend in Imola with P10 in race. Still early process with our new team, we keep learning. As always after a difficult one, we gonna analyse and make progress to come back stronger for the next one in Spa @cadillacvseries @jota_sport.”Encouraging him, Cadillac’s official Instagram page commented: “Building and growing,” along with clapping emojis.

He clinched victory in the Mexico E-Prix (25 points), finished second in Jeddah Part 1 (18 points), and won Jeddah Part 2 (25 points). Thanks to this strong mid-season performance, his lacklustre Miami result hasn’t dented his lead.In second place is Tag Heuer Porsche’s Antonio Felix da Costa with 54 points.

While his performance dipped in the Jeddah double-header, he recovered well by finishing third in Miami and collecting 15 crucial points.Close behind is his teammate, Pascal Wehrlein, with 51 points. Wehrlein had a disappointing start in Sao Paulo but bounced back with a third-place finish in Mexico. Although his results in Jeddah were average, his win in Miami has significantly boosted his title hopes. A strong showing in Monaco could push him past Da Costa into second place.Also tied at 51 points is the youngest driver on the grid, Taylor Barnard. He impressed with a third-place finish in Sao Paulo and podiums in both Jeddah races—third in Part 1 and second in Part 2.

They participated in the 6 Hours of Imola Qualifying on Saturday, moving a step closer to the main race. Nato finished 9th, while De Vries secured 5th place in the session.Norman Nato, who races for Nissan in the Formula E Championship, represents Cadillac Racing in collaboration with Hertz Team Jota in the Hypercar category of the Endurance Championship. Nyck De Vries, from Mahindra Racing’s Formula E team, finished 5th in the Imola qualifying. He competes for Toyota Gazoo Racing in the WEC, alongside teammate Ryo Hirakawa, who placed 4th in qualifying.Calling it his best effort on track, De Vries told Toyota Europe Newsroom: “As a team, I think we can be fairly satisfied with qualifying fourth and fifth here. We maximised our package, as you can see from the tiny gap between the two cars. I don’t think we could have done much better than that; we did a strong job to execute a clean qualifying. The gap to the front cars looks quite big over one lap, but we will do our best with race pace, tyre management, and strategy to challenge for the podium.”Both drivers are now set to compete in the final race of the 6 Hours of Imola on Sunday, scheduled from 1 PM to 7 PM local time.In their last Formula E outing at the Homestead-Miami Speedway, Nato faced heartbreak after losing what looked like a sure win due to post-race penalties. Although he clinched pole and crossed the line first at the Miami E-Prix, he was relegated to 6th place in the revised results.De Vries had qualified 5th in Miami but ultimately dropped to 11th in the final standings after penalties were applied.Following this, they’ll shift focus to Round 6 of the Formula E World Championship—the highly anticipated Monaco double-header on May 3 and 4. With momentum building, fans of both electric and endurance racing will be keeping a close eye on their performances.Also Read: Following Miami E-Prix setback, Formula E driver Norman Nato gears up for Endurance race in Italy, greets fans with ""Buongiorno""","Formula E drivers Norman Nato and Nyck De Vries are currently in Italy for the second round of the 2025 FIA World Endurance Championship (WEC) They participated in the 6 Hours of Imola Qualifying on Saturday, moving a step closer to the main race.

Lucas Di Grassi’s podium at Miami E-Prix was an emotional moment: “You need to have lot of discipline to be able to work when you have bad results”,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/formula-e/lucas-di-grassis-podium-at-miami-e-prix-was-an-emotional-moment-you-need-to-have-lot-of-discipline-to-be-able-to-work-when-you-have-bad-results/articleshow/120478349.cms,"Lucas Di Grassi ’s podium finish at the Miami E-Prix wasn’t something he or his team, Lola Yamaha ABT , had expected. Overwhelmed with emotion, Di Grassi was heard screaming with excitement in the car as it crossed the finish line and headed to the paddock. His family also joined him on the podium to share the special moment.Lucas Di Grassi opens up on his long journey to podiumLucas Di Grassi had not scored a podium in the last two years with Lola Yamaha ABT, and he expressed the frustration that had been building up during that time, as his hard work wasn’t translating into results. His last podium came in Season 9, when he was part of Mahindra Racing.The 40-year-old shared his journey to the podium after the win. He said, “It’s very hard to start the project from zero so in the four races, I had four critical problems that pretty much didn’t allow me to finish the race. So I was like, it’s extremely (tough), you need to have a lot of discipline to be able to continue the work and continue to push when you have bad results.”“When you have good results, it’s very easy. But when you have bad results, to go back home, keep the focus, keep the head down and keep doing the work that you do that at one point it’s going to pay off. It’s hard because you work, it doesn’t. Then you work again, it doesn’t pay off again. And then you keep working until it pays off. And today was a day it paid off. So I am very happy.”It was also emotional to see Di Grassi’s wife, Bianca Diniz Caloi, and their young children standing alongside him on the podium as they popped the champagne. Buzzing with confidence, the driver is now aiming to keep the momentum going at the next race in Monaco. The double-header is scheduled for May 3 and 4.Di Grassi was promoted to second place after a series of post-race penalties altered the fate of several drivers who had finished ahead of him, including the original winner, Norman Nato. As Pascal Wehrlein was declared the official winner, Di Grassi was moved up to second place.Also Read: Lucas Di Grassi on Lola Yamaha ABT's second-place finish at the Miami E-Prix: ""It's a very special podium for many reasons”","Lucas Di Grassi had not scored a podium in the last two years with Lola Yamaha ABT.

How Nico Mueller secured the top spot

Andretti driver Nico Mueller and his race engineer Bertrand Mermine have surged to the top of the ABB Engineered to Outrun leaderboard following a dramatic Miami Grand Prix, where post-race penalties reshuffled the final standings in Mueller’s favour. Though he originally crossed the line in 10th, Mueller was promoted to 4th, thanks to a well-timed strategy and a dash of late-race chaos. His calculated decision to split Attack Mode usage proved decisive, paying off when several drivers were hit with time penalties after the chequered flag.The Engineered to Outrun leaderboard celebrates the most dynamic driver-engineer duos in Formula E—tracking those who gain the most positions during a race, with emphasis on overtaking prowess, energy management, and overall race pace. The season concludes with an award for the top-ranked pairing.After Round 5 in Miami, the leaderboard has Maserati MSG Racing’s Stoffel Vandoorne and his race engineer Thibault Arnal on number 2. Mahindra Racing’s Nyck De Vries and race engineer Tom Bayles are in third position in the ABB Engineered to Outrun leaderboard.The FIA Formula E Instagram account also shared the update, posting:“@nico.mueller51 overtaking his way up the rankings! With a mega drive from P18 to P4, the @andrettife driver tops the @abbgroup Engineered to Outrun leaderboard after Round 5. #MiamiEPrix #FormulaE #Motorsport #Racing.”Nico Mueller’s rise was the result of strategy combined with fortunate timing. While many drivers delayed activating Attack Mode until later in the race, Mueller opted for a more aggressive strategy—using two four-minute activations, starting with the first on Lap 11 to position himself within points range.By Lap 20, Mueller was running in 10th when a red flag was brought out following a three-car collision. After the restart, as the majority of the grid scrambled to use their remaining Attack Mode activations, Mueller’s earlier strategy gave him an edge.Despite finishing 10th on the road, he was ultimately classified 4th after multiple post-race penalties were issued. Drivers including Norman Nato, Robin Frijns, Oliver Rowland, Sam Bird, and Taylor Barnard were penalized 10 seconds each for misuse of Attack Mode, while Nick Cassidy received a five-second penalty for exceeding track limits.Also Read: Formula E Miami E-Prix 2025: Jake Hughes crashes at chicane, here’s how the multi-car collision changed the outcome.

Tokyo:

Pune: For Indian women’s tennis team captain Vishaal Uppal , it was “mission accomplished” after his team secured their World Group Playoff berth in the Billie Jean King Cup .“At the start, I sent the team a message saying our mission is Project Playoff. And it’s mission accomplished,” Uppal said on Saturday after India beat South Korea 2-1 in their last round-robin match to finish in the top two in Asia-Oceania Group 1 .“We have just proven when we become ‘We’, what we can achieve. It’s truly amazing. I know I was tough on them this week. I pushed them. But we had Project Playoff. It was a team effort,” said the former Davis Cupper.Shrivalli Rashmikaa played a stellar role as she won all her five singles matches, but Uppal emphasised on the team bonding, which he said played a vital role in lifting the Hyderabad girl’s performance. “She beat a lot of higher ranked players this week,” he said.“We’re playing a team competition, and for her to come out and perform like that, I think the credit has to go to the entire team,” he said. “When Shrivalli beat (Hong Yi) Cody Wong (of Hong Kong) the other day and Ankita ran on to the court and hugged her. That says a lot.” Ankita Raina played her part in the team’s success, combining with fellow senior Prarthana Thombare , to clinch the decisive doubles rubber against Korea. “It was deja-vu for me. When it became one-all against Korea, I remembered the mindset I had in Dubai for doubles, and tried to keep that momentum,” she said, referring to the last time India advanced to the playoffs in 2020.“And we were aggressive because as we all know that in doubles, the momentum can change quickly,” she said, adding, “We really came together. We are traveling and playing by ourselves, but there’s this one week every year when we come together as a team.”Prarthana, Asian Games doubles bronze medallist with Sania Mirza in 2014, hit the winning shot — a sizzling forehand service return down the line. And she was modest about it all.“Sahaja (Yamalapalli) and Shrivalli were fighting their hearts out. And it gives us the confidence,” the 30-year-old from Barshi said. “As much as it is ours, it is each and every person who wants to play tennis. It’s their win as well.”Ena Shibahara and Shuko Aoyama defeated Kayla Cross and Rebecca Marino 6-3, 5-7, 6-2 in the decisive doubles match to secure Japan a spot in the Billie Jean King Cup Finals on Sunday.The BJK Cup Finals will be played in Shenzhen in September.","India beat South Korea 2-1 in their last round-robin match to finish in the top two in Asia-Oceania Group 1.

Alcaraz wins

Monte Carlo Masters

Carlos Alcaraz had an outstanding start to his clay-court season last week, clinching the Monte Carlo title on Sunday for the first time in his career.After missing this Masters 1000 event last year, he earned the full 1,000 ranking points when he beat Lorenzo Musetti in the final, elevating his total from 6,720 to 7,720 points.As a result, Alcaraz moves one place in the latest ATP rankings (April1 4), moving up from No. 3 to No. 2, surpassing Alexander Zverev, who lost his first match in Monte Carlo this year. Zverev’s ranking points drop from 7,645 to 7,595, causing him to fall one place.This marks Alcaraz's first return to the Top 2 since October 28 last year, when he was also ranked No. 2; he had spent 23 consecutive weeks at No. 3 since then. Overall, this is his 89th week in the Top 2, with 36 weeks at No. 1 and 53 weeks at No. 2.Alcaraz also narrows the gap between him and current No. 1 Jannik Sinner, who is suspended presently, from 3,610 points (10,330 to 6,720) to 2,210 points (9,930 to 7,720).Sinner missed Monte Carlo while defending semi-final points as he serves a three-month suspension for two failed dope tests last year. Although Alcaraz can’t overtake him before Sinner returns on the tour in Rome, winning both Barcelona and Madrid in the coming weeks could reduce that gap to just 720 points, putting the No. 1 ranking within reach in Italy.In addition to Alcaraz and Zverev's place swap, there was movement elsewhere in the ATP Top 10: Alex de Minaur made the biggest jump, climbing from No. 10 to No. 7 — just one spot shy of his career-high of No. 6 — after reaching the semifinals of his second Masters 1000 event.Andrey Rublev also rose from No. 9 back to No. 8, while Daniil Medvedev returned to the Top 10 after being outside for two weeks, moving from No. 11 to No. 9. This marked the 2021 US Open champion's first absence from the elite group in over two years, dating back to February 2023.Meanwhile, Musetti closed in on a Top 10 debut, climbing from No. 16 to No. 11 — surpassing his previous career - high of No. 15 — after reaching the finals of his first Masters 1000 event. He’s now just 15 points behind the No. 10-ranked Ruud, with scores of 3,215 to 3,200.""I'm just really happy to have won Monte Carlo for the first time,"" Alcaraz said. ""It's been a really difficult week with a lot of difficult situations. I'm really proud of myself, how I've dealt with everything. It's been a really difficult month for me on the court and outside. Coming here and seeing how the whole hard work has paid off, I'm really happy.""This victory represents Alcaraz's first clay court success since his French Open triumph last season, with his only other clay court appearance resulting in a silver medal at the Paris Olympics.Musetti, appearing in his first Masters 1000 final after defeating top 10 players Stefanos Tsitsipas and Alex de Minaur, started strongly but faced physical challenges as the match progressed.The Italian received medical treatment for his right leg when trailing 0-3 in the final set, though he continued to play despite the injury.""It is not the way I would have wanted to win a match,"" Alcaraz said. ""Lorenzo's been through a really tough week, long and intense matches. I feel sorry for him, one of the best results he has done. To end like this is not easy. Hopefully it's not serious and he's 100 percent soon.""""It was probably one of my best tournaments so far,"" Musetti said, who won bronze at last year's Olympics behind Alcaraz and gold medalist Novak Djokovic. ""I'm disappointed I couldn't finish the match in the best way, for the crowd. You deserve it so I will keep going and try and come back for revenge.""The match began with Musetti dropping his opening service game but immediately breaking back and taking the first set, capitalising on Alcaraz's six unforced errors.Alcaraz's game improved significantly in the second set, which he won convincingly before completing the victory with a dominant final set.Both players will continue their clay court preparations at the Barcelona Open next week as they build toward the French Open at the end of May.","Carlos Alcaraz won the Monte Carlo Masters for the first time in his career.

Alcaraz had lost in the opening round on his only previous appearance at Monte Carlo in 2022 but returned stronger this year.“It’s been a really difficult week and a tough month for me, both on and off the court,” said Alcaraz. “I’m proud of how I dealt with everything.”Musetti, playing in his first Masters 1000 final, started brightly, rallying from an early break to take the opening set. However, the Italian began struggling with a leg issue early in the third set, requiring medical attention at 0-3. From that point, Alcaraz never looked back, sealing the decider without dropping a game.Despite the defeat, Musetti earned a rankings boost to World No. 11 and valuable experience ahead of the French Open . “It was probably one of my best tournaments so far,” he said. “I’m disappointed I couldn’t finish stronger, but I’ll come back for revenge.”Alcaraz will rise to World No. 2, overtaking Alexander Zverev, as the clay-court season intensifies. With Roland Garros on the horizon, his Monte Carlo triumph sets the tone for another strong title push.","Carlos Alcaraz wins first Monte Carlo Masters title.

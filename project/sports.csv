India began their quest for another International Cricket Council (ICC) title by dominating Bangladesh in Dubai on Thursday, which concluded the first two matches in Group A, and action shifts to Group B today (February 21).After veteran pacer Mohammed Shami once again showed his liking for ICC events with a five-wicket haul (5 for 53), India's vice-captain Shubman Gill (101 not out) took over to lead India's six-wicket win with a century while chasing Bangladesh's below-par 228 at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium.""Definitely one of my most satisfying innings that I have played and my first century in ICC events,"" said Man-of-the-Match Gill. ""Very satisfying and very happy with the way I performed.""India went in with three spinners and preferred Harshit Rana over Arshdeep Singh as the second pacer, and the right-arm fast bowler justified that with his spell of 3 for 31. Axar Patel led the spin trio of Kuldeep Yadav, Ravindra Jadeja and himself with his 2 for 43.Axar was unlucky to miss out on a hat-trick when skipper Rohit dropped an easy catch in the slips.""May take him (Axar) for dinner tomorrow (smiles),"" said Rohit after the match. ""No, that was an easy catch; I should have taken that catch with the standards I have set for myself.""Despite their comfortable win, India remained second in Group A standings, behind toppers New Zealand on net run-rate. The Kiwis had beaten Pakistan by 60 runs in the first match of this group.The two matches also saw as many as four centurions. Will Young and Tom Latham led New Zealand's win with their tons, while it was Gill and Bangladesh's Towhid Hridoy who hit hundreds on Thursday.India's win paused the two-day action in Group A, with Afghanistan and South Africa getting set to open Group B at the National Stadium in Karachi on Friday.",India beat Bangladesh by six wickets in Group A match in Dubai.

Empty stands even for India's matches beg the question: Are ODIs dying?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/icc-champions-trophy-2025/empty-stands-even-for-indias-matches-beg-the-question-are-odis-dying/articleshow/118435308.cms,"DESERTED STANDS IN DESERT: The sight of empty stands in Dubai for India's opening game vs Bangladesh made for bad optics. (Getty Images)

DUBAI: Is ODI cricket dying? That's the first question that popped up in one's mind as for the second day running several empty stands were witnessed at a venue in the ICC 2025 Champions Trophy.When proceedings began in India's opening match of the tournament-often referred to as the mini-World Cup- against Bangladesh in a Group A match on Thursday afternoon, there was hardly any crowd at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium- a rare, rare sight when Team India is playing.For a stadium which can accommodate around 30,000 spectators-25,000 is the official capacity, it was not a pleasant sight to see not more than around 10,000 fans at the magnificent DICS after Bangladesh chose to bat first after winning the toss.Soon, pictures of the empty stands during the first half of the match went viral on social media, as fans, justifiably, began wondering about the relevance and future of ODI cricket . Things, of course, were expected to get better when India would bat in the evening, as many spectators would turn up after work-Thursday being obviously a working day-to enjoy the action.However, the fact still can't be ignored that stadiums are packed to the rafters right from ball one when India play their matches in any part of the world, with every ball being cheered loudly, so the crowd no-show in the first half of this game was an even bigger shocker.That it's struggling to attract crowds is not just a hugely worrying sign for the Champions Trophy, being held after a gap of eight years, but also One-Day cricket in particular, which is already facing a question of mere existence in the face of continuous proliferation of glamorous T20 leagues.On Wednesday, there was a pathetic turnout for the opening game of the Champions Trophy between co-hosts Pakistan and New Zealand at the National Stadium in Karachi too, prompting former England captain-turned commentator Michael Vaughan to criticize the authorities on this front. Not only was this host nation Pakistan's first match of the tournament, it was also the start of the first ICC event in the country since 1996-after nearly a three-decade gap.""Great to see the champions trophy being played in Pakistan .. First major event since 1996 .. Have they forgotten to tell the locals it's on .. Where is the crowd ?? #ChampionsTrophy2025,"" wrote Vaughan on X.Highlighting the empty stand in the first match of the Dubai leg of the Champions Trophy, former IPL chairman Lalit Modi , who conceptualized the highly successful and cash-rich T20 league, wondered if the ODIs should be scrapped altogether.""Watching the @ICC champions trophy cricket match between #india and #bangladesh. Stands are empty. That would not happen at an #ipl game. Is the one day format becoming irrelevant to the fans ? What's your view ? Should one day cricket be scrapped and more test cricket?,"" wrote Modi on his X account.The deserted stands, and the lack of interest in this tournament and the ODIs tell you a story-unless this format and this event reinvents itself, their days are numbered.",Empty stands in Dubai for India's opening game vs Bangladesh made for bad optics.

DUBAI: An eighth ODI hundred by Shubman Gill (101 not out, 129b, 9x4, 2x6) and a superb five-wicket haul by veteran pacer Mohammed Shami (five for 53 in 10 overs) helped India down Bangladesh by six wickets and get off their 2025 Champions Trophy campaign off in style in a Group A fixture on Thursday at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium.Chasing 229, India seemed to be in a delicate position at 144 for four in the 31st over, before Gill, showing why he is currently the No 1 ranked batter in ODI cricket, found an able ally in KL Rahul (41 not out, 47b, 1x4, 2x6), as the pair added 87 in 98 balls in an unbeaten partnership for the fifth wicket to take India home. Buoyed by the win, the tournament favourites now take on arch-rivals Pakistan on Sunday.Coming off a century in his last game, the third ODI against England at Ahmedabad, Gill, who sported a determined look from the start, started dominating the Bangladesh attack from the first over when he executed a short-arm pull for four off Taskin Ahmed. Dancing down the pitch repeatedly to smash the bowlers past the cover region or pulling them with disdain, he looked in regal touch.Closer to reaching his eighth ODI hundred, the 25-year-old Indian vice-captain, labelled by his captain Rohit Sharma as a “very, very classy player” in the pre-match presser, flicked Tanzim for a six to deep mid-wicket- a stunning shot indeed.Chasing 229 under lights, India were quickly off the blocks as Rohit (41, 36b, 7x4) and Gill gave them a stroke-filled 69-run start in 59 balls. Going ballistic, Rohit smacked three fours in the sixth over off Mustafizur Rahman. However, once Rohit succumbed while trying to smash Taskin for another boundary, India lost a few wickets to stumble in the chase. Virat Kohli (22, 38b, 1x4), Shreyas Iyer (15, 17b, 2x4) and Axar Patel (8) all fell to poor shots as the chase became rather tense.Kohli cut an innocuous ball from leg-spinner Rishad Hossain ball outside off-stump to backward point, Iyer, trying to clear mid-off, but mistimed his shot, while Axar top-edged a slog sweep to give Hossain his second wicket.To India’s luck, Rahul, who sealed the chase with a ferocious hook shot that went for a six into the crowd off Tanzim Hasan Sakib in the 47th over, was dropped by Jaker at nine at deep mid-wicket off Taskin Ahmed, with score at 166 for four in the 37th over, and went on to capitalise on the reprieve. Batting fluently at the No 6 spot, Rahul showed exactly why India prefer him as ODI ‘keeper-bat over Rishabh Pant-to safeguard against a collapse.Earlier, showing signs of returning to his regal best after being out of the game for almost 14 months due to a serious knee injury, Shami became the fastest Indian bowler to 200 ODI wickets.However, fired by a gallant, maiden ODI century (100, 118b, 6x4, 2x6) by Towhid Hridoy, who staved off extreme cramps later in his innings, and his mammoth 154-run fighting partnership in 206 balls for the sixth wicket with Jaker Ali (68, 114b, 4x4), Bangladesh managed to crawl back after they were tottering at 35 for five in the ninth over to score 228.After they lost half their side with little on board after electing to bat first, Bangladesh rallied through Towhid and Jaker to reach a respectable total, though the duo benefitted big time due to India's sloppy fielding. Appearing butter-fingered, India dropped two catches- Rohit (at slip) and Hardik Pandya (at mid-off) being the culprits, even as 'keeper- KL Rahul missed a stumping chance.Unfortunately, despite Towhid’s brave hundred, Bangladesh folded up in 49.4 overs. Once Jaker was out caught at long-on by Virat Kohli off Shami, Bangladesh suffered another collapse, losing their last five wickets for 39 runs in seven overs.Bangladesh got off to a disastrous start when they slipped to two for two by the second over-Soumya Sarkar was caught behind off Shami for a five-ball duck, while skipper Najmul Hossain Shanto was caught at cover-point by Virat Kohli off pacer Harshit Rana, who repaid the faith of the Indian team management, taking three for 31 in 7.4 overs, giving a good back-up to Shami after being surprisingly preferred over Arshdeep Singh.Mehidy Hasan Miraz (5) became Shami's second wicket as Gill took a stunning catch at slip, reducing Bangladesh to 26 for three in the seventh over.After he looked rusty against England at home, Shami's return to form will be a big boost for India, dealing with the absence of Jasprit Bumrah due to injury. On Thursday, the 34-year-old took his landmark 200th ODI wicket when he took his third scalp. The top-class speedster reached this feat in 103 innings, incidentally beating the previous-best tally of current chief selector Ajit Agarkar, who did so in 133 innings. The peerless Shami also went past Zaheer Khan’s record of 59 wickets to become India’s highest wicket-taker in ICC tournaments.Bangladesh's woes got worse when left-arm spinner Axar Patel struck twice in two balls in his first over to send Tanzid Hasan (25) and Mushfiqur Rahim, for duck-both batters caught by Rahul behind the stumps. However, Axar was denied a hat-trick as Rohit Sharma shelled a catch at first slip to hand Jaker Ali a reprieve on nought. Realising his blunder, Rohit slapped his hand on the grass in frustration and immediately apologised to Axar.",India beat Bangladesh by six wickets in Champions Trophy Group A match. Shubman Gill scored an eighth ODI hundred and Mohammed Shami took five wickets. India now take on arch-rivals Pakistan in Sunday's final.

NEW DELHI: The ICC has confirmed Imam-ul-Haq 's inclusion as a replacement for Fakhar Zaman in Pakistan's Champions Trophy squad, following the latter's injury.Fakhar sustained an injury whilst fielding during the opening match against New Zealand in Karachi, forcing him to leave the field.The PCB initially reported that Fakhar was undergoing assessment for a muscular sprain. When he eventually batted, entering in the tenth over, his performance was noticeably affected, scoring 24 runs from 41 deliveries.On Thursday, the ICC officially announced Fakhar's withdrawal from the tournament due to an oblique injury. Any squad replacement requires approval from the Event Technical Committee prior to formal inclusion.The ICC Men's Champions Trophy 2025 Event Technical Committee comprises Wasim Khan (ICC General Manager – Cricket), Sarah Edgar (ICC Senior Manager – Events), Usman Wahla (PCB Director – International Cricket Operations), and Shaun Pollock (Independent Representative).Imam-ul-Haq, aged 29, who has featured in 72 ODIs, joins as Fakhar's replacement.

Mohammad Amir Exclusive: Champions Trophy hopes, India's absence & retirement talk

Such is the format of the Champions Trophy that even one defeat can jeopardise a team's chances of making it to the semifinals, and Pakistan must be licking its wounds while thinking that after their loss in the tournament opener against New Zealand on Wednesday in Karachi . But focus shifts to India's big stars in match number two, as stalwarts Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma take the field against Bangladesh in another Group-A game, this time in Dubai .The forced fourth venue for the tournament -- the Dubai International Cricket Stadium -- was brought in by the International Cricket Council (ICC) after India refused to play in Pakistan and the tournament turned hybrid.Bangladesh can be considered the weakest team on paper in Group A , but they have upset teams in the past in big tournaments. In India's case, mind rolls back to 2007, when the defeat against Bangladesh in a group game of the ODI World Cup haunted India until they exited the tournament before the knockouts.India announced their preparedness for the Champions Trophy by mauling England 3-0 in an ODI series at home, which also saw Rohit and Kohli getting some much needed runs under their belt. But losing Jasprit Bumrah to a back injury came as a jolt at the doorstep of the Champions Trophy, which has turned the fast-bowling unit a little deficient -- considering Mohammed Shami has just returned from a year-long injury layoff, Arshdeep Singh is short on ODI experience and Bumrah's replacement Harshit Rana is still finding his feet in international cricket.In contrast, the batting wears a settled look with Shubman Gill opening with Rohit, followed by Kohli, Shreyas Iyer and KL Rahul or Rishabh Pant as wicketkeeper. Axar Patel's promotion as a batter and his recent success against England adds a left-handed batter to the mix in the line-up, a role that his fellow all-rounder Ravindra Jadeja too can perform. It also allows India to play with three spinners and still have two pacers in the playing eleven.Also See: India vs Pakistan Head to Head Records in CT The pitch in Dubai historically has had something in it for both bowlers and batters, with spinners getting assistance as it wears down.Another team looking closely at this contest will be Pakistan, who have the big must-win match against India next on February 23. One more defeat will virtually mean curtains for the fancied hosts, which is not how they would want to welcome the return of an ICC event to the country after 29 years.Their heavy loss to the Kiwis by 60 runs in Karachi on Wednesday has let the home fans down, leaving much to be desired from both batters and bowlers who will have to come up with something special against India in three days' time in different conditions in Dubai.","India take on Bangladesh in their second Champions Trophy match in Dubai.

Champions Trophy: Will India and South Africa clash in another ICC final?

NEW DELHI: India will play all their ICC Champions Trophy 2025 matches in Dubai, but the excitement has spread worldwide. TV sets are being prepped, Team India jerseys are out and dry cleaned, refrigerators are stocked with drinks and snacks, and fans are eagerly awaiting the moment when captain Rohit Sharma walks out for the toss.The Champions Trophy fever is in full swing!Amid all the excitement, there’s been plenty of buzz surrounding the pitch. How is the pitch going to behave? If Rohit wins the toss, should he choose to bat or bowl?The answers will come on February 20, but the anticipation continues to rise!In an exclusive interview with TimesofIndia.com during the ILT20-3 season in the UAE this January, Dubai International Stadium pitch curator Matthew Sandery revealed that curators have not received any instructions from any team, including India. He also assured that the pitch would offer consistent bounce.India are in Group A alongside Bangladesh, Pakistan, and New Zealand. They will kick off their campaign in Dubai on February 20 against Bangladesh, followed by the highly anticipated clash with Pakistan on February 23, before facing New Zealand on March 2.""We're in a really good spot at the moment. We want to keep all our secrets under wraps for now. We had the Women's World Cup earlier this year, and it has really helped us improve our wickets. We're really hoping for a great tournament with our services,"" Sandery said.""No instructions (regarding the pitch). We're going to create the best surfaces for Dubai and the weather that obviously comes with the UAE. So we're going to make the best wickets possible for the best teams when they come here. We're really excited about the fact that India, Bangladesh, New Zealand, and obviously Pakistan, are coming. The big clash between India and Pakistan— as an Australian curator, I'm very excited.""We're going to produce the best quality surface at the time. We are making sure our surface is consistent, and our bounce is consistent. We want to make sure that when our players arrive here, they can hit through the ball. They should feel confident and comfortable that they can hit through the ball because fours and sixes in white-ball cricket bring people to the stands. So yeah, we're not going to change too much. We're going to make sure we create the best wickets for Dubai and Dubai only,"" Sandery said.India last faced Pakistan in Dubai in 2022, meeting twice during the Asia Cup. India registered a five-wicket win in the group stage but later fell to Pakistan by the same margin in the Super Four clash.Unlike the Asia Cup, which was a T20 tournament, the upcoming Champions Trophy will be a 50-over contest.Will dew be a decisive factor?""Of course, the UAE provides unique weather conditions, and here at the stadium, we have a unique structure. Our roof structure provides a lot of shade for most of the ground. The sunlight plays a massive role as well, because it comes across the wicket early and halfway through the afternoon. So naturally, it's going to play differently throughout the match. It's up to the batter and the bowler to adapt,"" Sandery said.","India will play all their ICC Champions Trophy 2025 matches in Dubai.

NEW DELHI: New Zealand stormed to the top of Group A in the ICC Champions Trophy after a commanding 60-run victory over Pakistan in the tournament opener on Wednesday. The Kiwis' strong start was powered by sensational centuries from Tom Latham and Will Young, setting the tone for their campaign.The National Stadium in Karachi witnessed a historic moment as Pakistan hosted its first major ICC event in nearly three decades. However, the home side failed to deliver, leaving the 29,300-strong crowd disappointed as they fell short in their chase of 321.Despite notable contributions from Khushdil Shah (69 off 49 balls) and Babar Azam (64 off 90 balls), Pakistan could only muster 260 in 47.2 overs.New Zealand, batting first, recovered from an early setback to post an imposing 320-5. Young (107 off 113 balls) and Latham (118 not out off 104 balls) steadied the innings after a top-order collapse, sharing a vital 118-run partnership for the fourth wicket.Glenn Phillips added the finishing touches with a blistering 61 off 39 balls, ensuring the Kiwis finished strongly with 113 runs in the final 10 overs.Pakistan’s bowlers struggled to contain the opposition, with Naseem Shah (2-63) being the pick of the attack. Haris Rauf (2-83) and Shaheen Afridi (0-68) failed to make the desired impact.In response, Pakistan’s chase never gained momentum. Skipper Mitchell Santner (3/66) and pacer Will O’Rourke (3/47) inflicted early blows, making the task difficult for the hosts. While Salman Agha’s quick-fire 42 injected some hope, Pakistan ultimately fell short, denting their net run rate significantly.Also See: India vs Pakistan Head to Head Records in CT With this win, New Zealand claims the top spot in Group A with 2 points and a net run rate of 1.200.

Mohammad Amir Exclusive: Champions Trophy hopes, India's absence & retirement talk

NEW DELHI: Self-discipline was the foundation of Mahendra Singh Dhoni 's illustrious cricketing career, and the legendary former India captain continues to uphold the same principles even after retirement. It is this disciplined approach to life that he wishes to instill in young cricketers.Dhoni bid farewell to international cricket in August 2020, concluding a remarkable career that included triumphs in the ICC T20 World Cup (2007), ICC Men’s ODI World Cup (2011), and the 2013 Champions Trophy.Speaking at an event on Wednesday, Dhoni reflected on his mindset during his playing days.“You always need to figure out what is good for you. When I was playing, I made sure that cricket was a whole for me — nothing else mattered. What time I had to sleep? What time I had to get up? What impact it had on (my) cricket, that was the most important thing.“You know, all the friendships, the fun, all those can happen later. There is a right time for everything and I felt if you are able to recognise that, that's the best thing you can do (for yourself), For me as a cricketer, I always wanted to perform for the Indian cricket team because I've said that in the past also, that not everybody gets a chance to represent the country,”“For us as cricketers, whenever we went on to the big stage or whenever we were touring, there was a chance for us to win laurels for the country and so for me it was the country that always came first,"" said Dhoni at an event at which the mobile app ‘Dhoni’ was unveiled.Despite having retired from international cricket, Dhoni still continues to wins the hearts of all cricket lovers in the Indian Premier League where he plays for the Chennai Super Kings When asked about his life post retirement, Dhoni said, “I've retired since 2019, so it will be quite some time. What I've been doing in the meantime is I just want to enjoy cricket for the last, whatever few years, you know, I will be able to play,”He said cricket is still a part of his life but he wants to enjoy it as he used to to as a child.“I want to enjoy it, how I did as a child when I was in school. When I lived in a colony, 4 o'clock (in the afternoon) was sports time, so we'll go and play cricket more often than not. But if the weather doesn't permit, we used to play football. I want to play with the same kind of innocence… (but it is) easier said than done,” he added.",Mahendra Singh Dhoni says self-discipline was the foundation of his career. The former India captain continues to uphold the same principles even after retirement. Dhoni will retire from international cricket in August 2020. He said cricket is still a part of his life but he wants to enjoy it as he did as a child.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118395692,imgsize-47914,width-400,resizemode-4/118395692.jpg"

England 's decline in white-ball cricket recently presents them with an added challenge as they enter the ICC Champions Trophy , opening their campaign against traditional rivals Australia on February 22 in Lahore.Not too long ago, England were both the T20 and ODI champions; but their form in limited-overs cricket has nosedived since then.Their preparations for the Champions Trophy saw them getting whitewashed in the three-match ODI series, while the five-match T20I series ended 4-1 in favour of India.Whil criticisms of complacency from cricket luminaries Ravi Shastri and Kevin Pietersen might be a little harsh, the statistics paint a concerning picture.Since their 2019 World Cup victory, England's ODI record has deteriorated, with 32 losses against 29 wins, including 10 defeats in their previous 14 matches.In the next two weeks, Jos Buttler's squad must produce the kind of crickete that helps them secure a top-two finish in Group B, which includes Afghanistan and South Africa, to advance to the semi-finals of the eight-team competition. Incidentally, both Afghanistan and South Africa defeated England during their disappointing World Cup title defence in India in 2023.Also See: India vs Pakistan Head to Head Records in CT England's recent India tour marked their first outing since Test coach Brendon McCullum took over the white-ball teams' responsibility as well. Despite initial success as England's red-ball coach, McCullum, the former New Zealand skipper, has been unable to guide the team to qualification for the World Test Championship final.The concerns previously directed at England's Test cricket during McCullum's tenure are presently echoing in their limited-overs performance.England's comprehensive challenges across all formats include their difficulties facing quality spin bowling and high-speed pace attacks. When their aggressive initial strategy proves ineffective, they appear to intensify the same approach rather than adjusting their tactics according to the match situation.The suitability of Buttler's leadership for England's white-ball restructuring remains a matter of debate.Following England's disappointing T20 World Cup title defence last year, limited-overs coach Matthew Mott was relieved of his duties.Buttler's leadership has shown no signs of improvement since then, with questions lingering about his ability to provide effective tactical direction or inspirational guidance to the team.Dynamic English opener Ben Duckett has recovered from his groin injury and received clearance to participate in the tournament, while promising talent Jacob Bethell remains sidelined due to a hamstring issue.The English bowling unit, which previously included left-arm pace options, will now feature exclusively right-arm bowlers led by speed merchants Jofra Archer and Mark Wood, with leg-spinner Adil Rashid playing a crucial role.",England's form in limited-overs cricket has nosedived since their 2019 World Cup victory.

In my mind, I am like, 'thoda aur bhaiya',"" said Samson, who plays for the Rajasthan Royals i the IPL.Dhoni retired from Test cricket in 2014, while he bid adieu to international cricket in August 2020. Since then, speculation over the five-time IPL-winning captain's club career has been rife. Following his international retirement, Dhoni's cricket appearances have been limited to the IPL.Also See: Champions Trophy 2025 Points table In IPL history, the 43-year-old Dhoni ranks as the sixth-highest run-scorer, amassing 5,243 runs through 264 matches and 229 innings.

IND vs BAN Champions Trophy 2025 : Shanto banks on pacy Rana to rattle India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/icc-champions-trophy-2025/shanto-banks-on-pacy-rana-to-rattle-india/articleshow/118404950.cms,"DUBAI: Spin is Bangladesh's most bankable factor across formats. It therefore came as a surprise when captain Najmul Hossain Shanto spoke about pace being a big strength of his side as they take on India here today.Much of Shanto's confidence comes from the presence of young tearaway fast bowler Nahid Rana . Unlike most Bangladesh pacers, who have relied on cutters, Rana, just 22, can rattle the batters by generating speed in excess of 150kph, and bowling consistently at 145kph.At the pre-match presser on Wednesday, when Shanto was asked how much fun it was to have someone like Rana in the team, the skipper said: ""Very happy. In the last few matches, he has bowled well and fast. It helps our whole bowling unit. It's helped us to challenge our opponents. But he needs to be fit and continue his form. We have got two or three others as well. We have a good bowling unit.""Also See: India vs Pakistan Head to Head Records in CT Shanto credited the Bangladesh Cricket Board 's decision to play domestic cricket with the Dukes ball , and the right coaching, as the big reason behind this turnaround.""I think the important thing is the change in pitches and ball in First Class cricket. We play with the Dukes ball, so the fast bowlers want to bowl a lot of overs. There are a lot of local coaches and overseas coaches who have helped our pacers,"" Shanto said.Rana has done well in his nascent career, having taken 20 wickets in six Tests and four scalps in three ODIs for Bangladesh. Rana has bowled in just one match vs India, the opening Test in Chennai in Sept last year and went for 1-82 & 1-21 as India scored a 280-run win. However, this sample size isn't enough to judge what he could do on Thursday.Also See: Champions Trophy Full Schedule 2025 ""Recently, he played one Test against India), so he has that experience, but he must deliver on Thursday. He is not someone who thinks about his opponents a lot. He just thinks about how he is executing his plan,"" Shanto said.Rana, who grew up playing taped tennis ball cricket in Rajshahi, has travelled in quick time to become Bangladesh's quickest-ever pacer. Having established himself in the Tigers squad, Rana is now ready for his first taste of an ICC global event.","Nahid Rana has taken 20 wickets in six Tests and four in three ODIs for Bangladesh.

NEW DELHI: India skipper Rohit Sharma showered praise on his deputy Shubman Gill and veteran pacer Mohammed Shami for their match-winning performances in India’s Champions Trophy 2025 opener against Bangladesh on Thursday in Dubai.Gill remained unbeaten with a classy century, while Shami’s five-wicket haul dismantled Bangladesh’s batting lineup, helping India seal a six-wicket victory.Speaking at the post-match presentation, Rohit lauded Gill’s composed knock, highlighting his ability to finish games.""Gill, we all know the class he possesses.

Rohit admitted that his team faced pressure.""We were under pressure a bit, but that’s expected in a tournament like the Champions Trophy. Against quality teams, you will have tense moments, and that’s where experience comes in,"" he noted.Rohit also reflected on his dropped catch of Jaker Ali (68), which denied Axar Patel a hat-trick.""Might take him (Axar) out for dinner tomorrow! It was an easy catch, and I should have taken it, especially given the standards I’ve set for myself in the slip cordon,"" Rohit joked.Despite the missed chance, Rohit credited Towhid Hridoy and Jaker Ali for their resilient partnership after Bangladesh’s early collapse.""These things happen in cricket.

I used to lose sleep before these games, thinking about my performance. Even if I had failed in the last few matches, performing against India would make up for everything. That’s how big this rivalry is,"" he added.Yuvraj further highlighted the significance of winning such matches, stating that an India-Pakistan clash sets the tone for the tournament.""No matter the format, it always feels like a final.

NEW DELHI: Pakistan have been fined five percent of their match fee for maintaining a slow over-rate during their opening game of the ICC Champions Trophy against New Zealand at the National Stadium in Karachi on Wednesday.Mohammad Rizwan ’s side was found to be one over short of the required rate despite the consideration of time allowances.In an official statement, the ICC confirmed the penalty, stating: ""Pakistan have been fined 5 percent of their match fee for maintaining a slow over-rate against New Zealand in the opening match of the ICC Men’s Champions Trophy 2025 on Wednesday.""The sanction was imposed by Andy Pycroft, a member of the ICC Elite Panel of Match Referees, under Article 2.22 of the ICC Code of Conduct for Players and Player Support Personnel. As per ICC regulations, teams are fined five percent of their match fee per over if they fail to complete their quota within the allotted time.Pakistan’s stand-in captain Mohammad Rizwan accepted the penalty, avoiding the need for a formal hearing. The charge was leveled by on-field umpires Richard Kettleborough and Sharfuddoula, third umpire Joel Wilson, and fourth umpire Alex Wharf.The fine adds to Pakistan’s woes, following their 60-run loss to New Zealand in the tournament opener. Chasing 281, the hosts struggled with the required run rate after a sluggish start.Pakistan were dealt another setback when opener Fakhar Zaman was ruled out of the tournament due to an oblique injury sustained while fielding in the second over of the match. The ICC has approved Imam-ul-Haq as his replacement.With their tournament hopes on the line, Pakistan must regroup ahead of their high-stakes clash against arch-rivals India in Dubai on February 23.

Brief scores: Vidarbha 383 & 292 in 110.1 overs (Yash Rathod 151, Akshay Wadkar 52; Shams Mulani 6/85, Tanush Kotian 3/81) lead Mumbai 270 & 83/3 in 31 overs (Akash Anand 27 batting; Harsh Dubey 2/26, Parth Rekhade 1/16) by 323 runs.

NEW DELHI: A determined Vidarbha put Mumbai in a challenging position at 83 for three in their second innings in Nagpur as Day 4 concluded on Thursday. The defending champions now require 323 more runs to secure victory in the semi-final match on the final day. Mumbai face a daunting target of 406.Yash Rathod 's impressive 151 (252 balls, 11 fours) and captain Akshay Wadkar's resilient 52 (202 balls, 5x4) helped Vidarbha reach 292 all out after starting the day at 147 for four.With a substantial first-innings lead of 113 runs, Vidarbha established a formidable target of 406.However, Mumbai's response appeared uncertain. Ayush Mhatre (18), Siddhesh Lad (2) and Mumbai skipper Ajinkya Rahane (12) fell to spin bowling as Vidarbha strengthened their position at the VCA Stadium in Jamtha, positioning themselves to avenge their previous season's Ranji Trophy final defeat.Akash Anand, who scored 106 in the first innings, continued his solid performance with an unbeaten 27 off 92 balls, including one four.Shivam Dube remained not out on 12. Mumbai's hopes rest on India T20I captain Suryakumar Yadav , Shardul Thakur, Tanush Kotian and Shams Mulani to mount a recovery on the final day.The challenge appears significant, considering how spinners claimed three wickets in the final session.Left-arm spinner Harsh Dube dismissed Mhatre and later had Lad stumped for two when he advanced down the pitch.Parth Rekhade, in only his second First-Class match, captured Rahane's wicket leg-before, marking his third wicket. Anand and Dube survived until stumps without further losses.The day highlighted Vidarbha's dominance, particularly through Rathod and Dube's performances.Rathod's fifth century this Ranji Trophy season increased his total to 933 runs in nine matches at 58.31, including three half-centuries.Left-armer Dube added two more dismissals on Thursday, raising his season's wicket count to 63 in nine matches, including six five-wicket hauls.The morning session saw Rathod and Wadkar bat resolutely, frustrating Mumbai's bowlers. Rathod reached his century off 168 balls during a substantial 158-run partnership with Wadkar for the fifth wicket.Mulani ended the partnership by bowling Wadkar for 52 in the 82nd over, and claimed three more wickets to finish with 6/85 from 44 overs. Kotian secured 3/81 while Thakur took one wicket.",Yash Rathod scores 151 and Akshay Wadkar 52 as Vidarbha reach 292 all out. Mumbai need 323 more runs to secure victory in the semi-final match.

Mohammad Amir Exclusive: Champions Trophy hopes, India's absence & retirement talk

Brief Scores:

Kerala 1st Innings: 457 all out vs Gujarat 1st Innings: 429/7 in 154 overs (Priyank Panchal 148, Jaymeet Patel 74 batting, Aarya Desai 73, Siddharth Desai 24 batting; Jalaj Saxena 4/137). Gujarat trail by 28 runs.

NEW DELHI: A crucial 72-run unbroken eighth-wicket stand between Jaymeet Patel and Siddharth Desai, coupled with Priyank Panchal 's brilliant 148, positioned Gujarat near their third Ranji Trophy final as they reached 429/7, trailing Kerala 's 457 on day four in Ahmedabad on Thursday.Jaymeet exhibited exceptional restraint, scoring an unbeaten 74 from 161 balls. His disciplined innings featured only two boundaries, highlighting his commitment to preserve his wicket under pressure.Desai provided steadfast support, remaining not out on 24 from 134 deliveries, capitalising on his fortune after being dropped on 11.The left-handed pair demonstrated exceptional concentration, negotiating 36.4 overs as Gujarat reduced the deficit to 28 runs with three wickets intact before the final day.With the match outcome likely hinging on first-innings advantage, Jaymeet and Desai aim to surpass Kerala's total and guide Gujarat to their first Ranji final since their championship victory in 2016-17.Gujarat's previous Ranji final appearance dates back to 1950-51, where they finished second.Kerala began strongly, with veteran Jalaj Saxena leading their bowling attack effectively. Manan Hingrajia (33) departed early, adding three runs before Jalaj trapped him lbw.Panchal followed, falling for 148 (237 balls, 18x4s, 1x6) as Jalaj struck again, dealing a significant blow to the hosts. Urvil Patel (25) became the morning's third casualty, stumped off Jalaj's bowling.Jalaj shouldered Kerala's bowling responsibilities admirably, delivering 61 overs. He bowled continuously through the morning session, securing all three pre-lunch wickets.Gujarat reached 325/5 at lunch, with Kerala sensing an opportunity to secure a vital first-innings lead. Captain Chintan Gaja (2) fell shortly after lunch to Jalaj, who finished with 4/137 from 61 overs, including 12 maidens.At 357/7, trailing by 100 runs, the responsibility fell to Jaymeet and Desai to stabilise Gujarat's innings. The pair responded admirably, displaying remarkable endurance against an increasingly fatigued Kerala attack.Post-tea, Jaymeet and Desai exhibited excellent defensive skills, preventing further Kerala breakthroughs. Jaymeet achieved his fifty from 107 deliveries against Nidheesh, marking his fifth consecutive 50-plus score in the tournament.Desai, surviving a dropped catch by Akshay Chandran, made his opportunity count. Despite scoring just one boundary, his defensive approach proved effective, supporting Jaymeet's measured batting.Kerala's close-in fielders proved ineffective during an intense final session. Jaymeet skilfully manipulated the field placement to accumulate singles steadily.Jalaj's lack of support from fellow bowlers potentially compromised Kerala's position, as fielding standards dropped and bowling effectiveness diminished.Nidheesh struggled for control, conceding 86 runs from 23 overs, proving the most expensive bowler.N Basil (1/59; 22 overs) and Aditya Sarwate (1/104; 36 overs) claimed one wicket each but failed to maintain pressure, enabling Gujarat's lower order to prosper.Gujarat introduced Hemang Patel as a concussion substitute for Ravi Bishnoi, who was withdrawn after suffering delayed concussion effects from a fielding incident on day three.Bishnoi sustained the injury while diving at point, with the ball deflecting from his hand to his forehead.","Gujarat reach 429/7, trailing Kerala by 28 runs on day four in Ahmedabad.

Mohammad Amir Exclusive: Champions Trophy hopes, India's absence & retirement talk

NEW DELHI: Star Indian pacer Mohammed Shami on Thursday achieved a remarkable feat by becoming India's fastest and overall second-quickest bowler to secure 200 ODI wickets during Thursday's Champions Trophy clash with Bangladesh in Dubai, marking his ICC tournament comeback with a brilliant five-wicket haul .The accomplished pacer reached this milestone in his 104th match, surpassing Ajit Agarkar 's previous Indian record of 133 matches. His final figures of 5/53 further cemented his status as a premier bowler in ICC tournaments.Shami now leads India's wicket-taking charts in major 50-over ICC competitions, with 60 wickets across ODI World Cup and Champions Trophy matches, ahead of Zaheer Khan (59), Javagal Srinath (47) and Ravindra Jadeja (43).His 200th ODI victim was Jaker Ali, who scored 68 and shared a substantial 154-run partnership for the sixth wicket with centurion Towhid Hridoy (100).The 34-year-old speedster stands second only to Australian Mitchell Starc , who achieved the 200-wicket milestone in 102 matches. Shami maintains an impressive average below 25 in ODIs, with six five-wicket hauls and ten four-wicket hauls, becoming the eighth Indian to reach 200 ODI wickets.Following a 14-month absence due to ankle surgery, Shami has made an impressive return despite initial fears about his career prospects. His determination to represent India again proved crucial in his recovery journey.The ankle injury occurred during the 2023 ODI World Cup final against Australia, interrupting his outstanding form as the tournament's leading wicket-taker. Complications with his left knee extended his absence from international cricket beyond a year.","Mohammed Shami becomes India's fastest and overall second-quickest bowler to secure 200 ODI wickets.

Liverpool 's unbeaten streak in the Premier League extended to 22 matches, but their second consecutive 2-2 draw, this time against Aston Villa , gives Arsenal renewed optimism in the title chase.Liverpool extended their advantage to eight points over Arsenal at the top of the leaderboard, but Arsenal now have played a match less.A point does little for Villa's hope of returning to the Champions League next season as they remain in ninth. A challenging fixture awaits Slot's squad as they prepare to face Manchester City away from home on Sunday.Initially ahead through Mohamed Salah's strike, Liverpool found themselves trailing after Youri Tielemans and Ollie Watkins turned the tide in Villa's favour.A deflected effort from Trent Alexander-Arnold brought Liverpool level, yet they should have secured all three points when Darwin Nunez squandered an excellent opportunity after coming off the bench.The hosts nearly snatched victory in the closing moments, with both Morgan Rogers and Donyell Malen coming close to finding the winner.An early opportunity for Villa saw Marcus Rashford's cross deflected into the net by Virgil van Dijk, but the effort was nullified due to Rashford being in an offside position.The breakthrough came at 29 minutes, though Villa were ultimately responsible for their own undoing. Diogo Jota intercepted Andres Garcia's poor backpass and generously set up Salah, who netted his 29th goal of the campaign.Within nine minutes, Villa equalised when Liverpool's inadequate clearance from a free-kick landed perfectly for Tielemans, who executed a skilful volley into the net.Jota squandered a golden opportunity to put the visitors ahead, sending his shot well off target despite being one-on-one with Emi Martinez.Villa capitalised on Liverpool's defensive lapse before the interval, as Watkins found himself unmarked to head Lucas Digne's cross into the distant corner.Liverpool dominated the second half proceedings, helping Slot maintain his unbeaten away record in the Premier League.Alexander-Arnold's increasing prominence in the match led to his equalising goal at 60 minutes, with a shot that deflected off Tyrone Mings.In pursuit of victory, Slot introduced Luis Diaz and Nunez as substitutes, with one of them having a clear opportunity to secure three crucial points.Presented with an unguarded net after Dominik Szoboszlai's pass, Nunez missed the target, leaving his manager visibly frustrated.",Liverpool held to a 2-2 draw by Aston Villa at Villa Park. Mohamed Salah and Youri Tielemans scored for Liverpool. Ollie Watkins and Trent Alexander-Arnold scored for Villa. Liverpool extended their lead at the top of the Premier League.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118402967,imgsize-43096,width-400,resizemode-4/118402967.jpg"

Bayern Munich clinched their spot in the Champions League's last 16 with a last-gasp goal against Celtic on Tuesday. The German giants will be joined by Club Brugge and Benfica , who also progressed to the next round. But it wasn't to be for AC Milan , who made a painful exit after a draw with Feyenoord .Bayern, who held a 2-1 advantage from the away leg, struggled to extend their lead at home. Harry Kane came close but struck the crossbar in the first half, while it was the visitors from Scotland who took a surprising lead after 63 minutes when Nicolas Kuehn, who previously played for Bayern, capitalised on Kim Min-jae's defensive error to slot the ball into the bottom corner.That meant the tie was heading for extra time, but Bayern ultimately would not need to go that far as they scored in the fourth minute of injury time.Davies scored from close range to level the match at 1-1, securing Bayern's progression with a 3-2 aggregate victory in the prestigious European competition.The draw scheduled for Friday will reveal whether Kompany's side faces Bayer Leverkusen or Atletico Madrid in the round of 16.Earlier, seven-time European Cup winners Milan were eliminated by Feyenoord, following their 1-1 draw at San Siro. It took the Dutch club through 2-1 on aggregate.Santiago Gimenez, facing his former team after his recent departure, scored from close proximity in the opening minute, bringing Milan level on aggregate.The match took a turn when Milan's Hernandez received his second yellow card early in the second period, resulting in his dismissal. Carranza equalised for Feyenoord with 73 minutes on the clock.In the closing moments, Feyenoord's Read was dismissed with a red card, though his team had already secured their progression in the tie.They now await to face either Inter Milan or Arsenal in the last-16 stage.In Lisbon, Benfica secured their progression despite a 3-3 home draw with Monaco, winning 4-3 on aggregate, setting up a clash with either Barcelona or Liverpool.The Portuguese side, who had secured a 1-0 away victory in the previous week, strengthened their position when Kerem Akturkoglu found the net halfway through the opening period.Monaco mounted a strong response as Takumi Minamino and Eliesse Ben Seghir scored before and after the interval, bringing the aggregate score level.Vangelis Pavlidis converted from the spot, marking his seventh goal in six Champions League appearances, levelling the match at 2-2, before Monaco's substitute George Ilenikhena responded with another goal.However, the tie swung decisively back towards Benfica as Orkun Kokcu made it 3-3 on the night in the 84th minute.Young sensation Chemsdine Talbi netted twice to help Club Brugge secure a 3-1 away win against Atalanta in Italy, sealing a comprehensive 5-2 aggregate victory.Following Talbi's double, Ferran Jutgla added a brilliant goal as the Belgian side built upon their 2-1 home advantage from the previous week's first leg. They will now face either Lille or Aston Villa in the round of 16.Despite Atalanta's 29 shots at goal, they fell victim to counter-attacks from the visitors, with Ademola Lookman's goal early in the second half providing little comfort.Lookman missed from the penalty spot and Atalanta skipper Rafael Toloi received a red card in the closing stages, leading to Atalant's elimination.","Bayern Munich secure their place in the Champions League's last 16 with a last- gasp goal against Celtic on Tuesday.

Arne Slot confident Liverpool can handle Premier League title race pressure,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/epl/top-stories/arne-slot-confident-liverpool-can-handle-premier-league-title-race-pressure/articleshow/118356270.cms,"Arne Slot. (Liverpool FC Photo)

Liverpool boss Arne Slot insists his side can cope with the mounting pressure of the Premier League title race despite showing signs of nerves in their tense 2-1 win over Wolves.The Reds travel to Aston Villa on Wednesday, knowing a victory will extend their lead to 10 points over second-placed Arsenal as they push for a record-equalling 20th English title.However, Liverpool have looked less assured in recent weeks. They nearly squandered a two-goal lead against Wolves and had already suffered a late collapse in the Merseyside derby when Everton’s James Tarkowski scored a stoppage-time equaliser. Their recent FA Cup exit at the hands of second-tier Plymouth has only added to concerns that the treble chasers may be feeling the pressure.Left-back Andrew Robertson admitted nerves were natural as the finish line approaches, but Slot pointed to Liverpool’s ability to grind out tight wins as proof they won’t buckle.“This is happening because we are nearing the end of the season, not because of us, but because of what people make of it,” Slot said on Tuesday. “We have won plenty of games by just one goal, home and away. I remember Crystal Palace away when it was tight in the end. If this happens now, people talk about nerves. But securing a win in the Premier League, especially at 1-0, always involves hard work and defending.”Adding to Liverpool’s challenge is Arsenal’s remarkable 15-match unbeaten run in the league since their last defeat at Newcastle on November 2.Several Liverpool players have prior title race experience from their 2020 Premier League triumph under Slot’s predecessor, Jurgen Klopp. Slot himself successfully managed pressure when leading Feyenoord to the Dutch title. However, he remains cautious about overvaluing past experiences.“We lean on the players. They have to show up and perform,” he said. “We don’t hold meetings on how to handle pressure—it doesn’t work that way. Experience helps, but we shouldn’t overvalue it. The ones who won the league here last time did it in the COVID era with no fans, and at one point, they were 25 points ahead. That’s hardly pressure.”Slot acknowledges that Aston Villa, who boast a formidable home record, pose a serious challenge for Liverpool.“When you see the fixture list, Villa away is one of the toughest you can face. They have a very good manager with a strong game plan,” Slot said.Despite not being at their best against Wolves, Slot believes that grinding out a win after the disappointment against Everton was crucial.“These are the games you must win if you want to achieve something. We didn’t play our best, but we fought until the end. That tells you a lot about this team.”Liverpool will be without Cody Gakpo and Joe Gomez for the Villa clash, with the latter set to be sidelined for ""a number of weeks"" due to a hamstring injury.",Liverpool boss Arne Slot insists his side can cope with the pressure of the Premier League title race.

Tottenham Hotspur secured a narrow 1-0 victory against Manchester United on Sunday, dealing another disappointing result to Red Devils' manager Ruben Amorim. A solitary goal from James Maddison in the 13th minute propelled Spurs above United to 12th position, marking their third triumph over United this season.The win provided relief for Tottenham's manager Ange Postecoglou, who had faced criticism following recent eliminations from domestic cup competitions and poor league performance. United slipped to 15th position, though maintaining a comfortable 12-point gap from the relegation zone.""The place in the table is my worry, I am not worried about me,"" said Amorim, who has managed just four victories in 14 Premier League matches since his November appointment. ""I hate to lose. That feeling is the worst. The rest I am not thinking about. I understand my situation, my job, I am confident in my work and I just want to win games.""Tottenham's first home league victory since November occurred amidst supporter unrest. Fans expressed their dissatisfaction towards ENIC and chairman Daniel Levy through protests before and after the match. A prominent banner stated ""24 years, 16 managers, 1 trophy - Time for change"" as supporters demanded Levy's departure.Postecoglou's squad received a boost with several key players returning from injury. Goalkeeper Guglielmo Vicario made his first appearance since November, whilst Maddison returned to the starting eleven. Destiny Udogie, Brennan Johnson and Wilson Odobert were available as substitutes.""They are quality players. We've had it pretty tough the last two-and-a-half months,"" said Postecoglou. ""It was important for us to win and gain some traction. I certainly feel there is still a massive opportunity for us in this back half of the season and hopefully today is the start of that.""United faced their own injury challenges, with Amad Diallo joining Lisandro Martinez as long-term absentees and Kobbie Mainoo sidelined for a month. Amorim's bench included eight teenagers, whilst Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee started upfront.The match saw several chances for both sides. Vicario denied attempts from Hojlund and Alejandro Garnacho, whilst Maddison capitalised on Andre Onana's parry to score. Garnacho missed a clear opportunity before halftime, and Zirkzee failed to convert a promising header later in the match.United's offensive struggles continued, with only the bottom three clubs and Everton scoring fewer than their 28 goals in 25 league matches. Despite Onana's save from Dejan Kulusevski's effort, Tottenham's defence held firm to secure victory, offering Postecoglou renewed optimism.","Tottenham Hotspur secured a narrow 1-0 victory against Manchester United on Sunday.

NEW DELHI: Liverpool on Sunday secured a 2-1 victory against Wolves at Anfield, extending their lead at the top of the Premier League to seven points.Luis Diaz ended his goal drought with his first goal in 2025, while Mohamed Salah continued his impressive form as Liverpool bounced back from a disappointing week.The Colombian forward scored his 13th goal of the season after going 10 games without finding the net.Salah's penalty conversion before halftime marked his 28th goal across all competitions this season.Wolves' Matheus Cunha scored in the second half, but Liverpool managed to hold on despite showing signs of fatigue in a tense finish.Liverpool's previous two matches resulted in an FA Cup fourth round defeat to Plymouth and a 2-2 draw with Everton.Arsenal's recent 2-0 victory at Leicester had put additional pressure on Liverpool's title pursuit.Liverpool's response moved them closer to potentially securing their 20th English title, which would equal the existing record.With upcoming matches against Aston Villa, Manchester City, and Newcastle in the next 10 days, Liverpool could strengthen their position in the title race.Manager Arne Slot was present despite facing charges for confronting referee Michael Oliver after the Merseyside derby.The incident stemmed from Slot's disagreement over James Tarkowski's stoppage-time equalizer, which he believed should have been disallowed due to a possible foul by Beto on Ibrahima Konate.Slot had urged Liverpool to use their 'anger' from the painful end to the Everton game as fuel to get back on track against Wolves.Diaz opened the scoring in the 15th minute with his first league goal at Anfield since September.The goal came after Diaz found Salah, whose return pass deflected off Toti Gomes. Diaz managed to chest the ball past Wolves goalkeeper Jose Sa.Dominik Szoboszlai nearly added to Liverpool's lead with a low shot that went wide.Jose Sa was forced to save Diogo Jota's attempt following Andy Robertson's cross.Liverpool extended their lead in the 37th minute through Salah's penalty, despite Wolves' protests about a possible push by Diaz on Emmanuel Agbadou.Salah's recent form has been exceptional, with seven goals in his last six appearances.Wolves' new signing Marshall Munetsi missed a clear opportunity early in the second half, with Alisson Becker making a crucial save.A penalty decision for Liverpool was overturned by VAR after replays showed Jota had dived following Agbadou's challenge.Cunha took advantage of Liverpool's declining momentum, scoring with a curling shot past Ryan Gravenberch in the 67th minute.Liverpool persevered through a challenging final period to claim their fourth victory in five league matches.","Liverpool beat Wolves 2-1 to extend their lead at the top of the Premier League to seven points.

Elena Rybakina ’s tennis is so smooth it gives satin a fair run. The 25-year-old rips aces almost casually and steps in and hits through the court, making it all look effortless.“It doesn’t come easy at all,” the world No. 7 said. “I’m trying to work on different things on the court. If it looks easy, I’m happy. But definitely it’s not an easy sport. I always play aggressive, today a lot of things went my way.”The Kazakh, 6 ft in her tennis shoes, was in and out of the court in 72 minutes, of which 10 minutes were lost to a drizzle. She was through 6-3, 6-2 against the Japanese Moyuka Uchijima in the second round of the Dubai Duty Free tennis championships .On a rain hit day at the WTA 1000 event , where world No. 4 Jasmine Paolini’s match against German Eva Lys was paused at match point 6-2, 6-5 (30-40) for five hours – before the players returned on court and the Italian closed on the first point – Rybakina ’s play provided the sunshine. She had seven aces and won 26 of 32 points on her first serve.It might be because the 23-year-old Japanese’ play matched well with Rybakina, who was meetingthe ball in her comfort zone and striking freely. The small crowd in attendance on an outside court recognised they were watching a special talent and got behind the Kazakh, who looked a cut above, even in tricky conditions.Next up for Rybakina, in the roundof-16 is Spain’s Paula Badosa, the other player to dodge the rain on the day. Badosa, back in the top-10, leads the headto-head 4-3, but the Moscow-born Rybakina has won their last two meetings.Rybakina, cheered on by her new coach Davide Sanguinetti, whose calls of ‘come on Elena, let’s go’ was a constant during the hour-long affair, didn’t need any encouragement.Rybakina, caught in a crossfire with the WTA, who investigated and suspended her coach Stefano Vukov and suspended the 37-year-old Croat for a year for the abusive nature of his conduct.“It’s not easy of course,” Rybakina said of her situation. “(I’m) very disappointed (with) the way it’s been handled, just the outcome. But anyway, I need to focus on my tournament. It’s what I’m trying to do. Hopefully I can just keep on playing, keep on winning.”Rybakina, who maintains she hasn’t been mistreated by Vukov, despite new information emerging in The Athletic which noted that Vukov’s behaviour prompted the Wimbledon champion’s inner circle to approach the WTA as they feared for the safety of the player.While the top players – world No.1 Aryna Sabalenka, Coco Gauff and Jessica Pegula – have refused to comment on Rybakina’s situation out of respect for the player, the Kazakh said no onehad offered support.“I don’t need support,” Rybakina said. “There are a couple of players (with whom) I’m in touch with more, but to say that I have very, very close friends on Tour is not true just because we are competing against each other. Everybody’s surrounded by their teams.”Asked what she does in her downtime, especially here in Dubai where she bought an apartment two years ago, Rybakina said she enjoys going to the beach and indulging herself in the shops.","Elena Rybakina beat Moyuka Uchijima 6-3, 6-2 in the second round of the Dubai Duty Free tennis championships.

Punjab Kings (PBKS) will be looking to bounce back from a morale-sapping defeat when they take on Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) in Mullanpur on Tuesday. PBKS were left stunned in their previous outing as Abhishek Sharma's 141 off 55 balls overshadowed their massive 245-run total. The loss exposed Punjab's struggling bowling and sloppy fielding, with the team having already dropped 12 catches this season.The biggest concern lies in the bowling department, where even seasoned spinner Yuzvendra Chahal has leaked runs at 11.13 economy. With Lockie Ferguson ruled out indefinitely due to injury and Marco Jansen also struggling, Punjab’s attack looks vulnerable — especially against a KKR unit brimming with confidence after thrashing CSK in Chennai.The batting has shown promise, led by skipper Shreyas Iyer (250 runs), and emerging talents like Priyansh Arya and Shashank Singh. However, underperforming overseas stars Glenn Maxwell and Marcus Stoinis remain a concern.As PBKS contemplate pitch conditions — flat or spin-friendly — they’ll be wary of KKR's versatile spinners Sunil Narine and Varun Chakravarthy. With back-to-back matches lined up against KKR and RCB, Punjab's season could hinge on how they respond this week.The pitch offered balanced conditions with a few dry patches aiding both batters and bowlers. The larger square boundary (69m) and a 74m straight boundary made placement key for runs. Batting remained steady throughout, but bowlers found success with disciplined lengths. Overpitched deliveries came on nicely for batters to drive, while shorter balls sat up well. The key on this surface is hitting a good length consistently, which keeps the batters in check and prevents easy scoring. Overall, it’s a surface that rewards smart bowling and calculated strokeplay.Priyansh Arya, Prabhsimran Singh (w), Shreyas Iyer (c), Marcus Stoinis, Nehal Wadhera, Glenn Maxwell, Shashank Singh, Marco Jansen, Yuzvendra Chahal, Arshdeep Singh, Xavier BartlettJosh Inglis/Yash ThakurQuinton de Kock (w), Sunil Narine, Ajinkya Rahane (c), Venkatesh Iyer, Rinku Singh, Moeen Ali, Andre Russell, Ramandeep Singh, Harshit Rana, Vaibhav Arora, Varun ChakaravarthyAngkrish Raghuvanshi/Manish PandeyShreyas Iyer (c), Yuzvendra Chahal, Arshdeep Singh, Marcus Stoinis, Nehal Wadhera, Glenn Maxwell, Vyshak Vijaykumar, Yash Thakur, Harpreet Brar, Vishnu Vinod, Marco Jansen, Josh Inglis, Xavier Bartlett, Kuldeep Sen, Pyla Avinash, Suryansh Shedge, Musheer Khan, Harnoor Pannu, Aaron Hardie, Priyansh Arya, Azmatullah OmarzaiAjinkya Rahane (c), Rinku Singh, Quinton de Kock (wk), Rahmanullah Gurbaz (wk), Angkrish Raghuvanshi, Rovman Powell, Manish Pandey, Luvnith Sisodia, Venkatesh Iyer, Anukul Roy, Moeen Ali, Ramandeep Singh, Andre Russell, Anrich Nortje, Vaibhav Arora, Mayank Markande, Spencer Johnson, Harshit Rana, Sunil Narine, Varun Chakravarthy and Chetan Sakariya.Defending champions KKR hold a dominant edge over PBKS, winning 21 of their 33 encounters.

NEW DELHI: Delhi Capitals are set to host Mumbai Indians in their IPL 2025 clash at the Arun Jaitley Stadium on Sunday. The Hardik Pandya-led Mumbai Indians have already arrived in the capital and are currently training in the city.However, their preparations were affected as Delhi and surrounding NCR regions experienced a sudden dip in temperature on Friday, accompanied by dusty storms for the second consecutive day. The weather disrupted flight operations at the Delhi airport, leading to multiple delays and diversions — and even impacted Mumbai Indians’ practice session.In a video shared by the Mumbai Indians on their social media platforms, star batter Rohit Sharma is seen reacting humorously to the incoming storm. As strong winds hit the stadium, Rohit can be heard shouting “comeback” to his teammates. He then playfully tells the cameraman to focus on the storm instead of him.(Hey, why are you filming me? Shoot the storm instead),"" Rohit says in the clip.Meanwhile, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) has issued a yellow alert for Delhi on April 11, with temperatures expected to range between 23°C and 38°C.While the storms caused disruption, the overcast skies and cooler winds brought a brief respite from the heatwave that had gripped the region over the past week.Delhi Capitals remain the only unbeaten side in the tournament so far with four wins from four matches.Mumbai Indians, on the other hand, are struggling at the bottom half of the table — placed eighth with just one win and four defeats in five games.","Delhi Capitals host Mumbai Indians in their IPL 2025 clash on Sunday.

When will CSK legend MS Dhoni retire from IPL? Astrologer Greenstone Lobo predicts

NEW DELHI: Chennai Super Kings skipper MS Dhoni once again won hearts — not just with his vintage finishing touch, but also with his humility. After playing a crucial role in CSK's five-wicket win over Lucknow Super Giants in the IPL , Dhoni questioned why he was named Player of the Match when left-arm wrist-spinner Noor Ahmad had bowled ""well.""Dhoni rolled back the years with a classic chase-finishing cameo, helping Chennai snap their five-match losing streak in Lucknow. Coming in at 115/5 with 52 runs still needed from the final five overs, Dhoni assessed the situation swiftly and put together a flawless finishing plan alongside Shivam Dube.With Dube delivering the firepower at one end, Dhoni calmly guided CSK to their 167-run target with an unbeaten 26 off just 11 balls — at a stunning strike rate of 236.36. The win marked CSK’s second of the season, with Dhoni being adjudged Player of the Match — making him the oldest player in IPL history to win the award.However, true to his modest nature, Dhoni questioned the decision to honour him over Noor Ahmad, who delivered a brilliant spell — conceding only 13 runs in his four overs at an economy rate of 3.20, on a night where most bowlers struggled.""Even today, I was like - 'Why are they giving me the award?' Noor bowled really well,"" Dhoni said at the post-match presentation.While Chennai's bowlers impressed, the team also made some much-needed tweaks in the batting department. Young Andhra Pradesh batter Shaik Rasheed replaced Devon Conway and made an instant impact, smashing a brisk 27 off 19 balls, including six boundaries. His aggressive start powered CSK to 59/1 in the powerplay, laying the foundation for the successful chase.Rasheed’s timing and shot selection caught the eye, with his stylish strokeplay showing maturity beyond his years. Dhoni, impressed by the youngster's composure, praised his ability to play “authentic shots.”""I think he batted really well today. He has been with us for quite a few years (Shaik Rasheed). This year, he has been batting really well in the nets against both pacers and spinners. It's just the start.

NEW DELHI: Chennai Super Kings finally returned to winning ways in the Indian Premier League 2025, halting a five-match losing streak with a thrilling five-wicket victory over Lucknow Super Giants at the Ekana Stadium on Monday. Despite the much-needed win, CSK continue to languish at the bottom of the points table.Chasing 167, it was the calm presence of Shivam Dube (43* off 37 balls) and a vintage finishing act from MS Dhoni (26* off 11 balls) that sealed the win for CSK with three balls to spare. The duo came together when CSK were in deep trouble at 111 for 5 in 15 overs and stitched a crucial 57-run stand in just 27 deliveries to steer their team home.This marked only the second win for CSK in seven matches, taking their points tally to 4. However, they remain in 10th place due to a poor net run rate and overall consistency issues.For LSG, the loss was their third of the season in seven games. They are currently fourth on the table with 8 points, still firmly in contention for a playoff spot.Earlier in the evening, LSG captain Rishabh Pant returned to form with a composed 63 off 49 balls, anchoring his team to a respectable total of 166.

NEW DELHI: In a significant mid-season change, Chennai Super Kings (CSK) have signed Mumbai’s rising star Ayush Mhatre as an injury replacement for Ruturaj Gaikwad , who has been ruled out of the remainder of IPL 2025 due to an elbow injury.

He was part of BCCI 's Under-19 zonal camp at the time and was flown in from Rajkot for the trials.“Yes, we’ve called him for trials. He has impressed our talent scouts,” CSK MD & CEO Kasi Viswanathan had told TOI.Mhatre had an impressive domestic season with 458 runs in the Vijay Hazare Trophy and 471 runs in the Ranji Trophy, including three centuries across formats.The blow to CSK came when Gaikwad sustained an elbow injury during the match against Rajasthan Royals on March 30. Though he played two games after that, scoring 5 and 1, he never fully recovered. Head coach Stephen Fleming confirmed Gaikwad’s exit before their clash against KKR, prompting MS Dhoni to retake the captaincy reins.Meanwhile, Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) have signed Karnataka's Smaran Ravichandran as a replacement for Adam Zampa, who has also been ruled out due to injury.

Kolkata: Is Jose Molina ’s Mohun Bagan Super Giant the best team in Indian Super League ’s 11-year-old history?Finishing the 2024-2025 season with a remarkable Shield-Cup double, with record-breaking 19 wins and 52 goals, Mohun Bagan have set a benchmark for other teams to emulate. It’s perhaps ideal for them to complete the double with a come-from-behind 2-1 win over Bengaluru FC at their boisterous fortress — the Salt Lake Stadium — which was brought to its feet in game after game in salute of a genuinely special team at play and its repertoire of promise and panache.History will remember Sergio Lobera ’s Mumbai City FC as the first team to do the ISL double when, backed by the financial and technical might of the City Football Group which owns Man City, they achieved the target in Goa in 2020-2021 at a time when the world was existing in a bubble.Molina’s Bagan, in a way, made the real noise. Like Mumbai City of five seasons ago, they too have had a strong financial backing from principal team owner Sanjiv Goenka. Like Lobera’s side, Molina’s team also has had the strongest squad in the league. Bagan’s ascent to a triumphant finish to the league, many believe, looked destined before the season started rolling.Of course, Lobera’s FC Goa in 2019-20 and Des Buckingham’s Mumbai City in 2022-2023 were special in their own rights, but there was also a lingering lament that both these teams failed to explore their full potentiality.True that football, just like life, doesn’t always follow scripts of one’s liking. Credit to Molina for turning his team into a winning machine running on the engine of consistency, character and never-say-die mentality.Take for example the Spaniard’s use of substitutions in the second half here on Saturday, bringing Ashique Kuruniyan and Sahal Abdul Samad in place of an off-colour Liston Colaco and an ineffective Anirudh Thapa.“Sahal and Ashique had their moment in the final. You need great players on the bench who can wait for their moment and change the game,” Molina said after the match. “But at the end of the day, there’s no secret to success. It’s all about hard work and belief,” the Bagan coach pointed out.","Mohun Bagan beat Bengaluru FC to complete the ISL Shield and Cup double. Jose Molina’s Bagan, in a way, made the real noise.

Liverpool moved within touching distance of the Premier League title after a dramatic 2-1 win over West Ham at Anfield on Sunday, thanks to a late header from captain Virgil van Dijk .

Mohamed Salah ignited Liverpool’s charge in the 18th minute with a brilliant run from halfway, sliding a perfectly timed ball to Luis Diaz , who tapped in from close range.Though an unfortunate own goal from Andy Robertson — deflecting off Van Dijk — briefly pegged Liverpool back in the 86th minute, redemption followed swiftly. Van Dijk rose to meet Alexis Mac Allister’s corner just three minutes later, sealing a vital victory.“In the 18th minute, Mohamed Salah sprinted away on the halfway line, accelerating towards the West Ham area and caressing a perfectly weighted pass to Diaz, who had the simple task of slotting home from six yards,” the club noted.Liverpool could secure their 20th English league championship as early as April 20 if they defeat Leicester and Arsenal slip up at Ipswich.Elsewhere, Tottenham’s domestic woes deepened as Wolves cruised to victory at Molineux.

MUMBAI: A balmy Mumbai evening turned into a time capsule on Sunday a week back as Barcelona and Real Madrid legends rekindled one of football’s fiercest rivalries.While the scoreline read 2-0 in favour of the Real Madrid Leyendas, the night was much more than just goals. It was a celebration of football’s enduring legacy.Fans at the DY Patil Stadium in Navi Mumbai may not have filled every seat, but those in attendance were treated to a surreal experience.FIFA World Cup and UEFA Champions League winners graced the pitch. Xavi Hernandez , Rivaldo , Carles Puyol for Barcelona, and Luis Figo , Fernando Morientes, and Michael Owen for Madrid.Though older and past their competitive prime, the skill, footballing IQ, and passion were unmistakably intact.The match saw Morientes strike early with a trademark finish in the 15th minute, followed by David Barral doubling Madrid’s lead midway through the second half.Despite the deficit, Barça responded with composure and flair, orchestrated by Xavi and spearheaded by a lively Rivaldo.Phillip Cocu made his long-awaited return in a Blaugrana jersey, while Javier Saviola - who sported colours for both clubs in his playing days - added bursts of energy. Yet, the Catalans couldn’t find the finishing touch.On the Madrid side, the ball gravitated towards Figo, who looked sharp and determined, still very much the heart of Los Blancos.Every touch from the Portuguese legend was met with thunderous cheers or emphatic boos, depending on the fan allegiance, proof that the rivalry, though friendly in nature, still runs deep.What stood out beyond the game was the atmosphere in the stands. Indian fans, many of whom grew up idolising these players, sang, waved club banners, and relived memories from a golden era.Despite the rivalry, camaraderie was in abundance.Barca and Madrid fans shared stands, clicked pictures for each other, and engaged in healthy banter, a rare sight for a fixture historically defined by tension.While the match saw passionate attendance, the reach was limited: advertising, ticket pricing, and scheduling played a role.For such events to serve as a launchpad for football’s growth in India, there is a need for broader awareness, grassroots engagement, and structured interaction between legends and local players or coaches.Ultimately, Mumbai witnessed more than a match.It was a reminder of football’s power to inspire and unite. It was an evening where legends walked again and a generation of fans got a glimpse of their heroes not through screens, but in the flesh.","A week ago in Mumbai, football legends from Barcelona and Real Madrid reignited their rivalry in an exhibition match.

Kolkata: If winning is a habit, trust Mohun Bagan SG to make it a magical monotony at home this season.Let them face the biggest of challenges, let them have all sorts of odds stacked against them and let them be forced to trail with a title at stake. But invariably and unflinchingly, expect Jose Molina’s men to find a way out of the crisis and have the last laugh. Bengaluru FC learnt this in quite a compelling way at the Salt Lake Stadium. Gerard Zaragoza’s visitors were welcomed to the Bagan’s formidable fortress with a giant tifo from the home fans — “Champion’s home, entry prohibited.”Yet they silenced the thunderous crowd when Alberto Rodriguez was forced into conceding an own goal while dealing with Ryan Williams’ centre in the 49th minute.Jason Cummings’ penalty in the 72nd minute and Jamie Maclaren’s poacher’s goal six minutes into the first half of extra time were all Bagan required to script a turnaround in a 2-1 win here on Saturday and become the second team after Mumbai City FC to complete the Indian Super League double.A year ago, Bagan lost a similar opportunity to Mumbai City at the same place. But this season they seemed to be a different beast, assuming a juggernaut crushing one opponent after another at home to stretch their winning run to 14 matches. Two months after sealing their back-to-back Shield, they deservedly lifted the ISL Cup in front of 59,112 spectators.It’s quite a journey for Molina’s men. Nine months ago, BFC inflicted the heaviest defeat on them (0-3), putting Molina’s Bagan project under serious question mark. Now claiming the double at BFC’s expense should come as completion of a circle for the winners.Bagan began in a way culled straight from their playbook, setting the alarm bells ringing in the all-Indian rival defence with some trademark moves from the wings. Having somehow managed to weather that storm, BFC started to establish a more recognizable rhythm. BFC duly and deservedly went ahead soon after the restart. It started with another incisive run from Ryan Williams down the right and the Australian delivered an inviting cross. Rodriguez ended up miskicking it into his own.Molina sought intervention from the bench. The introduction of Ashique Kuruniyan and Sahal Abdul Samad brought pace and panache to the attack. When Cummings swivelled to take aim, it looked destined for a goal but Gurpreet denied him. But BFC caved in to Bagan’s constant pressure.As Maclaren tried to get past Chinglensana Singh following Cummings’ centre, the ball touched the BFC centre-back’s hands, forcing referee Senthil Nathan to point to the spot. Cummings made no mistake in beating Gurpreet.Maclaren then provided the coup de grace.",Mohun Bagan beat Bengaluru FC 2-1 to complete the ISL Shield and Cup double.

""(Madrid) have a match tomorrow but we're only looking at ourselves, three points is good and we had a great week.""""In the end what is important in these games are three points,"" Barcelona defender Eric Garcia told DAZN. ""I think this is the type of game where the league is won... we're top of the table, which is where we want to be, and today we could extend that distance a bit.""The match was a reversal of fortunes from December when Leganes won 1-0 at Barcelona's home ground.Leganes created the best chance of a lackluster first half when Dani Raba set up Adria Altimira, whose shot was saved by Barcelona goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny.Barcelona suffered a setback when defender Alejandro Balde was forced off with a muscular injury before halftime.""Balde is not so good...

PANAJI: Two years after withdrawing a bid to host the AFC Asian Cup 2027, the All India Football Federation ( AIFF ) has now officially shown interest in hosting the 2031 edition of Asian football’s most prestigious national team tournament.With Praful Patel as president, India had launched an ambitious bid in 2020 to host the Asian Cup 2027. However, when the new executive committee took charge in 2022 with former India goalkeeper Kalyan Chaubey as president, the first major decision was to withdraw the bid, leaving Saudi Arabia as the only country left in the fray.Now, AIFF has officially notified the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) of its desire to organise the quadrennial event. Besides India, six others have expressed interest in hosting the continental showpiece. It includes Australia, Indonesia, South Korea, Kuwait, United Arab Emirates and a joint bid from Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan.While UAE, Australia, South Korea, Kuwait and Indonesia (jointly with three other countries in 2007) have all hosted the Asian Cup in the past, the Central Asian countries and India, if selected, will host the tournament for the first time.The decision is expected at the AFC Congress in 2026.",All India Football Federation (AIFF) has officially shown interest in hosting the 2031 edition of Asian football’s most prestigious national team tournament.

KOLKATA: Football , like life, moves in cycles. As Mohun Bagan SG and Bengaluru FC (BFC) prepare to bring down the curtain on the 2024-2025 season of Indian Super League (ISL) at the Salt Lake Stadium on Saturday, the two finalists will also relish the opportunity of completing a cycle of their journey in their own way.Mohun Bagan coach Jose Molina is someone who never lives in the past. But as he was sitting next to his Bengaluru counterpart Gerard Zaragoza during Friday’s news conference, it was tempting to take his mind to that September 28 evening when his team capitulated 0-3 at the Sree Kanteerava Stadium, their heaviest defeat of the league this term.Having lost the Durand Cup final earlier, the just-arrived Spanish coach was staring at uncertain times until his team turned things around in a record-breaking run and took the form of a juggernaut. Facing BFC again, the incentive is now greater for Molina and his League Shield winners at home -- a maiden ISL ‘double’ in the club’s history.Bagan missed a similar opportunity at home a year ago having lost the final to Mumbai City. At their formidable fortress where they are yet to taste defeat in the league, it would be a mammoth upset for them to be condemned to the periphery of a title-decider again.Zaragoza’s BFC, however, will enter the final with the battle-hardened look of a team, with hunger and determination to finish the season with a flourish. Not long ago BFC looked to be a team fearfully ambitious to give Bagan a run for their money but they lost the plot following a dreadful run in Janunary.Zaragoza, however, reflected on a brutal, wounding result that had happened further back to make sense of the occasion.“Last year, (it was) another April 11, we played Bagan at home and lost 0-4. Now we are here in the final and facing them. This is the difference for my team between then and now,” the BFC coach maintained on Friday.“Now we are in the final mood,” he added with a smile.Bagan will certainly have the edge with the support of their proverbial 12th man — the fans. It will be quite an audition for BFC at the Salt Lake Stadium. Yet, don’t expect it to be an uneven contest. Sunil Chhetri , even at the fag end of his illustrious career, is still showing hunger for goals and his stellar form, by Zaragoza’s own admission, is giving him a good headache whether to start him or use him as substitute.Bagan aim to take the centrestage this time. But Chhetri & Co. will be there, armed with some old tricks, to put a spanner in Bagan’s ambitions.",Mohun Bagan SG and Bengaluru FC will meet in the final of the 2024-2025 Indian Super League (ISL) The two finalists will also relish the opportunity of completing a cycle of their journey in their own way.

It was Pascal Wehrlein ’s day in Miami on Saturday when, amid a lot of chaos and confusion in the results, he was eventually declared the winner. Nissan ’s Norman Nato was leading the race, and Pascal would have been second if the former hadn’t been disqualified first and then sent back to sixth position for misuse of Attack Mode. Wehrlein’s win is still deserving, to say the least, but if he hadn’t won, he wouldn’t have stopped thinking about his “bad luck.”Pascal Wehrlein had shown quick strategic thinking when a three-car collision led to red flags and brought the speeding Formula E cars to a screeching halt. As the debris was cleared and the race resumed, the German-Mauritian driver came from behind the scenes to steal second position after Norman Nato. But as luck would have it, he was promoted to the top spot after a change in the final results.After the win, Pascal Wehrlein took to his Instagram page to share the historic moment with his fans. Sharing a picture of himself standing on his TAG Heuer Porsche after his win, he captioned the post, “P1 in Miami! (trophy emoji). Keeping the mood high and working hard is the best killer for bad luck - let’s go @porsche.motorsport - back in the game!”Wehrlein revealed he was having negative thoughts after ending up in ninth position in Qualifying at the Homestead-Miami Speedway. Talking to the media after the win, he said, as per Motorsportweek.com, “We might have been good enough for a podium, somewhere between P3 and P5, if it was a normal race, which is still a good result considering that again in qualifying today we were unlucky that the car in front of us went into the gravel in Turn 12 and put all the dirt on track when I was the next car behind him. So it ruined my lap because I was purple and going for the fastest lap. So actually, after the qualifying today, I thought my bad luck would never end this season. So I take the win because, for one time, we can also be lucky.”The 30-year-old is the winner of last year’s Formula E Championship. He had a terrible start to the new season by suffering a crash at the Sao Paulo E-Prix. However, he managed a third spot on the podium at the Mexico E-Prix but went on to face a streak of disappointments in the following races in the Jeddah double-header, where he finished 15th and 8th in the two races, respectively.Also Read: Who is Miami E-Prix winner Pascal Wehrlein?

Pascal Wehrlein’s journey to Formula E

Pascal Wehrlein may have clinched victory at the Miami E-Prix thanks to a dramatic turn of events, but make no mistake—his win was far from a fluke. The TAG Heuer Porsche driver is the reigning Formula E World Champion, having secured the title last season, and his latest triumph is yet another testament to his skill, timing, and tactical brilliance.Pascal Wehrlein’s win in Miami followed a chaotic three-car crash that temporarily threw the race into disarray. Amid the confusion, the German driver seized the opportunity to power through to the front in spectacular fashion.But this win wasn’t just about being in the right place at the right time. Wehrlein had already proven his pace earlier this season by registering the fastest lap in both the Sao Paulo and Mexico City E-Prix. Miami was less a lucky break and more a long-overdue reward for his consistency and form.Currently sitting third in the Drivers’ Championship standings, Wehrlein boasts of 1 win, 2 podiums, and 51 points this season. In total, his career stats now include 8 wins, 14 podium finishes, and 8 pole positions.The German-Mauritian driver started his racing career in karts in 2003 at the age of nine. He went on to enter the Formula 3 Euro Series in 2012 and then the DTM, before finally landing at Formula 1 . There he started as a reserve driver for Mercedes in 2014 and went on to make his F1 debut two years later with Manor Racing. He moved to Sauber in 2017 and even had a tiny stint at Ferrari before switching to Formula E.Since switching from Formula 1 to Formula E with Mahindra Racing in 2018, Wehrlein has steadily carved his path. After two seasons with Mahindra, he joined TAG Heuer Porsche in 2021. Though his first season with the team was winless, he quickly turned things around. With three E-Prix victories across the last two seasons, his Miami win only adds to a growing tally—one that seems set to climb even higher with many more races left on the calendar.More recently, Wehrlein has expanded into endurance racing , making his debut at the 2025 24 Hours of Daytona. He’s also set to compete in the prestigious 24 Hours of Le Mans.Off the track, Wehrlein has a stunning wife, Sibel and the couple are parents to their two-year-old daughter, Soleya.",Pascal Wehrlein is the reigning Formula E World Champion.

What is Attack Mode?

The 2025 Formula E Miami E-Prix was an action-packed thriller filled with drama, crashes, and strategy twists. The race saw multiple drivers penalised for Attack Mode infringements, while a major crash brought out both the Safety Car and eventually a red flag. Amid the chaos, Pascal Wehrlein produced a stunning come-from-behind victory for TAG Heuer Porsche.The drama began early as Norman Nato, driving for Nissan, secured his first Julius Baer Pole Position after edging out former teammate Jake Dennis (Andretti) in qualifying. But the final race quickly turned wild.During the final race, a fierce three-way battle between Jake Hughes, Sébastien Buemi, and Max Günther ended in disaster when Hughes smashed into the barrier at the tight 8-9 chicane. Günther and Mitch Evans were caught up in the incident. The Safety Car was deployed, followed by a red flag that halted the race and temporarily froze António Félix Da Costa’s momentum.After a 20-minute delay, the race resumed with a standing start, Da Costa now in the lead. From Lap 23, more than half the field dived in for their final Attack Mode activations, setting the stage for a frantic finish.Wehrlein, who started ninth, managed his strategy perfectly and surged through the field. He clocked the fastest lap of the race (1:25.821) and completed the distance in 4:19.723 to claim victory and 26 championship points.Lucas Di Grassi (Lola Yamaha ABT) finished second, 5.619 seconds behind, while Da Costa (Porsche) held on for third.Nato Norman would have been the clear winner at the Miami E-Prix as he was leading the race after starting at the pole position. But his misuse of the Attack Mode led to his initial disqualification which juggled up the results drastically. He was eventually pushed to the 6th spot. The Attack Mode allows a Formula E driver to use a temporary boost of 50 kW power while driving through a designated zone on the circuit. The driver arms the Attack Mode by pressing a button on the steering wheel.","The 2025 Formula E Miami E-Prix was an action-packed thriller filled with drama, crashes, and strategy twists.

All about the race

The Qualifying race at the Miami E-Prix on Saturday was as unpredictable as it could be, especially for Nissan.

Dennis was also very close to António Félix Da Costa of TAG Heuer Porsche, who ended up in third place by a similarly slim margin. Robin Frijns of Envision Racing took fourth position, followed by Nyck de Vries in fifth.Qualifying on Saturday served up some of the biggest surprises as well. The most unexpected was Nissan’s in-form driver Oliver Rowland finishing 16th in Qualifying, as he had to abort his final lap due to an error at Turn 12. He has already won two of the four races this season.Sao Paulo E-Prix winner Mitch Evans of Jaguar TCS Racing also ended up in a less-than-impressive 14th position. Additionally, Jeddah E-Prix I winner Maximilian Günther of DS Penske came in last in Qualifying.Taylor Barnard of NEOM McLaren also faced disappointment.

The Miami E-Prix in Florida is set to bring the Homestead-Miami Speedway alive with the ultra fast electric race cars—combining high-octane entertainment with sustainability. As Formula E returns to this iconic circuit after a decade-long hiatus, race enthusiasts are eagerly anticipating high-speed action at the picturesque venue. Will Nissan’s Oliver Rowland and NEOM McLaren’s Taylor Barnard continue their season dominance at Miami, or will Jaguar TCS Racing’s Mitch Evans rise to the occasion with a win on U.S. soil? Only time will tell.The Miami E-Prix is one of only two single-header races remaining this season. The other is in Jakarta on June 21. Homestead-Miami Speedway is the fifth different venue in the USA to host a Formula E race—more than any other country.Saturday’s race will also mark the 137th race in Formula E history, and the 37th in the Gen3 Evo era. The new Gen3 Evo cars can hit 322 km/h and accelerate from 0 to 100 km/h in just 1.86 seconds—faster than a Formula 1 car.Interestingly, the winning margin in the final race of each weekend has been steadily increasing with 0.099s in Sao Paulo, 0.125s in Mexico and 0.286s and 0.439s in the Jeddah double header.Meanwhile, the polesitter has finished on the podium in the last three races, in stark contrast to the previous stretch where only 2 polesitters reached the podium in 12 races.When it comes to qualifying, Oliver Rowland and Maximilian Günther are the only drivers to have reached the duel stages in every round this season.

Formula E is now in its 11th season since its debut in 2014, and the electric motorsport has achieved impressive success, carving its own identity despite the dominance of Formula 1. One of the key indicators of this success is the growing grid of 11 teams and 22 drivers—one more than the 10 teams in F1. While drivers like Oliver Rowland and Pascal Wehrlein have previously tested their skills in F1, it seems they've found their true calling in the more sustainable and rapidly evolving Formula E.Oliver Rowland is currently leading the Formula E standings with 68 points, thanks to his victory at this season’s Mexico City E-Prix. Rowland had a brief stint with F1 team Williams in 2018 before transitioning to Formula E, where he raced for Mahindra Racing and then Nissan, ultimately making a name for himself with the Japanese team. Antonio Felix da Costa, driving for Porsche, is also a formidable force in the series. He currently sits in third place with 39 points this season, continuing to prove his prowess on the track.Maximilian Günther has made a strong impression after his move from Maserati MSG Racing to DS Penske. At the Jeddah E-Prix, Günther took pole position, posted the fastest lap, and ultimately clinched the victory.

The current Formula E season is in full swing, fueling even more excitement for this electrifying motorsport, where cars now accelerate from 0-60 mph in a jaw-dropping 1.82 seconds. With 11 teams and 22 drivers battling it out across 16 races at 10 iconic global locations, the season will run through to July 27. Since its inception, the Nissan Formula E Team has led the charge, but a number of other teams are rapidly closing the gap in a sport that blends speed, innovation, and sustainability.All teams are currently using the Formula E Gen3 Evo cars fitted with Hankook tires. These cars can reach a top speed of 322 km/h—the fastest for any Formula E car—and accelerate even quicker than an F1 car. Needless to say, the Formula E fever is rapidly spreading among motorsport fans. Among the 11 teams, Nissan boasts 21 wins in 136 races, along with 50 podium finishes. Envision Racing, Jaguar TCS Racing , and Lola Yamaha ABT Formula E Team are also among the top contenders.Nissan recently added another victory to its impressive tally. Oliver Rowland steered the team to a win at Jeddah E-Prix II in February, marking their second victory of the season after the Mexico City E-Prix in January. Rowland is now joined by Norman Nato, who took a transfer from Andretti.Tag Heuer Porsche won the 2023–24 Formula E World Championship, thanks to Pascal Wehrlein. This year, he remains in top form, having recorded the fastest lap in two races. He has been joined by Antonio Felix da Costa, the Season 6 champion, who is also performing well, having won four out of five races last season. The team now has 12 wins and 25 podium finishes in 78 races.DS Penske is also having a strong season, with Maximilian Günther claiming a victory at the Jeddah E-Prix I after taking over as the lead driver. Günther dominated the weekend by securing pole position and recording the fastest lap. Jean-Éric Vergne, the other DS Penske driver, is expected to maintain his strong form this season.Jaguar TCS Racing started the season with a win.

The team now has 17 wins and 47 podium finishes in 115 races.Andretti Formula E Team has been around for a while, securing 11 wins and 37 podium finishes. Driver Jake Dennis continues to impress, and he is now joined by new addition Nico Mueller.Envision Racing is consistently among the top teams in Formula E, with 16 wins and 53 podiums in 136 races. Both drivers, Sébastien Buemi and Robin Frijns, are experienced and remain in top form.Neom McLaren has 8 wins and 29 podium finishes in 91 races. Taylor Barnard, who became the youngest driver in Formula E history at 19, is now a full-time driver for the team, alongside Sam Bird.Maserati MSG Racing has been taking a slower approach, with 10 wins and 28 podium finishes in 136 races. The team has added two new drivers: Jake Hughes and Stoffel Vandoorne.The team recently faced a setback when Nico Mueller moved to Andretti after contributing significantly to the team’s success.

Who founded Formula E

All eyes are currently on Formula 1 , as the season kicked off last month in Australia. However, there's another motorsport series that deserves just as much attention—one that not only thrills but is also in tune with the global movement for sustainability. Enter Formula E, the FIA-recognized single-seater world championship. Like Formula 1, it showcases high-speed racing, but with a key distinction: it’s environmentally conscious. Formula E uses all-electric cars, offering a cleaner, greener alternative to traditional motorsports while also driving innovation in the electric vehicle sector.Formula E cars are smaller, lighter, and require far fewer tire changes over the course of the season, which helps minimize their environmental footprint. And if you’re wondering whether these electric racers can deliver the same level of excitement as Formula 1, consider this: the Generation 3 Formula E car can reach speeds exceeding 100 km/h, proving that sustainability and speed can indeed go hand in hand.The ABB FIA Formula E Championship is currently in its 11th season, with the next race—the Miami ePrix—set for April 12. The season will run until July 27, with many more thrilling races scheduled across the globe.Formula 1 has been around since 1950 and has only evolved into hybrid vehicles relying on fossil fuels like E10 fuel (a mix of 90% petrol and 10% renewable ethanol). In contrast, Formula E is the motorsport of the 21st century after coming into existence in 2014. These races feature all-electric cars that run on powertrains converting energy from a battery into motion.One of the most striking differences between the two sports is how the cars handle tire changes. In Formula 1, teams often swap tires multiple times during a single race due to varying track conditions. In Formula E, however, teams are only allowed to change tires twice throughout the entire championship. The tires used in Formula E are made from natural rubber and recycled fibers, and are specifically designed to perform well in all weather conditions.Despite this difference, Formula E is by no means inferior. While a Formula 1 car can reach speeds in excess of 350 km/h, the new Formula E Gen3 Evo can reach 322 km/h, but it can accelerate faster than a F1 car. It can go from 0-100 km/h in 1.86 seconds., faster than many Formula 1 cars.Although both series use the same chassis, battery, and tires, the real performance differences come from the powertrains provided by each team. There is one aspect where Formula 1 still holds an edge, primarily due to the electric car's battery limitations. As the battery depletes, an electric car loses speed, requiring a pit stop to recharge in a flash. A Formula 1 car, on the other hand, can maintain top speed even with a quarter tank of fuel.Additionally, Formula E cars must be kept light—around 284 kg for the battery, which accounts for one-third of the car's weight that’s fixed at 840 kg, including the driver.Despite the technical differences, Formula E has its own appeal. Even Red Bull driver Max Verstappen has acknowledged how difficult it can be to drive the RB21. In comparison, electric cars in Formula E are simpler, with single-speed transmission and no gear shifts necessary, unlike the multiple gears in a F1 car.Currently, Formula E features 11 teams, with 22 drivers. Unlike Formula 1, where the top speeds are often the focus, Formula E records are typically based on average race speeds. The fastest race in Formula E history took place in Cape Town in 2023, with an average speed of 132.2 km/h.Practice sessions are held on Friday and Saturday, lasting 30 minutes each, giving drivers a chance to fine-tune their performance.Qualifying: Drivers are split into two groups based on their championship standing. Each group has a 10-minute session to set the fastest lap at 300 kW. The top 4 from each group then advance to the ""duels"" stage, where drivers face off head-to-head at 350 kW in a series of quarter-finals, semi-finals, and a final. The winner of the final claims pole position.The top ten drivers receive points using the standard FIA system (25–18–15–12–10–8–6–4–2–1). The pole position winner earns an additional 3 points, while the driver setting the fastest lap (if they finish in the top ten) receives 1 point.Drivers can deploy a combined 8 minutes of Attack Mode during the race. It provides additional power, activated by driving through a designated area of the circuit off the racing line. All Attack Modes must be used before the end of the race.A new feature has been introduced this season. It requires all drivers to make a mandatory 30-second pit stop to recharge their car's batteries at 600 kW. This adds 3.85 kWh of energy (around 10% more) to be used for the remainder of the race.Formula E was founded by Spanish businessman Alejandro Agag, who serves as the company's Chairman, while Jeff Dodds is the Chief Executive Officer. Many may not realize that Warner Bros. Discovery is among its shareholders.","Formula E is the FIA-recognized single-seater world championship.

Tokyo:

Pune: For Indian women’s tennis team captain Vishaal Uppal , it was “mission accomplished” after his team secured their World Group Playoff berth in the Billie Jean King Cup .“At the start, I sent the team a message saying our mission is Project Playoff. And it’s mission accomplished,” Uppal said on Saturday after India beat South Korea 2-1 in their last round-robin match to finish in the top two in Asia-Oceania Group 1 .“We have just proven when we become ‘We’, what we can achieve. It’s truly amazing. I know I was tough on them this week. I pushed them. But we had Project Playoff. It was a team effort,” said the former Davis Cupper.Shrivalli Rashmikaa played a stellar role as she won all her five singles matches, but Uppal emphasised on the team bonding, which he said played a vital role in lifting the Hyderabad girl’s performance. “She beat a lot of higher ranked players this week,” he said.“We’re playing a team competition, and for her to come out and perform like that, I think the credit has to go to the entire team,” he said. “When Shrivalli beat (Hong Yi) Cody Wong (of Hong Kong) the other day and Ankita ran on to the court and hugged her. That says a lot.” Ankita Raina played her part in the team’s success, combining with fellow senior Prarthana Thombare , to clinch the decisive doubles rubber against Korea. “It was deja-vu for me. When it became one-all against Korea, I remembered the mindset I had in Dubai for doubles, and tried to keep that momentum,” she said, referring to the last time India advanced to the playoffs in 2020.“And we were aggressive because as we all know that in doubles, the momentum can change quickly,” she said, adding, “We really came together. We are traveling and playing by ourselves, but there’s this one week every year when we come together as a team.”Prarthana, Asian Games doubles bronze medallist with Sania Mirza in 2014, hit the winning shot — a sizzling forehand service return down the line. And she was modest about it all.“Sahaja (Yamalapalli) and Shrivalli were fighting their hearts out. And it gives us the confidence,” the 30-year-old from Barshi said. “As much as it is ours, it is each and every person who wants to play tennis. It’s their win as well.”Ena Shibahara and Shuko Aoyama defeated Kayla Cross and Rebecca Marino 6-3, 5-7, 6-2 in the decisive doubles match to secure Japan a spot in the Billie Jean King Cup Finals on Sunday.The BJK Cup Finals will be played in Shenzhen in September.","India beat South Korea 2-1 in their last round-robin match to finish in the top two in Asia-Oceania Group 1.

Alcaraz wins

Monte Carlo Masters

Carlos Alcaraz had an outstanding start to his clay-court season last week, clinching the Monte Carlo title on Sunday for the first time in his career.After missing this Masters 1000 event last year, he earned the full 1,000 ranking points when he beat Lorenzo Musetti in the final, elevating his total from 6,720 to 7,720 points.As a result, Alcaraz moves one place in the latest ATP rankings (April1 4), moving up from No. 3 to No. 2, surpassing Alexander Zverev, who lost his first match in Monte Carlo this year. Zverev’s ranking points drop from 7,645 to 7,595, causing him to fall one place.This marks Alcaraz's first return to the Top 2 since October 28 last year, when he was also ranked No. 2; he had spent 23 consecutive weeks at No. 3 since then. Overall, this is his 89th week in the Top 2, with 36 weeks at No. 1 and 53 weeks at No. 2.Alcaraz also narrows the gap between him and current No. 1 Jannik Sinner, who is suspended presently, from 3,610 points (10,330 to 6,720) to 2,210 points (9,930 to 7,720).Sinner missed Monte Carlo while defending semi-final points as he serves a three-month suspension for two failed dope tests last year. Although Alcaraz can’t overtake him before Sinner returns on the tour in Rome, winning both Barcelona and Madrid in the coming weeks could reduce that gap to just 720 points, putting the No. 1 ranking within reach in Italy.In addition to Alcaraz and Zverev's place swap, there was movement elsewhere in the ATP Top 10: Alex de Minaur made the biggest jump, climbing from No. 10 to No. 7 — just one spot shy of his career-high of No. 6 — after reaching the semifinals of his second Masters 1000 event.Andrey Rublev also rose from No. 9 back to No. 8, while Daniil Medvedev returned to the Top 10 after being outside for two weeks, moving from No. 11 to No. 9. This marked the 2021 US Open champion's first absence from the elite group in over two years, dating back to February 2023.Meanwhile, Musetti closed in on a Top 10 debut, climbing from No. 16 to No. 11 — surpassing his previous career - high of No. 15 — after reaching the finals of his first Masters 1000 event. He’s now just 15 points behind the No. 10-ranked Ruud, with scores of 3,215 to 3,200.""I'm just really happy to have won Monte Carlo for the first time,"" Alcaraz said. ""It's been a really difficult week with a lot of difficult situations. I'm really proud of myself, how I've dealt with everything. It's been a really difficult month for me on the court and outside. Coming here and seeing how the whole hard work has paid off, I'm really happy.""This victory represents Alcaraz's first clay court success since his French Open triumph last season, with his only other clay court appearance resulting in a silver medal at the Paris Olympics.Musetti, appearing in his first Masters 1000 final after defeating top 10 players Stefanos Tsitsipas and Alex de Minaur, started strongly but faced physical challenges as the match progressed.The Italian received medical treatment for his right leg when trailing 0-3 in the final set, though he continued to play despite the injury.""It is not the way I would have wanted to win a match,"" Alcaraz said. ""Lorenzo's been through a really tough week, long and intense matches. I feel sorry for him, one of the best results he has done. To end like this is not easy. Hopefully it's not serious and he's 100 percent soon.""""It was probably one of my best tournaments so far,"" Musetti said, who won bronze at last year's Olympics behind Alcaraz and gold medalist Novak Djokovic. ""I'm disappointed I couldn't finish the match in the best way, for the crowd. You deserve it so I will keep going and try and come back for revenge.""The match began with Musetti dropping his opening service game but immediately breaking back and taking the first set, capitalising on Alcaraz's six unforced errors.Alcaraz's game improved significantly in the second set, which he won convincingly before completing the victory with a dominant final set.Both players will continue their clay court preparations at the Barcelona Open next week as they build toward the French Open at the end of May.","Carlos Alcaraz won the Monte Carlo Masters for the first time in his career.

Carlos Alcaraz captured his first Monte Carlo Masters title on Sunday with a commanding 3-6, 6-1, 6-0 win over Italy’s Lorenzo Musetti , marking his sixth Masters 1000 crown and most significant title since Wimbledon 2024.The 21-year-old Spaniard, a four-time Grand Slam champion, overcame a slow start to dominate the final two sets, showcasing his trademark intensity and athleticism. Alcaraz had lost in the opening round on his only previous appearance at Monte Carlo in 2022 but returned stronger this year.“It’s been a really difficult week and a tough month for me, both on and off the court,” said Alcaraz. “I’m proud of how I dealt with everything.”Musetti, playing in his first Masters 1000 final, started brightly, rallying from an early break to take the opening set. However, the Italian began struggling with a leg issue early in the third set, requiring medical attention at 0-3. From that point, Alcaraz never looked back, sealing the decider without dropping a game.Despite the defeat, Musetti earned a rankings boost to World No. 11 and valuable experience ahead of the French Open . “It was probably one of my best tournaments so far,” he said. “I’m disappointed I couldn’t finish stronger, but I’ll come back for revenge.”Alcaraz will rise to World No. 2, overtaking Alexander Zverev, as the clay-court season intensifies. With Roland Garros on the horizon, his Monte Carlo triumph sets the tone for another strong title push.","Carlos Alcaraz wins first Monte Carlo Masters title.

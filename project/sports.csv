'We're going for the win': Jeetan Patel backs England despite massive deficit

Poll Is No. 4 the ideal batting position for Shubman Gill? Yes, definitely Maybe No, he should open No, he should bat lower

NEW DELHI: Former India captain Sourav Ganguly hailed Shubman Gill 's majestic 269 in the second Test against England as “an absolute masterclass,” while suggesting that Gill has finally found his ideal position at No.4 in the Test batting order.Ganguly took to X to praise the young skipper, writing: ""An absolute masterclass from Gill... just flawless. One of the best innings I have seen in England in any era. So much improvement in the last few months. Probably opening was not his place in Test cricket.""Gill, who began his career as an opener, stepped into the pivotal No.4 slot previously held by icons Virat Kohli and Sachin Tendulkar - and made it his own. His record-breaking double century on Thursday helped India post a mammoth 587 all out, before the bowlers reduced England to 77 for 3 at stumps on Day 2, giving the visitors a commanding 510-run lead.""This is the result of work I put in before the series,"" Gill said after the day's play. ""I’m glad it’s paying off.""The 25-year-old became the first Indian and Asian captain to score a double hundred in a Test in England. He also surpassed Kohli’s 254* as the highest score by an Indian Test captain, and Tendulkar’s 241* as the highest by an Indian outside Asia. His knock also eclipsed Sunil Gavaskar’s 221 at The Oval as India’s top Test score in England.India lost the series opener at Headingley despite Gill’s 147, but with his masterclass in Birmingham, they are now in pole position to level the series.As Ganguly put it, ""A Test to win for India.""",Former India captain Sourav Ganguly hails Shubman Gill's 269 in the second Test against England.

Poll Do you believe Shubman Gill will achieve a triple century in his career? Yes, it's only a matter of time No, it's very challenging Possibly, if conditions are right Not sure

TimesofIndia.com in Birmingham: ""I felt I could have, now looking back at it… the kind of shot I played, I felt I could have batted a little bit more,"" Shubman Gill had said on the eve of the second Test when asked about the lessons from the Leeds defeat. Even after scoring a flowing 147 on Test captaincy debut, the right-hander carried the feeling of dissatisfaction. He wanted more. He has always wanted more.Even as a youngster slogging it out in the U-16 age-group circuit in Punjab, Gill was pulled up by his father Lakhwinder Singh for not converting a hundred into a big one. Even a double wasn't celebrated at home as the Gills felt the triple was there for the taking. That feeling of never being satisfied has always been there, right from his preparation to eventual outings in the middle. Even after the hundred versus England in Vizag last year, the youngster was worried about facing his father who would have surely given him an earful for getting out while playing a reverse-sweep.So it was quite natural that his concentration and application was 200 percent when he took guard on Day 2 of the Edgbaston Test with Ravindra Jadeja at the other end. With the pitch not playing any tricks, all Gill had to do was bat normally and just stay out there. There were far too many traps - for the mistimed drive, the bumper - laid by Ben Stokes but the 25-year-old was ready with astute responses.The template of standing way outside the crease to Chris Woakes continued and he used the depth of the crease while facing Brydon Carse, Josh Tongue and Stokes. One confident stride at a time, he went past 150, cruised past 200, breached 250 and was looking set for a triple before he miscued his bread and butter shot - the trademark pull - to Ollie Pope in the ring. Prior to that shot, he exercised a lot of control in what was a flawless 269-run knock.There were no wild celebrations when he crossed 150 and 250 as just a raise of the bat followed but the emotions clearly got the better of him when he went past the 200-run mark. This was the first time he climbed Mt. 200 in Indian whites and two punches in the air later, the helmet came off, arms went up in celebration before he went down on one knee to swing the helmet one more time. It almost felt like he forgot his signature bow but he didn't, and acknowledged the applause for what was a terrific knock.Conditions were ideal to bat and Gill ensured there was no lapse in concentration this time around. He focussed hard, stuck to his strengths and became the first Indian batter to score a 250+ outside the sub-continent. He also ended the long wait of a double hundred by an Indian batter in England and went past Sunil Gavaskar's 50-year-old record of highest score (221) by an Indian batter here.The way he was batting, the Virender Sehwag's individual score of 309 and even the 319 was very much in sight. The chanceless hand switched to cruise control and he was now reaping rewards for the discipline shown on the opening day and the second morning of the Test. The bat was close to the pad, the footwork remained assured and his forward defence remained rock solid. England bowlers toiled hard but couldn't breach his defence, struggled to flirt with his edges and weren't able to induce a false shot.It was a knock which would have given both captain and batter Gill a lot of satisfaction, and he would now hope the feeling remains mutual when Gill Sr rings him at the end of day's play. Yet, there might be a sense of disappointment. Not because he fell short of a triple hundred but because of the shot which ended his marathon knock. A shot the Gills had mastered by spending hours on cemented tracks.As far as Gill is concerned, the 25-year-old will remember this for a very long time because it surely helped him walk the ""I want to be the best batter in the series"" talk.",Shubman Gill scored 269 runs on Day 2 of the second Test at Edgbaston. The 25-year-old became the first Indian batter to score a 250+ outside the sub- continent.

It was a historic effort that saw him become the first Indian and Asian captain to score a Test double hundred in England, and also the highest individual scorer for India on English soil, surpassing Sunil Gavaskar’s 221 at The Oval in 1979.Gill's effort was well supported by Yashasvi Jaiswal (87) and Ravindra Jadeja (89), with the latter partnering Gill in a 203-run sixth-wicket stand.

India's 250-plus scores in away Tests:

Youngest to score a Test double hundred as India captain

It was a day dominated by India and their captain Shubman Gill , who scored a majestic, record-breaking double century. The 25-year-old's knock powered India to a massive first-innings total of 587 and cemented his place among the game's greats.By stumps on Day 2 of the second Test, England found themselves staring at a mountain, reeling at 77 for 3, still trailing by 510 runs.Gill’s monumental 269 was not just a career-best - it was a statistical spectacle that obliterated long-standing Indian records in overseas Tests. In only his second Test as captain, Gill surpassed legends such as Virat Kohli, Sachin Tendulkar and Sunil Gavaskar, compiling a catalogue of elite milestones in one extraordinary knock.""I worked on a few things before the series,"" Gill said after the day's play. ""Looking at the results, they are working for me.""Gill’s 269 now stands as the highest score by an Indian Test captain, overtaking Kohli’s unbeaten 254 against South Africa in 2019. It is only the second double hundred by an Indian captain in an overseas Test, after Kohli’s 200 in Antigua in 2016.In England, Gill’s effort is now the highest score by an Indian batter, bettering Gavaskar’s 221 at The Oval in 1979 and Dravid’s 217 in 2002.His 269 also tops Sachin Tendulkar’s 241* at Sydney in 2004 as the highest Test score by an Indian outside Asia.Overall, Gill’s 269 is the third-highest away Test score by an Indian, behind only Sehwag’s 309 (Multan, 2004) and Dravid’s 270 (Rawalpindi, 2004). It's the seventh-highest Test score for India across all venues.He also became only the fifth batter ever, after Sehwag, Tendulkar, Rohit Sharma and Chris Gayle (the lone non-Indian), to notch up double hundreds in both Tests and ODIs.At Edgbaston, only Graeme Smith (277, 2003) and Zaheer Abbas (274, 1971) had scored more as visiting batters. Gill’s 269 is now the third-highest score at the venue by a tourist, and the eighth-highest overall by a visiting batter in England.Gill is now one of only seven players to hit centuries in each of their first two Tests as captain. Indians Vijay Hazare, Gavaskar and Kohli had achieved this before. At 25 years and 298 days, he is also the second-youngest Indian skipper to post a double ton, after MAK Pataudi.Only Graeme Smith scored a double century in England at a younger age among captains, doing so twice in 2003 at age 22.309 – Virender Sehwag vs PAK (Multan, 2004)270 – Rahul Dravid vs PAK (Rawalpindi, 2004)269 – Shubman Gill vs ENG (Edgbaston, 2025)254 – Sehwag vs PAK (Lahore, 2006)23y 39d - MAK Pataudi vs ENG, Delhi, 196425y 298d - Shubman Gill vs ENG, Edgbaston, 202526y 189d - Sachin Tendulkar vs NZ, Ahmedabad, 199927y 260d - Virat Kohli vs WI, North Sound, 2016Among Indian captains, only Kohli (7 double tons) has more, but Gill's has a unique prestige - it came outside the subcontinent, the first ever by an Indian skipper in SENA countries.","India captain Shubman Gill smashed a record-breaking double century.

Poll How do you view Rishabh Pant's reaction to Harry Brook's slow batting? Completely justified Not justified at all

India’s dominant display with the bat on Day 2 of the second Test against England was followed by a fiery end to proceedings, as Rishabh Pant took centre stage, as he made his feelings clear on England batter Harry Brook After India piled up a mammoth 587, thanks to captain Shubman Gill’s sensational 269, England were left on the back foot early in their reply. By stumps, they were reduced to 77/3 in 20 overs, still trailing by a daunting 510 runs.Openers Zak Crawley and Ben Duckett departed cheaply, followed by Ollie Pope, as India’s pacers led by Akash Deep (2/36) struck early. Joe Root (18*) and Harry Brook (30*) were at the crease at close of play.However, it was Brook’s extremely slow approach at the crease that flared up the visitors, particularly Rishabh Pant. The England batter took an unusually long time to get ready between deliveries, constantly stepping away, adjusting his gear and helmet, and slowing the game’s rhythm. This did not go unnoticed by Pant, who was visibly frustrated behind the stumps.Pant was seen repeatedly gesturing and eventually gestured to the umpire to raise his concerns.India captain Shubman Gill also looked visibly irritated with the delay, urging the umpires to step in and prevent England from breaking the home side’s momentum.Pant, who scored centuries in both innings in the first Test for India got out for an underwhelming 25 from 42 balls. The keeper was also heard lauding Brook's presence of mind, but nevertheless complained to the umpire, forcing him to step in. ""What is this? Every ball? He's taking time to get ready every ball,"" Pant launched his complaint with arms outstretched. The subsequent ball from Ravindra Jadeja was comfortably defended defended by the Englishman.The incident came at a time when India were pressing hard for more wickets, and England appeared keen to absorb time and prevent a collapse. The umpires, while initially silent, were seen in conversation with Brook shortly after Pant’s complaints.As Day 3 beckons, the verbal spark might just add another layer of drama to an already charged series.","Rishabh Pant took exception to Harry Brook's slow batting on Day 2.

England assistant coach Jeetan Patel admitted the mental and physical toll of a long day in the field while praising Shubman Gill ’s brilliance after stumps on Day 2 of the second Test at Edgbaston.“Shubman Gill put on a masterclass,” said Patel, acknowledging the Indian captain’s majestic 269 that propelled India to a commanding total of 587. England’s bowlers were forced to toil for 150 overs in the first innings, with little assistance from the surface throughout the day.“150 overs out there for us… the new ball is doing a bit,” he said, pointing to the late swing and seam movement India’s pacers exploited with the second new ball under lights. It allowed the visitors to strike early, reducing England to 77 for 3 by stumps.Describing the current mood in the England camp, Patel said, “Tight minds and tight bodies at the moment. It’s physical as well as mental.” With England trailing by over 500 runs and the Test slipping away, he emphasised the need for recovery, adding, “Rest will be beneficial going forward.”While England struggled to get much out of the Edgbaston surface, Patel conceded that India’s bowlers made better use of the conditions. “India used the new ball really well,” he remarked.Looking ahead to Day 3, Patel suggested that batting might get a bit easier as the ball gets older. “Another day tomorrow and older ball has been softer and hasn’t done much,” he added, hopeful for a stronger showing from England’s batters.",Jeetan Patel praises Shubman Gill after stumps on Day 2 of the second Test at Edgbaston.

Poll Who made the biggest impact in the recent Test match? Akash Deep Shubman Gill

Tracing Moeen Ali's steps in Birmingham

NEW DELHI: The inclusion of Akash Deep in place of Jasprit Bumrah turned out to be a masterstroke for India and captain Shubman Gill . The pacer opened the bowling and conceded 12 runs in his first over, but when he returned for his second, he looked like a completely different bowler.He began the over with three dot balls before striking gold. Akash dismissed Ben Duckett for a duck with a length delivery outside off. Duckett attempted a punch but only managed a thick outside edge that flew straight to Gill at third slip.What followed was even more sensational — Akash struck again on the very next ball, removing Ollie Pope for a golden duck. Bowling full and angling in on off, he induced a thick leading edge from Pope’s attempted flick. The ball flew to KL Rahul at second slip, who juggled before completing the catch on the second attempt.Akash Deep erupted in celebration, leaping into the air and punching the sky, having delivered two crucial blows in two balls to put India on top.India had lost the opening Test at Headingley by five wickets and came into this match at Edgbaston trailing 0-1 in the five-match series.Earlier in the day, Shubman Gill produced a knock for the ages — a majestic 269 that propelled India to a commanding total of 587 in 151 overs.From a shaky 211/5, such a score seemed improbable. But Gill rose to the occasion with a career-best performance that will be remembered for years to come.Gill’s innings was a mix of grit, composure, and sheer class. He batted for over eight hours, crafting the highest-ever score by an Indian batter in Tests in England and the highest by an Indian Test captain. His knock was laced with 30 fours and three sixes, showcasing his technical precision in attack and defence alike.It was a defining effort that not only steadied India’s innings but also stamped Gill’s authority as a leader in red-ball cricket. His 269 is now the seventh-highest individual score by an Indian in Test history and made him only the second Indian captain after Virat Kohli to score a double century in England.","Akash Deep dismissed Ben Duckett for a duck with a length delivery outside off.

NEW DELHI: Shubman Gill etched his name in the history books by becoming the Indian Test captain with the highest individual score in the format. Gill’s magnificent 269 surpassed the previous record held by Virat Kohli , who had scored an unbeaten 254 not out against South Africa in Pune in 2019.Gill took charge of the Test side following Rohit Sharma’s retirement from red-ball cricket ahead of the ongoing five-match series against England. Coincidentally, Kohli too had announced his retirement from the format before the England tour, making Gill’s achievement even more symbolic as he stepped into a new leadership role with a record-breaking knock.In the process, Gill also went past batting icon Sachin Tendulkar ’s highest Test score. Tendulkar had remained unbeaten on 248 against Bangladesh in Dhaka in 2004.India have seen several iconic innings in Test cricket over the decades, with multiple players etching their names into the record books through remarkable knocks.The list of India’s highest individual Test scores is dominated by a few standout performers, none more so than Virender Sehwag, who features prominently for his explosive, record-shattering performances.At the top of the list is Sehwag’s 319 against South Africa in Chennai in 2008 — the highest-ever individual score by an Indian in Test cricket. It was an innings filled with audacious strokeplay, consuming just 304 balls at a staggering strike rate of 104.93. Sehwag didn’t just rewrite Indian records that day; he became only the third player in the world at the time to score two triple-centuries in Tests.His 309 against Pakistan at Multan in 2004, famously dubbed the ""Multan Sultan"" knock, was the first-ever triple ton by an Indian and announced his arrival as a game-changer in red-ball cricket.Joining Sehwag in the 300 club is Karun Nair, who stunned England with an unbeaten 303 in Chennai in 2016. This was only his third Test match, making it one of the most extraordinary breakthroughs in Indian cricket. His innings was instrumental in India posting a massive total and winning the Test by an innings.Another of Sehwag’s unforgettable innings came in 2009 against Sri Lanka at Brabourne Stadium, where he scored 293 off just 254 balls — narrowly missing out on a third triple-century. Few batters have combined aggression with consistency in Test cricket the way Sehwag did.The legendary VVS Laxman also features with his epic 281 against Australia at Eden Gardens in 2001 — widely regarded as one of the greatest innings in Test history. It was the cornerstone of a remarkable comeback win, turning the tide of the series and defining a new era in Indian cricket.Rahul Dravid’s 270 in Rawalpindi against Pakistan in 2004 was another masterclass in concentration and technique, while Virat Kohli’s unbeaten 254 against South Africa in 2019 remains his highest Test score. It was a commanding knock that highlighted his dominance as India’s modern-day batting pillar.Adding his name to this elite list is Gill who scored a brilliant 269.. It was not only his maiden double century but also made him the youngest Indian captain to reach the milestone. His innings, filled with 30 fours and 3 sixes, came against a quality attack and established him firmly as a future torchbearer of Indian batting.","Shubman Gill becomes the Indian Test captain with the highest individual score in the format.

EXCLUSIVE | David Gower on Shubman Gill, Jasprit Bumrah and India's England tour

In a historic first, India have registered two century partnerships for the sixth and seventh wickets in SENA countries in the ongoing second Test against England at Edgbaston.This is just the second time that a visiting team has had two century stands for the sixth wicket or lower in a Test innings in England, after West Indies at Trent Bridge in 1957. It’s the second such instance for India in an away Test after Kingston in 1971.In both partnerships, captain Shubman Gill stood tall and was equally well supported by Ravindra Jadeja and Washington Sundar On the opening day, when Ravindra Jadeja walked out to bat, India were in a spot of bother with the scorecard reading 211/5.Jadeja and Gill forged a 203-run stand for the sixth wicket.Jadeja was undone by a sharp bouncer bowled by Joshua Tongue. He missed a well-deserved century. If he had got those 11 runs, it would have been his second century at this venue.Next in, Washington Sundar stitched another valuable 144-run stand with captain Shubman Gill for the seventh wicket. Washington Sundar was cleaned up by Joe Root.India captain Shubman Gill scored a superb maiden Test double-century as he again led from the front against England in the second Test at Edgbaston on Thursday.Gill continued to take a toll on England's attack as he once more batted in near-flawless fashion.He was especially severe on Shoaib Bashir, cover-driving the off-spinner for four and lofting him for six.Gill also struck two fours in three balls off fast bowler Josh Tongue, an on-drive followed by a flick off the hip that saw Joe Root and Zak Crawley almost collide in a failed attempt to prevent the boundary.A hooked single off Tongue took Gill to 200 in 311 balls, including 21 fours and two sixes, with India then 472-6 as the elated skipper bowed to a capacity crowd in celebration.It was not long before the 25-year-old Gill, in just his second Test as captain, set a new record for the highest score by an India batsman in a Test in England, surpassing the great Sunil Gavaskar's 221 at The Oval back in 1979.","India have registered two century partnerships for the sixth and seventh wickets in SENA countries in the ongoing second Test against England at Edgbaston.

Former Liverpool manager Jürgen Klopp expressed deep sorrow over the tragic death of Diogo Jota and his younger brother André, who were killed in a car accident on Thursday. Jota, 28, and André died after their car veered off a motorway in northern Spain and burst into flames.Klopp, now serving as Red Bull's ""head of global soccer,"" had been instrumental in bringing Jota to Liverpool in 2020, convincing the club's board to sanction a £45 million ($62 million) transfer from Wolverhampton Wanderers after being impressed by the Portuguese forward’s performances.In an emotional post on Instagram, Klopp shared his grief:""This is a moment where I struggle!"" he wrote.""There must be a bigger purpose! But I can't see it! I'm heartbroken to hear about the passing of Diogo and his brother Andre.""Diogo was not only a fantastic player, but also a great friend, a loving and caring husband and father!""We will miss you so much! All my prayers, thoughts and power to Rute, the kids, the family, the friends and everyone who loved them! Rest in peace -- Love.""During Jota’s early days at Liverpool, Klopp had described him as an “exceptional player, exceptional boy,” underlining the strong bond they shared.Jota made an immediate impact after joining the Reds, becoming the first player in Liverpool’s history to score in each of his first four home games. He played a crucial role in the club’s 2021/22 campaign, helping them win the League Cup and FA Cup, and coming agonizingly close to a historic quadruple — narrowly missing out on the Premier League and Champions League titles.",Diogo Jota and his brother André died after their car veered off a motorway in northern Spain.

Former Wales and Real Madrid star Gareth Bale is reportedly preparing a dramatic return to football, but not on the pitch, raher, in the boardroom. The 35-year-old, who retired in 2023, is leading a consortium bidding to purchase Cardiff City, the club based in his hometown.Bale has submitted an offer exceeding €46 million to acquire the Welsh side, a move that would see him pay less than half of the €99 million Real Madrid shelled out for his services back in 2013. The former Galáctico said, “We’re interested in Cardiff. It’s my hometown club, where I grew up, and my uncle (Chris Pike) played for them,” as quoted byCardiff City, recently relegated to League One, is currently owned by Malaysian businessman Vincent Tan, who is reportedly open to selling. The club has already rejected an undisclosed initial offer from Bale’s consortium, but talks are expected to continue.Earlier reports stated that Bale’s group had explored acquiring other clubs, including a failed attempt to buy Plymouth Argyle. However, his interest in Cardiff appears deeply personal and long-term.“Being part of an ownership group would be a dream come true,” Bale said. “I’d love to be part of Cardiff’s growth and take it to the Premier League, where it deserves to be.”If successful, Bale would join a growing list of footballers turning owners, following the likes of David Beckham and Gerard Piqué, as he aims to drive Cardiff’s resurgence from League One back to the top flight.",Gareth Bale is leading a consortium bidding to purchase Cardiff City.

With four wins and three additional podiums in 12 rounds, Rowland leads this year’s Driver Standings by a massive margin. As the season nears its conclusion with the Berlin double-header and the London double-header remaining, the Nissan driver is almost certain to lift the championship trophy.Things began to look up for Oliver Rowland after he decided to switch from Mahindra Racing to Nissan last year. This season, he is all set to lift the Formula E World Championship trophy. Although he had a lackluster start in Sao Paulo, he bounced back with his first win of the year in Mexico. Soon after, he secured two podiums in Jeddah, including a win. He continued his strong form with double podiums in both the Monaco and Tokyo double-headers.After his last win in Tokyo, he brought his four-year-old daughter, Harper, to join him on the podium. Reflecting on the special moment after the Tokyo race, he said, ""I was already tired after qualifying. I was feeling pretty stressed with everything. There was a lot of pressure to go through.I was looking forward to the race being over, to be honest, and when it was over... when I saw her face, I just couldn't help but be super emotional. ”""[The atmosphere] was amazing. I didn't realise how many people were here until I stood on the podium, so it was a really special moment for me and the team.

He finished 10th in the most recent Round 12 race in Jakarta.The 32-year-old now inches closer to the championship at the Berlin E-Prix.

What sets the Berlin E-Prix apart

What’s challenging about the Tempelhof Circuit?

Past Berlin E-Prix winners

Season 11 of Formula E is now nearing its close, with four races remaining across two venues. Next up is the Berlin E-Prix, scheduled from July 11–13. Berlin is the only venue to have hosted a Formula E race every season since the championship's inception, making it one of the most special events on the calendar for multiple reasons. It has been held annually without a miss since 2015, and its scenic venue — the historic Tempelhof Airport — adds to its charm. Here are some interesting facts about Rounds 15 and 16 of the Formula E season in Berlin.One look at the Tempelhof circuit explains why the Berlin E-Prix is so special. With imposing aircrafts parked on one side of the barrier and a vast expanse of open space on the other, it’s arguably one of the most picturesque tracks in motorsport.Formula E cars are second only to airplanes when it comes to reaching top speeds — hitting 322 km/h in less than a minute. The most distinctive aspect of the Tempelhof Airport circuit is that it was originally designed for airplanes to take off and land, making it a unique surface for electric racing.The surface of the 2.343 km-long Tempelhof circuit is composed of layered concrete slabs designed for aircraft operations.While it supports Formula E racing, it presents challenges in energy management, tyre wear, and grip. The hot summer temperatures in Berlin can further test the drivers. Despite that, the wide layout, long corners, and even an indoor tunnel make the track exciting and full of overtaking opportunities.The Berlin E-Prix is a home race for DS Penske driver Maximilian Gunther. He won the event in 2020 and secured a third-place finish in 2023. The German driver recently expressed his excitement on Instagram. Reflecting on the Jakarta race, Gunther wrote, “Didn’t go our way this Saturday in Jakarta. Thanks for all the love, Indonesia. Now all eyes on Berlin – my home race.”However, it is TAG Heuer Porsche’s Antonio Felix da Costa who holds the record for the most Berlin E-Prix wins, having triumphed three times — twice in 2020 and once in 2024. Envision Racing’s Sebastien Buemi, Lola Yamaha ABT’s Lucas di Grassi, and TCS Jaguar Racing’s Nick Cassidy have each won the race twice.Also Read: Season 11 Berlin Rookie Test: Formula E teams announce nominations, eligibility rules explained However, this year’s race may see a new winner, as has been the case in several recent Formula E rounds.

Most wonderful shots from Jakarta E-Prix

It was a dusty yet thrilling Formula E race in Jakarta, with the championship returning to Indonesia after two years. Formula E has now shared some of the best videos from the Jakarta E-Prix for fans to relive the Indonesian race again and again. The real footage appears as eye-catching as scenes from a racing movie — complete with synchronized reactions from the audience and ground staff.The shots from the Jakarta E-Prix were shared by Formula E on Instagram with the caption: “Our race in Jakarta would have made a beautiful movie.” The first video is a still camera shot from a turn on the circuit, as the GEN3 Evo cars speed down the track. It is followed by a clip of a Lola Yamaha ABT driver getting into the car ahead of the race. There are also a few shots of the audience and ground staff moving their eyes from one direction to another as the cars race past.The post also includes a glimpse of Cupra Kiro driver Dan Ticktum celebrating his win by standing on his car amid loud cheers from his team members. There are additional shots from different corners of the circuit, each offering a unique visual experience. One clip features Jake Dennis, who, despite securing pole position, was hit by Nyck De Vries during the race — ruining his chances of winning or finishing on the podium.A comment from Mahindra Racing’s Instagram page read: “If Wes Anderson directed FE.” A fan agreed, saying, “Accidentally, the dust and pollution in Jakarta matched with Wes Anderson’s color palette.”One fan reacted to the post, “Love the still camera angle.” Another said, “Ha, it certainly would.” One more wrote, “Straight out of a movie scene!” Another comment read: “I hope this event will still be held in Jakarta next year.

Formula E drivers with the most front row starts

Does pole position — or a front row start — guarantee a win? Well, in most cases, it does. If not, it at least enables the driver to finish the race on the podium or earn some points to add to their score in the Driver Standings. This season, it’s Nissan’s Oliver Rowland who has clinched five front row starts and is leading the 2025 Formula E Driver Standings. He is far ahead of the competition and is almost certain to have secured the ABB FIA Formula E World Championship title this year.Oliver Rowland is far ahead of the competition at the top of the Formula E Driver Standings with 172 points. He has taken pole twice and started on the front row in three other races this year.There is hardly any scenario in which anyone can beat him in the remaining four races — except one. If Pascal Wehrlein, who is second in the Driver Standings, wins and Rowland fails to score any points, then only can Rowland’s top spot be challenged. However, that is highly unlikely, and Rowland will most probably lift the world championship trophy in London with ease.TAG Heuer Porsche driver Pascal Wehrlein has three front row starts, including two poles.This suggests that front row starts do play a major role in a driver’s chances of a podium finish.Pascal, however, is behind Taylor Barnard, who has delivered the most impressive performance on track this year. The NEOM McLaren driver recorded four front row starts, including two poles this season. He already has four podium finishes in what can be considered his first year as a full-time Formula E driver.Meanwhile, DS Penske driver Maximilian Gunther, TAG Heuer Porsche’s Antonio Felix da Costa, and Andretti’s Jake Dennis have two front row starts each this season. Among others who have grabbed pole position are Nissan’s Norman Nato, Mahindra Racing’s Nyck de Vries, Cupra Kiro’s Dan Ticktum, and Jaguar TCS Racing’s Nick Cassidy.Also Read: Oliver Rowland’s daughter Harper turns four, Nissan driver shares glimpse of her birthday celebrations There are four more races to go before the current Formula E season comes to an end.

Watch: Extrication practice in Formula E

Every motorsport involves risk, where a single crash can prove life-threatening. Formula E has maintained a strong safety record over its eleven seasons so far. However, as a precautionary measure, Formula E drivers undergo extrication practice once a year to ensure they are familiar with the emergency protocols in case of an incident. Recently, NEOM McLaren driver Sam Bird participated in one such practice session. A glimpse of the session was shared with fans on social media, offering insight into this important aspect of motorsport safety.The video shows Sam Bird acting as an injured driver while the FIA Formula E safety team carefully lifts him out of the car and places him on a stretcher. The procedure is designed to avoid further injury, particularly to the neck or any broken bones.McLaren FE shared the video on Instagram with the caption: “Earlier today, Sam completed his extrication practice with the @fiaformulae safety team. This is an exercise that happens at each race with a different team each time. This is for both the safety of the drivers and the extrication team should an incident occur where the driver would need assistance exiting the car. Each driver has to do this at least once a year to ensure their own safety.Some fans were momentarily alarmed upon seeing the video. One commented, “Goodness grief — not me watching the first few seconds of this without context.” Another said, “That scared me there for a second.”In general, fans appreciated the behind-the-scenes look at Formula E's extrication protocol. “Never seen the neck wrap/support before, very neat,” wrote one. Another added, “Much love to the safety teams, always prepared and always do an incredible job.” A third said, “Awesome to see, safety above all.” One fan even joked, “An FIA-mandated nap sounds quite nice.”Also Read: Who is Sam Bird’s girlfriend Jess Impiazzi?

Stoffel Vandoorne’s long-awaited win in Tokyo

Formula E Season 11 nears its finale



Stoffel Vandoorne has opened up about his crash into the barrier at the Jakarta E-Prix.

The disappointing weekend in Jakarta came just weeks after his long-awaited win in Tokyo — his first victory of the season.Taking to Instagram, Vandoorne shared a video of the crash along with a few snapshots from Jakarta, including a selfie with a fan. Explaining what went wrong, he wrote, “Not the best ending to my race in Jakarta. Lost regen and rear brakes with a few laps to go and ended up hitting the wall pretty hard. Looking forward to a little break now and reset for Berlin.”Despite the setback, fans flooded the comments with messages of support. TAG Heuer Porsche driver Antonio Felix Da Costa responded, “Glad you’re ok brother. Scary stuff.” Nissan’s Oliver Rowland — the current Formula E championship leader — also liked the post.One fan wrote, “Neveeerrrr give up Stoff! Good luck for next race and see you next time.” Another added, “Keep pushing, Stoff! Onwards and upwards.”A third commented, “Stay strong Stoff, better results are just around the corner.”Despite the Jakarta crash, Vandoorne’s season saw a major highlight when he took victory in Round 8 at the Tokyo E-Prix — his first win in three years, the last coming in Monaco in 2022. He currently sits 13th in the 2025 Formula E Driver Standings with 50 points.Prior to Jakarta, Vandoorne also competed in the 24 Hours of Le Mans in France, although the race didn’t yield the results his team had hoped for.Also Read: All about Stoffel Vandoorne - the Tokyo E-Prix Round 8 winner Teams now head to Berlin for a crucial double-header on July 12 and 13, marking Rounds 13 and 14 of the Formula E World Championship.

Training local marshals at Formula E circuits

Safety and technical knowledge are paramount in Formula E, where the sport involves handling some of the world’s fastest electric cars. Now, the FIA has given fans a behind-the-scenes look at how local marshals in each host country are trained before every Formula E race to ensure that operations run swiftly, efficiently, and to the highest standards.A video shared on the FIA Official Instagram page features Benoit Dupont, Head of Circuit Operations at FIA Formula E, offering a glimpse into the marshal training process at the Jakarta E-Prix.Speaking about the preparation in Jakarta this year, Dupont explains, “Before each Formula E race, we make sure that marshals are trained to the correct level to understand how to efficiently remove and recover a car. It's very important to have precise and fast operations. We've been in Indonesia before, but it was two years ago, so the goal here is to bring everyone back up to speed.”He adds that Formula E cars require a specific method of being lifted, particularly using a strap in a defined way. As a result, every post is trained individually to ensure marshals are fully up to date.Dupont also highlights the crucial role of the clerk of the course, who acts as a bridge between FIA officials and local marshals.He says, “Leaving a legacy is an important part of what the FIA brings to these races. There are international procedures that might not be followed at local races, so we ensure they meet the latest standards. That’s why we conduct training sessions like this,” he says. “The clerk of the course connects with the marshals, all the trackside personnel, and the recovery team. Since they communicate in their local language, the clerk ensures the communication line remains as efficient as possible.”Commenting on the video, one Formula E fan wrote, “Well done on showcasing these wonderful men and women who keep races going and clear up the mess after an OOPS moment from the drivers.”Also Read: Dan Ticktum shares unfiltered pictures and a note after Jakarta win, mentions losing F1 chance: “It wasn’t down to my attitude” The Jakarta E-Prix was a single-header this year, unlike its double-header format in the 2023 season. With just four more races remaining, the 2024–25 Formula E season is nearing its conclusion. Next up is the Berlin double-header on July 11–12, followed by the season finale in London on July 26–27.","FIA gives fans a behind-the-scenes look at how local marshals in each host country are trained before every Formula E race.

Jeff Dodds on Formula E’s popularity



Formula E has witnessed a steep rise in audience growth across television and social media during the first half of the 2024–25 season, with projections suggesting the sport could surpass 500 million viewers by the end of Season 11. While the Mexico E-Prix was the most-watched race in the US, the Jeddah double-header set a new benchmark as the most-watched Formula E weekend in history.According to the latest figures from Kantar Media, a record-breaking cumulative audience of 44 million tuned in to watch the Mexico E-Prix — Round 2 of the season held in January. It became the most-watched Formula E race in the US, with CBS coverage of the event reaching 11 million viewers.The Jeddah double-header (Rounds 3 and 4) drew 65 million global cumulative viewers, setting a new all-time high for a Formula E weekend. Meanwhile, the Monaco E-Prix (Round 8) delivered a 25 percent increase in viewership compared to the same race in Season 10. The Tokyo E-Prix (Round 9) also broke records in Japan, registering the highest-ever Formula E TV audience in the country — a 20 percent rise over Season 10’s numbers on Fuji TV.Digital audiences have also shown notable growth. Data from Emplifi revealed a 13 percent increase in social video views and a 12 percent rise in engagement, underscoring the vibrant and interactive fan community that continues to grow around the sport.Commenting on the surge in popularity, Formula E CEO Jeff Dodds said, “The latest figures from our external providers are truly phenomenal and show the tremendous momentum behind the growth of our sport. They highlight that not only do we have world-leading technology and acceleration in the cars, but that it’s producing some of the best, most competitive racing that both old and new fans can’t get enough of.”“We’re building fan bases and loyalty in key and emerging markets, with Mexico and the US as prime examples of how our investment and long-term presence are paying off. As the world’s fastest-growing motorsport, we know we can’t stand still. We must continue delivering the best racing, the best rivalries, and the most inclusive events to maintain our steep growth trajectory and strengthen our community of electric super fans,” he added.Also Read: Dan Ticktum shares unfiltered pictures and a note after Jakarta win, mentions losing F1 chance: “It wasn’t down to my attitude” The current season of the ABB FIA Formula E World Championship began in Sao Paulo in December 2024 and will conclude in London at the end of July 2025.

Great Britain's Oliver Tarvet, ranked 733rd in the world, faced World No. 2 Carlos Alcaraz in the second round at Wimbledon 2025, losing 6-1, 6-4, 6-4 on Wednesday while declaring it the most special day of his life despite having no immediate plans to turn professional.Tarvet, playing in only his second main draw Grand Slam match, put up a spirited performance against the five-time Grand Slam champion on Centre Court.The 21-year-old US college student managed to challenge Alcaraz, who remains on course for his third consecutive Wimbledon title.""It's not every day that you get to play against maybe the best player in the world. I did a pretty good job of kind of enjoying the moment and trying to also play some good tennis at the same time,"" Tarvet said.""I woke up a couple times in the night from the adrenaline. In the car, my heart rate was going quicker than it usually does. Obviously there were nerves. I kind of knew that the first set might be difficult because it's not a stage that I'm used to. I still had break points in three games. I definitely had chances.""Tarvet had eight unconverted break points in the first set before successfully breaking early in the second set, celebrating with a finger waggle to the delighted crowd.Alcaraz immediately broke back, demonstrating the gap between their skill levels.""Credit to him, he plays the big points just incredibly well. That's the difference. You kind of feel like you're in the set, you lose it 6-1, it's tough. But even though it was not the result that I wanted today, it was definitely the most special day of my life,"" Tarvet said.Despite earning £99,000 (Rs 1.15 crore) for reaching the second round, Tarvet cannot collect much of it due to amateur rules as a US college student in San Diego. He joked he would travel on a private jet back to the US.""No, I mean, nothing has changed based on the last 10 days. I still want to go back to the University of San Diego. I have a lot of personal goals that I still haven't achieved as a team at USD. As much as I have professional goals, college has been such a big part of my career, part of my life. There's definitely some things that I want to achieve before I go full-time.""Reflecting on his tournament experience, Tarvet shared his insights.""Most about myself is just how powerful the mind is. I feel statistically or on paper, I wasn't supposed to win some of the matches that I won, but I backed myself against those guys. I just realised there's a lot of power in kind of having that confidence in yourself.""Alcaraz, currently on a 20-match winning streak after victories in Rome, French Open, and Queen's Club, praised his opponent's performance.""I told him just congratulations for the run, keep it going, keep working hard. It seems like he's a really nice guy and a really nice, hard worker. It seems like he loves tennis. He played with such a good passion out there, that is really important. If he keeps practising hard and playing in a professional level, I think he can go far.""","Oliver Tarvet, ranked 733rd in the world, faced World No. 2 Carlos Alcaraz in the second round at Wimbledon.

LONDON: Whatever is said of World No.1 Aryna Sabalenka’s volatile temper, that has seen her come undone in the closing stages of championships, she’s as clean as a whistle in early rounds of majors. On a cloudy afternoon at Wimbledon , when the start of play was delayed on the outside courts, Sabalenka provided the sunshine, thumping 41 winners and breaking down the resistance of Czech Marie Bouzkova to score a 7-6 (4), 6-4 win to move into the third round.Of the last six Grand Slams that the 27-year-old Belarusian has played, she has made the final five times. She has lost three of those finals, two of them the result of meltdowns which became the talking point. Not enough is said, however, of her professionalism in the early stages of majors. She hasn’t lost in the first or second rounds since 2021.This year her Tour record against opponents ranked outside the top-20 is 29-4. “I’m just trying to focus on myself mainly. I know that when I’m focusing on myself, I’ll be there fighting for every point,” the top-seed said.The reason why Sabalenka took to tennis was her father Sergey, who she lost suddenly in November 2019.For most of 2020 she struggled with the loss, but broke through to Grand Slam semifinals in 2021 — at Wimbledon and the US Open. Sabalenka’s game is a beast, she’s easily the hardest ball striker in the women’s Tour today, and maybe the hardest hitter ever, but in recent years she has worked to bring other elements to her game.Defending champion Carlos Alcaraz put out British qualifier Oliver Tarvet 6-1, 6-4, 6-4 in the second round. Tarvet, who plays college tennis for the University of San Diego, made his major debut here. Meanwhile, Joao Fonseca extended his debut run at Wimbledon, holding off American Jenson Brooksby 6-4, 5-7, 6-2, 6-4 to make the third round.","Aryna Sabalenka beats Marie Bouzkova 7-6 (4), 6-4 at Wimbledon.

Poll Do you believe professional athletes face unique mental health challenges? Yes, definitely No, it's the same as any job Maybe, it depends on the individual Not sure

EXCLUSIVE | David Gower on Shubman Gill, Jasprit Bumrah and India's England tour

This isn’t about the timing of forehands and backhands, rest assured Alexander Zverev is feeling the ball quite well. This is about a sunless space; where the joy is fading.The world No. 3, who went down in five sets to Frenchman Arthur Rinderknech in the Wimbledon first round on Tuesday, has said for the first time in his life that he is considering therapy.The 28-year-old German, one of the heavyweights of a generation that was tipped to take over from tennis’ trinity — Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic — is an Olympic gold medallist, and twice champion of the ATP’s season finale, but is yet to win a Major. He has made three Grand Slam finals, most recently at Melbourne Park in January, where he was outplayed by the world No. 1 Jannik Sinner.“Generally speaking, I feel quite alone in life,” said Zverev, who is dating Sophia Thomalla, a 35-year-old actress, model, and television presenter.Zverev is of the belief that something within him has to change, and he’s hoping that it will happen by the time he arrives in Toronto for the American hardcourt swing in late July.The German, diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes as a four-year-old, has anger management issues, having launched an intimidating attack on an umpire’s chair, following a doubles loss in Acapulco three years ago.Zverev has also been accused of violence by his former girlfriend Olga Sharypova in 2020 and of domestic abuse in 2023 by Brenda Patea, with whom he has a child.Zverev has categorically denied both sets of allegations. A Berlin court case filed by Patea was discontinued last year. “I’ve been through a lot of difficulties in the media. I’ve been through a lot of difficulties in life generally,” he said. “I’ve never felt this empty before, just lacking joy in everything that I do. It’s a feeling that you’re going to bed and you’re just not really motivated for the next day, you don’t really feel like waking up and going to work,” he said. “I think everybody has had this feeling, it doesn’t matter what job you had. For an athlete, it reflects on performance a lot.”Zverev was speaking for a community late on Tuesday. In recent times there has been a profusion of cases, with players bringing to light the challenges of life on the tour. World No. 2 Coco Gauff, who claimed her second Grand Slam title at Roland Garros in June, was bounced out of the Wimbledon first round late on Tuesday, failing to Dayana Yastremska in straight sets.“I feel like mentally I was a little bit overwhelmed with everything that came afterwards,” the 21-year-old American said of the days following her triumph. “I didn’t feel like I had enough time to celebrate and also get back. The turnaround was quick.”After limping out of Roland Garros in late May, Casper Ruud, the two-time French Open finalist, called the ATP Rankings a ‘rat race’. “You feel obligated to play, you feel like you lose a lot if you don’t show up and play, economically, points-wise, ranking-wise and opportunity-wise,” said Ruud.Spirited Aussie Alex de Minaur, who complained of being burnt out in just the fifth month of the season, called for a shorter schedule.After crashing out in the first round to Arthur Fery, a British player ranked No. 461, Alexei Popyrin told reporters that he felt “numb” and “unmotivated”.“I was underprepared going into Wimbledon, that’s something you know can’t happen again,” the 25-year-old Aussie said. “I’m not upset because of today. I’m upset because of everything that’s happened before. I have to prioritise mental health.”While Zverev’s struggles are different, it’s about striking a balance between tennis and life.","Alexander Zverev says he is considering therapy for the first time in his life.

On Day 3 at Wimbledon , Carlos Alcaraz ended Oliver Tarvet’s dream run by defeating the British amateur in straight sets, advancing to the third round.Defending champion Alcaraz took just two hours and 17 minutes to overcome World No. 733 Tarvet, who showcased glimpses of his rising talent and thrilled the passionate crowd with flashes of brilliance.Alcaraz has now won 20 matches in a row, a streak that includes titles at the Rome Masters, the French Open, and Queen’s Club.He aims to become only the fifth man in the Open Era to secure at least three consecutive Wimbledon titles, joining Bjorn Borg, Pete Sampras, Roger Federer, and seven-time champion Novak Djokovic.Over on the women's side, Aryna Sabalenka bucked the trend of early shockers, defeating 48th-ranked Marie Bouzkova 7-6 (7/4), 6-4 in a fiercely contested, hard-hitting match.The Belarusian, who faced tough losses in both the Australian Open and French Open finals this year, impressed with 41 winners during the 95-minute encounter.“Honestly, it’s really sad to see so many top players losing, but you’ve got to focus on your own game,” said the three-time Grand Slam champion. “I hope there won’t be any more upsets in this tournament, if you know what I mean!”Even before Day 3 of this year's Wimbledon began, 23 of 46 seeds had exited the tournament.By the time the curfew was imposed, another eight were headed for the exit door. But none bigger than fourth seed Jasmine Paolini.Paolini, beaten by Barbora Krejcikova in last year's Wimbledon final, suffered a 4-6, 6-4, 6-4 defeat against Russian world number 62 Kamilla Rakhimova on Court 3.12th seed Frances Tiafoe was the latest leading men's singles player to suffer the agony of an early defeat, going down 4-6, 6-4, 6-3, 7-5 against British world number 61 Cameron Norrie.Britain's Emma Raducanu played some of her best tennis since her 2021 US Open victory, convincingly defeating 2023 Wimbledon champion Marketa Vondrousova 6-3, 6-3 to advance to the third round.Playing in front of a lively Centre Court crowd, Raducanu was left surprised by her own level as she outplayed the Czech.“That was one of the best matches I’ve played in a long time,” Raducanu said. “I turned around a point that I think is probably the best point I’ve ever played, so that was pretty crazy. I think the crowd was really into it.”However, she may need to elevate her game even further in her next encounter. With four of the five top women's seeds already knocked out, Raducanu’s next opponent will be the only remaining top seed — No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka.“Yeah, I guess there’s no pressure at all on me in the next round,” Raducanu said with a laugh during the on-court interview.British tennis players had already created history at Wimbledon 2025. A record number had entered the main draw, a record number progressed from the first round and the hunt for the next Andy Murray continued with a record number of men making it into the Round of 64.Seven men including fourth seed Jack Draper, Dan Evans, Jack Pinnington Jones and amateur Oliver Tarvet all made it into this year's second round at Wimbledon -- Britain's best tally at any Slam since 1997.Andy Murray had ended Britain's wait for a men's Wimbledon champion in 2013 - a wait that had gone on for 77 years or since Fred Perry's title in 1936. The next wait could be shorter thanks to Draper.The 23-year-old has been keen to keep expectations low although he says British tennis is currently ""in a good spot"", partly due to Murray's influence.""Andy has had a huge effect on a lot of the younger generation, watching his success over the years, major success on the big stage.""It's really exciting what we're going to have in the next 10 years.... It's cool to be a part of that,"" said the winner of Indian Wells Masters 1000 title this week.Draper's next round at Wimbledon is against former Wimbledon finalist and 2014 US Open winner Marin Cilic.Priyanka Chopra and husband Nick Jonas, John Cena, Olivia Rodrigo and Dave Grohl were some of the big names in the Wimbledon Royal Box on Wednesday.“It's so special in the Royal Box to have those kind of people in there. It definitely adds a bit of pressure, I guess, if you look up and you kind of recognize (them),” Raducanu said. “That’s why I try and stay with my eyes on the court as much as possible. Only after, you kind of look up and take it all in, if they’re still there.”The Royal Box seats are by invitation only, and there was quite a list of celebrities on hand for Day 3.“I was trying not to look today,” Sabalenka said about the boldfaced names, explaining that she might be distracted while competing. “I was just trying to focus on my game. Later on, I’m going to open the social media (and ask), ‘OK, who was there?’”","Carlos Alcaraz ended Oliver Tarvet’s dream run by defeating the British amateur in straight sets, advancing to the third round. Aryna Sabalenka defeated 48th- ranked Marie Bouzkova 7-6 (7/4), 6-4 in a fiercely contested, hard-hitting match.

Carlos Alcaraz marched into the third round of Wimbledon on Wednesday with a commanding straight-sets win over British wildcard Oliver Tarvet, as chaos reigned elsewhere in the draw with more seeded stars tumbling out.The defending champion and world No. 3 took just two hours and 17 minutes to defeat the 21-year-old amateur 6-1, 6-4, 6-4, showing his class while still acknowledging the home favourite’s spirited performance.“Big praise to Oliver,” said Alcaraz. “In just his second match on the tour, I loved his game to be honest. I knew I had to play my best tennis today.”Alcaraz, who has now won 20 consecutive matches including titles at Roland Garros, Queen’s Club, and Rome, is seeking to become the fifth man in the Open era to win three straight Wimbledon crowns — a feat achieved only by Borg, Sampras, Federer, and Djokovic.Tarvet, ranked No. 733, made headlines with his first-round win but must forgo most of his earnings to maintain amateur status as a student-athlete. Reflecting on his Centre Court debut, he said: “It was really special. It’s not every day you get to play maybe the best player in the world. I just tried to enjoy it.”While Alcaraz thrived, women’s fourth seed Jasmine Paolini became the latest high-profile casualty. The 2023 finalist fell 4-6, 6-4, 6-4 to Russian world No.62 Kamilla Rakhimova, joining the likes of Gauff, Pegula, and Zheng in a shocking early exodus.“It’s tough out there. Everyone plays well at this level,” Paolini admitted. “But I didn’t take my chances today.”The mass exodus of top seeds — now eight from the men’s and women’s top 10 combined — set a Grand Slam Open era record for most early-round exits.Aryna Sabalenka, however, stood firm. The world No. 1 saw off Marie Bouzkova 7-6 (7/4), 6-4, hammering 41 winners and setting up a blockbuster clash with Britain’s Emma Raducanu, who stunned 2023 champion Marketa Vondrousova 6-3, 6-3.“Honestly, it’s sad to see so many top players go out,” Sabalenka said. “But you better focus on yourself. I hope there are no more upsets — if you know what I mean!”In the men’s draw, Frances Tiafoe (12th seed) lost to Cameron Norrie, while Taylor Fritz (5th seed) survived another five-set battle, edging Gabriel Diallo to avoid joining the long list of early exits.","Carlos Alcaraz beat British wildcard Oliver Tarvet in straight sets.

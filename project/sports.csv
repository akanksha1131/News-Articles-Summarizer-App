'A particularly special feeling': Andy Flower hails Virat Kohli, RCB after historic title win





NEW DELHI: At least 11 people were killed and over 40 were injured after a stampede broke out outside the Chinnaswamy Stadium in Bengaluru on Wednesday. Royal Challengers Bengaluru had planned their IPL 2025 victory celebrations but things got out of control shortly before the event was due to begin inside the stadium.Around 5pm, multiple reports of injuries and deaths emerged from outside the stadium but the programme continued as planned. It is understood that Indian Premier League (IPL) Governing Council Chairman Arun Dhumal had to call up the franchise, who were unaware of the events which unfolded outside the venue. Dhumal was assured that the event will be wrapped up quickly inside the stadium but the damage was already done outside it.Even after getting a call from the IPL chair, why wasn't the event wrapped up?RCB issued an official statement expressing grief over the tragic incident.""We are deeply anguished by the unfortunate incidents that have come to light through media reports regarding public gatherings all over Bengaluru in anticipation of the team’s arrival this afternoon. The safety and well-being of everyone is of utmost importance to us.RCB mourns the tragic loss of lives and extend our heartfelt condolences to the affected families.Immediately upon being made aware of the situation, we promptly amended our program, and followed, the guidance and advice of the local administration.We urge all our supporters to please stay safe.""In what was a clear case of poor planning, a lot of innocent lives were lost and panic gripped the city which was in the mood to celebrate RCB's maiden IPL title. TimesofIndia.com has reliably learnt that the event management company DNA was only asked to ensure the sound and stage arrangements inside the stadium.Clearly there was a lack of preparedness and a sudden influx of people overwhelmed the security personnel stationed outside the cricket ground. Additionally, there was a lot of confusion regarding the team's open bus parade with the IPL title and the situation could have gotten much worse had it happened.Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) Secretary Davajit Saikia termed the incident ""unfortunate"" and felt the organisers should have done better.""It is very unfortunate. This is a negative side of popularity. People are crazy for their cricketers. The organisers should have planned it better. My deepest condolences to the family of the deceased. I wish early recovery of the injured,"" said Saikia in an interaction with PTI.""When one organises a victory celebration of this magnitude, proper precautions, safety and security measures need to be taken. There have been some lapses somewhere. After such a glorious ending to the IPL, this has been an anti climax. There have been IPL celebrations in the past as well, like in Kolkata last year when KKR won but nothing happened there,"" he added.There have been plenty of celebrations in the country in the past but did the authorities not get adequate time to be prepared for an event of this magnitude?Could there have been a better way to go about this?Who exactly is at fault?

The Texas Super Kings (TSK) are one of the most popular teams in Major League Cricket (MLC) due to the presence of some of the best in the business and connect with the Chennai Super Kings (CSK). TSK have developed a solid reputation of being a side which fights till the end, making life as difficult as possible for the opposition.However, the Texas-based franchise is yet to win the tournament so far, which will certainly be a source of concern for fans. The upcoming third edition of the MLC may well bring an end to this barren run. Interestingly, CSK had also won the IPL for the first time in their third season of the tournament, going on to dominate the league in the coming years.The Texas-based franchise delivered an impressive performance in their maiden season, pulling off a dominant win by 69 runs in their maiden MLC match. The Super Kings finished on the second position in the points table following three wins in five matches. However, a bad day on the field in the second qualifier against MI New York resulted in an unexpected exit, bringing an end to their surge for the trophy. Devon Conway was the top run-getter for the team, smashing 221 runs in seven matches at a strike rate of 126.29.David Miller was the second-highest run-getter, with 143 runs in seven games. Leg-spinner Mohammad Mohsin emerged as the leading wicket-taker, accounting for nine dismissals. Gerald Coetzee picked eight wickets.South African batter Faf du Plessis had a season to forget in the inaugural edition of the tournament, recording single digits in five out of seven innings. His overall run tally in MLC 2023 came down to just 46 runs. However, Du Plessis pulled off a stunning comeback in the next edition, leading from the front with quality performances. The South African finished as the season's top run-getter, smashing 420 runs. TSK showcased similar dominance to that in the first season, finishing third on the points table. They could have finished even higher if not for two abandoned matches.TSK came close to their maiden appearance in the final, after reaching the qualifier stage where they faced San Francisco Unicorns. While Du Plessis attempted his best to help the Texas-based franchise finish victorious, smashing 45 runs off 22 balls, a slim margin of 10 runs resulted in them being knocked out. Noor Ahmad and Marcus Stoinis were the top wicket-takers, accounting for nine dismissals each.Devon Conway is the leading run-getter for the Super Kings so far in the MLC, smashing 514 runs in 15 matches at a strike rate of 135.62 and an average of 42.83.

Tiding over testing times





: Tears of joy, relief and spent emotion flowed freely here as Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) finally shrugged off the Himalayan weight on their shoulders, one that had built steadily over 6,255 days. That’s how long it took RCB to win their maiden IPL trophy.When Rajat Patidar - anointed captain this season - lifted the elusive trophy after a clinical six-run win over Punjab Kings, it capped a journey of painstaking planning which began at the mega auction last year. It started on a drawing board in a backroom with Mo Bobat, director of cricket, and head coach Andy Flower , a former player-turned-coach with a reputation of building teams on individual potential and translating it into team success.Bobat and Flower began with only three retentions: Virat Kohli , Patidar and Yash Dayal. It didn’t inspire a lot of confidence in their legion of loyal fans but the two appeared to have a ringside view of the future. They meticulously built a side to tackle all conditions. The focus was on ensuring a mixture of international experience and Indian expertise.The batting side of the equation was built around Kohli . He was allied with Phil Salt at the top of the order with Devdutt Padikkal, Patidar, Jitesh Sharma, Liam Livingstone, Tim David and Romario Shepherd among the support cast.Bowling was RCB’s Achilles heel over the years, but Bobat and Flower addressed that half by roping in a pace battery which included Josh Hazlewood, Bhuvneshwar Kumar and Lungi Ngidi besides Dayal. Interestingly, the spin department was handled by Krunal Pandya and Suyash Sharma.Once they had the team they wanted, the captaincy issue cropped up. Having let go of Faf du Plessis and with Kohli refusing the armband again, they turned to Patidar, who was being groomed for the job from the previous season.As a captain, Patidar was both inexperienced and understated, but nonetheless a man who knew the job. “I think one of the most impressive things about what Rajat’s done this year is, as an inexperienced captain, he hasn’t been affected by it,” said Flower. “I’ve watched him closely as a character. He is still the lovely, gentle, polite Rajat Patidar that we knew last year.”Regardless, the choice was met with disbelief and, perhaps, not a little disappointment from fans who expected Kohli to be back in the saddle. Flower admitted: “Captaining RCB is a really tricky job. I’ve got tremendous respect for how Rajat has held himself with all that scrutiny. And captaining some big players. You can’t underestimate the calmness that he showed in leading big players. I’m proud of the way he’s carried himself. ”There were early signs that Patidar’s team had the potential to be champions when they handed defending champions Kolkata Knight Riders a sevenwicket defeat in their den. In less than a week, they were in Chennai taming the Super Kings. The dream turned a shade grey with they lost to Gujarat Titans and Delhi Capitals at home, but in the intervening period they had ambushed Mumbai Indians at the Wankhede stadium.Yet, those were only initial signs. They went from strength to strength, winning five of their last seven league fixtures and losing only one. The other game was a washout. The wins came despite injuries to Patidar, Hazlewood and Salt’s illness, a remarkable testimony to the strength of their bench.Thereafter, there was no looking back, until the lights went out at the Modi stadium on Tuesday night. The spotlight now shines brightly on the newly-crowned champions.",Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) beat Punjab Kings (PBKS) by six runs in the 2025 IPL final.

: Victories are joyous but defeats can be sapping. Negative emotions after a big defeat can sometimes last months. Very often, the analysis centres around ifs and buts. However, Ricky Ponting, head coach of IPL runners-up Punjab Kings, chose to look at the larger perspective.“It was only a couple of days ago that we were here celebrating one of our great wins for the season to get into the final, and today we probably feel that we let one slip. But, with this group being as young as it is, we’ll be back bigger and stronger next season,” said Ponting. “I made it clear when I was appointed head coach that I wanted to make sure things were different. I wanted to make sure things were done in a certain way, and that’s from the top, from the owners to the head coach all the way down to the bus driver. ”The Kings had only retained Shashank Singh and Prabhsimran Singh going into the mega auction but built a squad that came within six runs of winning the IPL.“I wanted to make significant changes and I think we’ve managed to do that. If you ask the players, you ask any of the staff involved in this campaign, I think they’d say that it’s been a really enjoyable time. With only two retentions at the auction table, to be able to build a group like we have...all the scouts and all the management (was) involved,” the former Australia captain said.“Retaining Prabhsimran and Shashank allowed us to go in with a big budget. So I started at the top with the captain, Arshdeep and Chahal, and those guys. But to build a team, you’ve got to build around experienced players as well. So, once we locked those experienced players in the first part of the auction, then it was about picking the right young talent to make our franchise different and dynamic,” he added.About the match, Ponting said, “It was probably a little bit of inexperience that cost us.”",Punjab Kings lost the IPL final by just six runs to Royal Challengers Bengaluru.

: When PBKS batter Shashank Singh smote Josh Hazlewood’s last ball for a six, even their coach Ricky Ponting wasn’t sure of its impact. Because all eyes were instead on one team and one man in particular — RCB’s Virat Kohli The man who gave his “youth, prime and experience” to the Bengaluru franchise sank to his knees, with his face to the ground. It didn’t take long for his teammates to join him. And when Kohli finally looked up, a bagful of emotions writ large on his face, the RCB fandom heaved a sigh of relief.Kohli’s feelings were understandable. No one else in the team has seen as many heartbreaks as the former captain, who has played four finals and stuck with the franchise since 2008. Kohli took the first three seasons to warm up in the company of illustrious players like Rahul Dravid, Anil Kumble and Kevin Pietersen. Kohli grew with the franchise and its fandom. The 2011 season, when he scored 557 runs, marked a turnaround. It was only fitting, then, that apart from his current teammates, Kohli shared the spotlight with two men who shared his pain and disappointment — Chris Gayle and AB de Villiers lifted the trophy with him.Speaking to the official broadcaster, Kohli later said, “Sharing this moment with AB and Chris means everything to me. I spent my prime years playing alongside them.“We tried so hard, came so close, and had such an explosive team back then — but we could never cross the line. That hurt stays with you, because we gave everything to this franchise. This win feels 10 times more special because those two are standing next to me. It’s as much theirs as it is mine.”With the IPL trophy, Kohli may have ticked another box, but he was quick to underline the value of Test cricket, from which he recently retired. “This moment is right up there with the best moments I’ve had in my career. But it still marks five levels under Test cricket.That’s how much I value Test cricket. And that’s how much I love Test cricket. “I’d urge youngsters coming through to treat that format with respect, because if you perform in Test cricket, you walk around anywhere in the world, people look you in the eye and shake your hand and say, well done, you played the game really well. So, if you want to earn respect in world cricket, take up Test cricket, give your heart and soul to it. ”Kohli’s words were endorsed by Punjab Kings head coach Ricky Ponting, who said, “I understand that. I’m probably one of the biggest purists of the game that is still involved in the game. Whether I’m coaching or commentating, my first love is Test cricket.”- Stats by Rajesh Kumar","Virat Kohli is the only batter to score 1000-plus runs against fouropponents — PBKS, CSK,DC & KKR. 5 - Times Kohli has scored600- plus runs in an IPL season, a record. 973 - Kohli’s run aggregate at 49.88, including five hundreds& 36 fifties in 125 innings in winning causes. 71 - His scoresof 50-plus - 8hundreds & 63fifties — is the most inthe IPL.

PATHUM THANI (THAILAND): A lacklustre India lost 0-2 against Thailand in an international football friendly in a reality check ahead of their crucial Asian Cup qualifying round match on Wednesday.Benjamin Davis and Poramet Arjvilai scored for Thailand in the 8th and 59th minute respectively as the home side dominated the match at the Thammasat Stadium.India had won the last two matches between the two sides before Wednesday's defeat but Thailand, ranked 99th in the world, were clearly the better side on the day.India are currently ranked a lowly 127th.The talismanic Sunil Chhetri , who had scored twice in India's 4-1 win against Thailand in the 2019 AFC Asian Cup, nearly scored in the 24th minute but his glancing header was saved by a diving Thailand goalkeeper Saranon Anui.India had also beaten Thailand 1-0 in the Kings Cup in 2019.Thailand were technically bettered equipped and more clinical while India were left ruing missed opportunities and costly defensive lapses. The Indian midfield also lacked creativity.This was the Indian team's second defeat in seven matches under head coach Manolo Marquez, the last one being 0-3 loss to Syria in the Intercontinental Cup last year in Hyderabad.Out of the five remaining matches under his charge, four were drawn games while the lone win came against Maldives (3-0) in March in an international friendly.Thailand made their early dominance count. Phitiwat Sookjitthammakul found Korawich Tasa near the edge of the Indian box in the eighth minute. Tasa smartly laid it off for Ben Davis, who took a deft first touch to steady himself before unleashing a thunderous right-footed shot past Indian goalkeeper Vishal Kaith.It was Davis’ fourth goal in seven appearances for Thailand, and the Indian backline was left exposed, reacting too late to close him down.India gradually grew into the game, using the width of the pitch to stretch the Thailand defence. Liston Colaco, operating fluently between midfield and the left flank, was a standout performer, linking up well with Sunil Chhetri and forward Ashique Kuruniyan.India's first opportunity to level the score in the first half came in the 24th minute. Colaco delivered a teasing free-kick from the left which Chhetri met with a clever header, timing his run perfectly to get ahead of his marker. However, Thailand goalkeeper Saranon Anuin dived to his left to pull off a sharp save.Thailand continued to pose threat on the Indian citadel, with long-range efforts from Korawich Tasa and Arjvilai narrowly missing the target.The momentum began to shift slightly in India’s favour as the half wore on. Abhishek came close with a driven shot from distance that missed the horizontal by inches in the 40th minute.But the golden opportunity arrived in first-half stoppage time. Chhetri played a sublime through ball from midfield to find Colaco’s run, splitting the Thai defence. Colaco brought the ball under control but couldn’t finish the one-on-one chance as Anuin narrowed the angle to eventually thwart the danger with a timely save.In the 59th minute, a miss pass in the midfield gifted Thailand ball possession. The ball was quickly fed to Arjvilai on the left flank. Spotting Vishal Kaith slightly off his line after sidestepping Ashish Rai, Arjvilai curled a magnificent effort into the top-right corner to double Thailand’s lead and deflate Indian hopes.Substitute Lallianzuala Chhangte got a fine chance in the 80th minute but his left footer went just wide of the upright.The Changsuek, meanwhile, looked to exploit the spaces India left behind and could have added a third if not for a crucial intervention by Anwar Ali, who threw himself in front of a goal-bound shot in the dying moments.The match was part of preparation for India's crucial AFC Asian Cup qualifying round match against Hong Kong on June 10 in Kowloon.The same was also the case for Thailand as they face Turkmenistan in their AFC Asian Cup final round qualifier.",Benjamin Davis and Poramet Arjvilai scored for Thailand in the 8th and 59th minute respectively.

'A particularly special feeling': Andy Flower hails Virat Kohli, RCB after historic title win





PANAJI: Naushad Moosa has returned as head coach of the India under-23 squad. This time, he has been handed a longer rope, stretching a year, and tasked with preparing the team for next year’s Asian Games and the AFC U-23 Asian Cup, qualifiers for which will be held in September.Last year, Moosa, assistant to Juan Pedro at NorthEast United, was in charge of the under-23 team for two friendlies against Malaysia in Kuala Lumpur.“The longer contract helps me understand the players better,” Moosa told TOI in a recent interview. “I spoke with the AIFF and told them it’s important to have longer camps as well, so that we can properly assess the players and opponents. I want to bring the best out of these players. Getting them to gel together, though, will be a challenge.”Moosa, a former international who played for India between 1994 and 1998 and won the SAFF Championship in 1997, has named a 29-member probable squad for the two friendlies in Dushanbe against Tajikistan and Kyrgyz Republic, later this month. A concern for Moosa is that a majority of players are with ISL clubs. Many of them are without enough playing time in the top tier of Indian football.“The younger under-19 players, all of them want to play for ISL clubs. My advice is don’t jump (straightway) into the ISL. Of course, you should try, but only a few make it to the top. The youngsters can sign for clubs where they get to play. At this age, it’s important for them to be playing competitive matches. Sitting on the bench for financially-rich clubs doesn't really help in their growth as players,” said Moosa.“The younger players in the ISL are not getting enough opportunities. There are a lot of promising players in the I-League who we will track,” added Moosa.From amongst the 29 probables, only a handful have featured regularly for their teams in the ISL. Just one among them, Vibin Mohanan, has a senior team appearance, though Ayush Chhetri, Abhishek Singh and Suhail Bhat, all aged below 23, are currently under Manolo Marquez with the national team.Mohammed Sanan, Nikhil Barla (both Jamshedpur), Korou Singh, Bikash Yumnam (both Kerala Blasters), Macarton Louis Nickson, Parthib Gogoi (both NorthEast United) and Dipendu Biswas (Mohun Bagan) are the more recognisable names among the under-23 probables.Only two players -- Rahul Raju (Gokulam Kerala) and Mohammad Arbaz (Real Kashmir) – are doing duty in the I-League, the second tier tournament.“We need to have more camps, more exposure matches. If we cannot travel abroad, we can play here, but with stronger opponents. Losing is not a problem. It’s important we play stronger opponents to prepare for the challenges. Our aim should not be to win SAFF. We must look at the bigger stage where we will be properly judged,” said Moosa.India U-23 will face Tajikistan and Kyrgyz Republic in two friendlies on June 18 and June 21 as part of the AIFF’s long-term plans to smoothen a pathway to the senior national team.The team is in Kolkata where they will train before setting off for Dushanbe on June 16.",India U-23 coach Naushad Moosa has been handed a long-term contract by the AIFF.

Jadon Sancho will leave Chelsea when his loan spell ends on June 30 after failing to agree on personal terms for a permanent transfer, despite having helped the club secure Champions League qualification with a fourth-place Premier League finish. The Englishman scoring in the UEFA Conference League final against Real Betis was not enough to hand him a permanent deal at Stamford Bridge.The 25-year-old winger joined Chelsea last summer from Manchester United on a temporary deal that included a £25million obligation to buy clause, subject to personal terms being agreed upon with the player.However, the club have opted against it and will now have to pay a fine of £5million to get out of the obligation. The Manchester United player, who still has a year left on his deal at Old Trafford is now exploring options both in England and across Europe for his next move.During his time at Chelsea, Sancho's numbers did not amount to anything significant, although he bagged five goals and ten assists in 42 appearances across all competitions.Speaking after the Conference League final, Maresca addressed Sancho's future, stating: ""From now on is when we sit down with the club and decide about next year.""The manager further praised Sancho's contribution, saying: ""Jadon Sancho, if we finished fourth, it's because of Jadon, if we won tonight it's because of Jadon. It's also because of Robert Sanchez — during the season, everyone is up and down a little bit, that's part of the game. ""While unable to strike a deal with the Blues, the 25-year-old is on the lookout for a new club, be it in the Premier League or elsewhere. While United prepares to negotiate with other clubs to offload the high-wage winger, who reportedly makes close to£300,000 a week, his current wage may prevent a permanent deal from materialising. Sancho has been linked with the likes of West Ham United and the Saudi Pro League.","Jadon Sancho will leave Chelsea when his loan spell ends on June 30.

Paris Saint-Germain - UEFA Champions League





Paris Saint-Germain winning the UEFA Champions League for the first time in its history puts an end to one of the longest searches for European glory. Established in 1970, the French side were yet to taste European success prior to the final at the Allianz Arena on Saturday. Luis Enrique and his men made easy work of Simone Inzaghi's Inter as they steamrolled the Italians 5-0 in the final. While PSG's victory tops off an exhilarating Champions League season, it wasn't just the Parisiens that put an end to their trophy drought.The 2024/25 season will be remembered as the year many teams across Europe put an end to their quest for silverware. With PSG being the latest addition to the list, teams like Tottenham Hotspur, Crystal Palace, Newcastle United and Bayern Munich's Harry Kane have all added trophies to their cabinets. Here's a closer look at how this year proved to be pivotal in the quest for silverware for several teams.Led by Ange Postecoglou from the dugout, Tottenham Hotspur were in the quest for a trophy to put an end to their excruciating 17-year search for silverware. Spurs, often mocked for their inability to claim trophies, further stacked the odds against their favour, when Postecoglou claimed that he 'usually wins trophies in his second season'.With an emphatic win over Premier League rivals Manchester United in the final, Spurs finally put an end to their search for a trophy. Brennan Johnson scored the winner in a narrow 1-0 win.The Eagles clinched a trophy for the first time in 120 years after a major upset in the FA Cup final. After losing twice in the final of the same competition, in 1990 and 2016, Palace beat Manchester City in the 2025 final 1-0 thanks to a goal from Eberechi Eze. The result meant that City went trophyless for the first time since 2016 and Palace claimed their first-ever FA Cup.Newcastle United claimed a major domestic trophy for the first time since 1955 as they beat Premier League champions Liverpool 2-1 in the final. Goals from Dan Burn and Alexander Isak ensured that the side managed by Eddie Howe put an end to the 70-year wait. The title triumph was Newcastle's first since the 1955 FA Cup win.In the same year Tottenham Hotspur won the UEFA Europa League, former club captain and current Bayern Munich striker Harry Kane also ended his search for a maiden career trophy. Despite joining the Bavarians last season, the Englishman ended his debut season in Germany without any trophy to show for it.However, after a dominant Bundesliga campaign in which he topped the goal scoring charts with 26 strikes, Bayern claimed back the German league title from Bayer Leverkusen, who ended Bayern's streak of 11 successive Bundesliga titles last season.Ever since the French side was taken over by the sovereign-wealth fund of Qatar in 2011, PSG has kept it a priority to get their hands on the UCL trophy. However, despite heavy spending and bringing in top talent from across Europe, the Parisiens kept falling short of the ultimate prize.Lionel Messi, Neymar Jr. and even Kylian Mbappe failed to bring European glory to the club. However, Luis Enrique's side, led by Ousmane Dembele in attack finally clinched the biggest club competition with a 5-0 win over Inter.","Paris Saint-Germain won the UEFA Champions League for the first time.

Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) fans recoiled in shock with a stunned silence after Barcelona pulled off a historic comeback in the second leg of their Champions League 2016/17 Round of 16 match. The Spanish giants became the first team in the European tournament's history to overturn a 4-0 deficit, defying odds of 200/1.""We lost everything in the closing minutes,"" said PSG manager Unai Emery. While Neymar delivered a performance for the ages, it was Barca manager Luis Enrique who maintained belief despite a scenario where the vast majority hardly gave the Spanish side a 1 percent chance of qualification. ""If they can score four goals, we can score six. Infinite things can happen,"" maintained Enrique, setting the stage for an extraordinary 6-1 comeback win.While Emery soon made his way out, the 'chokers tag' became ingrained in the club's identity. PSG never really managed to overcome the horrors of that night at Camp Nou, surrendering the momentum yet again in the 2018-19 edition of the Champions League. The French club pulled off a 2-0 win against Manchester United at Old Trafford in the first leg of their quarter-final.However, PSG again failed to get the job done in the second leg, losing 1-3 and crashing out. Even the presence of Neymar, who was signed from Barcelona for a record sum, as well as Kylian Mbappe, proved insufficient.While PSG's fortunes in the Champions League did improve over the years, reaching the tournament's final in the 2019-20 edition, inability to hold on under pressure stood out like a sore thumb. Mbappe and Neymar failed to convert chances as Bayern Munich pulled off a clinical win. While PSG owner Nasser Al-Khelaifi had made the club's desire to win the Champions League amply clear, fortune simply failed to swing in their favour despite the addition of Lionel Messi.PSG's tendency to commit harakiri remained constant in the 2021/22 edition, especially during their Round of 16 match against Real Madrid. The French club leaked three goals in 17 minutes, crashing out of the competition following a 2-3 loss on aggregate.As the managerial merry-go-round continued, Khelaifi took a drastic and controversial decision by appointing Enrique as the manager at the start of the 2023/24 season. The move was certainly unpopular among the PSG fans, considering the Spaniard's 'persona non grata' status after the pain he had subjected them to. Well, who can begrudge unwillingness to face your worst nightmare on a daily basis?Enrique stamped his philosophy from the first day itself, terming the situation at PSG ""chaotic"" and shocking. While managers had previously been quite cautious while dealing with Mbappe, the Spaniard openly highlighted his lack of desire to defend. ""A little bit more normalcy does no harm,” said Enrique.There was complete focus on work rate, with players dropped irrespective of their profile in case of any drop in standards. While players and agents earlier attempted to manipulate the manager through external pressure, none of that worked in this case, as Enrique strongly went about his philosophy. Young talents like Willian Pacho, Desire Doue, Bradley Barcola, and Vitinha made their way in as PSG shifted their focus from the biggest names to building a strong core.The Spaniard won over fans by giving Barcelona a taste of their own medicine in the 2023/24 quarter-finals. PSG overturned a 2-3 deficit by recording a comprehensive 4-1 win in the second leg, as the Parisians pulled off their own 'La Remontada'. However, there was more work in store for Enrique as he soon realised following a 2-0 loss on aggregate against Borussia Dortmund in the semi-finals. PSG hit the woodwork six times but failed to score a single goal.There was further an unexpected blow in store for Enrique as Mbappe forced a move to Real Madrid, depriving the Parisians of their top goal-scorer. While other managers would've been perturbed, the former Barcelona manager remained nonplussed. ""Our game does not consist in letting Mbappé do what he wants. That was the old philosophy which never won a major trophy. We are better in attack without him,"" he said.While such strong words could have made him a laughing stock, Enrique went about rebuilding with gusto, building a strong setup around attackers Ousmane Dembele, Goncalo Ramos and Doué. Dembele found his feet after being sidelined at Barcelona, scoring 33 goals in 45 matches this season. While PSG reached the Champions League 2024/25 final against Inter Milan, who'd been beaten only once the entire season, naysayers predicted them to perish yet again.However, Enrique's side showcased a strong display of intent, recording the biggest win in a Champions League final with five goals. PSG finally managed to win the Champions League for the first time, pulling off a feat which had seemed jinxed at one stage. Doue chipped in with a brace while another young prospect Senny Mayulu scored the final goal, showcasing the wealth of talent in PSG's kitty. Enrique wept tears of joy, having gifted everlasting peace to the PSG fans after tormenting them for eight years.",Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) have struggled in the Champions League. Luis Enrique was appointed as the French club's manager at the start of the 2023/24 season.

Poll Should Inter Milan retain manager Simone Inzaghi after the Champions League final loss? Yes, he deserves more time No, it's time for a change





""We are meeting with the coach because this club is not used to letting a manager go into the final year of his contract. There is no revolution underway. We will meet to hear what he has to say, I repeat, on our part, we are very proud and honoured to continue with him,"" he said.Inter suffered a devastating loss at the hands of Paris Saint-Germain in the final of the UEFA Champions League on Saturday at the Allianz Arena in Munich. The Parisiens put five past the Italian giants in a heavily one-sided final, as the Nerazzurri looked helpless against a relentless PSG onslaught.Following the result, Italian media reported that Inzaghi could depart as early as this month, ahead of the Club World Cup in the United States, scheduled from June 14 to July 13. However, Inter Milan president Giuseppe Marotta has confirmed the club wants to retain the manager despite Saturday's result, with discussions set to begin this week. Inzaghi's contract with the club expires next year in June.PSG claimed their first-ever Champions League title with the largest winning margin ever seen in a final. On the other hand, Inzaghi's Inter fell in the final once again, with the score line far worse than the 1-0 loss to Pep Guardiola's Manchester City in Istanbul in 2023.""This defeat will not have an impact. Inzaghi has a contract for another year and we had already decided to meet with him this week,"" Marotta told reporters after the match in Munich. ""Almost all the credit for this positive cycle is due to his professionalism and abilities. If he wants to continue, we are happy.""Inter staged an inspirational run to the final of the Champions League, and were in the running for an iconic treble up until a little over a month ago. However, a late slip up in Serie A and loss to AC Milan in the semi-final of the Coppa Italia means that Inter will now end the season trophyless.""We are meeting with the coach because this club is not used to letting a manager go into the final year of his contract. There is no revolution underway. We will meet to hear what he has to say, I repeat, on our part, we are very proud and honoured to continue with him,"" he said.Looking to put the difficult result behind them, the president said, ""Let's quickly forget and look to the next one, with the new start of the Club World Cup. We will be representing Italy together with Juventus.""","Inter Milan president Giuseppe Marotta confirms the club wants to retain manager Simone Inzaghi.

IPL 2025 Winner Prediction: What Greenstone Lobo's Astrology says

Poll Should Inter Kashi continue their appeal at the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS)? Yes, they deserve another hearing. No, the decision should stand.





The I-League title race has taken another turn after the AIFF appeals committee adjudged that Inter Kashi fielded an ineligible player for multiple games in the second leg of the competition.The appeals committee heard an appeal from Churchill Brothers, Namdhari FC and Real Kashmir, and ruled that the re-registration of Mario Barco by Inter Kashi made him an ineligible player. “The rules do not provide for re-registration for anyone who has been ousted from the season due to a season ending injury/illness,” chairperson of appeals committee Rajesh Tandon said in the order on Saturday.The appeals committee had earlier rejected Kashi’s plea against Namdhari fielding an ineligible player to announce Churchill as champions. Kashi have challenged the decision at the Lausanne-based Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) where the matter is expected to be decided later this month.In the provisional standings, Churchill had 40 points, a point more than Kashi, while Real Kashmir were third with 37 points. The appeals committee order means Kashi’s games where Mario was fielded would result in forfeiture. Churchill will now get two additional points, taking their points tally to an unassailable 42, regardless of the pending appeal before CAS.“Churchill Brothers, with 42 points, are the undisputed champions,” Churchill said on Tuesday. “After this order, Churchill’s championship win has been affirmed. The I-League trophy will continue to be in Goa. Churchill Brothers are grateful to the judicial bodies as they have rightfully upheld our legitimate claims.”Kashi said they would appeal against the judgement at CAS, just like they have done with the previous order where three points allotted to them by the disciplinary committee were returned to Namdhari by the appeals committee.“While it is unfortunate that Inter Kashi has to approach CAS yet again for a truly free and fair hearing of the matter, it seems to be the new reality of Indian football. The club is flabbergasted that such simple rules and regulations can be twisted and misinterpreted in such a manner through which the club is now suffering without any fault of its own,” Kashi said in a statement.Records suggest that Mario was part of Kashi’s initial squad – which included six foreigners -- for the I-League but was later replaced by Matija Babovic due to what was seen as a season-ending injury. The Spanish striker, however, continued to remain contracted with the club and made a return to the team on Feb 26, 2025 since Julen Perez’s contract termination during the January transfer window left a vacant foreign spot.According to the order, the federation’s competitions department disallowed Kashi from re-registering Mario on Feb 2, insisting that the request did not comply with clause 6.5.7 of the I-League regulations which states that a foreign player can only be replaced by another foreign player in case an injury or illness prevents the player from continuing to play for the rest of the competition or after mutual termination of the contract.Kashi appealed the decision with the AIFF League Committee which said on Feb 15 that a majority of its members were in favour of approving the club's request to add back player Mario Barco.Kashi fielded Mario for their games starting Feb 26 against Rajasthan United.In its order, the appeals committee said there is no power of review available with the League Committee in I-League regulations. “A power not available in a statute cannot be exercised by a body which itself is a creature of the statute,” the order noted.“The unlawful inclusion of a foreign player provided Inter Kashi with an unfair advantage over other clubs adhering to the prescribed regulations,” stated the order. “Such a violation directly undermines the principles of fair play and the integrity of the I-League. Furthermore, not penalising such a violation would encourage resource-wealthy clubs to buy and rotate more foreign players in their squads. This would directly undermine the principles of equity and equal opportunities which has made the I-League one of the most renowned football leagues of this country till now. ”",Churchill Brothers will be allotted two additional points after Inter Kashi fielded ‘ineligible’ Mario Barco in their draw against the former champions at Raia Panaji.

Norman Nato currently competes for Nissan in Formula E. He was earlier a part of Andretti before joining Nissan last year.

Pascal Wehrlein on winning in Shanghai

TAG Heuer Porsche gained big in Shanghai





TAG Heuer Porsche driver Pascal Wehrlein gained no points on Day 1 of the Shanghai E-Prix last weekend. However, the Formula E driver was able to turn the tables in a rainy race the next day and claim second place on the podium. After the race, he confirmed that the result made him realise they were actually competitive on a wet track.Pascal Wehrlein secured second place in the Round 11 race in Shanghai, with his teammate Antonio Felix Da Costa joining him on the podium in third. The two had started in the same positions on the grid but in reverse order. It was, nevertheless, a double gain for Porsche on Sunday.Talking about the Round 11 race, Wehrlein said, “Very tricky conditions especially in the beginning, I think it got a little bit better towards the end, but our pace was good. Not good enough for P1, but quite far ahead of the guys behind. Personally I’m very happy about the result today because today was the first time that I felt like we were very competitive in the wet, which wasn’t the case in Tokyo and Monaco. I think we’ve found a good way there and in the end a happy ending for us. ”The two also scored double podiums at the Mexico E-Prix and then again in Miami, where Wehrlein won. He earned another podium at the Tokyo E-Prix.With such a strong performance this year, Wehrlein currently holds second place in the Formula E Driver Standings with 103 points.“It was a very strong result today in very tricky and challenging wet conditions,” Porsche Formula E boss Florian Modlinger stated after the double podium in Round 11. The 34 points earned from the results, plus the fastest lap by Wehrlein, also promoted Porsche to the top of the Teams’ World Championship—by a single point ahead of Nissan.“We are really happy with these points and regaining the lead in the Teams’ Championship by a single point. It will be a very hard fight to the end of the year. Overall – with three Porsche in the top six with Nico Mueller – we can be very happy,” Modlinger added.Also Read: Nick Cassidy on winning Round 11 race at Shanghai E-Prix: “It feels like we’ve been waiting a long time” Wehrlein and Da Costa will now be eyeing more such wins, with five more races remaining before the Formula E season wraps up for the year.

George Russell hinted at Dan Ticktum while commenting on Spanish Grand Prix incident

Dan Ticktum responds to George Russell’s remark





Cupra Kiro driver Dan Ticktum has reacted to Formula 1 driver George Russell’s “one British driver in Formula E” mention when the latter was asked if he had ever seen a driver who did what F1 champion Max Verstappen did, that is, deliberately hitting another during a race. Ticktum responded to Russell’s remark by thanking him for “free publicity” and likening himself to none other than Verstappen, who is currently the reigning number 1 champion in Formula 1.Red Bull driver Max Verstappen was handed a 10-second penalty during the race and a three-point penalty on his licence for hitting George Russell’s Mercedes during the Spanish Grand Prix. One more mistake and he can face a one-race ban. When Russell was asked if he had seen any other driver do such a thing, he told the media, ""Not in Formula 1. Maybe in Formula E. Maybe one British driver in Formula E.”Dan Ticktum took note of Russell’s mention. Ticktum had received a two-year ban for deliberately hitting another driver during an MSA Formula (now British F4) race. He recently clinched his first podium of the season at the Tokyo E-Prix.Taking to Instagram to share a recorded response to Russell’s remark, Ticktum said, ""I have just had a very nice evening with the team and some of the guys from Porsche here in Shanghai.I’m just on the way back to the hotel. It has come to my attention via the Twittersphere that a certain driver in Formula 1 - not to name names but his name is George Russell - has made some rather choice comments about a certain Formula E driver. ”Thanking Russell for the mention, he further said, ""He hasn't named my name, but it's quite obviously pointed at me. We'd like to address those comments that he made I believe on the team radio. Number one, thank you for the free publicity. We'll take that any day of the week. And two, while what Max did today was a little bit sceptical, to be likened to him at any point in my career is a positive if you ask me.

I was sitting at the back for a very long time; I was quite good on energy but I didn’t understand how the race was playing out. The team did a great job with the strategy because I came out of the pit lane in sixth so I thought, ‘now I can fight!’, but I need to look at the race after to understand a little bit better what’s actually happened. I was really struggling with energy on the last couple of laps so I did my best in the last few corners. I’m super happy to get another podium, another 15 points in the bag.”On Sunday, Barnard finished tenth in the second race of the Shanghai double-header but was glad he finished it safely as he raced on a wet track in the rain.

Antonio Felix Da Costa, who won the last Formula E race in Shanghai, made sure he didn’t go home empty-handed this time. The TAG Heuer Porsche driver was pleased to finish third on the podium at the Shanghai E-Prix and also expressed happiness for winner Nick Cassidy of Jaguar TCS Racing.

I felt like my balance wasn’t quite there and I really struggled with my rears, so it wasn’t enjoyable and it was very hard to keep the car on track. I was slow to be honest, but good enough for a podium – two cars from the team are on the podium so that’s always positive.”Talking about his third-place finish, he added, “I’m happy for Nick [Cassidy], he did a really good job, but we’ve got good points. Starting second and finishing third is not ideal – in the beginning I thought we had something, but then it was clear to me that I didn’t have the pace of the two cars in front, so it was all about bringing the podium home.”Antonio now stands third in the 2025 Formula E Driver Standings with 88 points.Taking to Instagram after the race, Antonio Felix Da Costa shared a picture of himself spraying champagne from the podium.

After the win, he said, “Amazing! A 1-2 for the team, I’m so happy. A real masterclass this race, I think the strategy, the pace, the execution, the moves – everything was nice. I knew when I put the overlap on Oli [Rowland] and had more energy, I just had to go and get my head down and try to be secure, which we managed.I’m extremely happy. It means a lot, especially after these last few weeks when momentum was not on our side. This weekend we certainly got it back!

I left a little bit of my front wing in the last corner, I think a bit of my wrist as well – I was suffering the whole race, I really hurt it. Honestly I don’t know, I just went for it – I think we did the right call keeping the Attack Mode quite late. Everybody was attacking a lot and I thought that since everyone was doing that I should save a bit more energy and try to use it towards the end, and it paid off quite nicely. ”Also Read: Shanghai E-Prix 2025: DS celebrates double victory as Maximilian Gunther takes first, Jean-Eric Vergne second in Round 10, Taylor Barnard claims third The Formula E drivers now prepare for the second race of the Shanghai E-Prix.

France's 361st-ranked Lois Boisson continued her ""incredible"" Paris adventure on Wednesday, dispatching world number six Mirra Andreeva in a thrilling two-set battle to reach the French Open semi-finals.Boisson triumphed 7-6 (8/6), 6-3 in just over two hours against Russian teenager Andreeva in front of an ecstatic home crowd on Court Philippe Chatrier, collapsing on the red clay after sealing victory on her first match point.""It was incredible to play in front of this crowd and to feel support like that.

You know, I hope everyone will be respectful and things. If not, it's cool.""Boisson becomes the lowest-ranked major semi-finalist in the last 40 years.Winner of the Saint Malo tournament on the secondary circuit in 2024, she seriously injured her left knee just before Roland Garros 12 months ago.""What happened last year was the toughest moment of my life,"" said the player from Dijon, who had only won one match on the main circuit before Roland Garros -- at the modest WTA 250 in Rouen on clay in April.She is the third player to reach the semi-finals in her Grand Slam main-draw debut since 1980, following Monica Seles and Jennifer Capriati who also did it at Roland Garros in 1989 and 1990.She becomes the first French semi-finalist at her home Grand Slam event since Marion Bartoli in 2011 -- and the first in the Open Era to do it as a wild card.","Lois Boisson beats Mirra Andreeva 7-6 (8-6), 6-3 to reach French Open semi- finals.

IPL 2025 Final | Rishi Sunak Interview: 'I am a big Virat Kohli fan... RCB is my team'





PARIS - Coco Gauff overcame 10 double-faults and the first set she's dropped in the tournament to beat Madison Keys 6-7 (6), 6-4, 6-1 at the French Open on Wednesday, reaching the semifinals for the third time.It was a contest filled with plenty of mistakes by both Americans, who each has claimed one major championship. They combined for 101 unforced errors and just 40 winners across more than two hours under a closed roof at Court Philippe-Chatrier on a drizzly, chilly day.The No. 2-seeded Gauff won the 2023 U.S. Open and was the runner-up at the 2022 French Open. She'll play Thursday for a berth in another Grand Slam final, facing either No. 6 Mirra Andreeva or 361st-ranked French wild-card entry Lois Boisson.""I have a lot more work left to do,"" said Gauff, who raised her arms overhead then spread them wide apart after the last point against Keys, ""but I'm going to savor this one today.""She started particularly poorly against Keys, trailing 4-1 and being a point from a 5-1 deficit. Gauff bowed her head or sighed after some miscues. Then, suddenly, she got going, using her speed and instincts to stretch points until Keys - the Australian Open champion in January - missed.That helped Gauff get within a point of taking that set. But the 21-year-old based in Florida double-faulted three times in the tiebreaker, and soon was headed to the locker room to regroup.That set was sloppy. Gauff had seven winners to 21 unforced errors. Keys has 12 winners to 28 unforced errors, 19 of which arrived from her powerful forehand.Quiz: Who's that IPL player? ""I knew that I just had to be able to run today and as soon as the ball came short,"" Gauff said, ""just punish her for it.""Repeatedly, Gauff scrambled this way or that to get her racket on a shot from Keys that against plenty of other players would end the point. And often enough, it worked well, leading to a miss by Keys, who occasionally admonished herself with a slap on her right leg.""With her ability to cover the court,"" Keys said, ""you're going to have to win the point multiple times before it's actually over.""","Coco Gauff beat Madison Keys 6-7 (6), 6-4, 6-1 at the French Open on Wednesday. The No. 2-seeded Gauff won the 2023 U.S. Open and was the runner-up at the 2022 French Open.

'A particularly special feeling': Andy Flower hails Virat Kohli, RCB after historic title win

Poll Do you think Hitesh Chauhan has the potential to become a top player? Yes, he has great talent No, he needs more experience It’s too early to tell





: Qualifier Hitesh Chauhan went down fighting 2-6, 6-2, 6-7 (6) to sixth-seeded American Benjamin Willwerth in the second round of the French Open boys singles at Roland Garros.Hitesh, ranked 83, the last player into the qualifying draw, weathered four matches in five days and was running low on energy on Tuesday. His groundstrokes fell short and his court coverage a tad slow.The Indian, who settled down in the second set, running down the drop shots Willwerth threw at him, worked his way into the contest with his own mix of underspin, to eventually level set scores.In the third game (30-15) of the third set, Hitesh took a tumble while chasing a drop shot. He rolled over his shoulder and the trainer was called on court. The 17-year-old responded to the situation admirably, he returned to the court and won three of the next four games to take a 4-2 lead.

Frances Tiafoe expressed frustration after losing to Lorenzo Musetti in the French Open quarterfinals on Tuesday, criticising officials for only issuing a warning when Musetti accidentally hit a line judge with a kicked tennis ball during their match at Court Philippe-Chatrier.The incident occurred when Musetti, trailing 5-3 in the second set, kicked a ball that struck a female line judge. He received just a warning for the code violation, allowing him to continue playing.""I mean, obviously, he did that, and nothing happened. I think that's comical,"" No. 15 seed Tiafoe said after his 6-2, 4-6, 7-5, 6-2 loss to No. 8 Musetti. ""Nothing happened, so there's nothing really to talk about. Obviously, it's not consistent, so it is what it is.""Musetti defended the incident as unintentional and expressed concern for the line judge's wellbeing.""Honestly, it was a really unlucky coincidence. I was a little bit, honestly, scared, because I really didn't want to harm (anybody), of course. So I immediately went to the line umpire, and I of course said, 'Sorry, I apologise to everyone,'"" Musetti said. ""It was right to have a warning, but I think the umpire saw that there was no intention about that, and that's why probably (he) let me continue.""Similar incidents in the past have resulted in player disqualifications, notably at the 2020 US Open when Novak Djokovic was eliminated after accidentally hitting a female line judge in the throat with a ball between games.The match highlighted ongoing debates about officiating at Roland-Garros, where human line judges are still used instead of electronic line-calling systems common at other major tournaments.Tiafoe also disputed several line calls during the match, including one that television replay showed he was correct about.The female line judge who was hit continued to officiate throughout the match.Despite winning the second set after the incident, Tiafoe ultimately lost as Musetti claimed the final two sets to advance to his first Roland-Garros semifinals.","Frances Tiafoe criticises officials for only issuing a warning when Lorenzo Musetti accidentally hit a line judge with a kicked tennis ball.

: Lorenzo Musetti, the single-handed backhand’s newest ambassador, covered his already stirring 2025 European clay court swing in glory, by making the semifinals of the French Open for the first time. The inform Italian claimed a 6-2, 4-6, 7-5, 6-2 win over American Frances Tiafoe, winning eight of the final ten games.Musetti, 23, ranked seven in the world, was lucky not to be defaulted when he unintentionally kicked a ball which hit a line judge. No one was hurt, but by the letter of the law, which is open to interpretation, the curtain could’ve come down on his clay court season. “Today it was really complicated to play well,” Musetti said.“It was so windy. It was really tough but I found the extra energy.”“We’re Italian, we’re all elegant,” he said of his play. “I have a retro style, there aren’t many players who play a one-handed backhand. When I got my first tennis racket, for me it was natural to play a one-handed backhand. My coach didn’t change it.”","Lorenzo Musetti beats Frances Tiafoe 6-2, 4-6, 7-5,6-2 at Roland Garros.

: The only thing louder than Aryna Sabalenka’s grunt – “aaahhhhrrrrrhhhhaaaa” – that rises in decibels with the velocity of her shot, is her explosive game.The 5 ft 11’ Belarusian, arguably the most powerful player the women’s game has ever known, produced an exhibition of all things bold and beautiful against Qinwen Zheng in the French Open quarterfinals on Tuesday. The 27-year-old World No.1’s 7-6 (3), 6-3 win against the eighth-seeded Chinese took her to her second semifinal at Roland Garros.Qinwen, the stylish 22-year-old, ran Sabalenka close in the opening set, breaking early and taking a breezy lead, but the top-seed came back swinging, the acoustics dizzying, as she levelled at 4-4. In the tie-break, Sabalenka won five of the last six points, dictating play with the might of her shot making.The Chinese pro, who left the court after the first set, tried to change the pace of play in the second. Her shots still flat and without shape, however, played into the world No.1’s hands.Qinwen went up 0-30 on Sabalenka’s serve in the second game and perhaps sighted an opening, but when the Belarusian claimed the next four points and levelled at 1-1 in the second set, Qinwen looked up at her box and let the frustration show.Sabalenka struck on the second opportunity in the fifth game of the second set, clocking a two-hander down the line to seal the break. Qinwin hit right back, with winners off both flanks in the next game. Sabalenka pushed the repeat button in the seventh game and then held serve to take a 5-3 lead before pulling off another break in the ninth game to close the match.Sabalenka, who has played 473 matches in her career, said she has never faced an opponent with a game more powerful than hers on a tennis court.“I don’t care if the player is going to go out there and try to overhit me or if they try to change the rhythm and make me move and run,” she said, adding, “Over the years my game has evolved, I’m ready to play against whoever is going to make me run and work for the point. But when it comes to power, I like it, because then it is, okay, you want to see the power? Let me show you something.”Sabalenka was reminded of her only meeting with the legendary Serena Williams four years ago in Melbourne Park, the American coming through in three sets. After the match, Williams said, “If she wants to play power, let’s go.”Sabalenka found Williams’ observation interesting. “I think that she wasn’t more powerful than (me), physically she was better than me (in that match), and she put more balls back on my side than I did (on her side),” she said of the round-of-16 clash. “I didn’t feel that she overpowered me in that game.”Sabalenka has over the years used the dimensions of the court well, using underspin to get back into the point and also throwing in drop shots against opponents who retreat to play her power. “The drop shot is something we’ve been working on over the last couple of years,” she said. “But I’m going to play with my power, because that is something I feel the most comfortable with.”In Thursday’s semifinals, the Belarusian will play four-time champion, Iga Swiatek, the world No. 5, who put out Elina Svitolina 6-1, 7-5.","Aryna Sabalenka beat Qinwen Zheng 7-6 (3), 6-3 at Roland Garros.

Paris, Jun 03, 2025 -Triple-defending champion Iga Swiatek marched into the last four at Roland Garros on Tuesday with a straight-sets victory over 13th seed Elina Svitolina.Swiatek bested the former world number three 6-1, 7-5 in just over 90 minutes on Court Philippe Chatrier to continue her bid to equal a 102-year record by winning four successive French Open titles.The Polish fifth seed will face world number one Aryna Sabalenka in the semi-finals after the Belarusian earlier bested Olympic champion Zheng Qinwen in the last eight.""Aryna is always a challenge, she has a game for every surface. I need to focus on myself, do the work and just go for it,"" said Swiatek.The rivals have never met at Roland Garros, but Swiatek emerged the victor in their last two meetings on clay -- in the finals of the Madrid and Italian Opens last season.""It's going to be a tough match but I'm happy for the challenge,"" the 24-year-old added.After starting sluggishly in her fourth-round win over former Wimbledon winner Elena Rybakina, where Swiatek found herself 6-1, 2-0 down before kicking into gear, she hit the ground running on Tuesday.Swiatek broke Svitolina's serve in the fourth game to take a 3-1 lead, before outlasting her opponent in two lengthy, tightly-contested games to consolidate her advantage.Quiz: Who's that IPL player? The five-time Grand Slam winner then served out the opener to 15 on a gusty centre court in Paris.The pair exchanged consecutive breaks of serve early in the second set, but neither could seize the advantage until Swiatek forced the breakthrough at 5-5 with a powerful forehand down the line.Swiatek showed her killer instinct by holding again to 15 and sealing the win with back-to-back aces.Defeat for Svitolina means the 30-year-old Ukrainian has never progressed further than the quarter-finals at Roland Garros despite reaching the last-eight stage five times in her career.","Iga Swiatek beats Elina Svitolina 6-1, 7-5 to reach French Open semi-finals. Polish fifth seed will face world number one Aryna Sabalenka in the last four.

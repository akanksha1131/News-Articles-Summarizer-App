'Anxious' Ancelotti makes more history

Doha: Kylian Mbappe and Vinicius Junior both scored as Real Madrid cruised to a 3-0 victory over Mexican side Pachuca in the Intercontinental Cup final in Doha on Wednesday.Mbappe opened the scoring in the 37th minute before Rodrygo doubled Madrid's lead early in the second half. Vinicius sealed a comfortable win for the Spanish and European champions with a late penalty.France striker Mbappe returned to the Madrid line-up in Doha after missing Saturday's 3-3 draw with Rayo Vallecano due to a hamstring injury suffered in the Champions League win at Atalanta last week.Mbappe swept in from close range to break the deadlock after brilliant play from Vinicius Junior, who won the FIFA Best men's player of the year award a day earlier after missing out on the Ballon d'Or Former West Brom and Newcastle forward Salomon Rondon led the attack for CONCACAF Champions Cup winners Pachuca, but they never truly looked capable of an upset and Rodrygo's fine curling strike from the edge of the area put Madrid in total control.It was allowed to stand after the referee consulted the pitchside monitor even though Jude Bellingham was in an offside position and appeared to be interfering with the goalkeeper's line of vision.Vinicius added a third from the penalty spot six minutes from time following another VAR review after Lucas Vazquez was chopped down in the Pachuca box.""We knew that after a long trip and playing just one game it's hard. We struggled at the beginning, but we adapted well,"" Madrid midfielder Fede Valverde told Spanish television channel Telecinco.It is Madrid's second title of the season following their UEFA Super Cup triumph over Atalanta in August, a welcome boost after what coach Carlo Ancelotti admitted had been a difficult period.""In this part of the season I was a bit anxious because I didn't like the team, honestly, but this will change in 2025 I'm sure,"" said Ancelotti.""It's important for us to get to Christmas alive. If we think about the team after the defeat by Milan (in the Champions League on November 5), I think we've grown a lot and that gives us confidence for 2025.""Ancelotti won his 15th trophy as Madrid coach, moving him past Miguel Munoz for the most in the club's history.""It's a nice moment. It's an honour for me. Madrid are the club that everybody wants to coach because they're the best club in the world,"" said Ancelotti.""It's easier than winning them in other places because you have a great team and fanbase.""This was the first edition of the FIFA-backed Intercontinental Cup, which broadly maintains the previous format of the Club World Cup and features the six continental champions.The latter is being expanded to include 32 teams in 2025 and will now be played every four years. A past version of the Intercontinental Cup ran from 1960 to 2004 involving the champions of Europe and South America.Madrid won that competition three times and then lifted the Club World Cup on a record five occasions.They are to due to play Pachuca again at next year's Club World Cup in the United States, as well as an Al Hilal team including Neymar, and Red Bull Salzburg.Madrid host Sevilla in La Liga on Sunday in their final game of the year.

R Ashwin announces retirement from Test cricket

Rohit Sharma press conference: On Ashwin, Gabba draw and his form

BRISBANE: The announcement was made. R Ashwin was no longer going to be an India cricketer and as the whole of India reacted to the shocking retirement, there was this stormy calm at The Gabba . The drizzle continued and the floodlights were still on as the broadcast crew worked in overdrive to safely pack their equipment before calling it a day. Both teams had left the venue, most gates were shut but there was a large goods vehicle parked close to gate No. 6.Three stockily built gentlemen were doing the heavy lifting and loading the kitbags of Indian cricketers into the truck. It's a usual practice to send the kits and other heavy equipment before the team departs to their next destination but the cargo will now be a bag less as Ashwin's gear will be directed to Chennai instead of Melbourne.The warm hug with Virat Kohli in the change room had fuelled speculation before India's greatest off-spinner dropped the bombshell at the post-match press-conference. Known for his meticulous ways of going about things, it was a rather snap announcement by Ashwin who had his captain and long-time teammate Rohit Sharma by his side.""I am not going to take too much of your time. This will be my last year as an Indian cricketer in all formats at the international level. I do feel there is a bit of punch left in me as a cricketer but I would like to expose and probably showcase that in club level cricket but this will be the last day,"" came the announcement.No excessive use of words or adjectives and the 38-year-old called time on his international career spanning over 15 years. He remembered his teammates, the ""last bunch of OGs"", Rohit, Virat Kohli, Ajinkya Rahane and Cheteshwar Pujara and thanked them for taking those catches in close-in positions.""There are a lot of people to thank but I would be failing in my duties if I didn't thank the BCCI and the fellow team mates. I want to name a few of them. All the coaches who have been a part of the journey, most importantly Rohit, Virat, Ajinkya, Pujara who have taken those splendid catches around the bag to give me the number of wickets I have managed to get over the years,"" he added with the wit still intact.Ashwin, who played one of the three Tests in the series, didn't stay in the media room for more than a few minutes and made his way out to a rapturous applause. The announcement was snap, the news came as a shocker but the great man had it all figured in his head during the first Test in Perth. Jasprit Bumrah was the stand-in captain for that game but the moment Rohit arrived, Ashwin broke the news to his captain and it was only after a lot of convincing that he agreed to play the Adelaide fixture.""I heard this when I came to Perth. Obviously I was not there for the first three or four days of the Test match, but this was in his mind since then. There are obviously a lot of things that went behind it. I am pretty sure Ash when in position will be able to answer that.""But he understands what the team is thinking, he understands what kind of combinations we are thinking and you know when we came here as well we were not sure about which spinner is going to play... we just wanted to assess and see what kind of conditions we get in front of us but yeah when I arrived in Perth, this was a chat we had and I somehow convinced him to stay for that pink ball Test,"" reveals Rohit.In the lone outing with the ball, the offie sent down 18 overs and returned with the solitary wicket of Mitchell Marsh. There was a handy contribution with the bat in the first innings, too, but not many would have guessed that this was going to be his last appearance for the Indian cricket team.Who would have thought that the kitbag which landed on Australian soil in Perth would be doing a mid-series re-route from Brisbane to Chennai, instead of Brisbane-Melbourne-Sydney-Chennai.In a snap of a finger, the professor of spin bowling, one of India's greatest match-winners in Tests, the quintessential team man and an asset for every captain left with a question on every lip: Why now?","R Ashwin announces retirement from Test cricket.

After dropping KL Rahul on his overnight score of 33, Steve Smith came up with a one-handed blinder in the slips to deny the Indian opener a well-deserved century after leading India's fight on day four of the Brisbane Test at the Gabba .Tuesday got off to a dramatic start when Rahul edged Pat Cummins on the first ball of the day but heaved a sigh of relief to see Smith dropping a sitter at second slip.It cost Australia as Rahul added another 51 runs to his and India's score before he tried to cut off-spinner Nathan Lyon off while rocking back on a length delivery and got a thick outside edge that looked like flying past Smith's outstretched right arm before it stuck in his palm.It ended Rahul's knock of 84 and his 67-run partnership with Ravindra Jadeja.India started the day at a precarious 51 for 4 in reply to Australia's first innings total of 445, which included centuries from Travis Head (152) and Smith (101).It soon became 74 for 5 after captain Rohit Sharma (10) fell early in the day, edging Cummins to wicketkeeper Alex Carey.Conditions at the Gabba remained overcast, and the first session on Tuesday saw rain interrupting play briefly.The five-Test Border Gavaskar Trophy is level at 1-1.",KL Rahul dropped by Steve Smith on 33 on day four of the Brisbane Test.

NEW DELHI: After bowling out India for 260 in their first innings, the Aussies were looking for quick runs to set a target in the third Test of the ongoing Border-Gavaskar Trophy at The Gabba in Brisbane on Day 5.Australia were 28/4 when Steve Smith came to the crease.

NEW DELHI: Legendary Sunil Gavaskar voiced his anger over the shot selection of Shubman Gill in the first innings of the third Test in Brisbane on Monday. The former India captain urged Gill to ‘leave your image in the dressing room’ and put the fancy shots in his 'back pocket'.Gill chased a delivery outside off stump, playing it away from his body, resulting in an outside edge. Mitchell Marsh pulled off a brilliant catch at gully off Mitchell Starc's bowling.""Leave your image in the dressing room,"" Gavaskar said on Star Sports.""Certain shots are dangerous at the start of your innings before you are set, and you don't have the measure of what the wicket is doing. Keep all those shots in your back pocket. Take them out when you are 30-40-50 not out, then can you get those shots again,"" Gavaskar said.""Not very good shot selection, you could say. It was a very good catch, so there was a little bit of bad luck as well over there. But he could have left that ball alone; it would have gone harmlessly to the wicketkeeper,"" he further added.Gavaskar also urged Virat Kohli to take inspiration from Sachin Tendulkar 's iconic 241 against Australia in Sydney in 2004, advising him to avoid playing the cover drive to overcome his ongoing struggles with deliveries outside the off-stump.""He (Kohli) only needs to look at his hero, Sachin Tendulkar. The way in which he (Tendulkar) had kept his patience and control on his off-side game, scoring those 241 runs at Sydney,"" Gavaskar told Star Sports.Kohli suffered yet another failure as Josh Hazlewood dismissed him for 3, leaving a struggling India at 51 for 4 at stumps on Day 3, trailing by 394 runs.",Former India captain Sunil Gavaskar voiced his anger over the shot selection of Shubman Gill in the first innings of the third Test in Brisbane.

In the high-pressure crucible of the World Chess Championship , it wasn’t just the brilliance of D Gukesh ’s moves that left an indelible mark – it was his unwavering poise under tense situations that etched an unforgettable impression. The 18-year-old prodigy played not only with his mind but also with his heart, fighting every battle as though the board was a stage and he, the lead actor in a drama of unyielding resolve.Yet, it was his demeanour, as much as his daring, that caught the attention of those who observed him up close. Aleksandar Colovic, the Fair Play Officer of the blue-ribbon event tasked with ensuring the tournament’s integrity, noted that his job was made easier because of how well-behaved both Gukesh and former champion Ding Liren were.“They are very similar in many ways – both cultured and well-mannered. They both shook their legs when nervous, but in different ways. They were also very cooperative and kind. True gentlemen,” Aleksandar told TOI.In a world where chess geniuses often arrive wrapped in eccentricity, the Chennai teen has stood apart. Even in moments of extreme pressure, Gukesh maintained an aura of focus. Aleksandar, who observed every move with the precision of a hawk, quickly identified the quality that set Gukesh apart.“Actually, I was really impressed by Gukesh’s constant desire to put up a fight. I think Garry Kasparov or someone had said, ‘In a match between two players, the fighter always wins.’ Gukesh was the better fighter in this tournament. If you look at the games, when Ding was playing with the white pieces, he often avoided a fight. He wanted to be safe – wanted a draw.""But Gukesh wasn’t doing that. He took it to the extreme, avoiding a draw even in positions where he was objectively worse. This characteristic of being a true fighter, not shying away from a challenge, was the main difference that decided the champion,” said Aleksandar, a seasoned Fair Play Officer with extensive experience in events like the Grand Prix and the Candidates Tournament.After the victory, Gukesh praised his 32-year-old opponent, calling him a “true champion” and expressing his admiration. “I would also love to thank my opponent, Ding Liren. He is, in my eyes, a true champion, and we saw that despite a lot of pressure on him, he was able to put up a huge fight. I really admire you,” Gukesh said during the closing ceremony. This graciousness, especially at just 18, added to the impression of a young champion defined not only by his moves but also by his character.Meanwhile, Russian Chess Federation president Andrei Filatov has questioned the way Ding lost to Gukesh, calling for an investigation by FIDE . In response, Aleksandar remarked, “That blunder didn’t come out of nowhere. I mean, this was a long, gruelling game where Gukesh was pressing and pushing, while Ding just wanted the game to end. He was a few moves away, thinking nothing could go wrong, but then he messed up. After almost a month of constant pressure, people crack. That’s normal.”The officer’s role in the tournament was both challenging and rewarding, especially in an era where technology has blurred the lines of fair play. “Players were scanned before entering the play area, passing through different types of scanners to ensure they didn’t have any devices on them or their body. I also ensured no signals entered the glass cube. I really enjoyed it. I knew that maybe I’m becoming part of history here,” Aleksandar explained.","D Gukesh beat Ding Liren to win the World Chess Championship. The 18-year-old prodigy played not only with his mind but also with his heart. Aleksandar Colovic, the Fair Play Officer of the blue-ribbon event, noted that his job was made easier because of how well-behaved both players were.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116330003,imgsize-39352,width-400,resizemode-4/116330003.jpg"

India skipper Rohit Sharma 's struggle for runs has continued in Australia, and batting legend Sunil Gavaskar believes that Rohit may decide to step down as captain if runs continue to elude him in the last two matches of the Border Gavaskar Trophy (BGT) in Melbourne and Sydney.Speaking on ABC Sport, Gavaskar said Rohit won't leave it to the BCCI selectors to take that call.""I think Rohit obviously will get the opportunity to play in the next couple of matches, that's for sure. But maybe at the end of it, if he hasn't scored runs, my feeling is that he himself will take the call,"" said Gavaskar.Rohit has batted in the middle order so far in this series after joining the team from the second Test onwards and allowed KL Rahul to open as he had rediscovered his form at the top of the order.The skipper has been struggling ever since the Test series at home against New Zealand and Bangladesh before his arrival in Australia. Against Bangladesh, Rohit aggregated just 42 runs in four innings and against New Zealand 91 runs in six innings.In the ongoing BGT, his knocks so far read 3, 6, and 10.""He's a very conscientious cricketer, he will not want to be a burden on the team,"" Gavaskar continued. ""He's a cricketer who cares very deeply for Indian cricket . So if he doesn't score runs in the next couple of games, I think he himself will step down.""India's Test specialist Cheteshwar Pujara, who was part of the Indian team that won its last two series in Australia, said Rohit has put himself in self-doubt by not playing in position, i.e. an opener, where he is the most comfortable.""He has been opening the innings, now he's batting at number 6 (in Australia). That is for the team, but I still feel that when you are so much used to opening the innings and when you have to wait, then you put yourself in that doubt. I mean, it doesn't help you when you're opening the innings and you suddenly start batting at number 6,"" said Pujara while talking on Star Sports.",Sunil Gavaskar believes Rohit Sharma may step down as captain if runs continue to elude him in Australia.

Christmas came early to the Indian dressing room on Tuesday at the Gabba , which witnessed euphoric scenes minutes before close of play on day four of the third Test in Brisbane . India legends Virat Kohli , captain Rohit Sharma and chief coach Gautam Gambhir erupted in joy as soon as Akash Deep hit the boundary that ensured the visitors have saved the follow-on and potentially the third Test as well.An unbeaten 39-run partnership of 54 balls for the last wicket between Akash Deep (27*) and Jasprit Bumrah (10*) helped India go past the follow-on target of 246 to finish day four at 252 for 9. Although India still trail the home team's total of 445 by 193 runs, saving the follow-on has almost decisively moved the match towards a draw as Australia will have to bat now in their second innings on day five.But the scenes that went viral on Tuesday were of Kohli, Rohit and Gambhir doing the high fives and laughing heartily to watch Bumrah and Akash destroying Australia's hopes. The ninth wicket fell at the score of 213, when Jadeja was dismissed for a possibly match-saving knock of 77.The most important play of day four came in the last hour. At one stage where Australia were hoping that they could dismiss India, enforce the follow-on and bowl a few overs at the Indian openers before close of play, the visitors went to stumps with still a wicket in hand -- thanks to Bumrah, Akash and Jadeja.KL Rahul remains the top-scorer of India's first innings with his knock of 84.Both Bumrah and Akash showed exemplary display of copybook defence and game-awareness to milk the Australian bowlers with ones and twos and move closer to the follow-on target of 246. Once that was achieved, Akash showed his long-handle skills by hitting Pat Cummins for a six over mid-wicket.The shot brought Kohli on his feet as he ran right up to the glass window at the edge of the dressing room to see how far the ball travelled, while the rest of his teammates applauded with wide smiles on their faces.The importance of this match-saving act is such that it can potentially turn into a turning point in the series that will next move to Melbourne and then to Sydney for the concluding Test -- two venues that should favour the Indian batters more than Perth, Adelaide and Brisbane.","Akash Deep (27) and Jasprit Bumrah (10) help India go past the follow-on target of 246.

Virat Kohli during the net session.

BRISBANE: The sun was out in its full glory and it was a very hot morning in Brisbane before Day 4 got underway. The forecast apps had maintained consensus on rain but the morning didn't suggest that the day would be headed in that direction. As the handful of spectators made their way to The Gabba, there was a lot of noise coming from the nets area. Few Indian training jerseys were spotted from the main junction but the moment one got closer, the cast of the session was revealed.With the training tank top on, Virat Kohli was in the nets and faced a lot of deliveries from Harshit Rana, Prasidh Krishna, Washington Sundar and the throwdown specialists. The India batter kept switching nets for small hits against different attacks as he looked to iron out the flaws which have been leading to his downfalls in the ongoing Border-Gavaskar Trophy .In the first innings at Gabba, the right-hander was out nicking at a delivery well outside the off-stump and chatter of his vulnerabilities in that channel only grew louder. So, here he was, on the morning of the fourth day, sweating out as few spectators observed proceedings from a higher elevation and some were stationed right behind the net. Bowling coach Morne Morkel and assistant coach Ryan ten Doeschate were also present to assist Kohli, who also had Devdutt Padikkal batting in the adjacent net.There were drives, plenty of them, during the session and the former captain was comfortably shouldering arms to deliveries on length. Every time he would miscue the drive or shot, Kohli would speak to the throwdown specialist or the bowler and the interactions continued throughout his session.It will be safe to say that he looked assured and solid during that hit before the morning session got underway but the touch of the nets hasn't translated into match form during his recent outings. He scored a hundred in the second innings of the Perth Test but has been dismissed in single digits in three out of the four other innings in the series.There is still a lot of cricket left in the series and India's prolific batter would hope he gets his act right for the next two fixtures in Melbourne and Sydney. And even in the second innings in Brisbane, if weather permits.","Virat Kohli faced a lot of deliveries from Harshit Rana, Prasidh Krishna, Washington Sundar and the throwdown specialists.

MUMBAI: The Harris Shield final between Anjuman-I-Islam Allana School and Modern English, Chembur, at the Brabourne Stadium produced a thrilling match which resulted in the first-ever tie in the summit clash in the 128-year-old history of the tournament.However, a controversy broke out after the organisers, Mumbai Schools Sports Association (MSSA), declared Anjuman as the winners on the basis of their four-run first innings lead.In the first innings, Anjuman scored 267 while Modern English got 263 for eight in 80 overs. In the second innings, Anjuman were bowled out for 203 in 38.3 overs. In reply, Modern finished at 207 for six in 40 overs to tie the scores.The organisers' decision to declare Anjuman as the champions wasn't accepted by the umpires of the final and Modern English coach Subramanian Doraiswamy, a former Mumbai first-class player.The umpires Rupesh Khadgi and Ravindra Kolpe mentioned in the scoresheet (a copy is with TOI), ""The above-mentioned result has been declared by the organisers. We umpires are not accepting the above result as per the Mumbai Cricket Association Model Rule (PC). The final decision will be taken by theMCA committee ."" An upset Doraiswamy told this paper that Modern English will lodge a protest with the MSSA and the MCA. As per the rules, they have to register a protest in the next 48 hours.""We are protesting the final decision as according to the rule, it clearly says that the winner of the match in an 80 overs-a-side for the first innings and 40 overs-a-side for the second innings format, if the game ends in a tie, will be decided and awarded to the team with a better quotient. Even the umpires were of the same view,"" he said.However, MSSA cricket secretary Nadim Memon said, ""We went as per the rules of the first innings lead of four runs. The Harris Shield is run by the MSSA, so we took the decision as the match ended in a tie.""The MSSA and MCA officials and the umpires were present during the prize distribution ceremony.""During the prize distribution, former India skipper Dilip Vengsarkar was not pleased with the sight of as many as nine fielders on the boundary towards the closing stages of the match.The ex-national chief selector urged the organisers to change the rules in the final and make it compulsory for teams to have four fielders in the 30-yard circle. To encourage result-oriented finals, the MSSA, for the last three years, has restricted the second innings to 40 overs-a-side in the summit clash. However, that has resulted in teams tending to put defensive fields to restrict their opponents, rather than looking to dismiss them.""The Harris and Giles Shield (tournaments) hold a lot of importance in Mumbai cricket. Both the teams played well. However, in the second innings, which was 40 overs-a-side, I saw as many as nine fielders fielding on the boundary, when the equation was very close. From the next time, there must be (mandatorily) four fielders inside the 3 0-yard circle for all the 40 overs,"" Vengsarkar said.The 116-Test veteran also urged the boys to play conventional cricket in crunch situations. ""When the equation was four runs (needed) in two balls, that batsman could have played straight rather than reverse sweep. You could have won the match. Nevertheless, you guys will learn from this mistake. Don't be disappointed,"" Vengsarkar said.Anjuman 267 & 203 (Hamza Khan 57, Absurrahman Khan 37; Vivaan Jobanputra 4/80) bt Modern 263/8 & 207/6 (Kanav Saini 53, Rishabh Sadake 37, Devesh Birje 31; Yuvan Sharma 4/72) on first innings lead","Harris Shield final between Anjuman-I-Islam Allana School and Modern English, Chembur, ended in a tie.

India captain addresses form concerns after series of failures

BRISBANE: Apart from the top-order jitters, India have also been grappling with the poor form of their captain. On Wednesday, the skipper accepted for the first time that he had been struggling for runs. Rohit Sharma has scores of 3, 6 and 10 after having arrived late on this tour but more importantly, has looked uncomfortable adjusting to his new No. 6 role. Are his frustrations growing with each early dismissal?In what should come as good news for the team ahead of the Boxing Day Test in Melbourne, Rohit said he was satisfied with his preparations and feeling good mentally about his batting.""I've not batted well. There's no harm in accepting that, but I know what's in my mind, how I'm preparing myself,"" he said after the announcement of Ashwin's retirement. ""All those boxes are pretty much ticked. It's just about spending as much time as possible (in the middle). As long as my mind, my body and my feet are moving well, I'm happy with how things are panning out.""Sometimes, those numbers can tell you it's been a while since he's got big runs, but for a person like me, it's all about how I feel in my mind, what kind of prep I'm having before each game. I'm feeling good about myself, to be honest. The runs are obviously not showing that but inside it's a different feeling.""It's right that Rohit hasn't spent enough time in the middle to rediscover his rhythm, but his footwork has been an issue at times, with the normally fluent new-ball hitter struggling to adjust against the older, softer Kookaburra after conceding space to KL Rahul at the top. He is scintillating when in full flow and with the long gap between the third and fourth Tests, India will be hoping to see a different Rohit at the MCG","India captain Rohit Sharma has struggled for runs in recent Tests.

Retirement of star spinner makes Gabba draw incidental as rain has the final say

BRISBANE: In the end, a strange Test match marred by rain wound its way to a bizarre draw. Only 24.1 overs of play were possible on the last day as a major thunderstorm arrived.Lightning warnings flashed on the giant screens and players were forced off the dugouts. The long rain breaks meant all eyes were instead on the social media rumour mills, which correctly predicted the impending retirement of a senior India player, just that they couldn't settle on a name.All this while, some crazy proceedings played out in the middle, a brief glimpse of what could have been if India and Australia had got a full game here. The series is still tied 1-1 going into the final two Tests of the series, but India now need to win two out of two to make it to the World Test Championship final on their own steam.Luckily, they have Jasprit Bumrah , who took a match haul of 9/94 and along with Akash Deep and Siraj, ran through a kamikaze Aussie top order which went hard at everything. Even with the possibility of a result becoming increasingly remote, Pat Cummins ' men did not give up hope.Already 185 runs ahead, their batters were given the license to go after the Indian pacers, not the easiest of tasks in these conditions, on a pitch which appeared to have quickened, displayed variable bounce and had even developed some cracks.Australia threw their bats at everything, played Mitch Marsh ahead of Travis Head and Steve Smith and declared after collapsing to 89/7. That set India a 275-run target in a hypothetical 54 overs, but only 2.1 overs of play were possible before the game had to be called off. Eventually, the no-frills retirement of Ravichandran Ashwin overshadowed everything and truly set this Indian team on the path of transition. Everyone knew a retirement was coming, but no one knew whose. Ashwin was seen with Kohli in the dressing room, the two sharing a laugh, maybe a tear, definitely a hug. Which one would it be this time? A concerned-looking Nathan Lyon had a long chat with Ravindra Jadeja on the sidelines, then with Ashwin himself. Something was definitely up.Ending all the idle chatter, Rohit and Ashwin then sat awkwardly next to each other to announce the retirement and Ashwin hesitantly declared, ""I didn't want to make this about myself. It would have been better if Bumrah was here, or Akash Deep. Rohit is unfortunate to have me alongside.""Just like the proceedings in the middle, this was a perplexing farewell for one of India's biggest-ever cricketers. There was no guard of honour, no farewell ceremony. He wasn't even in the XI. Now, he leaves for home with two Tests left. The decision may have been a matter of honour. Maybe Ashwin was tired of the constant musical chairs. We can only speculate.As for the Test, India can claim the moral victory, having saved the follow-on to upset Australia's plans, but the fact remains that they were probably saved by the rain. Probably, because we'll never know. There were other positives. Akash Deep and Jasprit Bumrah's last-wicket heroics apart, KL Rahul and Ravindra Jadeja's fighting half-centuries will give the team hope. ""The thing that has been in our team now is that we don't give up easily, whatever the situation. We want to keep fighting,"" Rohit said. ""Even when we bowled (in the second innings), we had the same intensity because we knew they would play their shots. There's pressure on the other team too. Until you put some pressure on the other team, you won't know how they react under pressure.""That other team, meanwhile, saw its captain Pat Cummins resisting talk of needing to be fussed about the poor returns of some of his batters, including the openers. ""We're not beholden to stats. We know there are certain roles, there are easier times to bat, harder times to bat. You're always looking at the best seven that will function as a unit,"" Cummins said.",Only 24.1 overs of play were possible on the last day as a major thunderstorm arrived. The series is still tied 1-1 going into the final two Tests of the series. India now need to win two out of two to make it to the World Test Championship final.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116454870,imgsize-47906,width-400,resizemode-4/116454870.jpg"

R Ashwin announces retirement from Test cricket

NEW DELHI: James Foster , the former England wicketkeeper-batter, praised Indian off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin following his retirement from international cricket shortly after the Brisbane Test ended in a draw.The announcement came during the post-match press conference, where Ashwin appeared with Indian captain Rohit Sharma . The emotional moment was evident when Virat Kohli embraced him.""He's a world-class player. It's been a real joy actually. I don't know him personally, but a real joy sort of following his career and he's an ultimate competitor. I think that's an absolute given. But I think the thing that impresses me the most it's not just his skill level, but it's the way that his game has evolved as well over this long period of time. To play the amount of cricket that he's done and play at the top level like he's done for such a long period of time, you can't just do that through luck. It's a lot of hard work, a lot of smartness, and just the way he's evolved his game. It's been great to see where he has,"" James Foster told news agency ANI.Throughout his Test career spanning 106 matches, Ashwin accumulated 537 wickets, including 37 five-wicket hauls, and scored 3,503 runs. His position as the seventh-highest wicket-taker in Test cricket history and second-highest for India, following Anil Kumble's 619 wickets, solidifies his status.Ashwin's influence was particularly significant during India's ascent to the top of Test cricket between 2014 and 2019. His limited-overs career included 181 matches with 228 wickets. He participated in 116 ODIs, securing 156 wickets and scoring 707 runs, while in 65 T20Is, he claimed 72 wickets and contributed 184 runs.His total of 765 international wickets positions him as India's second-highest wicket-taker, behind Kumble's 953.

Novak Djokovic will run out of energy: Andre Agassi,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/top-stories/novak-djokovic-will-run-out-of-energy-andre-agassi/articleshow/116235405.cms,"American legend

Andre Agassi

believes Djokovic will miss Federer & Nadal, the guys he came to the dance with

Excerpts:

Djokovic's longevity:

Andy Murray coaching Djokovic:

Carlos Alcaraz

and longevity…

American men haven't had results like the women:

Graf was the hardest victory I ever had: Agassi

BENGALURU: Andre Agassi wondered if the 24-time major winner Novak Djokovic would miss his greatest rivals -- the now-retired Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer -- in the last leg of a glittering career where the 37-year-old goes for more history.The eight-time Grand Slam champion, in the city for the TiE Global Summit, assessed Djokovic's run and the Serb's recent partnership with friend and rival Andy Murray in a candid chat with media.It's hard to say, Father Time always wins. He has already done so much for so long, it's hard to imagine longer. We said that about (Roger) Federer too. I think Novak will run out of energy more than capability. Cannot be easy, especially when the people you came to the dance with have left, that's a big thing.When Pete (Sampras) retired it was a blow to me, it set me back a little bit. It made me rediscover my inspirations on some level. Djokovic has lost the guys he made history with. It'll probably get tougher and tougher emotionally, but I would never bet against them. Bet against them at your peril.In any coach-student relationship you need trust and trust can take time, but it's nice when it starts with believing in somebody because you know that they know your experience. There's an asset to their history as competitors.Any success of a relationship is based on complete buy-in and that's always the part you have to wait and see. It's not what I know that changes your career, information doesn't lead to transformation, somebody has to counter that. That's the connector. I'm sure there's going to be a lot of trust immediately, we'll see how the results go.Alcaraz defends like Novak, has more power and spin like Nadal, hands and finesse like Federer but just because he has the best of all the three doesn't mean he can do what they did. There are so many parts to the game such as decision-making, injuries, luck. So how long can (Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner) do it (for)? They could do it for 20 years or not.The women's game hasn't had to deal with Roger Federer, Novak Djokovic, Rafael, Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz, but they have their version of it. Serena Williams is the Novak of the women's game and you got Coco as a potential, like Alcaraz has potential and Sinner has potential.How the game evolves is interesting. The women's game has gotten very powerful, just straight power. For lack of a better example, Lindsay Davenport was powerful, tall, precise through the court and now you have a lot of that. There's still room for somebody who can offset that kind of power, like an Ash Barty.The men's game has changed in the sense that guys have gotten bigger with longer levers, which means they're better athletes, they can move and they need more time, they start playing further back. Soon you're going to start seeing the net game start coming back, everything morphs in its own way. But the biggest issue for American (men) not winning is an unfortunate set of decades where the guys were very stingy and very greedy -- 66 Grand Slams in the same generation. There's not a lot left there (for others)!Andre Agassi - the second of five men to achieve a career Grand Slam in the Open Era and the first man to complete a career golden slam - has won it all, including a stirring love match.""She was the hardest victory I ever had,"" said Agassi of his wife German tennis legend Steffi Graf, a 22-time major winner.Agassi, who has won eight major titles and the Olympic gold, speaking during a session at the TiE Global Summit, said, ""We all live a hero's journey - first part of life is about performing and achieving. Then life hits us with broken relationships and dreams. I went through it all. Finally, in the last phase of the journey, it's about serving others.""The 54-year-old said, ""At 28 my (tennis) career started over. Without the struggles, I would've never gotten Steffi to say yes. I tried to get her for years.""On a lighter note, Agassi said he likes to keep his trophies out of the house. ""I don't bring my trophies home, because if I bring my trophies home, then she brings her trophies home - and that's bad math!""",Andre Agassi believes Novak Djokovic will run out of energy more than capability. The eight-time Grand Slam champion is in the city for the TiE Global Summit.

NEW DELHI: Legendary player Andre Agassi observed that Carlos Alcaraz embodies distinct qualities from Novak Djokovic Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal , while advising the tennis world against anticipating the young Spaniard to match the extraordinary achievements of these tennis legends.The collective Grand Slam victories of Federer, Nadal and Djokovic stand at 66, whilst Alcaraz, aged 21, has secured four major titles thus far.""I'm not a genius and I don't have a crystal ball. What I can tell you is Alcaraz defends like Novak, has power and spin like Nadal and has hands and finesse like Federer,"" said Agassi during a talk session in Bengaluru.The eight-time Grand Slam victor Agassi elaborated on why excessive expectations shouldn't burden Alcaraz.""Just because he has the best of all those three doesn't mean he can do what they did because there're so many other parts to the game, which mean decision-making, injuries, you know, luck,"" he said.With Djokovic at 37, approaching retirement, Agassi noted that the Serbian's competitive edge might diminish without Nadal and Federer in the arena.""He's already done so much, so long, and it's hard to imagine longer. I think he'll run out of the energy for it more than the capability of it, I would imagine.""It cannot be easy, especially when the people you came to the dance with have left.""The American provided additional context to his assessment.""When Pete (Sampras) retired, it was a blow to me. It set me back a little bit. It made me have to rediscover my inspirations on some level.""And he's (Djokovic) lost the guys that he's made history with. So, it's probably emotionally going to get tougher and tougher quickly, but I would never bet against him. Bet against him at your own peril,"" said Agassi.Regarding Djokovic's recent appointment of Andy Murray as coach to extend his career, Agassi expressed interest in their partnership's development.""They've been fierce rivals on court, and now Murray will be coaching Djokovic. Well, in any coaching student relationship, you need trust. Trust can take time.""I think there's an asset to their history as competitors, but any success of a relationship is based on complete buy-in.""",Andre Agassi says Carlos Alcaraz embodies distinct qualities from Novak Djokovic Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal.

NEW DELHI: Tennis icon Andre Agassi on Tuesday highlighted how sports should remain integral to education, noting their role in teaching children to cope with defeat.At a Bengaluru event focussed on sports and education's role in fostering excellence, Agassi shared his insights.""Even when you have a failure, you have to get up and play again the next day. So, what sports is teaching you is that focusing on winning and losing is really a distraction from what we need to be thinking about. We need to be thinking about how to get better,"" he said.Since 2001, Agassi has invested in education for underprivileged children, establishing 130 schools serving approximately 80,000 students in the United States. He attributes this achievement to his persistent drive to overcome obstacles.His demanding tennis career shaped his ability to maintain focus and adapt when necessary.""Sports is all about problem-solving. Tennis taught me how to navigate a very intense environment and maintain my objectivity and problem-solving abilities. It forces me to be present, but also to understand the context of what I'm doing,"" Agassi said.Regarding his earlier defiant period, Agassi acknowledged it as a necessary phase in his journey.""Vulnerability is essential for growth, and I think vulnerability eventually leads to humility,"" he added.He recognised technology's crucial role in education, particularly in providing individualised learning opportunities for children. This belief influenced his investment in the Indian EdTech company, Square Panda .""I think technology can play an essential role, not just in scalability, but also in optimising personalised learning. That's why I got involved with Square Panda. We are here because of the sheer scale of impact the technology will bring to education,"" he said.","Tennis icon Andre Agassi highlighted how sports should remain integral to education.

'The injustice to me was painful': Simona Halep slams ITIA's double standards after Iga Swiatek's one-month ban,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/top-stories/the-injustice-to-me-was-painful-simona-halep-slams-itias-double-standards-after-iga-swiateks-one-month-ban/articleshow/115815329.cms,"Iga Swiatek and Simona Halep (Agency Photos)

NEW DELHI: Former world number one tennis player from Romania Simona Halep has raised concerns about the perceived discrepancies in the treatment of cases involving positive tests for banned substances by the International Tennis Integrity Agency ( ITIA ).Her criticism stems from the recent one-month ban imposed on Iga Swiatek , the current world number two, after testing positive for the heart medication trimetazidine (TMZ) in an out-of-competition sample.Halep, who returned to tennis in March 2023 after serving a provisional suspension since October 2022 for testing positive for roxadustat at the US Open, believes there is a lack of consistency in the ITIA's approach.She questions the significant difference in the penalties handed out to her and Swiatek, despite the cases occurring around the same time.In her statement, Halep expressed her bewilderment at the disparate treatment and questioned the logical reasoning behind the ITIA's decisions. She accused the organization of attempting to ""destroy"" her career, despite the evidence presented, and claimed to have suffered from the perceived injustice.“I have always believed in good, I have believed in the fairness of this sport, I have believed in kindness,"" Halep wrote on Instagram. “The injustice that was done to me was painful, is painful and maybe will always be painful. How is it possible that in identical cases that happened at about the same time (of the season), ITIA has completely different approaches, to my detriment?”Halep had initially received a four-year ban from the ITIA, which she successfully appealed at the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) in February 2023. The CAS ruled that her positive test for roxadustat, a banned blood doping agent, was the result of a contaminated supplement.Her experience has raised concerns about the fairness and impartiality of the disciplinary process within the tennis governing bodies.",Former world number one tennis player Simona Halep has raised concerns about the perceived discrepancies in the treatment of positive tests by the ITIA.

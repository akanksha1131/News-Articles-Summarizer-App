India vs New Zealand ODIs preview: Captain Shubman Gill, vice-captain Shreyas Iyer in focus





Few figures in Indian women’s cricket are as familiar with winning trophies as Harmanpreet Kaur . She has led the Mumbai Indians to two Women’s Premier League titles and captained India to their historic maiden Women’s ODI World Cup crown last year.After steering Mumbai Indians to another title-winning run in the previous WPL edition, the seasoned campaigner is ready to lead the most successful side in the competition once again as they face Royal Challengers Bengaluru in a blockbuster opening clash of WPL 4 on Friday night.“Whenever I go on the field, I tell my team that I want to win the trophy,” Harmanpreet said during the Mumbai Indians’ pre-season press conference in Mumbai on Wednesday. “This new year starts with the WPL and I have the same energy and excitement going into the tournament. We have the same mindset. We have won two trophies in the last three seasons, and we want to play well this season and win the trophy again.”Over time, Harmanpreet has developed a deep connection with Mumbai, a city that has witnessed her lift three titles in the past three years. “Mumbai has always been special to me. It’s a special city and I’ve had a lot of positive results here.This season is going to be very special, hopefully. Our mindset will remain the same, which is to win the WPL again. I am really happy that last season and last year turned out to be very good overall for women’s cricket, and I hope this year also starts the same way,” she said.Reflecting on the growth of the women’s game, Harmanpreet added, “Four or five years ago, there was a group of just 20 to 25 players, but now there is a much larger pool. We are happy to have more talent around.”Mumbai Indians mentor and bowling coach Jhulan Goswami also praised the setup at the franchise. “It’s a blessing to work here. There is so much experience within the group and we can learn a lot under this leadership. At MI, we believe women should always come forward, and having an all-female coaching team is a great thing for us,” Goswami said.Harmanpreet believes the intense competition in the WPL plays a key role in preparing players for the international stage. “The competition in the WPL is very high and you play quality cricket. When you perform well there, you face the same players at the international level. Those performances stay in everyone’s mind, and that helps you do well in international cricket too,” she said.She also stressed that consistent match exposure is vital for confidence. “The more cricket you play, the more your confidence grows. Earlier, players didn’t get as many matches as they do now. Many girls would come into the Indian team without much experience. Playing more cricket and competing on different platforms really helps build confidence,” Harmanpreet added.",Harmanpreet Kaur has led the Mumbai Indians to two Women’s Premier League titles.

India can survive without Virat and Rohit, not without Bumrah





BENGALURU: Eleven months is a long time — even longer in sport. It was a period that nearly derailed young all-rounder Shreyanka Patil’s career.Rehabilitation replaced matchdays, and recovery milestones mattered more than wickets. Yet the prolonged time away from the field also brought with it important life lessons.Having missed key moments with both the Indian team and Royal Challengers Bengaluru, Shreyanka is set to return in RCB colours this week as the Women’s Premier League (WPL) season gets underway.The 23-year-old opened up about the grind behind her comeback and the lessons the injury taught her during a virtual media interaction on Wednesday.“I thought it was just a one-off injury and I’d be back in a couple of months. I never imagined I would be away from the field for more than a year,” Shreyanka said. “Missing out on the WPL was a big blow, and then missing the World Cup hurt me a lot.”The injury, however, allowed the Karnataka player to interact with several cricketers, including Jasprit Bumrah and Suryakumar Yadav. Shreyanka recalled picking Bumrah’s brains on the sidelines of a session at the Centre of Excellence (CoE).Shreyanka found an unlikely source of strength in Bumrah’s words, drawn from his own battles with time away from the game. His advice on patience, trusting the process, and not rushing the body helped her navigate the toughest phase of recovery.“He told me, ‘It’s okay — what you’re going through, everyone will go through. You’re facing this at a very young age. Don’t fight it — just be in it,” Shreyanka said. “That was lovely advice, because he’s also gone through a lot.”Shreyanka returned to the field after 11 months last September, turning out for the Barbados Royals in the Women’s Caribbean Premier League. She described the moment as a fresh beginning.“I was excited. When I bowled the first ball, I said, ‘I’m fine now.’ All my nerves eased down,” she recalled.Shreyanka also spoke about her reaction to being retained by RCB. “I was at a loss for words. I was shocked because they placed their trust in someone who hadn’t played for almost a year,” she said.Although RCB will play all their matches away from their home ground, the M Chinnaswamy Stadium, this season, Shreyanka believes fan support will remain unwavering. “Wherever we go, we have our fans,” she signed off.RCB will take on the Mumbai Indians in the tournament opener on Jan 9 in Mumbai.",Shreyanka Patil is set to return to action for Royal Challengers Bengaluru this week. The 23-year-old had been out of action for 11 months with an injury.

Bangladesh seek T20 WC match shift from India after Mustafizur Rahman's IPL exit





Vaibhav Sooryavanshi continued his sensational form with a stunning century, while Aaron George also reached triple figures as India U-19 crushed South Africa by 233 runs in the third and final youth ODI, completing a commanding 3-0 series sweep on Wednesday. Sooryavanshi’s brilliance earned him both the Player of the Match and Player of the Series awards.Sent in to bat, captain Sooryavanshi, who had blitzed a 24-ball 68 in the previous match, was once again in destructive mood. The 14-year-old from Bihar smashed 127 off just 74 balls, belting ten sixes and nine fours, showcasing his fearless strokeplay.Opening partner Aaron George backed him up superbly, crafting 118 off 106 deliveries. Together, the duo put on a massive 227-run partnership that set the tone for India’s imposing total of 393 for 7.South Africa’s chase never got off the ground, as they were bowled out for 160 in 35 overs. Ntando Soni (3/61) and Jason Rowles (2/59) led the bowling effort for India at Willowmoore Park, sharing five wickets between them.Chasing a steep target, South Africa stumbled early, losing three wickets for just 15 runs in the fourth over.Kishan Singh wreaked havoc at the top, dismissing Jorich Van Schalkwyk (1), Adnaan Lagadien (9), and Lethabo Phahlamohlaka (0). The 19-year-old Singh, who had already taken four wickets in the second ODI, was once again the standout bowler.A brief fightback from Daniel Bosman (40) and Jason Rowles (19) proved insufficient, as South Africa slid to 99 for six in the 23rd over. Late resistance from Paul James (41) and Corne Botha (36 not out) only delayed the inevitable.Sooryavanshi’s third Youth ODI century further cemented his rising reputation. In 18 matches, he has scored 973 runs at an average of 54.05 with a strike rate of 164.08, including three centuries and four fifties. India had already secured the series with a 25-run DLS win in the opener and an eight-wicket victory in the second ODI, making this final triumph a fitting conclusion to a dominant campaign.","India U-19 crush South Africa by 233 runs in third and final youth ODI.

India ODI squad review | Iyer returns, Pant gets the nod, Shami misses out again

Making debut in 1971

An in-born leader

A quiet goodbye





NEW DELHI: On this day, cricket pauses to remember a farewell that meant far more than just the end of a career. It was the day Imran Khan , Pakistan’s greatest cricketer and one of the finest all-rounders the game has seen, walked away from Test cricket.Even now, in 2026, that moment still carries a quiet weight and a deep sense of pride for cricket fans around the world.Imran’s retirement was not simply about one player calling it a day. It felt like the final page of a story that shaped Pakistan cricket itself. For more than 20 years, he was the team’s heartbeat, and when he wore the whites one last time, it was clear an era had truly ended.Imran made his Test debut in 1971 at a time when Pakistan cricket was still somewhere finding its feet on the world stage.Reflecting aura of his tall stature, the Lahore-born was young and full of raw talent. When he lacked in experience, he made up for with hunger.Over the years, that young fast bowler transformed into a world-class cricketer, somewhat echoing the growth of overall Pakistan cricket.With the ball, he was fast, fierce, and intelligent. He could swing the ball both ways and extract bounce even on dead pitches.Batters never felt comfortable facing him, whether they were playing in Karachi, Lord’s, or the Caribbean.With the bat, he was dependable. Whenever Pakistan was in trouble, Imran often stood tall. In simple terms, Imran Khan could do it all.But what truly set Imran apart was his leadership.When he took over as captain, Pakistan became a different team.He believed Pakistan could compete with the best, and slowly, that belief spread through the dressing room.He backed young players, gave them confidence, and taught them to play fearless cricket.Many legends of Pakistan cricket later admitted that they became better players because Imran trusted them when no one else did.The day Imran Khan retired from Test cricket was filled with mixed emotions.There was pride in what he had achieved and also sadness that fans would no longer see him leading Pakistan in the longest format of the game.He finished his Test career with more than 3,800 runs and 360 wickets.This was a time before modern helmets, fitness coaches, and sports science. Imran Khan relied on sheer will, pushing his body to its limits whenever his team needed him. Injuries were part of the journey, but his dedication never wavered.Even when his body began to slow, his cricketing brain stayed sharp as he would read the game better than those around him.As captain, he transformed Pakistan into a team that could win away from hom.Famous series wins and strong performances overseas earned Pakistan genuine respect, and teams around the world stopped underestimating them, largely because of Imran Khan’s leadership and vision.When Imran finally bid adieu to Test cricket, he did so with dignity.There were no dramatic speeches or emotional displays. That was never his style.Interestingly, Imran’s retirement from Test cricket did not mark the end of his influence. Not long after he stepped away from Test cricket, Imran Khan gave Pakistan one of its greatest sporting moments by leading the team to World Cup glory in 1992.It felt like a final reward for a nation that had watched him give everything in whites for years, even though his Test career had already made him a legend.Looking back at his Test farewell in 2026, the meaning of that moment still stands out.Imran’s journey shows that greatness is built slowly, through effort and belief, and that the best leaders leave behind stronger teams.For fans, he will always be the cricketer who taught Pakistan to dream big.","Imran Khan made his Test debut in 1971 at a time when Pakistan cricket was still somewhere finding its feet on the world stage.

Bangladesh seek T20 WC match shift from India after Mustafizur Rahman's IPL exit





NEW DELHI: Former India opener Shikhar Dhawan has strongly spoken out against recent attacks on the minority Hindus in Bangladesh. He shared his feelings on social media after reports emerged about a Hindu widow being brutally assaulted. Dhawan said such acts of violence are wrong and should never be accepted.Posting on his social media account X (formerly Twitter), Dhawan wrote: “Heartbreaking to read about the brutal assault on a Hindu widow in Bangladesh. Such violence against anyone, anywhere is unacceptable. Prayers for justice and support for the survivor.”Over the past few months, there have been several incidents of violence against Hindus in Bangladesh.Since December, reports say that men from minority communities have been killed. The situation has badly affected cricket relations between India and Bangladesh.After public backlashes, the BCCI asked Kolkata Knight Riders to release Bangladesh fast bowler Mustafizur Rahman from their IPL 2026 squad.The Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) demanded that their four T20 World Cup matches in India be shifted to Sri Lanka, citing safety concerns.On Wednesday, the BCB confirmed that the International Cricket Council (ICC) has stepped in to ensure Bangladesh’s participation in the T20 World Cup is not disrupted. The tournament is scheduled to begin on February 7.The BCB said the ICC has replied to their concerns and is ready to work closely with them on security matters.“The Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) has received a response from the International Cricket Council (ICC) regarding the Board’s expressed concerns over the safety and security of the Bangladesh National Cricket Team in India for the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup 2026, including the request for relocation of the team’s matches,” the BCB said in their statement.The board added that the ICC wants Bangladesh to take part fully in the tournament.“In its communication, the ICC has reiterated its commitment to ensuring the full and uninterrupted participation of the Bangladesh team in the tournament. The ICC has conveyed its willingness to work closely with the BCB to address the concerns raised and has assured that the Board’s inputs will be welcomed and duly considered as part of the detailed security planning for the event.“The BCB has also taken note of certain reports published in a section of the media suggesting that the Board has been issued an ultimatum in this regard. The BCB categorically states that such claims are completely false, unfounded and do not reflect the nature or content of the communication received from the ICC.“The Board will continue constructive engagement with the ICC and relevant event authorities in a cooperative and professional manner to arrive at an affable and practical solution that ensures the smooth and successful participation of the team in the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup 2026. The Bangladesh Cricket Board remains firmly committed to placing the highest priority on the safety, security and well-being of the Bangladesh National Cricket Team,” the statement read.","Shikhar Dhawan speaks out against recent attacks on the minority Hindus in Bangladesh.

Bangladesh seek T20 WC match shift from India after Mustafizur Rahman's IPL exit





Bangladesh’s Youth and Sports Adviser Asif Nazrul has openly questioned whether the International Cricket Council is fully grasping the gravity of the situation surrounding the national team’s participation in the 2026 T20 World Cup matches scheduled in India.Speaking to the media on Wednesday after a meeting with Bangladesh Cricket Board president Aminul Islam Bulbul and vice-president Faruque Ahmed, Asif Nazrul said the response received from the ICC failed to reflect the seriousness of the security concerns raised by Bangladesh.The issue escalated after fast bowler Mustafizur Rahman was released by Kolkata Knight Riders ahead of the next IPL season, following advice from the BCCI. Soon after, the BCB formally asked the ICC to move Bangladesh’s T20 World Cup fixtures from India to co-host Sri Lanka.“After reading the letter we received from the ICC today, we felt that they have not fully understood the serious security situation that has developed in India for Bangladeshi cricketers,” Asif Nazrul said. “To me, it does not feel like only a security issue. It feels like an issue of national humiliation as well. Still, we are primarily treating it as a security issue.”Asif Nazrul said discussions with the BCB leadership led to a unanimous view that Bangladesh’s qualification for the World Cup came through hard work and deserved respect.“We are a cricket-crazy nation and we definitely want to play. We do not want to play the T20 World Cup at the cost of national humiliation, at the cost of the security of our cricketers, spectators and journalists, or at the cost of the country’s dignity. ”Reiterating Bangladesh’s position, Asif Nazrul made it clear that the request to shift matches was non-negotiable. “When it comes to the security of our cricketers, the security of Bangladesh, and the honour and dignity of Bangladesh, there will be no compromise. We want to play the T20 World Cup and since there is another host country, Sri Lanka, we want to play there. We are firm on this position.”The adviser also pointed to the Mustafizur episode as evidence of a wider problem. “When the Indian cricket board itself is telling the Kolkata team that they cannot provide security to this player and asking them to drop him from the team, that alone shows there is no environment in India where it is safe to play.”On the possibility of the ICC rejecting the request, Asif Nazrul said the immediate focus was persuasion. “Our first stand is to convince the ICC. We have strong arguments and we will convince them with those arguments. On the question of Bangladesh’s security, honour and dignity, there will be no compromise.”","Bangladesh's Youth and Sports Adviser Asif Nazrul has openly questioned whether the International Cricket Council is fully grasping the gravity of the situation.

BUENOS AIRES: Lionel Messi would prefer to become a club owner rather than a coach when he quits as a player, the Argentina football star has said.In October, he signed a three-year contract extension with Inter Miami to take him through the 2028 season.“I don’t see myself as a coach,” the 38-year-old Messi told the Luzu TV streaming channel in an interview recorded in December that aired Tuesday. “I like management, but if have to decide for one of the three I would like to be an owner.“I would like to have my own club, to be able to grow it, to start from the bottom and to be able to give the kids, the people, the opportunity to grow and make it an important club. If I had to choose, that’s what would appeal to me most.”Messi, who led Argentina to the World Cup title in Qatar in 2022, is already a part owner of Uruguay’s fourth-division team Deportivo LSM, which is co-owned by Inter teammate Luis Suarez.“Deportivo LS is a family dream that began in 2018. We have grown a lot with more than 3,000 members,” club founder Suarez said last May in a video alongside Messi. “I want to offer Uruguayan football, the place I love and where I grew up as a child, opportunities and tools for teenagers and children to grow.”The eight-time Ballon d’Or winner Messi also has a future minority ownership stake in Inter included in his contract.Messi won the MLS Golden Boot this season after scoring 29 goals, five more than LAFC’s Denis Bouanga and Nashville’s Sam Surridge. He also had 19 assists, and his 48 total goal contributions was one shy of matching the league record set by Carlos Vela in 2019.Messi also became the became the first player to win back-to-back MVP awards in MLS history.","Lionel Messi would prefer to become a club owner rather than a coach when he quits as a player, the Argentina football star has said. “I would like to have my own club, to be able to grow it, to start from the bottom and to give the kids, the people, the opportunity to grow and make it an important club,” the 38-year-old Messi said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126399576,imgsize-54870,width-400,resizemode-4/lionel-messi-visits-india.jpg"

Jay Shah’s 2036 Olympic blueprint for India: '8 Medals won’t cut it'





New Delhi: Bengaluru FC owner Parth Jindal on Wednesday called on the players to ""make sacrifices"" in view of the ""financial burden"" the club will shoulder to participate in the delayed Indian Super League (ISL) next month, saying without their support, the club may have to ""shut shop for good"".All India Football Federation's (AIFF) bid to rope in a new commercial partner did not find any takers after the Master Rights Agreement (MRA) with the ISL organisers, the Reliance-owned FSDL, ended on December 8 last year.Though Sports Minister Mansukh Mandaviya on Tuesday announced that the delayed and truncated 2025-26 ISL season will begin on February 14 with all the 14 clubs participating in it, the franchises will struggle financially if the top-tier tournament does not get a commercial partner soon.The AIFF is expected to float another tender soon for a commercial partner.Jindal did not specifically explain the kind of sacrifice the footballers will be expected to make, but it could well be a reduced salary for this season. The club features, among others, former India captain Sunil Chhetri and star goalkeeper Gurpreet Singh Sandhu.The ISL clubs are required to share 60 per cent of the financial cost (around Rs one crore per club) for the league to start after a nearly six months long pause.The total cost for the upcoming season has been pegged at Rs 25 crore by the AIFF.""Tremendous sacrifice from all clubs is being asked for to play the ISL in its current format. Repercussions if we don't have a league are very worrying,"" Jindal wrote on 'X'.""Truly hope the players understand the additional financial burden on the clubs and agree to also sacrifice as we are all in this together. We are in this for the love of football and to see our country play the beautiful game and be good at it.""He admitted that Bengaluru FC has been a loss-making franchise since joining the ISL and said the club may have to wind up its operations if players do not cooperate.""@bengalurufc football has been a loss making proposition for all since I can remember - this year's numbers without the players helping out will force many to shut shop for good,"" he said in the tweet which was reposted by FC Goa CEO Ravi Puskur.Jindal also thanked Mandaviya ""for his intervention and his proposal"", which led to the ending of a crisis that paralysed Indian football.Earlier on Friday, leading names such as Sunil Chhetri, along with several foreign recruits of the ISL, had called for world governing body FIFA's intervention to rescue the ISL.Chhetri, Gurpreet Singh Sandhu and Sandhesh Jhingan voiced concern over the prolonged uncertainty, warning that Indian football would be slipping into a state of ""permanent paralysis"".On Tuesday, Mandaviya announced that the ISL will have 91 matches on home and away basis, the logistics of which are still being worked out.AIFF President Kalyan Chaubey, who took over the explaining part after the Minister's announcement, said a Rs 25 crore central pool has been made for only the conduct of the ISL.""Ten percent of this fund will come from AIFF, 30 percent was to come from a commercial partner but since we don't have one right now, the AIFF will pitch in with that contribution,"" Chaubey had said.""In all, the AIFF will give Rs 14 crore for ISL and about Rs 3.2 crore for I League till we find a commercial partner. The rest of the fund will come through the legacy participating clubs. Hopefully we will find a commercial partner soon,"" he added.""In case, we face any difficulty, the government will also step in to assist us,"" he stated.A tender was floated for the selection of a commercial rights partner last year under the supervision of a Supreme Court-appointed committee, but much to AIFF's embarrassment, there were no takers for it.

Jay Shah’s 2036 Olympic blueprint for India: '8 Medals won’t cut it'

Poll Do you agree with the decision to change the ISL format to a single leg home and away structure? Yes, it's a good change. No, I preferred the previous format. Undecided.





PANAJI: The sports ministry and the All India Football Federation (AIFF) turned the tables on top-tier clubs during a joint meeting in the Capital on Tuesday, leaving them with no choice but agree to take part in this edition of the Indian Super League (ISL).Sports minister Mansukh Mandaviya later announced that the ISL will kick off on Feb 14 with all 14 teams taking part. When clubs headed to the Capital at short notice — summoned individually through a phone call late on Monday night by AIFF deputy secretary general M Satyanarayan — they were expecting to hear the proposal, return home, study and then consult owners. Instead, they were told time was running out and they had to say “yes or no” on Tuesday itself.“We had no choice to decide whether the (short-term) proposal makes sense,” said one club official who had to hurriedly call the club owner and inform him of the latest developments.Consistent in their stand that they are taking part in the top league, whatever the format and financial implications, Jamshedpur FC were the first to provide an email confirmation, followed by the likes of Punjab FC, East Bengal, NorthEast United, Mohammedan Sporting and Inter Kashi.Later, Delhi SC, Bengaluru FC and Mohun Bagan Super Giant came on board. Five clubs — Kerala Blasters, Chennaiyin FC, Mumbai City, FC Goa and Odisha FC — needed time to speak with their owners and reluctantly agreed. ISL clubs were also taken aback with the change in format.While most were in favour of a single-leg centralised format, AIFF proposed a single leg home and away structure for the current season, estimated to cost Rs24.3 crore. AIFF said a single leg centralised format will cost Rs 38 crore, adding to the cost.The ISL will have a total of 91 matches with all 14 teams playing each other once. Clubs have to pay Rs 1 crore each as franchise fee. As per the constitution, the top league will have principles of promotion and relegation, but AIFF is likely to approach the Supreme Court for a one-year relaxation, given that it will be a truncated league. Talking to the media, sports minister Mansukh Mandaviya said: “Today the govt, football federation and 14 clubs had a meeting and we have decided that ISL will start Feb 14 on Saturday. All 14 clubs will participate.”“Similarly, the I-League will be held around the same time with all 11 clubs participating. The leagues will finally happen,” he added.Mandaviya was joined by the beleaguered AIFF president Kalyan Chaubey, who explained the financial and logistical aspects of both leagues. “A Rs 25 crore central pool has been made only for the conduct of the ISL. 10 percent of this fund will come from AIFF, 50% from clubs and 10% from legacy partners (clubs). Another 30% was to come from a commercial partner but since we don’t have one right now, the AIFF will pitch in with that contribution for this season,” Chaubey said.",The Indian Super League (ISL) will start on February 14. All 14 teams will take part. The ISL will have a total of 91 matches with all 14 teams playing each other once. Clubs have to pay Rs 1 crore each as franchise fee.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126386994,imgsize-52494,width-400,resizemode-4/indian-super-league-trophy.jpg"

Usman Khawaja's retirement speech: 'I want the journey for the next Usman Khawaja to be easier'

- Full-time job? -





LONDON: Manchester United interim boss Darren Fletcher said Tuesday that leading the club was beyond his ""wildest dreams"" but insisted he has not considered replacing the sacked Ruben Amorim. The Portuguese manager was axed on Monday after a turbulent 14 months at Old Trafford, with former United midfielder Fletcher put in temporary charge.The under-18s coach faced the press for the first time on the eve of his team's match at Burnley.""It's surreal,"" said Fletcher, who made 342 appearances for the Red Devils and has worked in a variety of different roles for them since 2020, including as technical director.""It's an amazing honour to be able to lead a Manchester United team,"" he said. ""I don't even think it was in my wildest dreams that that was something that could potentially happen, even thinking about playing for the club and stuff like that.""But to lead out the team is an amazing honour and something I am really proud to do.""It's not (happened) in the circumstances that I expected it to happen so that obviously is something that doesn't sit quite easy with me, but I just have to think I've got a job to do and I've got to lead the team tomorrow and think of the great honour and pride in doing that.""The former Scotland international is expected to remain in place until the club appoints a caretaker boss, with United planning to name Amorim's permanent successor at the end of the season.The BBC reported that the club had held preliminary talks with Fletcher, Michael Carrick and former boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, all ex-United players, about the position of caretaker.But Fletcher, 41, said at his pre-match press conference that conversations with United's hierarchy had focused on Wednesday's game and they would talk again after the match.Fletcher was asked whether he wanted to try to earn the manager's job on a full-time basis.""Honestly it's not something I've thought about,"" he said. ""I'm focusing on Burnley. I think that discussion is for after the game.""There has been that much going on and it has all happened so quickly that all my concentration, efforts and thoughts have gone into Burnley.""Fletcher won five Premier League titles under the management of Alex Ferguson but the club have not been English champions since 2013.""Everyone expects Manchester United to be on the top and winning, that's the standard, that's what we all have to try and achieve,"" said a bullish Fletcher.He was asked what his United team would look like.""Hopefully it looks like a Manchester United team that represents a bit of me, I think in terms of what I know is Manchester United,"" he said.""So I hope it resembles a Manchester United team that fans can be proud of, that I can be proud of, and I'm sure they will because I believe in the players.""I think we've got good players and I think we've got players who care and I think we've got a lot of quality in that team and I hope to give them a platform to go out there to express themselves.""Fletcher said he hoped to welcome back captain Bruno Fernandes and Mason Mount into a squad badly depleted by injuries and international commitments.He joked that he refused to disclose sensitive information when asked whether his twin sons, Jack and Tyler, would be given full debuts against Burnley.United are sixth in the Premier League table, three points behind fourth-placed Liverpool.","Darren Fletcher says leading Manchester United is beyond his ""wildest dreams"" Fletcher is in temporary charge after the sacking of Ruben Amorim on Monday. The 41-year-old says he has not considered a full-time role at Old Trafford.

Chelsea have confirmed Liam Rosenior as their new manager, signing the 41-year-old on a six-year contract until 2032 after he left French side Strasbourg on Tuesday. Rosenior, known for his attack-minded approach, becomes only the second Black manager in Chelsea’s history, following Ruud Gullit.Rosenior earned praise for transforming Strasbourg into a competitive Ligue 1 side, guiding them to a seventh-place finish last season and European qualification. “Liam has shown that he can build teams with a clear way of playing while setting the highest standards with players on and off the pitch. While there will continue to be a focus on player development, the club’s expectations and ambitions remain high,” Chelsea said in their announcement.Before Strasbourg, Rosenior had a stint as assistant coach at Derby under Wayne Rooney, who commended his “incredible” work ethic and attention to detail. Despite his success in France, Rosenior has never managed a Premier League side. He succeeds Enzo Maresca, who left after 18 months at the helm.Chelsea, currently fifth in the league and 17 points behind leaders Arsenal, offer Rosenior a higher-profile and more pressurised stage.Reflecting on the opportunity, Rosenior said: “I am excited to work with this extremely talented group of players and staff, to build strong connections on and off the pitch, and to create an environment where everyone feels united and driven by the same goal.”The move also carries personal significance. Rosenior added: “This opportunity for me is something I can’t turn down at this moment in my life… It means that I can go home and see my kids. I’m away from my children, I missed them. And I wanted to make the sacrifice of not seeing them worth it, with the success that we have here.”Son of former player and coach Leroy Rosenior, Liam had a 16-year professional playing career in England, representing Fulham, Reading, Hull, Brighton, and England Under-21s. He returned to Hull as his first head coach in 2022 before joining Strasbourg in 2024, leaving the French club with European football secured and a spot in the knockout phase of the UEFA Conference League.Rosenior defended his decision to move to Chelsea, stating: “I don’t think anyone can question how hard I’ve worked for the club, my integrity in the way I’ve worked for this club. I don’t think anyone can question the decision I’ve made to move on with my career.”This appointment marks a rare top-level opportunity for a Black British coach in the Premier League, and Chelsea will hope Rosenior can bring stability and consistency to a side that has seen five permanent managers since the BlueCo takeover in 2022.","Chelsea appoint Liam Rosenior as their new manager.

MANCHESTER: Ruben Amorim's sacking by Manchester United has exposed the dismal lack of progress since Jim Ratcliffe's arrival as co-owner promised a new dawn.Amorim was the latest manager unable to turn the tide at Old Trafford, which has witnessed more than a decade of decline since Alex Ferguson retired in 2013.The veteran Scot stood down after winning the club's 20th English league crown following two decades of domestic dominance gilded by European success.Since then United have not seriously competed to win the Premier League or Champions League despite a succession of big-name managers.Amorim, 40, is the first boss to be hired and axed since Ratcliffe took control of the club's football operations after acquiring a minority stake in the Red Devils.The British billionaire's arrival in February 2024 was greeted with glee by supporters desperate to see a new face at the helm after years of underachievement under the Glazer family, who still own a majority stake.Yet hopes that the boyhood United fan could make United competitive again at home and in Europe have so far been dashed.- No 'knee-jerk reactions' -Just a few months ago, Ratcliffe, 73, said Amorim had three years to prove himself despite a tough start at United, adding that the club would not be drawn into ""knee-jerk reactions"".But United have continued to drift, winning just one of their past five home games in the league.An apparent rift with the club's director of football Jason Wilcox over tactics and transfer targets appears to have increased the pressure on Amorim, who was dismissed on Monday after 14 months in charge.Wilcox moved into his current position in June last year, taking over the main role held by Dan Ashworth, who lasted just five months at the club in an early embarrassment for the new regime.Ratcliffe has so far done little to suggest he can deliver on his desire to restore a club he admitted ""has become mediocre"" to former glories.The club's ambition to win a 21st league title by the time of their 150th anniversary in 2028 looks less realistic with every passing season.United finished the 2024/25 campaign in 15th spot -- the club's lowest top-flight finish since they were relegated in 1974 -- and missed out on European football for only the second time in 35 years.Despite a marginal improvement this season, Amorim departed with his side 17 points adrift of leaders Arsenal after 20 games.The club are still within striking distance of the top four but cannot afford to lose further ground.- Transfer flops -Ratcliffe has been publicly scathing of some of United's transfer dealings prior to his arrival but the jury is still out on incomings on his watch.Joshua Zirkzee and Manuel Ugarte have largely been peripheral figures since being signed under the managerial regime of Erik ten Hag, Amorim's predecessor.Amorim was armed with an expensive new front three of Benjamin Sesko, Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo in the recent summer transfer window but they have scored just 12 Premier League goals between them so far.United's ability to spend their way out of their troubles is beginning to be squeezed by financial sustainability rules.The club's desperate need to return to the lucrative Champions League will have been a factor in their decision to axe Amorim, who arrived in November 2024 feted as one of the game's leading young managerial talents.To compound matters for United fans starved of success, Ratcliffe is asking them to pay more to attend games.At the same time, he has been criticised for swingeing job cuts as he tries to restore order to the club's finances.Last year United set out plans for a 100,000-seater stadium to replace their historic but creaking Old Trafford ground.Ratcliffe said the club planned to have the ""world's greatest football stadium"", with hopes it could be finished within five years, though there is major uncertainty over the timescale.Plans on and off the pitch are undoubtedly ambitious, but they are a long way from being realised.",Amorim is the first boss to be hired and axed since Jim Ratcliffe took control of the club's football operations.

Manchester United on Monday sacked head coach Ruben Amorim, hours after the Portuguese spoke about tensions within the club following Sunday’s 1-1 draw against Leeds United. Amorim had said the club hierarchy needed to ""do their job"" and that he should be allowed to work without interference.The 1-1 draw at Elland Road was Amorim’s final match of his 14-month spell in charge. The result left Manchester United sixth in the Premier League after 20 matches.“With Manchester United sitting sixth in the Premier League, the club’s leadership has reluctantly made the decision that it is the right time to make a change,” United said in a statement. “This will give the team the best opportunity of the highest possible Premier League finish.”Former midfielder and current Under-18s coach Darren Fletcher is expected to take charge on an interim basis. His first match is likely to be away at Burnley on Wednesday night. The club is expected to make a permanent appointment in the summer.Reports had claimed that United’s head of recruitment, Christopher Vivell, asked Amorim to adapt his tactics after Fulham manager Marco Silva explained how his team planned to counter United’s system during their draw in August.Amorim changed his usual three-man defence for the win over Newcastle but returned to his preferred system in draws against Wolves and Leeds.Amorim was appointed in November 2024 after Erik ten Hag was sacked. The decision to remove him was taken by the club’s leadership, including chief executive Omar Berrada and director of football Jason Wilcox, following a breakdown in relations.Under the terms of his contract, which runs until 2027 with an option for a further year, United will have to pay the full amount, as there is no clause for a reduced exit.After the Leeds match, Amorim said, ""It’s going to be like this for 18 months or when the board decide to change. That was my point, I want to finish with that. I’m not going to quit. I will do my job until another guy is coming here to replace me.""Amorim had faced criticism for sticking to a 3-4-3 formation. Before the Leeds game, he spoke about differences over the system and difficulties in signing players suited to it. He again used the 3-4-3 against Leeds.",Manchester United sack head coach Ruben Amorim. The Portuguese had spoken about tensions within the club.

Gonzalo Garcia bagged a hat-trick for Real Madrid as they beat Real Betis 5-1 on Sunday to stay on La Liga leaders Barcelona's tail. Spanish striker Garcia, filling in for the injured Kylian Mbappe, opened the scoring after 20 minutes and then volleyed home a superb second early in the second half to give Madrid a commanding lead.Raul Asencio further extended Xabi Alonso's side's advantage before Cucho Hernandez pulled one back for Manuel Pellegrini's visitors, sixth.Madrid youth academy product Garcia completed his hat-trick after 82 minutes with a clever flicked finish to delight fans at the Santiago Bernabeu, with Fran Garcia notching a late fifth.Madrid, second, cut Barca's lead back down to four points after the champions edged Espanyol 2-0 in a Catalan derby on Saturday.Atletico Madrid, fourth, were held 1-1 at Real Sociedad later on.Madrid's victory eased the pressure on Alonso, who scraped through to 2026 at the helm despite reports he was on the verge of being sacked after a run of inconsistent form.With top goalscorer Mbappe sidelined with a knee sprain, Alonso turned to 21-year-old forward Garcia to replace him, as he did during the Club World Cup last summer.Garcia's opportunities have been limited this season despite acquitting himself well in the United States and he proved himself again.""These were three very special goals, my first hat-trick here at the Bernabeu, my first goals this season as well,"" he told reporters, before admitting he still faces a fight for minutes.""In front of me I obviously have the best players in the world, like Mbappe, Rodrygo (Goes), (Jude) Bellingham, Vinicius,"" he continued.""I just focus on myself, which means working day by day and taking the opportunities the coach gives me, like today, and I hope I can deliver and help my teammates every minute I get.""Madrid started strongly and took a deserved lead through Garcia's looping header from Rodrygo's free-kick.Betis battled back into the game and were the more dangerous team in the remainder of the first half, although they could not test Madrid goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois.Madrid extended their lead early in the second half after an excellent finish from Garcia, who controlled Fede Valverde's long ball on his chest and volleyed home from the edge of the box.Asencio, who also came from Madrid's youth academy, nodded home Rodrygo's corner for Madrid's third before the hour mark in one of the more convincing performances under Alonso.With the points secured, Madrid relaxed and Betis created some danger, with Giovani Lo Celso and Rodrigo Riquelme hitting the woodwork and Hernandez rounding Courtois before drilling home.Garcia restored Madrid's three-goal advantage with a lovely flick from Arda Guler's cross, drawing applause from the watching Mbappe.Late on defender Fran Garcia, who played with Madrid at youth level before moving to Rayo Vallecano, fired home Valverde's cross to round off an emphatic victory.""It's a great stat, that the five goals were scored by academy players, it shows the great work being done there,"" said Alonso.""In Gonzalo's case, with his hat-trick, I'm very happy for him and the team, it was an important and deserved win.""Real Madrid next face rivals Atletico in the Spanish Super Cup semi-finals in Saudi Arabia on Thursday.Diego Simeone's side could only manage a draw at Real Sociedad, leaving them 11 points behind leaders Barcelona.Atletico pulled level with third-placed Villarreal on 38 points but have played two more matches than them and lost more ground in the Spanish title race.Alexander Sorloth headed Atletico ahead early in the second half but Goncalo Guedes levelled five minutes later to secure Real Sociedad's American coach Pellegrino Matarazzo a point in his first game at the helm.Simeone bemoaned big chances missed by Conor Gallagher and substitute Antoine Griezmann.""If we were sharper in the area we might have been able to cover up the discomfort that remains after this draw,"" said Simeone.It was an encouraging start for Matarazzo, with Real Sociedad having the better of Atletico for large periods.""There's a lot to like about the performance today, all the boys were connected, all 90 minutes of the game,"" said the New Jersey native.",Gonzalo Garcia scores a hat-trick as Real Madrid beat Real Betis 5-1.

Cunha was close to firing a winner late in the match with a curling shot from outside the box that struck the outside of the post.United has lost just two of its last 14 games in the league, but six draws during that run have seen Ruben Amorim's team struggle to keep pace with the top three in the standings.“This year I think we are in control of the games more often than last year,” Amorim told TNT Sports. “So it was a good game, but of course (I am) a little bit frustrated not to win.”Leeds is unbeaten in seven games and went ahead when Aaronson raced past United defender Ayden Heaven to shoot low into the far corner.Cunha scored his third goal in his last five games when latching onto a pass from substitute Joshua Zirkzee and sliding a shot past Leeds goalkeeper Lucas Perri.United has had to cope without injured inspirational captain Bruno Fernandes over the festive period as well as key forwards Bryan Mbeumo and Amad Diallo, who are playing at the Africa Cup of Nations.

Jim Harbaugh sends strong message after brother John’s Ravens exit







John Harbaugh's coaching future took center stage across the NFL on Tuesday, the moment Baltimore decided to close an era that lasted nearly two decades. The move stunned the league, not because of poor results, but because of the résumé left behind. Wins, division crowns, playoff runs and a Lombardi Trophy rarely come packaged with a pink slip. Yet the Ravens chose change, and the ripple effects were immediate.Inside that moment sat a brother’s confidence, calm and unshaken. Jim Harbaugh did not speak like someone worried about uncertainty. He spoke like someone who knows exactly how this story usually ends. Experience, respect and credibility still rule the NFL coaching market, and John Harbaugh owns all three in abundance.Jim admitted the decision caught him off guard. Eighteen seasons and a Super Bowl title build a sense of permanence. Still, surprise did not turn into doubt. Around the league, decision makers saw the same thing Jim did. A proven leader with close to 200 career wins does not wait long for opportunity. History favors coaches who combine adaptability with authority, and John has shown both.“John Harbaugh is the best coach I know, the best coach I’ve ever seen,” Harbaugh said, according to Daniel Popper of The Athletic.“I’m his brother, so I might be biased, but whatever team he goes to is going to be formidable. I just hope it’s in the NFC.”Jim did not hedge when pressed further. “He’ll be a head coach next year,” Jim said. “We’ll be playing against him in some form or fashion.” That certainty reflects league reality. Multiple franchises are searching for stability, culture and credibility. Those qualities do not require projection with John Harbaugh. They already exist.“It’s great seeing the outpouring of support,” Jim added. “It’s so cool to see all my brother’s accomplishments recognized.” That recognition extends beyond fans. According to ESPN’s Adam Schefter, several teams contacted Harbaugh’s agent within the first hour of the news. Interest reportedly came even from organizations that already employ head coaches.Openings with the Giants, Falcons, Cardinals, Browns, Raiders and Titans create a crowded market. Early buzz suggests New York and Atlanta could be especially aggressive. Jim believes whichever franchise lands his brother will receive “a gift,” a rare combination of proven leadership and fresh motivation.One door closed firmly in Los Angeles. Asked if John could assist the Chargers during their playoff push, Jim shut it down. “He’ll be a head coach next year,” he reiterated. No side roles. No placeholders.As Jim prepares the Chargers for their Wild Card clash with New England, John Harbaugh’s next chapter feels less like a question and more like a countdown.Also Read: John Harbaugh's future: 3 possible landing spots for former Ravens' coach",Jim Harbaugh says brother John will be a head coach in the NFC next season.

Rashee Rice controversy deepens after ex-girlfriend accuses him of sustained domestic abuse over several years







Rashee Rice domestic abuse allegations have cast a long shadow over one of the NFL’s brightest young receivers, shifting attention away from football and toward deeply personal claims that surfaced online this week. His ex-girlfriend has accused him of domestic abuse.Rice remains an active member of the Kansas City Chiefs, a franchise that sits at the center of the league’s spotlight. While no official action has been announced, the gravity of the claims has already sparked widespread debate, fueled by images, words, and emotions that are difficult to ignore.The allegations came to light after ex-girlfriend Dacoda Nichole posted a carousel on Instagram showing visible injuries and damage inside a home. Alongside the images, she shared a detailed caption describing what she says was a long pattern of physical and emotional abuse, control, and intimidation that spanned several years. According to Nichole, her silence was never consent. She says it was a choice made to protect someone else’s reputation, a choice she could no longer sustain.“DOMESTIC AWARENESS WARNING‼️” Nichole posted in the Instagram caption.Her words grew more personal and more painful as the caption continued.“I’m so tired of keeping quiet I’m so tired of protecting his image. I’ve been through too much in a span of 8 years and I’ve had ENOUGH!” Nichole continued. “I’ve dealt with abuse for years, me and this man decided to break up a couple months ago and since then it’s been nothing but hell.”Nichole alleged that the behavior did not stop even during pregnancy, and that control extended into her living situation and finances.“He’s very controlling there’s been times he’s came to my new home broken my door, there’s been times when he would put his hands on me while I was pregnant even had the audacity to lock me outside all night in ten degree weather because he got caught cheating. He’s cut up all my shoes and clothes leaving me with nothing because he’s gotten caught up.”She also claimed Rice failed to show up consistently as a father and partner.“And there’s multiple instances of cheating but besides that I’m just tired of him not doing right by my boys.” Nichole wrote. “It’s not fair he doesn’t call them. He rather be layed up with hoes. He literally left us in Kansas and I had to beg him to send money so that I could drive to Texas with my kids and all our stuff. We have an agreement because of everything he’s put me through and he still doesn’t follow it.”Her post ended with a clear statement of intent and resolve.“He’s now trying to remove me and my kids from our home for no apparent reason. I’ve known this man for YEARS. He tries to put on this persona like he’s dad of the year. He does the bare minimum and I have to beg for that. I’ve protected his image too long and I’m done doing that. It’s time to protect my peace, protect my children and stand up for myself”.At the time of publication, Rice has not responded publicly. No legal filings or league statements have been confirmed. For now, the allegations stand as claims, but their impact is already being felt, both within the fan community and across a league that has repeatedly pledged to take personal conduct seriously.Also Read: Body language expert claims Tom Brady was genuinely intrigued following intimate St. Bart’s dance-floor hook-up moment with Alix Earle","Rashee Rice’s ex-girlfriend accuses him of years of domestic abuse.

Alix Earle-Tom Brady body language reveals mutual attraction







Alix Earle and Tom Brady's body language set tongues wagging long before words ever mattered at a packed New Year’s Eve party in St. Barth’s. The room pulsed with music, but it was the silent exchange that drew the most attention. Cameras caught a brief dance-floor moment that felt casual on the surface, yet charged underneath. What followed was not gossip built on guesswork, but a reading of movement, posture, and response that told a clearer story than any caption could.Freshly single and confident, Earle did not hesitate. Brady, relaxed and composed, responded in ways that seasoned observers recognize instantly. According to experts who study nonverbal cues for a living, this was not random party behavior. It was a textbook example of mutual curiosity unfolding in real time, step by step, without a single spoken promise.Body language expert Inbaal Honigman broke down the exchange with striking precision. “When Alix dances next to Tom, she displays her bare shoulder seductively. Her raised shoulder, as it pointedly juts towards Tom, is meant to create interest and attraction. It's an initial flirty move,” she explained.That opening signal was followed by intent eye contact and a clear shift in stance.“Her eye contact with him, and then turning her body towards Tom, forms a clear and flirtatious appetizer, ahead of the main course of touching him fully with her right hand.”Honigman noted that Earle moved carefully at first. “She is first seen lightly touching his arm, testing the waters. This initial light brush of Tom's arm sees Alix assessing whether he will accept her flirting and physical contact, or if he will pull away from it.” Brady did neither. Instead, his body leaned in. “Realizing that Tom is leaning towards her, interested in her touch, Alix continues stroking him across his back. ”That lean mattered. “Tom's deep lean towards Alix is his way of reciprocating her attention and asking for more,” Honigman said, adding, “When someone leans towards a person, they're bowing down. He's telling her, wordlessly, that he'll do anything as long as she keeps touching him.”Even restraint spoke volumes. “Tom's arms are gathered in front of him at this stage, which is a protective gesture,” she observed. Still, joy slipped through. “The happy, energetic bum-jiggle reveals how delighted he is that Alix is giving him all this attention. He's having the best time, and he doesn't want it to stop.”The turning point came fast. “At this point, Tom can no longer remain aloof, and he places his hand, quickly and decisively, on Alix's waist.” Honigman was clear on the meaning. “This is an intimate move which signals attraction.” She concluded simply, “Alix initiates the connection, and her gamble is a winner. Tom's moves are subtle, but he is 100 percent flattered and interested.”Also Read: Brittany Mahomes celebrates baby Golden’s growth as Patrick Mahomes leaves fans guessing with silent post",Alix Earle and Tom Brady's body language set tongues wagging at a packed New Year's Eve party.

He claims her public comments about their marriage caused him unwanted attention and ridicule. Haley Kalil denies the allegations, stating she spoke truthfully about their past relationship. The case explores the boundaries of free speech for public figures in the digital age.

Inside the lawsuit and the response pushing back





Public breakups often fade quietly. This one did not. What began as a livestream confession has now escalated into a legal fight that blends privacy, fame, and free speech. At the center is Haley Kalil, who is pushing back after her ex-husband Matt Kalil filed a lawsuit over remarks she made about their marriage.The filing has drawn attention not because of its size, but because of what it challenges. The former Minnesota Vikings player claims the comments pulled him back into public scrutiny he had tried to leave behind. Kalil, now remarried, says the fallout has reached his family in ways he did not expect.In the complaint, ex NFL star Matt Kalil alleges Haley Kalil shared what his legal team describes as deeply personal details with no public value. His attorney Ryan Saba said, “[Haley] Kalil disclosed private and intimate details about Matt Kalil that were of no legitimate public concern and subjected Matt Kalil and his family to widespread ridicule and unwanted attention.” He added that her actions were “extreme, outrageous, beyond all possible bounds of decency. ”Haley’s response has been swift and firm. Her attorney Matthew Bialick dismissed the case as overreach.“The claims seek to dramatically expand existing law and establish damaging new precedent by imposing liability on a woman for merely speaking openly and truthfully about a prior relationship,” he said. “That raises serious First Amendment concerns, especially in a case involving two public figures.”Haley also addressed the lawsuit directly. “The truth is in the original livestream which is still live on Marlon’s YouTube account. I speak highly of him in multiple ways throughout that conversation.” She added that she was “genuinely shocked and incredibly hurt upon receiving the news of this filing.”“Litigation is a harrowing and emotionally draining experience, and I am heartbroken that he is choosing to subject us and our families to this ordeal,” she said.Matt, 36, is seeking damages exceeding $75,000 and a jury trial. Beyond money, the case raises a larger question. Where does personal truth end and legal liability begin when public figures speak freely in a digital world watched by millions.Also Read: Matt Kalil breaks silence with lawsuit, targeting ex Haley Kalil over humiliating viral comments claims","Former NFL star Matt Kalil has filed a lawsuit against his ex-wife.

Matt Damon delivers rare praise for Kylie Kelce that leaves NFL fans nodding

Hollywood rarely collides with NFL family life in a way that feels genuine, but this moment landed because it was unpolished and real. During a relaxed conversation that drifted from football to fatherhood, a simple story reshaped how fans see the Kelce household. It was not about fame, trophies, or headlines. It was about presence, patience, and quiet strength.For followers of the Philadelphia Eagles legend Jason Kelce and his brother, Travis Kelce of the Kansas City Chiefs, the praise carried weight. Coming from an Oscar winner, Matt Damon, it felt unexpected. Coming from one parent to another, it felt earned.Appearing on the New Heights podcast, Matt Damon was asked for parenting advice. He declined, then offered something better. A story.""There was a time when you guys went to eat-or at least your wife did-at a restaurant in Montana. Ming Tsai is the chef there, and Ming's a friend of mine, and he told me this was the greatest thing. He goes, 'Jason Kelce's wife is a rock star,'"" Damon said.He continued without softening the moment. ""He literally was like 'she's got, like, an eight-month-old on one arm.She's got a toddler here. She had, she had four kids hanging off her. She's a boss',"" Damon added. ""So I don't think I need to give you any advice, because it sounds like you married the right woman. She's a boss.""Jason, who was working on ESPN’s Monday Night Football that night, filled in the rest with humor. ""She's got to deal with me, too. A fifth kid."" Then the truth beneath the joke followed. ""She's phenomenal, she's incredible with the kids.""That exchange did more than earn laughs. It reframed Kylie Kelce not as a sideline figure, but as the steady center of a high profile family. Fans already admired her authenticity.

New England Patriots face growing Stefon Diggs distraction before playoffs







The New England Patriots are winning games again, but the noise around them refuses to fade quietly. Foxborough has always known how to handle pressure. What feels new is how often football headlines now compete with celebrity drama. Inside the building, optimism runs high around a second-year quarterback who already looks like the future of the franchise. Outside it, the conversation keeps drifting toward social media clips, relationship rumors, and tabloid-style chaos that threatens to pull attention away from the field.That contrast defines this Patriots season. On one end is the wholesome image of Drake Maye’s inner circle, led by Ann Michael Maye, whose viral moments feel harmless and community driven. On the other is a constant swirl around Stefon Diggs and his superstar partner Cardi B, a storyline that never seems to cool down for long. The disconnect tests the calm culture Mike Vrabel is trying to protect.The uncomfortable truth is that the New England Patriots need Stefon Diggs, even when the attention becomes exhausting. Strip away the drama and the numbers tell a blunt story. Diggs was the engine of the passing attack, finishing with 1,013 receiving yards. No other wide receiver came close. Kayshon Boutte trailed by 462 yards, while tight end Hunter Henry ranked second overall with 768.Without Diggs’ explosiveness, Drake Maye’s ceiling drops fast.That is why patience exists where it normally would not. If Diggs carried a lower profile, the tolerance would likely be gone already. But playoff football is ruthless, and Maye needs a receiver who can flip momentum in a single snap if the Patriots want a legitimate Super Bowl push.The latest Diggs and Cardi B episode arrived at the worst possible moment, just as the postseason began. The rap icon clapped back at Diggs’ most recent accuser, extending a pattern that has followed the team all year, even after the couple welcomed their newborn son in November. It makes for viral content, not ideal preparation for chasing a Lombardi Trophy.That context made the Patriots’ timing feel deliberate when they released a mic’d up sideline exchange.""I can throw some blocks if you need,"" Diggs quips.""You need to shut the f**k up,"" Vrabel retorts.The exchange came across as playful, almost reassuring. The message was clear. Diggs is engaged. Vrabel is in control. Rookie lineman Will Campbell later praised Vrabel’s ability to connect with different personalities, reinforcing the idea of unity.Still, even the strongest coaches grow weary of constant off-field noise. As the Chargers loom in the Wild Card round, the Patriots know one thing for certain. Talent wins games, but distractions have ended more than a few championship dreams. Whether this one proves manageable will define how far New England really goes.Also Read: John Harbaugh's future: 3 possible landing spots for former Ravens' coach","New England Patriots face growing Stefon Diggs distraction before playoffs.

“It’s going to get worse”: Sherrone Moore’s exit exposed a double standard many black coaches quietly acknowledge,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/its-going-to-get-worse-sherrone-moores-exit-exposed-a-double-standard-many-black-coaches-quietly-acknowledge/articleshow/126395815.cms,"Sherrone Moore's dismissal from the University of Michigan has ignited a crucial debate on racial bias in college football coaching. The article highlights how Black coaches face collective judgment and fewer second chances compared to their white counterparts, impacting opportunities for an entire community. This raises urgent questions about fairness and access in the sport.

Why Sherrone Moore’s fall is being judged differently than similar scandals





College football rarely judges mistakes in isolation. When Sherrone Moore was dismissed from his role at University of Michigan, the fallout extended far beyond one program or one season. His firing reopened a familiar and uncomfortable conversation about race, opportunity, and how failure is weighed differently depending on who holds the clipboard.At the start of the 2025 season, the two most powerful conferences in the sport, the Big Ten and the SEC, employed just four Black head coaches combined. Four months later, only one remained. Moore’s fall became more than a scandal. For many, it became a symbol of how fragile progress can be.Former San Jose State coach Fitz Hill captured the problem simply. “These Black coaches are often evaluated collectively, while white coaches, our peers, are evaluated individually,” he said. “That's the difference. And that's because when you look at minorities, you group minorities. That's just a rational cognitive process.” He added that this reality does not make the system fair.Data backs that concern. Out of 136 Football Bowl Subdivision programs, only 14 Black head coaches remain, despite nearly half of FBS players being Black.The SEC has not hired a non interim Black head coach since 2020. In contrast, many white coaches survive firings and scandals and resurface with second or even third chances.Richard Lapchick of the Institute for Sport and Social Justice fears the climate will worsen. “I’m afraid that in the current climate, where DEI and efforts along those lines have been really sidelined in a major way, that it’s going to get worse, not better,” he said.Moore’s situation also revived comparisons that many see as unfair. Former NFL player Ryan Clark spoke to the broader impact, saying Moore’s failure affects others who follow. “He not only failed himself, but a community of coaches,” Clark said. “Had he succeeded the next ‘Sherrone Moore’ would have a favorable comp during his interview process.”History shows how rare second chances are. Only a handful of Black coaches, including Mike Locksley and James Franklin, have received another opportunity at the highest level after being fired. Meanwhile, white coaches such as Lane Kiffin have rebuilt careers with ease.The path forward, many argue, begins with access. Broader candidate pools, patient leadership, and fair evaluation matter. As Hill once asked bluntly, “What would have happened if Nick Saban would have been born Black?” The question still hangs over college football, unanswered, and increasingly urgent.Also Read: Will Sherrone Moore ever get a second chance in coaching?

A $3M gesture from Russell Wilson and Ciara is reshaping care for children in NYC

Giants QB Russell Wilson donates $3 million to Mt. Sinai Children's Hospital





As the new year opened in New York, generosity rather than glamour defined one of the city’s most high-profile couples. Russell Wilson and Ciara quietly made a $3 million donation to Mount Sinai Kravis Children's Hospital, signaling a deeply personal commitment to pediatric care that goes far beyond headlines or public appearances.The contribution, made through the couple’s Why Not You Foundation, is designed to reshape how young patients experience long hospital stays. Rather than focusing only on treatment rooms, the funding targets therapeutic play areas and creative arts spaces where children can briefly step away from medical routines and feel like kids again.Wilson has often spoken about how hospitals shaped his own upbringing. “You know, my dad was unfortunately always in the hospital, he had diabetes. My mom was an ER nurse when I was growing up. So, for me, I felt like, how I could make a difference somewhere,"" he said during an appearance on Good Morning America. That early exposure left a lasting mark and continues to guide how he gives back.The donation will also help enhance the hospital’s common areas and children’s holiday shop, spaces meant to offer comfort during some of the most difficult days families face.Wilson’s connection runs even deeper. He visits the hospital every Tuesday, spending time with patients and families away from the spotlight.Ciara echoed the emotional weight behind the gesture in a statement, saying, “Russell and I are so honored and humbled to support the incredible work happening at Mount Sinai Kravis Children’s Hospital. Giving back through partnerships like this is a dream for us.""Our mission with the Why Not You Foundation has always been to open doors and create spaces where young people feel supported and inspired. We’re beyond blessed to help expand these therapeutic environments so children and their families can experience moments of joy, creativity, and healing when they need it most.""For Wilson, the impact outweighs any professional milestone. “I want [the kids] to be inspired,” he said. “And I want them to take their mind a little bit off of the pain they’re going through.“It’s probably been the greatest thing I’ve been able to do in my career so far,” he added. “It’s better than any touchdown or any trophy.”Also Read: What promise did Chloe Kim make to Myles Garrett?

Cardi B recreates Gisele Bündchen’s post-wedding look as Stefon Diggs steps into Tom Brady’s old spotlight,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/cardi-b-recreates-gisele-bndchens-post-wedding-look-as-stefon-diggs-steps-into-tom-bradys-old-spotlight/articleshow/126394717.cms,"Rapper Cardi B made a bold fashion statement, wearing a dress similar to one seen on Gisele Bündchen. This appearance coincided with footballer Stefon Diggs facing serious allegations. Cardi B publicly defended Diggs, sharing her strong support. Her striking outfit and vocal backing signaled loyalty and confidence during a challenging time for Diggs, who continues to perform on the field.

Cardi B’s Gisele Bündchen-inspired look steals focus as Stefon Diggs navigates pressure on field





Fashion, fame, and pressure all crashed into the same moment of time when Cardi B walked out in a statement of a look that immediately drew the attention of the internet. The costume, a hugging, open neckline snake-skinned dress, was purposeful and rebellious. It also arrived at a time when every move connected to Stefon Diggs was under intense scrutiny, making even a style choice feel loaded with meaning.What elevated the moment further was the comparison it sparked. The dress mirrored one worn weeks earlier by Gisele Bündchen during her first public appearance after her second marriage. For Cardi, the visual overlap played out not just as fashion mimicry but as a statement of presence while standing firmly beside Diggs during a turbulent stretch.Cardi shared photos and videos of the look on Instagram while playing her track “Killin' You H**s.” Her styling closely echoed Bündchen’s appearance, from the flowing curls to the confident posture.Bündchen had worn the dress at a Vivara jewelry event in São Paulo on December 19, shortly after marrying Joaquim Valente earlier that month. The timing mattered. Cardi’s post followed her vocal defense of Diggs as he faced serious allegations from a former private chef.Taking to X, she did not hold back, writing:“Not once has that woman said anything to me about being touched.. NOT ONCE!! Mind you, we was talking every single day until she left that house and she JUST wrote me this.. but I’m gonna let the courts handle st and when it gets handled I want all y'all talkin st on your fkin knees with apologies just as loud the way yall been harassing over a lie.. and I put that on my two month old son in the name of the lord!! That’s how confident I am. ”Diggs has denied all allegations through his attorney, while the New England Patriots confirmed their cooperation with authorities and the NFL. Amid legal proceedings and playoff implications, Cardi’s appearance read as more than style. It signaled loyalty, confidence, and refusal to retreat, even as Diggs continued to deliver on the field and push past milestones once set by Julian Edelman.Also Read: “Trash”: Cardi B faces major backlash after dragging her two month old son into Stefon Diggs defense","Cardi B wore a snake-skinned dress similar to one worn by Gisele Bündchen.

Brittany Mahomes opened up about online criticism and shared how Patrick Mahomes shaped her mindset,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/brittany-mahomes-opened-up-about-online-criticism-and-shared-how-patrick-mahomes-shaped-her-mindset/articleshow/126394060.cms,"Brittany Mahomes revealed on a podcast how her husband, Patrick Mahomes, helped her develop a thicker skin against online criticism. She explained that she no longer cares what people say, as she is confident in herself, her relationship, and their lives. This shift in perspective has become a defining aspect of her public persona.

Brittany Mahomes explains how online backlash reshaped her approach to fame and criticism

Brittany Mahomes: Family, Fitness, and Partnership with the MVP





Brittany Mahomes had to learn a lesson most people never got to publicize. As her image rose with the prominence of her husband in the NFL, criticism came swiftly, loudly and partly intrusively. What was special at the moment was not the noise, but the degree of wanting to tune it off that she decided.That attitude took shape in a 2024 podcast appearance, which is now seen as one of the defining moments in the way Brittany defined fame, criticism, and personal conviction. Central to it was the fact that she believed that once confidence is gained there is no need of approval by the people to sustain it.Speaking on the WHOOP Podcast, Brittany credited Patrick Mahomes for helping her develop a thicker skin as online backlash intensified. “He is very good at blocking people out so having him beside has helped,” she said. “The main thing he always told me is to stop caring what people think – especially the people that don't even know you.”That advice proved crucial during a period when her social media activity drew attention for signaling support for Donald Trump , a stance that sparked debate given her proximity to Taylor Swift, who was then dating Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce.Brittany did not soften her response. “I think social media used to get to me a lot. Now, it's just like, honestly, I don't give a f*** what people have to say about me anymore,” she said. “I am strong in who I am. I am confident in who I am. I confident in mine and his relationship and I am confident in our lives. So why does what other people say have to matter at all?”At the time, the Mahomes family stood firmly in the spotlight of the Kansas City Chiefs dynasty era. Looking back, Brittany’s comments read less like defiance and more like a personal boundary drawn early. In a world quick to judge, she chose certainty over approval, a stance that has since become part of her public identity rather than a momentary reaction.Also Read: “A broken back…”: Brittany Mahomes shares alarming health update amid Patrick Mahomes’ own rehab","Brittany Mahomes said she no longer cares what people say about her.

With retirement talk intensifying and public scrutiny growing, the moment has reportedly created emotional strain. The convergence of personal milestones and professional uncertainty is adding unexpected stress as the high-profile couple prepares for their next chapter.

A chapter Travis Kelce moved past is now testing Taylor Swift’s calm





As wedding plans quietly take shape, a long-buried chapter from Taylor Swift’s fiancé Travis Kelce has unexpectedly resurfaced, stirring unease behind the scenes. Instead of a flawless, joyful countdown to one of the most hyped marriages in pop culture history, it has been characterized by renewed worry as to whether the past can reverberate so strongly in the present.Timing is important to Swift, who has constructed his career through precision, storytelling, and control of emotions. The controversial history of Travis Kelce during his college days has become a fresh point of debate at a time when criticism is already at peak levels. With global focus squarely on the couple, even age-old truths may seem new and shaky when they collide with the image of a well-guarded image.The source of the concern traces back to Kelce’s candid discussion on the New Heights podcast, where he revisited a suspension during his sophomore year at the University of Cincinnati after failing a drug test. While Kelce framed the experience as a turning point that pushed him toward maturity and self-awareness, the renewed attention has reportedly left Swift unsettled.According to Radar Online, a source said, ""Taylor hates that this has become a talking point again. She's spent years crafting a clean, family-friendly image, and she's terrified that something from Travis's past could smear that.""Another insider added, ""She's incredibly proud of how hard he's worked to turn his life around – but this story coming back up makes her feel exposed.""The concern, the source noted, runs deeper than headlines: ""Taylor's brand thrives on control and positivity, and this just isn't part of that narrative.""Kelce himself has never shied away from accountability. Reflecting on the fallout, he shared, ""I had to sit down with a shrink for an hour a week…"" before adding, ""He got me to look at my life way more strategically. He got me to understand that you go through these emotions, and your reaction can either help you or hurt you or be indifferent.""Now a Super Bowl-winning star with the Kansas City Chiefs, Kelce’s growth is clear. Yet for Swift, the episode is a reminder that even redeemed stories can resurface at inconvenient times, especially when love, legacy, and reputation collide under the brightest spotlight.Also Read: “Still searching for those answers”: Travis Kelce reaches a breaking point as Taylor Swift hits another career high",Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce's wedding plans are under mounting pressure.

Bill Self dedicates the Kansas Basketball Team’s shocking overtime comeback to former staffer Scott Wart during the post-game interview

What was Scott Ward’s role within the Kansas Basketball Team?

Also Read:





It was an emotional win for the Kansas Basketball Team. Not because of the last-minute comeback in overtime, but also owing to the unfortunate passing away of a former staffer, Scott Ward. Ward breathed his last just 3 days before Kansas Basketball faced the TCU Horned Frogs. Coach Bill Self was the one who decided to dedicate the win to Ward during a post-game interview.Born in 1966, Ward gave more than 30 years of his life to the team. His unfortunate demise was announced by his wife on Facebook. Even the official page of the Kansas Basketball team shared a tribute post honoring the legacy of the legend. Ward passed away on Saturday, January 3. Now dedicating the shocking last-minute win to Sott makes the entire thing very emotional.The Kansas Basketball Team was lagging behind the TCU Horned Frogs by 9 points. There was still a minute to go for the game to be over. It was at this moment that the freshman athlete Darryn Peterson stepped up to score three back-to-back free throws, all three-pointers. Peterson was fouled on a 3-pointer with just 1.7 seconds left.Both teams went into overtime and TCU’s missed dunks and KU’s on-time inbounds helped the latter secure a win with a 3-point lead. It was a dramatic win for the team. Right after the game ended, Melvin Council Jr. pointed towards the SW patch on their jerseys and said, “Do it for Scooter, man. Scooter was with us today.”Coach Bill Self, during a post-game interview, decided to officially dedicate the win to the late Scott Ward. He stated, “Whatever the announced attendance was tonight, we had plus-one, and I think that probably had as much to do with it as anything.” The coach further added, “Maybe our No. 1 fan for the last quarter-century was looking down on us.” The entire university mourned the death of the legend during the game in the stadium. Students were seen holding up his name, honoring the late athlete.Scott Ward completed his bachelor’s, master’s and doctoral degrees at the Kansas University. Immediately after this, he joined the athletic department's academic support program in the summer of 2003. Since then, both Ward and Bill Self have worked together. Ward worked primarily with the Men’s basketball and volleyball teams. He served as a mental performance coach and coordinator of support services.

What JJ Redick Really Meant

JJ Redick’s Coaching Approach With the Los Angeles Lakers

LeBron’s Shifted Role





JJ Redick didn’t try to soften his words after the Los Angeles Lakers beat the New Orleans Pelicans. He spoke plainly, and that honesty ended up explaining his working relationship with LeBron James better than any long breakdown could.The Lakers’ 111-103 win over New Orleans on January 6, 2026 pushed them higher in the Western Conference standings. But the game itself quickly took a back seat to what Redick said afterward. His comments spread because they felt real. They showed how a rookie head coach and a 41-year-old superstar actually operate during games.After the win, JJ Redick compared LeBron James to Greg Maddux late in his baseball career. His point was simple that James doesn’t dominate every night with raw force anymore, but he still knows how to win games. Redick described himself as the catcher trying to guide things, while admitting that sometimes James ignores him and calls his own play.JJ Redick didn’t say this as a complaint. He said it like a fact. James has been in the league for over two decades. When he sees something, Redick trusts him enough to step aside.The Los Angeles Lakers were riding a three-game winning streak and moved to 23-11, sitting third in the West behind the Spurs. Against the Pelicans, LeBron James finished with 30 points, eight rebounds, and eight assists. He controlled the fourth quarter while taking fewer shots than at any point in his career this season.Luka Dončić handled much of the scoring load. At 26, he averages 33.5 points per game and hit key threes late to close this one out. That balance lets James stay involved without carrying the offense every possession.Redick came into the job with doubts around his lack of experience. His past work talking basketball with LeBron James helped bridge that gap quickly. Now in his second full season, Redick has shown he’ll hold players accountable, including benching Deandre Ayton for defensive mistakes.With James, the rules are different. Redick allows more freedom because the results justify it. Both men are the same age and read the game the same way. James even has preferred spots on the floor where the offense flows through him naturally.After dealing with sciatica, James is averaging 29 points during the winning streak while shooting nearly 59 percent. His usage rate has dropped behind Dončić and Austin Reaves. James has openly said the team should adapt to Dončić, not the other way around.Also read: Los Angeles Lakers star Christian Wood's Domino's break-in claim: “Someone tried to set me up” as custody fight with ex Yasmine Lopez turns ugly The comment went viral because it sounded honest.

Wood and Lopez's Background and Career Context





Christian Wood has accused his former girlfriend, Yasmine Lopez, of being connected to a break-in at his rented home in Sherman Oaks, California. Wood believes the incident was not random and says it is tied to their ongoing custody dispute over their two-year-old son, Kobe.The situation has moved quickly from a police investigation to a family court battle. A judge has granted Wood temporary sole custody of their son and issued a restraining order. Lopez has denied all allegations and says she had no role in the incident.On November 5, 2025, around 12:30 p.m., a Domino’s pizza driver arrived at Christian Wood’s Airbnb-style rental. Wood did not answer because he had not ordered food. Minutes later, three masked individuals broke into the home by smashing a rear sliding glass door.Wood says he grabbed a firearm and fired three shots, which caused the intruders to run back to a vehicle and leave. No one was hurt, and nothing was taken from the house. Police later confirmed that a pizza order had been placed to Wood’s address and that someone called the restaurant to ask about the delivery. Investigators were unable to identify who made the order or the call.Wood claims the break-in was planned and meant to harm him. He says tensions with Yasmine Lopez had increased just a day earlier.According to Wood, Lopez refused visitation without explanation and picked up their son from school even though he was available.He also pointed to a social media post Lopez shared about an hour before the break-in. The post included a violent King Von song, gun emojis, and lyrics about retaliation killings. Wood described the timing as concerning.In court filings, Wood included alleged text messages from Lopez in which she reportedly wished him dead, said she would tell their son he was gone, and hoped he would get shot. He argued these messages showed a pattern of threats and hostility.Yasmine Lopez has said she had nothing to do with the break-in and only learned about it afterward. In Instagram stories, she described herself as the primary caregiver and accused Wood of acting out after losing a separate child support case involving another ex, reportedly worth $25,000 per month.She also claimed Wood has conflicts with multiple mothers of his children and sought her own protection order. Lopez alleged that Wood once grabbed her leg forcefully during a custody exchange.Wood and Lopez dated from August to December 2022 while he was with the Dallas Mavericks. Wood has also referenced an alleged August 2023 break-in and car vandalism at his property, which he previously linked to Lopez. He says threats from a member of her family happened before the November incident.Wood, a former Los Angeles Lakers player, was released in February 2025 after knee surgery and is currently a free agent. As his NBA future remains uncertain, he is now dealing with a serious legal fight off the court.","Christian Wood has accused his former girlfriend, Yasmine Lopez, of being connected to a break-in at his rented home.

Who was Jawann Oldham? Former Michael Jordan passes away at 68,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nba/top-stories/who-was-jawann-oldham-former-michael-jordan-passes-away-at-68/articleshow/126404588.cms,"Jawann Oldham. Image via: NBA.com

Jawann Oldham and the Bulls trade that shaped history



Jawann Oldham’s legacy beyond the NBA







Jawann Oldham, a former NBA center, died Monday in Atlanta. He was 68. Seattle University, his alma mater, confirmed his passing. Oldham played alongside Michael Jordan during the Chicago Bulls’ early years. His name rarely appeared in headlines and public chatter; however, his impact was remarkable.Oldham spent four seasons with the Bulls during a turbulent period for the franchise. Chicago was searching for direction, stability, and identity. Oldham’s role on the court was modest, though his presence became a turning point in franchise history. A later trade involving Oldham set off a chain of events that helped the Bulls acquire Scottie Pippen. The move somewhat changed the NBA landscape.Jawann Oldham joined the Bulls ahead of the 1983–84 season and played 47 starts across four years. He averaged 4.8 points and 4.2 rebounds during that stretch and appeared in five playoff games. His strongest season came in 1985–86, when he averaged 7.4 points, 5.9 rebounds, and ranked sixth in the NBA in blocked shots. Playing with Jordan during those early seasons demanded resilience, patience, and professionalism.His departure from Chicago carried lasting consequences. When Oldham signed an offer sheet with the New York Knicks, the Bulls matched the deal before eventually trading him.In return, Chicago received a future first-round pick that became the No. 8 selection in the 1987 NBA Draft. That pick played a central role in the draft-night maneuvering that delivered Scottie Pippen to the Bulls.Former Bulls coach Doug Collins remembered Oldham fondly, calling him “A free spirit and a person who loved his life.” Bill Cartwright offered deeper insight into Oldham’s rare athleticism, saying, “Incredible, maybe the most balanced seven-foot guy I’ve ever seen,” while also noting, “He was primarily a defensive guy, blocked shots and rebounded and wasn’t a big scorer.”Oldham’s basketball life extended far beyond the NBA. Born in Chicago in 1957 and raised in Seattle, he starred at Cleveland High School on back-to-back state championship teams. Seattle University retired his jersey in 2011 after a college career that included 1,530 points and 965 rebounds.Drafted No. 41 overall by the Denver Nuggets in 1980, Oldham played 10 NBA seasons with eight teams, averaging 4.4 points, 4.1 rebounds, and 1.7 blocks per game. After leaving the league, he became a global ambassador for the sport. Oldham lived for years in Abu Dhabi and Dubai, founded basketball leagues in South Korea and China, and helped develop the game across Asia.The NBA acknowledged his passing, writing, “The NBA mourns the passing of Jawann Oldham (1957-2026)… We extend our deepest condolences to the Oldham family.”Oldham, who is survived by his daughter, Jasmine, created a void in the basketball circle.Also Read: What is Cameron Brink's favorite cheat meal?

How Victor Wembanyama's injury happened

Victor Wembanyama's Official injury status before the Lakers game on Jan 7

Los Angeles Lakers arrive with their own questions

Why Wembanyama matters so much





Victor Wembanyama’s status is the main question before the San Antonio Spurs hosted the Los Angeles Lakers on January 7. He is listed as questionable with a left knee bone bruise, leaving his availability unclear until close to tipoff.The timing matters a great deal. This is a matchup between two teams near the top of the Western Conference standings, and Wembanyama’s presence would heavily influence how the game played out. Even after missing time, everything around the game revolves around whether he will play tonight.Victor Wembanyama injured his left knee on New Year’s Eve against the New York Knicks. He hyperextended it on a play that later resulted in a bone bruise. The Spurs held him out for two games to avoid further damage.He returned on January 6 against Memphis and came off the bench. In just 21 minutes, he scored 30 points. Despite how effective he looked, the coaching staff kept him on a minutes restriction and did not bring him back late in the game. San Antonio lost 106-105, but the bigger focus was how his knee responded.The NBA injury report released at 6:15 PM ET still lists Wembanyama as questionable for the 9:30 PM ET tipoff.The Spurs treat him as a game-time decision, especially with the team playing on the second night of a back-to-back.San Antonio enters the game with a 25-11 record, second in the West. The Lakers are close behind at 23-11, sitting third. The Spurs are coming off the loss in Memphis, while the Lakers arrived riding a three-game winning streak.The Lakers are led by Luka Dončić, with LeBron James also listed as questionable. If both stars play, the game will have the feel of a playoff matchup despite being early January.Betting lines favor San Antonio by 7.5 points. Wembanyama-related player props drew heavy attention, with many focused on whether he could clear the 21.5-point mark if he played.Wembanyama changes how teams play. His size affects shot selection, his defense alters spacing, and his scoring gives San Antonio Spurs options few teams can match. Even limited minutes force opponents to adjust.This season, he is averaging 24.3 points, 11.7 rebounds, and 2.9 blocks. Those numbers explain why his availability matters so much, especially for a Spurs team with championship goals.Also read: Is Luka Doncic playing tonight vs the San Antonio Spurs?

What to Expect Tonight in the Lakers vs Spurs Game





The Los Angeles Lakers will have their main offensive option available on January 7.and is not listed on any official injury report. Every major preview treats him as fully healthy and central to the Lakers’ plan for this game.That clarity matters, especially with several other Lakers dealing with injuries. With a 9:30 p.m. ET tip-off at Frost Bank Center, Doncic is set to handle his normal role as the primary scorer and playmaker.Recent injury reports for Lakers–Spurs include multiple Los Angeles players, but Doncic is not among them. His absence from those reports strongly points to him being available. Game previews and betting coverage also frame the matchup around Doncic facing Victor Wembanyama, which further supports the expectation that he will play.As usual, final confirmation comes when lineups are announced shortly before tip-off, but there has been no indication of a late change.Luka Doncic has carried the Lakers’ offense throughout the season. He leads the team in scoring and assists and has kept them near the top of the Western Conference standings. Some previews list him at around 33.5 points, 7.9 rebounds, and 8.7 assists per game, while others place him closer to 28.1 points, 6.2 rebounds, and 7.3 assists depending on the sample used.The numbers vary, but the role does not. The Los Angeles Lakers’ offense runs through Doncic on nearly every possession. Over his last 10 games, he has been making roughly 2.6 to 2.7 three-pointers per night, which stretches defenses well beyond the arc.San Antonio has been solid defensively at home, allowing about 114 points per game and ranking in the league’s upper third in points allowed. Their size, especially with Wembanyama, makes scoring inside more difficult.Wembanyama is listed as questionable with a left knee bone bruise. If he is limited or unavailable, the Spurs lose their best rim protector, which could force them to send extra help toward Doncic on the perimeter.The Lakers are short-handed. Austin Reaves and Rui Hachimura are out with calf injuries. Adou Thiero is sidelined with a right MCL sprain. Gabe Vincent is dealing with a back issue. LeBron James is questionable with left foot joint arthritis and right sciatica.If James sits or plays reduced minutes, Luka Doncic’s workload is likely to increase. That would put even more responsibility on him to create shots and set up teammates.Also read: Los Angeles Lakers vs San Antonio Spurs injury report: Injured and questionable players, where to watch, team stats, and more (Jan 7, 2026) Assuming no late changes, the Lakers will rely heavily on Luka Doncic from the opening minutes. He already scored 35 points against San Antonio earlier this season, and if the Spurs cannot slow him down, this game is likely to follow a similar pattern.",Luka Doncic is not listed on any official injury report for the Los Angeles Lakers.

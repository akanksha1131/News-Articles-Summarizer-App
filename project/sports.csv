Mohammed Shami returns, India get boost ahead of Border-Gavaskar Trophy | BTB Highlights

Siraj has lacked rhythm in last few Tests & shorter run-up could be the reason | #beyondtheboundary

Aussie top order not in best form

Conflicted about waking up early on Friday for the start of the Border Gavaskar Trophy? You clearly have a reason after what happened over the last one month in India, when Rohit Sharma's boys were handed a 0-3 humiliation by New Zealand at home.The World Test Championship Final berth, which looked likely before the start of the season, now looks a distant dream as Australian pacers lick their lips on a spicy Perth surface, known for its tennis-ball bounce.But if you can look through the mist of disappointment, you may figure a hint of silver lining as the Indian side prepares for a response. What exactly should give the Indian cricket fan some hope ahead of this massive challenge?It's the Indian pace attack, which is one of the best in the business. In Jasprit Bumrah, Mohammed Siraj , Akash Deep , Prasidh Krishna and Harshit Rana , the fast bowlers have all the ingredients to do well in Australia. This lot hardly had a role to play in the New Zealand debacle as the spinners called the shots on surfaces which were a little too spin-friendly for everybody's liking.The pitches in Australia will be completely different. The crucial thing about bowling in Australia is to understand the lengths to hit. While Bumrah, arguably the best paceman in the world across formats, has all the experience, Siraj, too, is a perfect fit for the fast and bouncy tracks. If Mohammed Shami can return sometime later on in the series, it will be the icing on the cake.Bumrah had 21 wickets in the 2018-19 series win. In Brisbane in January 2021, Siraj got 5-73 in the second innings that kept India's target to manageable proportions and allowed Rishabh Pant to go for that almighty chase.""Akash Deep has shown that he can be equally effective both against right-handers and lefthanders. He should be the third pacer and if there is a little bit of help for the seamers, all three can be as good as their Aussie counterparts,"" former India paceman L Balaji, who has experience of touring Down Under, told TOI.Balaji, who was edged out by Morne Morkel for the bowling coach's job a couple of months ago, wants India to play with only four bowlers in the first Test, the fourth being Ravindra Jadeja ""You don't need more than four bowlers on a spicy surface in Australia. The batters have to give a minimum of 250 to allow the bowlers to stay in the fight and for that, a proper batter at No. 7 is necessary,"" Balaji said.That brings us to the most crucial issue, the batting frailties of India in recent times. On a pitch which had a bit of help for pacers in Bengaluru in the first Test against New Zealand, India were bowled out for 46 by the Kiwi pacers, and the Aussie team management must have taken note of that.Having said that, the Australian top-order isn't in the best of form. While Usman Khawaja, in all probability, is playing his last home series, the hosts have a new makeshift opener in Nathan McSweeney, who will be making his debut in Perth. Marnus Labuschagne and Steve Smith haven't been in great form either, while Mitchell Marsh hasn't been too much of a headache for Indian bowlers ever. That leaves the top-order with Travis Head, a real thorn in the flesh for India in recent times, and a dependable wicketkeeper-batter Alex Carey.But if we have to do a man-to-man analysis, is Carey a better bet than Pant? You can make your own calculations. Add to that the fact that this Australian team, not too long ago, lost a Test against lowly West Indies at home, that exposed all the frailties in their batting.""The Indian bowling attack is perfectly capable of keeping this Australian batting line-up to a score of below 250, especially when there is a bit of help. From there on, it can become a batters' game and the likes of Kohli, Pant, Yashasvi Jaiswal and Shubman Gill (though out of first Test with finger injury), have the capability to score big in Australia,"" Balaji said.It's not going to be easy, but then, historically, when has a tour of Australia been smooth sailing? Be it Melbourne in 1980-81, Perth in 2007-08 or Brisbane in 2020-21, India hit back really hard when the chips were truly down. The Aussies too know that this Indian lot is made of some stern mettle and they experienced that first-hand twice at home not too long ago. Will the trend continue?",India take on Australia in first Test of Border-Gavaskar Trophy in Perth. Rohit Sharma's side were beaten 0-3 by New Zealand at home. India's fast bowlers have all the ingredients to do well in Australia. Australia's top-order is not in best form.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115399180,imgsize-78458,width-400,resizemode-4/115399180.jpg"

NEW DELHI: The forthcoming Border-Gavaskar Trophy stands as a critical series for India's head coach Gautam Gambhir .

The entire blame is being pinned on Gautam Gambhir,"" Harbhajan told Jatin Sapru on the his YouTube channel.""He has not batted or bowled, the blame cannot be put on him.

Give him time. It is not easy to run big teams,"" he added.Harbhajan further expressed his thoughts about how the five-match series against Australia would assess Gambhir's composure.""It is difficult to run big teams, everyone takes time. If the results were fine, everyone would have said 'see, Gautam is making the team win'. The series against Australia is important, a lot of things will be tested. Gautam Gambhir who will be sitting outside, his anger and patience will be tested,"" said Harbhajan.""He cannot control anything from the outside, big players get frustrated sitting on the sidelines.

Virat & Rohit’s Home Struggles: Left-Arm Spin & Lost Intent? | Beyond the Boundary Highlights

Rishabh Pant. The next Test captain | Beyond the Boundary Highlights | TOI Sports

NEW DELHI: Team India would be eyeing their third successive Test series win on the trot in Australia and the Aussies would be looking to go all guns blazing to stop the Indians in their bid in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy .With captain Rohit Sharma set to miss the first Test in Perth, pressure will be on rest of the Indian batters to come good in the series.And the maximum pressure undoubtedly will be on India batting mainstay and former captain Virat Kohli With 6 hundreds from 13 Tests in Australia at an average of 54.08, Kohli has a phenomenal record in Australia but has averaged merely 22.72 in six matches in 2024, the lowest in his career.Former Australia captain Michael Clarke picked Virat Kohli and flamboyant keeper-batter Rishabh Pant to play decisive roles for India to win the series in Australia.""Virat Kohli's record in Australia in phenomenal. I actually think his record is better than what it is in India. I think he's got six hundreds in 13 Tests in Australia,"" Clarke says during an interview.The 36-year-old Kohli has scored just one fifty this year - 70 against New Zealand in the second innings of the first Test at Bengaluru, while his last Test century came in July 2023 against the West Indies.With India set to play the first Test in Perth from November 22, Kohli can hope to strike form from the word go.Kohli has till now played two Tests in Perth - one at the WACA in which he scored 44 and 75 in the two innings in January 2012 which Australia won by an innings and 37 runs.The second Test that Kohli played in Perth was as captain in 2018 and he became the first batsman to score a Test hundred at the new Perth stadium as he scored his 25th Test century at the age of 30.Clarke continues, ""If India are to win this series, it has to be Virat Kohli leading run scorer with Rishabh Pant just behind.""During the fourth and final Test of India's last tour of Australia at the Gabba in January 2021, Rishabh Pant played one of the most iconic innings in Test cricket history.Pant played a fearless, match-winning knock, scoring an unbeaten 89 off 138 balls to chase down 328 runs on the fifth day as India achieved a record-breaking victory at the Gabba, a venue where Australia had been undefeated in Tests for 32 years.The innings highlighted Pant's fearless approach and unyielding belief, even under immense pressure. His aggressive mindset, combined with clever shot selection, helped India pull off one of the greatest chases in Test cricket.This was a major moment in his career and elevated his status as a cricketer who thrives in high-pressure situations and uses his attacking play style to turn games.India need to win 4 Tests in Australia to directly qualify for the World Test Championships final that is scheduled to be held at Lord's in June 2025.",Former Australia captain Michael Clarke picked Virat Kohli and Rishabh Pant to play decisive roles for India to win the series in Australia.

NEW DELHI: Ahead of Jake Paul’s blockbuster boxing match against the legendary Mike Tyson , a leaked fake script surfaced online, igniting speculation and excitement among fans.The fabricated document detailed a supposed Round 5 knockout victory for Paul, mimicking a similar hoax that circulated before Paul’s fight against Tommy Fury .Despite the buzz, there was no evidence to suggest the match was fixed.Instead, fans were treated to a legitimate showdown at AT&T Stadium in Dallas, where Paul claimed a hard-fought unanimous decision victory.The highly anticipated bout, delayed from its original July 20 date due to Tyson’s health issues, marked the 58-year-old former champion’s return to professional boxing after 19 years.Tyson entered the ring to deafening cheers from the crowd, while Paul, greeted with boos, relied on strategy and stamina to outlast the heavyweight icon.Tyson showed glimpses of his old brilliance early on, controlling the first two rounds with sharp, aggressive punches that forced Paul into defensive positions.The opening round saw Tyson land clean blows in the corner, while the second round mirrored his dominance as he capitalized on Paul’s low guard.However, by the third round, Paul began to find his rhythm. A triple jab rocked Tyson, pushing him to the ropes and signalling a shift in momentum. By Round 4, Tyson’s fatigue became evident, and Paul exploited the opportunity, landing precise body shots and controlling the pace.Heading into the final rounds with a slim 48-47 lead, Paul maintained his composure. Despite the crowd’s chants urging Tyson to mount a comeback, the 27-year-old boxer continued to dictate terms, ultimately securing a unanimous decision.

Langer emphasized the strength of the Indian team, despite their recent series loss to New Zealand.He cautioned against underestimating India, reminding everyone of their past successes in Australia.“One thing you never do is write off champions, and that’s in every sport, because they are a champion for a reason. In India, there are one and a half billion cricket-loving people, and then count all the rest around the world, they expect nothing but excellence, and the team will be under intense pressure, so how they fight back will be important."" said Langer to The West Australian on Sunday.Langer acknowledged the pressure on the Indian team but expressed his belief in their ability to bounce back. He also highlighted the star power within the Indian lineup, urging fans to savor their presence.“And they’ll be getting written off for being too old, but people say that all the time, and I just can’t wait to see them play. I just hope, if this is the last time (Kohli) is out here, people enjoy it because he is a superstar, so is Rohit Sharma , so is (Ravi) Ashwin, so is (Ravi) Jadeja, so is (Jasprit) Bumrah.""He drew parallels between the Australian and Indian teams, both boasting experienced bowling attacks, and encouraged fans to appreciate these players while they are still active.“It’s the same with the Australians; the bowling attack is a very senior attack now... so really enjoy it while you can; they are not going to be around forever,”To secure a spot in the World Test Championship final at Lord's next year, India needs to win at least four matches in the series.Langer believes India's recent loss to New Zealand might fuel their determination, making them a formidable opponent for Australia.“India losing to New Zealand is a bit like North Melbourne beating Brisbane in the grand final at the moment. And not for one millisecond is that disrespect for New Zealand, because they are the great overachievers; they are brilliant.""He acknowledged New Zealand's achievement in winning the series 3-0, emphasizing the pressure India will face to make amends for their performance.“I think they’d won two Test matches (in India), and to win the series 3-0, that’s an amazing achievement. They’ve just been beaten three-nil by New Zealand, so India will be humbled by that and equally determined to remedy it because the pressure on them will be intense.”","Former Australian cricketer and head coach Justin Langer shared his thoughts on the upcoming Border-Gavaskar Trophy.

Champions Trophy in PAK: More drama as Jay Shah strongly objects PCB's PoK plans

NEW DELHI: The Pakistan Cricket Board ( PCB ) on Sunday firmly denied reports suggesting Jason Gillespie ’s imminent exit as head coach.In a post on X, the PCB stated, “PCB strongly refutes the story. As announced previously, Jason Gillespie will continue to coach the Pakistan side for the two red-ball matches against South Africa.”Media speculation erupted recently, claiming Gillespie was set to be sacked just six months into his tenure.Reports alleged that Gillespie’s reluctance to oversee both red-ball and white-ball teams without a pay increase prompted the PCB to reconsider his role.However, the PCB insists that Gillespie remains committed, at least through the South Africa series.Adding to the turmoil, former Pakistan pacer Aaqib Javed is reportedly lined up to take over as Pakistan’s white-ball coach.Javed, currently serving as the men’s cricket selection convenor, is expected to step into the limited-overs role ahead of Pakistan’s upcoming tour of Zimbabwe, which begins on November 24.This uncertainty around Gillespie's future reflects a broader issue within Pakistan cricket: a pattern of frequent coaching changes undermining team stability.The PCB has faced criticism for its lack of long-term planning and frequent leadership reshuffles.Gillespie’s reported departure would follow a string of quick replacements, including his predecessor Gary Kirsten , who resigned citing insufficient time spent in Pakistan.Gillespie has delivered some notable successes during his short stint, including a 2-1 Test series win over England and a historic ODI series victory in Australia.Yet, these achievements appear overshadowed by the PCB’s apparent impatience and focus on short-term fixes.The PCB’s ability to foster a stable environment will be crucial as the team prepares for high-profile tournaments like the 2025 Champions Trophy .",Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB ) firmly denied reports suggesting Jason Gillespie ’s imminent exit as head coach.

'KL Rahul is going to unleash himself in the next three to five years'

Astrological analysis by Greenstone Lobo on StarPlay: Cricket & Astrology suggests that KL Rahul is going to dominate the next four to five years.""Rahul was once considered a great talent. However, his batting is not flourishing at the moment. He’s not doing well for himself and is creating more trouble as time goes on. The question is: will he overcome this slump and rise again? Will there be a resurrection for KL Rahul?""""Let’s delve into KL Rahul’s astrological aspects. Rahul has a phenomenal horoscope, with Pluto in the third house. Pluto, the most powerful planet in the universe, moves into its own house only once every 250 years. It was at 0° when KL Rahul was born, making it highly significant. This planetary position influences his hands, which are crucial for sports."" said the astrologer.""Rahul also has a powerful seventh house, the house of defeating enemies. Neptune, the lord of the seventh house, is exalted in a favourable star, making him a highly competent player who can outshine his opponents. We’ve seen Rahul at his best: travelling to different parts of the world, smashing bowlers, and dominating his rivals. But why is he struggling now?The astrologer highlighted two main reasons:Mindset Issues""KL Rahul has Mercury in Pisces. If you recall, Rahul Dravid had his Moon in the Pisces zodiac sign. Such placements can make players vulnerable when their confidence is low. Dravid, for example, often adapted his game based on the aggression of his partners, like VVS Laxman . Similarly, KL Rahul seems to feel an immense sense of responsibility, believing he must perform for the entire team’s success. This psychological burden might be hindering his performance. Someone needs to sit down with him to address this.""Astrological Factors""Rahul’s ninth lord is debilitated in the tenth house, which governs career. This weak planetary position is preventing him from converting his intent into results on the field. However, transformation is on the horizon. Pluto is set to undergo a significant shift by the end of this year, with its effects becoming evident by February or March next year."" he added.""This planetary change will likely result in a transformed KL Rahul. If he goes to Australia, he could perform exceptionally well. Selectors should persist with him, as he has the potential to deliver remarkable numbers,""""Looking ahead to the IPL, Rahul is currently without a team. However, he could become a tournament-winning captain for any side that picks him during the auction. Recent IPL winners, like Hardik Pandya and Shreyas Iyer , belong to the 1990s-born generation, and Rahul, born in 1992, fits this pattern."" he further added.""His strong seventh house, ruled by Neptune, indicates a bright future, with the ability to defeat opponents and lead teams to victory. It’s worth noting that Rahul is only 31 years old, with several years left in his career. He has the potential to achieve great things over the next three to five years,""""The best version of KL Rahul is yet to come. He will unleash his full potential, pile up runs, defeat opponents, and win tournaments. To those writing him off: be patient.

NEW DELHI: Former Australian cricketer Matthew Hayden believes India’s recent 3-0 Test series defeat to New Zealand, though disappointing, might ultimately benefit them ahead of the upcoming Border-Gavaskar Trophy .Speaking to the Sydney Morning Herald, Hayden described the whitewash as “the kick up the a*se that India need.” He noted, “Even though India copped a drubbing and were lightweight in terms of performance, playing long-format cricket gives them a preparation advantage.”India’s loss to New Zealand marked a historic low. The Black Caps sealed the clean sweep with a 25-run victory in the third Test at Mumbai’s Wankhede Stadium.This was India’s first home Test series whitewash in over two decades and their first-ever in a three-Test series or more.The result has led to significant introspection within the Indian camp as they prepare for the marquee series against Australia.The Border-Gavaskar Trophy begins on November 22 in Perth, with both teams aiming to assert dominance.Hayden suggested that India’s recent exposure to red-ball cricket might give them a leg up in adapting to the demands of the Test format, unlike Australia, who haven’t played long-format games recently.He remarked that India’s struggles could serve as a wake-up call, motivating them to bounce back stronger against a formidable Australian side.The series promises a packed itinerary, beginning with the opening Test in Perth. The second Test, from December 6-10, will be a day-night clash at Adelaide Oval, under lights.The contest then shifts to Brisbane’s Gabba (December 14-18) before the iconic Boxing Day Test at Melbourne Cricket Ground (December 26-30). The series finale at the Sydney Cricket Ground from January 3-7 could well be the decider.","Former Australian cricketer Matthew Hayden believes India’s recent 3-0 Test series defeat to New Zealand, though disappointing, might ultimately benefit them.

""He is likely to bat at the No 3 spot now,"" a reliable source told TOI.The left-hander, who was recently named in Karnataka's squad for the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy, made scores of 36, 88, 26, 1 for India 'A' during the Australia tour.While these performances aren't extraordinary, Padikkal's experience and familiarity with Australian conditions make him the ideal choice as a batting backup. The left-hander had made his Test debut against England earlier this year at Dharamsala and made a 65 while batting at No. 4.Going by sources, there's a good chance that Delhi and Kolkata Knight Riders pacers Harshit Rana , who is yet to get the India cap, may make his Test debut in the first Test at Perth.""Harshit was very impressive in the match simulation at Perth, especially while bowling his bouncers. There's a good chance that he will make his India debut at Perth,"" a source told this paper. Rana has played 10 first-class matches so far, in which he has picked up 43 wickets@24.00, with a best haul of seven for 45 in an innings. The 22-year-old was called as a net bowler during India's home Test series against New Zealand.The youngster impressed for the Kolkata Knight Riders in the IPL, taking 19 wickets in 13 matches@20.15, with a best haul of three for 24. When he was called up to bowl in the Team India nets just ahead of the third Test at the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai, Delhi head coach and former national selector Sarandeep Singh had said that Rana is ready for Test cricket.""If India wants him to play, I would love to see it. If he ends up playing a Test before going to Australia, then it is better for Harshit and for India, too, that they get a good fast bowler,"" Sarandeep had said.","Devdutt Padikkal will be added to the 18-member squad in Rohit's place for the first Test match at the Opus Stadium in Perth.

HYDERABAD: India head coach Marquez Manolo has not notched up a win in three matches, and he admitted his team needs ""to improve in everything"" during the international friendly against familiar opponents Malaysia on Monday.Under Manolo, who was appointed head coach in July, India has so far lost once while drawing twice. India drew against Mauritius and lost 0-3 to Syria in the Intercontinental Cup in September. The team drew with Vietnam 1-1 in its last match on October 12.If the Indian team does not get a positive result on Monday, it will end the year without a win in 11 matches. Monday's match will also be India's last before the 2027 Asian Cup Qualifiers in March next year.""Obviously, we want to win after a long time. Football is about attack, defence, transitions and set pieces. We need to improve in everything,"" Manolo said on Sunday at the pre-match press conference.""For example, people say you played a great second half in Vietnam. I say 'yes', but we still made some big mistake that almost made us lose the game. We need to work on that. The team with less mistakes usually are the one who wins the game.""We will try to play a good game with fewer mistakes than Malaysia. We know the style of Malaysia, I know the coach perfectly (well). They play good football and it will be a tough game for both teams,"" said Manolo.The two sides have faced each other 32 times and there's nothing to separate the two sides in head-to-head results. The Blue Tigers and the Harimau Malaya have won 12 matches each, while eight have ended in draws.There is also little difference in the current FIFA rankings , with India placed 125th and Malaysia 133rd.""It's a friendly game but it will be good to check the level against a Pot 2 team (Malaysia) in the qualifiers. We have gone a long time without a win, so obviously we want to win. We want to show the improvement that we've been making in every training session,"" said Manolo.The draw for the Asian Cup Qualifiers will be held on December 9. India, ranked 125, will be placed in Pot 1, while Malaysia, ranked 133, will be in Pot 2. Irrespective of the result of the Monday's game, India will maintain their position in Pot 1.Manolo said senior player and central defender Sandesh Jhingan , who is returning to action after recovering from an injury he sustained 10 months ago, is the ""most difficult Indian player to be replaced"".""You don't have these kinds of players. Not that he is Messi but because he is very important in the team, in terms of the leadership, how he performs, the character he is.""Forward Edmund Lalrindika , who accompanied Manolo in the press conference, said, ""This is our third camp with coach Manolo. He is a really great coach. The preparations have been good. Everyone is comfortable with him. I enjoy training with him. We all know what he wants from us. We're looking forward to tomorrow.""The India-Malaysia football rivalry goes back a long way -- since their first meeting in a 1957 friendly in Kuala Lumpur, which India won 3-0, until last year's Merdeka tournament semifinal clash in which Malaysia emerged 4-2 winners.Like Manolo, Malaysia head coach Pau Martí also hails from Barcelona and took charge of Harimau Malaya in July. Under him, they won the Merdeka tournament in September and lost 0-4 to New Zealand last month.Malaysia beat Laos 3-1 in a friendly in Bangkok on November 14 and arrived in India from the Thai capital late on Saturday night.""I am very excited to play against Manolo. He is a great coach with a lot of experience. We are from the same city. He coached many clubs at different levels, from the fourth tier to LaLiga. For coaches from Barcelona, Manolo is an inspiration.""He has been in India for three or four years, working with different clubs. I'm sure the Indian team will be well prepared,"" said Martí.""I believe it's very tough to play here. We expect a very difficult game. For us as a team, we have to improve our record away from home. It's been difficult to win away. So I think it will be a good challenge and opportunity for us,"" the Malaysian coach added.",India plays Malaysia in an international friendly in Hyderabad on Monday.

NEW DELHI: Brazilian club Palmeiras president Leila Pereira has firmly dismissed rumours linking Neymar Jr to her club, blatantly saying that she would consider bringing in players who are not match-ready.“Neymar will not join Palmeiras; this club isn’t a medical department,” Pereira said. “I want someone who can join immediately and play tomorrow if the manager wishes. I won’t accept us signing a player who’s unfit to play.”The statement comes amid Neymar’s ongoing injury woes.The Brazilian star, currently playing for Saudi Arabian club Al-Hilal, is sidelined due to a muscle issue. This setback has fueled speculation about his future with the club, particularly since he has struggled to make an impact since his high-profile transfer in August 2023.Neymar returned to action during Al-Hilal’s 3-0 AFC Champions League Elite victory over Iran's Esteghlal. Substituted in the 58th minute, his appearance marked only his second for the club in the respective competition following a year-long recovery from a serious injury.However, he was forced to leave the pitch after pulling up in the game’s closing moments.Al-Hilal coach Jorge Jesus later clarified that the injury was muscular and unrelated to Neymar's previous knee issues, estimating a two-week recovery period.Neymar addressed the situation on social media, expressing cautious optimism. “Hopefully nothing too much,” he wrote. “After one year out, this happens. The doctors had already warned me, so I have to be careful and gradually play more minutes.”Reports in Saudi Arabian media suggest Neymar's absence might extend to three weeks.With his limited contributions so far—only seven matches since his $90 million transfer—there is growing uncertainty over whether Al-Hilal will register him for the second half of the Saudi Pro League season.The club currently has its maximum allocation of 10 foreign players for domestic competitions, though Neymar remains eligible for continental tournaments.A new registration window in January could provide a resolution, but for now, Neymar’s future remains in limbo, with Palmeiras making it clear they are not an option.",Palmeiras president Leila Pereira has dismissed rumours linking Neymar Jr to her club.

Hyderabad: Still looking for the first win of the year as well as under head coach Manolo Marquez , India face familiar rivals Malaysia in an international friendly football match here on Monday. India will be bolstered by the return of senior player and central defender Sandesh Jhingan almost 10 months after last playing for the national team at the AFC Asian Cup in January. He has recovered from his anterior cruciate ligament injury.The Indian team has played 10 matches so far in the year, losing six of them and drawing four. They have so far played three games under Manolo, who was appointed head coach in July in place of Igor Stimac, and lost once while drawing twice.India drew against Mauritius and lost 0-3 to Syria in the Intercontinental Cup in September at the Gachibowli Stadium, the venue of Monday's match. The team drew with Vietnam 1-1 in its last match in Nam Dinh on October 12.If the Indian team does not get a positive result on Monday, it will end the year without a win in 11 matches. Monday's match could also be India's last before the 2027 Asian Cup Qualifiers in March next year.The India-Malaysia football rivalry goes back a long way. Since their first meeting in a 1957 friendly in Kuala Lumpur, which India won 3-0, until last year's Merdeka tournament semifinal clash in which Malaysia emerged 4-2 winners, the two sides have faced each other 32 times.That's the most number of times India have played against any opponent in international football, followed by Pakistan (29 matches) and Bangladesh (28 matches).There's nothing to separate the two sides in head-to-head results. The Blue Tigers and the Harimau Malaya have won 12 matches each, while eight have ended in draws.There is also little difference in the current FIFA rankings , with India placed 125th and Malaysia 133rd.Malaysia are coming into the match on the back of a 3-1 friendly win over Laos on November 14.Both teams know each other fairly well. India have nine players from the Merdeka tournament semifinal clash last month in the current squad -- Gurpreet Singh Sandhu, Sandesh Jhingan, Mehtab Singh, Vishal Kaith, Naorem Roshan Singh, Amrinder Singh, Liston Colaco, Lallianzuala Chhangte and Suresh Singh Wangjam.On the other hand, 14 of Malaysia's 26 members were in the squad last year. That includes two of the goal-scorers -- Arif Aiman, a young winger from Johor Darul Ta'zim FC, and defender Dion Cools, who is one of their two players plying their trade outside Malaysia (at Buriram United in the Thai League 1).The other is forward Fergus Tierney, who plays for Chonburi FC in the Thai League 2.The bulk of the Malaysian squad belongs to three clubs -- Johor Darul Ta'zim FC, Terengganu FC and Kuala Lumpur City FC.Like India, Malaysia have also undergone changes in the coaching staff since last year. Manolo and his counterpart Pau Marti both hail from Spain, and know each other from their time in Barcelona.Like Manolo, Marti also took charge in July after Malaysia failed to qualify for Round 3 of the FIFA World Cup Qualifiers.""They (Malaysia) have been playing good football and it will be a tough game for both sides,"" said Manolo.","India face familiar rivals Malaysia in an international friendly football match on Monday.

Things like this are more important than football.""Almost forgotten in the aftermath of the worrying incident was the handball by Tamas Nikitscher as the ball was crossed into the Hungarian box.The referee consulted the touchline video monitor and promptly restarted play by pointing to the spot, allowing Weghorst to sweep the Netherlands in front.Denes Dibusz was the busier of the two goalkeepers as the first period wore on and had to be alert to keep out efforts from Tijjani Reijnders and Donyell Malen.In the 11th minute of added time, Dutch dominance told and Malen was clipped by Zsolt Nagy in the box.Gakpo dispatched the resulting spot-kick, sending Dibusz the wrong way and Netherlands into a two-goal lead.Right-back Dumfries sealed the Netherlands' spot in the quarters as he latched onto Malen's flick-on at the back post and fizzed a volley back into the far corner shortly after the hour.Koopmeiners marked his first international match since 2022 by nodding in a fourth in the 86th minute.Germany cemented their spot at the top of the group with a 7-0 win over Bosnia -- the heaviest in the six-year history of the Nations League.""It was good fun tonight. After a couple of goals we did the work defensively and then everything came together offensively. The more that happens, the more fun we have on the pitch,"" German attacker Jamal Musiala told UEFA's website.Musiala opened the floodgates after two minutes with a header from Joshua Kimmich 's cross.Tim Kleindienst scored his first goal for Germany in the 23rd minute and Kai Havertz made the game safe eight minutes before the break, slotting home after a slick one-two with Florian Wirtz.Wirtz then made it four on 50 minutes with a sublime swerving free-kick from wide on the left, before doubling up seven minutes later.""Seeing Flo (Wirtz's) free-kick was kind of nice but just in general everyone played well, had good moments. We're just playing good football,"" added Musiala.Substitute Leroy Sane scored Germany's sixth in the 66th minute and Kleindienst completed the rout just over 10 minutes from time as he guided home a pinpoint cross from centre-half Antonio Rudiger.The emphatic result leaves Germany five points ahead of Netherlands with only one match left to play.In Group B1, Georgia played out a 1-1 draw at home to Ukraine and stay two points ahead of the fourth-placed visitors.The Czech Republic drew 0-0 in Albania and remain top of the group on eight points, one ahead of Georgia in second and their third-placed opponents.Turkey stayed top of Group B4 with a 0-0 draw at home to Wales, while Iceland beat Montenegro 2-0.Turkey were presented with a golden opportunity to grow their two-point lead over Wales but Kerem Akturkoglu sent his 89th-minute penalty wide.","Netherlands beat Hungary 4-0 in winner-takes-all Nations League encounter.

NEW DELHI: Football legend Cristiano Ronaldo has hinted at potential retirement plans, saying he might step away from football in ""a year or two"" but remains undecided.Speaking after Portugal's emphatic 5-1 victory over Poland in the UEFA Nations League on Friday, Ronaldo shared, “I just want to enjoy the game. My plan for retirement? If it happens, it will be in a year or two... But I don’t know. I’ll be 40 soon, and I want to enjoy this moment while I still feel motivated. As soon as the motivation is gone, I’ll walk away.”The iconic forward, who turns 40 in February next year, delivered a masterclass in Porto, scoring twice to secure Portugal's place in the quarterfinals.Ronaldo's performance flourished once again in the national colours, as he netted his 134th international goal with a penalty and later added a spectacular overhead kick to bring his tally to 135.Portugal took time to break through Poland’s defence, but a second-half flurry sealed the win.Rafael Leão opened the scoring with a well-placed header, followed by Ronaldo’s composed penalty.Bruno Fernandes then unleashed a stunning long-range strike before Ronaldo set up Pedro Neto for the fourth goal.Ronaldo’s acrobatic finish in the final minutes added an exclamation point to the night.Although Poland's Dominik Marczuk scored a consolation goal, the defeat ended Poland’s quarterfinal hopes.For Portugal, the result ensured not only a spot in the last eight but also placement in Pot 1 for the 2026 World Cup qualifying draw.As Ronaldo contemplates his footballing future, his performance against Poland reaffirms his status as a living legend. Whether he retires soon or extends his illustrious career, Ronaldo’s impact on the game remains indelible.","Cristiano Ronaldo says he might retire in ""a year or two"" but remains undecided.

Spain roll on

PARIS: Cristiano Ronaldo scored twice as Portugal thrashed Poland 5-1 thanks to a rampant second-half display on Friday to reach the Nations League quarterfinals, while already-qualified Spain beat Denmark.Roberto Martinez's Portugal wrapped up top spot in Group A1 with a game to spare, securing their place in the next round in March.France, Germany and Italy are also already through to the last eight.Poland were the better side early on but failed to take their chances in Porto and the home side made them pay, netting four times in the last 20 minutes.""We couldn't impose ourselves on the game in the first half,"" said Portugal goalscorer Rafael Leao. ""(Coach) Roberto Martinez's approach in the locker room was important; it was the key to changing the pressure at half-time.""Ronaldo volleyed over from close range shortly before the interval, as Portugal failed to register a shot on target in the first half.Dominik Marczuk almost broke the deadlock in the 58th minute, but Portugal goalkeeper Diogo Costa produced a brilliant fingertip save to deny him.The hosts broke from the resulting corner to score less than 60 seconds later, as Leao powered forward before finding Nuno Mendes, then continuing his run to meet the Paris Saint-Germain full-back's cross with a powerful header.Portugal were awarded a penalty when Diogo Dalot's strike flicked off Jakub Kiwior's hand at point-blank range and was saved by Marcin Bulka.Ronaldo stepped up to dink home a 'Panenka' spot-kick.That goal ended any hopes Poland had of staging a comeback and Fernandes added a third for Portugal with 10 minutes left, crashing the ball in off the crossbar from just outside the box.Pedro Neto also got on the scoresheet, collecting Ronaldo's pass and rifling past Bulka at his near post.There was still time for Ronaldo to double his tally and move onto 135 international goals, acrobatically volleying home Vitinha's cross from close range in the 87th minute.Marczuk drilled in a consolation for Poland, but they can no longer qualify for the knock-out stages and will be relegated if they lose to Scotland next week.In the other match in the group, Scotland gave their hopes of avoiding the drop a massive boost as John McGinn scored a late winner in a 1-0 victory over 10-man Croatia.Petar Sucic was sent off in the first half, but Croatia almost hung on for the point they needed to qualify with Portugal, only for McGinn to strike in the 86th minute.European champions Spain stayed unbeaten in Group A4 with a 2-1 win over Denmark in Copenhagen.Luis de la Fuente's visitors started strongly and went close to a 13th-minute opener when the in-form Ayoze Perez rattled the crossbar.Spain took an early lead after Denmark carelessly gave the ball away on the edge of their own box.Perez played in Mikel Oyarzabal who took an excellent first touch and slipped the ball past goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel and in at the near post.Villarreal forward Perez, who only made his international debut in June, doubled Spain's advantage with a low, left-footed finish into the bottom corner after being picked out by Dani Olmo.Gustav Isaksen pulled one back for Denmark late on, pouncing on a terrible mix-up between Fabian Ruiz and 'keeper David Raya.""A very, very happy night for me (with a goal and an assist), but the most important thing is going through top of the group,"" Perez told uefa.com.The other game in Group A4 saw Switzerland relegated by Aleksa Terzic's late equaliser in a 1-1 draw with Serbia.Romania's Group C2 game against Kosovo in Bucharest was suspended in injury time and then abandoned with the game goalless after the visiting players walked off the pitch following chants of ""Serbia"" from the home fans.""The UEFA Nations League match between Romania and Kosovo has been abandoned. UEFA will communicate further information in due course,"" said governing body UEFA on its website.In League D, San Marino kept their hopes of an unlikely promotion alive as Nicola Nanni scored an injury-time penalty to grab a 1-1 draw with Gibraltar.",Cristiano Ronaldo scores twice as Portugal thrash Poland 5-1.

Choosing 22 players from 580 in a space of a few days was the biggest challenge, says coach Nallappan Mohanraj

CHENNAI: The men’s football scene in Tamil Nadu has been far from ideal in the last six years. With the non-conduct of the CFA leagues since 2018 due to the long-standing dispute between the Tamil Nadu Football Association (TFA) and Chennai Football Association (CFA) – they were hosted without recognition in 2022 – the local players have been struggling for game time.In a bid to sustain their careers and make a living out of the sport, many TN footballers have been forced to ply their trade in other state leagues. The grim situation has severely impacted TN’s performances in the Santosh Trophy (National Championship), where the state team has been a mere participant in the last few years.Not much has changed in TN football in recent times, but newly-appointed head coach Nallappan Mohanraj is optimistic about restoring pride in the upcoming Santosh Trophy. TN have been pitted alongside Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Andhra Pradesh and 2022-23 champs Karnataka in Group G and will play their pool matches in Anantapur from Friday to Tuesday. As only one team will qualify from the group for the final round, the competition is going to be tough.""I played in the Santosh Trophy as a youngster and captained the team as well. Being with TN in my first assignment as a head coach is something memorable. I love being put in tough situations; staying comfortable makes me uncomfortable. I have always wanted to do something good while being put in a tough situation,"" Mohanraj, a former India defender, told TOI.""I had to assess about 580 players in just three days of the trials, so I do not know if they were able to show their full potential in the little time they got. I might have missed out on picking a promising player. I do not know when these players (22 members in the final squad) last played 90 minutes in a match, so I had to decide which aspect I needed to give more importance to – fitness or tactics. It has been a huge challenge, but I have been trying to find solutions,"" said Mohanraj, who had worked with the India U-23 and U-20 teams.Mohanraj can rely on the experience of Ajith Kumar, Lijo Francis, B Sriram, Sinivasan Pandiyan and Alexander Romario Jesuraj, players who have competed in the top-two tiers of Indian football . ""I hardly had 10 days to work with the group. Adding experience while building a team is important; that is why I have opted to have at least one senior player in every area of the pitch. There has to be a good balance between youth and experience,"" added Mohanraj.Despite not having the best of build-ups, the chief coach is focused on the target. ""Our goal is to take TN to the final round. We did not have time to implement my philosophy, so I did not want to complicate our tactics. The boys know what I expect from them.

Fritz's revenge chance

Jannik Sinner has his first ATP Finals crown firmly in his sights after crushing Casper Ruud 6-1, 6-2 on Saturday to set up a title decider with Taylor Fritz , the man he beat to win the US Open two months ago.Roared on by a partisan home crowd in Turin, Sinner extended his winning streak to 10 matches with another dominating display which showed why he is the first Italian to top the ATP's end-of-season world rankings.The 23-year-old has reacted to losing last year's final to Novak Djokovic by displacing the Serbian tennis icon at the top of the game, winning seven tournaments this season including his debut Grand Slam victory at the Australian Open before triumphing in New York in September.Sinner barely gave Ruud time to breathe as he rattled off the first three games and took the first set in half an hour, before sweeping to a comprehensive victory.""It's a great, great feeling. It's really special playing here,"" said Sinner.""It's a really important tournament, last year we lost the final, this year we've got a chance to try again and do better than we did last season.""But regardless of how it goes tomorrow it's been an emotional week with some great moments.""Ruud, who hadn't played Sinner for three years before Saturday, compared the shots he faced to ""rockets"" and was struck by how much he has improved.""You feel like unless you hit a ball with really good depth or close to the sidelines, and even if you hit close to the sidelines but not fast enough, he's going to rip it back at you,"" Ruud told reporters.""I got to practice with him here earlier leading up to the tournament.

James Blake was the last American to reach the final in 2006.Fritz could potentially have the opportunity to avenge his loss to Sinner in the US Open final, should the Italian advance to the championship match.The third set was a closely contested affair, with both players squandering numerous breakpoint opportunities. However, Fritz maintained his composure in the tiebreak to secure his place in the final.Sinner, the home favourite, will be backed by a passionate crowd as he vies for his first ATP Finals title. The Italian has had an exceptional year, winning seven tournaments, including his maiden Grand Slam victories at the Australian and US Opens.Despite losing last year's final to Novak Djokovic , Sinner has already secured the distinction of becoming the first Italian to top the ATP year-end rankings.However, Sinner's season has been marred by controversy after twice testing positive for traces of the banned substance clostebol in March.While initially cleared by the International Tennis Integrity Agency, the World Anti-Doping Agency appealed in late September, seeking a potential two-year ban for the Italian.Regardless of the outcome, the ATP Finals final promises to be a captivating encounter, with Fritz aiming to etch his name in American tennis history and Sinner striving to cap off a remarkable season amidst the backdrop of an ongoing doping case.",Taylor Fritz beats Alexander Zverev to reach ATP Finals final in Turin.

BENGALURU: Prajnesh Gunneswaran climbed to a career-best No.75 on the ATP Rankings five years ago, in what was his second innings in tennis.The 35-year-old, forced to listen to the rickety tunes of a creaking frame, particularly a troublesome left wrist, bid adieu to the sport on Friday. Gunneswaran made the announcement on social media, some 20-months after he played his last tournament, an ATP Challenger in Pune.The gifted left-hander said, ""I played without being able to up my intensity for a while, managing the injury, but my ranking kept dropping. The more I played, the more sure I became that I didn’t want to do this in-between thing, where I was unable to raise the intensity of my play.""Gunneswaran celebrated his 35th birthday on Tuesday. ""It was not a decision I made overnight,"" he said. ""I always knew that when I decided to go, I didn’t want to leave with regrets. That’s why I took so much time before making the decision.""The Chennai-based pro’s tennis journey has played out in two parts. Gunneswaran was ranked outside the 1500-mark at the age of 26. A series of injuries – recurring stress fracture of both knees – kept him on the sidelines. When relatively pain-free, Gunneswaran decided to get back on the road for a last dance. His father, the late SG Prabhakaran, whose deep pockets allowed his only child to return to the Tour, was his biggest cheerleader. Gunneswaran’s knees held. He played one season, tried another and then another. From 1500-plus in the rankings in the summer of 2015 to a place in the world’s top-75, in April 2019.The India No.1 enjoyed his best season that year. He started by qualifying for the main draw of the Australian Open and went on to play the main draw of the other three majors, besides making the round of 32 in Indian wells, beating the 18th ranked Nikolas Basilashvili enroute, for his best win by way of rankings. His other top-50 triumph came against Denis Shapovalov (ranked 23 at the time).Gunneswaran has no definite plans for the future but is sure he will be involved with tennis. ""All of us who have made it to this level, have had to shift out of the country to train,"" said Gunneswaran.""Every program we’ve had in this country has had some success, from BATT -- Leander Paes and Somdev Devvarman – to the other ventures. We need to do something on a big scale, so that our players do not have to go outside to train,"" he said. ""China and Japan have been doing it for a while. Either we go their way and get the best coaches to India for a period of five-ten years or we use the players we have, put them back in the system to get results.""",Prajnesh Gunneswaran announced his retirement from tennis on Friday.

Smaller badminton academies producing champions at junior level in India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/badminton/smaller-badminton-academies-producing-champions-at-junior-level-in-india/articleshow/115267276.cms,"Badminton (X Photo)

Jaipur: Players from Pullela Gopichand Badminton Academy (PGBA) and Prakash Padukone Badminton Academy (PPBA) have dominated the national tournaments for years now. In the last two decades, most titles in sub-junior ranking tournaments were claimed by either PGBA or PPBA shuttlers.However, a major change seems to be happening in India’s badminton scenario. Smaller centres/academies with limited resources have started challenging players from the formidable academies and beating them.In the All India Sub-Junior (Under-15 and Under-17) Ranking tournament, which concluded at the Sawai Mansingh Indoor Stadium here on Tuesday, not a single title was won by powerhouses of Indian badminton. All the 10 titles were claimed by non-PGBA and PPBA shuttlers. More than 30 players were in action on the ninth and last day of the competition, and barring a couple of players, all finalists were from smaller academies.Just like cricket, badminton is witnessing a huge shift in talent catchment areas beyond Hyderabad and Bengaluru. Around two-three decades ago, most of the Indian cricket team’s players came from Mumbai, Delhi, Bangalore or other big centres. Now, several cricketers from smaller towns are making the cut.Dev Ruparelia, the U-17 boys’ singles winner here, hails from Palghar, a town in the Konkan division of Maharashtra. The top seed defeated Jagsher Singh Khangurra 21-18, 21-14 in the final. Eighth seed Jagsher belongs to Punjab and trains under former Indian shuttler Akshit Mahajan.“I started with Nitesh Badminton Academy in Palghar and stuck with it despite getting regular offers from the big centres. I train for nearly eight hours a day and am happy with the results. I don’t have any plans to shift anywhere as I get the best coaching in my hometown,” said Dev, who is ranked No. 2 in the U-17 boys singles. The promising shuttler has represented the junior India team twice.Similarly, Parul Choudhary, the champion in the U-17 girls’ singles, hails from Churu, a city in the desert region of Rajasthan. The India No. 3 trains in Gurgaon under coach Manish Sharma. The southpaw won back-to-back titles after she pocketed her maiden crown in the last All India ranking tournament in Vijayawada.“I get personal attention from my coaches. In the last one year or so, I have improved a lot and also became the first Rajasthani player to represent the junior Indian team. I want to achieve results in the U-19 as well as the women’s singles in the future,” said Parul, a niece of Paralympic javelin legend Devendra Jhajharia.Parul’s coach Manish Sharma admitted that the domination of big centres is slowly getting over and it’s a good sign that the game is growing rapidly in remote places.“Parents now want their kids to train individually rather than in a big bunch of players. Players and parents have now realised that one-to-one coaching is the need of the hour. We train Parul individually with a set of coaches and support staff. Several players of PGBA and PPBA have left them. Some of them have joined BAI’s National Centre of Excellence in Guwahati,” said Sharma.A senior BAI official said he is pleased with the results of the Jaipur tournament because it marked the beginning of a paradigm shift in national badminton. “The positive side of it is that we are no longer dependent on the two big centres. Now, the smaller academies are producing winners and coming out of the shadows of powerful academies. It will ultimately benefit Indian badminton,” said the BAI official.","Players from Pullela Gopichand Badminton Academy (PGBA) have dominated the national tournaments for years now.

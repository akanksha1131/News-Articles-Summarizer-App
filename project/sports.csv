Poll Who was the standout player in the final Test match? Mohammed Siraj Prasidh Krishna Shubman Gill Other

Former England captain Nasser Hussain said it would have been a travesty if England had won the Test series 3-1 and added that Mohammed Siraj taking the final wicket was a fitting end to an exhilarating series.“The final scoreline was well and truly deserved by India, and it was very fitting for Siraj to get the final wicket,” Hussain told Sky Cricket.“It would have been a travesty had England won the series 3-1. India deserved to make it 2-2 for the amount of good cricket they’ve played in this series.”The tireless Mohammed Siraj’s warrior spirit steered India to a series-levelling six-run victory over England in the fifth and final Test on Monday, bringing a fitting end to one of the most intensely fought and drama-filled contests in recent memory.With four wickets in hand and just 35 runs to get, England held the edge at the start of the final day. But the gladiator in Siraj made life miserable for the opposition batters from the very first ball.In the end, his fiery effort—well supported by Prasidh Krishna at the other end—left England short by the narrowest of margins and allowed India to sign off with a 2-2 draw in the high-pressure five-match series.The decision to call off play early on Day 4, following a brief spell of rain, drew criticism from the likes of Stuart Broad and Michael Vaughan.However, it seemed fitting that the decider extended into the final day, with both teams battling tooth and nail until the very end.With all five Tests going into the final day, Hussain also highlighted why the “Big Three” — India, Australia, and England — must safeguard the future of Test cricket.“Why do people knock this format? It’s just so wonderful. But I’m afraid other countries don’t have the luxuries that England, India, and Australia enjoy,” Hussain said.“The crowds throughout the whole series were incredible — pretty much sold out every day. Even today, there was a sell-out crowd for just 40 minutes of play.“Not every country has that privilege, so England, India, and Australia must keep an eye on the future of Test match cricket. If we let this go, we’re doing the game a disservice. We need to keep pushing it forward,” he added.","Former England captain Nasser Hussain says it would have been a travesty if England had won the Test series 3-1.

Poll Do you agree with Sunil Gavaskar's views on workload management for cricketers? Yes, they should prioritize playing for the country. No, players need to manage their workload.

Legendary India cricketer Sunil Gavaskar has hit back at the idea of ""workload management,"" citing the example of Indian Army jawans who patrol the borders in the harshest conditions.“If you're going to succumb to people talking about workload, then you’ll never have your best players on the field,"" Gavaskar told India Today.""You’ve got to get them to a situation where you say, 'Hello, you are playing for your country, and when you're playing for your country, you have to forget the aches and pains in your muscles. That’s what happens on the border.'""Do you think the jawans complain about the cold or the conditions? They are out there, ready to give their lives for the country. You must give your very best for the nation.""Don’t worry about minor aches and pains. What did Rishabh Pant show you? He came out to bat with a fracture. That’s the kind of spirit you want to see from your team.""That’s what is expected. Don’t be held back by small injuries. It is an honour, given to you among 140 crore people, to represent India. You are incredibly lucky, and you should not take that lightly.""And we’ve seen this attitude in Siraj—five Test matches, bowling non-stop,"" he said.England, set a target of 374 to win, lost a nail-biting encounter by just six runs, with Siraj returning innings figures of 5/104 as India ended a rollercoaster campaign level at 2-2.The hosts resumed Monday’s final day on 339/6, needing just 35 more runs for a win that would have secured a 3-1 series victory.But they had no answer to the enduring skill of fast bowler Mohammed Siraj , who featured in all five Tests.He dismantled England with a brilliant burst of 3/9 in 25 balls, ending the match in style by knocking over Gus Atkinson’s off-stump.","Former India cricketer Sunil Gavaskar has hit back at the idea of ""workload management"" He cited the example of Indian Army jawans who patrol the borders in the harshest conditions.

England head coach Brendon McCullum hailed Mohammed Siraj 's performance in the fifth and final Test at The Oval and described the game as one of the ""all-time best Test matches."" India clinched the decisive fifth Test by 6 runs - their smallest victory margin - to level the series at 2-2.“That is the best five-match Test series I have ever been a part of or witnessed,” McCullum told“It just oscillated so much throughout the six weeks, and I felt it had everything. There was hostility at times, camaraderie at times, great cricket at times, and some average cricket as well, because of the pressure both teams were put under.”“We knew it was going to be hard coming into the series. We knew they were going to test us physically and mentally. I think it tested both teams more than we expected. It was a cracking series to be a part of.”England arrived on the final day of the five-game series needing just 35 runs with four wickets in hand to complete a remarkable chase of 374 but were blown away on a morning of unbearable tension.Mohammed Siraj took three of the four wickets to fall and finished with figures of 5/104.“When [Mohammed] Siraj took that final wicket, as much as I was disappointed, I had admiration for him — for the fight he’s got as a cricketer and the way he was able to do what he did.”“I think 2-2 was a fair reflection. Playing all five days of all five Tests becomes a mental exertion, and I thought the way they dealt with that was impressive. Obviously, we had to call in fresh legs for this last Test match. You know that fatigue is coming, but you don’t know what it’s like until it hits you.”“It is the hardest thing in cricket — playing a five-match series and being tested as much as you are, for as long as you are. It tests you not just as a sportsperson but as a character because it questions how much you want it. As a fan of the game, I thought it was an unbelievable spectacle.”","Mohammed Siraj took three of the four wickets to fall and finished with figures of 5/104.

CHENNAI: Following the retirements of Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli from the Test arena, Indian cricket has entered a new phase. Rohit and Kohli’s contributions had long been central to the team’s success in the longest format. But, in their absence, a young crop made its mark and showed promise in the India-England series.India’s not-so-experienced batting line-up in English conditions rose to the challenge, with Shubman Gill leading from the front in his first series as captain. South African great Jonty Rhodes believes that India’s incredible depth has both positive and negative impact.“I think India’s biggest disadvantage is the fact that they have got so many players. It is not just the IPL, every state has its own league and it is a great platform for young players to showcase their skill. In India, it is so difficult to know when to retire. When you see young prodigious talent churned out and if you do not give them a chance, you possibly could not lose them but the frustrations will grow. It is kind of a double-edged sword. It is great to see the young players stepping up,” Jonty said, after the opening ceremony of the Asian Surfing Championships in Mamallapuram.One such player who made a strong impact was Washington Sundar . The 25-year-old all-rounder played a vital role with both bat and ball. “Washington has played a lot of limited-overs cricket and it is amazing to see how he played in England. We have seen the importance of all-rounders and there are exciting times ahead,” Jonty, who is the brand ambassador of the Surfing Federation of India, added.There has been quite a bit of talk about the competitiveness in Test cricket, with matches often ending in less than five days. However, the fight in the India-England series came as a pleasant surprise, as the first four Tests went till the fifth day. “When T20 started, everyone thought that Test cricket would be at risk. But I think we have seen the level of skill now added with this bravery and everyone talks about ‘Bazball’. Rishabh Pant is getting himself into all sorts of interesting positions when he is playing and that just makes it exciting.“If a five-match series comes down to Day 4 in the fifth Test, that is what you want to see. Every single Test in the series had its ups and downs, which kept people engaged throughout.”WTC win an incredible feat for SAAfter multiple heartbreaks in the knockout stages of ICC events, South Africa finally seized their moment by clinching the World Test Championship title. “It was interesting because we did not win trophies for a long time. There was criticism from coaches and commentators, mainly the commentators asking who have South Africa played. It is fine because sadly, we do not play a lot of Test cricket. Test cricket is big business and if it is not against Australia or India or England, it is a draining business.“It has been disappointing how little Test cricket the South Africans get to play. I think it is an incredible feat (WTC win), considering the limited time they spend in the format. Hopefully, now that they have won an ICC trophy, the shackles will be released.”","South African great Jonty Rhodes believes that India’s incredible depth has both positive and negative impact. “It is so difficult to know when to retire.

India pulled off a stunning six-run victory in the final Test at The Oval to level the five-match series 2-2, capping off one of the most fiercely contested battles in recent memory.

T ouring England is always one of the toughest assignments for any Indian captain. Swing-friendly conditions, long summers, and hostile crowds test both skill and temperament. Here's a look at how five of India’s most successful Test captains performed on their maiden tours to England as leaders.On his first Test tour to England as captain, Shubman Gill returned home with plenty of pride and accolades. Tasked with leading a relatively inexperienced side in the absence of several senior players, Gill rose to the occasion both as a batter and leader. The 24-year-old piled up a stunning 754 runs across five Tests, narrowly missing out on Sunil Gavaskar’s Indian record for most runs in a series. More importantly, his composed leadership helped India bounce back from a 1-2 deficit to draw the series 2-2. The dramatic six-run win in the final Test at The Oval turned the tide, and Gill was rightly named India’s Player of the Series.When Virat Kohli led India in England for the first time in 2018, the team ended up losing the five-match series 1-4. However, the scoreline didn’t fully reflect how closely contested the games were.Kohli himself was in top form, finishing as the leading run-scorer of the series with 593 runs. India had their chances but failed to capitalise on key moments, allowing England to seize control.Dhoni’s first tour as captain to England in 2011 was one to forget. India, ranked No. 1 in Tests at the time, were thoroughly outplayed. The team suffered a 0-4 whitewash, with neither the batting nor bowling clicking. Other than Rahul Dravid ’s solo brilliance with the bat, India had little to cheer about during the series.In 2002, Sourav Ganguly led India to a commendable 1-1 draw on English soil. It was India's best series result in England since 1986. The series was memorable for Rahul Dravid’s 602-run tally and Anil Kumble’s 14 wickets. Ganguly’s aggressive leadership and belief in his young players laid the foundation for future overseas successes.Azharuddin’s first series in England as captain came in 1990. The three-match series saw India lose the opener before drawing the next two, resulting in a 0-1 defeat. Despite the setback, the series helped shape Azhar's leadership for the years ahead.Rohit never led India in a Test series in England.",Shubman Gill captained India on his first Test tour to England as captain.

NEW DELHI: India's T20I captain Suryakumar Yadav shared his thoughts on the thrilling Oval Test win over England, saying it felt to him like India had won the series 3-2. In a pulsating contest that went down to the wire, outstanding spells from Mohammed Siraj and Prasidh Krishna helped India secure a dramatic six-run victory, levelling the five-match series 2-2 and denying the hosts a home series win.With this result, the Shubman Gill-led Indian side has kicked off a new era with great promise, ending the series on a high.""It was a lot of fun. I am feeling as if we have won 3-2. Whatever changes were made, whoever made their debut, everyone did well. This is the effort of the whole unit. I am very happy for the team. Whenever the team performs, obviously, it feels good,"" Suryakumar said.In the match, after being put in to bat, India were reduced to 153/6. A 58-run partnership between Karun Nair (57 off 109 balls, with eight fours) and Washington Sundar (26 off 55 balls, with three fours) was the highlight of the innings as India were bowled out for 224. Gus Atkinson starred with a five-wicket haul, while Josh Tongue chipped in with 3/57.England’s first innings was kept in check by four-wicket hauls from Siraj (4/86) and Prasidh Krishna (4/62). Despite a strong 92-run opening stand between Zak Crawley (64 off 57 balls, with 14 fours) and Ben Duckett (43 off 38 balls, with five fours and two sixes), and a half-century from Harry Brook (53 off 64 balls, with five fours and a six), England were restricted to 247, gaining a slim lead of 23 runs.In their second outing with the bat, India posted a formidable 396, thanks to key performances from Yashasvi Jaiswal (118 off 164 balls, with 14 fours and two sixes), Akash Deep (66 off 94 balls, with 12 fours), Ravindra Jadeja (53 off 77 balls, with five fours), and Washington Sundar (53 off 46 balls, with four fours and four sixes). Sundar played a crucial role in the 10th wicket stand alongside Prasidh Krishna, who didn’t score but held firm at one end while Sundar provided the fireworks.This gave India a commanding 373-run lead, setting England a daunting target of 374 to clinch the series.India started strong with the ball, reducing England to 106/3. However, centuries from Harry Brook (111 off 98 balls, with 14 fours and two sixes) and Joe Root (105 off 152 balls, with 12 fours) built a 195-run partnership for the fourth wicket and threatened to take the match away. England were cruising at 317/4 on day four, but a late surge by Siraj (5/104) and Krishna (4/126) turned the tide in India’s favour. England were bowled out for 367, just six runs short of the target.The 2-2 result is a fitting reflection of a fiercely contested series. The Shubman Gill era has begun with resilience and intent, offering a glimpse of a promising future for Indian Test cricket.","India captain Suryakumar Yadav says it felt like India had won the series 3-2.

In a dramatic and worrying development for Indian football, Indian Super League (ISL) side Bengaluru FC have announced the indefinite suspension of salaries for its first-team players and staff, including iconic striker and former national team captain Sunil Chhetri The decision comes amid escalating uncertainty around the future of the ISL, which remains suspended following an unresolved standoff between Football Sports Development Limited (FSDL) and the All India Football Federation (AIFF).Bengaluru FC took to social media on Monday to deliver the difficult news to fans and stakeholders, stating, “In view of the uncertainty surrounding the future of the Indian Super League season, Bengaluru Football Club has taken what is a very difficult decision of indefinitely suspending the salaries of players and staff belonging to the First Team. Running and sustaining a football club in India has always been an uphill climb, one that we have put everything aside and made, season after season. ”The club emphasised the emotional toll the situation is taking on the team and their families, adding, “However, the lack of clarity on the League's future leaves us with no choice but to take this step. The future and well-being of our players, staff, and their families is of utmost importance to us, and we are in touch with them as we wait for a resolution.”While this suspension applies to first-team operations, the club has assured that its youth development programmes and grassroots operations remain unaffected: “The Club remains committed to growing and developing the sport and our operations with our youth teams – men and women – and BFC Soccer Schools remain unaffected by this decision. We urge the AIFF and FSDL to end this impasse swiftly. The uncertainty benefits no one, and a prompt resolution is vital for the future of Indian football. ”This move comes just two weeks after Sunil Chhetri himself raised concerns about the bleak outlook for Indian football. On July 16, he wrote on X: “It began with worrying about how I am on borrowed time with what I have left in the tank. But speaking with players from across clubs, I’ve realised that my selfish problem isn’t as important.“Everybody in the Indian football ecosystem is worried, hurt, scared about the uncertainty we are faced with.”The AIFF is expected to meet with club CEOs soon in an attempt to find common ground and salvage what remains of the season.",Bengaluru FC have announced the indefinite suspension of salaries for its first- team players and staff.

Poll Do you think Son Heung-min made the right decision to leave Tottenham? Yes, it's time for a new challenge No, he should have stayed

Departing Tottenham captain Son Heung-min was in tears and his teammates threw him in the air on an emotional evening in his native South Korea on Sunday.Spurs drew 1-1 with Newcastle in a pre-season friendly in Seoul but that was secondary to the farewell for the 33-year-old attacker.There was also the sorry sight of James Maddison being stretchered off with what manager Thomas Frank said ""was most likely a bad injury"" to his knee.In what could have been his final game for the north Londoners, Son played 65 minutes but did not score at Seoul World Cup Stadium, a day after announcing his decision to leave Tottenham this summer after a decade.He left the pitch to a thunderous ovation from nearly 65,000 fans, hugging his teammates and even his opponents.The South Korea captain was caught offside twice in the early going, as his teammates tried to create opportunities for him, but he did not really assert himself on the match otherwise.Son was replaced in the 65th minute by Mohammed Kudus and he walked off in tears as thousands of fans chanted his name.""I didn't think I was going to cry at first,"" Son said.""But after hearing a few words from my teammates, leaving the club I've spent so much time with felt really tough.""I felt really, really happy playing this match. Thanks to my fans, my teammates and also my opponents, I've had an unforgettable day.""Son, who has been linked with LAFC in Major League Soccer, declined to reveal his next destination, saying: ""Nothing has been finalised.""Frank said he enjoyed the ""unbelievable, beautiful scenes"" Son had with players from both sides on his way off the pitch.Newcastle boss Eddie Howe said his players' reaction to the end of Son's night had not been planned.""I think it was very instinctive from the players,"" Howe said.""I think that speaks volumes for him as a person and him as a footballer that both teams recognise the way he's played the game.""Brennan Johnson's right-footed strike opened the scoring for Tottenham in the fourth minute, and the Welsh forward paid homage to Son by mimicking the South Korean star's camera celebration.Harvey Barnes levelled in the 38th minute, beating Antonin Kinsky with a right-footed shot that went in off the post.","Tottenham drew 1-1 with Newcastle in a pre-season friendly in Seoul.

(Screenshot)

The Leagues Cup disciplinary committee has banned Lionel Messi's bodyguard Yassine Cheuko from all technical areas for the remainder of the tournament through August 31, and imposed an undisclosed fine on Inter Miami following an incident where Cheuko entered the field to intervene in a postgame confrontation between Inter Miami and Atlas players on July 30.The disciplinary action came after Cheuko, wearing a black Miami T-shirt, ran onto the field and physically pushed away Atlas players who were gathered following Inter Miami's 2-1 victory over Atlas.The Leagues Cup disciplinary committee released an official statement addressing the incident: ""After the July 30 Inter Miami CF vs. Club Atlas match, a member of Inter Miami's club delegation displayed improper conduct by entering restricted areas without an official event credential. In accordance with the Leagues Cup 2025 Tournament Regulations, the Disciplinary Committee has suspended the individual involved from all technical areas for the remainder of Leagues Cup 2025 and issued an undisclosed fine to Inter Miami CF. ""Atlas defender Matheus Doria expressed concerns about Cheuko's intervention on the field: ""We already know that our board works very well and will take care of the issue. I understand that Messi's bodyguard is there to protect Messi from a possible entry by a fan, I don't know, but between players, he doesn't have that permission.""Doria further elaborated on the situation: ""It's not up to us to say much or give our opinion on the matter, but the board and those in charge of the Leagues Cup have already seen it and will take charge of what can and can't be done because as long as it protects not only Messi but the other players, and the physical integrity of the players who are there, that's fine. But if it's for other issues, no one will agree, but it's not up to me to do anything. ""Cheuko has been working as Messi's security personnel since the footballer's time at Paris Saint-Germain. Previous reports suggesting Cheuko was a former Navy SEAL or professional MMA fighter have been found to be incorrect.This incident is not the first time Cheuko has entered the field to protect Messi . He has previously intercepted pitch invaders during matches, demonstrating his commitment to ensuring Messi's security.In April 2025, Inter Miami had already taken action regarding Cheuko's field presence by prohibiting him from being on the sideline during MLS matches.

From Mumbai suburbs to Indian football’s highest seat: Story of Khalid Jamil,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/top-stories/from-mumbai-suburbs-to-indian-footballs-highest-seat-story-of-khalid-jamil/articleshow/123056590.cms,"Khalid Jamil

No cutting corners

Understanding the player

The quiet coach

Long before Khalid Jamil became Indian football’s headline appointment—long before his name was etched in I-League history as the architect of Aizawl FC’s fairytale title run, and long before he coached in the ISL— he was just a young midfielder at Air India , lingering behind after training.He’d buy tea and samosas for his coach, Bimal Ghosh, pull out a chair, and request that he stay back a little longer. Just one more hour, he’d ask. Just one more drill. And then he’d train like a madman. “He used to come early and would be the last to leave,” Ghosh recalls. “I’d be sipping chai and watching him run, trying shooting drills. I’ve never seen anyone train like that.” That madness—disciplined, unrelenting, and almost monk-like in its obsession— has now taken Khalid Jamil to Indian football’s highest seat: Head coach of the national team. And few appointments have felt as honest, and as earned, as this one.A commanding central midfielder, he plied his trade with Air India and Mahindra United, known for his nononsense style, leadership, and consistency. Former teammate Godfrey Pereira, who shared the Air India dressing room with him and later did AFC ALicense coaching alongside him, remembers him as the most disciplined man on the field.“He used to travel all the way from Mira Road to Kalina— never late, never missing training,” Godfrey says. “And as a coach, he’s carried that same spirit. ” What sets Khalid apart is that he never took shortcuts. He built Mumbai FC from the ground up, and shocked the country in 2017 by leading Aizawl FC—a club with one of the league’ssmallest budgets—to an ILeague title.Perhaps Jamil’s biggest strength is his ability to understand players—not just their strengths and weaknesses, but their psychology.Steven Dias, who played with him at Air India and Mahindra and now serves as his assistant coach at Jamshedpur FC, describes him as a coach who never overburdens players. “He understands every player’s capacity,” Dias says. “For instance, when I played under him at Mumbai FC, he gave me complete freedom in attack. He didn’t ask me to defend. That’s his genius.”Jamil doesn’t come from a PR-polished world. He isn’t active on social media. He speaks little—and when he does, it’s straight to the point.“He doesn’t say thank you or sorry,” Godfrey chuckles. “He expects results.” And perhaps that’s why he stands out. His appointment to the top post is also a huge boost for homegrown coaches.","Khalid Jamil is the new head coach of the Indian national team.

AHMEDABAD: When 18-yearold Khushbu Saroj walks on to the pitch at Thuwunna Stadium in Yangon on Aug 6 to face Indonesia in the AFC U-20 Women’s Asian Cup Qualifiers, she’ll carry more than just a jersey with the Indian tricolour — she’ll carry a dream that once seemed impossible.The daughter of a humble gardener, Khushbu has been named in India’s 23-member squad for the continental tournament. Hailing from Ahmedabad, she is joined by Tapi district’s Shubhangi Singh as the two Gujarat players in the squad. For Khushbu, this is not just a football match — it’s a moment of quiet triumph against years of doubt, social resistance, and hardship.“My father works as a gardener in people’s homes. He used to be ridiculed by his friends for letting me leave the house in shorts to play football,” Khushbu recalls. “He would often tell me, ‘ Kuch bhi nahi rakha in sab cheezo mein ’ (There’s no future in such things). But my mother and sisters never gave up on me. They were my strength.”Her journey began in the narrow lanes of Ahmedabad, where she first kicked a ball after watching seniors play at her school. What started as curiosity quickly turned into a passion. But the path wasn’t easy. Her father’s reluctance and societal judgment weighed heavily on the family.Still, Khushbu persisted.It wasn’t until she earned a spot in the Gujarat state team that her father’s attitude began to shift. “When I finally wore the India jersey and returned from Thailand after my first international tournament, my parents came to receive me. They were filled with pride,” she says, a smile audible in her voice.Her coach at Kahaani FC, Lalita Saini, played a pivotal role in her rise. “Lalita ma’am was like a second mother. She guided me in everything – diet, discipline, mental strength. When I got injured in 2022 and my parents asked if I should quit the sport, Lalita ma’am told me injuries are just part of a player’s life. The real story is in making a comeback.”Khushbu’s father’s words today are a stark contrast to the doubts of past: “I used to stop her when she went for training. Today, I’m proud of her.”Her mother’s eyes well up as she added, “People used to mock her. Today feels like a dream. We never imagined our daughter would play for India.”From Ahmedabad to Yangon, Khushbu Saroj’s story is one of perseverance, passion, and quiet revolution – a testament to the power of belief in oneself.",Khushbu Saroj named in India's 23-member squad for AFC U-20 Women's Asian Cup Qualifiers.

PANAJI: The All India Football Federation (AIFF) has cleared the path for Khalid Jamil to take over as coach of the national football team.Should Jamil — currently coaching Jamshedpur FC — agree to the terms offered by the AIFF in the next 24 to 48 hours, he will become the first Indian as full-time coach since Sukhvinder Singh in 2005. Two other Indians, Armando Colaco and Savio Medeira, held interim charges, following the sacking of Bob Houghton in 2011.“It was felt the federation must give an opportunity to an Indian coach,” the AIFF said after its executive committee meeting on Friday. “The members felt that since India are set to participate in the CAFA Nations Cup this month, followed by back-toback AFC Asian Cup final round qualifiers (against Singapore in October), Jamil would be a better option, since he has been working with Indian players on a regular basis. ”AIFF technical director Syed Sabir Pasha and national teams director Subrata Paul presented a SWOT analysis of all the three shortlisted coaches – Jamil, Stephen Constantine, and Stefan Tarkovic. While the mood was in favour of an Indian coach, a “strong recommendation” from technical committee chairperson and former India captain IM Vijayan helped members decide.In its presentation, AIFF said Jamil’s playing style is easy for the players to adapt, and that he is “known to create teams that are hard to score against.” An AFC pro coaching license holder since 2015, the 48-yearold has managed over 200 games in the I-League with stints at clubs like Mumbai FC, Aizawl FC – with whom he scripted a fairytale I-League triumph – East Bengal and Mohun Bagan. In the Indian Super League (ISL), now the top-tier league, he has guided NorthEast United FC and Jamshedpur to the semifinals, despite being teams with much lower budgets.Jamil’s teams are known to be disciplined and well drilled. It’s no secret either that he likes to work with a core group of players who he has trusted through his career, none of them big names or superstars.“At Mohun Bagan and East Bengal, two of the biggest clubs Khalid has managed, he was never really successful,” said Pradhyum Reddy, Dempo’s technical director who has formerly coached in both I-League and ISL. “The question is whether he can manage the egos (in the national team dressing room) or get rid of the egos.”Others feel Jamil’s lack of experience with international football can prove to be challenging.“Khalid was the best option among the three coaches who were shortlisted. But purely from a technical point of view, it’s not the best appointment,” said Reddy.Many feel the AIFF were left with no choice than make a domestic coach appointment due to the precarious state of its finances. The budgets, according to sources, have been approved only till December, when the 15-year agreement with its marketing partners comes to an end.“Without an assured annual payment of Rs 50 crore (from the marketing partners), AIFF will be left with nothing. At times like these, hiring an experienced Indian coach makes perfect sense,” said one member.AIFF sources said the plan is to offer Jamil a two-year contract with a one-year extension clause. Neither party is in favour of a dual club-andcountry role.● Youngest Indian coach to win the I-League.● Most number of matches in I-League by any coach.● First full-time Indian coach in ISL, with NorthEast United and now Jamshedpur.● Guided Aizawl FC to a historic I-League title in 2017, finishing a point ahead of Mohun Bagan.● Reached ISL semifinals with NorthEast and Jamshedpur. Super Cup finalist with East Bengal (2018) and Jamshedpur (2025).● Made his national team debut in 1997 in a SAFF Cup match against Bangladesh in Kathmandu.● Played 15 matches for India till his retirement in 2006 due to injuries.Tajikistan vs IndiaIndia vs IranAfghanistan vs IndiaSingapore vs IndiaIndia vs SingaporeBangladesh vs India","The All India Football Federation (AIFF) has cleared the path for Khalid Jamil to take over as coach of the national football team.

What’s common between the three Formula E world champions

How the three World Champions fared in Formula E Season 11

Days after Oliver Rowland lifted his Formula E World Championship trophy in London this season, an interesting trend has come to the attention of Formula E and its fans. As a coincidence, all Formula E drivers who won the Mexico City E-Prix went on to win the Formula E World Championship that season, and this has been proved right for three consecutive years.Highlighting the same since 2023, a poster of three World Champions was shared on X by Formula E with the caption, “The trend continues. Each winner of the #MexicoCityEPrix from the past three seasons has gone on to become World Champion.”The special poster features 2023 Formula E World Champion Jake Dennis from Andretti, then TAG Heuer Porsche’s Pascal Wehrlein, who won in 2024, and the new World Champion, Nissan driver Oliver Rowland. All three of them won in the Mexico E-Prix and went on to lift the winner’s trophy in the Formula E World Championship that year.Oliver Rowland had strengthened his chances of winning the Formula E World Championship this year much earlier. He was leading the Formula E Driver Standings ever since he won Part 2 of the Jeddah E-Prix, which was his second win of the season after winning the Mexico E-Prix. In the last leg, the Nissan driver got nervous for a while as Pascal Wehrlein, who was following him in the number two position, closed the gap after grabbing quite a few podiums while Rowland had a dull period.Things became serious for Rowland when he failed to finish the Round 13 race in Berlin, while Wehrlein won second spot on the podium. But he eventually managed to confirm his championship in Berlin after four wins and three more podiums.Sharing about his bad race in Berlin, Rowland had said, “I was hoping before the weekend that the outcome could be [the World Championship], but after yesterday (Saturday) and this morning (Sunday), I was more worried that it might never come.”Also Read: Oliver Rowland reacts to daughter’s sweet radio message after Formula E Championship win: “It’s amazing” Things, however, changed for Wehrlein, who was pushed to third position after Nick Cassidy made a late entry in the Formula E Driver Standings by registering three consecutive wins.

Wehrlein registered one win and five more podiums this season.Meanwhile, Andretti driver Jake Dennis finished in seventh position in the Formula E Driver Standings.

Taylor Barnard on losing top three spot in Formula E World Championship

Fans hail Taylor Barnard for his fantastic rookie season

It was Taylor Barnard’s rookie season this year, and the NEOM McLaren driver put up a fantastic performance by temporarily making it to the top three in the Formula E Driver Standings by ousting the much more experienced Porsche driver Antonio Felix Da Costa. He was, however, ousted from the top three at the London E-Prix as Jaguar’s Nick Cassidy went on to register three consecutive wins. Barnard took to Instagram to share his feelings on losing out on the top three in his first-ever season and his claim to the championship.Taking to Instagram after the London E-Prix, Barnard wrote, “London wasn’t what we hoped for, easily being the toughest weekend of our season. Taking 0 points away as a team from a doubleheader hurts, but one weekend doesn’t define the year we’ve had.”He further wrote, “As the season closes, I want to say a massive thank you to the entire team, both trackside and behind the scenes, for everything this season. Finishing P4 in the Drivers’ Championship and coming into the final weekend with a shot at runner-up is something to be proud of.”Also adding a note for teammate Sam Bird, as NEOM McLaren withdrew from Formula E after the end of the season, Barnard wrote, “@sambird_official it wasn’t the weekend you deserved either.You’ve been a huge part of my season both on and off the track, and I’m grateful for everything. You deserved more. To all the Papaya fans, thank you for the incredible support in our final race together. You always go above and beyond. ”Reacting to his post, a fan wrote, “An incredible debut season, huge congrats and excited to see where you go next!” Another said, “I know I said it the other day, but you’ve been incredible to watch this last year and a pleasure to support you in Papaya — there are many of us that can’t wait to support you in whatever you do next!” One more commented, “You were incredible all season around, Taylor. Massive congratulations. You are the future of this sport.”Recalling Barnard’s maiden pole, a fan also wrote, “Fantastic season, Taylor, we'll never forget that Monaco pole.”Also Read: Taylor Barnard looks back at rookie season at McLaren: “Every step has been unforgettable” Barnard claimed five podiums in his first full season in Formula E.

Through the early days, the good days, the bad days, and the great days, we have always felt an overwhelming amount of support from you all.”For the partners associated with the team, he wrote, “They say that ‘racing is a state of mind’, and since its inception, this team has had the privilege of working for organisations, with partners, and racing for fans who fully embrace this philosophy.This is certainly true of those at McLaren, whose passion for racing is second to none.”“My heartfelt thanks go out to everyone who has been involved: those at McLaren who backed us, the fans who supported us, and the partners who allowed us to go racing. We couldn’t have done it without you all — your trust and support have never been taken for granted,” he added.Praising the two McLaren drivers, he wrote, “Sam clinched McLaren’s first-ever fully electric win at the São Paulo E-Prix in Season 10, pulling off one of Formula E’s all-time great overtakes, before being waved across the line by none other than Emerson Fittipaldi – McLaren's first Formula 1 World Champion. While Taylor has been a rookie sensation in Season 11, securing five Formula E records, including the youngest driver to start a race, the youngest points scorer, the youngest driver to lead a lap, the youngest podium finisher, and the youngest polesitter. ”He ended the letter saying, “Some of us have been together since the day we first launched this team, while others have seamlessly fitted in along the way and flourished within the environment we have cultivated. For many, I am sure that we will cross paths again soon, but whatever the future holds for those here at Bicester, whatever path they choose to follow, I have no doubt that it will be bright. Their potential is limitless. ”Reacting to the open letter on Instagram, Taylor Barnard wrote, “It’s been an honour to wear Papaya and represent this team.” Sam Bird also dropped a heart emoji and a hands-joined-in-prayer emoji in the comments section.Also Read: Taylor Barnard looks back at rookie season at McLaren: “Every step has been unforgettable” Neither Taylor Barnard nor Sam Bird has revealed their future course of action in Formula E Season 12.

How do Formula E and ABB work together?

What do ABB and Formula E say about the partnership?

After a successful Season 11, ABB and Formula E have announced that they will continue their partnership in the upcoming season. This gives ABB another opportunity to promote its new brand positioning via the ABB FIA Formula E World Championship, along with technologies that help industries take a cleaner route.Over a period of eight seasons, the partnership with Formula E has provided ABB a platform to showcase how technology can help industries outrun challenges, engage with customers around the world, and implement its own solutions into the series to improve reliability and efficiency. The partnership extension will provide a year-round opportunity for brand-building and activation, communicating ABB and its technology solutions to new global audiences, including Formula E’s international fanbase.ABB and Formula E will also join hands to engage a new generation of fans, collaborating with unexpected influencers and content creators to tell compelling stories that make advanced electrification and automation technologies tangible and exciting.The end of the mid-race car swap, a 150kW increase in power, top speeds that are 43 percent higher, and energy recovery increasing from 15 to 50 percent indicate how far Formula E technology has come to outperform on track.ABB has also built on its technical involvement in the series, supplying the race chargers from Season 9, and introducing its ABB Ability OPTIMAX® energy management software (Season 9) and Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) technology (Season 5) to the sport.ABB Head of Brand Paco Liebrand said, “We are pleased to be continuing our partnership with Formula E which, like ABB, is striving for a leaner and cleaner future. The synergy between the two organizations, combined with the global appeal of the Championship, makes it a great platform to promote our brand positioning.”He further said, “Formula E is increasingly working with content creators, influencers, and celebrities, with initiatives such as the Evo Sessions making an impact through digital channels beyond the racing itself, which is also an essential part of ABB’s new brand strategy. Going forward, we will be enhancing the way we harness the benefits of this collaboration, ensuring the focus is on delivering content and activations that reinforce our new messaging, build familiarity, and tell the ‘Engineered to Outrun’ story. ”Formula E Chief Revenue Officer Tiziana Di Gioia said, “Our renewed partnership with ABB is a testament to the commercial power and benefit of Formula E as a global platform that drives both brand and business growth. ABB, like our wider partnership portfolio, has and continues to see enormous value in collaborating with the fastest-growing motorsport on the planet, with viewership, commercial integration, and brand storytelling continuing to accelerate. Over eight seasons, ABB has moved from brand visibility to brand activation—integrating deeply into the fan experience, the sport’s ecosystem, and our innovation narrative.Also Read: Antonio Felix Da Costa shares happy memories as Porsche wins Formula E Teams and Manufacturers’ World Championships “This next chapter elevates the partnership even further. With ABB’s new positioning, we are co-creating opportunities across content, digital storytelling, and market engagement, transforming a title partnership into a year-round, value-generating relationship. It’s a model of how modern sponsorships should evolve, rooted in purpose and cultural alignment but measured by impact,” she added.Formula E Season 12 will begin with testing in Valencia in October.","ABB and Formula E have announced that they will continue their partnership in the upcoming season.

I couldn’t have dreamed of this when joining @fiaformulae and have been super fortunate to be in great cars fighting for wins and championships. Thanks to @jaguarracing for the last 3 seasons. It’s been a privilege to drive for Jaguar and our race team – and I sincerely wish them all the best in the future, knowing they will be tough competitors.Adding a mention of his Jaguar teammate, Cassidy wrote, “A big shoutout to my mate @mitchevans_ as well. He’s an unbelievable talent who I’ve learnt a lot from over the years and will be World Champion one day. This weekend he took one for me when he was the faster car in qualifying. Thanks to everyone for their messages and words of support during the season – it hasn’t gone unnoticed and is very much appreciated. I will see you on the grid in São Paulo in December. ”Mitch Evans dropped a heart emoji in reaction to his post.

It wasn’t just Jaguar TCS Racing’s Nick Cassidy who held his top position in London. Mahindra Racing’s Nyck de Vries also secured back-to-back podiums by finishing second in both races at the London E-Prix. His strong performance at the ExCeL Arena helped Mahindra finish fourth in the Formula E Teams’ Championship and fifth in the Manufacturers’ Championship. He was joined on the podium on Sunday by Envision Racing’s Sébastien Buemi.Nyck de Vries’ double podium in London brought his season tally to three, having also finished second in Monaco. Reflecting on his second consecutive podium, de Vries said, “It was certainly a very challenging race. Obviously, Nick [Cassidy] didn’t want to get too low on energy compared to everyone behind, so he was making sure he stayed on the same energy level as us. That resulted in a bit of a concertina effect behind us. ”He added, “I’m very pleased to bring home another podium and secure P4 for our team, because they’ve done an incredible job. To think that last year we qualified last on merit, and now we’ve come such a long way to finish fourth in the championship — this is a great effort.I’m very proud of everyone at Mahindra.”Envision Racing’s Sebastien Buemi also earned his third podium of the season in London, finishing third behind Nick Cassidy and Nyck de Vries in Sunday’s Round 16. In a heartwarming moment, his three sons joined him on the podium. Buemi had previously won the Monaco E-Prix and taken a podium in Jakarta.Speaking about ending the season on a high while many others were caught in collisions, Buemi said, “In the end, it was important to not get caught up in those incidents. I think I was lucky enough to avoid them well. I saved quite a bit of energy at the beginning, and that basically allowed me to take Attack Mode properly. So, in the end, I’m very happy with that. It’s good for the Teams’ Championship, and it’s satisfying to finish strong and score good points after a tough qualifying. ”Also Read: Nick Cassidy bids Jaguar farewell, celebrates with girlfriend Nathalia Soliani at London E-Prix afterparty At the end, Nick de Vries stood in eighth and Sebastien Buemi in twelfth position in the Formula E Driver Standings.","Mahindra Racing’s Nyck de Vries secured back-to-back podiums by finishing second in both races at the London E-Prix.

This result secured Cassidy second place in the FIA Drivers' World Championship at a packed ExCeL Arena in London.Speaking about his London victory, Cassidy said, “Honestly, I love racing in this place! It’s not been that kind to me in the last few years, but this weekend it’s absolutely delivered. When this stadium is packed full of people, it’s a pleasure to race here and it’s great for Formula E.”He added, “Also, it’s my last race for the team.Again, I had the best car today, and this one is 100% for them. When the tyres are working well and the car’s perfect, everything becomes efficient. It wasn’t easy at the start to keep the lead, but I think between Mitch [Evans] and myself, we managed it well. I’m gutted for him—having a one-two would have been perfect.”Following the London E-Prix, Jaguar shared a special poster of Nick Cassidy to bid him farewell.

Wimbledon 2025 winner Iga Swiatek suffers shock exit at Canadian Open; Ben Shelton rallies into quarters in Toronto,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/top-stories/wimbledon-2025-winner-iga-swiatek-suffers-shock-exit-at-canadian-open-ben-shelton-rallies-into-quarters-in-toronto/articleshow/123086557.cms,"Iga Swiatek (Christinne Muschi/The Canadian Press via AP)

Wimbledon champion Iga Swiatek became the latest high-profile casualty at the WTA Canadian Open on Sunday, falling 7-6 (7/1), 6-3 to Denmark’s Clara Tauson in the fourth round. Swiatek, seeded second in Montreal, followed top seed Coco Gauff, third seed Jessica Pegula, and fourth seed Mirra Andreeva in exiting early from the tournament.Swiatek, playing her first event since winning her sixth Grand Slam title at Wimbledon, looked out of rhythm and faltered in key moments. Tauson dominated the first set tiebreak and sealed the win after Swiatek's backhand found the net.Tauson, who avenged her Wimbledon loss to Swiatek, called the win “unreal.”“Obviously it's really great and it shows all the hard work I've been doing has been the right thing,” she said. “I'm getting more confidence in this kind of level and feeling like I belong here a bit more. I think that really helped me today in the important points.”She now faces Madison Keys, who saved two match points in her gritty 4-6, 6-3, 7-5 win over Karolina Muchova.“I'm really happy to get that win,” Keys told the crowd. “After losing the first set and even being match point down, being able to figure it out -- it's always a great day.”Meanwhile, Naomi Osaka surged into her first WTA 1000 quarterfinal since 2024, thrashing Anastasija Sevastova 6-1, 6-0 in just 49 minutes. Working with former Swiatek coach Tomasz Wiktorowski, Osaka said, “He's very direct and to the point. For someone like me, who my thoughts scatter around often, it's very helpful.”On the men’s side at the ATP National Bank Open in Toronto, Ben Shelton dug deep to defeat 13th-seeded Flavio Cobolli 6-4, 4-6, 7-6 (1), rallying from 2-4 down in the deciding set.“Really difficult match. I was down and out, being a break down in the third, the way that he was playing,” Shelton admitted.“I gave myself a second chance and I did a good job with it, kind of running from there… Coming through in the end I think speaks a lot about my mental toughness and my ability to be scrappy in those moments, more so than my actual play.”The 22-year-old, who now has 100 career match wins, will face ninth-seeded Alex de Minaur, a 6-2, 4-6, 6-4 winner over Frances Tiafoe.Elsewhere, sixth seed Andrey Rublev led Alejandro Davidovich Fokina 6-7 (3), 7-6 (2), 3-0 before the Spaniard retired due to exhaustion. Rublev moves on to face the winner of Taylor Fritz vs Jiri Lehecka.With upsets mounting and new stars stepping up, the Canadian Open continues to deliver high drama on both sides of the draw.","Wimbledon champion Iga Swiatek crashes out of the WTA Canadian Open.

Toronto:

'You have to compete'

Anastasija Sevastova stunned two-time defending champion Jessica Pegula 3-6, 6-4, 6-1 on Friday to book a fourth-round clash with Naomi Osaka at the WTA Canadian Open.Sevastova, a former world No. 11 now ranked 386th, snapped fourth-ranked Pegula's 11-match WTA Canada win streak, the longest since Serena Williams reeled off 14 consecutive wins in 2011, 2013 and 2014.She will try to extend her Montreal run in a round of 16 meeting with Osaka, a four-time Grand Slam champion from Japan who ousted another Latvian, 22nd seed Jelena Ostapenko, 6-2, 6-4.""Somehow, I was down 2-0 in the second set and started to play better and better,"" Sevastova said. ""Third set I played really good.""Just trying to stay on the court as long as possible,"" added Sevastova, who has dealt with injury since returning from maternity leave in February 2024.In the night session, second-seeded Iga Swiatek -- playing her first tournament since winning Wimbledon -- raced into the fourth round with a 6-2, 6-2 victory over Germany's Eva Lys.Swiatek next faces Denmark's Clara Tauson, who beat Yuliia Starodubtseva 6-3, 6-0.Pegula, last year's US Open runner-up in her best Slam showing, was the first woman to win back to back Canadian Open titles since Martina Hingis in 1999-2000.But she has struggled in recent months, dropping her openers at Wimbledon and at Washington last week.The American broke to open the match and again at love to claim the first set.But she couldn't maintain an early break in the second, with Sevastova breaking for a 5-4 lead and denying Pegula on three break chances before holding in the final game to force a third set in which she seized a 4-1 lead on the way to victory.""It was a weird match for me,"" Pegula said. ""I felt like I had total control and then I just played a couple of terrible games for, like, three games.""That totally flipped the momentum of the match, and I went from being up a set and 2-0 to being down very quickly.""I don't really feel like I'm playing great tennis,"" Pegula admitted. ""At times I am, but I feel very up and down, kind of sloppy, which I don't like. I've got to figure it out.""Osaka, twice a winner at both the US and Australian Opens, is one match away from her first quarter-final run at either a Grand Slam or WTA 1000 event since she returned from maternity leave at the start of 2024.Now ranked 49th, Osaka broke on a double fault to capture the first set in 30 minutes and raced to a 3-1 lead in the second.They exchanged breaks before Osaka served for the match with a 5-3 lead, but Ostapenko saved a match point on a forehand crosscourt winner and broke when Osaka sent a forehand beyond the baseline.The Japanese star responded by breaking Ostapenko at love in the final game.""I went in there knowing she's a great player and if I give her a chance she's going to hit a winner on me, so I just tried to keep my pace and stay as solid as I could,"" Osaka said.Australian Open champion Madison Keys, seeded sixth, beat fellow American Caty McNally 2-6, 6-3, 6-3 and will next meet Karolina Muchova, a 6-7 (2/7), 6-2, 6-3 winner over Belinda Bencic.Fifth-seeded American Amanda Anisimova, regrouping this week after a crushing 6-0, 6-0 loss to Swiatek in the Wimbledon final, swept past Britain's Emma Raducanu 6-2, 6-1.She lined up a meeting with Ukrainian Elina Svitolina, who beat Russian Anna Kalinskaya 6-1, 6-1.Taylor Fritz ended Canadian hopes at the ATP Toronto Masters on Friday as he crushed Gabriel Diallo 6-4, 6-2 to advance to the fourth round.The American second seed needed just 77 minutes to dispatch the the 37th-ranked local and book a meeting with Jiri Lehecka, a 3-6, 6-3, 6-4 winner over France's Arthur Fils.Fritz is aiming to at least reach the quarter-finals north of the border, the only Masters where he has not gone that far.He broke once in the opening set against a nervous opponent and dominated from there.""It was important not to let him get into the match and get the crowd fired up,"" Fritz said. ""I knew the momentum could shift at any time.""I'm super happy with it, considering how I felt on the court two nights ago in my first match,"" Fritz added.""I felt way more comfortable, confident, just hitting the ball, being aggressive, just striking it. I did well to be up an early break in the sets. I did well to just hold.""Played really solid from the baseline as well. I backed it up well from the ground, and just did a good job of not letting him back in the sets.""Brandon Nakashima won his first set against American Ben Shelton before the fourth-seeded Shelton rallied to finish off a 6-7 (8/10), 6-2, 7-6 (7/5) win.Shelton had trailed by a break in the deciding set and Nakashima saved four match points before Shelton sealed the victory with his 19th ace.Shelton finished with 46 winners to improve to 5-0 against Nakashima and will fight for a quarter-final berth against Flavio Cobolli, who downed Fabian Marozsan 6-2, 4-6, 6-3.""I've got to find my fire from somewhere,"" Shelton said of the late-night crowd support in Canada. ""I live off of that.""Night matches are never easy, the temperature cools down and conditions are different. I showed a lot of perseverance. it's difficult being down against a big server. To come from behind takes a bit of luck.""The seeded pair of Andrey Rublev and Frances Tiafoe were tested over three sets before also making their way into the fourth round.Sixth seed Rublev, runner-up in Canada a year ago to Alexei Popyrin, advanced 5-7, 6-4, 6-3 as Lorenzo Sonego double-faulted on match point in their contest.Tiafoe, the number seven, confessed to a bad day but earned his win the hard way as he beat Australian Aleksandar Vukic 6-3, 4-6, 6-3.""The ball was flying a lot, it was really ugly, but I'm happy to get through it,"" Tiafoe said. ""It doesn't matter how you win. You just have to compete.""Tiafoe next lines up against another Aussie in Alex de Minaur, who advanced when compatriot Christopher O'Connell pulled out with an injury.Rublev now goes against Alejandro Davidovich Fokina, who beat him this season on clay in Barcelona. The Spaniard beat Jakob Mensik 6-2, 6-4.""I'm really happy, it's my first time in the round of 16 here in Toronto,"" Rublev said, adding that he had to adjust his serve in windy conditions to fashion his comeback.""I played more aggressive in the second set and made fewer mistakes. I was doing more with my serve. I had to slow it wide in the wind.""","Anastasija Sevastova stuns two-time defending champion Jessica Pegula 3-6, 6-4,. 6-1 on Friday to book a fourth-round clash with Naomi Osaka.

Toronto:

Wimbledon champion Iga Swiatek cruised, Naomi Osaka battled through and Canadian Eugenie Bouchard called time on her WTA career with a gutsy second-round loss in Montreal on Wednesday.Switzerland's Belinda Bencic sent Bouchard into retirement with a 6-2, 3-6, 6-4 victory -- but not before the Canadian thrilled her hometown fans by seizing an early break in the third set.Spectators were on their feet, trying to will Bouchard to another victory on the heels of her first-round triumph on Monday -- her first WTA win since 2023.But Bencic won five of the last six games to vanquish Bouchard, who had announced earlier in July she would retire after a final appearance in her home tournament.""I think it's so special to play my last match here in Montreal on this court in front of you guys,"" a teary Bouchard said as she was honoured on court after the match.""I remember being a little kid sitting in these stands, hoping and dreaming that I would play on this court one day.""I grew up playing on these courts, and courts all around Montreal and near here, so it feels like such a full circle moment to finish my career here.""Bouchard, who rose as high as fifth in the world rankings, shot to prominence in 2014 when she reached the Wimbledon final and made semi-final runs at the Australian and French Opens.But her career was hindered by injuries, including a concussion suffered in a locker room slip at the 2015 US Open and a shoulder injury that required surgery in 2021.There was no drama for Poland's Swiatek, who breezed past Chinese qualifier Guo Hanyu 6-3, 6-1 in her first match since her crushing victory over Amanda Anisimova in the Wimbledon final.Swiatek, seeded second, broke Guo's serve six times to book her spot in the third round.It was much harder going for Japan's four-time Grand Slam champion Osaka, who saved two match points in a 4-6, 7-6 (8/6) 6-3 triumph over Liudmila Samsonova.Osaka, now working with Tomasz Wiktorowski after announcing on Monday she had split with coach Patrick Mouratoglou, surrendered early breaks in each of the first two sets.Wimbledon quarter-finalist Samsonova served for the match at 5-4 in the second and led 40-15. The Russian fired a forehand long on her first match point and on her second a lackluster drop shot effort gave Osaka an opening and the Japanese star pounced.Samsonova's double fault on break point allowed Osaka to level the set, and after storming back from 5-2 down in the tiebreaker to force a third set Osaka took control early, breaking Samsonova twice on the way to a 4-1 lead.""She definitely came out really hard and, for me, I was definitely overwhelmed and I didn't know if I should also be hitting winners,"" Osaka said. ""After a while I just tried to keep the ball in court.""Jessica Pegula, the two-time defending champion and third seed, saved five set points in the opening set on the way to a 7-5, 6-4 victory over Maria Sakkari of Greece.Australian Open champion Madison Keys, the sixth seed, opened her campaign with a 6-2, 6-1 victory over Laura Siegemund, avenging a third-round loss to the German at Wimbledon.Second-seeded Taylor Fritz struggled with three rain delays and a stubborn Spanish opponent on Wednesday, pulling out a tight 7-5, 7-6 (7/1) win over Roberto Carballes Baena at the ATP Toronto Masters.The second-round match was halted repeatedly by light rain, with the final 18-minute pause coming just as the second-set tiebreaker was about to start.But Fritz, winner of Stuttgart and Eastbourne titles this season, quickly sprinted to victory before heavier rains were expected to set in.The American was far from pleased with a win which was marred by 45 unforced errors and confessed that he has not yet felt on his game in Canada.""Even in practice I'm having a hard time putting the ball into the court,"" he said. ""But I'm happy to get through this one.""Everything is not feeling great, it's tough to control the ball.""Since I've been here it's been absolutely brutal. But I have another match to figure it out and hopefully I can play myself into the tournament.""Fritz's fourth-seeded compatriot Ben Shelton had no complaints after earning his first career win over gritty Frenchman Adrian Mannarino 6-2, 6-3.Shelton had dropped two prior meetings with 37-year-old qualifier Mannarino but said he was able to vary his serve to get over the line this time.""This win was huge for me.

IND Pace Attack Will Be Over Reliant On Jasprit Bumrah During #BGT in AUS

NEW DELHI: Former Australian captain Michael Clarke has shared his thoughts on the Indian cricket team's recent performances against New Zealand. Clarke believes that the team's demanding schedule has contributed to their recent struggles.“Take nothing away from New Zealand, but it tells me India are so fatigued. Some of their shot selection, the use of bowlers, and even Rohit saying he wasn’t at his best—it’s mental fatigue. They’ve played so much cricket without a break,” Clarke said on the Around the Wicket podcast.Despite his observations about their fatigue, Clarke remains optimistic about India's prospects in the upcoming Border-Gavaskar series in Australia. He believes that key players like Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma , once well-rested, will lead the team to a strong performance.“They know they’ve played well out here in Australia and they’ll still come here with plenty of talent and that self-belief,” Clarke added.Meanwhile, former Australian captain Aaron Finch has expressed his disagreement with Indian cricket legend Sunil Gavaskar 's views on India's captaincy. The discussion revolves around the possibility of current Indian captain Rohit Sharma missing the first Test, or even the first two Tests, of the series due to personal reasons.Gavaskar had suggested that in Rohit's absence, the team's vice-captain, Jasprit Bumrah , should captain India for the entire series to maintain continuity. Gavaskar believes it would be more beneficial for Bumrah to lead throughout the series rather than having Rohit take over mid-series upon his return.Finch, speaking on the Around the Wicket podcast, disagreed with Gavaskar's perspective.“I disagree with Sunny on that totally. Rohit Sharma is the captain of the Indian cricket team. If you need to stay at home because your wife’s going to have a baby… that’s such a beautiful moment, and you take all the time that you need in that regard,"" Finch said.The much-anticipated Border-Gavaskar series, consisting of five Test matches between India and Australia, is scheduled to commence on November 22.",Former Australian captain Michael Clarke believes India's recent performances have been down to mental fatigue.

NEW DELHI: 1983 World Cup winner Sandeep Patil on Wednesday described India's recent series loss to New Zealand as a 'wake-up call', urging the team to leave the past behind as they gear up for the upcoming Australia tour.Patil emphasized that India must learn from their mistakes in order to compete effectively on Australian soil, where conditions and the quality of the opposition present unique challenges. Rohit Sharma 's Indian team will soon arrive in Australia with their pride on the line, following a 0-3 series loss to New Zealand at home that has disrupted their World Test Championship plans.As Team India aims to regroup and deliver a strong performance in the five-Test series, former selector and ex-cricketer Patil expressed confidence in the team’s ability to bounce back.Patil believes the squad is talented and resilient enough to overcome recent setbacks and refocus on achieving success in challenging Australian conditions.""They have to play against Australia in Australia, they will have to forget what happened there last time. They will also have to forget what happened in this series (against New Zealand) and look forward,"" said Patil during the launch of his book titled 'Beyond Boundaries '.""We lost all practice games before winning the World Cup, so they should remember... you have to think positive and play positively only then you will get a positive result,"" he said.""If you play defensive cricket and think of winning, it is not going to happen,"" he added.However, Patil noted that the historic series whitewash by New Zealand serves as a wake-up call for Indian cricket.""This (series loss) was like a wake-up call. It's not like our team has been playing badly. A few months back they won the T20 World Cup. There are some big players in our team, surely they will bounce back,"" he said.""They must have learnt so many things from this loss,"" he added.Patil expressed confidence in India's ability to recover strongly, emphasising their consistent pattern of resurgence after setbacks.""After every defeat, you have always seen the Indian team bouncing back. Not because I am an Indian and we all are Indians, but they will bounce back because they are a very good side,"" he stated.Regarding the Perth pitch, Patil noted its evolution from its previous characteristics, whilst highlighting the generally favourable batting conditions in Australian grounds.""Perth back then was a fast wicket, it is not the same anymore. Australian wickets are basically batting-friendly wickets,"" he observed.He addressed the recent series loss against New Zealand, attributing it to underwhelming batting performances rather than outright failure.""We lost the series (against New Zealand) because the batting didn't do well. I will not use the word 'failed' because it is negative. We just did not do well in the batting department.""""We have Virat Kohli , Rohit Sharma, Shubman Gill and so many (other) great players. I am sure they would have got together and talked about it.""",1983 World Cup winner Sandeep Patil says India's recent series loss to New Zealand is a 'wake-up call' Patil urges the team to leave the past behind as they gear up for the upcoming Australia tour.

West Indies secured a commanding eight-wicket win over England in the decisive third one-day International at Barbados on Wednesday, with remarkable centuries from Keacy Carty and Brandon King leading the charge to clinch the series 2-1.The English side, batting first, managed to recover from a precarious 24-4, with Phil Salt 's impressive 74 helping them reach 263-8. Jofra Archer contributed significantly with his 17-ball unbeaten blitz producing 38 runs towards the end of the innings.But Archer's bowling left a lot to be desired, as Carty (128 not out) scored his maiden international century whilst King (102) registered his third ODI ton. Their substantial second-wicket partnership of 209 runs ensured a comfortable victory for the West Indies.The teams will face each other again in a T20I series starting Saturday at Barbados' Kensington Oval, with Jos Buttler potentially returning from injury to lead the English side.For England, Liam Livingstone, who had scored his first ODI century to level the series in the second match on Saturday, was amongst four early dismissals within the first 10 overs. Salt's partnership with Sam Curran (40) and Dan Mousley's (57) first ODI fifty helped stabilise England's innings.The hosts faced a setback when Romario Shepherd sustained an injury mid-spell, forcing Sherfane Rutherford to bowl. England capitalised on this situation, particularly through Archer's aggressive batting, scoring 57 runs off Rutherford's 3.5 overs. Jamie Overton also played a cameo of 32 off 21 balls.Overton dismissed Evin Lewis for 19 to hit Windies' chase early, but the formidable stand between King and Carty dashed the visitors' aspirations. The remarkable partnership marked only the third instance in West Indies ODI history where a duo amassed over 200 runs in a home fixture.King's innings concluded when Reece Topley clean bowled him, but by then the damage had been done. Carty, who emerged as the series' leading run-getter, fittingly sealed the triumph with a boundary.The defeat marked England's third consecutive ODI series loss following their underwhelming World Cup campaign in India last year.",West Indies beat England by eight wickets in third ODI at Barbados.

#INDvsNZ: Rohit Sharma and Co. Need to Stop Playing On Raging Turners At Home

That beautiful June afternoon in Barbados now seems a million miles away. Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli - the two best Indian batters of this generation - had just realized their long-cherished dream of winning a World Cup together. Immediately after India's title-winning run, they proceeded to announce their T20 retirements in a span of half-an-hour, but you could see both were hopeful about a bright couple of years ahead in the other two formats.Just five months on, though, the cutthroat quality of international cricket has reminded the two champions that life can be cruel. Little did they know on June 29 that India would be departing for the five-Test series in Australia with little or no hope of making the World Test Championship final, and that there would be serious question marks over their futures.From a World Cup-winning captain, Rohit has now become the first Indian skipper to suffer a whitewash at home in Tests. Virat is in the middle of a most dismal year in red-ball cricket, with 250 runs from six games at an average of 22.72.Virat turned 36 on Tuesday and it's an age when a tour of Australia can be really challenging. We have seen some great careers coming to an end in Australia - from Dilip Vengsarkar and VVS Laxman to Rahul Dravid - and all those who have loved the Delhi cricketer for so long wouldn't want a similar story to pan out over the next couple of months.Former India captain Krishnamachari Srikkanth, who also finished his Test career in Australia in 1992, is hopeful that Virat will weather the storm. ""The best thing about Virat is the determination and the hunger to achieve more. Add to that his enviable record in Australia and I think he will bounce back strongly from this debacle against New Zealand,"" Srikkanth told TOI.Virat's first Test century came in Adelaide during the 2011-12 series and since then, the modern master has added five more to his kitty Down Under. ""The bounce from the pitches in Australia isn't something that should bother Virat. In fact, he is probably at his best against the short ball, and the fact that he is extremely fit gives him a good chance to succeed,"" Srikkanth said, adding that he believes Virat still has a couple of years of Test cricket left in him.The situation, probably, isn't as straight forward for Rohit. Just 91 runs from three Tests against New Zealand is as bad as it can be, and it's the nature of dismissals that's going to worry the skipper more than anything else.It's the pacers who dismissed Rohit four out of six times in the New Zealand series where spinners called all the shots barring the first innings in Bengaluru. The way he was hurried on to mistiming his favourite pull-shot in both the innings at Wankhede would surely leave the right-hander a worried man going to Australia.While Srikkanth said on his YouTube channel that Rohit may pull the curtains down on his Test career if he doesn't do well in Australia, he went into a deeper analysis of what the captain needs to do as a batter if he has to succeed in the Border Gavaskar Trophy .""I also had a similar batting style to Rohit, I mean a bit of a dasher. What experience taught me is that even if you are an attacking opener, it is important to give yourself a little more time in the middle, especially in Australia, before going for the shots,"" Srikkanth, who was the chairman of selectors when the 2011-12 debacle in Australia happened, said.What complicates things just a little more for Rohit is that he is the captain of the side. If the team doesn't do well, all the pressure will come on him and the Australians will look to feed on that. They will look to keep the captain down because that can pull the entire Indian team down, a thing that Rohit has to guard against. Sunil Gavaskar, in fact, has suggested that if Rohit doesn't lead the team in the first Test due to personal reasons, the captaincy for the entire series should be given to Jasprit Bumrah Srikkanth didn't want to get into that debate, but he wants Rohit to be cautious about the fact that ""your strength can sometimes turn into your weakness in Australia"".""The Aussies have seen that Rohit isn't at his best with the pull shot early on in his innings. They are going to bowl slightly short at a good pace on bouncy tracks to Rohit, asking him to go for his favourite stroke. All Rohit needs to do is to be slightly careful and he has the talent to manage it from there,"" Srikkanth said.That's what all of us want. It's on Rohit and Virat to justify the belief and keep the Indian flag flying Down Under.","Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli will probably feature on their last tour of Australia.

European heavyweights Real Madrid and Manchester City both suffered big defeats in the Champions League on Tuesday.Defending champions Madrid were humbled 3-1 at home by AC Milan , while Erling Haaland missed a penalty and City squandered a fourth-minute lead as they lost 4-1 at Sporting Lisbon , whose coach will soon take charge of its crosstown rival.It was a much better evening for Liverpool , as Luis Diaz scored a hat trick and Cody Gakpo grabbed another goal in a 4-0 win over German champion Bayer Leverkusen at Anfield that marred Xabi Alonso’s return to his old home.The Leverkusen coach was given a warm welcome on his return to the club where he became a fan favorite as a player over five seasons between 2004-09. Alonso won the Champions League with Liverpool in 2005.Liverpool moved to the top of the league phase table with four wins from four games, followed by Sporting and Monaco, both on 10 points after three wins and a draw. Under the new 36-team format introduced by UEFA this season, the top eight teams advance directly to the next round, and those from ninth to 24th enter playoffs to reach it, while the bottom 12 are eliminated.Before their game, Sporting fans displayed a huge tifo thanking Ruben Amorim in his last home game before he takes over Manchester United.Phil Foden then got City off to a flying start in the fourth minute, only the second goal Sporting have conceded in four games of the competition.But Swedish forward Viktor Gyokeres scored a hat trick as Sporting came roaring back. Gyokeres first equalized in the 38th after a perfect through ball from Geovany Quenda, before Maximiliano Araújo made it 2-1 right after the break. Gyokeres then made it 3-1 from the penalty spot after Josko Gvardiol was penalized for a shove on Francisco Trincão in the area.Haaland’s penalty hit the crossbar, before Gyökeres showed the Norwegian how it’s done with another spot kick at the other end to complete the scoring.It is the first time since 2018 that City have lost three straight games, coming off a defeat to Tottenham in the English League Cup and a loss to Bournemouth in the Premier League.“In my seven and a half years at the club, I don't remember losing three games in a row,” City midfielder Bernardo Silva said.In Spain, Christian Pulisic sent in a corner for Malick Thiaw to head Milan into a 12th-minute lead, ensuring Madrid trailed in a third straight game in the Champions League this season. The 15-time champions had already lost to surprise team Lille in their second game.Vinícius Júnior equalized from the penalty spot in the 23rd after he’d been tripped, but Álvaro Morata pounced on the rebound after Andriy Lunin saved Rafael Leão’s shot to restore the visitors’ lead against his former club.Morata had already been given a hostile reception from the home fans, who evidently remember the goal he scored to take Juventus through to the 2015 final at their team’s expense.Tijjani Reijnders scored Milan’s third goal as the home fans made their frustrations known at Santiago Bernabéu Stadium.“The last two defeats are inexplicable. We have to analyze and react quickly,"" Lunin said, referring to Madrid's 4-0 loss to Barcelona in their previous Spanish league game.It's the first time since 2009 that Madrid have lost two successive games at home with at least three goals conceded in each, according to Opta.“We have to get back on track,” Lunin said.German forward Nicolas Kuhn scored twice as Celtic defeated Leipzig 3-1 at home, and Juventus drew 1-1 at Lille.Lille midfielder Edon Zhegrova eluded two defenders before playing a perfect pass for Jonathan David, who fired inside the far post, but Dusan Vlahovic equalized with a penalty for the Italian club.Donyell Malen scored late for Borussia Dortmund to beat Sturm Graz 1-0 at home, and Thilo Kehrer did likewise for Monaco to win at Bologna 1-0.United States midfielder Malik Tillman scored one goal and set up another as PSV Eindhoven beat Spanish team Girona 4-0.Dinamo Zagreb dealt Slovan Bratislava their fourth straight defeat in the competition as the visitors came from behind to win 4-1 in Bratislava.",Real Madrid lose 3-1 at home to AC Milan.

IND Pace Attack Will Be Over Reliant On Jasprit Bumrah During #BGT in AUS

Afghanistan secured a comfortable victory in the first One-Day International against Bangladesh, winning by 92 runs on Wednesday. The star of the show was Afghanistan's 18-year-old spinner, Allah Ghazanfar, who recorded career-best figures of 6-26.Ghazanfar's impressive performance effectively dismantled Bangladesh's middle and lower order. At one stage, Bangladesh seemed well-placed to chase down Afghanistan's total of 235, reaching 132/3. However, Ghazanfar's devastating spell saw them collapse to 143 all out.Ghazanfar's figures of 6-26 are now the best by any bowler in ODIs between Bangladesh and Afghanistan, surpassing Shakib Al Hasan 's 5-29 in 2019.The two teams will play the second and third ODIs, scheduled for November 9 and 11 in Sharjah.Earlier in the match, Afghanistan found themselves struggling at 35/4 after opted to bat first. Captain Hashmatullah Shahidi (52) and the experienced Mohammad Nabi (84) steadied the innings with a crucial 104-run partnership for the sixth wicket. Despite their efforts, Afghanistan were eventually bowled out for 235 in 49.4 overs. Bangladesh's pace duo of Taskin Ahmed and Mustafizur Rahman were the pick of the bowlers, both finishing with four wickets each.Bangladesh's reply began confidently, with opener Soumya Sarkar scoring 33. Najmul Hossain Shanto top-scored with 47, while Mehidy Hasan contributed 28. However, the dismissal of Najmul by Nabi, with the score at 132, triggered a dramatic collapse.Ghazanfar then took center stage, claiming the breakthrough in his fifth over by dismissing Mehidy. He followed that up by quickly dismissing Mushfiqur Rahim, Rishad Hossain, and Taskin Ahmed, effectively ending Bangladesh's hopes.Afghanistan skipper Shahidi was full of praise for the young spinner, saying, ""He is a passionate youngster who always wants to do well.""Najmul, on the other hand, felt his dismissal was the turning point in the match.""I think my wicket turned the match,"" said Najmul. ""I was the set batsman so when I got out we needed to bat longer but credit to Afghanistan spinners for the way they bowled.""",Afghanistan beat Bangladesh by 92 runs in first One-Day International. 18-year- old spinner Allah Ghazanfar takes career-best figures of 6-26.

Bihar fielders were sent on a leather hunt by the Madhya Pradesh batters as they reached 381/4 in 88 overs on the opening day of their fourth-round Group C Ranji Trophy encounter in Patna on Wednesday.Opting to bat first, MP captain Shubham Sharma (134 batting off 182 balls) and Venkatesh Iyer (118 batting off 113 balls) both scored unbeaten centuries to lead the onslaught against the Bihar bowlers who looked quite helpless despite playing at home.Shubham, who had scored an unbeaten 143 against Karnataka, was back to his best after missing out in the last match against Haryana and played a patient knock that included 11 fours and one six. He came to the middle after the dismissal of Himanshu Mantri and initially shared a 16-run partnership with Rajat Patidar. Once Patidar was dismissed, he joined hands with Harpreet Singh Bhatia.However, Bhatia didn’t last long either and Iyer joined his skipper in the middle in the 45th over and for the next 43 overs the duo went after the Bihar bowlers.Kolkata Knight Riders all-rounder Iyer especially was in a belligerent mood from the very word go as he hit 11 fours and four over boundaries.He took a special liking towards Sachin Kumar Singh off whom he scored 46 runs. By the end of the day the duo amassed 234 runs off 260 balls and will look to add some quick runs on the second day to make sure the Bihar batters has a mountain to climb.As for the Bihar bowlers, they have a huge task at hand after being taken to the cleaners on the opening day. Himanshu Singh, who had been Bihar’s most successful bowler so far in the tournament, was able to get just one wicket of Harpreet in his 25 overs by giving away 111 runs.Sachin, meanwhile, was the most successful bowler for Bihar on the day as he returned figures of 2/137 in 30 overs. Shabbir Khan was the other wicket taker for the hosts as he removed the dangerous Patidar in the 33rd over.Despite such a lopsided scorecard, the hosts had begun quite well earlier in the day and reduced Madhya Pradesh to 37/1 by sending Yash Dubey back to the pavilion in 16th over.Even though the runs kept coming, Bihar kept taking wickets at regular intervals to reduce MP to 147 for 4.After that though it was a Shubham-Iyer show which the Bihar players could only watch on.",Madhya Pradesh reached 381/4 in 88 overs on the opening day of their Group C Ranji Trophy encounter in Patna. Shubham Sharma (134) and Venkatesh Iyer (118) both scored unbeaten centuries. Sachin Kumar Singh was the most successful bowler for Bihar with figures of 2/137.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115026979,imgsize-20484,width-400,resizemode-4/115026979.jpg"
Sandeep Patil says India must play attacking cricket in Australia and embrace transition,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/sandeep-patil-says-india-must-play-attacking-cricket-in-australia-and-embrace-transition/articleshow/115026680.cms,"(Pic Credit - X)

MUMBAI: Sandeep Patil , former India player and one-time chairman of the selection committee, said on Wednesday that the 3-0 series defeat against New Zealand needs to be a “wake-up call” for the Indian team. However, he backed them to come good in the five-Test Border Gavaskar Trophy against Australia starting Nov 22.“Unfortunately, we’ve lost the series against New Zealand. But I’m sure they must have learnt so many things from this loss. I hope they repeat their performance of 2020-2021. This series loss was like a wake-up call. It’s not like our team has been playing badly. Few months back they won the T20 World Cup. There are some big players in our team and surely, they will bounce back,” said Patil, who was part of the Indian team that won the 1983 World Cup.A dashing batter in his prime, Patil added that the current team can take a cue from the 1983 World Cup triumph, a campaign which didn’t start on a great note. “We lost all practice games before winning the World Cup, so they should remember that. You must think positive and play positively, only then you will get a positive result. If you play defensive cricket and think of winning, it is not going to happen,” Patil said on the sidelines of the launch of his book ‘Beyond Boundaries’ at the CCI on Wednesday.After the defeat against the Black Caps, the entire focus has shifted to how India will fare against Australia and which Indian team will turn-up when the first Test kicks off in Perth on Nov 22. Patil said that they must forget about what happened in the last series against Australia, or the recent one against New Zealand, and instead focus on the job ahead.He also said the Australian pitches would suit India: “Australian wickets are basically batting-friendly wickets. We lost the series to New Zealand because the batting didn’t do well. I will not use the word failed because it is negative. We did not do well in the batting department. We have Virat Kohli Rohit Sharma , Shubman Gill and so many other good players. I’m sure they would have got together and talked about it.”There are murmurs about phasing out seniors like Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli and R Ashwin. Patil, who headed the selection committee that phased out many seniors including Sachin Tendulkar, said that’s part and parcel of the game.“The decisions we took were not because we hated someone or liked someone. We were looking at the future of Indian cricket. And after our term was over, the Indian team did extremely well. The new generation which replaced the earlier players did very well. The transition talk happens with every selector. There was talk of transition even when I played. Sunil Gavaskar retired, what will happen? Sachin Tendulkar retired, what will happen? Now there is talk about Rohit Sharma. Transition will go on, it’s part of cricket. You must look at the future.”",Former India player Sandeep Patil says the 3-0 series defeat against New Zealand needs to be a “wake-up call” for the Indian team.

Who Can RCB Get?! 🏏 360 Show S06E08

NEW DELHI: With the Indian Premier League (IPL) 2025 mega auction approaching, former South African cricketer AB de Villiers has shared some bold and intriguing insights about Royal Challengers Bengaluru's (RCB) strategy.The franchise has retained Virat Kohli, Rajat Patidar, and uncapped pacer Yash Dayal, keeping Rs 83 crore available for auction, which gives RCB substantial flexibility.De Villiers believes that RCB’s retention choices set a solid base and sees potential for the team to acquire impactful players who could make RCB a title contender.“The good news is we still have Virat. And we didn’t spend too much with the retentions. There’s a lot in the bank still, which I’m very happy about,” de Villiers remarked on his YouTube channel.Kohli’s consistency and leadership are the backbone of RCB, with his impressive 2024 season where he scored 741 runs at a strike rate of 154.70 earning him the Orange Cap.But, according to de Villiers, Kohli alone isn’t enough; the squad needs more players with skills tailored for Chinnaswamy Stadium.De Villiers sees leg-spinner Yuzvendra Chahal as a priority: “Let’s just get Yuzi back at RCB where he belongs. He should never have left.”He also suggested a robust bowling unit, ideally including Chahal, Kagiso Rabada , and Ravichandran Ashwin.“We’re talking about a tournament-winning attack there,” he added.Additionally, de Villiers suggested Bhuvneshwar Kumar as an option if Rabada isn’t available, highlighting his vision for a versatile, street-smart team that can excel on the home ground.""My four priority players are Yuzvendra Chahal, Kagiso Rabada, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, and Ravi Ashwin. We can make a plan with the rest of the money we have left in the auction. If you can't get Rabada, I get hold of Mohammed Shami. If you can't get him, get hold of Arshdeep Singh . So there's lots of options,"" he further added.“We don't need a trophy. Forget about the trophy. We need a team that understands the Chinnaswamy, who are street smart, who can bowl to plans, who can play to plans, who has got a very good understanding about the game of cricket ,” de Villiers noted.With a calculated mix of spin, pace, and experience, RCB’s potential auction strategy could be groundbreaking. As de Villiers suggests, RCB has a strong chance to build a winning formula with the right investments.","Royal Challengers Bengaluru have retained Virat Kohli, Rajat Patidar, and uncapped pacer Yash Dayal, keeping Rs 83 crore available for auction.

Despite fine batting performances by Tamil Nadu batters C Andre Siddharth and Vijay Shankar , hosts Assam restricted their much-fancied opponents to 299 for seven with some disciplined bowling in Guwahati on Wednesday.Fortune swayed in favour of both sides throughout the opening day of the fourth-round match of Ranji Trophy Elite Group D, which saw Assam starting on a fine note returning both Tamil Nadu openers Suresh Lokeshwar and Narayan Jagadeesan for only 13 runs on board in the third over after opting to field first.Medium pacer Darshan Rajbongshi gave Assam the first breakthrough dismissing Lokeshwar while his new-ball partner Mukhtar Hussain accounted for wicketkeeper-batter Jagadeesan. Rajbongshi then returned former India A player Pradosh Ranjan Paul, who threw away a fine start of 27 off 40 balls as the scoreboard read 79 for three.Shankar and Siddharth then joined hands to put up 98 runs for the fourth wicket to solidify the Tamil Nadu innings before the former was castled by veteran off-spinner Swarupam Purkayastha, who was the pick of Assam bowlers returning 2/33 from his 12 overs.His tweak partner, left-arm spinner Rahul Singh, also scalped two wickets while medium pacer Rajbongshi bowled a fine spell in the first session of the day to return with 2/75.T20 specialist Shahrukh Khan (28) got a good start but failed to convert that into a big one while captain Sai Kishore (3) returned soon, too, as Tamil Nadu could not get any big partnership going after Shankar’s dismissal. Kishore lasted only 15 balls on his return from India A duty at ACC Men’s T20 Emerging Teams Asia Cup and was the last man dismissed on Day 1.Mohamed Ali (27 batting off 78 balls) and Sonu Yadav (12 batting off 30) then saw off the last 10 overs of the day as stumps were drawn after 85 overs of Tamil Nadu’s first innings.Earlier, Siddarth missed out on a well-deserved century by six runs (94 off 163 balls, 9 fours, 1 six) while Shankar followed up his hundred with a 76 at Barsapara Cricket Stadium to help Tamil Nadu reach a formidable total at the end of the day.",Assam restrict Tamil Nadu to 299 for seven in their first innings.

Brief score:

JAIPUR: There were no big individual scores, but Hyderabad relied on small partnerships to see the day through in Rajasthan 's backyard SMS Stadium in an Elite Group B Ranji Trophy match on Wednesday.Having chosen to bat first, the visitors must be satisfied with 261/5 in 88 overs at the time of stumps. Since 2023, the average score in the first innings at the First Class level here is 287 and the visitors are well within the reach of that figure.The growing partnership of unbeaten 55 runs between youngsters Rahul Radesh (43 not out off 117 balls) and Ajay Dev Goud (34 not out off 60 balls) puts Hyderabad in control.On a track that assisted spin, Rajasthan fielded only one full-time spinner, Ajay Kookna. The left-arm bowler, who was introduced into the attack in the 11th over, created substantial difficulty for the batsmen with the drift and bounce that he generated.The 27-year-old spinner was the pick of the bowlers, accounting for dismissals of the three top-order Hyderabad batters. Abhirath Reddy failed to pick the length of the ball and was clean bowled at 21 off 37 balls while Tanmay Agarwal (40 off 71 balls), centurion of the last game against Pondicherry, became the victim of a premeditated paddle sweep as a thick top-edge went to Mahipal Lomror at the first slip. Later, Kookna came around the wicket to trap left-hand batsman Rohit Rayudu (21 off 75 balls) leg-before-wicket.Kookna bowled 29 overs, maximum among all the eight bowlers who rolled their arms.Reeling at 137/4, a significant contribution of 66 off 100 balls came from Hyderabad skipper Rahul Singh Gahlaut. He first collaborated with Himateja Kodimela for a 42-run partnership and then with Goud to coalesce 69 runs.Radesh, whose highest score in the previous three matches this season is 94 against Uttarakhand, has a chance to convert the good start into a big score and put his team in a commanding position.The 21-year-old left-hand batter took his time to settle down as Hyderabad scored 70 runs and lost only a wicket in the last session of the play.Hyderabad 261/5 in 88 overs (Tanmay Agarwal 40, Rahul Singh Gahlaut 66, Rahul Radesh 43 not out; Ajay Kookna 3-88) vs Rajasthan","Rajasthan fielded only one full-time spinner, Ajay Kookna.

IND Pace Attack Will Be Over Reliant On Jasprit Bumrah During #BGT in AUS

Watch Beyond the Boundary from Monday-Friday at 6:30pm IST as Times of India dives deep into the cricket action on and off the field.

The panel highlighted that bounce generally doesn't trouble Indian batters like Virat Kohli Rohit Sharma , and Shubman Gill.The episode began by addressing India's possible over-reliance on Jasprit Bumrah . The panel considered the impact of Mohammed Shami 's absence and Siraj's recent dip in form, attributing it to a change in his run-up. There was a shared sentiment that India might face difficulties if Bumrah doesn't perform well.The discussion then shifted to the strengths of the Indian pacers. The panel highlighted the performances of Prasidh Krishna and Harshit Rana , acknowledging their potential contributions. Hardik Pandya 's omission from the squad was also a topic of conversation.The panel also speculated on India's likely bowling lineup for the first Test at Perth.

VILLA SLIDE

BAYERN AND DINAMO

NEXT UP

Barcelona and Inter Milan won again in the Champions League on Wednesday though both former title-holders are looking up in the standings toward upstart newcomer Brest.Aston Villa started the week atop the 36-team table but their winning run ended after a bizarre penalty was awarded when defender Tyrone Mings picked up the ball in the area at Club Brugge, resulting in a 1-0 loss that sent the English club plummeting to eighth place.Paris Saint-Germain , in their first season without Kylian Mbappe, trail far behind in 25th after Atletico Madrid scored in stoppage time to seal a 2-1 win for the Spanish team at Parc des Princes.Barcelona’s blistering scoring form continued in a 5-2 win at Red Star Belgrade — a seventh straight win since the start of October at a rate of four goals per game. Robert Lewandowski scored twice and has 21 this season.Inter Milan stifled Arsenal in a 1-0 win at San Siro sealed by Hakan Çalhanoğlu’s penalty in first-half stoppage time.Inter are unbeaten on 10 points and in fifth place, one below Brest who won 2-1 at Sparta Prague. The French debutants look sure to advance to the knockout phase starting in February.Atalanta won 2-0 at Stuttgart to stay unbeaten on eight points and Salzburg got their first goals and points in a 3-1 win at Feyenoord.Bayern Munich won 1-0 at home to Benfica in a game that was delayed 15 minutes by crowd congestion and then was played in a muted atmosphere because of a medical incident for a fan.Shakhtar Donetsk playmaker Heorhiy Sudakov had a fine assist and an even better goal in a 2-1 win for the Ukrainian champion against Young Boys. Shakhtar’s No. 10 showed why he is expected to be the club’s next big-money sale.Liverpool, who on Tuesday routed Bayer Leverkusen 4-0, lead the standings at the midway point of the eight-round program.Liverpool is the only team with four straight wins, while five teams have four losses. They are Leipzig, Sturm Graz, Young Boys, Red Star and Slovan Bratislava.Two Italian teams – Inter Milan and Atalanta – have yet to concede a goal in four games. Another Italian side, Bologna, is the only team with no goals scored.Villa had led the standings in the new league-phase format after three straight wins without conceding a goal — and it took a bizarre incident before goalkeeper Emiliano Martínez was eventually beaten.Mings was punished for picking up the ball when Martínez seemed to restart play with a goal kick passed forward to his teammate. Mings walked a couple steps to gather the ball with his left hand and returned to place it in the six-yard box.""It’s the biggest mistake I witnessed in my career,” Villa coach Unai Emery said. “It has only happened one time in all my life. Today.”Brugge captain Hans Vanaken placed the 52nd-minute spot-kick to Martínez's left as the World Cup-winning Argentina goalkeeper dived to his right.It was the standout result of the inaugural week of the new Champions League in September: Bayern Munich 9, Dinamo Zagreb 2.It was the first time a team had scored nine times in a game in the 32-year Champions League era, and Dinamo fired its coach two days later.Since then? Bayern lost twice, including a 4-1 rout at Barcelona, and Dinamo won twice. At the end of play Wednesday, Bayern was 17th on six points, one place below Dinamo on seven. If those placings hold until January, they meet again twice more in the knockout playoffs round.The fifth round in three weeks' time has perhaps the stellar attraction of 144 games in the league phase: Liverpool vs Real Madrid.That game on November 27 is a rematch of the 2022 and 2018 finals, both won by Madrid, and the 1981 European Cup title match that Liverpool won.There is another final rematch: Bayern Munich hosts PSG on November 26 in a repeat of the pandemic-season final played in August 2020 without fans in Lisbon.Also, sixth-place Barcelona host Brest, a fixture which might have been overlooked when the draw was made in August yet the French team is currently fourth.Only the top eight teams in January advance directly to the round of 16 in March.","Liverpool is the only team with four straight wins, while five teams have four losses.

Former Manchester City defender Benjamin Mendy won a case against the club on Wednesday for most of over 11 million pounds ($14 million) in wages withheld after he was charged with sexual offences , of which he was later cleared.The France international filed a claim against Manchester City last year. The Premier League club stopped paying him in September 2021, shortly after he was charged with sexual offences, until the end of his contract in June 2023.Mendy was acquitted of six counts of rape and one count of sexual assault in January 2023, following a trial at Chester Crown Court . He was found not guilty of one count of rape and one of attempted rape after a retrial.The 30-year-old argued City unlawfully deducted wages that he was due under his contract, saying in a witness statement that he had been promised he would be paid after he was cleared.City's lawyers, however, said Mendy was not paid because he was not able to perform his duties as he was held in custody before his trial for breaching his bail conditions.""Mr Mendy is entitled to recover some, but not all, of the sums claimed,"" Judge Joanne Dunlop said in a written ruling on Wednesday.Manchester City did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Mendy said in a statement posted on X: ""Having had to wait for three years for my wages, I am delighted with the decision and sincerely hope that the club will now do the honourable thing and pay the outstanding amounts, as well as the other amounts promised to me under the contract, without further delay, so I can finally put this difficult part of my life behind me.""Dunlop said in her ruling that Manchester City was entitled to withhold Mendy's pay for two periods he spent in custody, covering about five months of the 22-month period of his claim.When Mendy was not in custody, Dunlop found, he was ""ready and willing to work"" and prevented from doing so by his suspension by the Football Association and bail conditions ""which were unavoidable or involuntary on his part"".Mendy joined City from AS Monaco in 2017 for a fee of around 52 million pounds, on an annual salary of 6 million pounds.He signed for French club Lorient, currently in Ligue 2, shortly after his retrial.","Benjamin Mendy wins a case against Manchester City for over 11 million pounds.

have got 22 yellow cards in just 6 games so far in this ISL. Is discipline a worry for you so early in the season?

Jose Molina loves to live in the present. This is the byword for his life.The Mohun Bagan Super Giant coach's 'weltanschauung' or world philosophy may have been influenced by a personal battle to overcome cancer 22 years ago.Even a long-term contract is not something the 54-year-old Spaniard pines for. ""For me it's a piece of paper I need to sign. I'm here because Mohun Bagan wanted me and I wanted to come. But if any one of the parties is not happy, the best thing is to shake hands and leave,"" he said rather nonchalantly.His mind is now preoccupied with the catastrophic floods back in Spain. ""I live in the north of Valencia and floods have devastated the south. All my family and friends are okay. But it's a terrible catastrophe to have happened in Spain,"" he remarked, now with a serious, somber note.Molina - a former Spanish goalkeeper who's still regarded as a hero at Atletico Madrid - is not new to Indian football. By his own admission, since guiding now defunct ATK to the 2016 ISL title, he continued to be sounded out by several Indian clubs until he said yes to Bagan's call this year.During an exclusive chat with a select media persons, including TOI, at the Mohun Bagan tent on Tuesday, Molina opened up on several key chapters of his career, from playing with the likes of Diego Simeone and Lionel Scaloni to serving the Spanish football federation as its sporting director.I was a goalkeeper but made my debut for Spain as a left-winger! During the match against Norway (a friendly held in Oslo in 1996), the coach (Javier Clemente) used up all his substitutions and when another player got injured, I was given two options - either staying on the bench or coming on as a left-winger. I played for 16 minutes. (It was) not my position but an amazing experience.My last game (he played 9 matches in all for La Roja) was also against Norway (in Euro 2000). As a goalkeeper I made a mistake and we lost 1-0. The coach (José Antonio Camacho) said after the game that I would no longer play. As a player I had to accept the coach's decision. We all make mistakes and that decision still hurts me. Because I believe that I had the talent to play for Spain longer.I was also in the 1998 World Cup squad and (Andoni) Zubizarreta was No. 1 goalkeeper. We lost the first match 3-2 to Nigeria and Zubizarreta made mistakes. But the then coach (Clemente) decided that Zubizarreta stayed in the XI. That was not the case with me in 2000.Was it the best experience for me as a player? No. Every time I win any title that is the best experience. To win the ISL in 2016, the title in the Hong Kong league (with Kitchee). These are all parts of my best experiences.That was an amazing moment. Everyone at Real Madrid was preparing to celebrate the occasion by winning that match (Copa del Rey) since it was their centenary year and they were hosting the final at Estadio Santiago Bernabéu. It was more special because of my Atletico past. Day before the final, some of my friends at Atletico came over to me and wished me luck. People still talk about that match in La Coruna.When you are a player, you never know what will happen to you in future. Simeone and Scaloni - they too didn't know their future at that time. Even I wasn't sure about my future. I live in the present. Maybe my illness has helped me understand the value of enjoying my present as much as I can.One of the first things I did as a technical director (of Spanish football) was to look for more balance in our style and the kind of players suitable for this so that we could create a winning team. Football is a constant evolution. Spain has not changed tiki-taka style. But it's a process of evolution. Tiki-taka is still there, but sometimes you need to be more direct in your approach to the game.I am not happy with the AFC's decision. I would prefer my team to play in Asia. Now, you have to forget about the AFC and focus on ISL. We'll try to win it and play in the AFC next year to prove that an Indian team can be strong in Asia tournaments as well.Not at all. The yellow cards are the referee's decisions and they can be right or wrong. But Mohun Bagan have brought me here not to win the Fair play trophy but the title. If both are achieved, it's better, but the aim is always to win the championship.","Mohun Bagan coach Jose Molina is a former Spanish goalkeeper.

JFC suffer consecutive 5-goal hammering,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/indian-super-league/top-stories/jfc-suffer-consecutive-5-goal-hammering/articleshow/114964574.cms,"It proved to be another nightmare for Jamshedpur FC at JRD Tata Sports Complex on Monday as they were made to endure a 1-5 loss to Chennaiyin FC after their five-goal defeat in the last Indian Super League game.Jamshedpur's former Shield-winning coach Owen Coyle dealt a blow on Khalid Jamil's hosts with his new wards - with youngster Irfan Yadwad playing a lead role - as the visitors climbed two spots to sixth on the ISL table even as Jamshedpur held on to their fourth position after seven games with a number of seventh round fixtures still to go.The onslaught started as early as in the sixth minute when Pratik Chaudhary, in his bid to clear a Vinci Barretto cross from the left of the box, actually made a perfect finish into his own goal to the disappointment of his helpless goalkeeper Albino Gomes.Although Vishal Yumnam was a bit wide in putting in the ball in the 20th minute, Chennaiyin were gifted their second juts two minutes later. This time, it was the pace, skill and power of Yadwad as he vindicated the trust shown in him by veteran Coyle with a defence-splitting turn in the midfield that began the build-up to his first goal. The 23-year-old then made a run into the Jamshedpur box that could not be contained by the defenders led by Jamil's go-to man and captain Ashutosh Mehta as his shot at goal took a slight deflection en route the goal.There was no respite for Jamshedpur's weary defence, and Jamil at the stands, as two minutes later, in the 24th minute, Yadwad turned provider to Connor Shields - who had been missing his first goal of the season - with a pass outside the box that the Scottish shot into the right of the goal with Mehta at the other end.There was, however, no improvement in Jamshedpur's game as every trick in Khalid's book looked to have backfired in absence of defensive talisman Stepehn Eze, missing the match with a red card in the last game at NorthEast United.The script stayed the same after the change of ends as Chaudhary lost the ball a little outside the box to a Yadwad charge at him from the left in the 54th minute. It was Wilmar Jordan Gill who landed the pass from Yadwad and with only the goalkeeper to beat, made no mistake in adding the fifth to his goal tally this season.With both Jordan Murray and Javier Siverio having a bad day in office, and Jamil's 4-4-2 formation failing to stop the visitors' march, it was only a matter of time before Chennaiyin scored again and delivered a back-to-back five-goal assault on the Men of Steel. It was Lucas Brambilla's swerving solo effort from outside the box that left Gomes in another no position for a save.The hosts, with fans already leaving the Furnace, got a consolation goal after earning a controversial penalty kick from a Yadwad hand ball in the box - that was preceded by an offside call against Jamshedpur. Veteran Murray made no mistake to send in the spot kick but it was too little to ease the team and coach Jamil's disappointment after a great start to the season.",Jamshedpur lost 1-5 to Chennaiyin FC at JRD Tata Sports Complex on Monday.

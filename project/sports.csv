JOJI'S JOURNEY: KERALA TO CANADA

NEW DELHI: In 2017, Joji Varghese packed his luggage, left Thiruvananthapuram forever, and flew to Canada. He had obtained a Canadian PR — a challenging but necessary step to secure a bright future for his children. His wife had been working as a nurse in Italy, but language barriers made settling there difficult. A long-term vision, his children’s future, and a decent life — these were all in Joji's mind, and hence he chose Canada. While applying for PR, he needed a profession to qualify and chose a six-month massage therapy course. The course eventually helped him secure permanent residency in Canada.He moved to Canada and started living in Brampton, near Toronto.He had achieved all his dreams by then except one — meeting his favourite cricketer, Sanju Samson , whom he had watched play from afar at the same college where he worked as a physical education teacher.Fate, it seems, had its own plans. Destiny served that dream on a platter to Joji, and he became emotional.Over time, Joji made a name for himself as a skilled massage therapist in Canada and later got an opportunity to work with Cricket Canada.Now, he is travelling with the Canadian team for the T20 World Cup 2026 in India. Wearing the Canada jersey, he moves from one corner of a cricket ground to another, meeting cricketers from all over the world and cherishing every moment of his homecoming.Interestingly, his long-cherished dream was fulfilled when India and Canada were scheduled to practice at the Arun Jaitley Stadium recently in different time slots, and Joji got to meet his hero — Sanju Samson.""I was destined to meet him. It’s nothing short of a dream story for me. Finally meeting Sanju was truly a dream come true,"" Joji told TimesofIndia.com in an exclusive interview. ""Back when he was a college student, I would often see him on campus because we were in the same college. He was at Mar Baselios Engineering College in Thiruvananthapuram for his bachelor’s degree, and I was in the Sports Department in the same campus. """"When I learned that Canada and India were sharing the same practice session, I was really excited. And when I finally saw him on the ground, it became one of the most memorable moments of my life that I will cherish forever. Our conversation took place after his warm-up session when he came to the dressing room. Sanju was extremely humble, approachable, and down-to-earth. When I told him I was from Kerala, he immediately smiled, addressed me as ‘Chetta,’ and asked, ‘Sugamano?’—instantly creating a personal and emotional connection. Despite being such a big international star, he interacted with great simplicity and respect,"" he said.""We spoke about Canadian cricket and our journeys. Sanju also has a massive fan following in Canada. The Indian community there, as well as many members of the Canadian team, admire him deeply for his batting consistency and calm leadership. Among young cricketers and fans of Kerala origin, his popularity continues to grow. Every weekend, people form teams and play cricket, and Sanju is a big inspiration for them,"" Joji added.Joji has also worked with several international cricketers including Rassie van der Dussen, Dwaine Pretorius, Moeen Ali, Shane Bond, Tim Southee, Yuvraj Singh and Mark Chapman.With his wife working in Italy, Joji managed both children while continuing his job in Thiruvananthapuram.Both Joji and his wife applied for Canadian PR, and once they received it, they didn’t look back. The decision was emotional, but considering the future of their children, they took this bold step.""My daughter missed her mother a lot. We needed money at that time, so my wife had to leave. In Italy, you need to know Italian if you apply for PR. That’s why we chose an English-speaking country, and we chose Canada. My wife is in the medical field, so she easily got PR, and I did a sports massage therapist course. Because of the demand, I got an opportunity too,"" he said.""Now, I have four kids. My daughter is 16, my second child, a son, is 13, and I have twin boys who are six years old,"" he added.""I worked in a private company and then got the opportunity with the Global T20 Canada tournament. That was a big opportunity for me. Later, I got an offer with Cricket Canada, and with the help of the cricket board, I am now travelling to India,"" he said.""Currently, it’s minus 30 degrees in Canada. Cricketers need extra attention in such conditions. We came in the first week of January to Sri Lanka for a practice session to adapt to the climate. We trained there for a whole month,"" he added.",Joji Varghese is travelling with the Canadian team for the T20 World Cup 2026 in India. He met Sanju Samson when India and Canada were scheduled to practice at the Arun Jaitley Stadium in different time slots.

Poll What do you think was the main reason for Australia's T20 World Cup exit? Injuries to key players Poor selection decisions Underperformance of bowlers All of the above

Australia’s shock group-stage exit from the T20 World Cup has sparked widespread outrage, with critics tearing into their bowling depth and branding the campaign “shambolic,” while former spinner Brad Hogg delivered the most damning verdict: “We probably deserve what we’ve got at this stage. ”The 2021 champions were eliminated in Sri Lanka on Tuesday after Zimbabwe sealed qualification when their match against Ireland was washed out, leaving Australia stranded and unable to catch up in the points table.The abrupt exit marks a stunning collapse for one of the tournament heavyweights, undone by injuries, questionable selections and a dramatic dip in performances. The absence of pace trio Pat Cummins, Josh Hazlewood and retired T20 spearhead Mitchell Starc left the attack badly exposed. The Australian said the bowling unit was a “shadow of former glories,” adding that players central to previous success “have fallen off a cliff when the stakes are at their highest. ”Australia’s campaign spiralled further amid fierce criticism of selection decisions, particularly the handling of Steve Smith.Despite strong form, Smith was initially overlooked and only added later as cover. “We still haven't had a compelling answer as to why he wasn't yet in Colombo,” the newspaper wrote, questioning why a proven performer against spin was missing during the crucial defeat to Zimbabwe and later left out again as the middle order collapsed against Sri Lanka.Hogg said the problems exposed deeper structural concerns. “We don't have that bowling depth, and that's really shown,” he told Talksport, warning that selectors must urgently rethink the future. “They've got to look at their depth of bowling… what's our next generation going to look like?”Adding to the humiliation, British broadcaster Piers Morgan mocked Australia’s exit, posting sarcastic condolences online.","Australia's T20 World Cup exit has sparked widespread outrage.

Inside Pakistan’s camp What is the Naqvi problem

As the afternoon flight to Chennai from Colombo was about to take off, there were a lot of Pakistan fans waiting in the queue. Two flights — one to Lahore and the other to Karachi — were scheduled around the same time and you could over-hear their conversations. It was mostly about Pakistan’s chances and how good India are. When TOI asked a few of them what they felt about a rematch with India later in the tournament, a couple of them said, “Inshallah, ho jayega… we will come again if that happens.”That’s the cautious optimism of the fans. But for that to happen again, Pakistan have to do a lot of things right, starting with winning their game against Namibia on Wednesday in Colombo. If they win, or even if there is a washout, they go through to the Super 8s and take on a formidable lineup of New Zealand, Sri Lanka and England. But if they lose, they are out and the USA, who already have a better net run-rate than Pakistan, will go through along with India.Despite the sense of gloom that engulfed the Pakistan contingent on Sunday after the loss to India, there was a silver lining. It was the performance of the two spinners, Usman Tariq and Saim Ayub, who bowl a little bit of everything.Left-arm spinner Mohammed Nawaz was also pretty decent, even though Shadab Khan and Abrar Ahmed were below par.There’s nothing in the Namibia side that should bother Pakistan. But then, given Pakistan’s ability to self-destruct, you can’t take anything for granted.Tariq, who was Pakistan’s best bowler against India, tried to be as positive as possible. “It’s difficult when you don’t work on your mistakes. We just had a conversation about the areas where we had lapses. We’ll work on those and look for-ward to the next matches so that we don’t repeat the same mistakes,” Tariq said on the eve of their game at the SSC.It’s a 3 pm match, the pitch is a slow-turner and the best thing for Pakistan would be to bat first if they win the toss. In a pres-sure game, it will be important for them to have the runs on the board and pressurise the opposition with the spinners.Even though the Pakistan batting is no great shakes, they should manage things against Namibia with some amount of application. The real worry though for the 2009 champions is the form of their best pacer, Shaheen Afridi. He was immensely disappointing against India and the Namibia game can be the right platform for Pakistan to try either Naseem Shah or Salman Mirza, if not both.Tariq, though, defended Afridi, saying that the pacer isn’t under “any special pressure”. “We were just trying to execute our plans. Performances depend on the day. If the bowling unit missed their lines, we’ll focus on those things and work to improve in the next match,” Tariq said. It’s absolutely mandatory that Tariq’s colleagues do that on Wednesday and keep themselves alive in this World Cup.","Pakistan face Namibia on Wednesday in Colombo.

Suryakumar Yadav press conference: How SKY trolled India-Pakistan rivalry

India’s premier all-rounder Hardik Pandya has revisited the turning point of his career, casting his mind back to the dramatic final over against Bangladesh in the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup 2016 that first thrust him into the national spotlight.Tasked with defending 11 runs in the last over, Pandya held his nerve in a finish that remains one of the most unforgettable moments of that tournament. Nearly a decade on, he is now part of India’s squad as a senior figure in their title defence. He believes that night in 2016 laid the foundation for everything that followed.“I think all these moments made me the kind of person I am. There were early challenges in my international career where I had to hold my ground and back myself. It was important to have belief. In cricket, even if there is just a 1% chance, the game is not over until the last ball of the match is bowled.“That Bangladesh match was a classic example of that. One ball before the wicket, the batter had started celebrating as if the game was over. He was celebrating right in front of me, and it was all happening before my eyes.“When things turn around like that, they create wonderful memories. Every time I see it, I think about how, in the early days, that was one of the challenges in my life and one of the moments in my career that shaped Hardik Pandya. I have had many more moments like this, but my journey started with that one,” Pandya said on JioStar.Pandya also described himself as a bowling-first “cricket geek”, admitting that he has not yet fully unlocked his batting ability.After the most recent IPL season, he realised he wanted to push towards his true ceiling as a batter. He also acknowledged the role his girlfriend, Mahieka, played in helping him reconnect with the joy of the sport.“I think the child in me, the cricket geek, who is always there, was focusing more on my skill set as a bowler. I have always had a lot of confidence in my bowling, but batting was very close to my heart.“After the last IPL, I realised that I really wanted to play to Hardik's full potential. I think until now, I haven't utilised more than 40 per cent of my batting potential, and that is genuinely honest feedback.“What I know as a cricketer, what I imagine, what I manifest, and how I practice, have not translated into performance by more than 40 per cent. I took some time in my life to figure out how to bring that out. That's when Mahieka came into my life.“We started talking about the sport and how to bring that child back. She helped me rediscover that excitement for the game that I always had. I went behind the scenes, worked really hard, and had a good amount of batting sessions.“There were days when I was on the ground for six to seven hours. When I went to the NCA, I would go at 3:30 in the afternoon and finish at 12:30 at night. I was usually the last person to leave and shut the lights off,” he added.Those marathon sessions at the NCA in Bengaluru, stretching from mid-afternoon until well past midnight, underline Pandya’s determination to turn potential into performance as he enters the next phase of his international journey.","India's premier all-rounder Hardik Pandya has revisited the turning point of his career, casting his mind back to the dramatic final over against Bangladesh in the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup 2016.

KALYANI: He might no longer be in the national team’s scheme of things. He might not be in BCCI’s central contract list. He might be 35 years old. But Mo-hammed Shami remains a potent force.Shami showed how potent he can be by claiming three wickets to help Ben-gal reduce Jammu and Kashmir to 198 for five at stumps on Day II of the Ranji Trophy semifinal match at the Bengal Cricket Academy (BCA) ground.Resuming the day at 249/5, Bengal lost five wickets for 79 runs to be bowled out for 328 runs, some 45 minutes before the lunch interval. But J&K suffered early jolts when Shami picked up two wickets to reduce the visitors to 13 for two before the lunch interval. The former India international had openers Shubham Khajuria in his second over and Yawer Hassan in his fourth and final over, both the batters were trapped in front.Left-hander Shubham Pundir, how-ever, seemed a bit unlucky to be given out after the batter’s edge looked to have kissed the ground. Veteran Paras Dogra and Abdul Samad then arrested the slide.Samad went on to get his 50 off just 36 balls. Dogra used all his experience to get to his fifty off 95 balls. Finally, Shami broke the 143-run fourth-wicket stand in the fourth delivery as he came back for his second spell. Samad departed for an 85-ball 82. Dogra followed his partner in the first ball of the next over. The J&K skipper got 58 and, in the pro-cess, also completed 10,000 runs in Ranji Trophy. Earlier, Bengal’s Sudip Gharami fell lbw for 146, Auqib Nabi ending up with five for 87.Brief scores: Bengal Ist innings 328 (S Gharami 146, A Easwaran 49, Auqib Nabi 5/87) vs J&K Ist innings 198/5 (Abdul Samad 82, Paras Dogra 58, Shami 3/60).",Shami took three wickets to help Ben-gal reduce Jammu and Kashmir to 198 for five at stumps on Day II of the Ranji Trophy semifinal match at the Bengal Cricket Academy (BCA) ground.

T20 World Cup: How Australia can still qualify for Super 8s

NEW DELHI: A shattered Mitchell Marsh did not hide his emotions after Australia crashed to a crushing eight-wicket defeat against Sri Lanka in a must-win clash at the Pallekele International Cricket Stadium on Monday, conceding his side’s fate in the tournament is now out of their hands.Australia posted 181 after a blazing start but were blown away by a sensational chase led by Pathum Nissanka , whose unbeaten century sealed Sri Lanka’s place in the Super 8s and left the former champions staring at an early exit.“It is a devastated group. We’re in the lap of the gods now, I think, with the way it’s shaped up,” Marsh said in a brutally honest assessment. “There’s a lot of emotion in the rooms right now. We haven’t been at our best… we’re a disappointed bunch at the moment.”At the halfway stage of their innings, Australia looked firmly in control. Marsh (54) and Travis Head (56) powered their side to a commanding 110/2, setting the platform for a massive total. But what followed was a dramatic collapse in momentum, as Sri Lanka’s bowlers tightened the screws.“Well, I thought it was a competitive total at the halfway mark.There’s no doubt we probably left ourselves a few short after the start that we had. So that’s disappointing,” Marsh admitted. “We know that at our best we can make big scores. And we just lost our way a little bit there towards the back-end. Couldn’t get a partnership going and Sri Lanka bowled really well.”He added with resignation: “Coming off, we knew we were a few short… not much else to say other than Sri Lanka outplayed us tonight.”Sri Lanka made Australia pay dearly. Nissanka’s breathtaking 100 not out off just 52 balls turned the chase into a statement, as Australia’s bowlers had no answers on a night when everything seemed to slip away.The defeat marked Australia’s second consecutive loss and left them in a precarious position in Group B. With just one win from three matches, their Super 8 hopes now hinge on other results — particularly the crucial clash between Zimbabwe and Ireland.Marsh admitted the team could only watch and hope.“We watch the Zimbabwe-Ireland game and we hope… but yeah, we’re a disappointed bunch at the moment,” he said.The qualification equation is tense and unforgiving.If Zimbabwe beat Ireland on Tuesday, Australia will be eliminated from the tournament. However, an Ireland victory will keep Australia’s hopes alive and open up a three-way fight for the remaining Super 8 spot.In that scenario, Zimbabwe’s final group match against Sri Lanka on February 19 will become decisive. A Zimbabwe win over the co-hosts will take them through to the Super 8s alongside Sri Lanka, ending Australia’s chances regardless of other results.But if Zimbabwe lose to Sri Lanka — and Ireland have already beaten Zimbabwe — then Zimbabwe and Ireland will both finish on four points, bringing net run rate into play to determine the second qualifier from the group.Australia, who face Oman on February 20 in their final match, will then enter the contest with a clear net run rate equation. They will need a convincing win and a favourable swing in numbers to stay alive and secure a dramatic late qualification.",Sri Lanka beat Australia by eight wickets in their T20 World Cup Group B clash.

With a day to go for the clash against India, the entire discussion around the Pakistani contingent at the Premadasa Stadium was around the fitness of Abhishek Sharma . They forgot a name in the process -- Ishan Kishan While Abhishek has been the crazy diamond of this Indian top-order, Kishan returned from a two-year international exile looking like a rocket-launcher that is ready to destroy anything in its vicinity.The cobwebs of the mind that had affected Ishan when he was dropped and later axed from the contracts list, seem to have been cleared. Ishan looks hungry and fearless, but there’s a method in his approach that is making the wicketkeeper-batter stand out.Those who know Ishan closely indicate that it has a lot to do with channelizing his thoughts in the right direction, and that has made a lot of difference. First off, he has gone back to playing First Class cricket and wants to play Test cricket for India again.He played most of the matches for Jharkhand in this Ranji season, which helped him get the basics of his game right once more. That was followed by his conquests in the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy and the Vijay Hazare Trophy, which brought him right back into contention.It helped Ishan’s cause that Shubman Gill’s T20 form dropped and Sanju Samson became very patchy with the bat.It’s not that Ishan wasn’t a serious threat with the bat in his ‘first innings’. Let’s not forget, he had scored a superb 82 against Pakistan in the 2023 Asia Cup in SSC after a top-order wobble in a game that was eventually washed out. He was there in India’s ODI World Cup side as well, but once he was dropped from the playing XI, things went south for him very fast.Sunday’s 40-ball 77 wasn’t just a case of one good day in the office, a lot of thought and hard work had gone into it. The chief difference between the two Ishans — the one of 2023 and the current 2.0 version — is that he is more judicious in his approach. “I did work a lot on my off-side game, so that I could have them bowl to my area of strengths. Premadasa is a big ground and there was intent to hit the gaps and try to take two runs,” Ishan explained how meticulous his planning was.Captain Surya Kumar Yadav , too, was all praise for the dynamic southpaw. “He has been batting the same way in the last few games and domestic cricket. At 0-1, someone needed to take responsibility and he did that amazingly,” the skipper said.While Ishan was quite superb in the way he batted, there were areas where Pakistan got it wrong with him. Ishan has always been good against left-arm pacers, yet skipper Salman Ali Agha decided to bowl a woefully out-of-form Shaheen Afridi in the second over after dismissing Abhishek with spin in the first over. In his show, Indian spin legend R Ashwin pointed out how it was crucial for Pakistan to use another spinner from the other end.“Somebody like a Saim Ayub could easily have been introduced in the second over against the two left-handers (Ishan and Tilak Varma). Instead they bowled Afridi, who didn’t do anything to bother Ishan,” Ashwin said.It was just the release Ishan was look-ing for as he used the pace of the bowler to hit a couple of big hits and bring the pressure down. Ishan took a heavy toll of Shadab Khan and Abrar Ahmed, who did bowl to him in the Powerplay.Pakistan coach Mike Hesson had an explanation for that, acknowledging that “Ishan is fearless”. “He’s able to score on both sides of the ground, he isn’t just committed to the leg-side. We know he’s incredibly strong there, but he can reverse. So if you’ve got spin, especially in the Powerplay, it can be a challenge. In the form that he is in, Ishan applied a lot of pressure on our spinners and probably took them away from the basics,” Hesson said.The highlight of the match was the 87-run partnership off 46 balls that Ishan shared with Tilak, who is also known to be a destructive southpaw. But the two decided to take contrasting approaches on Sunday. While Ishan took 39 balls in that partnership and scored 76, Tilak contributed only 11 off seven.The Mumbai Indians left-hander explained later how they worked things out. “The ball was coming a little better in Powerplay and the intent that Ishan showed was great. Even I felt like going for the shots, but decided otherwise because of his form. I told him, ‘Bhai tera lag raha hain (Bro, you are striking it well), so you keep hitting, I will take care of the other end and put the ball in the gaps’,” Tilak, who was Man of the Match in the Asia Cup final not too long ago, said.It’s the collective effort that has been the cornerstone of India’s success in recent times in T20 cricket. At some point, Abhishek too will be back in his elements and with Ishan doing what he is, it will need a massive upset to stop the Indian juggernaut in this World Cup.","Ishan Kishan returned from a two-year international exile looking like a rocket- launcher.

The upcoming T20 World Cup Group B fixture between Zimbabwe and Ireland is far more than just another league game — it could decide Australia’s fate and shape the Super 8 line-up.On Monday, Sri Lanka stormed into the Super 8s with a dominant eight-wicket win over Australia. Pathum Nissanka ’s breathtaking unbeaten 100 off 52 balls powered the chase of 182, while the Sri Lankan spinners derailed Australia after a flying 104-run opening stand between Mitchell Marsh (54) and Travis Head (56). The result left Australia teetering on the brink.With three wins in three matches, Sri Lanka have already sealed qualification. Zimbabwe sit second with two wins in two games and a healthy net run rate (NRR) of +1.984. Australia, now third with one win in three matches and an NRR of +0.414, are in serious danger. Ireland, placed fourth with one win in three games (NRR +0.150), are still mathematically alive. Oman are eliminated.The equation is simple yet dramatic.If Zimbabwe beat Ireland, they will qualify for the Super 8s — and Australia will be knocked out of the tournament. However, if Ireland win, the group opens up dramatically. Net run rate will then come into play, with Australia needing a strong victory over Oman and hoping the NRR swings in their favour.Zimbabwe have already shown their pedigree by outplaying Australia earlier in the tournament. But Ireland, fighting for survival, will view this as a golden opportunity.In essence, the Zimbabwe-Ireland clash is a virtual knockout — not just for themselves, but for Australia too.",Zimbabwe and Ireland play each other in Group B of the T20 World Cup.

T20 World Cup | Sitanshu Kotak press conference: 'He has his own plans sorted,' on Abhishek Sharma

AHMEDABAD: India’s path to the T20 World Cup 2026 semifinals became slightly clearer on Tuesday after Australia’s shock group-stage exit. Had Mitchell Marsh’s side advanced, they would have joined India, South Africa and the West Indies in the same Super 8 group. Instead, Sikandar Raza’s Zimbabwe will now face India on Feb 26.While Australia’s early departure may ease the degree of difficulty, India’s camp insists it changes little. Speaking ahead of Wednesday’s final league match against the Netherlands, batting coach Sitanshu Kotak said the team remains focused on defending its title, regardless of opposition.“Everyone was thinking that Australia would qualify and come into our group in the Super 8s. We knew about this possibility too. But when they lost to Zimbabwe, we realised Zimbabwe might end up in our group,” Kotak told reporters. “We knew the match against Sri Lanka would be tough for Australia, looking at the conditions. I don’t think we are bothered about what happened. Either we play Australia, or we play Zimbabwe. We will just try to do our best against whoever we play.” Kotak also threw his weight be-hind Abhishek Sharma, who has registered ducks in his last two ap-appearances.The opener was unwell in the lead-up to the Pakistan game.“He wasn’t well. In the last match he got out in the first over. We don’t overanalyse unnecessarily. He has his plans and knows how he wants to play,” Kotak said. “T20 is such a format — you can lose your wicket. That’s okay.”With India set to play their Super 8 clash against South Africa in Ahmedabad, Kotak underlined the importance of adapting to conditions. “It would be good to get used to the conditions here. Looking at the wicket, we may tweak the playing XI. But the intensity will remain the same,” he said, adding that premier pacer Jasprit Bumrah is unlikely to be rested for the Netherlands game. “We’ll decide later, but I don’t think Bumrah will rest. ”Kotak reserved special praise for Ishan Kishan, whose half-century set up India’s win over Pakistan. “We know how capable Kishan is. He’s very confident and natural.”","India's path to the T20 World Cup 2026 semifinals became slightly clearer on Tuesday after Australia’s shock group-stage exit.

Thomas Draca exclusive: Hardik Pandya, 'special' pendant and T20 World Cup dream

CHENNAI: Chepauk saw the birth of a new star in 19-year-old Yuvraj Singh Samra on Tuesday. The teenager, named after former India star Yuvraj Singh, smashed a 65-ball 110 but it was not enough to stop New Zealand from winning by eight wickets and make the Super 8s.Left-hander Samra (110 off 65b; 11x4, 6x6) became the youngest to score a ton in the T20 World Cup and helped Canada post a competitive 173/4. However, New Zealand, led by stand-in skipper Daryl Mitchell chased down the target with 29 balls to spare. After slipping to 30-2, Glenn Phillips (76* off 36b; 4x4, 6x6) and Rachin Ravindra (59* off 39b; 4x4, 3x6) stitched an unbeaten 146-run stand for the third wicket to take the Kiwis home.The in-form Phillips wasted little time in asserting himself, unleashing a range of strokes while Rachin played second fiddle. Rachin getting back to form will be a major relief for the Kiwis. The left-hander waited for the loose balls to be put away and finished the chase with a boundary.The day, however, belonged to Samra, who held the innings together. He began cautiously before cutting loose in the final over of the Powerplay, collecting 18 runs to lift Canada to 50 for no loss.Jimmy Neesham was at the receiving end as Samra struck three fours and a six. He then went after off-spinner Cole McConchie, who came in for unwell Mitchell Santner, launching two maximums to carry his side past the 100-run mark.NZ finally found the breakthrough they needed. Pacer Kyle Jamieson ended the record 116-run opening stand, with captain’s Dilpreet Bajwa’s lofted drive pouched at deep extra cover by Phillips.Samra showed no signs of slowing down and continued his as-sault, and the youngster received a reprieve on 89 when Matt Henry tipped the ball over the rope at long-off.SCORES: New Zealand 176/2 in 15.1 overs (Phillips 76*, Ravindra 59*; Saad 1-29) beat Canada 173/4 (Samra 110, Bajwa 36, Duffy 1-25) by eight wickets.",New Zealand beat Canada by eight wickets to make the Super 8s.

Inside Pakistan’s camp What is the Naqvi problem

MUMBAI: With both Nepal and Scotland already out of the T20 World Cup, Tuesday night’s contest at the Wankhede was more about playing for pride.In the end, in a match that swayed from one team to an-other and went to the last over, Nepal held their nerve to over-haul the target of 171 with seven wickets and four balls to spare to sign off with their first win of the tournament.After the win, Nepal players went on a lap of honour to oblige the fans who have filled the stands in all four matches they played in Mumbai, irre-spective of the results Nepal’s win was built on a 55-ball, 74-run association for the opening wicket between Kushal Bhurtel (43; 35b; 1x4, 4x6) and Aasif Sheikh (33; 27b; 2x6) before Dipendra Singh Airee (50*; 23b; 4x4, 3x6) and Gulshan Jha’s (24*; 17b; 1x4, 2x6) unbeaten 36-ball, 73-run stand for the third wicket took them over the line.Openers Bhurtel and Sheikh mixed caution with aggression, an approach that made sense as Nepal had failed to stitch open-ing stands against Italy and the West Indies previously. Against Scotland, the pair started to flex their muscles and took 23 runs off the fifth over, bowled by Mark Watt, to put Nepal on their way.Scotland, led by off-spinner Michael Leask (3/20) and left-arm spinner Oliver Davidson (0/31), pulled themselves back into the contest with Leask ac-counting for Bhurtel, Sheikh and skipper Rohit Paudel (16, 14b; 1x4) in each of his first three overs as Nepal scored just 63 runs between overs 6-15.By the 15th over, Nepal were 112/3 and needed 59 off the last five overs. But Airee scored 19 of the 20 conceded by Leask in his last over to settle the nerves.SCORES: Nepal 171/3 in 19.2 overs (D Airee 50*, K Bhurtel 43; M Leask 3/30) beat Scotland 170/7 (M Jones 71; S Kami 3/25).",Nepal beat Scotland by seven wickets with four balls to spare in Mumbai.

Gautam Gambhir works overtime with Tilak Varma in the nets

NEW DELHI: South Africa’s fast-bowling attack for the T20 World Cup may not have the aura of their illustrious predecessors but the duo of Luis Ngidi and Marco Jansen are no less industrious and are proving to be quite a handful in the tournament. However, the Pro-teas seamers are not rattling the batters with raw pace like before. Instead, they are plotting the batters’ downfall with deceptive changes in pace and length in the game’s shortest for-mat. The team plays UAE in their last group-stage match in Delhi on Wednesday, ahead of Sunday’s big-ticket clash against South Africa.With their premium pacer Kagiso Rabada looking well below his best in the first three games, Ngidi and Jansen have risen to the occasion in the group stage. Of the 22 wickets South Africa have claimed in the three matches, the two have shared 15 between them, with Ngidi claiming eight and Jansen seven. More importantly, eight of those wickets claimed by the duo have come in the Powerplay.The duo have refrained from bowling too full and have banked on back-of-a length and good-length deliveries in the initial overs. More importantly, they have used the slower balls judiciously and varied their length.The South African team’s special consultant Albie Morkel gave an insight into their fast bowlers’ thinking on the eve of their game against UAE. “We’ve been based in Ahmedabad, where the wicket has been really good for batting. So as a bowler you don’t have too many options and batters thrive in such conditions.So, it’s all about trying to take that length away, be a little unpredictable to stop them scoring those sixes,” said Albie, brother of India’s bowling coach Morne.He also praised Ngidi. “He’s very good at taking wickets. He has developed a very deceptive slower ball, which he knows when to use and how to use.” The elder of the Morkel brothers also backed Rabada to come good “We’re going to double down on him and back him all the way. I think that’s the only way to go,” he said.","South Africa's fast bowlers Luis Ngidi and Marco Jansen are proving to be quite a handful in the tournament.

Netherlands

A dominant India will be hoping that Abhishek Sharma rediscovers his destructive form and that the rest of the batting lineup steps up against spin when they take on the Netherlands in their final T20 World Cup league match on Wednesday. Despite being one of the most dangerous batters over the past 18 months, Abhishek has yet to make a big impact in the ICC event at home.After a duck in the opener, a stomach infection kept him out against Namibia. He returned for the high-stakes clash with Pakistan but again failed to score.Thankfully, Ishan Kishan’s imperious form at the other end has kept India’s campaign on track. To his credit, Abhishek’s high-risk approach has delivered multiple wins for India, and it may only be a matter of time before he dismantles top bowlers again. Yet, four ducks in his last six innings indicate he might need to rethink his powerplay strategy.With India already through to the Super 8s, the Netherlands game offers the perfect chance to get back among the runs. On the bowling front, India could rest a few players ahead of the next stage, including pace spearhead Jasprit Bumrah. After opting for Kuldeep Yadav over Arshdeep Singh in Colombo, the team is expected to revert to two specialist pacers.If Bumrah is rested, Mohammed Siraj and Arshdeep Singh are likely to open the attack.The India vs Netherlands match will be played on Wednesday, February 18.The match will be played at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad.The match will start at 7:00 PM IST, with the toss scheduled for 6:30 PM IST.The match will be televised live in India on the Star Sports Network.Live streaming will be available on the Jio Hotstar app and website.The match can be followed live on TimesofIndia.com.- Probable XI: Abhishek Sharma, Ishan Kishan, Tilak Varma, Suryakumar Yadav, Rinku Singh, Hardik Pandya, Shivam Dube, Axar Patel, Arshdeep Singh, Jasprit Bumrah, Varun Chakarvarthy- Probable XI: Michael Levitt, Max O'Dowd, Bas de Leede, Colin Ackermann, Scott Edwards, Zach Lion-Cachet, Roelof van der Merwe, Logan van Beek, Aryan Dutt, Paul van Meekeren, Fred Klaasen: Suryakumar Yadav (c), Abhishek Sharma, Tilak Varma, Sanju Samson, Shivam Dube, Ishan Kishan, Hardik Pandya, Arshdeep Singh, Jasprit Bumrah, Mohammed Siraj, Varun Chakaravarthy, Kuldeep Yadav, Axar Patel, Washington Sundar, Rinku Singh.: Scott Edwards (c), Colin Ackermann, Noah Croes, Bas de Leede, Aryan Dutt, Fred Klaassen, Kyle Klein, Michael Levitt, Zach Lion-Cachet, Max O'Dowd, Logan van Beek, Timm van der Gugten, Roelof van der Merwe, Paul van Meekeren, Saqib Zulfiqar.","India take on the Netherlands in their final T20 World Cup league match on Wednesday.

T20 World Cup | Sitanshu Kotak press conference: 'He has his own plans sorted,' on Abhishek Sharma

JAIPUR: The Rajasthan Royals are standing firm on prioritising fan safety ahead of IPL 2026 and will only proceed with hosting home matches at Sawai Mansingh Stadium (SMS) here only if the Rajasthan government provides an indemnity waiver. This formal assurance would protect the franchise from liability in the event of any untoward incident, accident or loss of life during their home games, ensuring accountability remains with the venue authorities for any pre-existing safety shortcomings beyond the Royals’ control.This demand stems directly from a comprehensive 700-page independent audit commissioned by the Royals and conducted by Tata Projects, which assessed the stadium’s condition and identified serious deficiencies.The Rajasthan State Sports Council (RSSC) has largely dismissed most of the audit’s safety concerns, maintaining after its own review that issues are minor and fixable with routine repairs, and that the stadium is fully prepared for IPL duty.A source in the know said that in light of the tragic crowd crush outside Bengaluru’s M Chinnaswamy Stadium in June last year, it is entirely reasonable for the Royals to exercise extreme caution.“It’s obvious to refuse to overlook potential risks at their home venue in the wake of such a recent and devastating incident,” the source said.The BCCI has faced venue uncertainties for both the Royals and Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) ahead of IPL 2026. However, while defending champions RCB have now received formal clearance from the Karnataka government to host their matches at M Chinnaswamy Stadium, Royals continue to be locked in a standoff over their Jaipur base.A BCCI source has underscored ongoing issues at SMS Stadium, calling it ‘significantly lagging behind all other IPL venues in terms of modern facilities, overall fan experience and essential amenities’.The source added that RSSC received a one-time dispensation to host matches in 2024 due to the absence of a functional Rajasthan Cricket Association (RCA), with this extended for 2025, but this cannot become a permanent arrangement.“It’s the franchise, the state cricket body, and the IPL Governing Council that collectively organise and take responsibility for IPL matches. They need to recognise this reality,"" the source added.","The Rajasthan Royals are standing firm on prioritising fan safety ahead of IPL 2026.

Jay Shah’s 2036 Olympic blueprint for India: '8 Medals won’t cut it'

The military will use two types of equipment:

A semi-mobile system that creates a protected zone where no unauthorized drone can fly.

A portable system that a soldier can carry and point at a suspicious drone.

The Mexican military is getting ready to deal with unauthorized drones during this summer’s football World Cup.Mexico is hosting the tournament together with the United States and Canada from June 11 to July 19. On Tuesday, soldiers at a military base in Mexico City showed the anti-drone equipment they plan to use to protect stadiums.The move comes because drug cartels in Mexico have increasingly used drones bought online to attack rivals and sometimes civilians. This has become more common over the past five years.However, most of the cartel violence happens far from the three World Cup host cities: Mexico City, Guadalajara, and Monterrey. These cities will host 13 matches during the tournament.""(Drone prevention) is going to be focused in the stadiums and where there are crowds, which could be the 'Fan Fest' events, or any point where there are meetings of people,"" army Captain Jose Alfredo Lara, a communications and electronics engineer, told AFP.Once the military team locates a drone, it cuts off the pilot's communication with the apparatus. ""The device loses control and won't be able to come close,"" Lara explained.This causes the drone to lose control and prevents it from getting close. Depending on how it is set up, the drone may return to its operator, try to leave the blocked area, or crash.Several major criminal groups in Mexico, including the Sinaloa Cartel, Cartel Jalisco Nueva Generacion, and La Familia Michoacana, are known to use drones. Their activity is mostly reported in states like Michoacan, Chihuahua, and Guanajuato.Last October, drones carrying homemade explosives attacked state prosecutor offices in Tijuana, a city near the US border.The Mexican military says these new security measures are meant to reduce the risk of drone attacks during the World Cup and keep fans safe.",Mexico is hosting the tournament together with the United States and Canada from June 11 to July 19.

After scoring early in the second half with a powerful shot into the top corner, Vinicius celebrated by dancing in front of the home fans and was given a yellow card.Soon after, Benfica’s Gianluca Prestianni appeared to say something to him. Vinicius reported to the referee, Francois Letexier, that he had been called “mono” (Spanish for monkey). The game was stopped for several minutes, and Vinicius was later booed by the crowd.Benfica coach Jose Mourinho was sent off late in the game for protesting too strongly. This means he will miss the second leg in Madrid. Despite 12 minutes of added time, Benfica could not equalise and now face a tough task in the return match.""(What happened) is something that nobody likes, you have to ask the Benfica player what he said,"" Real coach Alvaro Arbeloa told broadcaster Movistar.""(Racism) is something we have to eradicate from the world of football and if the players don't fix it then this is very complicated.""In another match, Paris Saint-Germain came back from two goals down to beat AS Monaco 3-2.Folarin Balogun scored twice in the first 18 minutes to give Monaco a strong start.PSG missed a penalty through Vitinha, and Ousmane Dembele went off injured.But substitute Desire Doue changed the game.

Dance, drums and fun! Team India land in Colombo | Hardik Pandya with Mahieka Sharmaindia arrival-

Kolkata: Some wobbles, some worries and in the end Mohun Bagan Super Giant got just what the doctor ordered — a 2-0 win over Kerala Blasters to start their defence of the ISL title here on Saturday.Jamie Maclaren put Sergio Lobera’s side in front in the 36th minute and Tom Aldred came off the bench to head home the second goal to polish the victory up deep into injury time.However, it was not the kind of rise-and-shine moment the 30,000-odd fans present at the stands would love to be thrilled with.The defending champions’ path to victory was strewn with some avoidable potholes here and there, something which one might be tempted to attribute to their opening match rustiness and ineptitude.It was Petratos who had a direct role in breaking the deadlock. The Bagan No. 9, receiving the ball inside the box from Apuia, laid it off quickly for fellow Australian Maclaren, who steered clear of Aiban Dohling’s challenge with a sharp turn to beat the goalkeeper Sachin Suresh with a left-footed low volley. Bagan thereafter had more possession and more territory, but they couldn’t control the opponents, who looked more ambitious in the second half, especially with the arrival of Kevin Yoke.Sensing the problem, Lobera introduced Aldred in the 81st minute, taking off Petratos. Defender Aldred calmed the nerves for his team, rising to the occasion to meet Anirush Thapa’s free-kick and beating the Blasters goalkeeper for the second time. It also ensured a perfect start to the Lobera reign at the club as the Spaniard has now kept the record of a winning debut in the ISL for all four clubs he has managed so far.",Mohun Bagan Super Giant beat Kerala Blasters 2-0 in ISL opener.

New signings Mehtab Singh, Robson Da Silva, and Amey Ranawade were the fresh faces in the whole match day squad. On the other hand, David Catala named a young lineup in his first ISL match, with foreign signings Oumar Ba and Victor Bertomeu making their debuts alongside midfielders Y Ebindas and Rowllin Borges, as per an ISL press release.The defending champions had the better possession in the first half, with Anirudh Thapa and Lalengmawia Ralte (Apuia) controlling the midfield, allowing Robson and Liston Colaco to find space to attack through the wings.Dimi Petratos returned to his preferred No. 10 role behind Jamie Maclaren, and the Australian almost gave his side an early lead. Liston Colaco found Petratos inside the box, but the forward snatched his shot, which went wide of the goal.The Mariners were dominating possession, but were finding it difficult to break down the stubborn defence of Kerala Blasters. They did manage to take the lead after the water break through Jamie Maclaren. He was found inside the box by Petratos, and the Aussie striker turned Aiban Dohling and found the net through a composed left-footed finish for the first goal of the ISL season. Mohun Bagan ended the first half with the one goal lead registering ten shots on goal with six on target at the end of the half.Catala made two changes in the start of the second half, bringing in Naocha Singh and Marlon Trujillo while Subhasish Bose was replaced by Amey Ranawade for Mohun Bagan. The second half also saw the Mariners being comfortable with the ball, maintaining possession for long periods to force the Blasters to defend deep in their own half.Kerala Blasters became stronger in the final quarter of the game, especially with the introduction of Kevin Yoke, who showed his pace and dribbling abilities down the wings, but could not muster any clear-cut chances to trouble Vishal Kaith in goal.

Hours before the truncated Indian Super League (ISL) season gets underway on Saturday, it became official that FanCode had sub-licensed the linear TV rights to Sony Pictures Network India (SPNI). Under the agreement, as reported by TimesofIndia.com , Sony Sports Network will hold exclusive TV broadcast rights for India and non-exclusive rights for Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Maldives, Nepal, and Sri Lanka. The position on international broadcast, however, is still in the works.All 91-matches will be telecast on Sony Ten 2 and pushed to other channels too if there is a double header at the same time.This is not the first time Sony Sports Network and FanCode will work together. Both platforms carried tennis' French Open in 2025 with Sony retaining the primary broadcast and sub-licensing the streaming aspect of all courts to Dream Sports-owned FanCode.Last year, a similar ploy was employed between Sony Sports and JioHotstar for cricket's India tour of England. Under those terms, Sony kept the television broadcast rights while JioHotstar was responsible for the digital streaming.""The macro observation on this is (that) there's so much opportunity (in the sports industry). (It) is so large that honestly there's just so much to be done in the industry that collaboration is probably more apt at this moment than competition because there's so much opportunity,"" explained FanCode co-founder Yannick Colaco of the sub-licensing strategy""And the way we look at it is very clear. We are a digital-first platform. So the two things that are unique about Fancode is (that) we are digital first and we are sports only.""Our product, our approach has always been focused on technology, focused on experience, focused on how we are available across 11 operating systems, focused on innovation on the digital side. And we neither have, nor (a) desire, to have any focus on building a linear TV business.""So when you look at those two unique pieces, there is tremendous opportunity to collaborate with other large media companies, which have a much bigger mandate and ambit. Very politely, we are a much smaller player in this overall media landscape.""And I think that's the way we look at it in the sense that while younger audiences are all digital first, and even some of the older audiences are migrating to digital, there is still a large audience which consumes sports content on linear television.""So when we're working with partners like the AIFF (All India Football Federation) and the ISL, we're very conscious of the fact that to help the sport grow, help the event be successful, give it maximum amount of distribution, we need to be collaborating with partners who have the linear TV presence so that we are able to reach out and basically able to reach out to all sports fans and all ISL fans across the country,"" he continued.Less than two weeks ago, FanCode acquired the broadcast rights -- linear TV and digital -- for the ISL at Rs 8.62 crore. Even though the company has presence only in digital streaming space, it consciously bid for both aspects knowing there were few, if any, players interested in just the linear TV rights.During conversations between FanCode, AIFF and the ISL interim committee, the provider made it clear they wanted to help ensure the top-division football was showcased to as many viewers as possible.After officially bagging the rights, the company entered into conversations with multiple national providers and even some regional ones.""We immediately started speaking to a bunch of people about this, including regional broadcasters, and we took a bunch of proposals that we got, we put them all together. We shared them with the AIFF and the interim committee. We got on a call with them. I shared the pros and cons of each one with them. And on that basis, a decision was made to accept Sony's proposal,"" said Colaco.While that was happening, FanCode also spoke to ISL club representatives to understand their expectations on how to improve the product. It was at this stage that the concept of each club's 'superfan' recording visuals behind the scenes came into being.ISL will have commentary in English, Hindi, Malayalam, Bengali and Tamil (only for Chennaiyin matches).Doing all this, why give away market share to a competitor like Sony Sports?""I'm making it easier for people who prefer to watch the game on linear television to watch it. And yes, (if it comes) at the cost of us also, that's okay. I think it's important to think consumer first. So I believe that eventually our product is what will give users the choice and deliver a great experience. And if it's good enough, which I hope it is, and I believe it is, consumers will come,"" reasoned Colaco.""I don't think it should be forced and that's always what we (have) believed. And I also think that you know a partner like Sony will help in raising the promotion levels and contribute (to the) marketing. (As the saying goes) A rising tide lifts all boats,"" he added.On their part, Sony Sports Network, who had attended the pre-bid conference for the broadcast rights but chose not to make a final bid, sees this as an opportunity to add to their football portfolio which is largely led by European competitions.""While we were keen to add ISL to our sports portfolio, back then, we needed more time to evaluate the property before putting in our financial offer,"" said Rajesh Kaul, Chief Revenue Officer and Business Head - Sports and International, SPNI,Yet this won't be their first foray into Indian football having previously showcased the I-League and Durand Cup.""Our aim is to cater to football fans and expand the football ecosystem in India. Sony Pictures Networks India is the Home of Football in India and we have a diverse and expansive portfolio of both International and Indian football properties that includes UEFA EURO 2028, the UEFA Champions League, UEFA Europa League, UEFA Nations League, Bundesliga, FA Cup along with India’s very own legacy tournament Durand Cup. Last year, we were also the official broadcasters of I-League which is also homegrown football league,"" he stated.","FanCode sub-licensed the linear TV rights to Sony Pictures Network India. Sony Sports Network will hold exclusive TV broadcast rights for India and non- exclusive rights for Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Maldives, Nepal, and Sri Lanka. All 91-matches will be telecast on Sony Ten 2 and pushed to other channels too if there is a double header.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128338674,imgsize-56580,width-400,resizemode-4/fancode-sony.jpg"

Jay Shah’s 2036 Olympic blueprint for India: '8 Medals won’t cut it'

Kolkata: The wait is over. The Indian football season is finally here but not, perhaps, at a time ideal enough to fall head over heels with it, especially after the way the game has been left gasping in search of clarity, continuity and identity. As Mohun Bagan SG begin their title defence of an abridged version of the Indian Super League against Kerala Blasters here on Saturday, Indian football is facing a strange transition.True, every transition has its own turbulence, but this season seems to be more about unshackling a state of sterility than setting in motion a long haul.Change, though, remains the popular catchword — both as a contradictory and complementary force. For the first time since the league’s inception in 2014, it’s now in the hands of the national federation.But in this change of guard, issues remain and unintended consequences threaten to emerge with the end of the Master Rights Agreement between the AIFF and Reliance-owned Football Sports Development Limited.How the entire ISL ecosystem has bled in this period of uncertainty is there for everyone to see, and shudder.Holders Mohun Bagan are beginning a new life replacing last season’s ISL Shield and Cup-winning coach Jose Molina with another successful and veteran Spaniard Sergio Lobera.“Pressure? Yes, there’s pressure. I think if you don’t feel pressure, it means you don’t need to fight for big targets. I know I am in a winning team, in a champion’s team. I know what is my responsibility and I am very excited about this responsibility,” Lobera remarked during his match-eve media interaction on Friday.Lobera has reasons to be optimistic as the might of Mohun Bagan looks too formidable to be rooted out easily. Because even in this period of chaos and uncertainty, they have the luxury of assembling the players and training for the past couple of months.Kerala Blasters, on the other hand, represent everything about the detrimental effect of this confusing and trying time. They had to part company with their entire force of foreigners including the veterans like Noah Sadoui, Jesus Jimenez and Adrian Luna and new coach David Catala has a job on his hands with the arrival of a new quintet of overseas players with no experience of playing in Indian conditions.‘We have come here with just 14 days of preparation and it’s not enough,” Catala said.“We’re up against a team which has been training all this time when we didn’t know what would happen to us. It is true that we are going to be the underdog team, but in football anything can happen,” the Blasters coach added.Constrained by financial instability, the state of play has seen several clubs go the Blasters’ way, with FC Goa’s David Timor, Iker Guarrotxena and Borja Herrera, Mumbai City FC’s Tiri and Bengaluru FC’s Edgar Mendez being some familiar faces bidding forced goodbyes to Indian football while Durand Cup champions North-East United FC have loaned out Alaeddine Ajaraie — the best player of the ISL’s 2024-2025 season — to Persija Jakarta in the Indonesian league.","Mohun Bagan SG begin their title defence of an abridged version of the Indian Super League against Kerala Blasters here on Saturday.

Ilia Malinin finds strength in support from Tom Brady and other icons after Olympic setback



Tom Brady reached out when Ilia Malinin needed perspective most, offering quiet support after an Olympic moment that unraveled in public view. The message came at the right time. Malinin had just endured the kind of performance athletes replay in their minds, searching for answers that do not come easily.The disappointment was sharp because the expectations were real. He arrived in Italy carrying the weight of gold medal hopes. He left the individual event without a podium finish. Yet in the middle of that emotional fallout, encouragement from some of sport’s most accomplished names reminded him that even the best face days like this.When Ilia Malinin spoke with Mike Tirico, he did not hide how much the moment hurt. “Of course, following the free skate, it was a little hard at first, trying to realize what happened and how devastating it really was,” he said. The mistakes were costly. Once seen as a favorite for gold at the 2026 Winter Olympics, he finished eighth after multiple falls.What came next surprised him.“Looking back at it, I got so much love, so much support; everyone was there for me,” he added.“Had so many different people reach out to me. Tom Brady, Steph Curry, Simone Biles, Snoop [Dogg]. I’m honestly just so honored for that, and I feel like it just made my day, honestly.”Hearing from Tom Brady, Stephen Curry, Simone Biles, and Snoop Dogg carried weight. They understood pressure. They understood public disappointment. Their words gave Malinin perspective he could not find on his own.The free skate itself felt unfamiliar from the start. “I was not expecting it to feel that way, but definitely getting on that ice, it felt like... Usually, I feel like I'm in control and everything just lines up where it should be,” he said. “But that time, it really just felt like it was speeding ahead of me, and I didn't have time to catch up and get back together.”He found comfort in Biles’ journey. Her struggle with the twisties and her return to Olympic glory showed him that setbacks do not define the ending. “She just had to get through there and understand what happened to not have that happen in the future, honestly,” he said.There was also something to hold on to. His decision to compete in the team event helped deliver gold. “It's definitely something that will help me not feel the worst from my Olympic experience and really just shows how grateful I should be for even stepping on the ice for that team event,” he shared. “We just fought and put so much energy and all of it into that skate. It's what gave us this gold medal, and I'm never going to forget that. ”The exhibition gala still awaits. So does the rest of his career. The disappointment remains real. So does the belief that this is not the last Olympic chapter he will write.","Ilia Malinin finished eighth in the men's free skate at the Winter Olympics.

Tyreek Hill reunion: why Kansas City is considering it, and what stands in the way



Tyreek Hill's reunion talk arrives just when the Kansas City Chiefs need hope the most. A year ago, the idea would have sounded nostalgic. Today, it feels almost necessary. Kansas City is coming off a bruising 6 and 11 season, their first playoff absence in a decade, and the offense never found its old fear factor. Suddenly, a familiar name is back in their orbit, carrying both risk and promise.Tyreek Hill’s availability follows a dramatic roster reset by the Miami Dolphins, who released the veteran wide receiver to clear cap space. It cracked open a door few expected to reopen. For a franchise searching for identity and explosion, the timing is impossible to ignore. Kansas City has seen what Hill can do when everything clicks. Now the question is whether they are willing to believe in that version of him again.Tyreek Hill instantly becomes the most intriguing option on the market because of both history and need. His chemistry with Patrick Mahomes once powered the league’s most feared offense. Between 2018 and 2021, they turned broken plays into touchdowns and routine throws into chaos for defenses. Kansas City has not fully replaced that presence since he left.The market is already reacting. Kalshi listed Kansas City among the favorites to land Hill. “Trending: The Broncos and Chiefs are the two strongest favorites to sign free agent receiver Tyreek Hill, per @Kalshi,” the JPA account posted to X. “Denver has a 74% chance, with Kansas City at a 55% chance. Who will sign @cheetah?” The Denver Broncos lead the race, while the Pittsburgh Steelers and New York Giants trail behind.Still, this is not a simple reunion tour. Hill’s season ended brutally after a knee dislocation and torn ACL against the New York Jets. Recovery from that kind of injury usually takes close to a year. He is also nearing 32, an age when speed receivers often face difficult physical realities.Money matters too. Hill previously signed a massive extension in Miami, and even now, his price will reflect his reputation. Kansas City must balance sentiment with sustainability, especially during a roster reset.Yet the upside remains hard to dismiss. Even coming off injury, Hill’s acceleration and instincts make him one of football’s most dangerous players after the catch. His presence alone would reshape defensive game plans.There is also the emotional pull. A healthy Mahomes, Hill, and Travis Kelce once delivered a championship and defined an era. Bringing them back together, even briefly, would not just be about production. It would be about restoring belief inside a locker room that suddenly looks vulnerable.For Kansas City, this decision will reveal how they see their future. Whether they lean on memories or move on entirely could define the next phase of the franchise.","Tyreek Hill's availability follows a dramatic roster reset by the Miami Dolphins.

Mike Evans will return for 2026: What's the best landing spot for the WR,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/mike-evans-will-return-for-2026-whats-the-best-landing-spot-for-the-wr/articleshow/128486408.cms,"Mike Evans clears up status for 2026 (Getty Images)

Mike Evans free agency : Why 2026 could reshape his career and where he might land



Mike Evans is facing something he has never known in the NFL. For the first time, the veteran wide receiver is headed toward unrestricted free agency. His agents confirmed to ESPN’s Kimberly A. Martin that he plans to keep playing in 2026 and will test the open market once his current deal expires. It is a simple update on paper. In reality, it signals the possible end of one of the league’s longest and most productive team player partnerships.For more than a decade, Evans has been the identity of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers passing game. Drafted seventh overall in 2014 out of Texas A&M, he grew into the franchise’s all time leader in receptions, yards, and touchdowns. His consistency placed him alongside Jerry Rice as the only players to open their careers with 11 straight 1,000 yard seasons. That rare company speaks to his level. It also explains why his next decision carries weight across the league.The timing is complicated. Mike Evans is coming off a 2025 season interrupted by hamstring and clavicle injuries and a concussion, limiting him to eight games. He finished with 368 yards, still productive in stretches but short of his usual standard.At 32, teams will study both his résumé and his health before making offers.A return to Tampa Bay remains realistic. The Buccaneers still have structure and stability. Quarterback Baker Mayfield has given the offense balance, and the team has reached the playoffs in five of the last six seasons. Familiarity matters, especially for a player who has never worn another uniform. If the numbers make sense, continuity could win.Elsewhere, contenders will call. The New England Patriots stand out as a logical destination. Pairing Evans with Stefon Diggs would give young quarterback Drake Maye two proven targets. The presence of Coach of the Year Mike Vrabel only strengthens the appeal. For a veteran chasing meaningful games, that environment checks important boxes.The Buffalo Bills offer another intriguing path. Quarterback Josh Allen has been searching for a true No. 1 option since Diggs left. Buffalo’s offense lacked a dominant receiver last season, and Evans, even now, fits that profile. His size, experience, and scoring history could give Allen the reliable presence he has missed.Mike Evans has caught 108 touchdowns, earned six Pro Bowl selections, and helped deliver a championship. Few receivers reach free agency with that kind of history. What comes next will not erase what he built in Tampa. It will simply add a new chapter, one shaped by choice rather than draft position.",Tampa Bay Buccaneers wide receiver Mike Evans is headed toward unrestricted free agency.

New York Jets owner Woody Johnson under fire as leaked NFLPA grades expose controversial food cuts,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/new-york-jets-owner-woody-johnson-under-fire-as-leaked-nflpa-grades-expose-controversial-food-cuts/articleshow/128484046.cms,"An arbitration ruling tied to NFLPA team report cards exposed harsh player criticism of New York Jets owner Woody Johnson, who received the league’s only “F” grade. Complaints cited leadership issues, facility investment concerns, and controversial food budget cuts, including firing a longtime dietitian. The leak triggered backlash from players and legends like J.J. Watt, fueling debate over transparency and workplace standards.

Jets ownership scrutiny intensifies after leaked grading details

The fight over transparency inside NFL locker rooms has spilled into public view, and this time the spotlight has landed squarely on ownership. A recently released arbitration ruling tied to the NFL Players Association’s annual team report cards exposed harsh player feedback about workplace conditions. While the league successfully pushed to keep the report cards private, the ruling itself revealed what players had been saying behind closed doors.At the center of the controversy is New York Jets owner Woody Johnson, who received the lowest ownership grade in the league. According to details outlined in the ruling, players voiced frustration over leadership decisions, facility investment concerns, and changes that they believe made daily working conditions worse rather than better.The NFLPA’s internal evaluation gave Woody Johnson an “F” grade and a 5.58 out of 10 rating, citing “perceived top leadership issues” and “top-down problems.” Players indicated that concerns about ownership direction and resource allocation continue to affect morale and performance.The ruling also revealed specific grievances tied to player welfare. Complaints centered on cuts to the team’s food program and the decision not to retain a long-time dietitian, moves that reportedly followed earlier criticism about nutrition standards.“The Union said Players complained that ‘management responded to feedback [from prior Team Report Cards] by making conditions worse,’ including cutting the food budget and not retaining a long-time dietician after poor food grades the prior year,” the ruling shared by NBC Sports revealed.These revelations reinforce a broader narrative surrounding the Jets’ struggles. The franchise has not returned to the playoffs since its 2010 AFC Championship appearance and has endured a string of losing seasons, fueling concerns about organizational direction.The NFL’s attempt to limit public release of the report cards has also sparked debate among current and former players. Hall of Fame defensive end J.J. Watt openly criticized the decision, arguing that players are constantly evaluated in public while owners avoid similar scrutiny.“NFL won’t let actual players grade the workplace they attend every single day, but they’ll allow a 3rd party ‘grading’ service to display their ‘rankings’ of players on national television every Sunday night,” Watt wrote on X.As the league continues to defend its stance, the leaked findings have reignited discussion about accountability, workplace standards, and whether player voices should carry more weight in shaping team environments.","An arbitration ruling tied to NFLPA team report cards exposed harsh player criticism of Jets owner Woody Johnson.

Travis Kelce's flower bouquets reveal why and how he is counting down to Taylor Swift wedding day

Travis Kelce's flower bouquets plan is turning a private countdown into something deeply personal for Taylor Swift . What has stayed mostly behind closed doors is now taking shape through quiet gestures rather than public statements. The Travis Kelce approach, as described by an insider, is less about spectacle and more about building emotion day by day. Their engagement, announced on August 26, 2025, set the clock ticking. What happens between now and the vows may matter just as much.The couple has kept details close, even as speculation around a summer 2026 ceremony grows louder. Swift’s Rhode Island home has surfaced often in those conversations. Yet the real story may not be about the venue at all. It may be about the waiting period, and how Kelce plans to fill it with reminders that feel intimate and lasting.According to a source, Kelce has mapped out a precise schedule tied to the final 100 days before the wedding. The insider claimed, “Starting 100 days before the big day - then again at 50 days, 30 days, and every day during the final month — he will have flower bouquets delivered to her.”It is not a random idea. It is structured, intentional, and meant to build anticipation rather than arrive all at once.The flowers themselves carry meaning. They are not generic arrangements picked in a rush. The insider told the outlet, “She’ll receive all her favorite flowers: roses in many colors, hydrangeas, and orchids. He wants her to feel overwhelmed in the best possible way - surrounded by one of the things she loves most in life: flowers and their sweet scent.” That choice reflects how closely Kelce has paid attention to Swift’s preferences.This fits a pattern. Earlier, Kelce reportedly spent heavily on Valentine’s Day gifts, including luxury watches and designer pieces. One item alone, a Rolex, was valued at $33,600. Altogether, the reported total reached $141,000. The spending made headlines, but the motivation seemed consistent. The insider revealed that Kelce wanted to make their last Valentine’s Day as an engaged couple “unique and special. ”Flowers, though, land differently. They do not carry the same flash as a watch or designer label. They fade. They need replacing. That may be the point. Each delivery marks time passing. Each bouquet is temporary, but the pattern builds something that lasts longer.There has been no official confirmation of the wedding date or location. Still, if this plan unfolds as described, Kelce is shaping the weeks before the ceremony with care. Not through one grand moment, but through many small ones that lead, quietly and steadily, to the altar.","Travis Kelce's flower bouquets plan is turning a private countdown into something deeply personal for Taylor Swift.

Viral posts fuel debate over Taylor Swift, Travis Kelce, and past relationships

A controversial social media exchange is heating up the debate regarding Taylor Swift and the relationship with Travis Kelce as the internet commentary moves outside pop culture criticism and into personal attack and relationship conjecture. What started as denunciations of the Swift song writing subjects soon turned into a wider assertion of her relationships of the past and her image in front of the world, eliciting a vigorous response of both supporters and opponents.The scandal acquired traction when a viral post accused Swift of attacking individuals in her music as she questioned the accounts of a previous relationship that Kelce had with Kayla Nicole.One widely shared post read: “WHAT IS UP WITH TAYLOR SWIFT’S PATHOLOGICAL NEED TO INSULT PEOPLE IN HER SONGS???Girl you don’t even know this woman—why are you publicly belittling her relationship with Travis and accusing her of being the reason it tanked?And yes I still think the “sleepless in the onyx” reference in “Opalite” was a double entendre race reference. Taylor probably thinks it’s oh-so-clever and subtle but it’s not.Add this to her public outing of Matty Healy’s pill relapse and her belittling of Joe Alwyn’s depression (on top of all the other people she’s shaded over the years) …And then remember how she called Justin Baldoni a bitch and colluded with Blake Lively to hurt him …And what you’ve got is a pretty awful woman.”The post drew thousands of reactions, with some users pushing back while others expanded the discussion to Kelce’s previous relationship. One reply that gained traction stated:“Travis DUMPED this woman one year and 4 months before meeting Taylor. Kayla had a surprise birthday party for Brittany Mahomes and dinner party for her birthday trying to get back with Travis. Showing up at events, phone calls, drove the man crazy. She is a stalker.""The exchange highlights how celebrity relationships often become battlegrounds for fan loyalty and speculation. Although the lyrics and social life of Swift have always been a topic of debate, the severity of the discussions in the online press is an indication of increased scrutiny around her relationship with Kelce.Neither Swift nor Kelce has so far responded to the viral claims. But the episode highlights the speed at which social media stories can be re-imagined to influence the minds of people and that personal interactions can be transformed into trending flashpoints, which are much bigger than music or football.","Viral posts fuel debate over Taylor Swift, Travis Kelce, and past relationships.

Robert Woods retires as a Ram after signing a 1-day contract

Robert Woods is finishing his football journey where many of his most meaningful moments unfolded. The old wide receiver contracted a one-day agreement in the Los Angeles Rams and thus the veteran succeeded in retiring in his own uniform, which brought him the glory of his career to date. There is a reputation of toughness, versatility, and silent leadership that underlines his 33 years in the NFL and sends him away, not flash of headlines, when he walks out of the game.To Rams fans, Woods embodied a certain level of reliability in the era of change in Los Angeles. In the seasons of 2017-2021, he was made a key element of the offense of Sean McVay, providing consistent production and taking up blocking roles and self-sacrificing positions that do not always appear in the highlights reels. His homecoming to pay tribute to his former teammates, coaches, and fans that considered his dedication to his job more than the account numbers, illustrates the relationship he created with them.Robert Woods announced his retirement with an emotional message reflecting on the journey that began long before his NFL debut.""After 27 unforgettable years of pouring my heart into this game, and 13 incredible years in the NFL — it's time for me to step away from playing the sport that has given me everything,"" Woods wrote on Instagram.""Football has never just been a game to me — it has been my passion, my purpose, and my lifelong dream. I cherished every moment my cleats touched the grass. Every time I stepped onto the field, I was determined to leave a piece of myself in every snap.""I always wanted my presence to be felt — by my teammates, by my opponents, by everyone watching. I competed with everything I had, willing to do whatever it took to finish the job and bring home the win. Lifting the Lombardi Trophy and becoming a Super Bowl champion was the dream I held onto as a child, and having the blessing to reach two and win one in 2022 is something I will treasure forever.""Woods was drafted by the Buffalo Bills in 2013 and then discovered his footing in Los Angeles, where he was able to make 367 receptions, 4,626 yards and 23 touchdowns in five seasons with the Rams. He aided in driving an offence that went to two Super Bowls and won the championship in the 2021 season.Following his time at the Rams, Woods enjoyed a short time with the Tennessee Titans and the Houston Texans, and a brief time with the Pittsburgh Steelers before being released in 2025. He retires with 683 receptions, 8,233 yards, and 38 touchdowns, placing him among the most dependable receivers of his era and ninth in Rams history in catches.Woods leaves the game much the way he played it.

In a 2024 interview that quickly went viral among the insiders of the sports and pop communities, Travis Kelce provided an overtly candid account of his early interactions with Taylor Swift . In an episode of the Bussin With the Boys podcast, the tight end of the Kansas City Chiefs explained how when she saw Swift in the stressful setting of NFL game days, she realized that there is a different side of her that people do not get to see. Rather than leaning into celebrity privilege, she chose to blend into the crowd and share the experience with his inner circle.Kelce explained that her calm presence in a chaotic spotlight helped him see her authenticity up close. The pop superstar’s willingness to skip VIP treatment and instead sit with family and friends made a lasting impression. For Kelce, those moments mattered more than the headlines or camera flashes.""I think that's why I started to really fall for her, was how genuine she is around friends, family,” he said. “It can get crazy for somebody with that much attention and she just keeps it so chill and so cool.”Kelce recalled being surprised during her first game appearance when she declined special arrangements. ""The first game she came to, against the Bears, I was like, 'OK, I could probably set you up with everything,’” he said.“And she just walked right through the front door. There's no going down or talking to security. She was like, 'I just want to be around the family and friends and experience this with everybody.'""He added, “She got beaucoup points for that. I was like, ‘Damn, she's in the madness. She wants to support me and do things like that.' She really won me over with that one.""The admiration flows both ways. Kelce has attended multiple Eras Tour shows and even joined Swift onstage in London, describing the concerts as “electric” and praising her command of the stage. Beyond the spectacle, he has spoken about taking pride in their relationship while protecting its most personal parts.""You want to keep things private, but at the same time, I'm not here to hide anything, you know? That's my girl. That's my lady,” he said, “I'm proud of that. I'm not sitting here trying to juggle, ‘How am I going to keep this under wraps?’ You just don't want to let everybody into your personal life and be able to to comment on it, knowing that everything she does is getting a headline.""By sharing these details, Kelce framed their romance not as a celebrity spectacle but as a relationship grounded in loyalty, comfort, and mutual respect.","Travis Kelce shared that he began falling for Taylor Swift after seeing her genuine, down-to-earth behavior at Chiefs games.

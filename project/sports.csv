Poll What do you think is the main reason for Harendra Singh's resignation? Personal reasons Player grievances Team performance issues Excessive training schedules

MARIJNE IN CONTENTION

CHENNAI: In a surprising development, Indian women’s senior team coach Harendra Singh rendered his resignation on Monday with immediate effect. Harendra, under whom the team trained even over the weekend, has cited personal reasons for his sudden departure, in the middle of a national camp at the SAI, South Centre in Bengaluru.While Harendra remained incommunicado, in a statement released by Hockey India (HI), the Dhronacharya awardee stated, “ Coaching the Indian women’s hockey team has been a privilege that has been a highlight of my career. Though personal reasons call me to step away, my heart remains with this extraordinary team and their ongoing success. I will always cherish my journey with Hockey India and continue to support their efforts to take Indian hockey to the highest levels of achievement. ”Harendra, who has been a part of the Indian coaching system since 1997, had earlier coached the women’s national team during the 2017-18 period. He returned after coaching the USA men’s team to take over the reins here in April last year.Under him, India lifted the Asian Champions Trophy last year, but the highs were overshadowed by a string of disappointments. The team was relegated from the Pro League after managing just two wins and three draws in 16 matches, and their loss in the Asia Cup final cost them a direct berth to next year’s World Cup.His abrupt exit, however, comes amid simmering tensions within the camp and claims that he did not inform the team about his decision before it was made public.Multiple sources confirmed to TOI that a section of players had flagged concerns to officials from SAI’s TOPS scheme and had recently written to both HI and the sports ministry. Their complaints centred around allegedly gruelling training schedules that, they claimed, had resulted in injuries to nearly a dozen players—many of whom are now in rehabilitation, lengthy team meetings and favoritism.Adding fuel to the players’ claims was Hockey India’s top brass suddenly descending in Bengaluru from Chennai, where they were overseeing the FIH Junior Hockey Men’s World Cup.TOI has learnt that HI president, Dilip Tirkey and Bhola Nath Singh met the players on Monday and there was a split opinion about Harendra among them, adding meat to the theory that groupism and infights are affecting the team.Harendra’s exit puts a huge question mark on the future of the Indian team, which has failed to raise its game after the fourth-place finish at the Tokyo Olympics.According to HI sources, the hunt for a new coach has begun and is likely to be finalised by the end of the month. The frontrunner for the post is former chief coach Sjoerd Marijne, who stepped down after the Tokyo Games in 2021 and later released a controversial book on Indian hockey.Until a new coach is appointed, the team’s analytical coach Dave Smolenaars is expected to be in charge. The camp ends on Dec 7 and after a short break, the players will head for the Hockey India League.Tirkey, acknowledging Harendra's contributions, said, ""We thank Harendra Singh for his services and his exemplary experience. His commitment towards the development of Indian hockey is well-known across the hockey community. We will announce a suitable replacement soon.""",Harendra Singh resigns as head coach of Indian women's hockey team. He has cited personal reasons for his sudden departure.

'Emotions run high': 2011 World Cup winner’s blunt reminder to Gautam Gambhir as criticism mounts,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/india-vs-south-africa/emotions-run-high-2011-world-cup-winners-blunt-reminder-to-gautam-gambhir-as-criticism-mounts/articleshow/125707616.cms,"India's head coach Gautam Gambhir during a training session (PTI Photo/Kamal Kishore)

Still have doubts? Virat Kohli blows World Cup trumpet with another masterclass

India may have drawn first blood in the Ranchi ODI against South Africa, but head coach Gautam Gambhir continues to remain under a cloud of criticism following the recent Test series debacle. India were blanked 2-0 by the Proteas, adding to an already tense atmosphere around Gambhir’s leadership. Since taking charge, he has overseen two home Test series defeats, first against New Zealand and now against South Africa, prompting fans to vent their frustration at the former opener.The anger reached a flashpoint after the crushing 408-run defeat in Guwahati, where sections of the crowd began chanting ‘Gambhir Aye Haye’. The situation escalated so rapidly that batting coach Sitanshu Kotak and fast bowler Mohammed Siraj had to step in to pacify the spectators. Adding fuel to the fire, fans continue to debate Gambhir’s equations with Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma , and many have even begun speculating about the ODI futures of both senior players.Amid this growing unrest, former India fast bowler Zaheer Khan , who shared the 2011 World Cup dressing room with Gambhir, urged the coach to toughen up and face the criticism calmly.“Emotions run high. When you’ve been winning consistently, expectations rise. Accountability will always follow,” Zaheer told Cricbuzz. He added that the role naturally invites scrutiny and that Gambhir must learn to remain balanced and handle public backlash with resilience.“You’ve got to be thick-skinned to deal with these kinds of criticism. It comes with the passion and expectations surrounding the team,” he said.India’s recent form under Gambhir has not helped his cause. The team lost an ODI series to Sri Lanka last year, followed by a surprise whitewash in New Zealand. Overall, India have lost five of their last seven Tests with Gambhir at the helm.Zaheer further stressed that Gambhir must be more open about his vision, saying that supporters appreciate honesty and clarity regarding selection choices and long-term plans.Gambhir has been criticised for fielding too many all-rounders in the Test XI at the cost of specialists. He also drew sharp reactions for preparing a rank turner in Kolkata against South Africa, despite India previously suffering a 0-3 defeat on similar surfaces in New Zealand.Zaheer suggested that communication is key. “Disappointment comes because everyone knows the team can perform better. It’s a phase, and emotions naturally rise. That’s why the team management needs to engage with fans openly. They understand more than people think,” he said.He concluded by saying that as long as the team sticks to a process aimed at sustainable success, transparency will help ease frustration among supporters. “If the team is clearer and more vocal about its thought process, the fans will understand where they’re coming from. It’s important not to get carried away,” Zaheer added.",Gautam Gambhir has been criticised for fielding too many all-rounders in the Test XI at the cost of specialists.

Why Indian cricket needs Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli... more than ever

Ash Ki Baat

The story of Abhimanyu Easwaran remains one of Indian cricket ’s lingering puzzles. A proven performer in domestic red-ball cricket, the Bengal opener has stacked up runs year after year in the Ranji Trophy , yet a Test debut continues to elude him. Despite being drafted into India’s squad multiple times, he has been repeatedly overlooked whenever an opportunity arises. Over 109 first-class games, Easwaran has compiled 8136 runs at an impressive average of 47.85, but that has still not translated into a place in the playing XI.Now 30, Easwaran has never featured in the Indian Premier League and hasn’t built a big reputation in limited-overs formats. Many believe this lack of white-ball exposure has worked against him, especially at a time when selectors seem to favour shorter-format performers even for Test cricket.However, Easwaran appears determined to change perceptions. In the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy clash against Punjab, he blasted 130 off just 66 balls. Though Bengal couldn’t secure victory, the innings certainly drew attention, marking a rare display of T20 aggression from a player known for red-ball consistency.This knock was even referenced by former India off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin , who took a sly jab at head coach Gautam Gambhir and chief selector Ajit Agarkar during a recent conversation. Ashwin quipped that now that Easwaran has a T20 ton to his name, he will finally be considered for the Test side. “Abhimanyu Easwaran scored a hundred in T20 also now. Now we can get to see him for sure now. Given that he has now scored runs in T20, for sure we will get to see him in the Test team now,” Ashwin remarked on his YouTube channelOne critique Easwaran often faces is that he hasn’t fully capitalised on his chances in India A matches. Earlier this year, he acknowledged the disappointment openly. Speaking to Revsportz in October, he admitted that constantly missing out does affect him. “Yes, it does hurt sometimes. You put in all the effort, train hard, and the dream is to be in the middle, to perform, to contribute to wins. But I’m fortunate to have a solid support system. My family, friends, and coach help me stay grounded and motivated. Right now, I’m in a good headspace and looking forward to the Ranji season,” he said.","Abhimanyu Easwaran is a proven performer in domestic red-ball cricket.

Sitanshu Kotak press conference: Big statement on Virat Kohli, India win and more

Poll What do you think is Virat Kohli's greatest strength as a player? Aggressive batting style Mental preparation Physical fitness Ability to read pitches

KOLKATA: Despite all his onfield aggression, Virat Kohli is like that good boy in class who comes early, always sits on the front bench and completes his studies well in advance before writing the exam. So, he came to Ranchi two days ahead of others, had three good net sessions, and skipped the last day’s practice only when he was fully satisfied with his preparation for the first international game after more than a month.Playing only a format that is fighting for relevance amid a growing number of T20Is and the classic form of the game – Tests, a format he bid goodbye to in May — comes with its own set of challenges. But the man with the most centuries in a single format knows how to stay on top of the game and not just be relevant. With 52 ODI tons, Kohli surpassed Little Master Sachin Tendulkar ’s 51 in Tests in Ranchi on Sunday.“I’ve said it before, if I’m arriving somewhere, I’ll arrive at 120%,” Kohli said at the post-match presentation ceremony after receiving his 44th Player-of-the-Match award in One-Day Internationals.“I came here early because I wanted to get a hold of the conditions a little bit, bat a couple of sessions in the day and one in the evening, so my preparation work was done. I took a day off before the game because I’m 37, I also need to look after recovery.I visualise the game a lot in my mind, and if I see myself being as intense, as sharp, taking the fielders and bowlers on, then I know I’m in a good space and I kind of relax,” he added.Kohli’s innings in the first ODI against India was contrasting in parts. While he took 48 balls to reach his 50 with a six over wide of long on, he needed 54 balls to get to his hundred and then shifted gears to score the last 32 runs from 18 balls before walking back in front of a houseful crowd that gave him a standing ovation.“The pitch played quite decently in the first 20-25 overs before it started to slow down. I just felt let me just go out there and just hit the ball, not think too much about any of the other stuff. It’s just me and the ball coming at me and just enjoying the game, which was the very reason I started playing. When you get a start, the experience kicks in, and you are able to build an innings,” he told the broadcaster.“If you play 300-odd ODIs and so much cricket over the last 15-16 years, if you are in touch with the game and you know that when you are hitting balls at practice, your reflexes are there, your physical ability is there to bat long, if you can bat an hour and a half to two hours at the nets without taking a break, you are kind of meeting all those markers.“I understand if there’s a dip in form, you look for games and you try to get that form back,” felt the ODI great, who now has a staggering 83 international tons.With some talks doing the rounds that BCCI wants seniors to play the domestic 50-over meet for Vijay Hazare Trophy to stay match-ready for the ODIs, Kohli’s remarks might have suggested otherwise. “I have never been a big believer in a lot of preparation. All my cricket has been mental. I work physically very hard every day of my life, it has got nothing to do with cricket anymore, it’s just the way I live. So as long as my fitness levels are up and my enjoyment and mental sharpness are there, then you know it’s fine,” he signed off, giving enough reasons to read between the lines.","Kohli came to Ranchi two days ahead of others and had three good net sessions.

Virat Kohli, Rohit Sharma, other members of Team India leave from Ranchi after the first ODI

India's captain Rohit Sharma surpassed Pakistan's Shahid Afridi's record of 351 ODI sixes during the first ODI against South Africa at JSCA Stadium in Ranchi, hitting his 352nd six. Veteran Indian spinner Ravichandran Ashwin praised Sharma's transformation into a prolific six-hitter and credited India's aggressive batting approach to both Sharma and former head coach Rahul Dravid Sharma achieved this milestone while scoring 57 runs off 51 balls, including five fours and three sixes, marking his 60th ODI fifty in the process. His innings came to an end in the 22nd over when he was dismissed by Jansen.The match saw India secure a 17-run victory over South Africa, taking a 1-0 lead in the three-match ODI series. Sharma and Virat Kohli formed a crucial 136-run partnership for the second wicket, with Kohli going on to score his 52nd ODI century.""I think what we've seen is Rohit Sharma, both as a captain and as a transformed player. If we look at his early career statistically, in his first 30-40 ODIs, he wasn't the six-hitting powerhouse we know today. Now, to see him surpass Shahid Afridi with over 350 sixes is no small feat. Afridi was the original hitting machine for Pakistan in the white-ball game, and Rohit has overtaken that benchmark. How did he do it? In his first 40 ODIs or so, he didn't hit many sixes.But after his double century against Australia in 2013-14, his balls-per-six ratio was 27,"" Ashwin commented.""Since becoming the white-ball captain, that ratio has dropped to 17--an incredible transformation. This is also a perfect example of how Rohit stamps his authority as a captain. He sets the tone by showing exactly what he wants from the team. The rapid evolution of India's batting in T20S and ODIs owes a lot to both Rohit and Rahul bhai (Rahul Dravid). Rahul bhai laid down the principles, and Rohit led by example, paving the way. Over time, this approach has completely transformed the way India approaches batting,"" Ashwin added on his YouTube Channel Ash ki Baat.The match in Ranchi showcased the continued success of the 'Ro-Ko' partnership, referring to Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli, as they dominated the South African bowling attack.Rohit's achievement is particularly notable as Afridi had held the record for most ODI sixes since 2015. Sharma's journey from a player who rarely hit sixes in his early career to becoming the leading six-hitter in ODI cricket demonstrates his remarkable evolution as a batsman.",Rohit Sharma surpasses Shahid Afridi's record of 351 ODI sixes.

Why Indian cricket needs Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli... more than ever

Poll Do you agree with Sunil Gavaskar's view that playing on turning pitches requires more skill than playing on fast, bouncy pitches? Yes, I completely agree No, I believe pace bowling is more challenging

NEW DELHI: Batting great Sunil Gavaskar has ignited one of game's oldest debates with a forceful argument that flips the global batting skill hierarchy on its head. In his latest Sportstar column, the former India captain not only defends turning pitches in the subcontinent but also questions why surfaces that endanger batters with steep bounce continue to be glorified internationally — a point sharpened by the Perth Ashes Test receiving a “very good” rating despite finishing inside two days.The match, which saw 19 wickets fall on Day 1 and ended in just 48 hours, was still rated at the highest level of the ICC's pitch assessment scale. Gavaskar called the rating unsurprising, noting that match referee Ranjan Madugalle is “fair, firm and respected across teams,” adding that few would challenge his verdict. But he pointed to the lone dissenting voice: Australia opener Usman Khawaja , who described the pitch as a “piece of s**t.”Khawaja's criticism — rooted in uneven bounce that even struck Steve Smith on the back elbow — highlighted concerns Gavaskar believes would trigger outrage if they occurred on a turning track in Asia. “Their narrative that a pitch with bounce and danger to life and limb is never bad, but a pitch where the ball turns and keeps low is a disgrace, is sadly still believed even by the complexed ones in the sub-continent,” he wrote, accusing cricket's power centres of longstanding bias.Gavaskar used the moment to reiterate a central thesis: playing high-quality spin requires superior skill. “To counter spin, it is not just about playing forward or back, but also about going down the pitch to smother the turn. That's where skill comes in,” he argued. Advancing to fast bowlers, in contrast, is “more a desperate, premeditated measure… more luck than skill.”The strongest line is Gavaskar's final word on greatness.“So, for me, playing on a turning pitch requires more talent and footwork than playing pace. That is why, if you don't score runs on such surfaces, you are not a great batter.”The second Ashes Test is starting December 4 in Brisbane, which will be a day-night pink-ball contest.","Sunil Gavaskar says playing on turning pitches requires more skill than playing on fast, bouncy pitches.

Jemimah Rodrigues after India reach Women's World Cup final: 'Was going through a lot of anxiety'

Indian cricketer Jemimah Rodrigues recently shared her experience of dealing with overwhelming attention during the Women's World Cup . She had to take the drastic step of uninstalling WhatsApp following her match-winning performance in the semi-final.The India batter revealed she received messages from approximately a thousand unknown numbers after her crucial semi-final innings. This flood of communication made it difficult for her to maintain focus during the tournament.The situation became particularly challenging as she was already processing the emotional impact of the semi-final victory while preparing for the upcoming World Cup final.""I don't know how random people started getting my number. I'm not even over-exaggerating, but I had 1000 WhatsApp messages. I couldn't take it because firstly, a lot had happened in that game. A lot of my emotions itself were there. I'm preparing for a final and the tournament is not over. Yes, I played a knock. Yes, we won. Yes, India was in the final. But, we still had a World Cup final to win,"" she told Cricbuzz in an interview.To manage the situation, Rodrigues decided to completely remove WhatsApp from her phone.Before doing so, she informed only a select group of close contacts about alternative ways to reach her.""Even if I was not reading the message, it was just buzzing. And I just knew that people were messaging me and I just wanted to prepare for the finals. So, till the finals, I didn't install WhatsApp,"" she added.During this period, she maintained minimal social media presence, limiting herself to just one post-match update. She remained disconnected until the World Cup final concluded.After the tournament ended, Rodrigues returned to her social media accounts. She found her feed dominated by content about her semi-final performance and India's achievement in the World Cup.""I've never seen such a sight, even till now, just randomly scrolling Instagram and suddenly my video or something comes up. Or someone is talking about me,"" she further noted.","Jemimah Rodrigues received 1,000 WhatsApp messages after her semi-final innings.

Still have doubts? Virat Kohli blows World Cup trumpet with another masterclass

NEW DELHI: Ravichandran Ashwin has said India’s aggressive batting style in recent years is the result of former captain Rohit Sharma and ex-head coach Rahul Dravid ’s influence.The former India off-spinner said the two pushed for a faster scoring approach in limited-overs cricket and also followed the same approach themselves, which helped change the team’s mindset in T20Is and ODIs.""Rohit as a captain has always been laying his stamp by showing the team what he wants from it. The transitional batting that India has gone through in T20 cricket and ODI cricket -- the way we bat fast -- a lot of credit for that goes to Rohit and Rahul bhai,"" Ashwin said on his YouTube channel 'Ash Ki Baat.'""They showed the way, Rahul bhai said this is how we have to play and Rohit showed the way, paved the way and eventually it has changed the way how India perceived batting. Batting is not average, it is purely strike rate in white ball cricket,"" he added.According to Ashwin, India shifted to a more proactive plan under Rohit and Dravid after a run of disappointing ICC results. The approach was visible during the 2023 ODI World Cup in India, where the team led the league stage with an attacking method, and again during the 2024 T20 World Cup title win in the Caribbean and USA.With Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli now playing only ODI cricket after retiring from T20Is and Tests, Ashwin said fans should value the period left with them in international cricket.""I will say one thing, how much time we have to watch and enjoy Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma bat, please let’s do it because once they are done, we could hear talks like ‘oh, what a player he was! Please bring him back’. That doesn’t cut ice for me.""""For however long they play, let us celebrate them as long as they are playing. As I said, life moves on very fast. Time does not wait for anyone. It is very important that we realise that the time is less. So it is better that we enjoy whatever they are doing,"" he said.",Ravichandran Ashwin credits Rohit Sharma and Rahul Dravid for India's aggressive batting style.

Desert Vipers captain Lockie Ferguson feels the mushrooming T20 leagues around the world are not a big threat to international cricket. The New Zealand speedster said the increase in the number of T20 leagues is great for the sport. The fourth season of the ILT20 begins on Tuesday with a rematch of last season's final between defending champions Dubai Capitals and Desert Vipers.""I think they can coexist for sure,"" Ferguson told reporters on eve of the fourth season of the ILT20.""What's great about these franchise tournaments—this one in particular—is I remember being on a journey myself, working with the Blackcaps senior bowlers, and you learn so much so quickly. I can imagine local young players coming into these groups and learning from the guys who are on the big stage. Their development will be so quick.""From the franchise point of view, it's great. Obviously, international cricket has been working in and around it. I know the players are passionate about playing for their country. It's a different style of play that they adopt.

AHMEDABAD: Even as their seniors have struggled for success of late, the country’s U-17 boys wrote a famous chapter, sealing qualification for the AFC U-17 Asian Cup in Saudi Arabia. The grade came on the dint of inflicting a 2-1 defeat to an old rival, Iran, by defending resolutely and keeping the aggressive visitors at bay for more than 40 minutes to edge the Asian giants in the last of the qualifiers here.Seven minutes into the second half with the game tied 1-1, defender Korou Konthoujam launched a high ball into the opposite half. Iranian defender Amirmahan Afrooziani’s attempt to connect with it failed, and as he fell down, India midfielder Gunleiba Wangkheirakpam, lurking on the left flank, took two touches before unleashing a fierce shot that took the deflection of Mohammad Ali Rahnama before landing in the Iranian goal. The goal sparked wild, delirious celebrations on the Indian bench, and Gunleiba was cautioned for his shirtless celebration.India still needed to keep Iran at bay for more than 40 minutes, and they defended with composure and rare resoluteness. Every ball launched into the Indian box was cleared first time.","India beat Iran 2-1 to qualify for AFC U-17 Asian Cup in Saudi Arabia.

Alexander Isak scored his first Premier League goal for Liverpool, leading to a crucial 2-0 victory against West Ham at the London Stadium on Sunday.The Sweden forward had not scored in five Premier League appearances since his British record £125 million transfer from Newcastle in September.This was only Isak's second goal in 11 matches across all competitions for Liverpool, following his initial score in a League Cup victory against Southampton.Liverpool secured their first win in four games when Cody Gakpo added a second goal during stoppage time.""There's definitely a feeling of relief because if you have lost so many times, then winning is important. We hardly conceded a chance and we were able to create chances ourselves,"" Reds boss Arne Slot said.""It helps if you don't go 1-0 down after five minutes because then you are more open. We played the game I wanted us to play. What I saw meant a lot to our players and our fans. This is a good first step for us. We won and had a clean sheet.""Isak's performance had been affected by injuries and lack of match fitness after missing pre-season due to his extended transfer negotiations.The 26-year-old's goal marked his first league score since playing for Newcastle against Brighton in May, ending a 10-match goalless streak for both club and country.""I think it does feel significant,"" Slot said.Liverpool had faced recent challenges, including a 4-1 defeat against PSV Eindhoven in the Champions League and 3-0 losses to Manchester City and Nottingham Forest.The team had lost nine of their previous 12 games, marking their worst performance since 1953-54, including six defeats in seven league matches.The victory helped Liverpool move to eighth place, providing relief for Slot who faced mounting pressure.Mohamed Salah's performance has been a concern, with only five goals this season, leading to his third bench placement.West Ham honored their former captain and manager Billy Bonds, who passed away at 79, with a minute's applause.Despite West Ham's strong start, Liverpool gradually took control of the match.Isak initially struggled, missing a clear chance from the edge of the area and having a bicycle kick saved by Alphonse Areola.The Swedish striker finally scored after 60 minutes, converting Gakpo's assist with a low shot past Areola.Isak was substituted shortly after scoring, receiving acknowledgment from Slot on the sideline.West Ham's situation worsened when Lucas Paqueta received a red card in the 84th minute for two yellow cards, both for dissent against referee Darren England.The match concluded with Gakpo scoring from 12 yards following a defensive error by West Ham.","Liverpool defeated West Ham 2-0 at the London Stadium on Sunday.

Joshua Zirkzee scored his first Premier League goal in nearly a year, while Mason Mount secured the winning goal as Manchester United defeated Crystal Palace 2-1 on Sunday.Ruben Amorim's team initially fell behind when Jean-Philippe Mateta scored a first-half penalty at Selhurst Park. However, Zirkzee and Mount's second-half goals helped United secure their first victory in four matches.United overcame their slow start with Zirkzee's first Premier League goal since his strike against Everton in December 2024. The Dutch striker had experienced a 24-game goalless streak in the league, raising questions about his £36 million transfer from Bologna in 2024.Zirkzee, aged 24, had not found the net in his previous eight appearances since April. Mount, who has faced injury setbacks since joining from Chelsea, celebrated only his second goal of the season.This victory marked United's first win since October, providing relief for Amorim after their recent loss to 10-man Everton at Old Trafford. The win was particularly significant as it ended Palace's unbeaten home record in the Premier League, which had stood since February 15.""There are no excuses"" for United's struggling start to the season, Amorim had stated earlier in the week.Casemiro nearly gave United an early lead within the first minute when a long throw created confusion in Palace's defense, but Dean Henderson saved his close-range shot.Mateta missed an opportunity at the other end, failing to score after getting past Leny Yoro with only goalkeeper Senne Lammens to beat. Lammens then made saves from Daichi Kamada's low shot and helped defend against Yeremy Pino's attempt.Palace took the lead in the 36th minute through a penalty. Yoro fouled Mateta, who initially scored but had his goal disallowed for a double-touch violation.A new rule implemented this season allows successful penalties with accidental double-touches to be retaken. This rule clarification followed Julian Alvarez's disallowed penalty for Atletico Madrid against Real Madrid last season.Mateta successfully converted his second attempt past Lammens. Zirkzee, who had been quiet in the first half, equalized in the 54th minute with a remarkable shot from a difficult angle after receiving Bruno Fernandes' free-kick.Shortly after scoring, Zirkzee almost contributed to an own goal when he deflected the ball toward his own net, but it was cleared to safety.Mount put United ahead in the 63rd minute, scoring from a free-kick assist by Fernandes. His low shot went under the Palace wall and past Henderson from 20 yards out.",Manchester United defeated Crystal Palace 2-1 at Selhurst Park.

Inter Miami head coach Javier Mascherano showered praise on Lionel Messi , calling him “extraordinary”, after the Argentine icon guided the club into their maiden MLS Cup final with a commanding 5-1 victory over New York City FC on Saturday.Miami’s charge to the championship match was led by a brilliant Tadeo Allende hat-trick, while Mateo Silvetti and Telasco Segovia also found the net in a dominant performance at Fort Lauderdale.Messi, 38, didn’t score on the night, but produced a moment of pure class when he set up Silvetti for Miami’s third goal. That assist came just as New York were closing in on an equaliser and effectively put the contest to bed.Mascherano, who previously shared the pitch with Messi for Barcelona and Argentina, said his star man continues to redefine what is possible.“Leo has spoiled us with the extraordinary,” Mascherano said. “He is unique, someone we won’t see again. Maybe people expected a goal today, but he brought calmness with that third goal. Only he can spot that pass. It basically ended the match.”Miami will now welcome either San Diego FC or the Vancouver Whitecaps, who face off later on Saturday, in next weekend’s MLS Cup final.The team enters the title clash in peak form, having smashed FC Cincinnati 4-0 in the previous round and now dismantling New York with similar ruthlessness.Allende was at the centre of Miami’s attacking storm once again. The 26-year-old struck first in the 14th minute after beating the offside trap, then doubled the lead with an outstanding header shortly after.New York responded through Justin Haak’s headed effort in the 37th minute and almost levelled when Julian Fernandez drew a superb save from Rocco Rios Novo in the 66th minute.That moment proved pivotal. Miami instantly countered, with Rodrigo De Paul and Jordi Alba combining before Messi threaded a perfectly weighted pass to Silvetti, who fired home for 3-1.Segovia made it 4-1 in the 83rd minute, and Allende completed his hat-trick a minute later, setting off huge celebrations.Mascherano credited the squad for turning around a season that once looked in disarray.“The players deserve the praise. They understood the direction we needed to take,” he said. “We grew stronger together and reached this stage with a real sense of unity.

The young prodigy from South London, who previously played for Dynamo Youth FC, has made the significant move to Finch Farm Academy in Liverpool in 2025.The Premier League India's X and Instagram brought attention to Urban's signing by sharing photos of him with an Everton jersey and an Indian flag at Everton's new Hill Dickinson Stadium.

Why did the Giants bench Abdul Carter again? The rookie’s repeated tardiness and team-rule violations raise fresh concerns,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/why-did-the-giants-bench-abdul-carter-again-the-rookies-repeated-tardiness-and-team-rule-violations-raise-fresh-concerns/articleshow/125708477.cms,"(Image Source - Getty Images)

Why was Abdul Carter benched?

When Abdul Carter opened the game on the bench, it immediately raised eyebrows because it fit a pattern many inside the New York Giants building have been talking about. Carter already had a similar moment two weeks earlier when he sat out the first series against the Green Bay Packers after missing a walk-through that insiders described as part of a rookie year trend. At the time, he told ESPN it was an honest mistake and blamed a treatment schedule mix up, brushing aside talk of oversleeping.Still, that incident happened under the shadow of a 1 9 start that cost Brian Daboll his job, and several players privately shared that discipline had slipped throughout the season. Once Mike Kafka stepped in as interim head coach in November, things shifted quickly. So when ESPN reported that Carter’s latest absence was simply a coach’s decision, it matched Kafka’s early push to tighten up expectations. Reports cited by CBS Sports noted that Carter had missed all or part of another team responsibility before kickoff. With the Giants stuck in a six game skid and riding a 12 game road losing streak, it feels like Kafka is trying to reset the entire culture. Carter’s benching was just the most visible sign.ESPN sideline reporter shared the details during the broadcast, stating that sources had informed her the absence was classified as a ""coach's decision"" and not related to any injury.Interim head coach Mike Kafka later confirmed the disciplinary nature of the move but kept specifics internal, telling reporters postgame, ""It's a coach's decision,"" without elaborating further on the infraction.Reports from The New York Post, cited by CBS Sports, indicated that Carter had missed all or part of another team responsibility leading into the game, echoing the reason for his prior benching.This came amid a broader team context: The Giants entered the matchup on a six-game losing streak, including 12 straight road defeats dating back to the previous season, and Kafka, hired last month after the firing of head coach Brian Daboll, has emphasized accountability as a core principle in his early tenure. Several Giants players have noted to ESPN that lapses in discipline contributed to the team's 2-9 record through 12 games.Also Read: Quinshon Judkins injury update: Cleveland Browns’ star slams his head forcing an exit",Abdul Carter was benched for the first series of the New York Giants game against the Green Bay Packers.

Cardi B and Stefon Diggs net worth comparison





New England’s Stefon Diggs is known for his stardom on the football field, as he has been one of the most productive wide receivers in the NFL for the last decade, but lately, his life off the gridiron has stirred just as much attention. The Patriots wideout is now dating superstar rapper Cardi B , and the two recently welcomed their first baby. Fans are fascinated by the pairing, not only for their celebrity status but also for the question everyone asks. Which half of the couple has the higher net worth?Patriots' Stefon Diggs just kicked off his 11th NFL season, and his first with the New England Patriots, after signing a three-year, $63.5 million contract this offseason. He has long been among the league’s elite wide receivers, with a career defined by consistent performance, steady leadership, and major paydays. In total, Diggs has made $155.8 million in career earnings. According to Celebrity Net Worth, his net worth is listed at $60 million, a massive number. But does it rival his girlfriend’s?Cardi B began her rise in the early 2010s, using social media as her launchpad before stepping into Love and Hip Hop: New York in 2015.That exposure helped shape her brand, but it was music that sent her into global recognition. They signed with Atlantic Records in 2017 and released “Bodak Yellow”, which became her defining breakthrough. The track hit number one on the Billboard Hot 100 and shifted her from rising artist to mainstream star. She has only grown since then, earning 10 Grammy nominations and winning one for Best Rap Album in 2019 for her album, “Invasion of Privacy.” According to Celebrity Net Worth, her net worth is listed at $80 million, beating out her boyfriend by $20 million.The numbers reveal a striking contrast in how each built their fortune. Diggs relies mainly on his NFL contracts, bonuses, and performance incentives. Cardi B has multiple revenue streams. Her music, brand partnerships, touring potential, digital presence, and entrepreneurial endeavors allow her wealth to expand beyond any single category. While Cardi B has a roughly $20 million net worth lead, both stand among the rare personalities whose achievements transcend their industries. Together, the power couple share an impressive combined net worth of around $140 million. Whether by sharp lyricism or precise route running, both continue to shape culture, success, and influence in their own style.Also Read: ""He was going to kill me"": Titans’ Julius Chestnut drops bombshell accusation that Jaguars punter Cooke threatened to kill him during intense Sunday clash","Cardi B and Stefon Diggs have a combined net worth of around $140 million.

Tennessee Titans running back Julius Chestnut and the Cooke confrontation



Tennessee Titans running back Julius Chestnut was taken off guard by Jacksonville Jaguars punter Logan Cooke’s intense and emotional threat during Sunday’s matchup. The moment followed a bruising hit that briefly sidelined Cooke for a concussion evaluation, setting off a spark of volatile tensions. What unfolded next was not the usual trash talk. As Chestnut recalled to reporters, Cooke got close and, in his words, “said he was going to kill” him. The young Titans back shared it with a half-smile, still visibly perplexed by what he had heard. “I was just trying to play hard, and he came up to me and said he was going to kill me,” Chestnut said. “So I don’t know what made him do that.”The unexpected hostility was even stranger given that such outbursts from a punter are virtually unheard of. Chestnut added, “That was surprising to me. I ain't never seen nothing like that before.” He said he did not receive any follow-up clarification or apology from Cooke after the incident.This was not an isolated flare-up, but one scene in a broader storm between both teams. Cooke, who stands 6 feet 5 and weighs 230 pounds, is not a passive specialist. He absorbed multiple collisions during Jacksonville’s 25-3 win, including the block from Chestnut on Chimere Dike’s 47-yard return.That block sent Cooke to the turf, where he remained for concussion evaluation before returning and continuing to punt through visible frustrations.Cooke did speak after the game, but reporters never directly asked him about the alleged death threat. He instead addressed his heated interactions with Titans players and a discussion with a referee at halftime. ""I might have said some things that sounded rude, so I wanted to go clear the air,"" Cooke said. He explained that he wanted no grudges left hanging and added that emotions can escalate quickly “in the moment” during certain calls. “But it is what it is,” Cooke said. “You can’t hold that against them.”Jaguars coach Liam Coen acknowledged the emotional undercurrent that fueled Cooke’s reactions, citing the pressure of aggressive punt rushes and the challenges of working with a backup long snapper. “There were some frustrations being built up with them rushing us the way they were,” Coen said. “I’m proud of those guys for competing, but we’ve got to continue to be smarter.”In the end, the scoreboard showed a decisive Jaguars victory. The emotional fallout told a much more revealing story of rivalry, adrenaline, and human unpredictability on the field.Also Read: While Drake Maye prepares for Giants, his wife Ann’s Patriots-themed cookies become unexpected pre-game sensation","Tennessee Titans running back Julius Chestnut reveals he was threatened with death on the field by Jaguars punter Logan Cooke.

Is Charlie Puth replacing Bad Bunny at Super Bowl LX? Rumored shake-up at the Halftime Show sparks confusion,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/is-charlie-puth-replacing-bad-bunny-at-super-bowl-lx-rumored-shake-up-at-the-halftime-show-sparks-confusion/articleshow/125706683.cms,"Fan speculation about Super Bowl LX's musical lineup, fueled by Charlie Puth's anthem announcement, mistakenly suggested Bad Bunny was replaced. However, the NFL is expanding its pregame entertainment, not altering the halftime headliner. Bad Bunny remains the intentional halftime performer, with Puth, Coco Jones, and Brandi Carlile adding to a diversified cultural showcase.

Bad Bunny remains the headliner as the NFL expands the overall musical experience

The road to Super Bowl LX has become unexpectedly dramatic, not because of football, but because of fan speculation. When Charlie Puth posted his excited message on X, “I can’t believe I’m saying this… I will be performing the National Anthem at Super Bowl LX”, many casual followers mistakenly interpreted it as him stepping into a larger role.That misunderstanding quickly snowballed into rumors that Bad Bunny had been pulled from the halftime broadcast or replaced entirely. The misunderstanding grew in part because the pregame lineup features high-profile artists, and the recent addition of Coco Jones and Brandi Carlile only amplified chatter. But beneath the noise, the NFL ’s original halftime headliner decision hasn’t changed.What’s really happening is not a shake-up, it’s an expansion. The NFL is clearly moving toward a more diversified entertainment slate, turning the Super Bowl into a layered concert-style broadcast before a single snap of the ball.Puth will headline the national anthem, Jones will deliver “Lift Every Voice and Sing,” and Carlile will perform “America the Beautiful,” while ASL sign artists Fred Beam and Julian Ortiz ensure inclusive representation. This wide music spectrum builds anticipation differently than in previous years, carving out a full-day cultural showcase rather than a singular halftime spectacle.Meanwhile, Bad Bunny’s halftime role is untouched and it’s intentional. The NFL knows he brings both global reach and passionate fandom, especially among younger audiences and Latino viewers. Even earlier backlash from certain political pundits following his September announcement did not shift the league’s direction. If anything, the rumors unintentionally spotlighted the growing cultural footprint of the halftime show and Bad Bunny’s central place in it.Super Bowl LX at Levi’s Stadium is shaping up to be less about substitution and more about celebration. Puth isn’t replacing Bad Bunny, he’s complementing him. The overall approach suggests this year’s production wants to appeal simultaneously to pop fans, R&B listeners, Americana audiences, and a cross-national demographic that extends past traditional NFL spectators.Instead of one defining performance, viewers will be treated to a full spectrum of sounds, culminating with Bad Bunny still owning the halftime stage.Also Read: Taylor Swift’s Eras docuseries faces fan backlash as Travis Kelce’s presence takes center stage","Fan speculation about Super Bowl LX's musical lineup, fueled by Charlie Puth's anthem announcement, mistakenly suggested Bad Bunny was replaced.

At the same time, she has built a vibrant TikTok community, earning 1.9 million likes with her cooking and game-day content.After rocking some game-day holiday pajamas, Ann did another video where she was making some Patriots-themed game-day cookies. She finished off her “Bakemas” Patriots M&M chocolate chip cookies and they look scrumptious. Some viewers even joked that the cookie colors looked like Giants colors. Just saying.The couple’s connection runs deep. Drake was a superstar for UNC before he became the No. 3 overall pick in the 2024 NFL Draft to New England. Ann Michael also went to college with Maye, and her brother Tad even played QB with Maye. They got married just this past June 21 back in North Carolina.The relationship between the rising NFL star and his supportive wife adds a grounded layer to the Patriots narrative. She has called Thanksgiving her “Super Bowl” on TikTok, and her festive spirit goes hand in hand with images of holiday beverages, decorated house visuals, and spirited gear.Tonight, in a stadium pulsing with pressure and hope, Drake Maye will be thinking about first downs and end zones.

Rapunzel casting drama grows while Taylor Swift is eyed for a Disney role amid her upcoming wedding with Travis Kelce,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/rapunzel-casting-drama-grows-while-taylor-swift-is-eyed-for-a-disney-role-amid-her-upcoming-wedding-with-travis-kelce/articleshow/125706667.cms,"Disney's live-action Rapunzel search has sparked intense fan debate, with rumors swirling about Taylor Swift potentially playing a princess, even Elsa in a Frozen adaptation. This speculation highlights a potential shift in Disney's remake strategy, balancing age-appropriateness with celebrity power, as Scarlett Johansson is also rumored for Mother Gothel. The public's strong feelings about Disney royalty are evident.

Taylor Swift speculation and Disney’s casting future expands beyond Tangled

Disney’s search for its live-action Rapunzel has unexpectedly evolved into one of entertainment’s most spirited casting discussions, igniting everything from fan-dreamed wishlists to full-blown cultural commentary. While the studio continues testing potential Rapunzel candidates for at least two more weeks, the attention has shifted beyond Tangled, landing squarely on rumors that Disney may have its eyes on Taylor Swift for a princess role in an upcoming project.The mere suggestion of Swift entering the Disney royal ranks has split fans into fascination, skepticism, sarcasm, and online outbursts that range from playful jabs to heated debate over age, identity, and Hollywood casting norms. Meanwhile, the speculation itself may be telling us something larger about Disney’s evolving strategy for live-action remakes.According to the insider discussion circulating online, Disney’s leadership is reportedly interested in placing Swift as a princess, potentially even Elsa if a Frozen adaptation moves forward. The fan reactions are everything but calm. Some instantly rejected the idea, saying “No 35 year old is being cast as a Disney princess,” while others argued that her star power could create a different kind of appeal.Interestingly, Disney’s hesitation over Ariana Grande, reportedly passing on her because she was “too old”, suggests the studio remains rigid about age-matching animated characters. Yet, the broader question is whether Disney is still trying to recreate animated youth with live-action actors, or if it’s beginning to lean into recognizable celebrity casting to revive trust in the remake strategy.The rumor mill also points to Scarlett Johansson circling the role of Mother Gothel, with Johansson herself choosing her words carefully when asked, calling director Michael Gracey “absolutely an extraordinary visionary.” That measured phrasing suggests negotiations remain sensitive and ongoing.Ultimately, whether Swift ever holds a scepter onscreen or not, this speculation shows how deeply the public feels ownership over Disney royalty. The casting drama has become part of the entertainment itself and Disney, intentionally or not, benefits from every heated comment and every speculative headline.Also Read: Taylor Swift’s Eras docuseries faces fan backlash as Travis Kelce’s presence takes center stage","Taylor Swift speculation and Disney’s casting future expands beyond Tangled.

Eagles loss to Bears puts spotlight on Kevin Patullo



The Eagles lost to the Bears on Friday, 24–15, and the frustration that had been simmering around Philadelphia’s offense spilled into something far more personal. Hours after the defeat, offensive coordinator Kevin Patullo discovered his New Jersey residence had been egged in the early hours of Saturday morning. Police later addressed the incident, confirming that “Kevin Patullo had eggs thrown at his house on Saturday according to local police,” as reported by TheEaglesWire on X, formerly Twitter. It clarified a swirl of social media claims that rocks had been hurled at the home. The investigation is active, but the motive seems painfully obvious.This season, the Eagles have not played like defending champions. With a record recently slipping to 8-4 after an uncompetitive loss to the Chicago Bears, fans have been restless, vocal, and at times irrational. During Friday’s game, the boos rained down stronger than the offense’s failures on the field, and Patullo’s name has become the lightning rod for blame. Philadelphia expected fireworks with Jalen Hurts, Saquon Barkley , A.J. Brown, and DeVonta Smith. Instead, the team has landed in the bottom third of major offensive categories.Patullo was promoted this past offseason to replace Kellen Moore and has since absorbed the brunt of criticism. Some fans see him as the core problem, but the offense’s struggles have deeper layers. Timing issues, route miscommunications, and an inability to adjust mid-game have repeatedly stalled drives. Yet, even with rising tensions, head coach Nick Sirianni stated firmly after Friday’s loss that the organization was standing by its coordinator.He noted there would be no change in play-calling responsibilities.Philadelphia fans have a reputation for emotional extremes. Egging a coach’s house crosses a line into personal attack and shows the volatile mix of passion and impatience that shadows sports culture. Still, the roster holds immense talent. If the dynamic shifts and the right rhythm sparks at the right time, this team remains capable of a resurgence late in the season. The Eagles return to the field for Monday Night Football against the Los Angeles Chargers on December 8, a game that could either calm the chaos or intensify it.Also Read: Shedeur Sanders’ mom shows off proud mama style in unforgettable glam game-day look","Eagles fans reportedly egg Kevin Patullo's home after Bears loss sparks outrage and escalating frustration.

Marissa Phillips reveals the intense work behind the glamour. Rehearsals, performances, and recovery fill their schedules. They juggle day jobs and personal sacrifices. The team's dedication ensures festive traditions for millions of fans. This relentless preparation defines their commitment to America's Team.

How the holiday spotlight comes with unseen pressures and relentless preparation

For many fans, Thanksgiving and the December game stretch represent cozy gatherings, family meals, and televised holiday matchups, but behind the choreographed smiles and sparkling uniforms, the Dallas Cowboys cheerleaders are navigating something far more intense. Marissa Phillips, 25, has become a candid voice for what the public rarely sees: a nonstop work cycle that begins long before turkey hits the table.While fans soak in the glitter and glamour of holiday performances, Phillips and her teammates are juggling grueling schedules, recovery routines, and professional day jobs. Their dedication isn’t just about executing routines, it’s about preserving the magic for millions of viewers while sacrificing personal time, family gatherings, and physical comfort to meet the tradition-driven expectations of America’s Team.Phillips explained that the holiday rush starts well ahead of Thanksgiving, as the squad ramps up rehearsals, game prep, and stage performances at The Star, where each 30-minute show is backed by festive production and heavy choreography.Marissa Phillips admits to People, “We’ve been so busy, and now we’re about to get into our really, really busy season.” That season doesn’t just demand stamina, it demands mental discipline.“It’s just really sweet, because a lot of people will bring their kids and their families and get all dressed up and get hot cocoa,” she said. The team stages the shows with festive lighting, three costume changes, and signature routines like Thunderstruck. Each show runs short, but the work behind it adds up.“If we have a game on Sunday or a game on Thursday for Thanksgiving, that can be really busy,” Phillips said. “We just have to be really prepared and make sure we know all of our parts.” Actually, the dancers lean on muscle memory and stay sharp even when they feel exhausted. “It’s a very, very tiring show and a lot of compartmentalization,” she said. “But you just get into your muscle memory and turn your brain on a little bit and it’s really fun. ”The most striking takeaway isn’t that the job is demanding, it’s that every performance is anchored in joy and connection. Phillips emphasizes the payoff in seeing families gather for shows, kids sipping hot cocoa, and fans celebrating tradition. That audience, she says, is what gives the job meaning, even when November and December feel like a blur of rehearsals, travel, and sacrifice.Also Read: ""Kelce's last season"": Travis Kelce ignites retirement battle with statement performance against","Dallas Cowboys cheerleaders Marissa Phillips reveals the intense work behind the glamour.

Aaron Rodgers latest injury update: Pittsburgh confronts harsh reality after brutal hit leaves QB shaken,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/aaron-rodgers-latest-injury-update-pittsburgh-confronts-harsh-reality-after-brutal-hit-leaves-qb-shaken/articleshow/125693255.cms,"The Pittsburgh Steelers' decision to play Aaron Rodgers with a healing wrist fracture backfired, turning a display of grit into a cause for concern. Despite his desire to return, Rodgers' unstable wrist and the potential for further injury highlight the franchise's risky gamble on toughness over caution, jeopardizing his long-term availability.

Steelers must reconsider physical risk as Aaron Rodgers hopes to return but wrist remains unstable

When the Pittsburgh Steelers trotted Aaron Rodgers onto the field in Buffalo, it felt like an act of defiance, an aging quarterback refusing to surrender to pain, and a franchise convinced that grit could substitute for health. But by the time he walked off with blood on his face and fractures still healing in his wrist, the narrative shifted from courage to concern.Rodgers didn’t look like a quarterback fighting for a playoff push, he looked like a veteran forced into a no-win situation. Pittsburgh gambled on toughness over caution, and now with Rodgers’ own admission,“I’m not ready to take a snap under center yet,” the franchise must confront whether they’ve risked his long-term availability for a short-term hope.Rodgers’ wrist fractures weren’t the cause of the bloodied nose, but they were the hidden time bomb throughout the night. Every snap, every hit, every awkward landing only amplified the question: Should he have been playing at all? Insider reports revealed the breaks included at least one severe fracture, the kind associated with heavy impact. That means even routine contact becomes dangerous for healing.Before the hit from Joey Bosa changed the tone of the night, Pittsburgh led 7–3 and seemed to be controlling tempo.But when Rodgers was swallowed up in the backfield, lost the ball, and came up bleeding, the emotional energy drained out of the team. The rest was a spiral, failed drives, a shaky backup performance, and a run defense gashed for a franchise-worst 249 yards allowed at Acrisure Stadium.The concerning part? Rodgers still wants to rush back. His competitive spirit is admirable, but it’s also exactly why the Steelers’ coaching staff must make the decision for him. Pittsburgh needs a quarterback who can throw pain-free, not one taping bones together and praying through snaps.If the Steelers push him back too early, this season won’t just be bruising, it could become permanently costly.Also Read: Aaron Rodgers’ secret marriage mystery grows louder as even family admits they’ve never met his wife","Pittsburgh Steelers' decision to play Aaron Rodgers with a healing wrist fracture backfired, turning a display of grit into a cause for concern.

How the Raiders’ 2025 collapse turned Tom Brady’s ownership debut into unexpected frustration and fan-blaming chaos,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/how-the-raiders-2025-collapse-turned-tom-bradys-ownership-debut-into-unexpected-frustration-and-fan-blaming-chaos/articleshow/125697552.cms,"Raiders GM John Spytek, and minority owner Tom Brady (Imagn Images)

Tom Brady’s first year with Raiders turns sour as poor performance fuels tension behind closed doors





Tom Brady entered the Raiders organization with a vision shaped by decades of excellence. He wasn’t stepping into ownership to be a quiet observer. He came as someone determined to help build a culture, steer critical decisions and inject accountability into a franchise badly in need of direction. Yet as the season unfolded, the gulf between expectations and reality widened, exposing the brutal complexity of transitioning from legendary player to influential decision-maker.Inside the building, the belief was that Brady’s presence alone would inspire improvement. Instead, the results have fallen short. The optimism that marked his arrival has shifted into self-examination, not only around coaching and personnel, but around decision-making at the highest levels.The intentions from owner Mark Davis were never subtle. “Bringing in Tom Brady was bringing in somebody on the football side that having here in the organization,” Davis said in January. ""[Gruden] was somebody that I brought in and really expected to be that person on the football side that would bring stability to the organization. He had a 10-year contract and all that, and he had his head chopped off.”Davis didn’t stop there. “It took four years to actually get Tom into the building and bring in that expertise and that confidence that we’re talking about.. . . There is a vision, and Tom does have vision. I don’t think there’s anybody more competitive, that I know of, than Tom Brady. . . . Tom was brought in initially for the football side of the building. Somebody who is going to be there for a long, long time. Not as a president, but. ”But the season that followed that vision has been a harsh test. The Raiders have spiraled to a 2-9 record, struggling to find rhythm, consistency or identity. The firing of offensive coordinator Chip Kelly became the most public flashpoint. As Mike Florio reported, “The first scapegoat was offensive coordinator Chip Kelly, who was hired (as many believe) at Brady’s recommendation, if not urging. In the aftermath of the termination of Kelly and his $6 million annual salary, embarrassing details about Kelly’s performance, including the astounding claim that he at times called plays that were neither in the game plan nor the playbook. ""Florio added, ""The clunky effort to justify firing Kelly indirectly splashes mud on Brady’s judgment, if he did indeed target and recommend Kelly. The overall performance of the team casts doubt on the value of leveraging Brady’s immense success as a player into building a properly-functioning football organization.""That tension is mirrored internally. According to Dianna Russini’s reporting, Brady was deeply frustrated with how the offense was being run, starting with Kelly’s direction and extending to broader execution problems. His concerns weren’t limited to scheme, but to structure, discipline and direction.This season has become a revealing study in leadership beyond the field. Brady’s competitive spirit hasn’t faded, but the challenge of reshaping an NFL organization is proving more complicated than assembling a championship drive. What happens next for the Raiders may ultimately define Brady’s second career in football: whether this was a misstep or the painful beginning of something stronger.Also Read: Shedeur Sanders’ mom shows off proud mama style in unforgettable glam game-day look","Tom Brady joined the Oakland Raiders as a minority owner in January.

“Time goes so fast”: Brittany Mahomes’ latest photos trigger emotional reactions across Chiefs Nation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/time-goes-so-fast-brittany-mahomes-latest-photos-trigger-emotional-reactions-across-chiefs-nation/articleshow/125693082.cms,"Brittany Mahomes celebrated her son Bronze's third birthday, a milestone that resonated with NFL fans due to the rapid passage of time. The touching tribute shifted focus from the Chiefs' recent loss and playoff anxieties to the enduring joy of family and growth, reminding everyone of life's most important victories.

How Bronze’s third birthday turned into a nostalgic moment for NFL fans

Brittany Mahomes may often be seen cheering from the sidelines, but this time, it was her voice as a mother, not an NFL wife, that resonated across social media. Just one day after the Kansas City Chiefs’ tough Thanksgiving loss to the Cowboys, she shared a loving birthday tribute to her son, Bronze, who just turned three.For many fans, the photos didn’t just show how cute he is, they highlighted how fast time has flown since the Mahomes family first welcomed him into the world in 2022. In a season where Chiefs devotees are anxious about the team’s playoff fate, Brittany’s post offered something different: a reminder of life, growth, and joy beyond the scoreboard. Patrick Mahomes ’ performance on Thanksgiving was strong, four touchdowns, 261 yards, zero interceptions, but it wasn’t enough to secure the win. Still, Brittany’s post the following day shifted the focus away from football and back to family. Her caption read: “Happy Birthday to my little dude! The smartest yet very wild and hilarious kid you will ever meet! Everyday is a new day of silly jokes and lots and lots of love with you! My baby boy is 3🥹 your sisters, mom and dad love you forever and ever🤍”That affection hit fans hard, not because the words were shocking, but because the little boy they remember seeing as a newborn is suddenly a walking, talking toddler. Comments poured in: “How is he 3 already!!!?? ❤️” … “He was just born!” … and “Time goes so fast!”Bronze has grown up in parallel with Kansas City’s football dynasty. When he arrived, Mahomes already had two Super Bowl rings. Now, Mahomes is gunning for a fourth title while also juggling fatherhood for a family of three.For the Chiefs, the road ahead is tough, their playoff odds dropped to 35%, and every remaining game is crucial. But as Brittany’s post proved, even in the most intense stretch of the NFL calendar, there are moments that remind players and fans alike what actually matters.Whether Kansas City rallies or not, the Mahomes family continues to score where it counts: in love, laughter, and the kind of milestones that matter long after the season ends.Also Read: Brittany Mahomes turns up the heat with Chiefs fashion launch while Kansas City sweats the playoff race",Brittany Mahomes celebrated her son Bronze's third birthday with a touching tribute.

The meaningful name tradition and how both families are embracing this next stage

The dispute, stemming from an alleged confrontation over Lively's discomfort with weight-related questions for the film 'It Ends With Us,' has seen Lively file a lawsuit and Baldoni's countersuit dismissed.

It Ends With Us-interview med Blake Lively og Isabela Ferrer i København

The legal dispute between Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni has shifted from a quiet courtroom matter into a sprawling Hollywood saga, one that now appears to involve iconic A-list observers like Taylor Swift and Hugh Jackman. According to reports, the alleged confrontation between Ryan Reynolds and Baldoni in April 2023 was not a private emotional exchange, but a moment that unfolded in front of unexpected witnesses.Swift’s presence, whether as a friend of Lively, a supportive observer, or an incidental attendee, has become a focal point of speculation. In a cultural moment where celebrity behavior is dissected frame by frame, the question is no longer just what happened, but who saw it, and what that means for the case moving forward.The confrontation reportedly took place inside Reynolds’ New York penthouse, where tensions erupted over Blake Lively’s discomfort regarding alleged fat-shaming questions tied to It Ends With Us. Reynolds’ alleged outburst, “How dare you f***ing ask about my wife’s weight? What’s wrong with you?”, did more than spark a personal defense of Lively. It set off a ripple effect that has now blurred the lines between workplace interactions, personal boundaries, and Hollywood politics.Baldoni, who was allegedly left in tears and embarrassed, later apologized in the moment. But outside that room, the stakes climbed. Lively filed her lawsuit in December 2024, alleging harassment and retaliation on Baldoni’s part. Baldoni’s massive $400 million countersuit was dismissed, signaling a key legal momentum shift toward Lively’s complaint. With trial preparations underway and a March 2026 start date scheduled, every leaked document and every named witness only deepens public fascination.Meanwhile, young It Ends With Us actress Isabela Ferrer unintentionally found herself swept into the narrative. Despite her poised debut, fans observed that Lively often dominated interviews, overshadowing Ferrer’s opportunity to speak. Yet Ferrer herself reportedly texted Baldoni praising his professionalism, complicating the online perception that the case is simply heroes vs. villains.Ultimately, what began as a movie-related dispute has pressed larger issues into the spotlight: how power is used, how women are treated in professional settings, and how celebrity-adjacent narratives can redefine reputations before a judge ever speaks.Also Read: Taylor Swift’s Eras docuseries faces fan backlash as Travis Kelce’s presence takes center stage","The legal dispute between Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni has shifted from a quiet courtroom matter into a sprawling Hollywood saga.

Megan Thee Stallion wins defamation case against Milagro Gramz



Lawsuit highlights wider concerns about online harassment of Megan Pete



Klay Thompson’s girlfriend Megan Thee Stallion secured a significant courtroom victory this week as a federal jury ruled that blogger Milagro Gramz defamed and targeted her online through years of harmful posts and an explicit AI-generated video.The decision drew national attention, partly because of Megan’s high-profile relationship with NBA star Klay Thompson and partly due to the lawsuit’s focus on deepfake abuse and digital harassment. The verdict offered the rapper a measure of relief after years of dealing with fallout from the 2020 shooting involving Tory Lanez.Jurors found that the online content aimed at Megan, born Megan Pete, caused real harm to her reputation and mental well-being. Their ruling confirmed that Gramz knowingly encouraged her audience to engage with false narratives that circulated across social platforms. While the court reduced the damages to $59,000, the outcome was still seen as a meaningful acknowledgment of the harassment she endured.The nine-member panel in the Southern District of Florida determined that Milagro Gramz, legally named Milagro Cooper, spread multiple false allegations about Megan Thee Stallion and amplified a deepfake video that portrayed her in a se*ual manner.Jurors concluded that Cooper “willfully encouraged” her followers to view the manipulated clip and pushed claims portraying Megan as a “mouthpiece,” a “puppet,” and a “paid surrogate” for Tory Lanez. The findings aligned with Megan’s long-standing position that these narratives compounded the trauma she experienced after Lanez shot her in 2020.The jury originally calculated damages at $75,000 before U.S. District Judge Cecilia M. Altonaga lowered the final figure. Cooper, who left court, responded by saying, “I’m not ecstatic. Of course you want things to go your way, but like I said, I respect the jury and what they decided.” Her attorney added that “at the end of the day it was not a complete win for any side.”Megan’s legal filings described a years-long effort by Cooper to discredit her following the shooting. She accused the blogger of “carrying out a public campaign to ‘denigrate, belittle, insult, and spread false statements’ about her,” pointing to conspiracies about the criminal case and a po*nographic deepfake circulated to tens of thousands of followers. Her attorneys argued that this pattern amounted to cyberstalking, emotional abuse, and intentional infliction of distress.The case also touched on broader free-speech debates. An attorney for Cooper said the judgment “raises serious concerns about the future of free speech online” and warned of a “chilling effect.” Still, legal analysts noted that Megan’s lawsuit fit within newer protections in Florida aimed at curbing nonconsensual AI-generated content.Also Read: Newlyweds Selena Gomez and Benny Blanco spotted courtside at Lakers game during Luka Doncic’s dominant night against Pelicans",Megan Thee Stallion wins defamation case against blogger Milagro Gramz.

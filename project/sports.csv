Arshdeep Singh dismissed Ryan Rickelton (13), while Aiden Markram (3) and Reeza Hendricks (24) fell to Chakravarthy, who delivered a sensational performance, finishing with figures of 5/17.However, Stubbs remained unflappable at the crease, striking key boundaries and keeping his side on track.Despite a mid-innings wobble, South Africa stayed composed, with Gerald Coetzee (19*) providing valuable support as the Proteas reached the target with just three wickets in hand.Chakravarthy’s heroic performance couldn’t save India, as South Africa levelled the series with a thrilling chase, leaving both teams with everything to play for in the remaining two games.",Varun Chakravarthy takes five wickets as South Africa beat India in second T20I.

England then hunted down the target comfortably, reaching 161 for three in just 14.4 overs.Buttler played a breathtaking innings, smashing eight fours and six sixes, leaving spectators in awe of his power-hitting.The skipper's exceptional batting display earned him the well-deserved ""Man of the Match"" award.""It was scratchy for the first couple of balls but when I got going I really enjoyed it. It was great to be back out there,"" said Buttler.England's chase got off to a shaky start when Phil Salt was dismissed on the first ball of the innings by spinner Akeal Hosein. However, Buttler's arrival at the crease injected immediate momentum into the innings.The Windies bowling attack, missing key players like Alzarri Joseph and Andre Russell, struggled to contain Buttler's onslaught.Debutant seamer Terrance Hinds, in particular, had a challenging introduction to international cricket, facing the brunt of Buttler's aggression.Buttler seemed destined for his second T20I century.

Will Jacks provided solid support to Buttler during their 129-run partnership for the second wicket. Jacks contributed 38 runs off 29 balls, hitting five fours and one six, before falling to Romario Shepherd.Shepherd claimed two wickets for the hosts, dismissing both Jacks and Buttler.

🔴 LIVE: India refuse to travel to Pakistan for Champions Trophy, want matches in Dubai | BTB Live

NEW DELHI: The International Cricket Council (ICC) has decided to cancel a significant event connected to the upcoming Champions Trophy, originally set to take place on November 11 in Lahore, according to a report by Cricbuzz.The cancellation stems from ongoing disagreements over the tournament's schedule, particularly regarding India's participation in the eight-team 50-over tournament, planned for February 19 to March 19, 2025.The ICC had intended to use the November 11 event to kick-off the tournament, marking 100 days until the championship began. However, these plans have been put on hold due to uncertainty surrounding India's willingness to travel to Pakistan. An ICC official has confirmed that the schedule is still under discussion with Pakistan , the host nation, and other participating countries.""The schedule is not confirmed, we are still in discussions with the host and participating nations on the Champions Trophy schedule . Once confirmed we will announce through our normal channels,"" an ICC official was quoted as saying by Cricbuzz.Although the ICC hasn't officially explained the cancellation, sources indicate that scheduling conflicts, exacerbated by India's reluctance to play in Pakistan, are the primary reasons. There are also suggestions that the ICC might cite Lahore's severe smog as a contributing factor, with some officials hinting that weather conditions could be used as a reason to postpone the event.The Champions Trophy was initially planned to be held across multiple cities in Pakistan, including Lahore, Rawalpindi, and Karachi. However, with the Board of Control for Cricket in India ( BCCI ) informing the ICC that it hasn't received government approval to send its team to Pakistan, a hybrid model for the tournament is looking increasingly likely. This arrangement would involve moving some matches, especially those featuring India, to the UAE.Mohsin Naqvi, the PCB chairman, has expressed his frustration over the lack of official communication regarding India's participation.""We have a clear stance that they must give it to us in writing if they [the Indian cricket board] have any issues. Till today, we have not spoken about any hybrid model, but we're ready to speak on this,"" Naqvi told reporters in Lahore recently. He also mentioned that neither the PCB nor the ICC has received any formal communication from the BCCI on this matter.India's original schedule had them facing Bangladesh on February 20, New Zealand on February 23, and Pakistan on March 1, all in Lahore. Adjustments to the tournament venues, if not the dates, seem unavoidable.","The ICC has decided to cancel a significant event connected to the upcoming Champions Trophy, originally set to take place on November 11 in Lahore.

#IPL retentions: CSK Will Definitely Go for Ashwin at the Mega Auction

NEW DELHI: India keeper-batsman Rishabh Pant will be the biggest player up for grabs in the upcoming Indian Premier League (IPL) auctions scheduled to held on November 24 and 25.Kasi Viswanathan, the CEO of the Chennai Super Kings CSK ), responded for the first time on Saturday to the escalating rumors that the team would sign Pant.A media source from Dainik Jagran suggested that Chennai had expressed interest in the wicketkeeper-batter for the upcoming season, which sparked rumors about Pant soon after India's successful T20 World Cup campaign ended.After Pant was left off of the Delhi Capitals' retention list, the rumors finally reached their zenith.As a result, Pant joined KL Rahul and Shreyas Iyer , three well-known Indian players who served as franchise leaders in the previous season, in the INR 2 crore price range for the two-day mega event in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.Will CSK participate in the fight to win Pant at the high-profile auction? Speaking with former CSK batsman Ambati Rayudu on Provoke TV, Kasi said that they are more interested in bringing back their own players and keeping a core lineup from the 2024 season than they are in chasing the big-name players with a meager auction purse.""We had discussions with Ruturaj, the captain, MS ( Dhoni ) and coach Stephen Fleming before we decided on the retentions. We were very clear that the players that helped the team grow, stabilise in the previous years were the ones very important for the CSK team to continue further,"" Kasi said.""It was very easy to decide on the retentions -- Gaikwad, Jaddu, MS, Shivam Dube and Matheesha Pathirana. But we knew that if we retain these players, we would have a lesser purse to go into the auction.

NEW DELHI: South Africa's one of the best fielders David Miller pulled off a spectacular one-handed catch to dismiss Tilak Varma in the second T20I between South Africa and India on Sunday, leaving fans and teammates alike stunned.The dismissal happened in the eighth over when South Africa’s captain, Aiden Markram , tossed one up outside off, inviting Tilak Varma to drive.Tilak, who had been playing a steady innings, attempted an aggressive shot but couldn’t get enough power behind it, lofting the ball towards cover.Miller, stationed at cover, instinctively stuck out his right hand and managed to pluck the ball out of the air in one swift, smooth movement.Watch:The timing of Miller’s catch was pivotal. At a crucial moment in India’s innings, Tilak was looking to anchor India through the middle overs, having scored a controlled 20 off 20 balls with one four and one six.His dismissal put further pressure on an already struggling Indian lineup, which had lost early wickets and was attempting to stabilize against a sharp South African attack.South Africa’s disciplined bowling strategy, led by Markram and supported by an agile fielding unit, had been keeping India on a tight leash.Miller's catch was a defining moment in the game, reminding everyone why he’s known as ""Killer Miller"" in all facets of the game.Tilak's departure further added to the pressure on Indian batters, who continued to struggle to build partnerships in the face of disciplined South African bowling.Following Tilak’s wicket, India’s middle and lower order couldn’t quite find the rhythm to push the score beyond 124/6 in their 20 overs.","South Africa's David Miller pulled off a spectacular one-handed catch to dismiss Tilak Varma in the second T20I between South Africa and India on Sunday.

NEW DELHI: Team India all-rounder Axar Patel became a victim of an unfortunate run-out, adding to India’s struggles during the second T20I between South Africa and India.The incident took place in the second last ball of the 12th over when Hardik Pandya firmly struck the ball straight back towards South African bowler Nqabayomzi Peter.The ball barely grazed Peter’s fingertips but still managed to redirect just enough to shatter the stumps at the non-striker’s end, catching Axar well outside his crease and ending his innings abruptly.Axar, who had been promoted to no. 5, was looking steady with a fluent 27 off 21 balls.Watch:He was building a partnership with Pandya to help stabilize India's innings after the early dismissals. His knock included four 4s and displayed a solid strike rate, giving India a brief glimmer of hope to put up a respectable score.However, the run-out shifted the momentum firmly in South Africa’s favour, marking India's fifth wicket at just 70 runs in 11.5 overs.South Africa’s decision to bowl first had paid off handsomely, with India already struggling against a sharp Proteas bowling attack led by Marco Jansen, who dismantled the top order early on.The team’s consistent pressure meant that India faced significant obstacles, and Axar’s dismissal added yet another blow.India will need to regroup to counter South Africa’s relentless bowling strategies.That said, the run-out encapsulated the uphill battle India faced throughout the innings, with their score at 86/5 at the end of 15 overs and limited resources left in their arsenal.",Axar Patel becomes a victim of an unfortunate run-out during the second T20I between South Africa and India.

"From grassroots to elite, Mumbai's IOT FC for record-breaking journey",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/top-stories/from-grassroots-to-elite-mumbais-iot-fc-for-record-breaking-journey/articleshow/115144417.cms,"Gaining three or more promotions in consecutive years in professional football is an exceptional achievement. Mumbai’s India On Track Football Club (IOT FC) has achieved this distinction in the last five years — rising from the lowest rung of the Mumbai Football League to the top at a breakneck speed. IOT FC is a grassroots football club founded in 2018, which has quickly become one of the most exciting teams in Mumbai football.In just four years, this senior men’s team has risen through the ranks of the Mumbai Football Association (MFA), achieving an unprecedented record: four consecutive league promotions in four seasons. In the 2024-25 season, this small club is going for a bigger record — winning the Mumbai Premier League, the top-tier football league and making it five in a row in the Mumbai Football Association’s Mumbai Football League, the second oldest football league in Asia after the Calcutta Football League Football leagues are usually organised in a pyramid system, so a club has to win the division or go through playoffs every year to achieve promotion to the higher division. Very few clubs around the world have managed to climb from the lowest to the top tier in a short period, clearing four divisions in four years. IOT FC is one of those that has achieved this feat. IOT FC’s story is one of grit, determination, and unparalleled consistency.They started their training sessions on Mumbai’s Juhu Beach, as there was no available ground for them to book. Yet, they rose through the ranks, achieving what only a few clubs, even on a global scale, can claim to have achieved. The club has been promoted four seasons in a row – a rare feat that only 15 other clubs in the world have managed to achieve joining the likes of Grazer AK (Austria), SV Rodinghausen and TV Herkenrath (Germany), SC Sagamihara and Iwaki FC (Japan), among others. What is remarkable is that IOT FC is one of the few clubs to do so in the last five years, further underscoring the magnitude of their achievement.What makes their achievements particularly noteworthy is that the club has made such progress without its own football ground, with the help of local talent, and without the financial clout enjoyed by other clubs in the top divisions of MFA. They have managed to keep their success graph despite the disruption caused by the Covid-19 pandemic.“We, as a club, have always been aligned to set winning processes. Although the intangibles of this process have been our values of commitment, honesty, sacrifice, and welfare of players and all people associated with the club. Hard work in training, opposition scouting, a clear tactical plan, game management, and the intangibles have made us successful so far,” says IOT FC head coach Yash Shah.After clinching four promotions in four years -- IOT has won one title and finished in the top two to gain automatic promotion in three others, the club will now be competing against the best football teams in Mumbai, showcasing the same drive, discipline and flair that have made them a formidable force in Mumbai football.What sets IOT FC apart is not just their impressive record but the values and vision that underpin the club. As a grassroots football organisation, the club was founded to nurture and develop local talent, and it continues to be a platform for aspiring footballers to grow and achieve their full potential. Their rapid rise through the MFA leagues is a testament not only to the talent and skill of the players but also to the dedication and strategic planning of the club’s management.IOT FC is more than just a football team; it is a symbol of ambition, resilience, and community. Their success has inspired countless young footballers across Mumbai, demonstrating what is possible when passion and hard work come together. As the team prepares to face Mumbai’s top clubs in the Premier League, they do so as a club that has earned the respect of both players and fans alike.“With India On Track FC, we set out to prove that grassroots football, when done right, when done with the values of discipline, integrity and a winning mindset, can achieve remarkable results. Our mission was to combine professional training with strong values, and I’m incredibly proud of how far we’ve come. Watching the team succeed season after season is a testament to that original vision, and we’re really looking forward to how IOT FC will grow, how its players will develop, and the opportunities we can give them for new beginnings, constant improvement, and a positive team environment,” says Gaurav Modwel, Chairman of IOT, who was previously the CEO of Pune City FC, a club that competed in the Indian Super League (ISL).At Pune City FC, he was instrumental in establishing the club’s presence and fostering a competitive football culture, and further influenced and impacted Indian sport, especially football, because of his deep focus on youth sports development. As IOT FC’s campaign in the Mumbai Premier League gathers pace, the focus is on maintaining the momentum that has carried them through four consecutive league titles. They are in Group B of the 18-team league and in the top half after three rounds and on course to achieving their ambition.The club’s ambition is not limited to just this season; they have their sights set on building a long-term legacy in Mumbai football and beyond. With a squad brimming with talent and a coaching team that has guided them to success year after year, IOT FC is well-positioned to continue their winning ways. This season, however, will be their toughest test yet. Competing against Mumbai’s elite, IOT FC will need to bring their very best to the pitch. But with the team’s track record, there is every reason to believe that they will rise to the challenge and continue to defy expectations.As the Mumbai Premier League gets underway, football fans across the city are eager to see whether IOT FC can make history by securing their fifth consecutive title. Whatever the outcome, one thing is certain: IOT FC is a club that has already made an indelible mark on Indian football, and their story is far from over.""It’s not just about winning titles – it’s about fostering a culture of excellence, discipline, and integrity. We want to give athletes the platform to realise their full potential and, in doing so, elevate Indian football, create team India’s next generation of players, and put India on the global stage,"" says Modwel.","India On Track Football Club (IOT FC) is a Mumbai-based grassroots football club.

Result:

CHENNAI: The landmark 1000th Indian Super League match between Chennaiyin FC and Mumbai City FC on Saturday was a slow burner.After a cagey first-half that ended goalless and had only sprinkles of clear-cut chances, the game sprang to life around the hour-mark. Defenders Ryan Edwards (60th minute) and Nathan Rodrigues (63rd) displayed their attacking prowess for Chennaiyin and Mumbai respectively, before the teams shook hands for a 1-1 stalemate at the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium .CFC's search for back-to-back wins continues and they now have 12 points from eight matches, while MCFC extended their unbeaten run to move to 10 points from seven games.In the first period, Vincy Barretto and Wilmar Jordan Gil came closest to opening the scoring for the hosts. Vincy went on a marauding run in a quick counter-attack and opted to shoot instead of finding one of three Chennaiyin attackers who were left unmarked in and around the box. Mumbai goalkeeper Phurba Lachenpa averted the danger with a save.The MCFC custodian then rose high to tip the ball over the bar after Gil's header was heading into the top-corner. Nikos Karelis, the striker at the other end, had a couple of half-chances but could not extend his scoring spree, just like Gil. Tiri's header went just a whisker away from the post, meaning no inroads were made in the first half.In the 60th minute, CFC captain Edwards made the 9,500-odd crowd erupt in jubilation by breaking the deadlock. Connor Shields, who has a penchant for crossing balls from the right flank, delivered a delicious free-kick into the 18-yard box. Centre-back Edwards got on the end of it and came up with a well-directed header that went in off the inside of the far post.Chennaiyin's lead dissipated even before the fans could fully celebrate Edwards' maiden goal of the ISL campaign. In the 63rd minute, Nathan, primarily a left-back, drew the visitors level with a headed goal of his own. Yoell van Nieff unleashed a near-perfect inswinging corner-kick, following which Nathan produced a looping header towards the far post. Having rippled the net in the 4-2 win over Kerala Blasters FC, Nathan made it two goals in as many matches.Both teams had an opportunity each to nick three points in the end. After being picked out in the area, CFC substitute Daniel Chima Chukwu opted for an audacious scissor-kick that went straight to Lachenpa. At the other end, Mumbai did not have a single attacker in the six-yard box when an inviting cross was put in from the left.Chennaiyin FC 1 (Ryan Edwards 60) drew with Mumbai City FC 1 (Nathan Rodrigues 63)",Chennaiyin FC and Mumbai City FC drew 1-1 in the 1000th Indian Super League match.

Wolves

get off the mark

Manchester City slumped to a fourth consecutive defeat after blowing the lead to lose 2-1 at Brighton, allowing Liverpool to move five points clear at the top of the Premier League with a 2-0 win against Aston Villa on Saturday.City had not suffered defeat in the league for nearly a year prior to losing at Bournemouth last weekend.But after also exiting the League Cup to Tottenham and being on the end of a 4-1 thrashing by Sporting Lisbon in the Champions League, Pep Guardiola has lost four straight matches for the first time in his illustrious managerial career.The English champions looked set to bounce back from their chastening night in Lisbon on Tuesday when Erling Haaland prodded in his 15th goal of the season at the second attempt after his initial effort was saved by Bart Verbruggen.City, though, were opened up at will in the second half and were finally punished by a pair of Brighton substitutes.Joao Pedro fired in the equaliser after City failed to clear in a goalmouth scramble.Matt O'Riley has had to wait for his Premier League debut after suffering a serious ankle injury days after sealing a move from Celtic.The Danish international marked his bow in style when he slotted in from Pedro's pass seven minutes from time.""We are not able to do 90 minutes right now. Four defeats in a row. We have to change things quick,"" Guardiola said.""Maybe after seven years winning six Premier Leagues, maybe one year another team deserves it.""Liverpool kicked off at Anfield just 30 minutes later and quickly capitalised on City's latest slip.In a superb counter-attack in the 20th minute, Mohamed Salah was sent racing clear by Virgil van Dijk.When Salah tumbled to the turf under pressure, Darwin Nunez seized on the loose ball and fired high into the net from an acute angle for his third goal this season.Salah's composed finish in the 84th minute after another rapid Liverpool raid sealed their ninth win in 11 league games and 15th victory in 17 matches in all competitions.Chasing a first English title since 2020, Liverpool, who finished a distant third to City last season, have been revitalised following Arne Slot's arrival from Feyenoord to replace Jurgen Klopp as manager in the close-season.Villa have slumped to eighth place after losing their last four games in all competitions.Wolves ended a wait since April for a Premier League win by beating fellow strugglers Southampton 2-0 to move off the foot of the table.Gary O'Neil was under huge pressure to deliver after a 13-game winless run in the top flight and got the perfect start when Pablo Sarabia swept home Matheus Cunha's pass for Wolves' fastest ever Premier League goal.Cunha smashed home a stunning second goal himself early in the second period to give Wolves a vital three points, which sees Southampton replace them at the bottom of the table.""He's huge for us. He has such ability,"" said O'Neil on Cunha's influence. ""A big win for us and Matheus Cunha had a big say in it.""Fulham moved into seventh by inflicting more misery on Crystal Palace with a 2-0 win at Selhurst Park.Emile Smith Rowe put Fulham ahead and Palace's Daichi Kamada saw red for a wild lunge on Kenny Tete before Harry Wilson wrapped up the points.Yoane Wissa scored a brace as Brentford twice came from behind to beat Bournemouth 3-2.Twice the in-form Cherries led through Evanilson and Justin Kluivert.But the Bees have taken 16 points from a possible 18 at home this season.Brentford quickly levelled on both occasions through Wissa and Mikkel Damsgaard.Wissa then completed the comeback with his seventh goal in eight league appearances this season.West Ham and Everton did little to quell the discontent among both fanbases in a 0-0 draw.",Manchester City slump to fourth consecutive defeat after losing 2-1 at Brighton. Liverpool move five points clear at the top of the Premier League with 2-0 win against Aston Villa. Matt O'Riley makes his Premier League debut for Wolves against Southampton.

HAMBURG: An incredible long-range goal from Jamal Musiala took Bayern Munich six clear atop the Bundesliga table with a 1-0 win at St Pauli on Saturday, while Borussia Dortmund lost again.St Pauli, promoted in the summer, fought hard against their heavily favoured opponents and wanted to avoid a repeat of the 8-1 thrashing handed out last time Bayern visited.Musiala, who scored the only goal in Wednesday's 1-0 win over Benfica, won the ball near the sideline and dribbled centrally before blasting from just under 30 metres, his shot bouncing in off the crossbar.The 21-year-old now has scored five in his past four games since returning from a hip injury.Bayern are now six points clear at the top of the table on 26 points, but RB Leipzig can cut the gap to three with a win in their home match against Borussia Moenchengladbach later on Saturday.Injury-hit Dortmund suffered yet another setback, losing 3-1 at Mainz after Emre Can was sent off in the 27th minute for a studs-up tackle on Lee Jae-sung.Normally a midfielder, Dortmund's injury crisis had pushed Can into central defence.His replacement after the red card, another midfielder in Felix Nmecha, was at fault nine minutes later when an unmarked Lee headed in.Dortmund's Serhou Guirassy won and converted a penalty to level things up but Jonathan Burkardt put Mainz back in front just before half-time, slamming in a Danny da Costa pass from close range.Paul Nebel added a third early in the second period to put Mainz in the driver's seat for their first home win of the season.Champions League finalists last season, Dortmund are struggling this year, particularly away from home, having lost their past six games in all competitions.Bayer Leverkusen 's title defence continued to stutter with a 1-1 draw at last-placed Bochum, who equalised in the final minute.Leverkusen were ahead from the 18th minute onwards after Florian Wirtz slid a ball across the turf and into the path of Patrik Schick, who blasted home.The visitors seemed on track for victory until Bochum's Koji Miyoshi popped up to grab a loose ball after a mistake from Jonathan Tah and slide it in at the near post.Leverkusen are now nine points behind Bayern and have dropped 13 points this campaign, more than they did across all 34 games last season.The draw was just Bochum's second point this season after 10 games in their first match under veteran coach Dieter Hecking.Elsewhere, Werder Bremen won 2-1 at home against Holstein Kiel thanks to an 89th-minute goal from Oliver Burke after Phil Harres' second-half strike cancelled out Jens Stage's opener for the hosts just after the half-hour.","Bayern Munich beat St Pauli 1-0 to go six points clear at the top of the Bundesliga table. Jamal Musiala scored the only goal with a long-range strike from just under 30 metres. Borussia Dortmund lost 3-1 at home to Mainz after having Emre Can sent off.

Czech Barbora Krejcikova on Sunday called for respect and professionalism in sports media as she hit out at ""unprofessional"" remarks made about her appearance during a broadcast on the Tennis Channel .Wimbledon champion Krejcikova was competing at the WTA Finals in Riyadh this week, where she was beaten 6-3 7-5 by Olympic gold medallist Zheng Qinwen in the semi-finals.During the Tennis Channel's coverage of the event on Friday, journalist Jon Wertheim, seemingly unaware that he was on air, made a comment about Krejcikova's forehead which was met with criticism on social media.""As an athlete who has dedicated herself to this sport, it was disappointing to see this type of unprofessional commentary,"" world number 13 Krejcikova wrote in a post on X.""This isn't the first time something like this is happening in (the) sports world. I've often chosen not to speak up, but I believe it's time to address the need for respect and professionalism in sports media.""These moments distract from the true essence of sport and the dedication all athletes bring to the field. I love tennis deeply, and I want to see it represented in a way that honours the commitment we make to compete at this level.""Wertheim apologised for the comments in a post on X, saying: ""During a Tennis Channel studio show on Friday, I made some deeply regrettable comments off-air.""I acknowledge them. I apologise for them. I reached out immediately and apologised to the player... I realise: I am not the victim here.

RIYADH: Coco Gauff became the youngest player to win the WTA Finals title in 20 years with a gruelling 3-6, 6-4, 7-6 (7/2) victory over Olympic champion Zheng Qinwen in Riyadh on Saturday.The 20-year-old Gauff rallied back from 3-6, 1-3 down, and erased a one-break deficit twice in the decider, to overcome Zheng in three hours and four minutes – the second-longest WTA final in 2024.""This means a lot to me,"" said Gauff.""This is the first professional women's tennis event here in Saudi Arabia and I'll forever be etched in history in that standard.""It's the second biggest title in our sport, so it means a lot. And just to be etched in history forever, it's pretty cool and hopefully there's more events here.""By clinching the trophy, Gauff pocketed a record $4,805,000 – which is the largest ever payout at a professional, sanctioned tour event.Gauff had knocked out the world's top two players, Aryna Sabalenka and Iga Swiatek, en route to the final and picked up her fourth top-eight win of the week with an impressive physical performance against Zheng.The American was unaware she had earned a record prize cheque and laughed when she was told how much she made by a reporter.""I don't know what I'll do with it, that's a lot of money. What you said? 4.8 (million)? I hope I'm one of the highest paid female tennis players this year, or athletes, so that would be exciting,"" she said.Zheng is just the second Asian woman, behind Li Na in 2013, to reach the singles championship match at a WTA Finals.The Chinese star wraps up her breakthrough 2024 campaign having won 31 of her last 37 matches, and will rise to a career-high number five in the world on Monday.""The match today came down to just a couple of important points. It was very close. And at the end, when you play these type of matches, it's not about tennis, it's about choices on court,"" said Zheng.""It hurts to lose this match of course but I think it's better I forget it and move on for my next steps.""- Youngest finalists in two decades -Contesting the youngest final at the WTA Finals since Maria Sharapova's win over Serena Williams in 2004, Gauff and Zheng, 22, brought their A-game from the start.It was Zheng who faced more pressure on serve in the opening games, saving a number of break points to keep things on level terms with her American opponent.The rallies got longer and more physically taxing and it was Gauff who cracked first, double-faulting to hand Zheng a 5-3 lead.Zheng had to save a break point while serving for the set, which she closed on a netted backhand from Gauff.The seventh seed kept up her momentum and clinched a fifth game in a row to go up 2-0 early in the second set.Gauff stopped the bleeding though and fought her way back to level for 3-3, finally claiming her first break of serve on her sixth opportunity of the match. Zheng appeared to have lost a bit of her speed and Gauff took full advantage of the situation.The American made it four games in a row to put herself in the position to serve for the second set but couldn't close, as Zheng saved a pair of set points to peg her opponent back and break. Gauff retaliated the next game to scoop the second set and force a decider.Gauff dropped serve at the start of the final set but pulled off an incredible stretch volley to strike back and even the score 2-2.Zheng mustered all the power she could, unleashing huge serves and groundstrokes to create another gap and surged ahead 5-3.Gauff would not relent and once again wiped her deficit. Zheng saved two championship points on her own serve in game 12 and carried the match into a deciding tiebreak.Gauff was dialled in for the breaker, racing to a 6-0 advantage and Zheng couldn't catch up as the world number three completed a remarkable comeback victory on her fifth opportunity.The doubles title in Riyadh was secured by Canadian Gabriela Dabrowski and New Zealand's Erin Routliffe, who avenged their Wimbledon final loss to Taylor Townsend and Katerina Siniakova by defeating the American-Czech duo 7-5, 6-3.","Coco Gauff becomes youngest player to win WTA Finals title in 20 years. 20-year- old beats Olympic champion Zheng Qinwen 3-6, 6-4, 7-6 (7/2) in Riyadh.

Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz are set to further their emerging rivalry when the ATP Finals commence on Sunday, marking the first time in 23 years that the event will be held without any of the Big Three.Sinner, the top-ranked player, and No. 3 Alcaraz each claimed two Grand Slam titles this year, so a matchup between them in Turin would be fitting.In the draw on Thursday , Sinner and Alcaraz were placed in separate groups. Sinner will compete in the Ilie Nastase Group alongside Daniil Medvedev, Taylor Fritz, and Alex de Minaur, while Alcaraz will be in the John Newcombe Group with Alexander Zverev, Casper Ruud, and Andrey Rublev. The top two players from each group will advance to the semifinals following the round-robin stage.After withdrawing from last week's Paris Masters due to illness, Sinner arrived in Turin early to prepare. “For me, this is the main event of the end of the year,” he stated.Notably absent is defending champion Novak Djokovic, who withdrew on Tuesday due to an unspecified injury . This is the first year since 2001 that the finals will occur without at least one of Djokovic, Roger Federer, or Rafael Nadal. Additionally, this season also marks the first time since 2002 that no member of that trio has won a Grand Slam title.Djokovic holds the record for the most ATP Finals victories, having won seven times and defeating Sinner in the final last year. Federer, who retired in 2022, won the event six times, while Nadal, who will retire after the Davis Cup next week, was a finalist twice but never secured a title.“It’s strange not to see Novak here, given all his success,” Zverev remarked. “When I won in 2018, you needed to defeat at least two of the top three players. It feels different now. But with Jannik and Carlos emerging, the focus has shifted to new talent. You have to overcome them to win big tournaments. They've both won two Grand Slams this year and undoubtedly rank among the best players in the world.”As the sole Italian in the competition, Sinner will attract significant attention, particularly since this is his first home appearance following the announcement of positive drug tests earlier this year before his US Open title.The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) appealed a decision exonerating Sinner, and the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) is expected to issue a ruling early next year. Sinner expressed uncertainty over updates, emphasising his positive outlook despite the challenging circumstance.Alcaraz has defeated Sinner in all three of their official meetings this year and currently leads their overall head-to-head 6-4.Sinner's year started with an Australian Open victory — the first Grand Slam title for an Italian man since Adriano Panatta's 1976 French Open win. Alcaraz subsequently secured the French Open and Wimbledon titles, bringing his career total to four Grand Slams. Sinner later triumphed at the US Open. Notably, Sinner defeated Alcaraz during the Six Kings Slam exhibition in Saudi Arabia last month.Zverev, who has previously won the finals in London in 2018 and in Turin in 2021, seeks to claim his third title. Medvedev, the only other player in the field with a finals win, lifted the trophy in 2020.Zverev arrives in promising form following a title victory at the Paris Masters , which propelled him past Alcaraz to No. 2 in the rankings.Fritz aims to build on his maiden Grand Slam final appearance in New York, Ruud was a finalist in 2022, De Minaur is making his debut in the tournament, and Rublev is competing for the fifth consecutive year.The ATP Finals, featuring the top eight singles players and doubles teams, begins on November 10 and runs until November 17.The ATP Finals will be contested in Turin, Italy for the fourth consecutive year. The event will take place at the Inalpi Arena.Ilie Nastase Group: Jannik Sinner (1), Daniil Medvedev (4), Taylor Fritz (5), Alex de Minaur (7)John Newcombe Group: Alexander Zverev (2), Carlos Alcaraz (3), Casper Ruud (6), Andrey Rublev (8)Bob Bryan Group: Marcelo Arevalo and Mate Pavic (1), Simone Bolelli and Andrea Vavassori (4), Rohan Bopanna and Matthew Ebden (6), Kevin Krawietz and Tim Puetz (8)zverevMike Bryan Group: Marcel Granollers and Horacio Zeballos (2), Wesley Koolhof and Nikola Mektic (3), Max Purcell and Jordan Thompson (5), Harri Heliovaara and Henry Patten (7)The champion of the ATP Finals will receive $4.8 million, the largest prize in men’s tennis history. This amount surpasses the earnings from Sinner and Alcaraz’s Grand Slam victories this year, with Sinner earning $3.6 million for the US Open and Alcaraz $3.45 million (or £2.7 million) for Wimbledon.The singles and doubles competitions will take place in a round-robin format. The players and teams will play each other(s) once and the top two in singles/doubles will advance to the semi-finals. The top player/team from each group will face the No. 2 placed player/team in the other group.The ATP Finals 2024 will be available on TV on Sony Sports Network in India.The tournament will be live streamed on SonyLiv app and website in India.","The ATP Finals will take place in Turin, Italy, for the fourth consecutive year.

Riyadh:

Defending WTA Finals champion Iga Swiatek was eliminated from the season-ending championship on Thursday after Barbora Krejcikova's 7-5 6-4 win over Coco Gauff meant the Polish world number two failed to advance to the last four.Gauff was already guaranteed to make the semis, but five-times Grand Slam champion Swiatek needed the American to beat eighth-seeded Czech Krejcikova who required a victory herself to progress.The 13th-ranked Krejcikova took a tight first set, which lasted 54 minutes, after saving four break points, wrapping it up with a powerful backhand that zipped down the line.Former US Open champion Gauff, who had not dropped a set in the tournament before the contest, was hurt by unforced errors — 23 alone in the opener.The second set was once again a close affair, but the Wimbledon champion held her nerve to secure the win in one hour and 42 minutes.""This is a big win for me and really happy with how I played and it was a really good match,"" the 27-year-old Krejcikova said. ""It's tough, it was up and down. The Wimbledon victory is the highest point in my career so far.""Being here and reaching the semi-final, it's something unimaginable. I'm really proud of myself and I'm looking forward to the new challenges.""Krejcikova is the lowest-ranked player to book a spot in the semis at the WTA Finals since Sandrine Testud (14) in 2001.Gauff will face world number one Aryna Sabalenka in a blockbuster semi-final, while Krejcikova will take on China's Olympic champion Zheng Qinwen .Earlier Swiatek had produced a ruthless performance to dismantle Daria Kasatkina 6-1 6-0, wasting little time in asserting herself as she raced to a 5-0 lead in the opening set which she wrapped up with an ace.Having replaced Jessica Pegula after the American withdrew due to a left knee injury, world number nine Kasatkina was demolished in the second set as Swiatek sealed the win in 51 minutes, making it the fastest match at the WTA Finals in eight years.Swiatek won 72% of her points on serve and thumped 15 winners as she extended her head-to-head advantage over the 27-year-old Russian to 6-1.Kasatkina is not the first player to be steam-rollered at the WTA Finals by Swiatek, who took her tally of 6-0 set wins at the tournament to five.The 23-year-old Pole equalled Serena Williams' total of 6-0 set wins at the event and is now only behind greats Martina Navratilova (12), Chris Evert and Steffi Graf (both seven).",Defending WTA Finals champion Iga Swiatek is eliminated from the season-ending championship.

Coco Gauff posted a rare victory over Iga Swiatek to punch her ticket to the semi-finals of the WTA Finals in Riyadh on Tuesday, ensuring Aryna Sabalenka will finish the year as the world number one Swiatek, the defending champion, was in a direct battle with Sabalenka for the top spot this week but needed a win over Gauff to keep her chances alive of leapfrogging her Belarusian rival.Gauff, 20, entered the contest having lost 11 of her 12 previous meetings with Swiatek, with the American's sole victory coming in Cincinnati last year.But she turned the tables on Swiatek on Tuesday, defeating the second seed 6-3, 6-4 to make it two straight-sets wins from two round-robin matches in Riyadh this week.""It feels great. I knew going into the match that despite our head-to-head I had a lot of confidence going in,"" said Gauff, who hit 11 double faults during the one-hour 48-minute showdown.With the exception of the opening game of the match, Gauff had break point opportunities in every Swiatek service game in the first set.The American third seed made her move in game seven, breaking for 4-3, and she closed out the set with a second break of serve, taking the lead in 49 minutes.Swiatek needed six break points in a marathon third game of the second set to finally take down the Gauff serve but she couldn't consolidate her advantage.They traded breaks again, as Gauff's double-fault tally went up to double digits and Swiatek racked up the errors.It was Gauff who eventually steadied the ship, and wrapped up the victory on Swiatek's 47th unforced error of the match.Swiatek, a five-time major champion, admits her two-month break between the US Open and the WTA Finals and the fact she is playing her first tournament with her new coach Wim Fissette have made things ""a bit more tricky and different than usual"".""But I'll force myself to work even better in the next match,"" the Pole added.Earlier in the day, Barbora Krejcikova ended Jessica Pegula's chances of qualifying for the semi-finals, defeating the sixth-seeded American 6-3, 6-3.A runner-up at the WTA Finals last year, Pegula suffered her second straight-sets defeat of the week and enters her final round-robin match against Swiatek on Thursday anchoring the Orange Group with zero sets won.Eighth-seeded Krejcikova bounced back from her opening loss to Swiatek to keep her hopes of making the final four alive.""I was fighting for every ball and I felt that I really have to play my best tennis and I was trying to be really solid and trying to put as many balls to the other side as I could,"" said Krejcikova, who picked up just her 20th match win of the season.""I'm definitely proud. I had some very high parts of the season, especially winning Wimbledon, that's something indescribable. And being here in the Finals is a huge privilege. It's nice to get the win and still be part of the event.""Despite being ranked number 13 in the world, Krejcikova qualified for these WTA Finals thanks to a new rule introduced by the WTA that gave priority to a player who has won a Grand Slam this season, while maintaining a ranking between 9 and 20, over a player ranked number eight in the Race.As the reigning Wimbledon champion, Krejcikova claimed the final qualifying spot in Riyadh over world number eight Emma Navarro.Krejcikova squandered a 6-4, 3-0 lead against Swiatek in her opener two days ago and made sure there was no repeat scenario against Pegula on Tuesday.The crafty Czech fired 11 aces and broke Pegula four times to wrap up the win in 69 minutes.Both Krejcikova and Swiatek will have to wait until Thursday's matches to learn their qualification fate in Riyadh.","Coco Gauff beats Iga Swiatek 6-3, 6-4 to reach WTA Finals semi-finals.

No regrets, its not end of the world: Sindhu on Olympics

'Just wait for the magic to start'

NEW DELHI: Insisting that she still has a lot to offer and potential to win many more titles on the demanding BWF circuit, star Indian shuttler PV Sindhu on Friday said the 2028 Los Angeles Games remains on her radar.By the time the biggest sporting show on earth moves to the American shores, Sindhu will be 33. However, the two-time Olympic medallist says if she remains injury-free and in peak physical condition, she will aim for a third medal.A former world champion, Sindhu, who won silver at the 2016 Rio Olympics and bronze at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, returned empty-handed from the Paris Games after her unexpected exit in the pre-quarterfinals.""If I'm fit, if I'm able to do it, if I'm injury free, then definitely yes I will compete at LA. That's what I can tell you,"" the 29-year-old from Hyderabad told PTI.Sindhu had entered the Paris Games with high expectations under the mentorship of legendary Prakash Padukone but was knocked out early after losing to China's He Bing Jiao in the Round of 16.""It does happen at times. I had amazing two Olympics and in the third one, I couldn't get a medal. But I think I played well. I learn from my mistakes and come back stronger. It's not just over with it. I am looking one year at a time and now the next Olympics is again four years down the line.""So the main aim and goal is to stay fit and stay motivated and be injury free. And enjoy what I do.""Sindhu stressed that she has no regrets despite her early exit in Paris, saying, ""It's not the end of the world.""""I can see myself going there for at least the next couple of years now. I don't hate it or anything, it's fine, I need to come out of it. I don't have any regrets, it's not just over for me. I definitely would want to play a lot more and why not?""Sindhu believes she still has potential to win more titles and continue inspiring the next generation of Indian athletes.""There's always more to strive for. I want to win more titles, stand on more podiums and of course, ultimately leave a legacy that inspires the next generation of Indian athletes,"" said the Commonwealth Games champion.""I'm committed to pushing my limits and making the most of every opportunity in my career. I want to win a lot more and I have it in me.""Sindhu has made several changes to her coaching staff in her quest to regain her glory. After winning bronze at Tokyo with South Korean coach Park Tae Sang , she worked with SAI coach Vidhi Chaudhary and All England champion Muhammad Hafiz Hashim before joining the Padukone-Dravid Badminton Academy (PPBA) with coach Agus Dwi Santoso to prepare for the Paris Games.After her Paris exit, she brought in Anup Sridhar and former World No. 5 Lee Hyun-il for the rest of the season.""Sometimes, when you need a change, you need a change. I have had good coaches, good support system. I wanted some change after Park. Then I had a couple of them and I think right now it's Lee and Anup.""You need to do what is best for you.""Sindhu is now focussing on the next events in Japan and China.""I'm in good shape, physically and mentally I'm fit. We've been working on different aspects, on speed and defence. It's always good to learn new things from different coaches, which will help in your game.""So it's going on really well and I hope, you know, this time in Japan and China, I hope I do well with their guidance. So, just that you'll have to just wait for the magic to start.""In addition to her on-court commitments, Sindhu has also launched the 'PV Sindhu Centre for Badminton and Sports Excellence' in Visakhapatnam.""I bought this land before, the academy will take one and a half years to complete. The vision is to inspire and nurture the next generation of champions. We aim to create a world-class specialty for young athletes, regardless of their backgrounds.""","Two-time Olympic medallist says if she remains injury-free and in peak physical condition, she will aim for a third medal.

SA20: Faf du Plessis on Joburg Super Kings squad, the Wanderers, and longevity

AB de Villiers on SA20, Indian players in T20 leagues, learnings from IPL

Jacques Kallis answers what makes SA20 special

South African cricket is currently in a state where it’s pinch me, wake up, everybody’s dreaming territory.After an administrative malaise which inadvertently led to the South African men's team, in particular, stumbling for a few years, the Rainbow Nation is now up and running again.The women’s team kickstarted the revolution by shattering the glass ceiling of reaching a first-ever ICC T20 Women’s World Cup final. They repeated the act the very next year in the UAE.Not to be outdone, the men’s team followed suit by progressing to their maiden ICC T20 World Cup final in Barbados last year and now, the Test side have topped the World Test Championship table to earn a spot at the main dining table at Lord’s in June.All of these achievements over the past two years coincided with the launch of the SA20 – the domestic T20 competition that has been an astounding success on the field whilst providing a much-needed financial boost to Cricket South Africa ’s balance sheet.The third instalment is set to get underway in Gqeberha on Thursday when back-to-back champions Sunrisers Eastern Cape host MI Cape Town at St George’s Park with the excitement reaching an all-time in South Africa.“I think from the beginning we were open and honest about bridging the gap between domestic cricket and international standards. To have six franchises that are competitive and bring out top support teams and then the players are also playing with and against the best players in the world,” SA20 Commissioner Graeme Smith said.“Then you add crowds and production… I remember season 1 where so many young players hadn't experienced such television productions before. Hopefully that will start developing more players pushing for places within the Proteas.”Smith feels that SA20 is ready to take the game in South Africa to even greater heights in Season 3.“Two seasons in I feel we are now an established product. We’re probably the biggest league outside of the IPL. Being able to attract the six franchises that we have, they very professional, very competitive,” the former Proteas captain said.“We’ve had quality local and international players. The squads look even stronger in Season 3. You look across the squads and you can so see many matchups.“Every year the cricket is getting better and seeing the progression of players is key to me. From a fan perspective, we are investing heavily again. There is something for everyone from the kids to adults who want to enjoy a really good experience inside the stadium,” he added.The season opener will feature a blockbuster face-off between the Sunrisers Eastern Cape and MI Cape Town.It is, of course, a rematch for two skippers Aiden Markram (Sunrisers) and Rashid Khan (MI Cape Town) after they last went head-to-head in the ICC T20 World Cup semi-final in Tarouba, Trinidad.This is but one of the subplots to look forward to over the month-long competition that will no doubt captivate audiences both in South African and abroad.","South African cricket is currently in a state where it’s pinch me, wake up, everybody's dreaming territory.

NEW DELHI:

After enduring a tough Test season, the national selectors will have a tricky selection meeting looking ahead to the Champions Trophy next month. While all the talk has been around Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli 's Test form, TOI understands that Ravindra Jadeja 's future across formats hangs in balance.According to BCCI sources, the team management under coach Gautam Gambhir and selectors is keen on getting a core ready for the 2027 ODI World Cup. Jadeja's off-colour performances in both Tests and white-ball cricket is a cause for concern. It will be interesting to see if they start the planning for the ODI World Cup with the Champions Trophy itself.""Gambhir has been very assertive about creating core teams according to formats. As of now, he hasn't quite tinkered with the longer formats but has a clear vision for creating a strong base for the ODI World Cup. He is keen on giving exposure to a few more identified players,"" a BCCI source told TOI. ""It's all about when the selectors decide the transition needs to kick in. They will discuss if they want to go with a safe option in Jadeja or move on right now,"" the source added.The selectors have been on the fence with Jadeja in ODIs. Jadeja's batting prowess has been on the decline. He hasn't had the desired impact with the bat coming at No.7 in ODIs over the last two years. For someone who is tasked with raising the run-rate at the back-end of an innings, Jadeja's strike rate has been as low as 75. He was not picked for the ODI series in Sri Lanka after he announced his T20I retirement post the T20 World cup triumph in July last year.Also See: Champions Trophy Full Fixtures ""Even in Test cricket, he has struggled to get going, though his bowling has been steady. There is an urge to move on from him, especially in the ODI format. It will be a tough call in the coming days,"" the source said. Axar Patel 's consistency poses a big challenge for Jadeja. He has been groomed as Jadeja's like-for-like replacement. Washington Sundar 's emergence as a steady off-spinner is also seen as a big positive but he may still have to do more with his power-hitting skills.Kuldeep Yadav's fitness is being closely monitored and the BCCI medical team expects him to be fit in time for the Champions Trophy.""When it comes to Test cricket, Jadeja is still fairly in contention for the England tour due to lack of experience in the middle order. But the selectors will have to take a call during the home season. For the Champions Trophy, selectors will be aware that pitches in Dubai have historically been helpful to slow bowlers,"" the source said.The selectors may be tempted to pick an extra left-hander in the batting lineup. In that case, Axar has shown that he can bat up the order should a crisis arise.",The selectors have been on the fence with Ravindra Jadeja in ODIs.

Two-tier system: Cricket faces its latest test,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/two-tier-system-cricket-faces-its-latest-test/articleshow/117069665.cms,"West Indies Test team (ANI Photo)

Hardly had the dust settled on the Border-Gavaskar series Down Under when a piece of news floated and created a flutter in the cricketing world. It has emerged that Australia , England, India, and the International Cricket Council’s new chair, Jay Shah , are in talks to split Test cricket into two divisions so that the Big Three can play each other more often in blockbuster series.According to a report in the Australian newspaper The Age, Cricket Australia chair Mike Baird and England Cricket Board boss Richard Thompson are set to meet later this month, with a two-tier structure for Test cricket on the agenda.The discussions around this concept have gained momentum due to the 2024-25 BGT series, comprising five Tests, being the fourth-best attended series in Australia, with record crowds in Melbourne and Sydney, alongside high TV viewership.However, according to the report, any plan to move to two divisions in Test cricket would only take effect after the current Future Tours Programme concludes in 2027. This is also the year when a 150th-anniversary Test match between Australia and England is scheduled at the MCG.As per the proposal, India, Australia, and England would no longer be required to play all cricketing nations and could rejig their cycles to play each other twice every three years, rather than twice every four years as is currently the case. The ICC has remained silent when asked for a reaction.Ironically, this development comes at a time when Australia is set to play South Africa—often excluded from the ‘Big Three’ plans—in the World Test Championship final at Lord’s in June.The concept has its loyal supporters. Commentating on SEN Radio during the fifth Test at Sydney, former India coach Ravi Shastri expressed concern over the crowded schedule, advocating for more “best versus the best” matches in Test cricket. “I’ve always believed that if you want Test cricket to survive and thrive, this is the way to go. The top teams should play each other more often, creating a contest,” Shastri said.The potential impact on the development—and even survival—of Test cricket in the West Indies, once a cricketing powerhouse, is troubling. Naturally, voices from the West Indies have expressed concern. “A two-tier system makes sense, but space must be made for top nations to tour those in the lower bracket, or smaller nations will disappear,” warned West Indies fast-bowling legend Michael Holding in his column in The Telegraph.Holding’s former captain Clive Lloyd also expressed his unease, believing that efforts should instead focus on ensuring struggling teams get more opportunities to play against the top sides.“I think it will be terrible for all those countries who worked so hard to achieve Test status. Now they’ll be relegated to playing among themselves in the lower section. How will they reach the top? (Only) by playing against better teams,” said the 80-year-old during an online media interaction.“Honestly, a two-tier system shouldn’t happen. It’s not ideal because only the top three teams will earn more revenue,” a former Indian cricketer of repute told TOI, highlighting the move’s economic imbalance. “And if you’re talking about quality, it’s not as though India played high-class cricket in Australia.Instead of this, the ICC should support smaller, weaker cricketing nations and focus on improving their skill levels. A proper WTC cycle, where everyone plays everyone, would be a better idea. In this WTC cycle, even Sri Lanka and Bangladesh had a chance of making it to the final at one stage. Almost all the teams were winning away from home and beating each other,” he said.It is important to note that 2024 was a year of unexpected results in Test cricket, making it an unusually exciting period for the red-ball format. This included West Indies stunning Australia in a pink-ball Test at the Gabba in Brisbane and India’s 3-1 defeat in the BGT last week. In this context, many argue that the past year has seen the rebirth of Test cricket.“A couple of years back, in 2022, Bangladesh secured their maiden Test win in New Zealand at Mount Maunganui. We need to ensure that Test cricket remains alive and exciting. Who says Test cricket is dying? There are matches lasting the full five days too,” said the cricketer.Apart from the skewed revenue sharing, there is also a practical issue with this concept. “I feel that this idea would be good and feasible if there were 15 teams playing Test cricket,” said former India wicketkeeper and chief selector Kiran More . “At the moment, that isn’t the case. You just have nine to ten countries playing the five-day game. How much can you shuffle between so few teams in two tiers?” asked More.Back home, domestic cricket stalwarts saw shades of the Ranji structure in the concept. “It’s a very good idea. If you can have six top cricketing nations in Tier 1 and six in Tier 2, it could work well,” said current UAE head coach Lalchand Rajput. “A lower-ranked team like Zimbabwe, for example, would get hammered if it played against India or Australia. After the end of a WTC cycle, the bottom two in the top six could be relegated to the second tier, while the top two could be promoted for the next WTC cycle. This would mean that there would be something to play for in all the WTC matches,” explained the former India opener.“Like the Ranji Trophy, relegation and promotion would make things more exciting. A two-tier system would ensure that the best teams get to play against each other more often, leading to healthy competition. The lower-ranked teams would have the motivation to perform well, beat the top sides, and move up to Tier 1, while Tier 1 teams would strive to maintain their position,” he said. “Currently, West Indies, and to an extent even Sri Lanka, don’t have strong Test teams, which means that the top sides look to secure big wins against them to accumulate points for WTC final qualification,” added Rajput.Since its inception in 2019, the success of the WTC has shown that change in Test cricket isn’t always detrimental. With broadcasters eager for more matches involving India, England, and Australia, the ICC, under its new chair Jay Shah, supported by England and Australia, will undoubtedly think carefully about the two-tier concept.In a potential win-win, could this also free up space for a second IPL in the September-October window—a lucrative prospect the BCCI has long been keen on? Watch this space!","Cricket Australia, England, India, and the International Cricket Council’s new chair, Jay Shah, are in talks to split Test cricket into two divisions.

IOA president PT Usha calls out ministry amid tension over IGU elections,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/more-sports/others/ioa-president-pt-usha-calls-out-ministry-amid-tension-over-igu-elections/articleshow/117069317.cms,"PT Usha (PTI Photo)

NEW DELHI: In a rare occurrence which doesn’t augur well for the country’s sporting ambitions, Indian Olympic Association (IOA) president P T Usha has accused the sports ministry of interfering in the autonomy of national federations and undermining the credibility of sports governance and fair play “with its selective approach” towards certain factions of the NSFs it wishes to back.Usha, who is a BJP nominated MP in the Rajya Sabha and heads the panel of vice-chairman of the House, alleged in her strongly-worded letter to sports minister Mansukh Mandaviya that his ministry staff doesn’t properly apprise him of important issues concerning the NSFs, including the Indian Golf Union (IGU) polls.Usha’s outburst came in reaction to a letter issued by an under secretary on Jan 2, in which the ministry official criticised the IOA for recognising the Harish Shetty-led faction, which won the IGU elections . Two Annual General Meetings (AGMs) were held on Dec 15 to elect the new IGU office-bearers. In one AGM. Shetty was elected president with Justice OP Garg (Retd) as the returning officer (RO). At the other AGM, Brijender Singh was re-elected to the top post with retired Punjab and Haryana High Court judge, Rameshwar Malik, as the RO.IOA later recognised Shetty-led panel for meeting the quorum – the AGM had an attendance of 21 out of the total 31 state golf associations. (SGAs). The AGM chaired by Singh saw the participation of only nine recognised SGAs.“The manner in which this letter has been issued appears procedurally incorrect and reflects a lack of verification of the facts on record and a complete non application of mind by the under secretary. Since I have assumed office in the lOA, it has become more and more apparent that the staff of the ministry deliberately never appraises the true and correct facts to the minister. It’s troubling that the ministry has placed undue emphasis on the mere updating of the International Golf Federation (IGF) website as a basis for granting recognition to the faction of IGU. Such reliance on superficial factors cannot be the foundation for granting recognition to an NSF,” Usha wrote in her reply to Mandaviya.“I urge the ministry to take corrective action to ensure adherence to the principles of transparency, accountability, and compliance with the national sports development code 2011 and recall its letter dated 28 Dec 2024, granting recognition to the illegal elections to the faction of IGU which did not meet the mandatory quorum for conduct of an AGM as required by its own constitution. The selective application of norms undermines the credibility of sports governance in India and the spirit of fair play that we aim to uphold. I look forward to your intervention to address these concerns at the earliest,” she added.Usha pointed out that NSFs such as equestrian, yachting etc. which have failed to conduct elections after completion of their term almost three years back continue to enjoy recognition from the ministry in clear violation of the sports code. She also cited the delay in providing recognition to the Wrestling Federation of India (WFI) by the ministry.“WFI has continued to select and send its teams for all international events of UWW and for the Olympic Games, despite the same the ministry still holding back its recognition for unknown reasons since Dec 2023. This has been nothing but an attempt to interfere in the autonomy of the NSFs by the MYAS, despite there being many warnings by the UWW and the IOC not to interfere in the WFI affairs,” she said.",IOA president P T Usha has accused the sports ministry of interfering in the autonomy of national federations.

Gautam Gambhir press conference: On Kohli, Rohit and dressing room

It doesn't read too flattering, TOI's Report Card following India's performance in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy Down Under. Apart from topper Jasprit Bumrah and new boy, Jaiswal, the rest disappointed, were poor in application and betrayed. A lack of depth that led to an embarrassing 3-1 verdict in Australia's favour. Hindol Basu gives out the grades, return it signed at your own risk.If he could have been rated more than 10, Bumrah would deserve it for his superlative, superhuman performance. Pivotal in keeping India competitive in the series, he was the standout performer, a show which earned him the Player of the Series award.On his first tour to Australia, Jaiswal emerged as India's highest run-scorer with 391 runs at an average of 43.44, including a century and two halfcenturies. His aggressive yet calculated knock of 161 in the Perth Test helped India start the series on a victorious note. In Melbourne too, his twin 80s raised India's hopes for a draw, but it wasn't to be.Rahul had a mixed series, reflecting both promise and inconsistency. He scored 276 runs at an average of 30.66, including two half-centuries: 84 in Brisbane and 77 in Perth. His 201-run opening partnership with Jaiswal in Perth was the highlight, but inconsistency plagued him in the subsequent matches.Kohli's form was below par – he managed only 190 runs at an average of 23.75. Despite a century in Perth, his on-field frustrations were evident throughout the series. Kohli's struggles were characterized by a recurring weakness: being dismissed 8 times out of 9 to deliveries outside off stump, leading to easy catches in the slip cordon.Also See: 2025 Champions Trophy Missing the opening Test due to the birth of his child, the Indian captain had the strangest of tours, sitting out of the final Test amid retirement speculation. He struggled, scoring just 31 runs in five innings at an average of 6.20. His form and leadership came under scrutiny. His performance marked the lowest average for any touring captain in a Test series in Australia. As captain too, not only did he lack imagination, Rohit made decisions that lacked clarity.Pant had an inconsistent series. His aggressive batting was both an asset and a liability, with some reckless shots drawing criticism. Pant struggled to convert promising starts into significant scores throughout the series. His 61 off 33 balls in the Sydney Test was a standout knock, but he couldn't convert it into a matchwinning one.In his debut series, Reddy scored 298 runs at an average of 37.25, including a historic century at the MCG. His bowling was less effective, yielding only five wickets. Reddy's success positioned him as a long-term prospect for the Indian Test team. The series also showed his ability to adapt and deliver under pressure.Also See: ICC Champions Trophy Schedule 2025 Siraj took 20 wickets, the second highest for India, but was often expensive, averaging over 31. He faced criticism for leaking runs at times, especially his 0-122 in Melbourne which raised alarm. Siraj bowled a total of 157.1 overs, the most by any Indian bowler in the series, over Bumrah's 151.2. Despite his wickets tally, Siraj's performance fluctuated throughout the series.Gill's performance was disappointing, scoring only 93 runs at an average of 18.60. At the No. 3 position, he failed to capitalize on starts. His batting seemed to be confused and lacking in intent.Jadeja's contribution was below expectations, with 135 runs at an average of 27 and only four wickets in three Tests. His overall performance affected the team's balance during the tour. While his batting at times provided lower-order resistance, his lack of wicket-taking ability was notable.Ashwin played only one Test, taking a single wicket before announcing his retirement from international cricket after the third Test in Brisbane. His retirement appeared contentious and sparked discussions about the timing.In three matches, Washington scored 114 runs at an average of 22.80 and took three wickets at an average of 38.66, failing to make a significant impact in either department. While he showcased moments of resilience with the bat, particularly in Melbourne, his overall impact was limited by underutilization as a bowler.Playing in the final Test in Sydney, Krishna impressed with six wickets at an average of 17.83, stepping up in Bumrah's absence and showcasing potential for the future. His performance at the SCG not only demonstrated his potential, but also highlighted lack of clarity in team selection, as what could have been had he been included earlier.Akash Deep's moment under the sun in the BGT came with the bat instead of his bowling. He scored an invaluable 31 in a critical situation during the first innings of the Brisbane Test, the knock helping India avoid a follow-on, and draw the Test. With the ball, he showed promise but failed to get wickets.Rana's BGT sojourn was a tale of two contrasting outings: an impressive debut in Perth followed by a significant drop in form thereafter. His future prospects will depend on how he addresses his inconsistencies and adapts to the pressures of international cricket.Padikkal played just the first Test in Perth. He was dismissed for a duck in the first innings after facing 23 balls, but in the second essay he stitched together a decent partnership with Jaiswal. He showed promise during the 25-run stay at the crease.Jurel showed promise during the ‘A' series before the BGT, which led to him being picked for the Perth Test. But knocks of 11 & 1 didn't help his cause and he wasn't a part of the playing XI in the remaining Tests.Gambhir did his reputation no favour on the tour, his first big test as coach. His team selection, strategies, decisions and dressing room unity all came under intense scrutiny as the team faltered. Critics questioned the effectiveness of the coaching staff, particularly in addressing the team's batting inconsistencies and tactical nous.",Jasprit Bumrah named Player of the Series. Yashasvi Jaiswal named highest run- scorer. Virat Kohli's form below par. Rohit Sharma's captaincy under scrutiny. Mohammed Siraj's bowling was less effective.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117039741,imgsize-45668,width-400,resizemode-4/117039741.jpg"

2024:

Joburg Super Kings are one of the three teams who have been into the playoffs for both the SA20 seasons so far. They finished semi-finalists in the inaugural edition and were knocked out in Qualifier 2 last year. Continuing under Faf du Plessis ' leadership, they hope to at least make it one better this time around.Towards that objective, Joburg Super Kings have invested in bringing in experience to take that extra step. “We’ve had some great signings in Jonny Bairstow Devon Conway and Matheesha Pathirana . Those three guys and (Tabraiz) Shamsi are four proper cricket players. All in all our squad is very balanced,” Du Plessis said on the eve of the tournament, which gets going on 9 January.For JSK, the biggest hurdle coming into the season was the string of injuries to bowlers. Gerald Coetzee had been ruled out of the international summer due to a groin injury. He had also missed the second season for the franchise with a pelvic inflammation. This time, Faf and rest of the franchise would be hoping he remains injury free.The franchise have already lost seamers Nandre Burger and Lizaad Williams to injury.In the spin bowling department, JSK have Tabraiz Shamsi and Moeen who are certains for the playing XI. Then Imran Tahir or Lizaad Williams can come in as the conditions.With the bowling weakened, the batting will have plenty to do to give the bowlers something to defend. The onus of that will lie on Bairstow, Conway, Faf, Leus du Plooy, Donovan Ferreira, who AB de Villiers has dubbed as the ""next South African ABD"", Moeen Ali and David Wiese.Three in four of Joburg Super Kings' new faces to SA20 are experienced cricketers. Barring Rookie all-rounder JP King, the franchise have brought to their midst England wicketkeeper-batter Bairstow, New Zealand opener Conway and Sri Lanka's Pathirana (the team's Wildcard).At the auction, Joburg Super Kings spent R175,000 each on allrounders Wihan Lubbe and Evan Jones. Both Lubbe and Jones were with Paarl Royals in the past.Super Kings also signed New Zealand allrounder Doug Bracewell for his base price of R175,000. Bracewell had been with the franchise last season, coming in as a replacement player for Romario Shepherd.Moeen Ali, Jonny Bairstow, Doug Bracewell, Gerald Coetzee, Devon Conway, Faf du Plessis, Leus du Plooy, Donovan Ferreira, Beuran Hendricks, Evan Jones, JP King, Wihan Lubbe, Sibonelo Makhanya, Matheesha Pathirana, Tabraiz Shamsi, Imran Tahir, Maheesh Theekshana, Hardus Viljoen, David WieseSemi-finalsQualifier 2","Joburg Super Kings are one of the three teams who have been into the playoffs for both the SA20 seasons so far.

NEW DELHI: Virat Kohli 's woeful run with the bat in Test cricket continues to be a talking point in the cricketing circles with his former Royal Challengers Bengaluru teammate Faf du Plessis throwing his weight behind his potential return to form.In the five Tests of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy, Kohli scored just 190 runs at an average of 23.75 and was dismissed eight times chasing deliveries outside the off-stump.Since 2020, Kohli's Test numbers reveal a stark decline. In 39 matches, he has scored 2,028 runs at an average of 30.72, including just three centuries, suggesting that Kohli is going through his career's all-time lowest phase.Du Plessis believes Kohli, known for his immense drive and past successes, will instinctively know how to navigate through tough phases and return to form when the time is right.""Yeah, it's different for every player. Every player needs to answer that question himself. I remember when that time was for me. I just knew that, certainly from a Test cricket perspective for me, I didn't have that same hunger and drive for Test cricket anymore, and I felt that that stage, certainly for me, was a good time to let new guys come in and also step into the T20 world. So I wanted to do that at a stage where I still felt like I was on top of my game,"" du Plessis said while addressing press conference for SA20 Season 3's Captain's Day.""That's very, very personal. No one can speak to you about when that time is. As a player, you'll know. I know someone like him. He's super, super motivated. He's gone through it all before, so you'll know exactly what to do to get through it,"" he added.Du Plessis expressed his displeasure with the ICC reportedly considering the introduction of a two-tier Test system.""No, I think we need the game to be healthy,"" Du Plessis said.""We saw over the last few years the value that was put on Test cricket by Australia, England and India making sure that there were 4-5 Test series.""When you look at the other teams, there are two Test matches here and there and playing six Test matches a season. I do not think that is healthy for the game,"" he offered.""As long as we can look at Test cricket as (being) important, you just look at all the Test matches that took place over the last few weeks, some incredible matches have been played,"" Du Plessis noted.You were part of DC this time. How excited are you for this new role? (4:23)Du Plessis, who led RCB to the playoffs in the previous IPL season, will be donning the Delhi Capitals jersey in IPL 2025 and is excited to be a part of his 14th IPL season.""Yeah, new franchise. Obviously excited just to be part of the IPL. I think it will be my 14th season in the IPL, so I'm really proud of that. And just, as with any team and everywhere I go, is to give my best and make sure I put in some really good performances,"" he said.","Former Royal Challengers Bengaluru teammate Faf du Plessis believes Virat Kohli will return to form when the time is right.

Young Indian player Abhimanyu Easwaran ’s cricketing journey is a tale of grit and patience. Despite a stellar domestic record, including consistent performances for Bengal and India A, the domestic doyen continues to wait for his maiden India cap.Known for his composure and ability to play long innings, Easwaran, who has been grinding it out in domestic cricket for over a decade, got his share of luck after being part of the Indian squad on quite a few occasions but luck eluded him every time, as he remained on the sidelines.In January 2021, Easwaran was first named as one of five standby players in India's Test squad for the home series against England. A few months later, in May 2021, he was again named as one of four standby players for India’s Test squad for ICC World Test Championship (WTC) final and the subsequent away series against England.Two and a half years later, Easwaran was named as a replacement for the injured Ruturaj Gaikwad during the two-Test series against South Africa in December 2023. He was once again called up, this time as the third opener for the five-Test Border-Gavaskar Trophy (BGT) against Australia.The 29-year-old has been a prolific run-scorer in domestic cricket, amassing over 7,600 first-class runs in 101 matches. With an impressive average of nearly 50, his tally includes 27 centuries and 29 fifties, reflecting his consistency and ability to deliver big innings at the domestic level.Easwaran got the BGT call at the perfect time as he has scored five centuries in his last six first-class matches, showcasing remarkable consistency, including an unbeaten double ton against Bihar in Ranji Trophy His latest hundred came against Uttar Pradesh in the Ranji Trophy before leaving for India A tour to Australia. Prior to that, he hammered a commanding 191 against Mumbai in the Irani Cup, further cementing his reputation as a big-match player. Earlier in the season, Easwaran displayed his prowess with two fine century knocks in the Duleep Trophy.In Rohit Sharma's absence for the first Test, Easwaran seemed a natural choice to step in as opener. However, his below-par performances against Australia A proved costly. In the two A-games, Easwaran managed scores of just 7, 12, 0, and 17, leading to the team management overlooking him for the Border-Gavaskar Trophy.Instead, Easwaran’s India A teammate, Devdutt Padikkal , who impressed with 151 runs in four innings, was preferred and included in the final XI. This decision highlighted the management's lack of faith in Easwaran, despite his domestic heroics, leaving him on the sidelines once again.With runs in abundance under his belt, Easwaran's exclusion raises questions about selection policies and competition in Indian cricket. For a player who epitomises perseverance, the wait for an Indian cap seems perpetual, leaving fans and critics wondering what more he must do to make the cut in the playing XI.","Ahimanyu Easwaran is a prolific run-scorer in domestic cricket.

By the time the 2026 FIFA World Cup begins, Brazil star Neymar will have reached 34 years of age; and while he is confident of the team's qualification, the veteran striker is also hopeful of making it to the squad for his last appearance in the prestigious tournament.In an interview with the CNN, Neymar said he won't leave any stone unturned to ensure that he is part of the team.""I know this will be my last World Cup, my last shot, my last chance and I will do everything I can to play in it,"" said Neymar.He has not made an international appearance for more than a year.Brazil's performance in the South American World Cup qualifiers has been below expectations so far, currently positioned fifth among 10 competing nations after completing 12 out of 18 rounds. The top six teams in the end qualify for the tournament.""I have a lot of faith in the team, in the players who are emerging, who are young,"" he said. ""We're not in a position where we would like to be. I think together we can achieve something very big. We have a year, a year-and-a-half to work, to do the right things to reach the World Cup.""Following his knee injury during Brazil's defeat to Uruguay in October 2023, Neymar underwent surgery that kept him sidelined for twelve months. He had participated in Brazil's initial four qualifying matches before the setback.Neymar made a brief comeback with Saudi Arabian side Al Hilal, appearing twice between October and November, but subsequently suffered a hamstring strain. Since then, he has remained inactive.""I want to be there (at the World Cup); I'm going to try to do my best, to work very hard so that I can be with the Brazilian team,"" he said.During the interview, Neymar also mentioned he won't rule out playing beside former Barcelona team-mates Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez at US club Inter Miami.""Obviously, playing again with Messi and Suarez would be incredible,"" Neymar, who also played with Messi at Paris Saint-Germain, said at an award ceremony in Dubai.""They are my friends. We still speak to each other. It would be interesting to revive this trio,"" he added.""I'm happy in Saudi Arabia, but who knows? Football is full of surprises.""The expanded Club World Cup scheduled for June will feature both Al Hilal and Miami, where he could face off against Messi and Suarez on American soil.",Neymar says he will do everything he can to make it to the 2026 World Cup. He has not played for Brazil for more than a year due to a knee injury. The 34-year-old says he won't rule out playing with Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117070319,imgsize-41160,width-400,resizemode-4/117070319.jpg"

Barcelona 's Dani Olmo and Pau Victor have received temporary permission to play for the club. This comes after the Spanish sports council ( CSD ) granted precautionary approval on Wednesday.The financially challenged club couldn't register the players before the deadline at the end of last year. Olmo and Victor had been given temporary licenses when they joined in the summer.The CSD's decision allows Olmo and Victor to be selected by Barcelona. This is a temporary measure until a final ruling is made in the club's case against La Liga and the Spanish football federation (RFEF). These organizations had prevented the club from renewing the players' registrations.“This measure, which is provisional until the appeal filed by the club and the aforementioned players is finally resolved, suspends (La Liga and RFEF's decision), and the cancellation of the sports licenses of the aforementioned players,”“It also maintains the validity of said licenses until this appeal is finally resolved.”Despite this development, Olmo and Victor were expected to miss Barcelona's Spanish Super Cup semi-final against Athletic Bilbao in Saudi Arabia on Wednesday.If Barcelona qualified for the final, the players would be eligible to play on Sunday. They would also be available for subsequent Barcelona matches until the CSD's final decision.The players missed Barcelona's Copa del Rey round of 32 victory against Barbastro on Saturday. Barcelona presented their case to the CSD on Tuesday.The players were initially registered short-term. Barcelona utilized a financial loophole following defender Andreas Christensen 's injury.Barcelona lost two court cases last week attempting to secure new licenses for the pair. Following these setbacks, the club sold VIP boxes at their new Spotify Camp Nou stadium, which is still under construction. The reported €100 million ($104 million) sale aimed to allow the club to comply with La Liga's financial fair play rules.Despite the deal being finalized and paperwork submitted, it occurred three days after the league's deadline.La Liga confirmed that Barcelona now meets the financial requirements. However, Olmo and Victor's licenses had expired. Regulations prevent players from ""obtaining another license at the same club to which they were already linked"" during a single season.Barcelona argues that the rule is outdated. The club contends that since they now have the necessary funds and the transfer window is open, they should be permitted to register the players. This is according to Spanish media reports.",Barcelona's Dani Olmo and Pau Victor have received temporary permission to play for the club.

Sharp Yamal

Young starlets Gavi and Lamine Yamal fired Barcelona , without Dani Olmo after his licence to play was revoked, into the Spanish Super Cup final with a 2-0 win against Athletic Bilbao on Wednesday.Spanish playmaker Olmo was cleared to play again on a temporary basis before the game but the decision came too late for him or Pau Victor, in the same position, to feature against Copa del Rey winners Athletic.Gavi put Barcelona ahead from close range after 17 minutes and teenage winger Yamal netted the second early after the break.Spanish and European champions Real Madrid face cup runners-up Mallorca on Thursday in the second semi-final in Saudi Arabia, where the competition has been held for the past few years.""Athletic are a very physical team that make you run a lot, we suffered above all towards the end, but we were able to play well and we're very happy,"" Yamal told Movistar.The winger said Olmo and Victor were pleased to be allowed to play once more.""In the end you're nervous when you can't play and when you get news like that, you're very happy,"" added Yamal.Barca coach Hansi Flick hailed the decision from Spain's national sports council regarding Olmo and Victor.""The whole club is very happy for this right decision,"" said Flick, hoping to win his first silverware at the helm of Barca.""We wanted to show we are a team and we win also for them.""Barcelona, who qualified as La Liga runners-up, started brightly and Raphinha volleyed over from a fine Jules Kounde cross and forced Unai Simon into a good save with a free-kick.It was no surprise when the Catalans broke the deadlock with Alejandro Balde cutting the ball back for Gavi, playing in Olmo's attacking midfield role, to turn home for his first goal since suffering a severe knee injury last season.The 20-year-old pointed at an imaginary watch in his celebration, a nod to Olmo who regularly produces the same gesture after scoring.At the other end Inaki Williams dallied on the ball too long as Athletic's best attacking move of the first half broke down.Yamal, returning after an ankle problem, should have added Barcelona's second after Raphinha's shot was saved but the 17-year-old miscued an attempted lob.Wojciech Szczesny, on his second start in goal for Barcelona, made a good save to keep Inaki Williams at bay before the break.Barcelona doubled their lead early in the second half when Gavi slipped in Yamal who finished with aplomb.Veteran Polish forward Robert Lewandowski spurned a fine chance to add the third, firing off-target when well placed.Athletic coach Ernesto Valverde, who was sacked as Barcelona boss after a defeat at the same stadium in 2020, brought on Nico Williams to try and turn the game around.The Spain international, heavily linked with Barcelona in the summer, was not fit enough to start, but made a positive impact from the bench.The winger set up Oscar de Marcos to strike but the Athletic defender had strayed just offside and the goal was ruled out.Inaki Williams also had a goal ruled out for offside after Frenkie De Jong's poor back-pass took a slight deflection off Alvaro Djalo on its way to the Ghana international.""It's a shame given all the effort... but we have good things ahead of us and we have to continue,"" said Inaki Williams.Barcelona were able to book their place in Sunday's final, in which Olmo will be allowed to feature.""We don't care (who we face in the final), it will be hard and we want to win it, which is the important thing, and go back home with the trophy,"" said Yamal.",Barcelona beat Athletic Bilbao 2-0 in the Spanish Super Cup semi-final.

London: Lucas Bergvall condemned Liverpool to only their second defeat this season as the teenager's late strike earned Tottenham a controversial 1-0 win in the League Cup semi-final first leg on Wednesday.Bergvall struck with just four minutes left in north London, but Liverpool boss Arne Slot was furious that the Swede was still on the pitch to score his first goal for Tottenham.Already on a yellow card, the 18-year-old had escaped a second booking moments earlier after tripping Kostas Tsimikas.Tsimikas was out of position after the tackle when Bergvall scored from an attack that started on the left flank vacated by the Liverpool defender.Tottenham's victory was a welcome tonic for Rodrigo Bentancur , who was taken to hospital after suffering a worrying injury.Bentancur stooped to head a corner in the seventh minute and stayed on the ground after falling unchallenged.His team-mates showed immediate concern and play was stopped as Bentancur received medical attention for nine minutes.The 27-year-old was given oxygen through a mask during the treatment as a hush fell on the capacity crowd.At half-time, Tottenham moved to ease fears over Uruguay star Bentancur, who only recently returned from a seven-game ban for using a racial slur about team-mate Son Heung-min.""We can confirm Rodrigo is conscious, talking and will go to hospital for further checks,"" the club said in a statement on X during the half-time interval.Responding to criticism of Tottenham's spluttering form and his attacking tactics, Tottenham boss Ange Postecoglou claimed earlier this term that he always wins a trophy in his second season.The under-fire Australian could do with backing up that boast given Tottenham's poor form in the Premier League.Tottenham last won a trophy when they lifted the League Cup in 2008 and the competition is shaping up as an opportunity to end that long silverware drought.Liverpool won the League Cup last season in what proved to be Jurgen Klopp's last trophy.Slot has taken Liverpool to the top of the Premier League and the Champions League since replacing Klopp, making this a rare flop from the Reds under the Dutchman.It was Liverpool's first defeat in 24 games in all competitions since a 1-0 loss to Nottingham Forest in the league in September.That was the only other loss endured by Slot this season and, following Sunday's disappointing 2-2 draw with lowly Manchester United, he is facing the first test of his prolonged honeymoon period on Merseyside.The second leg at Anfield on February 6 will decide who advances to the final.Newcastle won 2-0 at Arsenal in the first leg of the other semi-final on Tuesday.Postecoglou had handed a debut to goalkeeper Antonin Kinsky, who replaced injured duo Guglielmo Vicario and Fraser Forster after signing from Slavia Prague in a £12 million ($14 million) deal at the weekend.With Liverpool well below their best, the 21-year-old Czech wasn't forced into action until late in the first half when he held on to Alexis Mac Allister's header.Slot grew frustrated with Liverpool's miscues, gesticulating at his backroom staff after Cody Gakpo's shot was saved by Kinsky.There was more angst for Slot when keeper Alisson Becker turned an ambitious turn inside his own area, allowing Bergvall to steal possession and start an attack that ended with Pedro Porro chipping just wide.Slot sent on Trent Alexander-Arnold and he almost made an instant impact with a shot that was cleared off the line by Radu Dragusin.Darwin Nunez, another of Slot's substitutes, was denied by a fine save from Kinsky.Bergvall escaped a red card before snatching his priceless winner in the 86th minute.Dominic Solanke showed impressive strength and determination to hold off Ibrahima Konate, laying a pass into the path of Bergvall, who slammed low past Alisson.Kinsky made a superb stop to repel Nunez's agile back-flick in stoppage-time as Postecoglou finally enjoyed a night to savour.",Tottenham beat Liverpool 1-0 in the first leg of the League Cup semi-final. Lucas Bergvall scored the only goal of the game in the 86th minute.

West Ham dismissed Julen Lopetegui on Wednesday following a brief 22-match stint, with Graham Potter , previously of Chelsea, anticipated to take the helm at the London Stadium.The club sits 14th in the Premier League , maintaining a seven-point cushion above the relegation places, having secured only six victories in 20 league fixtures under the Spanish manager's leadership.A decisive 4-1 defeat to Manchester City on Saturday prompted the club's leadership to take action.""The first half of the 2024/25 season has not aligned with the club's ambitions and the club has therefore taken action in line with its objectives,"" West Ham announced officially.They added: ""The board would like to thank Julen and his staff for their hard work during their time with the Hammers and wish them every success for the future.""West Ham invested substantially during the summer transfer window, allocating approximately £125 million on acquisitions including Max Kilman, Crysencio Summerville and Niclas Fullkrug.Lopetegui's tenure was marked by poor results, winning just once in his initial six league matches and enduring significant defeats, including a 5-2 loss to Arsenal and a 5-0 defeat against Liverpool at home.The 58-year-old, with previous experience at Real Madrid and Spain, succeeded David Moyes in May, following the Scot's departure after his second stint with the London club.Moyes had guided West Ham to European competition for three successive seasons, culminating in the 2023 Europa Conference League victory, the club's first major honour in 43 years.Upon his appointment, Lopetegui, who had previously managed Wolves, expressed his enthusiasm, stating he had alternative options but was ""very happy that West Ham chose me because I chose West Ham too"".The club's search for Lopetegui's successor reportedly included discussions with former AC Milan manager Paulo Fonseca and previous Paris St-Germain head coach Christophe Galtier.Potter, 49, has been inactive since departing Chelsea in April 2023, where he achieved 12 victories in 31 matches during his abbreviated tenure of a five-year contract.His managerial journey began at Swedish side Ostersund, followed by productive periods at Swansea and Brighton before his Chelsea appointment.West Ham's next fixture is an FA Cup third round match against Aston Villa on Friday.Lopetegui becomes the fifth Premier League manager dismissed this season, following Erik ten Hag, Steve Cooper, Gary O'Neil and Russell Martin.","West Ham dismiss Julen Lopetegui after just 22 matches in charge of the club.

The League Cup organisers have mocked Mikel Arteta after the Arsenal manager blamed the ""tricky"" match ball for his team's loss against Newcastle.Newcastle United secured a significant advantage towards reaching the Wembley final with a 2-0 victory in the semi-final first leg at the Emirates on Tuesday, with Alexander Isak and Anthony Gordon finding the net.Despite Arsenal's 23 attempts at goal, only three were on target, with notable misses from Gabriel Martinelli and Kai Havertz. The competition uses Puma balls, whilst the Premier League employs Nike balls.Arteta commented on the ball's behaviour, stating: ""We kicked a lot of balls over the bar. It's tricky. This ball flies a lot. It's just very different to the Premier League ball and we have to adapt to that. It flies different, and the grip is very different as well.""Arsenal had previously scored 11 goals in their three League Cup matches this season before this semi-final first leg.The Carabao Cup 's social media account, with approximately 600,000 followers, shared Arteta's post-match comments about the ball alongside a meme featuring US rapper 50 Cent displaying a bewildered expression, seemingly criticising the Arsenal manager's remarks.The victorious team from this tie, concluding at St James' Park on February 5, will face either Tottenham or Liverpool at Wembley.Arteta faces mounting expectations to secure his second trophy as Arsenal's manager, following his FA Cup triumph in his inaugural season.Arsenal, currently second in the Premier League, are set to host Manchester United in the FA Cup third round on Sunday.",Arsenal lost 2-0 to Newcastle in the League Cup semi-final first leg on Tuesday.

Referees in firing line: AIFF wants India to embrace tech,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/top-stories/referees-in-firing-line-aiff-wants-india-to-embrace-tech/articleshow/117039653.cms,"Representational photo

PANAJI: The All India Football Federation ( AIFF ) has introduced a merit table for referees with ‘Key Match Incidents’ being measured by independent assessors at the end of every round in the Indian Super League and I-League. The merit table will be used to promote and relegate referees from the top two divisions.If a referee has blundered, he would be taken off “to protect the integrity of the competition,” according to Trevor Kettle, the former Premier League assistant referee who’s now the federation’s chief refereeing officer (CRO).Match officials, he pointed out, have been removed from panels this season because they’ve made clear blunders.Among other categories, the KMIs include denial of an obvious goal-scoring opportunity, disputed goal — awarded and disallowed — penalties, offside judgment and technical area removal.“Do referees make mistakes, yes, they do,” Kettle told TOI over a video call. “I am as disappointed as anybody when I see a referee make an error. We don’t want that to happen. Are we arrogant enough to say that we get everything right? No, we’re not. But errors occur.”According to the AIFF CRO, in his first year (2022-23), the key match incident accuracy increased to around 80% from the 72% that tentative data had previously suggested.Last year, it was around 83-84, and at the end of the season touched 85.“This year, currently in the ISL, it’s around 82% and in the I-League, since we are doing it for the first time this season (and there are less cameras), it’s just above 85%.“To make the transition, to jump from 80-85% into the high 90s, there is only one solution. That’s exactly why other countries, top leagues have introduced technology, because you can rectify the decision at the game, not retrospectively. I want as much information available to match officials to get the decisions right on the day, not retrospectively (watching on video and accessing performance),” said Kettle. That brings the video assistant referee (VAR) system into focus.“If you bring technology into the game, you will get more and more accurate decisions,” said Kettle, who has officiated in over 800 professional games and at every English club ground. “It provides referees more confidence to make decisions. As football has exponentially expanded, commercially too, in the last two decades, you have more and more cameras coming into the field of play. The more cameras that you have, the more chance of proving a referee wrong.”",The All India Football Federation has introduced a merit table for referees. ‘Key Match Incidents’ being measured by independent assessors at the end of every round in the Indian Super League and I-League.

Players want shorter seasons, play with the same ball through the year, faster/slower courts, is tennis in danger of being homogenized?

Would a Premier Tour then divide the sport?

Top players in the men’s and women’s draws —Jannik Sinner and Iga Swiatek—have failed drug tests in 2024, how would that affect the Aus Open?

Novak Djokovic is chasing a 25th major title at the Australian Open, what do you think has worked for him in Melbourne?

What do you make of the Murray-Djokovic partnership?

How important is it for a Grand Slam to have its own player?

Tune in to watch the Australian Open 2025 from 12th January 2025, 5:30 AM IST onwards live on Sony Sports Ten 1, Sony Sports Ten 2 & Sony Sports Ten 5 channels.

Craig Tiley—CEO, Tennis Australia and Tournament Director, Australian Open —believes a Premier Tour would give the multi-tiered sport order and breathing space.The idea of a Premier Tour – based on a breakaway formula, that appears to cater to elite players — has been the talking point in tennis for the last couple of years.In an exclusive chat with TOI, ahead of the first Grand Slam of the year, Tiley also warned not to underestimate the 10-time champion 37-year-old Novak Djokovic , while calling the Serb’s partnership with Andy Murray a promoter’s dream.Excerpts:It's a good question. The Grand Slams are of the view that having fans understand when a player starts their journey and where they go and ensuring there's a really good off-season for the players, is important. The seven governing bodies in tennis (ITF, ATP, WTA and the four Grand Slam tournaments) are in ongoing conversations, how do you create a Premium Tour that consists of major events throughout the year. Many of them already exist, but how do you bind them together? Elevate the premium side with the Grand Slams and Masters events potentially, that creates a strong narrative. For example from January to October, and then having a couple of months off for off-season.The challenge we have in tennis is that it's hard for the fans to understand why a player is playing here, what it means to their world-ranking or their race… It's not as clear-cut as we would like it to be. There’s an opportunity for the sport to be more coordinated in the delivery of that product to the fans. It also depends on the number of players you're going to count in the professional ecosystem, having a thousand (players) potentially could be too many, so that has to be looked at.There's a lot of debate around that. Nothing is ever going to be designed that's detrimental to the playing cohort, it's really important that you have a large ecosystem. It basically comes down to a few things and one of them is that players need to make more money and more players need to make a bigger living. So we've got to create an ecosystem that is commercially viable and strong. It's on us as administrators to create an environment where that can happen.The drug related issues are for those that are involved in it and (those) authorities. There's a rigorous program that is rolled out on a daily basis across the sport and I'm not going to make a comment on that because that's for others to comment on and manage.I've been around him for a long time, have a great deal of respect for him and his journey, coming from a war-torn country. It's a remarkable story. He's very comfortable playing here in Australia, the surface suits his game, he's got a big fan base here, probably the biggest outside of his home country, a lot of people love him and come to watch him. Some athletes just click at some places, I think you could say Rafa (Nadal) did that at Roland Garros, maybe Roger (Federer) did that in many places and also at Wimbledon.We should never underestimate the amount of preparation that goes into (his campaign) and the details he takes care of. I think if I'm an athlete and I'm playing against Novak I would lose before I've started, just watching the routine that he goes through because it's unbelievable. He deserves all those victories and I wouldn't be surprised if he gets to number 25. He's got a young mind and he can get around the courts well.It's a promoter's dream — two (contemporary) Number Ones, one coaching the other. When I first heard about that, before it was announced, I thought it was fantastic for Novak, fantastic for Andy. Andy loves the game so much he will never leave tennis, that's why he's a bright shining star for our game. And of course Novak with his success, these guys are mates who played against each other. They’ve had great matches here at the Australian Open and I'm looking forward to seeing where Andy is going to help Novak.It's going to be followed a lot. I think every court that Novak practices on is going to be absolutely packed because they'll get to see Andy and Novak, listening carefully and watching carefully what Andy's going to tell Novak. It's going to be a great time for both of them and the game. It brings another level of interest.It creates a lot of excitement nationally, because young kids can have an aspiration, they see it with their own eyes and want to be like that person. That's important from an emotional point of view, tennis wise the event has become such a global event that our fans in Australia and around the world love to experience the event. Part of my role is also running tennis in the country, so having Australians do well into the second week and even winning, like in the case of Ashleigh Barty, is great for the game. I don't think any Grand Slam nation will deny the fact that having a local hero is great promotional value for the sport, but it's not always critical to the success of the event.","Craig Tiley is CEO, Tennis Australia and Tournament Director, Australian Open.

NEW DELHI: Australian tennis player Nick Kyrgios, known for his polarizing personality, has withdrawn from an exhibition match against Novak Djokovic due to an abdominal strain.This development raises concerns about his fitness for the upcoming Australian Open , which commences this weekend.Kyrgios made his return to tennis last week in Brisbane after an 18-month hiatus, during which he underwent knee surgery and wrist reconstruction.However, his comeback was short-lived as he exited in the first round after a gruelling three-set encounter with the rising French star Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard.

Cameron Norrie avoided disqualification and apologised after his tossed racket accidentally hit a spectator during an ATP Tour tournament in Auckland on Tuesday.Britain's Norrie, who was born in Auckland, was down match point against Argentina's Facundo Diaz Acosta when he lightly tossed his racket into the air. The racket struck a woman in a court-side box, but she was not injured.The chair umpire issued Norrie a warning, and he subsequently lost the match 2-6, 3-6 in the first round of the tournament. Last year, he had reached the final in Auckland.“I wasn’t meaning to do that but it’s still not ideal to be doing that and I’ve never done something like that,"" Norrie said. (The spectator) ""was laughing and I just said ‘so sorry, I didn’t mean to do that.’ And she said ‘yeah, I’m completely OK.’""That was not a big deal. But as we saw with some other players, you can easily be defaulted if it catches them in the wrong spot or they’re not looking or something.""I was not meaning to do that and it is completely not me to do something like that. I apologized very quickly and I want to apologise in general. I’m not happy with how I behaved.”In related incidents, Novak Djokovic was disqualified from the 2020 US Open for accidentally hitting a linesperson with a ball.At the 2023 French Open, Miyu Kato and Aldila Sutjiadi were also defaulted from the women’s doubles after a ball hit by Kato struck a ball girl.Additionally, Australian player Marc Polmans was defaulted from the final round of qualifying at the Shanghai Masters in 2023 for hitting a ball into the face of the chair umpire.","Cameron Norrie apologises after his tossed racket accidentally hit a spectator during an ATP Tour tournament in Auckland on Tuesday.

Will Sinner and Swiatek's positive tests take the sheen off the Australian Open?

Nick Kyrgios has had a go at Sinner and Swiatek on social media, even hoping to play Sinner...

Would you say Djokovic has a few more years left in tennis?

What motivates Djokovic?

How do you like Alcaraz's chances at Melbourne Park?

How does on-court coaching help someone as gifted as Carlos Alcaraz?

Who would you pick as the surprise factor?

What are Sinner's chances of defending his title?

With the transition from the Big Three era, how do you envision the future of men's tennis?

What is the future of doubles?

The 22-time Grand Slam doubles and mixed-doubles champion Todd Woodbridge dismissed the effect of Jannik Sinner and Iga Swiatek's positive tests on the Australian Open, starting on Sunday in Melbourne Park.The 53-year-old believes the cases were handled swiftly and will not weigh on the first major of the year. In an interview with select media, Woodbridge liked Carlos Alcaraz's chances while warning that Novak Djokovic is motivated to extend his lead at the top of the game.Definitely not! One of the great positives to come out of those cases is the fact that our sport is dealing with them properly. It means our testing is rigid, we have a 52-week policy that players must abide by. The next part is the process they went through.There was negativity about Simona Halep's process, how long it took, why it took so long and then our processes were fixed. So you've had two of the best players in the world that had an issue, they have both been able to prove what those issues were. And remember, you are innocent until proven guilty.They were able to show cause and effect and the process was fast. It has allowed everybody to get back to normal. That is important because they're not going to be the last. There will be other players that are going to trip over or some that may deliberately cheat. There are going to be issues, but I am pleased with the process.As a former athlete, I would never want to put more pressure on myself, that's probably putting more pressure on his own self to have to perform. If that ( Sinner vs Kyrgios ) were to play out, it would be interesting viewing.Nick has been out of the game for a long time (almost two years), which is going to be a difficult thing for him. I hope he hasn't set his expectations too high because it's going to take time to get back to the level that he was playing at before that.He's certainly one of the favourites for the Australian Open. He comes in as little more of an underdog (this year) because he didn't do the best at Grand Slams in 2024, but he was in the Wimbledon final, he won the Olympics, he is knocking on the door. He's fit and motivated. While you've got the motivation, you don't stop. There's at least another two years in Novak, particularly if he has a strong start to this season in Australia.The thing that motivates him is winning Grand Slam titles, it's about extending his lead. No one is ever going to catch him. What drives an athlete like him is having somebody push him and that was Andy Murray Roger Federer , Rafa (Nadal) they challenged him. Now Alcaraz and Sinner have come along and I think he's got a bit to prove to them, that I'm not willing to give it all up yet. That's his motivating factor right now.This is his best chance yet. He didn't get to Australia after winning his first major (US Open, 2022), was injured. Then last year, he didn't have his coach Juan Carlos Ferrero, and he looked tactically unsure and didn't play his best. This time, he has done a proper pre-season. Alcaraz is so dangerous. He's the most enjoyable player to watch since Federer. He has the flair and finesse of Roger, fitness and movement of Novak and then the Spanish determination that Rafa had. He is probably my pick for the Australian Open based on the time he's had to prep. It will be some feat if he was able to win the Australian Open and then have all four majors at such a young age.As he's getting older he's starting to accumulate his own experiences to know what to do at the right time. One of the joys of watching him is that he has so many options, that's why it's so important for him. I'm hoping it's going to be a long career as he learns how to discipline his play because sometimes he plays a lot of drop shots and it's fancy and he can let an opponent back into a match.As you get older, you get more disciplined, you understand how to get that done. That was what Roger started to do very well when he was at his absolute prime, would just demolish players with the right shots at the right time. Carlos is still really putting all that together, he's still got a lot to improve on.I'm waiting for Mirra Andreeva to step up. She has this incredible allcourt game that's modern. It resembles Martina Hingis at her best, but with that modern power.Very high. He is the best player in the world right now. He's the defending champion, but that for me is going to be the one thing he's going to have to learn to live with. He hasn't defended a Grand Slam title yet in his career, this is his first.Everyone was worried. Will the quality drop? And I seriously didn't think that the younger generation would be able to play well this quickly, but they have. Some of their plays are quite extraordinary.They are stronger, more physically trained through technology and data. All of that has made the next generation better. There's still room for this generation to add nuance to their game, add that feel, soft hands, volleys, playing in different parts of the court.It depends on how much the governing bodies continue to make it important. When you see it as an Olympic sport, it remains something everyone focuses upon. When you look at the Grand Slams, it's important, huge events where they need content on all courts, not just Centre Court. So, I don't see it ever leaving the game. And throw in the team competitions like Billie Jean King Cup, Davis Cup , United Cup, they become crucial. Let's be honest, not every player will end up like a Sinner or an Alcaraz or a Sabalenka.(Tune in to watch the Australian Open 2025 from January 12, 2025, 5:30 AM IST onwards live on Sony Sports Ten 1, 2 & 5 channels)",Todd Woodbridge says Jannik Sinner and Iga Swiatek's positive tests will not have an impact on the Australian Open.

NEW DELHI: Tilak Varma is part of a bunch of cricketers known for their high-octane strokeplay. In reality, he brings calm in a batting lineup always high on adrenaline. Only 23, Tilak is the anchor that keeps the high-flying superstars of Indian cricket grounded.However, the stars were offered a real-ity check by the newbies of world cricket, USA, in their opening game last Saturday.With all eyes now on the India-Pakistan match in Colombo on Sunday, Thursday’s game against minnows Namibia will be all about tuning up for that big game. With the decks having been cleared for that contest, planning for that game has regained priority.On Wednesday, Tilak spoke about how the Namibia game here was important to implement the learnings from the slip-ups against the USA. He emphasised how the Indian team has revived the anchor role, with him at the centre, in this tournament, probably after surviving the proverbial banana-peel encounter in Mumbai last week.“The middle overs are very important and you need a settled batter there. I think I should take the game deep.If we are chasing, I like to finish the game. We don’t have a shortage of power-hitters, everyone can hit till No. 8. So, it becomes important that someone anchors in the middle,” Tilak said on Wednesday. “One or two batters have to play that role. I take that pressure on myself and the others can attack.”Tilak is willing to do the dirty job, play the second fiddle rather than chase the glamour of being the hit-man. He doesn’t discount the variables in a game of cricket, the pitch and match circumstances. Contrary to talks that the team management had harped on flexibility and only the openers had settled bat-ting positions, the team has zeroed in on him and Suryakumar to provide stability.“Like I said, we have enough power-hitters. But we feel overs 6-16 is where T20 games are won because teams will hit out anyway at the top and in the death. Having a stable No. 3 and No. 4 is very important,” he said.Like he showed in the tricky chase in the high-pressure Asia Cup final against Pakistan in Dubai in Sept, Tilak is a man on a mission. His game is flamboyant but not flashy. Having recovered from an abdominal surgery just in time for his maiden World Cup may have just spurred him on.","Tilak Varma is the anchor that keeps the high-flying superstars of Indian cricket grounded.

T20 World Cup | Sahibzada Farhan on India vs Pakistan matches: 'Not one-sided'

Poll What do you think is India's biggest advantage going into the match? Experience of the players Strong batting lineup Strategic planning Team cohesion

NEW DELHI: India batter Tilak Varma has said the team is fully charged for the high-pressure ICC T20 World Cup clash against arch-rivals Pakistan on February 15, adding that the squad has already entered “match zone” after uncertainty around the fixture finally ended.Pakistan had earlier threatened to boycott the marquee encounter in Colombo before taking a U-turn, clearing the path for one of cricket’s most anticipated contests. Speaking on the eve of India’s Namibia clash, Tilak admitted the confirmation has only heightened excitement within the camp.“To be honest, we are very excited to play. We got to know that the match is going to take place the day before. We are ready to play. We are watching all the teams. We are watching the bowlers and the batsmen,” Tilak said.“All the players and team members are ready to play. Now, we are in the match zone. The planning will start,” he added, signalling that India’s preparations for the Colombo showdown are already underway.Assistant coach Ryan ten Doeschate had earlier highlighted Pakistan’s potential advantage of being based in Sri Lanka for a longer period, but Tilak stressed that India’s approach remains methodical.“We are going one by one in every match… we have video analysis, technology, and we will see how the wicket is behaving. Everyone has different shots, and we will decide which bowlers to target,” he explained.Despite his naturally attacking style, Tilak said he is ready to adapt his role depending on the match situation. Reflecting on India’s opening win over the USA, where wickets fell in a cluster, he revealed that head coach Gautam Gambhir has encouraged flexibility in the batting order.“Gautam bhai has asked us to play cautiously if wickets fall quickly. Suryakumar bhai and I can anchor the innings if needed,” he noted.Tilak, who recently returned from injury, expressed satisfaction at being back on the world stage. “Happy that I am back in the World Cup side. The only aim is to help the team win the cup,” he said.",Tilak Varma says India squad is fully charged for T20 World Cup clash against Pakistan.

RCA in doldrums

JAIPUR: What should be a stable home base for Rajasthan Royals has instead become a source of ongoing uncertainty. The Jaipur-based franchise remains undecided on hosting the majority of its home games at Sawai Mansingh (SMS) Stadium and is awaiting clearance from senior IPL and BCCI officials over unresolved safety, infrastructure and administrative concerns at the venue.“Royals, while in principle agreeing to play matches at SMS Stadium, have written to the IPL chairman, BCCI secretary and the CEO seeking clarification on the status of the Jaipur stadium’s lack of fail-safe measures,” a source said.The SMS Stadium underwent renovation in 2006 but since then the venue has seen no upgrades, leaving it feeling some-what frozen in time despite its continued use for IPL matches. Concerns persist over whether its infrastructure and safety measures, including evacuation norms and operational readiness, are fully adequate to handle the large crowds expected for modern IPL games. The venue last hosted a T20I on Nov 17, 2021 and it has been over a decade since its last ODI on Oct 16, 2013.It has been learnt that Royals have high-lighted critical lapses in the stadium infrastructure. “From civic work to emergency evacuation, there exists serious issues of public safety and Royals have communicated everything to the RSSC, BCCI and IPL governing council,” the source added.Since June last year, the franchise has repeatedly raised concerns with the RSSC, BCCI and IPL authorities regarding public safety — particularly life safety, structural integrity and statutory compliance — across all engineering and operational areas in accordance with prevailing regulatory codes and standards.With the RCA’s continued defunct status, Royals through its letter to BCCI have requested the governing body for guidance and their approval. The last time the Royals were forced to move their home games out of Jaipur was during the 2014 and 2015 IPL seasons. This was driven by RCA’s notorious governance volatility, internal friction, and leadership deadlocks.The governance of the RCA has been in a downward spiral, operating without an elected body under a series of ad hoc committees for nearly two years. While the IPL governing council permitted Jaipur to host games in previous years, it issued a stern caveat: if the RCA fails to hold elections, the city will lose its IPL 2026 fixtures.Despite the ultimatum, the RCA remains mired in internal conflict. The leadership vacuum has also stalled the development of the RCA’s own stadium, slated to be the third-largest in the world. The previous regime under Vaibhav Gehlot secured a Rs 100 cr grant from the BCCI in 2023, but construction was abandoned following his resignation and the ad hoc takeover. A dedicated cricket stadium remains the only long-term solution, as the multipurpose SMS Stadium is an outdated property.","Jaipur-based franchise remains undecided on hosting the majority of its home games at Sawai Mansingh (SMS) Stadium.

South Africa emerged victorious in a double super over thriller as Afghanistan came up agonisingly short of a famous victory after their T20 World Cup clash ended in a tie on Wednesday.Afghanistan were 187 all out after South Africa scored 187-6 in the Group D encounter in Ahmedabad.The teams were tied again after a breathless first super over saw them both score 18, before South Africa won off the final ball of a heart-thumping second sudden-death showdown.After South Africa bludgeoned 23 from their second super over and Afghanistan lost a wicket off the second ball of theirs, Rahmanullah Gurbaz was left needing four sixes off four balls for an unlikely victory.Gurbaz sensationally launched Keshav Maharaj into the crowd three times with some huge blows.A wide off the fifth ball meant Afghanistan still needed six to win but now a four would send it, incredibly, to a third super over.With nerves jangling and pulses racing, the left-arm spinner held his nerve to bowl a wide yorker that Gurbaz smacked into the grateful hands of David Miller at point as he looked to hit a boundary.Afghanistan -- semi-finalists in 2024 -- also lost to the group's other heavyweights, New Zealand, leaving their chances of advancing as one of the top two teams all but over.One of the most memorable tied matches occurred in Durban in 2007, during the inaugural T20 World Cup. India faced Pakistan in a tense group stage encounter. Both teams scored 141, leading to a thrilling bowl-out, which India won 3-0, setting the stage for their eventual tournament victory.In 2012, the Pallekele International Cricket Stadium in Sri Lanka witnessed two tied matches in quick succession. The first was between Sri Lanka and New Zealand. Both teams managed 174 runs in their allotted 20 overs. The match went to a Super Over, where Sri Lanka emerged victorious, thanks to their superior batting.Just days later, the same venue saw another tie, this time between New Zealand and the West Indies. Both teams scored 139 runs. The Super Over that followed was equally dramatic, with New Zealand managing to edge out the West Indies, adding another thrilling chapter to the history of tied matches.Fast forward to 2024, and the trend of exciting tied matches continued. In Bridgetown, Namibia and Oman played out a tense encounter. Both teams scored 109 runs, leading to a Super Over. Namibia held their nerve to secure a victory, showcasing the unpredictable nature of T20 cricket.Another addition to this illustrious list came in Dallas in 2024. The United States faced Pakistan in a Group A match. Pakistan, the 2009 champions, recovered from a poor start to post 159-7. The United States matched this with a thrilling chase, scoring 14 runs in the final over to finish on 159-3, pushing the match into a Super Over. In the Super Over, the United States set Pakistan a target of 19 runs. Saurabh Netravalkar's excellent bowling restricted Pakistan to 13-1, securing a historic victory for the United States and marking one of the biggest upsets in T20 World Cup history.The most recent addition to this list was Afghanistan vs South Africa match on Wednesday, which Proteas won in the second Super Over.",Afghanistan were 187 all out after South Africa scored 187-6 in the Group D encounter in Ahmedabad.

AHMEDABAD: South Africa survived pure T20 mayhem here, edging Afghanistan only after two Super Overs and only after Rahmanullah Gurbaz , the man who al-most stole the show, picked out a fielder off the last legal delivery.In a match that swung so violently it felt rigged by fate, South Africa escaped after the scores were tied at 187 all, then 17 runs all in the first Super Over before South Africa finally prevailed, scoring 23 to Afghanistan’s 19 in the second.Put in to bat, South Africa built a plat-form that looked match winning. Ryan Rickelton’s 61 off 28 was a blistering statement of intent and Quinton de Kock’s 59 off 41 provided the polish as the left-hand pair tore through Afghanistan’s attack in a stand worth 114.South Africa finished at 187/6, helped by late hits from David Miller (20* off 15) and Marco Jansen (16 off 7) even as Af-ghanistan clawed back through Azmatul-lah Omarzai (3/41) and Rashid Khan (2/28).Afghanistan’s chase was as dramatic as it was chaotic. Gurbaz played the lead role, striking 84 off 42 to keep dragging the game back from the brink. When wickets fell all around him, the pursuit became part calculation, part stubborn refusal to surrender.Then came the over that should have ended it — and instead detonated the match. Afghanistan began the last over needing 13 with one wicket in hand, the sort of equation that usually closes a contest. But Kagiso Rabada overstepped twice, cracking open a door Afghanistan had no right to still be pushing at.Noor Ahmad launched a crucial six and suddenly the stadium was roaring for a heist. Yet, in the rush of the mo-ment, Afghanistan’s running betrayed them: a desperate second run ended with a run-out at the non-striker’s end and the regulation 20 overs finished locked at 187 apiece. The first Super Over was a punch and counterpunch. Omarzai and Gurbaz smashed 17 off Lungi Ngidi, only for South Africa to answer through Tristan Stubbs, who launched a last-ball six to force the unimaginable: a second Super Over.South Africa’s second Super Over was ruthless. They scored 23 without loss, with Miller and Stubbs clearing the ropes to set a target that felt absurd even by T20 standards. And still Afghanistan nearly aced it. Facing 24, Gurbaz stared the chal-lenge in the eye, striking three consecu-tive sixes until Afghanistan were one more swing, and a six, away from victory with one ball left. A boundary would have meant a third Super Over. Keshav Maha-raj fired it wide, angled away from the hitting arc and Gurbaz sliced it to Miller.It was heartbreak for Afghanistan and relief for South Africa. With the win, South Africa moved to four points from two games, level with New Zealand at the top of Group D, while Afghanistan slumped to two defeats. Their campaign could be effeectively over since they need more than just wins against UAE and Canada.","South Africa beat Afghanistan by two wickets in T20 World Cup match.

Sanju Samson headache for Team India | Is Ishan Kishan the right choice?

AHMEDABAD: Decisions taken with match-ups in mind can backfire, as it did for Afghanistan on Wednesday. In-stead of sending the in-form Rahmanullah Gurbaz to bat in the second Super Over, Afghanistan sent in Mohammad Nabi , trusting his striking abilities against spin bowling. The move failed spectacularly as Nabi not only consumed a dot but was dismissed off the second, leaving the hard-hitting Gurbaz with no room for error. Gurbaz obliged with three maximums but failed to execute the crucial fourth hit as left-arm spinner Keshav Maharaj hurled the delivery wide of his hitting arc.Asked why Nabi came out to bat at the start of the second Super Over, Afghanistan head coach Jonathan Trott said, “We saw that they’re going to bowl spinner Maharaj and Nabi is a good hitter of spin. We didn’t get it right with the call we made and Gurbaz was in good form. It’s one of those things.”Asked about the lessons from to be drawn from such close contests, Trott said, “As a coach, you’ve got to be very clear on what you do. What happens is, certainly when the game ends, there’s a lot of emotion and a lot of information. Sometimes it works out. Sometimes it doesn’t. When you’re on the losing side of it, you think, ‘what if ?’ If it was the other way around, South Africa would be asking themselves the same questions.“Obviously these types of losses can hurt and sting for a while. I think it’s important we look at those areas that we did really well in, but also areas that we could improve on,” he added.",Afghanistan lost to South Africa in the second T20 World Cup match on Wednesday.

NEW DELHI: Left-arm spinner Gudakesh Motie broke through England’s middle order as the West Indies secured a 30-run win in their T20 World Cup match in Mumbai on Wednesday.West Indies posted 196 for 6, built around Sherfane Rutherford’s unbeaten 76, with support from Jason Holder in the final overs.England were bowled out for 166 in 19 overs in reply. They began the chase quickly, but Motie, who mixes left-arm orthodox and wrist spin, dismissed Tom Banton, Jacob Bethell and captain Harry Brook in a spell of 3 for 33.England slipped from 85 for 2 in the eighth over to 131 for 5 in the 14th when Brook was out for 17. Sam Curran tried to keep the chase alive with 43 not out from 30 balls but ran out of partners.The result gave West Indies their second win in two matches and moved them to the top of Group C in the race for the Super Eights.England started strongly as Phil Salt took 24 runs from Jason Holder’s first over, hitting two sixes and three fours to move the score to 31 without loss after two overs.

Soham in action during a match.

Raised in a sports-loving family, Soham Bhagawati’s journey into football began at an early age. Born in Guwahati and raised in Dubai, he grew up surrounded by sporting influence: his father was a tennis player and his grandfather was a footballer. This unwavering family support helped turn a childhood passion into a serious career pursuit. Now based in Spain, the young footballer is steadily building his path towards a potential India debut.Soham moved to Spain about two and a half years ago to improve his football skills and gain exposure at a higher level. At the same time, he is continuing his studies and pursuing a degree in sports management, which helps him learn more about the sport both on and off the field.Soham was called up for trials with the India Under-19 team in 2020, a significant milestone in his career. He considers wearing the Indian jersey a major achievement and a moment of pride, further motivating him to push himself.The 22-year-old currently plays for Terrassa FC, representing the club’s B team in the second division of Catalonia, while the senior team competes in Spain’s fourth division.According to him, football in Spain has helped him grow both technically and mentally, and the competitive environment has been a valuable learning experience.Soham named Brazilian star Neymar as his early inspiration. However, with time and a deeper understanding of the game, he feels that every player brings something different to it. Today, rather than idolising one individual, Soham believes there is something to learn from everyone and focuses on improving by taking lessons from all players he watches and plays alongside.From Indian football, Soham calls Sunil Chhetri “the king” and draws inspiration from his achievements and leadership. He likes FC Barcelona and Argentina’s Boca Juniors, and he dreams of one day representing a club of similar stature through hard work and dedication.He hopes to represent his favourite ISL club, NorthEast United FC, one day. For now, however, his focus is on gaining experience and improving his game.According to Soham, the difference between players from India and Spain is not talent but exposure, which sets them apart. He, though, feels the level of young Indian footballers is steadily improving.""India has talented players and improving facilities, especially with ISL clubs now offering strong infrastructure. However, football does not receive the same level of investment and attention as other sports, which limits growth. Exposure to competitive environments is still the biggest gap,"" Soham told TimesofIndia.com in an exclusive interview.Soham emphasised how crucial the ISL is for Indian football. He said it not only provides young players with much-needed exposure and professional experience but also keeps fans connected to the sport.""The ISL is the main league people associate with football in India in recent years. Without it, the sport loses visibility and structure. Even though the format and wages have changed, it’s good that players are back on the field — playing matches is what matters most for footballers,"" he added.Soham’s short-term goal is to break into his club’s first team, while his long-term aim is to play at a higher professional level in Spain. Representing India at the senior level remains a clear dream — one he believes is achievable through consistent hard work, dedication and belief in his abilities.“Representing India at the senior level is everyone’s dream. For me, it could happen very soon if I keep working hard towards it. Let’s see — it takes effort, but if it happens, it will be a proud moment,” Soham added.Soham is optimistic about the future of Indian football. He believes that, with proper focus and commitment, India has the potential to qualify for the FIFA World Cup.“We already have top-quality players like Sandesh Jhingan, Lallianzuala Chhangte and many more. If we focus well and give everything to it, I believe we can achieve it in the next few years,” he said.Beyond football, Soham is deeply spiritual and credits his faith for keeping him grounded.“I always pray every day and look up to God because He is the one giving us opportunities. We’re truly blessed to have everything we have. There will be bad times, but they always pass. The key is to stay positive, focus on the right things, and always be happy and smile,” he said.",Soham Bhagawati was born in Guwahati and raised in Dubai.

Poll What do you think about FanCode's decision to partner with Sony Sports Network for ISL coverage? Excellent choice, strong market presence. Good, but could have considered other options. Disappointed, preferred a different network. No opinion.

Just over a week after FanCode, owned by Dream Sports, secured the broadcast rights for the truncated 2025–26 Indian Super League (ISL) season, it has sub-licensed the linear TV coverage to Culver Max Entertainment, also known as Sony Pictures Network India (SPNI).Sony Sports Network had attended the pre-bid conference but opted against making a final bid. FanCode eventually acquired the broadcast rights for Rs 8.62 crore.FanCode, which does not have a TV channel of its own, had entered into immediate conversations with multiple providers to showcase India's top division. Besides Sony Sports Network, Zee, DD Sports and regional providers in Kerala and Kolkata were the other considerations.However, the decision to go with Sony Sports was reached because they have an already established strong market base, while Zee is still finding its footing since re-entering the sports broadcast space last year. DD Sports was also probed as an option.While a verbal deal was reached between FanCode and Sony Sports Network, the paperwork and final agreement is in the closing stages at the time of writing.The contribution from Sony Sports will go to the All India Football Federation (AIFF), who are organising the league this season, and will be shared among the ISL clubs.Since acquiring the ISL broadcast rights, FanCode has announced separate structures for the fans to watch the ISL. There's a season pass for Rs 299, a team pass for Rs 149 and a match pass for Rs 25.With FanCode getting the media rights during the bidding process, KPS Studios will handle the world-feed production, acquired at a cost of Rs 5.22 crore.The 14-club league begins on February 14 with defending champions Mohun Bagan Super Giant taking on Kerala Blasters.","FanCode has sub-licensed the TV coverage of the 2025-26 ISL season to Sony Sports Network.

It’s white and cold! Cole Palmer covered his ears with his black-gloved hands after his customary ‘brrr’ celebration. Stepping up in Chelsea’s allwhite gear, he had planted the opening penalty against Wolves in the right corner last Saturday before breaking into the familiar pose, and an unfamiliar one.Outside noise? It has been a season interrupted with injuries, and it’s easy for doubts to creep in. There are rumours of ‘homesickness’; for the Manchester boy, who had sharpened his skills at City, and now linked to childhood love United, there was that unsettled feeling too.“Just people talking rubbish,” Palmer told The Times Of India in an interaction facilitated by JioStar. “Honestly it doesn’t bother me.”Letting his boots do the talking, he became the first player in Premier League history to register three 1st-half trebles.His immediate Insta post after delivering the message at Molineux, was captioned “Just enjoy.” Perhaps, it was a note to himself, as he makes sense of a stop-start injury-hit campaign. His words are defiant, though. “No, it doesn’t shake me. Of course I want to perform well, but if things get tough, it doesn’t really affect my confidence too much.”Cole processes praise and criticism in much the same way: “The same people who talk bad about you one minute will call you the best thing after you score. It doesn’t bother me.”That emotional equilibrium has been there for a while. Still only 23, he seems like an old soul amidst the uncertainty of constant shuffle at the heart of Stamford Bridge. He traces that calmness back home. “I think it comes from my dad,” he said. “From a young age, he taught me not to get too high or too low, no matter what.”Despite stepping up to the big league from the City production line, he got his one-way ticket to West London in the autumn of 2023. “I always knew I had the ability. I just needed a platform to show it,” the boy from Wythenshawe chose Chelsea to further his pro-levels of football education.The no-fuss No. 10 has so far collected 51 goals at his present club. There are World Cup ambitions too. But for now, the England international with a grandfather from St Kitts, is dealing with the vagaries of a sporting career.As Liam Rosenior’s Chelsea, in fifth place, host Leeds United in the EPL tonight, Cole finds himself in the starting XI in less than half the games this season, scoring 8 goals in 17 games. “This is something new to me,” Palmer shared with his club website. “I’ve never been injured before. I’ve not played a game this season fully fit. I’ve been overthinking it too.”It’s about managing fitness and expectations. Scoring hat-tricks will certainly amp up the noise, though. Cole Palmer is “just a normal guy like everyone else,” he tells you. But then, he can’t lead a normal life.(CATCH ALL THE ACTION FROM THE PREMIER LEAGUE, LIVE & EXCLUSIVE ON STAR SPORTS NETWORK AND JIOHOTSTAR)",Cole Palmer is the first player in Premier League history to register three 1st- half trebles.

NEW DELHI: Mexican authorities have announced that robot dogs will be deployed to assist police operations during the 2026 FIFA World Cup, as part of enhanced security measures for the tournament.The four-legged robotic units are built to venture into high-risk zones and relay live video footage to law enforcement teams, allowing officers to assess situations remotely before moving in during World Cup-related operations.The month-long global event, scheduled to run from June 11 to July 19, will be jointly hosted by Mexico, the United States and Canada.The robot dogs were purchased by the Guadalupe city council — located in the Monterrey metropolitan region, one of the World Cup host areas — at a cost of 2.5 million pesos (approximately $145,000). Monterrey is set to stage matches at BBVA Stadium, which will be temporarily renamed Estadio Monterrey for the tournament.Footage released by local authorities shows one of the robots navigating an abandoned structure, walking up staircases with measured precision while transmitting real-time visuals back to police officers following at a distance.During the demonstration, the robotic canine confronts an armed individual and uses a built-in loudspeaker to instruct him to drop his weapon, showcasing its role in frontline assessment and de-escalation.Guadalupe mayor Hector Garcia said the robots are intended to assist officers during initial interventions, reducing direct exposure to potential threats. “The objective is to protect the physical integrity of our police,” he said, adding that the machines will be deployed whenever disturbances or confrontations arise.Estadio Monterrey is scheduled to host four World Cup matches during the tournament.","Mexican authorities have announced that robot dogs will be deployed to assist police during the 2026 FIFA World Cup.

- Guehi booed -

LIVERPOOL: Erling Haaland's stoppage-time penalty earned Manchester City a dramatic 2-1 win at Liverpool on Sunday to reduce Arsenal's lead at the top of the Premier League back to six points. City were heading for defeat at Anfield with six minutes to go before Bernardo Silva cancelled out Dominik Szoboszlai's stunning free-kick to spark an incredible finale.Haaland put City in front from the spot before the visitors had another goal ruled out and Szoboszlai was sent off in the same incident after a VAR review.Victory was City's first away to Liverpool in front of a crowd since 2003 and reapplies some pressure to Arsenal's quest for a first title in 22 years.""I feel the whole team knew before the game, if we lost it then the title race was probably over,"" said Silva. ""We felt like we needed to win.""Defeat delivered another blow to Liverpool's hopes of Champions League football next season.The defending champions remain down in sixth and four points adrift of the top five.These two clubs have combined to win the last eight Premier League titles, but both showed the flaws which have opened the door for Arsenal to potentially end their long wait to be crowned champions of England once again.Haaland has scored just once from open play in his last 13 games and an uncharacteristic lack of confidence from the Norwegian showed with the best chance of the first half inside the opening two minutes.Silva's clever pass split the Liverpool defence, but Haaland's shot lacked conviction under pressure from Milos Kerkez, and Alisson Becker was able to save low to his left.Second half slumps have been a consistent feature of City's season and the visitors again faded in the second period until a late flurry saved their title challenge.""Second half we pressed really high and played good football,"" said Liverpool boss Arne Slot. ""We have improved so much, but we need to improve the results.""Marc Guehi was relentlessly booed after his proposed move to Liverpool from Crystal Palace broke down on transfer deadline day in September.City took advantage to swoop in last month when they lost two key centre-backs to injury.Guehi was fortunate to escape with just a yellow card when he dragged down Mo Salah just outside the box in a decision that infuriated Slot.But it was City who were left fuming at the award of the free-kick which led to the opener when Ryan Gravenberch went down under minimal contact.Szoboszlai scored the only goal with an outrageous free-kick when Arsenal visited Anfield in August and produced another stunning strike which clipped the inside of the post before finding the net.However, the Hungarian went from hero to villain when City levelled six minutes from time.Szoboszlai played Silva onside as he slid in to volley home Haaland's header for City's first second-half goal in the Premier League this year.Alisson then wiped out Matheus Nunes to concede a penalty and Haaland kept his cool from the spot to put City in front.Pep Guardiola's men then needed a stunning save from Gianluigi Donnarumma to tip behind Alexis Mac Allister's deflected shot.With Alisson remaining forward from the resulting corner, the Liverpool goal was open when Rayan Cherki took aim from the halfway line to roll the ball into an empty net.However, Haaland and Szoboszlai's grappling as the ball trickled towards the goal saw the strike ruled out, with a free-kick awarded to City instead, and the Liverpool player given his marching orders.",Erling Haaland's stoppage-time penalty earned Manchester City a dramatic 2-1 win at Liverpool on Sunday.

On Instagram, she shared photos from the weekend, including a quiet kiss on the field at Levi’s Stadium, and a message that carried both faith and resolve.""Not how we wanted it to end but still thanking God for this incredible season❤️,"" she wrote. ""We are blessed to be surrounded by such an amazing group of people, who made this season what it was."" Then came the line that hinted at perspective beyond one night. ""This is only the beginning!!""The Patriots quarterback had reason to hold his head high despite the final score. At 23, Maye completed 72 percent of his passes in the regular season for 4,394 yards and 31 touchdowns, adding 421 rushing yards. He finished second in MVP voting, a remarkable leap in just his second year. The postseason proved harsher. Across four playoff games, he completed 58.3 percent of his throws, absorbed 21 sacks and turned the ball over 11 times. Seattle’s defense never let him settle in the Super Bowl.Yet the story around Maye stretches beyond the stat sheet. Ann Michael has grown into a public figure herself, building a TikTok following of more than half a million with her baking videos and game day posts.Her ""Bakemas"" series in December sparked a surge of new fans and led to an NBC Sports Boston feature. Some of her creations even reach the Patriots locker room. “The O-line is like my main recipient of my baked goods. Occasionally, they’ll write me a thank-you note,” she shared in a January 2026 video. “It’s so funny, it’s, like, ‘Just keep feeding us. We need to protect your husband, so we need to keep on the extra weight. If you need a bodyguard, we’ll be your bodyguard.’”Their partnership has been years in the making. Middle school sweethearts, they married in June 2025 after Maye capped his rookie season with a proposal. ""Getting married is one of the best decisions I've made in my life,"" Drake told reporters in February 2026. ""Good things happen when you get married, and I think that's the case so far in my life."" He has spoken just as warmly about her growing spotlight. ""She’s got her own little journey that’s been awesome. Being herself, that’s the best thing about her and what I love her for.""Sunday hurt. No one in New England will pretend otherwise. But if Ann Michael’s message revealed anything, it is that the Mayes see this loss as a chapter, not a verdict.","Drake Maye's wife, Ann Michael, shared photos from the Super Bowl.

Sam Darnold’s Super Bowl triumph and wedding plans: how Seattle’s QB reached this moment



Sam Darnold and the Seattle Seahawks did not waste a second soaking in their Super Bowl moment. Sam Darnold stood at the center of it all this week, Lombardi Trophy secured, confetti cleared, and a city roaring his name. Just days after Seattle handled the New England Patriots 29-13 in Super Bowl LX, the quarterback found himself balancing two celebrations at once. A championship in hand. A wedding a month away.Sunday felt controlled from the start. Darnold played clean football, finishing 19 of 38 for 202 yards and a touchdown. More importantly, he stayed mistake free while Seattle’s defense rattled rookie Drake Maye twice, one turnover turning into a fourth quarter touchdown that slammed the door shut. By the time the clock hit zero, Darnold had authored the calmest performance of his career on the biggest stage.Why does this title matter so much for Sam Darnold? Because of where he has been. At 28, he has worn the weight of being written off. He endured tough years with the New York Jets and Carolina Panthers. He backed up Brock Purdy in San Francisco during a Super Bowl run that ended in heartbreak. Last season, he revived his stock in Minnesota with 14 wins.Now he owns a ring in Seattle.How did he celebrate? First with family and fiancée Katie Hoofnagle on the field. Then with an ice cold no look beer catch in the locker room that quickly made the rounds online. Soon after, he and Super Bowl MVP Kenneth Walker took the traditional trip to Disneyland, where Darnold posed for photos with Hoofnagle and even rode the tea cups. By Wednesday, he was hoisting another drink at the parade, grinning as fans packed the streets.Even in the middle of the chaos, cameras caught him mentioning that his wedding is coming up “a month” from now. That next chapter feels just as meaningful.Hoofnagle, a former South Carolina soccer standout who started 67 games in college, met Darnold during his time with the 49ers. They got engaged in July after a beach proposal in Dana Point that she answered with an emphatic “YES!!!!” Since then, she has been front and center.After the Super Bowl, she shared her pride publicly: “And despite everything, you remained kind,” she wrote. “In moments where it would’ve been so easy to make excuses or put the blame on somebody else, you never wavered. Your patience, respect, discipline, and humility have continuously shone through, even on the hardest days of the journey.”She added, “It’s an honor and a privilege to share you with the world on Sundays, and I’m so grateful that you finally got your flowers on the biggest stage. As long as I’m alive, you’ll always have someone who is proud of you in everything that you do.”Darnold has said much the same about her. “The support [from] my girlfriend is unbelievable,” he told Us Weekly last year. “She’s great. She’s always been my biggest supporter. And I love her, and I thank her for that all the time.”A Super Bowl title. A wedding on the horizon. For a quarterback once doubted, this season feels earned, not gifted.",Sam Darnold and the Seattle Seahawks beat the New England Patriots 29-13 in Super Bowl LX.

Chloe Kim playfully calls out boyfriend Myles Garrett over unexpected Olympics mix-up



Chloe Kim (Getty Images and Instagram)

Chloe Kim wasted no time reminding the field why her name still carries weight in Olympic halfpipe. In her first qualifier at the Milano Cortina 2026 Winter Olympic Games, the two-time gold medalist posted a 90.25 on Wednesday, grabbing the top spot and setting the tone for Thursday’s final on February 12.The 25-year-old arrived in Italy with more than expectation on her shoulders. Just weeks ago, she was dealing with a torn labrum. Yet there she was, floating above the pipe with her usual control and clarity, riding as if the pain belonged to someone else. A third straight Olympic gold would make her the first snowboarder to achieve that feat. The stakes are real. So is the resolve.Kim’s 90.25 did not come with visible strain. She attacked the pipe with speed, linked her tricks cleanly, and landed with the poise of someone who has lived on this stage for a decade. That consistency explains why she has stayed at a world-class level for so long. Still, context matters. Competing at the Olympics is hard enough. Doing it while nursing a shoulder injury demands a different level of toughness.Close to the course, Myles Garrett watched through a camera lens instead of a face mask. The Cleveland Browns star flew to Italy shortly after winning the 2025 AP NFL Defensive Player of the Year award.There were no quarterbacks to chase here. Just one run to capture.“I got her whole run,” Garrett said, according to ESPN. “She’s amazing.”Garrett recently set the NFL single-season sack record, but in Italy he seemed comfortable playing the supporting role. As Kim eyes Thursday’s final, his confidence in her did not waver.“She’s going to do it,” Garrett said. “She’s the best.”After qualifying, social media lit up with photos of the couple near the course. Kim reposted one on her Instagram story February 11. In the image, she touches Garrett’s face mid-conversation. Her caption read, “me scolding him for not bringing the sunscreen I bought him 😂😂”.The moment was light. The mission is not. Kim has already built a legacy most riders would envy. Now she stands one final away from adding a chapter that could redefine Olympic snowboarding history.",Chloe Kim posted a 90.25 in her first qualifier at the Milano Cortina 2026 Winter Olympic Games.

Fans accuse Kayla Nicole of name-dropping Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift for publicity stunt,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/fans-accuse-kayla-nicole-of-name-dropping-travis-kelce-and-taylor-swift-for-publicity-stunt/articleshow/128207771.cms,"Kayla Nicole faced backlash after appearing in a Super Bowl commercial that referenced her status as an “ex” of an NFL player, with a pointed “Swiftly” punchline. Many fans accused her of reigniting ties to Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift to stay relevant. Critics questioned her motives, while supporters argued she was reclaiming the narrative on her terms.

Kayla Nicole sparks backlash after “ex-girlfriend” jab during Super Bowl ad

Kayla Nicole returned back into the Super Bowl limelight, but not as many thought. Almost 3 years after her split with Travis Kelce , she featured in a Super Bowl LX commercial that promptly sparked controversy on social media. It was an advertisement promoting the fantasy sports platform Sleeper but actually rekindled the old debates regarding her former relationship and its enduring social stigma.The advertisement had Nicole and Tiffany Haddish , as well as NBA player Ben Simmons. Nevertheless, the viewers were less interested in the product and more concerned with the way of the introduction of Nicole. Rather than highlighting her career or name, the ad leaned into her history, framing her in connection to a former NFL relationship. For many watching, that single creative decision overshadowed everything else.In the sketch, Nicole addressed the setup directly. “Simmons and Haddish promised me that they could put an end to this whole 'ex-girlfriend' fiasco quickly,"" Nicole said. Simmons responded, “That doesn't sound right,” before correcting himself with a pointed pause: “Swiftly.”The wordplay was brief but deliberate. Given Kelce’s current engagement to Taylor Swift , the timing felt calculated to some viewers. Within minutes of the ad airing, reactions flooded social platforms.""This is quite possible the most embarrassing thing I've ever seen. Bunch of losers,"" one user commented. Another wrote: ""This might be the most embarrassing commercial I've seen. This gal is clout chasing bunny burner. She needs help for her mental illness."" A third added, ""It's been 3 years, and you're still nothing more than the ex-girlfriend who can't keep a man or a job.""The backlash highlights a difficult balance. Nicole has previously expressed frustration about being reduced to someone’s former partner. Critics now argue that participating in a sketch built around that exact identity contradicts her stance. Supporters, however, see it differently. They suggest she leaned into the narrative to control it, even mock it, rather than run from it.Super Bowl commercials often aim for viral moments. The given one succeeded in doing so though not necessarily so. The internet unraveled one word and its meaning instead of concentrating on the brand message of Sleeper.In the case of Nicole, the problem is evident. The perception of the masses is obstinate. It is a shrewd move or some misstep depending upon who is observing and on what tale they will follow.","Kayla Nicole appeared in a Super Bowl commercial that referenced her status as an ""ex"" of an NFL player.

Tom Brady and Alix Earle dating rumors grow after Super Bowl weekend sightings

Tom Brady and Alix Earle are back in the headlines, and this time the footage is hard to ignore. The NFL legend and the TikTok star were seen dancing closely at a private Super Bowl party in San Francisco, setting off a fresh wave of dating speculation. In a short clip shared by Deuxmoi, Brady appears relaxed and engaged, leaning in as Earle speaks to him. His arm circles her waist. At one point, his hands drift lower, and he gently pulls her closer.That brief moment has fueled days of chatter. It did not help that both were already in town for the Super Bowl festivities, moving through the same high profile events while keeping a careful public distance. Separate red carpet appearances only seemed to deepen the curiosity.Tom Brady and Alix Earle dominated social feeds throughout the weekend. The video from the private party showed Brady in a long sleeve shirt and baseball cap, blending into the crowd. Earle wore a lace detailed minidress and held a drink as she wrapped an arm around him. Brady leaned closer, listening. The clip is grainy, but the body language is clear enough to spark debate.Page Six reported the pair were also in San Francisco ahead of the game between the Seattle Seahawks and New England Patriots.At the Madden Bowl red carpet, they posed separately. Earle chose a white minidress with a leather jacket. Brady opted for a jacket, dark cap and sunglasses. They were later seen at Michael Rubin’s Fanatics Super Bowl Party, another celebrity packed stop on the weekend circuit.Speculation around them first surfaced on New Year’s Eve in St. Barts, where they were reportedly seen getting cozy at a yacht party. Since then, every shared appearance has drawn scrutiny. Earle recently split from NFL player Braxton Berrios, who entered the league through the Patriots in 2018 during Brady’s tenure in New England. Brady, 48, has not publicly entered a serious relationship since his 2022 divorce from Gisele Bundchen after 13 years of marriage.The morning after the party, Earle posted a “Get Ready With Me” video before heading to Levi’s Stadium. “Let's get ready for the Super Bowl,” she told followers. “I didn't go to bed until 6 last night, but we are up and ready. Benito day!” The timing raised eyebrows. Fans quickly connected the dots.She added, “We have been having the best weekend ever. Everything has just been so much fun, like the party last night, there was this big dancefloor and everyone was dancing. I tried not to have too many drinks last night. I will say I have been very proud of myself for making new friends... I've been trying to tell myself recently that social anxiety fears me. It has been so much better being a little bit more carefree, going up and talking to people. ”Neither Brady nor Earle has addressed the rumors directly. For now, a short dance clip and a late night confession have kept the spotlight firmly on them.","Tom Brady and Alix Earle were seen dancing closely at a private Super Bowl party in San Francisco.

“Don’t feel as creatively fulfilled”: Hailee Steinfeld shares emotional update as she and Josh Allen get ready for their newborn,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/dont-feel-as-creatively-fulfilled-hailee-steinfeld-shares-emotional-update-as-she-and-josh-allen-get-ready-for-their-newborn/articleshow/128206983.cms,"Hailee Steinfeld addressed growing speculation about her future plans, admitting she often thinks about returning to music but feels less creatively fulfilled than before. While celebrating her film success, she is also preparing for a new chapter in her personal life. Steinfeld and husband Josh Allen are expecting their first baby, marking a major milestone.

Why Hailee Steinfeld feels different about music today

Hailee Steinfeld is not rushing back into the recording studio, but she is not closing the door either. After months of speculation about a possible music comeback, the multi hyphenate star addressed the chatter directly in her Beau Society newsletter. Fans have been wondering when the “Wrong Direction” singer might release new material. Her answer was thoughtful, honest, and far from a simple yes or no.At 29, Steinfeld stands at a different point in her career. She has balanced charting singles, blockbuster films, and now a major life transition. Rather than tease a dramatic return, she offered clarity. “While I have no plans to make music right at this exact moment, do I think about it? All the time,” Steinfeld said. “Music has always been a huge part of my life, and if it makes sense to get back in a studio, it’s an easy yes. ”Steinfeld admitted the industry itself has shifted. “But the music industry has changed quite a bit over the last few years. I don’t feel as creatively fulfilled by music as much as I used to.” That reflection hints at a deeper evolution. For many artists who began young, the business side can reshape the creative spark.Steinfeld appears aware of that tension.Her comments come during a strong season professionally. Her recent film Sinners made headlines at the 98th Academy Awards with an impressive 16 nominations. That success reinforces her standing in Hollywood, where she first earned acclaim as a teenager. Acting continues to offer creative satisfaction, even as music remains close to her heart.On a personal note, Steinfeld is preparing for motherhood. She is expecting her first child with Buffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen. The couple began dating in May 2023 after being spotted together in New York City. They later married in a private California ceremony on May 31, 2025. Life looks fuller now. Priorities shift.Still, Steinfeld’s love for songwriting has not faded. She even praised another artist’s approach, saying, “I love the way Charli xcx writes about this.” That admiration suggests she still listens closely to how peers navigate expression in a changing landscape.For fans hoping for new music, the message is patient optimism. There is no album announcement. No studio countdown. But there is openness. And sometimes, that is the first note before the next song begins.","Hailee Steinfeld is not rushing back into the recording studio, but she is not closing the door either.

Travis Kelce found himself reflecting on a chapter of his life that once felt larger than football. Sitting comfortably on Kylie Kelce’s “Not Gonna Lie” podcast, the Kansas City Chiefs star opened up about his 2016 reality dating experiment, Catching Kelce.The conversation was light, filled with laughter, but it carried a surprising dose of honesty. Instead of brushing off the show as a youthful misstep, Kelce acknowledged it directly and gave credit to someone who stood by him when cameras followed his every move and headlines questioned his choices.Laughing at the memory, Kelce thanked his sister in law directly. ""You supported me in my darkest of days, and I want to say thank you... Yes. Kylie, you came out to LA and supported me dating 50 women, one from each state..."" The tone was playful, but the appreciation felt real. Kylie had flown to Los Angeles during filming and even watched episodes with family, choosing support over judgment.Catching Kelce aired on E! in 2016 when Kelce was 26 and still building his NFL résumé. The concept was bold. One contestant from each state competed for his attention.He ultimately chose Maya Benberry, though the relationship ended months later in early 2017, as previously reported by entertainment outlets at the time.Kelce has never hidden his mixed feelings about the experience. In a 2023 interview on Bussin' With The Boys, he described the show as ""the worst thing I ever did"". That honesty has followed him. Rather than erase the moment, he frames it as growth. A lesson learned in public.After the show, Kelce entered a long term relationship with Kayla Nicole, which lasted more than five years and overlapped with some of the biggest milestones of his career. They separated in 2022. Today, Kelce’s life looks very different. He is a Super Bowl champion, media personality, and part of one of the most talked about relationships in sports and entertainment alongside Taylor Swift.Kylie recently shared on NBC’s Today, ""We're so excited to celebrate, though. We can't wait..."" while keeping personal details private. That change says a lot. The man who used to look for love on reality TV now protects his private life on purpose.Kelce is still focused on football with the Chiefs, but this shows how choices made in the past still affect what people talk about now. He seems to be okay with owning every chapter, even the messy ones, with time and distance.","Travis Kelce appeared on Kylie Kelce's podcast and opened up about his reality dating experiment, Catching Kelce.

The set honored his island roots while spotlighting the house’s journey from short film to residency icon. The performance also brought renewed attention to a reported lawsuit from the home’s owner, adding deeper context to an already layered show.

Bad Bunny's Super Bowl Halftime Show was never going to be just a string of hits under bright lights. The Grammy winner used the Super Bowl LX stage on Feb. 8 to project Puerto Rico onto one of the world’s biggest platforms, folding history, pride and subtle political notes into a performance that felt personal as much as spectacular.He opened with “Tití Me Preguntó,” framed by a backdrop of sugar cane fields that echoed the landscape of his birthplace, Bayamón. Dancers in traditional pava straw hats surrounded him. It was a sharp visual choice. Even before the beat dropped, the message was clear. This was not a generic halftime set. It was a tribute.The heart of the Bad Bunny Super Bowl Halftime Show stood tall at midfield. La Casita returned, this time scaled for Levi’s Stadium in Santa Clara, California. After his recent Grammy wins and the release of his sixth studio album, Debí Tirar Más Fotos, Benito Antonio Martínez Ocasio brought the symbolic house from his Puerto Rican residency to the NFL stage.He sprinted up its steps to perform “Yo Perreo Sola,” turning the structure into both a set piece and a statement. Celebrities including Pedro Pascal , Cardi B, Jessica Alba, Karol G and Young Miko appeared inside, continuing a tradition from his 31-day “No Me Quiero Ir de Aquí” residency in San Juan, where invited guests watched the show from the house itself.The original home belongs to 84-year-old Román Carrasco Delgado in Humacao.It first appeared in the short film tied to Debí Tirar Más Fotos and later inspired the residency’s main stage. The replica, designed for large-scale production, kept the spirit but adapted the layout. According to The New York Times, designer Mayna Magruder Ortiz said parts of the structure, like the kitchen, preserved the original look while being reimagined as a functional bar for concertgoers.Still, the real property has drawn complications. Carrasco Delgado reportedly filed a $1 million lawsuit, claiming the use of his home caused him “emotional distress,” as a “large number of people” now visit daily to take photos and videos, transforming the quiet residence into a tourist stop.For the Super Bowl edition, production designer Julio Himede and creative director Harriet Cuddeford worked alongside Puerto Rican designer Mónica Monserrate to recreate the energy of the residency on football’s biggest night. The result felt deliberate. Every plank and paint color pointed back to the island.Bad Bunny did not just headline a halftime show. He built a bridge to Puerto Rico and invited millions to cross it.","Bad Bunny's Super Bowl LX halftime show featured a replica of a Puerto Rican home.

As culture clash narratives grew louder, audience numbers showed fans overwhelmingly chose the official performance.

Simu Liu’s viral reaction fuels halftime showdown

The Super Bowl halftime debate did not end when the lights dimmed. It spilled onto social media within minutes. Actor Simu Liu jumped into the firestorm after clips surfaced of an alternative halftime production promoted by Erika Kirk and backed by Turning Point USA. His response was blunt, emotional, and impossible to ignore.At the center of the controversy stood global music star Bad Bunny, whose official Super Bowl performance drew massive online engagement. Liu did not hold back when reacting to footage of the rival show, which featured Kid Rock. The contrast between the two productions, in his view, was stark and telling.Taking to X, Simu Liu wrote: “Am I f______ hallucinating or did they really organize a ‘halftime show’ with Kid Rock lip syncing to a crowd of seven people in an attempt to prove white dominance?!?!? Whatever; Bad Bunny was absolutely lit.""The post quickly became viral. His supporters were commended on his openness, and people who opposed him claimed that he was fuelling culture wars when it comes to sports and entertainment. Nevertheless, the figures were also another point in the talk.Videos of a Bad Bunny half-time show have gone viral and had over 53 million views on YouTube in a few days. By comparison, the Turning Point USA backed footage was close to 20 million.Those characters are important as they are the choice of viewers. The performances of their choice were actively sought, viewed, and exchanged by the fans.The controversy spread to the political arena. Bad Bunny was publicly condemned by President Donald Trump in his show, but online reaction indicated that viewers were more interested in the formal performance than the alternative one.The anger expressed by Liu appealed to the common mind that felt the competing event was more symbolic than showmanship. Others said there has never been a stage of art and politics that has not crossed at the super bowl stage. In any case, the answer was brought to the point of entertainment during breaks being much more than music. It has turned out to be a cultural hotspot.In the end, while critics debated ideology and intent, viewers made their preferences clear. They clicked. They shared. And in overwhelming numbers, they chose the main stage.","Bad Bunny’s Super Bowl halftime show dominated online engagement, drawing far more views than an alternative event promoted by Erika Kirk and backed by Turning Point USA.

Taylor Swift has made a decision about Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds, concerning her wedding to Taylor Swift



Travis Kelce might be growing concerned about Taylor Swift



Taylor Swift has always had a pretty strong group of high profile friends which she has introduced to all her partners, including her fiance Travis Kelce.While Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce have often been spotted going on double dates with her former best friend Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds, it seems the billionaire pop star has lost all aspects of loyalty in them.A few days ago, as per Rob Schuter, a source revealed that, “There’s been an emotional gap for a long time…”The source added, “Rebuilding trust doesn’t feel possible right now.”But that’s not all; apparently, Taylor Swift has also put a complete ban on Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds for her high profile wedding to Travis Kelce.As per Rob Schuter, the source added, “They are not invited. Period…Taylor wants a drama-free day, and she no longer trusts Blake or Ryan.”The source continued, “There’s no ‘will she or won’t she, she won’t.”Over the last year, there have been reports of Taylor Swift and It Ends With Us actress, Blake Lively, trying to reconnect and work on rebuilding their friendship.But, just a few weeks ago, Taylor Swift and Blake Lively’s private texts were leaked to the media.To make things worse for the billionaire pop star, even as her legal team claimed she had no involvement in the making of the blockbuster movie, It Ends With Us, the texts proved otherwise.In one text, Taylor Swift allegedly referred to actor and director Justin Baldoni as the “little b*tch”, while in another text, Blake Lively called him a “doofus director”.The leaked texts have sparked outrage among fans as many have trolled the billionaire pop star, Taylor Swift, for claiming to be innocent.However, neither Taylor Swift nor the popular actress, Blake Lively, has responded to the speculations as they remain distant from each other in public.While Taylor Swift deals with the legal chaos in her life, Travis Kelce is reportedly concerned about her emotional state, as per Daily Mail.At this point in time, there is a possibility that Taylor Swift might be called to court as a witness and Travis Kelce might not be comfortable with that idea.","Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce have often been spotted going on double dates with her former best friend Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds.

Possible outcome of a trade

Themay be heading toward a rebuild after trading James Harden to the Cleveland Cavaliers. The deal brought back Darius Garland and a 2026 second-round pick, a move that suggests the franchise is thinking beyond a short title window and focusing more on youth and financial flexibility.That shift placesat the center of the team’s next decision. Leonard is under contract through the 2026-27 season on a deal worth about $50.3 million in its final year. If the Clippers believe they are no longer contenders, they could trade him rather than risk losing him in free agency with no return.Darius Garland, 26, gives the Los Angeles Clippers a reliable point guard who can lead the offense for several years. Unlike Harden, he does not carry the same durability concerns and fits better with a roster that appears to be getting younger.The trade also signals that the team is no longer committed to building around an aging core. Instead, the focus looks to be on draft assets, cap control, and players who can grow with the franchise.Kawhi Leonard signed a three-year extension worth roughly $152 million. He will be 35 entering the final season of that deal, which makes his timeline different from a team that may not be ready to compete immediately.Any trade would likely follow a simple structure: the Clippers move Leonard for younger players, future picks, and possibly expiring contracts to reduce salary obligations.Typical expectations include:• Young players with upside• At least one first-round pick• Possible second-round picks or swap rights• One or two rotation players aged roughly 23-27• One or two first-round picks• Additional seconds or swap rights• Kawhi Leonard on an expiring contract• A minor contract if needed for salary matchingSuch a deal would help the Clippers avoid heavy luxury-tax pressure while giving another team a high-level player without a long-term commitment.• Salary flexibility after moving a $50M contract• More draft capital to add to picks projected between 2027 and 2032• A younger core built around Garland, John Collins, Derrick Jones Jr., and developing players• A chance to compete for another title• An opportunity to strengthen his value before free agency• A proven two-way wing when healthy• Immediate playoff help without a multi-year risk• Avoid relying on one expensive player• Trade Leonard while his value remains strong• Stay consistent with the direction set by the Harden trade• Loss of the team’s top player• Return packages may depend on unproven talent• Lower ceiling in the Western Conference in the short termMiami’s defensive identity makes Leonard a natural fit next to Bam Adebayo.Tyler Herro or Duncan Robinson, Nikola Jović, Kel’el Ware, a protected 2027 first, and a 2029 second.Golden State could use another defender and scorer on the wing to support Stephen Curry.Andrew Wiggins, Moses Moody, a 2028 first, and a 2030 second.Adding Leonard to a group that includes Harden and Garland would give Cleveland a strong core.: Evan Mobley or Isaac Okoro plus a 2027 first.A reunion is possible given the Spurs’ young roster and draft assets.: A young wing, a 2027 first, and a 2029 second.Leonard already has championship history in Toronto.: Immanuel Quickley, Chris Boucher, and a 2027 first, though Scottie Barnes would likely be unavailable.• Reduced competitiveness after the trade• The return may depend heavily on Leonard staying healthy elsewhere• A stronger collection of assets• Long-term cap flexibility• Ongoing injury concerns; Leonard played only about five games early in the 2025-26 season• The possibility he leaves after one year• A player capable of changing a playoff series• No long-term financial obligationLeonard was also selected to the 2026 All-Star Game at Intuit Dome, a reminder that he remains highly effective when available.If the Los Angeles Clippers move Leonard and receive young players plus multiple first-round picks, they could reshape the roster quickly while maintaining financial control. For a contender, acquiring him could raise the team from competitive to serious title threat.The downside is clear. If injuries limit his availability, the Clippers may not get full value, and the acquiring team could give up significant assets for little return.Also read: NBA trade rumors: Golden State Warriors could chase $11 million Miami Heat star for promising Jimmy Butler reunion ahead of postseason The decision will likely come down to timing. Keeping Leonard preserves star power but carries risk. Trading him would confirm a reset and shift the franchise toward its next phase.","Kawhi Leonard is under contract through the 2026-27 season on a deal worth about $50.3 million in its final year.

My final thoughts on this deal if it goes through

Theare hovering around the .500 mark in the Western Conference as of February 2026. They are still competitive but no longer dominate games the way they did during their championship years. With the playoff race tightening, the team is expected to look for steady role players who can strengthen the rotation without changing the core.. He was traded from Miami to Brooklyn in 2025 and waived by the Nets in early February 2026, which makes him an unrestricted free agent once he clears waivers. Jimmy Butler is already in Golden State after a multi-team deal in February 2025 that sent Andrew Wiggins to Miami. If the two reunite, it would happen in Golden State rather than Miami.Haywood Highsmith’s status means the Golden State Warriors do not need a traditional trade.Golden State could use a mid-level exception or a veteran minimum contract to sign him after waivers clear. No players would need to be moved.Another team could claim Highsmith and quickly trade him to the Warriors for a protected second-round pick or cash. Golden State would still avoid giving up important pieces.Highsmith is a 6’7” wing who can defend multiple positions, hit open threes, and move without the ball.During recent playoff runs with Miami, he played about 25-30 minutes per game while averaging roughly 10-12 points and 4-5 rebounds, shooting between 35% and 37% from three.He already knows Butler’s style, which could help with lineup adjustments. The Warriors rely on veterans such as Stephen Curry, Draymond Green, Al Horford, and Butler, along with younger guards like Brandin Podziemski, De’Anthony Melton, and Moses Moody. Highsmith would give them another dependable defender and a steady option late in games.Butler has often played well with disciplined role players. Highsmith understands defensive schemes and physical play, which could help lower Butler’s workload as he works back from a torn ACL ahead of the 2026-27 season.After being waived, joining a contender gives him immediate relevance and could improve his next contract. Golden State’s wing depth suggests he would compete for regular minutes rather than sit at the end of the bench.Miami already moved Highsmith’s contract and shifted toward a group led by Bam Adebayo, Andrew Wiggins, Norman Powell, and Tyler Herro. His next team does not affect their direction and keeps minutes open for younger wings such as Jaime Jaquez Jr.• Can guard positions two through four• Reliable outside shooting that helps spacing• Playoff experience and comfort in a role• Recently had meniscus surgery and may need time to regain form• Does not create much offense for himself or others• Could tighten an already competitive wing rotationAlso read: NBA trade rumors: New York Knicks could land $26 million Cleveland Cavaliers big man to support Eric Gordon trade; do they make a move? If Golden State signs Highsmith at a reasonable number, the risk is low. The team would add a dependable wing without giving up important assets. Butler would have a familiar teammate, Highsmith would join a competitive roster, and Miami would continue forward with its current group.",Haywood Highsmith is an unrestricted free agent once he clears waivers.

Who gains more?

Theare projected to pursue veteran forward Georges Niang through the 2026 buyout market instead of a trade. The move is tied to the team’s need for consistent shooting behind Jalen Brunson as the regular season moves toward the playoffs.Niang was waived by the Memphis Grizzlies after being included in the Eric Gordon-Jaren Jackson Jr. deal. He has not played during the 2025-26 season while recovering from offseason foot surgery, but his shooting history and playoff experience make him a realistic option for teams trying to compete immediately.Georges Niang is currently a free agent and can sign with any team once he clears waivers and passes a physical. The Knicks are below the second apron, have an open roster spot, and enough flexibility to take on his $8.2 million expiring salary.There are no trade assets involved. Memphis moved on from Niang to complete its roster changes, and New York would simply use an open spot to add a veteran who has appeared in 56 playoff games and shot 39.9% from three over his career.New York’s bench has struggled to produce points and reliable three-point shooting this season.Niang, a 6-foot-8 stretch forward, fits a clear need. He can space the floor for Brunson and Karl-Anthony Towns, move without the ball, and keep the offense organized when starters sit.• Backcourt: Jalen Brunson, Miles McBride, Landry Shamet, Jordan Clarkson, Tyler Kolek, Jose Alvarado.• Wings: OG Anunoby, Mikal Bridges, Josh Hart, Kevin McCullar Jr., Dillon Jones.• Frontcourt: Karl-Anthony Towns, Mitchell Robinson, Ariel Hukporti, Trey Jemison, Pacome Dadiet, Mohamed Diawara.Niang would add depth rather than replace anyone. His shooting gives coach Tom Thibodeau another lineup option, especially in tighter games.His shooting would address a second unit that often struggles to create space when Brunson is off the floor.The Knicks offer a competitive environment and a defined role. Playing next to Brunson gives Niang steady catch-and-shoot chances, and joining a contender is preferable to signing with a rebuilding team.Profile:• Age: 32 (born July 1993)• Position: Stretch four / small-ball five• Contract: $8.2 million expiringThe deal also allows him to rebuild value before free agency.• Reliable three-point shooting• Expiring contract with little long-term risk• Playoff experience• More lineup flexibility in the frontcourt• Recovering from foot surgery with no clear return date• Not a strong defender• Could reduce minutes for younger forwardsFor Niang, the main advantage is joining a contender with a clear role. The risk is limited playing time if he is not fully healthy, along with no guaranteed contract beyond this season.Brunson regularly draws extra defenders in pick-and-roll situations. A forward who can shoot from the perimeter makes those rotations harder for defenses.If Niang is healthy in time for the postseason, the Knicks add an experienced shooter without giving up players or draft capital. Niang joins a team competing in the Eastern Conference playoff race. The larger impact, however, would be on New York’s depth.Also read: NBA trade rumors: Los Angeles Lakers could acquire $6 million Brooklyn Nets star to play Alongside Luka Doncic and improve championship odds The Knicks are in position to sign Georges Niang through the buyout market and add shooting without changing the current roster. If he returns before the playoffs, the signing could strengthen the bench and improve lineup balance heading into the postseason.","The New York Knicks are projected to pursue veteran forward Georges Niang through the 2026 buyout market instead of a trade.

Why is Stephen Curry ruled out vs San Antonio Spurs? (February 11, 2026)

Golden State Warriors rotation faces added pressure

Spurs enter game with stronger availability

What Curry’s absence changes

Stephen Curry's Expected return after break

Stephen Curry should return in time

against the San Antonio Spurs on. Theruled him out with right-knee patellofemoral pain syndrome, extending his absence to five games.Golden State is choosing not to rush Curry back before the All-Star break. Head coach Steve Kerr said the team is targeting a return around February 19 against the Boston Celtics so the veteran guard can recover fully before the final stretch of the season.The NBA injury report lists Stephen Curry as “Out” with right patellofemoral pain syndrome, a condition commonly linked to irritation around the kneecap.He has been managing the issue for several weeks, and the Warriors are focused on his long-term availability rather than a short-term return. Without Curry, the team loses its main ballhandler, perimeter shooter, and late-game scorer. His movement also creates spacing that is difficult to replace.Golden State still has players who can absorb larger roles, but the rotation is thinner because of additional injuries.Key players expected to handle more responsibility include:• Jonathan Kuminga - A primary scoring option who attacks the paint and contributes on the glass.• Andrew Wiggins - A reliable two-way wing capable of defending multiple positions while providing steady scoring.• Moses Moody - A perimeter shooter who can also handle the ball when needed.• Gary Payton II - Adds point-of-attack defense and secondary playmaking.• Al Horford / Quinten Post - Likely to split center minutes with Kristaps Porzingis sidelined by an Achilles injury.L.J. Cryer is out with a left hamstring strain. Will Richard is questionable with a bruised right knee, and De’Anthony Melton is questionable due to a left gluteal contusion.San Antonio comes into the matchup relatively healthy. Victor Wembanyama is active and averaging more than 24 points and 11 rebounds while anchoring both ends of the floor for a team that leads the Southwest Division.Devin Vassell and Keldon Johnson are expected to start on the wings. Harrison Barnes, Stephon Castle, and Dylan Harper complete the core rotation unless there are late updates.Castle and Lindy Waters III are listed as questionable with a pelvic contusion and a knee issue, but neither situation carries the same impact as Curry’s absence.Without its primary pick-and-roll creator and most dangerous off-the-dribble shooter, Golden State may see tighter defensive coverage. San Antonio can focus on limiting drives from Kuminga and Wiggins while forcing secondary playmakers into tougher decisions.Betting lines have already adjusted to reflect a less productive Warriors offense and a matchup that leans toward San Antonio’s size and pace.The Warriors plan to keep Curry out through the break and aim for a February 19 return against Boston. The extra time allows for rehab and load management, which is important for a 37-year-old guard whose game depends on balance and quick movement.Also read: San Antonio Spurs vs Golden State Warriors injury report: Who's playing, injured and questionable players, head-to-head records, team stats, and more (February 11, 2026) If the everything with schedule remains the same thenfor the team's push toward the postseason.

San Antonio Spurs vs Golden State Warriors Season Series and Team Performance

San Antonio Spurs vs Golden State Warriors Matchups to Watch

Theface theon Wednesday,, in San Francisco. San Antonio leads the Southwest Division, while Golden State is trying to move up the Western Conference standings.The teams are in different situations with injuries. The Spurs have most of their core available but are monitoring a few rotation players. The Warriors are missing several key names, which could affect their lineup and minutes distribution.San Antonio enters the game with a mostly healthy roster but has two players listed as questionable.- Stephon Castle is dealing with a pelvic contusion after a hard fall against the Lakers and is a game-time decision. If he does not play, Dylan Harper and Jordan McLaughlin are expected to handle more of the ball, which would reduce the team’s secondary creation.- Lindy Waters III is questionable with a knee issue after sitting out the February 10 game. If unavailable, more minutes should go to Keldon Johnson and Julian Champagnie.- David Jones Garcia is out for the season after ankle surgery. His absence affects depth but does not significantly change the current rotation.- Victor Wembanyama is fully active and averaging more than 24 points and 11 rebounds. Devin Vassell remains the primary wing scorer, and Johnson, Harrison Barnes, Castle, and Harper are expected to play unless there are late changes.Golden State continues to manage several injuries.- Stephen Curry has been ruled out with a knee issue and is expected to miss multiple games. His absence removes the team’s main shot creator.- Kristaps Porzingis is still recovering from an Achilles problem and is not expected back until after the All-Star break. Al Horford, Quinten Post, and Malevy Leons are handling the center minutes.- L.J. Cryer is out with a hamstring injury and is expected to miss time until at least February 19.- Will Richard is questionable with a bruised right knee. If he cannot play, Pat Spencer, Gary Payton II, and Moses Moody will take on more ball-handling duties.- De’Anthony Melton is also questionable with a left gluteal contusion. His absence would weaken perimeter defense and secondary playmaking.- Jimmy Butler III is out after surgery to repair a torn ACL.- Draymond Green, Horford, Moody, Brandin Podziemski, and Payton II are expected to be available.The lineup is built around Wembanyama’s interior defense and scoring. Castle and Vassell handle most of the backcourt production, while Barnes provides experience.Without Curry and Porzingis, the offense runs more through Green, with Moody taking on a larger scoring role.This game is part of a four-game season series that is currently tied 1-1. Each team has won once at home. Golden State took the first meeting behind Curry’s 46-point performance, while San Antonio answered with a win led by Wembanyama’s 30-point triple-double. The Warriors hold a slight edge in the all-time series, but the Spurs have had more success since Wembanyama joined the team.San Antonio is 37-16 and averages about 117.5 points, 55.2 rebounds, and 26.3 assists per game while allowing roughly 112.5 points. Wembanyama leads the team with 24.4 points, 11.1 rebounds, 3.4 assists, and a league-high 4.8 blocks. Castle averages 18.8 points and 5.4 assists, while Vassell adds 16.8 points.Golden State is 29-25 and averages around 115.6 points, 51 rebounds, and 28.7 assists. The team allows about 113.5 points per game and gives up 50 points in the paint on average. Green is producing roughly 8 points, 7 rebounds, and 7 assists. Moody is scoring around 17 to 18 points, and Podziemski is contributing about 14 to 15 points with solid rebounding.San Antonio has a size advantage, especially with Porzingis unavailable. Golden State will rely on Horford and Post to defend Wembanyama.Without Curry, the Warriors are expected to run more offense through Green, Moody, and Podziemski. San Antonio’s perimeter defense, led by Vassell and Castle, will be important.Rebounding also favors the Spurs, who average more than 55 per game compared to Golden State’s 51.Player availability could influence the result. If several Warriors questionables cannot play while San Antonio remains mostly healthy, the Spurs would enter with a clearer edge.San Antonio comes in with advantages in size, rebounding, and overall availability. Golden State will depend on Green’s leadership and scoring from Moody and others to remain competitive, but the injuries create a smaller margin for error.Also read: Is Stephen Curry playing tonight vs the San Antonio Spurs?

Why Nikola Jokic’s presence matters

Thewhen they face the Memphis Grizzlies on Wednesday, February 11, 2026. He is listed as probable on the official injury report because of a left ankle sprain.That designation usually means a player is expected to play unless there is a setback before tipoff. For Denver, Jokic’s availability matters even more with several rotation players already ruled out.Nikola Jokic has been dealing with the ankle issue but has continued to stay on the court. Since returning from a right-knee hyperextension earlier this season, he has not missed time and remains central to how Denver runs its offense and defense.The Nuggets are without Aaron Gordon and Peyton Watson, both out with right hamstring strains. Their absence reduces Denver’s defensive depth and places more responsibility on the remaining starters.In most cases, a probable listing suggests a strong chance of playing. Jokic is expected to start and handle his normal role, although Denver could manage his minutes if the score gets out of hand.With the All-Star break approaching and a busy second half ahead, the team has reason to be careful.Betting lines and player props have not shifted in a way that would indicate he might be ruled out.Denver is expected to rely heavily on Jokic, Jamal Murray, and Christian Braun to cover for the missing frontcourt pieces.Memphis is also short-handed. The team moved Jaren Jackson Jr. at the trade deadline and is working new players such as Walter Clayton Jr., Taylor Hendricks, Kyle Anderson, and Georges Niang into the rotation.Because of these absences, Denver entered the matchup favored by around 14.5 points.The Nuggets are 34-20 and third in the Western Conference. Memphis is 20-32 and sits 11th after losing nine of its last 11 games. Denver has also struggled recently, dropping four of its past five, including a close loss to Cleveland.When Jokic returned from his knee issue earlier in the season, Denver’s results improved. The team has consistently performed better with him on the floor. Against a Memphis lineup missing several interior players, he is in position to produce across the box score.Also read: Memphis Grizzlies vs Denver Nuggets injury report: Who's playing, injured and questionable players, head-to-head records, team stats, and more (February 11, 2026) Nikola Jokic is listed as probable and is expected to play against the Grizzlies.

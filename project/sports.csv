IND vs AUS 1st Test: Visitors rocked by Rohit unavailability, Gill injury; batting a serious concern

NEW DELHI: While all eyes are trained on how the Indian team will fare in the five Tests in Australia from Friday, coach Gautam Gambhir and chief selector Ajit Agarkar will also be working on a roadmap for the future of the white-ball teams, apart from the Test squad.TOI understands that Agarkar has been asked to stay in Australia for the entire length of the tour to work closely with Gambhir and get an understanding of how each player is placed in his career. Following the 0-3 debacle at home against New Zealand, talk of transition has gathered steam.According to BCCI sources, the idea is to ensure that both Agarkar and Gambhir are on the same page on the matter. There has been speculation that there is a lack of synchronization over some of the recent strategies and selections.""Both Agarkar and Gambhir know that such poor performance in India will trigger widespread criticism, which is justified. Since it's a long tour, both can sit together and discuss how things can be taken forward after the tour,"" a BCCI source said. ""Both will need at least a year and a half to build a team with strong backup. That's where both have to be on the same page about the process.""It is learnt that one of the major tasks is to speak with the senior players about their future plans. Captain Virat Kohli , R Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja are all in their late 30s. ""These senior players are still a very important part of the team. But one may expect some tough discussions as well. The seniors will be kept in the loop about the vision of the selectors and coach. They will be asked to share how they plan their careers going into the next World Test Championship cycle and the ODI World Cup being about two years away,"" the source said.It may be noted that the turnaround time for the ICC Champions Trophy is very short after the fiveTest series. India have just three ODIs and five T20Is against England at home. The workload of the Test players will be reviewed. It is understood that the selectors, Rohit and Gambhir will also try to zero down on the core for the Champions Trophy.Gambhir is also keen on having a niche T20 team with T20 specialists only, and not multi-format players, which is likely to come up for debate. The confusion stems from the fact that India's multi-format players are often rested from T20I bilateral series. ""The T20 format requires specialists but there are a few players like Bumrah, Pant, Jaiswal and Gill who can't be ignored. Most of the T20I series are played against weaker oppositions or teams who also rest topline players. There is a line of thought that the youngsters in the T20 team then have to make way for the Test players when they are available,"" the source said.",Gautam Gambhir and Ajit Agarkar will work on roadmap for future of white-ball teams.

What IPL can do as far as salaries of players are concerned?

NEW DELHI: Legendary Indian player Sunil Gavaskar has predicted that Chennai Super Kings (CSK) and Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) might go all out to secure wicketkeeper-batter KL Rahul in the upcoming IPL 2025 mega auction .With his proven record as a consistent run-scorer and his leadership experience, Rahul could become a hot commodity for teams seeking a reliable top-order batsman and potential captaincy material.Gavaskar highlighted that both CSK and RCB could benefit significantly from Rahul’s ability when needed. His versatility and composure make him an ideal fit for franchises looking to strengthen their batting lineup, setting the stage for an intense bidding war.LSG made a notable decision by not retaining their captain Rahul while keeping Nicholas Pooran, Ravi Bishnoi, Mayank Yadav, Mohsin Khan and Ayush Badoni in their roster.Meanwhile, RCB chose to retain three cricketers - Virat Kohli, Rajat Patidar and Yash Dayal, and CSK kept five players in their squad - Ruturaj Gaikwad, Matheesha Pathirana, Shivam Dube, Ravindra Jadeja and MS Dhoni.The two southern teams will participate in the auction with substantial budgets - RCB with Rs 83 crore to fill 22 positions and CSK with Rs 55 crore for 20 spots.Also See: IPL Mega Auction 2025 ""I do believe that the two south franchises, Bengaluru as well as Chennai, will go for KL Rahul. Maybe even Hyderabad will go, but Bangalore is of course KL Rahul's hometown. So clearly I think he will be enthused, he will be encouraged, he will want to play in front of his home crowd. So Bengaluru might go for KL Rahul,"" Gavaskar said on Star Sports.Sanjay Manjrekar, former India cricketer, shared his analysis regarding David Warner 's prospects during the auction discussions. The ex-cricketer offered insights about the renowned international batter, who has earned recognition for his aggressive batting style.""It's been a few years since David Warner's performances have been great. But he is still a great player. When Devon Conway was released by CSK, I'm sure they will buy him back. They are quite influenced by Rachid Ravindra as well. I don't think they will be interested in bringing David Warner into their plans. I don't think Warner can fit in CSK,"" Manjrekar said.Manjrekar also elaborated on how Mohammed Shami 's recent fitness concerns will influence the auction proceedings.""There will definitely be interest from teams, but given Shami's injury history — and this recent one took a significant amount of time to recover — there’s always a concern about a potential breakdown during the season. If a franchise invests heavily and then loses him mid-season, their options become limited. This concern might lead to a drop in his price tag,"" he said.",Chennai Super Kings (CSK) and Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) might go all out to secure wicketkeeper-batter KL Rahul in the upcoming IPL 2025 mega auction.

Without missing a beat, Rahul answered, "" Virat Kohli ,"" much to the amusement of fans and fellow cricketers alike.The response came as no surprise to many, given the long-standing friendship between the two cricketing stars. Kohli, widely regarded as one of the greatest modern-day cricketers, has been a prominent figure not only in Indian cricket but globally, and his influence extends far beyond the sport.Rahul's answer highlighted the close bond they share, with the two having played together in numerous international matches and even sharing success on and off the field.Rahul's simple yet candid response also underscored the camaraderie and mutual respect that exists between the two players, who have often supported each other in both challenging times and moments of glory.During the same Q&A session, pacer Mohammed Siraj asked Virat Kohli to pick his favourite knock in Australia. Kohli chose his stunning century in Perth from the 2018-19 series as his top pick.Despite India's heavy loss by 146 runs in that match, Kohli's innings stood out as he was the lone Indian batter to shine, while the rest of the team struggled. His century remains a memorable and gritty performance, showcasing his resilience in challenging conditions.As Kohli responded to questions from the BCCI's Social Media team, both Sarfaraz and Mohammed Siraj were seen enthusiastically saying ""Legend, Legend,"" a clear display of the deep respect he commands from his teammates."," BCCI conducted Q&A session ahead of Border-Gavaskar Trophy.

Virat & Rohit’s Home Struggles: Left-Arm Spin & Lost Intent? | Beyond the Boundary Highlights

The focus on Virat Kohli is getting closer and closer as the opening Test of the Border Gavaskar Trophy (BGT) in Perth approaches its start date -- November 22. And while many have doubted the batting icon's return to form from a lean phase in red-ball cricket since 2020, Australia's ace spinner Nathan Lyon believes that a champion player like Kohli is always a threat.The 36-year-old Lyon, who has played 129 Tests and is Australia's leading off-spinner with 530 Test wickets, will once again play a key role in Australia's bowling attack dominated by fast bowlers that will try to put the out-of-form Kohli under pressure right from the start of the series.Lyon says the respect Kohli has earned over the years with his performances can't be ignored just because he hasn't scored many runs lately.""Look at his record out here,"" Lyon said. ""Overall, look at his record. You don't write off champions. I've got nothing but respect for Virat,"" Lyon said, as quoted by the Australian Associated Press.Since his first tour of Australia in 2011-12, Kohli has scored 1352 runs in 25 innings across 13 Tests at an average of 54.08, including 6 hundreds and 4 fifties.However, Kohli has not been on the top of his game in the post-Covid era, with just two hundreds coming off his bat in the last 60 innings. Lately, in the Test series against Bangladesh and New Zealand at home before flying to Australia, Kohli aggregated just 192 runs in 10 innings.""I want to get him out. There's no point in hiding behind that, but it's challenging. It's been pretty amazing competing against him for so many times,"" Lyon said.India were whitewashed by New Zealand 0-3 at home before flying out to Australia, but Lyon felt not much should be read into that because of India's record in Australia in recent times.India won the series on their last two Test tours of Australia and are in possession of the BGT for the last decade.""They're dangerous all the time. They're a side full of superstars. They've got so much experience, but talented youth as well, and you can never write off that,"" said Lyon.""I was fascinated by that series against New Zealand, but we're expecting the best India that we've played against for a number of years now.""",India face Australia in first Test of Border Gavaskar Trophy (BGT) in Perth on November 22.

Australia batters will find it difficult and have issues of their own

NEW DELHI: Former Indian captain Sourav Ganguly has voiced his confidence in the team's preparedness for the upcoming high-stakes five-match Test series against Australia, dismissing concerns about the team being ""undercooked.""""Undercooked is a term used when you haven't played any Test cricket at all. They have just played five Tests in the last seven weeks so how does the question even arise?"" the former BCCI president told PTI in an interview ahead of the marquee series.Speaking about the recent Test series loss to New Zealand, Ganguly acknowledged the unexpected nature of the defeat but emphasized the challenging nature of the pitches.""I can understand that the defeat against New Zealand was unexpected but you have to understand we played on some extremely difficult tracks. In Australia, the tracks will be good for batting,"" Ganguly said.He also highlighted the need for India to return to playing on balanced cricket tracks that foster both batting and bowling skills, suggesting that over-reliance on rank turners could hinder players' confidence and adaptability in different conditions.""I don't think so. But I must say that we need to get back to playing on good cricket pitches at home.""We should stop this habit of playing on rank turners. The batsmen lose confidence on such tracks and we have a team which can win Test matches on good tracks.""Also on turners, you need to learn to grind before you can attack. There are two types of tracks where you can't just hit through the line and get out of trouble. One is a seaming track and other being a rank turner.""Shubman Gill's thumb fracture is undoubtedly a setback for India, but Ganguly remains confident in the team's ability and mental strength to move past their recent shock loss.Gill, who boasts five centuries in 29 Tests, played pivotal roles during India’s previous tour, scoring a half-century in Melbourne and a match-defining 91 in Brisbane, which contributed to two memorable victories.However, the young opener sustained a left thumb fracture while fielding in an intra-squad simulation game between the senior team and India A, ruling him out of the first Test.""Shubman's injury is jolt for the team no doubt as he is an in-form batter and has scored in Australia. A thumb fracture could rule him out for two Tests.""But I believe the other batters would step up in absence of Rohit (on paternity leave) and Shubman during the first Test. I don't think New Zealand defeat would have any bearing on this series,"" the former BCCI president told PTI in an interview ahead of the marquee series.With Hardik Pandya no longer featuring in Test cricket, India lack genuine pace-bowling all-rounders. While Nitish Kumar Reddy remains relatively inexperienced, one of India's most celebrated captains believes the Andhra cricketer should be given opportunities in conditions that suit his skill set.""Look, there is absolutely no point in playing two specialist spinners either at Perth (Optus) or at the Gabba (Brisbane). You obviously need to find a way to play Reddy in these conditions. He is a good batsman and coming in at lower middle order, it will lend proper balance to the side,"" he gave his rationale for inclusion of a multi-skilled player.Ganguly also felt that Mohammed Shami should have travelled to Adelaide and played the second Test starting December 6, which is a day/night game. Shami is not being fast-tracked immediately by the selectors, who want him to play in Syed Mushtaq Ali T20 tournament before taking a call on his travel Down Under.""Shami bowled nearly 45 overs, fielded for more than 100 overs and also scored some runs. That's a good enough fitness test to be sent to Australia because you need a bowler of his calibre alongside Jasprit Bumrah .""",Former Indian captain Sourav Ganguly has voiced his confidence in the team's preparedness for the upcoming high-stakes five-match Test series against Australia. Ganguly also highlighted the need for India to return to playing on balanced cricket tracks that foster both batting and bowling skills.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115455677,imgsize-89064,width-400,resizemode-4/115455677.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Former India player Robin Uthappa has suggested Rajat Patidar as a potential captain for Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) in the Indian Premier League (IPL) 2025.RCB will need to consider leadership alternatives for IPL 2025 , following their decision not to retain Faf du Plessis Despite the availability of established players like Jos Buttler, Rishabh Pant , and Shreyas Iyer in the mega auction, Uthappa recommends that RCB should consider giving Patidar an opportunity to lead the team.""I think they should look at Rajat Patidar to take over that role because it seems like you need a new leader after two years. So, you might as well do it now to get ahead of the curve and build a captain for the next three to five years. Rajat is one of those players who can actually play that role for them,"" Uthappa said on JioCinema.RCB opted for a strategic approach by keeping only three players in their roster. The franchise chose to retain Virat Kohli , Patidar and the emerging fast bowler Yash Dayal.This decision led to the departure of several key players from the team, including Mohammed Siraj Will Jacks and Glenn Maxwell. Armed with a substantial budget of Rs 83 crore and the Right To Match card, RCB aim to build a strong team capable of securing their maiden IPL championship.Former India cricketer Saba Karim suggests that RCB might utilise their Right to Match (RTM) option to secure both Mohammed Siraj and Will Jacks, considering their valuable contributions across various aspects of the game.""RCB can always go back to Siraj because he's been phenomenal for the side. They got Yash Dayal as a left-arm seam bowler, which is a wonderful thing, but they also need someone to give him proper company. So, if RCB can have Siraj, then at least the pace bowling section is kind of filled up. I'm also looking at Will Jacks. He was very good for them last season. He can come in right at the top, and he's also a very useful right-arm off-break bowler,"" Karim said.",Robin Uthappa has suggested Rajat Patidar as a potential captain for Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) in the Indian Premier League (IPL) 2025.

India likely to hand two debuts in first Border-Gavaskar Trophy Test vs Australia in Perth

Excerpts:

India have history on their side as they have won the last two BGT in Australia. Do you feel the buildup is a bit different this time around as compared to what happened during your playing days. Not many expected India to do well Down Under...

Over the years, the contest between the two sides has become one of the most sought after properties in the cricket calendar. You have played a lot of matches involving India and Australia... did you ever imagine that this will become as popular as The Ashes or a India-Pakistan contest?

Talking about Australia.

and Co. have achieved literally everything possible within their reach. So you reckon this BGT will probably tick most of the boxes off for most of these players who, like their Indian counterparts, are towards the fag end of their careers. How important is this series going to be for the likes of Cummins, (Mitchell) Starc etc...

Ravi Shastri, Rahul Dravid and now Gautam Gambhir. India have a new coach and he is set for the toughest challenge yet. What do you expect from the new Indian head coach since you have seen him very closely during your playing days and then during the IPL?

The last time India were in Australia, they had to deal with a lot of adverse situations. Player availability, injury and then a series during the COVID-19 period. Even this time around, there is a sense of unsettledness in the Indian camp with

, no

. Do you reckon the bowling will be overdependent on

?

Hardly any talk around the two but this series could well see two modern-day great off-spinners (

and Nathan Lyon) up against each other for probably the last time in Tests. How excited are you to see them perform for their respective sides because they have left a stamp the way they have played in the previous few series wherever India and Australia have met.

India prepare for tough Test series in Australia

You reckon India's fragility against spin in the recent past could be weighing up on Nathan Lyon's mind? World he be licking his fingers to have a crack at this Indian batting line-up?

Gautam Gambhir, head coach of India, looks on with Morne Morkel, bowling coach of India, during the practice match between India and India A at WACA in Perth. (Getty Images)

How much of a role do you think 'local boy' Morne Morkel, who is settled in Australia, will have to instill that group mentality. He certainly would know a thing or two about doing well in Australia, right? A world class bowler himself and now India's bowling coach.

You think India-Australia contests have become friendlier than what they used to be back in the day? The IPL probably bringing the players close and helping them forge those friendships.

KL Rahul made his Test debut in Australia, had scored a hundred. A decade later, he is still struggling for consistency. What would be your advice to him?

What are your thoughts on the Australian camp. Opening combination, team balance... from the outside, you reckon they are in a settled space?

The first Test of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy is just three sleeps away and the excitement is building for what promises to be a cracking series between two quality sides. India have been training in Perth for more than a week now and the visitors have been rocked by some availability and injury concerns before the series opener on November 22.There is a lot of chatter around the form of Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma but former Australia cricketer Mike Hussey expects India to put up a solid show in the five-match series.In an exclusive chat with, the former southpaw opens up on the series, India's new head coach Gautam Gambhir, battle of two great off-spinners, and more.I think everyone in Australia is really excited about the series and fascinated to see what's going to happen. I mean, yeah, India have won the last two times in Australia, so they'll certainly take some of that confidence into into the series. And I think quite a few of the Australian players will be really, really up for it and really keen to do well and almost try and put the record straight, because we don't lose too many times in Australia. So, it's going to be a fascinating series. It should be high-quality cricket. And I think everyone in the country just can't wait for it to start.The Ashes is always very special for an Australian and an English player as well. But, yeah, I'm not sure we can ever compete with India versus Pakistan. That's a unique series, and the rivalry is obviously very strong there. But yeah, I agree. India has turned themselves into a real powerhouse of world cricket. Australia have been pretty strong over the last 20 or 30 years. So I think the rivalry has really grown. And, two great teams, two great nations, going head to head. That's what everyone wants to see.I think Pat Cummins has still got a fair bit of cricket ahead of him. He's certainly not as old as a Mitchell Starc and Nathan Lyon , etc. So I think you'll want to keep going for a fair few years yet. But I know what you're saying. I think some of the players might see this as a their last opportunity to beat India in Australia. So that'll offer them some motivation. But to be honest, you don't need any extra motivation when you're playing in a Test match. Test series against India in Australia... I mean, it doesn't get much bigger than that, so I don't think they'll use it necessarily as extra motivation. But they'll want to win and and finish their careers with victory against India on home soil.Similar to when he was a player... he was a great competitor and he would fight all the way for victory. And so I have no doubt, watching him, sort of being involved with the IPL and teams that he's been involved in, he loves to win, and he loves to compete and I'm not expecting anything different from this Indian team. They've got some great fighters and some great competitors. So I'm sure his personality will come through with the way he coaches. And I think you need to have something like that in in Australian conditions. It's not easy coming to Australia and competing with a strong Australian team.And I think Ravi Shastri certainly brought that really competitive hard edge to the team when he was coaching the team as well, and real positiveness as well. Gambhir is someone that's done well in Australia in the past as well. He will have fond memories of coming here. He's a real fighter and a real competitor. And I'm sure he'll bring that in this Indian team as well.You think of the last series that India were in Australia, and they had a lot of adversity. They lost Shami early... . I think broke his arm and went home early as well. But they still managed to find a way and bring in new players and perform really well. And I think Ravi and the players need a lot of credit. Rahane led the team well and Ravi kept instilling his positive attitude in whoever came in... that they could compete and they could win in Australia. It's all about the having the right attitude. We know there's so much talent and so much depth in Indian cricket.We've seen it so many times to ride off champion players... pundits come out and say that Rohit Sharma is finished and Virat Kohli is no good anymore. I mean, that's just ridiculous. They're legend, legendary players. They're proud players. If you write them off, you're just going to end up having egg on your face, because they will perform well again. They're too good not to. I think it's silly to write them off and write off the Indian team as well. It's just not in my vocabulary.I think they'll both play really important roles for the team, and probably throw Jadeja in there as well. Nathan Lyon, we quite often say it as commentators, that he is actually the most important bowler in the Australian lineup because he can bowl a lot of overs. He can bowl in a attacking sense. He can bowl in a defensive sense. He allows the fast bowlers to rotate from the other end. And so he's such a crucial part of the Australian team.I think Ashwin, he might have struggled the first couple of times that he came to Australia, like a lot of players do. A smart bowler and a smart man over time, and over more tours, will figure out how to bowl well in Australian conditions. And so I'm expecting if he plays the majority of the Tests, I'm expecting him to have a really good series. And play a really important role for India because if he can bowl really well and strongly at one end, then that enables the captain to attack from the other end, to rotate the fast bowls around from the other end. So it's going to be a classic battle.And I know we talk about (Jasprit) Bumrah, we talk about Starc and Cummins and the like but it could be how the spinners go head to head, that could be the difference between the two teams in the end, you know, because they both play such important roles.The conditions in India are a lot different to what these they're going to pop in Australia. You know that the pitches generally will be a lot faster and bounce here... probably take a lot less spin. Nathan Lyon will have to just bowl well, like he always does in Australian conditions. And when he does bowl well, he's a real hand. The Australian attack just doesn't rely on Lyon or just Starc. They see it as a real group mentality.Talking on the group mentality, India too just can't rely on Bumrah. It'll have to be that group mentality for India to be able to win the series.It'll be very important but at the end of the day, the bowlers have to go out and do the job. Monet's got great experience about playing in Australia. He knows the conditions well. He's performed well himself, so he knows what it takes to play well in Australian conditions. And so that experience will be invaluable, no doubt. And I'm sure he's a he's a great person, a great character, and he will pass that, actually pass that mentality under the Indian bowlers as well. But at the end of the day, the Indian bowlers have to do the job.Both teams will really want to win for their countries, and you have pride in your own performance as well, whether they're friendly to each other in the middle, or they're not, or they're, you know, angry at each other, I don't think that'll have any bearing on the series at all. I think, you know, once it comes down. It's bat versus ball. It's country versus country, and that's all, that's all that matters at the end of the day.He's another fantastic player. So I guess, just to trust his game and to be confident with whatever he does, you know that's the most important thing. We know how good he is. And so I guess there's a lot of external people put these doubts in your mind, but I just hope that he just doesn't worry about all the external stuff and just concentrates on his game, his preparation, and just tries to play his best possible cricket, because when he's playing at his best, he's one of the best players in the world.And to be honest, that's what we want to see in this series. We want to see two great teams with great players from both sides, you know, going at it head to head. I'm sure if he can start well in the series, get a good score under his belt early, then that'll help his confidence the rest of the series.I think the team is pretty settled... There was a lot of talk in Australia about who was going to open the batting and it seems like they've settled on Nathan McSweeney to do that role. So I'm pretty sure that the Australian team is settled. They'll just go about their preparation and be ready to go for Friday.",Former Australia cricketer Mike Hussey expects India to put up a solid show in the five-match series.

NEW DELHI: Pep Guardiola will reportedly stay as manager of Manchester City for at least one more year, according to The Athletic.The Athletic reports Guardiola will sign a one-year extension to his current contract, which expires at the end of this season, with an option for another year. The 53-year-old manager has already signed two contract extensions during his time at City, both during the November international break.Guardiola’s potential extension comes amidst a turbulent period for Manchester City. The club is facing an ongoing hearing over 115 breaches of the Premier League ’s financial regulations, leading to speculation about Guardiola's future. Adding to the uncertainty, City’s director of football , Txiki Begiristain, will leave the club at the end of the season.Despite the challenges, keeping Guardiola would be a significant boost for the club. “The retention of one the most decorated coaches in football history would be a massive boost to the morale of City players and fans,” stated The Athletic.Since joining Manchester City in 2016, Guardiola has led the team to significant victories, including six Premier League titles and the club’s first-ever Champions League title.","Pep Guardiola will reportedly stay as manager of Manchester City for at least one more year.

Lautaro Martinez's goal gave Argentina a 1-0 win over Peru on Tuesday in a South American qualifying match in Buenos Aires and left the hosts close to a spot in the 2026 World Cup in the United States, Mexico and Canada.Their main continental rivals Brazil drew 1-1 against Uruguay in Salvador, Brazil with two impressive goals in an otherwise lackluster match. Federico Valverde gave Uruguay the lead with a curled shot from the edge of the box, and Gerson netted his first for Brazil in similar fashion at the Arena Fonte Nova.Argentina lead South American qualifying with 25 points from 12 matches, five points clear of its closest competitor, Uruguay. Ecuador and Colombia are next with 19 points each.Brazil lag in fifth position with 18 points after several uninspiring performances, still hoping that striker Neymar will return from injury and fit in again. Paraguay, with 17 points, are in sixth place.South American qualifying will give six direct berths in the next World Cup.

""We've come close on a couple of occasions and the next step is for me and the other boys to win.""We have a new coach coming in March.

Te emocionará: el anuncio de Nike que repasa la carrera de Rafa Nadal desde los 16 años I MARCA

Roger Federer—who during his career showed a tennis racket could compose Mozart’s Symphony Number 40 — paid an emotional tribute to his greatest rival, Rafael Nadal , who is getting set for his last dance in the Davis Cup . Federer wrote: “And you know what, Rafa, you made me enjoy the game even more…. I thought I was on top of the world. And I was—until two months later, when you walked on the court in Miami in your red sleeveless shirt, showing off those biceps, and you beat me convincingly. All that buzz I'd been hearing about you—about this amazing young player from Mallorca, a generational talent, probably going to win a major someday—it wasn't just hype.” Federer wasn’t the only one left in awe of the young player from Mallorca.Watching Rafael Nadal play was like being back in a stuffy English class, as if the stanzas of Rudyard Kipling ’s If had been infused into a living, breathing person. Nadal’s entire career could easily serve as an exposition to explain the poem. He kept his head when all others were losing theirs, trusted himself when others doubted him, met Triumph and Disaster, and treated both impostors the same. He filled the unforgiving minute with sixty seconds’ worth of distance run, forcing his heart, nerve, and sinew to serve his turn long after they were gone, holding on through sheer will. He talked with the crowds and kept his virtue, walked with kings and never lost his common touch.It’s fitting that a few lines from If are etched over Centre Court at Wimbledon, the venue of his greatest triumph: his 2008 All England Final win against Roger Federer on a surface Federer ruled, one not naturally conducive to Nadal’s game. Nadal had lost the last two finals to Federer—who had won the previous five—and the received wisdom was that the 'King of Grass' would make it six.Federer hadn’t lost a match at Wimbledon since 2002—65 matches unbeaten—and it would take 4 hours and 48 minutes to find a winner. Federer won more games in the titanic battle and served 25 aces (14 in the fourth set). Yet Nadal saved 16 of the 19 break points in the match, cementing his status as a player who could triumph on surfaces beyond his favoured clay by beating the greatest ever to play on grass.Alongside Federer and Djokovic, Nadal would form a triumvirate that has virtually dominated tennis, winning a staggering 66 majors together. Each had unique gifts: Federer appeared powered by a perpetual motion machine from another world, effortlessly striking the ball. Djokovic epitomized skill meeting effort, with an almost Virat Kohli-like dedication to his craft, utterly unaffected by time and space.Nadal, on the other hand, seemed fuelled by an inability to accept defeat. As long as he was on the court with a tennis racket, no point was ever truly lost. He was, as Sir Alex Ferguson described Roy Keane, a ""captain who covered every blade of grass,"" a man who would ""rather die of exhaustion than lose."" That quote encapsulates Nadal’s career: he covered every blade of grass, every grain of sand, every inch of the hard court, every point of concrete. His mind and body did not fight against an opponent—they fought against the notion of defeat.Nadal’s topspin-heavy forehand, his ability to defend from anywhere, his indomitable baseline play, and his ever-improving serve made him hard to beat. But what made him invincible was his inability to lose. Only a maestro like Federer or a metahuman like Djokovic could occasionally find a way to defeat him, particularly when he was firing on all cylinders. And even they struggled to do it on clay. Fittingly, his last singles defeat on his favoured surface came as Djokovic completed his quest for Olympic gold for Serbia.Nadal’s all-action style took a toll on his body, which was often wracked with injuries from wrists to hips. He also suffered from Müller-Weiss syndrome, a degenerative foot condition that forced him to wear specially designed shoes. After the 2022 French Open (which Nadal won 6-3, 6-3, 6-0), Casper Ruud revealed that he saw Nadal walking on crutches. Ruud had thought he had a chance, but once on the court, he described Nadal’s effort as ""crazy."" Nadal later disclosed he had been taking pain-killing injections in his foot and that it was ""virtually asleep.""Nadal’s legacy is reflected in his numbers: 22 Grand Slam titles , 209 weeks as World No. 1, 92 ATP singles titles, Olympic golds in singles and doubles, five Davis Cups with Spain, and a 90%-win rate on clay.But numbers can’t truly capture the joy of watching Nadal, just as words can’t fully convey the divine experience of watching a Federer down-the-line backhand. Even those of us who worshipped at the altar of Saint Roger had to admit that witnessing his great rival was also a religious experience.Perhaps the closest piece of art that captures Nadal’s career—the joy of watching him, the astonishment at the ground he covered, his countless comebacks from near-defeat—was a Nike ad released after his 12th French Open win. It’s a kaleidoscope of his career, juxtaposing his emergence as a youngster with his countless battles over the years, as John McEnroe asks, “Is he going to play every point like that?” The answer, clearly, was always: Yes.","Rafael Nadal is set to retire from tennis at the end of the Davis Cup. Nadal won 66 majors during his career, including six Wimbledon titles. His greatest triumph came in the 2008 All England Final against Roger Federer.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115451285,imgsize-13258,width-400,resizemode-4/115451285.jpg"

Jaipur: Players from Pullela Gopichand Badminton Academy (PGBA) and Prakash Padukone Badminton Academy (PPBA) have dominated the national tournaments for years now. In the last two decades, most titles in sub-junior ranking tournaments were claimed by either PGBA or PPBA shuttlers.However, a major change seems to be happening in India’s badminton scenario. Smaller centres/academies with limited resources have started challenging players from the formidable academies and beating them.In the All India Sub-Junior (Under-15 and Under-17) Ranking tournament, which concluded at the Sawai Mansingh Indoor Stadium here on Tuesday, not a single title was won by powerhouses of Indian badminton. All the 10 titles were claimed by non-PGBA and PPBA shuttlers. More than 30 players were in action on the ninth and last day of the competition, and barring a couple of players, all finalists were from smaller academies.Just like cricket, badminton is witnessing a huge shift in talent catchment areas beyond Hyderabad and Bengaluru. Around two-three decades ago, most of the Indian cricket team’s players came from Mumbai, Delhi, Bangalore or other big centres. Now, several cricketers from smaller towns are making the cut.Dev Ruparelia, the U-17 boys’ singles winner here, hails from Palghar, a town in the Konkan division of Maharashtra. The top seed defeated Jagsher Singh Khangurra 21-18, 21-14 in the final. Eighth seed Jagsher belongs to Punjab and trains under former Indian shuttler Akshit Mahajan.“I started with Nitesh Badminton Academy in Palghar and stuck with it despite getting regular offers from the big centres. I train for nearly eight hours a day and am happy with the results. I don’t have any plans to shift anywhere as I get the best coaching in my hometown,” said Dev, who is ranked No. 2 in the U-17 boys singles. The promising shuttler has represented the junior India team twice.Similarly, Parul Choudhary, the champion in the U-17 girls’ singles, hails from Churu, a city in the desert region of Rajasthan. The India No. 3 trains in Gurgaon under coach Manish Sharma. The southpaw won back-to-back titles after she pocketed her maiden crown in the last All India ranking tournament in Vijayawada.“I get personal attention from my coaches. In the last one year or so, I have improved a lot and also became the first Rajasthani player to represent the junior Indian team. I want to achieve results in the U-19 as well as the women’s singles in the future,” said Parul, a niece of Paralympic javelin legend Devendra Jhajharia.Parul’s coach Manish Sharma admitted that the domination of big centres is slowly getting over and it’s a good sign that the game is growing rapidly in remote places.“Parents now want their kids to train individually rather than in a big bunch of players. Players and parents have now realised that one-to-one coaching is the need of the hour. We train Parul individually with a set of coaches and support staff. Several players of PGBA and PPBA have left them. Some of them have joined BAI’s National Centre of Excellence in Guwahati,” said Sharma.A senior BAI official said he is pleased with the results of the Jaipur tournament because it marked the beginning of a paradigm shift in national badminton. “The positive side of it is that we are no longer dependent on the two big centres. Now, the smaller academies are producing winners and coming out of the shadows of powerful academies. It will ultimately benefit Indian badminton,” said the BAI official.","Players from Pullela Gopichand Badminton Academy (PGBA) have dominated the national tournaments for years now.

Li advanced to the second round after defeating Japan's Natsuki Nidaira in straight games.Sen's match against Leong Jun Hao, which unfolded on Court 4, began with promise. Despite trailing 13-16 at one point, Sen rallied to win the first game 22-20.The subsequent games, however, proved to be a different story. Sen struggled to maintain the same level of composure.In the second game, Sen found himself trailing 1-4 but managed to level the score at 6-6. Leong Jun Hao, however, regained control, establishing a 11-7 lead. Despite a late surge by Sen, Leong Jun Hao held on to win the game 21-17.The final game saw Sen hold a marginal advantage for a period.

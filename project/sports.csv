NEW DELHI: With India set to kick off their Asia Cup 2025 campaign in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), head coach Gautam Gambhir has already created a buzz ahead of the tournament. The former Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) skipper was spotted carrying a KKR-branded kit bag during a practice session, a small gesture that instantly caught the attention of fans and sparked conversations on social media.Outside the ICC Academy ground in Dubai, Gambhir was also seen interacting warmly with supporters and signing autographs, further adding to the excitement building around India’s preparations. His popularity, both as a former player and now as a coach, continues to resonate strongly with fans.Under Gambhir’s mentorship, KKR clinched the IPL 2024 title, a triumph that further enhanced his reputation as a tactician. During his playing days, he had also captained the franchise to memorable title wins in 2012 and 2014. Now in a different role, Gambhir has carried forward his winning mentality into coaching. At the international level, he has already tasted success, guiding India to the ICC Champions Trophy title earlier in 2025. The Asia Cup provides him with another chance to underline his growing stature as a coach.Defending champions India will open their campaign on September 10 against hosts UAE at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium.Four days later, the much-anticipated showdown with Pakistan will take place at the same venue on September 14. India will conclude their group-stage assignments against Oman at the Sheikh Zayed Stadium in Abu Dhabi.The Asia Cup, running until September 28, will see eight teams competing for the coveted trophy. This edition, being played in the T20 format, is especially significant as it doubles up as preparation for the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup to be held next year in India and Sri Lanka. Since 2016, the Asia Cup has rotated between ODIs and T20Is, serving as a testing ground for Asian teams across formats.A total of 19 matches will be played, with 11—including the final—scheduled in Dubai, while Abu Dhabi will host the remaining eight. The India-Pakistan clash is expected to be the tournament’s biggest draw, ensuring packed houses and high television ratings.India boast the most successful record in Asia Cup history, with eight titles. Sri Lanka follow with six, while Pakistan have lifted the trophy twice. Despite the absence of stalwarts Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma, India are still considered favourites, backed by a strong bench and recent consistency.Group A features India, Oman, Pakistan, and hosts UAE. Group B includes Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Hong Kong, and Sri Lanka. The top two from each group will qualify for the Super Fours, from where the finalists will emerge.With Gambhir at the helm and India eager to defend their title, the spotlight will firmly remain on how the Men in Blue adapt and perform in UAE conditions once again.","Gautam Gambhir spotted carrying a KKR-branded kit bag during a practice session.

Exclusive Interview | RCB, Chess & Money in the Game: FIDE Junior World Champion Pranav V

Important and Indian results round 5 open (Indians unless specified):

NEW DELHI: Top seed Grandmaster R Praggnanandhaa suffered a shock defeat at the hands of Germany’s Matthias Bluebaum, while reigning World Champion D Gukesh went down to Abhimanyu Mishra of the USA — the youngest Grandmaster in chess history — in the fifth round of the FIDE Grand Swiss on Monday.On a day of mixed fortunes for the Indians, Arjun Erigaisi produced a clinical win against Russian-turned-Swiss player Nikita Vitiugov, while Parham Maghsoodloo of Iran continued his impressive run by outplaying Hungary’s Richard Rapport.Maghsoodloo, who played with the black pieces, now leads the field with 4.5 points out of a possible five. The performance marks a strong resurgence for the Iranian, who had once reached a peak rating of 2740. Chasing him closely are Arjun, Bluebaum and Mishra, all with four points each, with Nodirbek Abdusattorov still in contention to join the chasing pack.The Grand Swiss carries a total prize fund of USD 625,000 in the open section and USD 230,000 in the women’s event. Importantly, the top two finishers in both sections will earn coveted spots in the next Candidates Tournament, which will decide the challengers for the World Championship title.In the women’s section, India’s R Vaishali maintained her joint lead after drawing with Russia’s Kateryna Lagno, who is competing under the FIDE flag. The two were joined at the top by Dinara Wagner of Germany and Ulviyya Fataliyeva of Azerbaijan, all on four points after five rounds.Bluebaum, meanwhile, is enjoying the tournament of his life, registering a third consecutive victory after two early draws — with Praggnanandhaa being his biggest scalp so far. The Indian tried an offbeat opening against the Queen’s Pawn with black and kept the game balanced for a long stretch. But a slip in a minor-piece endgame proved costly, as Bluebaum seized a pawn and converted confidently after 55 moves.For Gukesh, the trouble began early. Playing the Italian Opening, he faltered as early as the 12th move, allowing Mishra to launch a sharp attack with a speculative piece sacrifice. Although Gukesh initially weathered the storm, the ensuing endgame required flawless precision. Mishra capitalised on the smallest of inaccuracies and went on to secure the biggest victory of his career in 61 moves.Arjun, in contrast, showcased superb preparation in the Catalan Opening against Vitiugov, known for his theoretical depth. The young Indian plotted a precise plan, won the black queen for two minor pieces, and then methodically shut down all counterplay to claim a resounding win.Richard Rapport (Hun, 3) lost to Parham Maghsoodloo (Iri, 4.5); Matthias Blubaum (Ger, 4) beat R Praggnanandhaa (3); Arjun Erigaisi (4) beat Nikita Vitiugov (Eng, 3); Abhimanyu Mishra (4) beat D Gukesh (3); Marcandria Maurizzi (Fra, 4) beat Vincent Keymer (Ger, 3); Nodirbek Abdusattorov (Uzb, 3) Yagiz Kaan Erdogmus (Tur, 3); Nodirbek Yakubboev (Uzb, 3.5) drew with Szymon Gumularz (Pol, 3.5); Sam Shankland (Usa, 2.5) lost to Alireza Firouzja (Fra, 3.5); Anish Giri (Ned, 2.5) Grigoriy Oparin (Usa, 2.5); Levon Aronian (3) drew with Shant Sargsyan (Arm, 2.5); Vidit Gujrathi (3) drew with Ivan Cheparinov (Bul, 3); Nihal Sarin (3.5) beat Leon Luke Mendonca (2.5); V Pranav (2.5) playing Andrey Esipenko (Fid, 2.5); Abhimanyu Puranik (3) beat Vlaldimir Fedoseev (Slo, 2); Andrei Volokitin (Ukr, 2.5) drew with P Harikrishna (2); Raunak Sadhwani (2.5) drew with Yuriy Kuzubov (Ukr, 2.5); Daniil Yuffa (Esp, 2.5) drew with Aditya Mittal (2.5); S L Narayanan (2) drew with Lu Shanglei (Chn, 2.5); Divya Deshmukh (2) lost to Shamsiddin Vakhidov ((Uzb, 3); Aryan Chopra (1.5) playing Alexander Grischuk (Fid, 1.5); Anton Korobov (Ukr, 2) beat Murali Karthikeyan (1).Women: R Vaishali (4) drew with Kateryna Lagno (Fid, 4); Antoaneta Stefanova (Bul, 3.5) drew with Afruza Khamdamova (Uzb, 3.5); Irina Bulmaga (Rou, 3) lost to Dinara Wagner (Ger, 4); Alexandra Kosteniuk (Sui, 2.5) lost to Ulviyya Fataliyeva (Aze, 4); Elina Danielian (Arm, 2.5) lost to Tan Zhongyi (Chn, 3.5); Bibisara Assaubayeva (Kaz, 3.5) beat Nurgyul Salimova (Bul, 2.5); Carissa Yip (Usa, 2.5) lost to Olga Girya (Fid, 3.5); Meruert Kamalidenova (Kaz, 2.5) drew with Dronavalli Harika (2.5); Anna Muzychuk (Ukr, 2.5) beat Vantika Agrawal (1.5).",Top seed Grandmaster R Praggnanandhaa suffered a shock defeat at the hands of Germany’s Matthias Bluebaum.

- Depay makes Dutch history -

NEW DELHI: Mikel Merino scored a hat-trick as a majestic Spain thumped Turkey 6-0 away in World Cup qualifying on Sunday, while a brilliant Florian Wirtz free-kick helped Germany beat Northern Ireland 3-1 to get their bid up and running. European champions Spain were in unstoppable form in the central Turkish city of Konya, claiming their second biggest-ever away win in World Cup qualifying as Arsenal midfielder Merino scored his first professional hat-trick.Barcelona playmaker Pedri Gonzalez opened the scoring inside six minutes and later completed the scoring, with Ferran Torres netting the visitors' other goal.The quality of Merino's strikes was remarkable, with his first coming at the end of a superb team move and his second a controlled finish from a Pedri assist. He completed his triple with a curling shot into the top corner.The one blemish on the night's work for Spain was the withdrawal of Nico Williams due to an apparent thigh injury, but Luis de la Fuente's team are already clear at the top of qualifying Group E with six points from two games.""I'm very happy for winning, to pick up six points, for doing it in this way, and for scoring three goals, which is not normal -- the first hat-trick of my career,"" said Merino.The group winners will qualify directly for the finals, with the runners-up progressing to a play-off phase.Georgia and Turkey come next on three points each, with the former beating Bulgaria 3-0 in Tbilisi thanks to goals by captain Khvicha Kvaratskhelia, Nika Gagnidze and Georges Mikautadze.Germany were under pressure after losing their opening qualifier 2-0 in Slovakia on Thursday, and it took them until the final quarter of their home meeting with Northern Ireland in Cologne before they could secure the victory.Serge Gnabry gave the hosts an early lead only for Isaac Price of West Bromwich Albion to equalise before half-time.The home fans were unhappy with Julian Nagelsmann's team, but they eventually retook the lead on 69 minutes when substitute Nadiem Amiri turned in David Raum's cross.Liverpool star Wirtz, playing in his home city, then took centre stage by converting a free-kick in style to seal Germany's first win in Group A.""We knew it was a catastrophe (in the) last game and we wanted to do things better,"" Wirtz told Germany's RTL network.""It was a good performance (which) we can definitely build on.""They and Northern Ireland both have three points, while Slovakia lead the way on six points after Tomas Rigo's late goal clinched a 1-0 victory in Luxembourg.Memphis Depay became the Netherlands' all-time top goalscorer with a brace in their 3-2 win in Lithuania in Group G.Depay, who now plays in Brazil for Corinthians, scored his 51st and 52nd international goals to move clear of Robin van Persie, with whom he had been tied in first place on half a century of strikes for the Oranje.The 31-year-old turned in Cody Gakpo's cutback for the opener before Quinten Timber netted the second goal for the Netherlands in Kaunas.They appeared to be on easy street, but Torino midfielder Gvidas Gineitis pulled one back and Edvinas Girdvainis headed in the equaliser before the break for the team ranked 143rd in the world.Depay, though, rescued the Netherlands by heading in a Denzel Dumfries cross just after the hour mark.Ronald Koeman's side have 10 points after four matches and are ahead of Poland on goal difference with a game in hand.Poland won 3-1 at home to Finland in Chorzow with Matty Cash, captain Robert Lewandowski and Jakub Kaminski netting before Benjamin Kaellman pulled one back for Finland, who are three points behind the leading duo in third.Belgium recorded a second 6-0 win in as many matches in Group J as they swept aside Kazakhstan at Anderlecht's stadium in Brussels. Kevin De Bruyne scored twice and is now his country's second-top goal-scorer of all time behind Romelu Lukaku.Jeremy Doku of Manchester City also bagged a brace, with Nicolas Raskin and Thomas Meunier netting the other goals.North Macedonia beat Liechtenstein 5-0 in the same group and they are top with 11 points from five matches, one ahead of Belgium -- who have a game in hand -- and Wales.",Mikel Merino scores a hat-trick as a majestic Spain thumped Turkey 6-0 away in World Cup qualifying.

What’s common between the three Formula E world champions

How the three World Champions fared in Formula E Season 11

Days after Oliver Rowland lifted his Formula E World Championship trophy in London this season, an interesting trend has come to the attention of Formula E and its fans. As a coincidence, all Formula E drivers who won the Mexico City E-Prix went on to win the Formula E World Championship that season, and this has been proved right for three consecutive years.Highlighting the same since 2023, a poster of three World Champions was shared on X by Formula E with the caption, “The trend continues. Each winner of the #MexicoCityEPrix from the past three seasons has gone on to become World Champion.”The special poster features 2023 Formula E World Champion Jake Dennis from Andretti, then TAG Heuer Porsche’s Pascal Wehrlein, who won in 2024, and the new World Champion, Nissan driver Oliver Rowland. All three of them won in the Mexico E-Prix and went on to lift the winner’s trophy in the Formula E World Championship that year.Oliver Rowland had strengthened his chances of winning the Formula E World Championship this year much earlier. He was leading the Formula E Driver Standings ever since he won Part 2 of the Jeddah E-Prix, which was his second win of the season after winning the Mexico E-Prix. In the last leg, the Nissan driver got nervous for a while as Pascal Wehrlein, who was following him in the number two position, closed the gap after grabbing quite a few podiums while Rowland had a dull period.Things became serious for Rowland when he failed to finish the Round 13 race in Berlin, while Wehrlein won second spot on the podium. But he eventually managed to confirm his championship in Berlin after four wins and three more podiums.Sharing about his bad race in Berlin, Rowland had said, “I was hoping before the weekend that the outcome could be [the World Championship], but after yesterday (Saturday) and this morning (Sunday), I was more worried that it might never come.”Also Read: Oliver Rowland reacts to daughter’s sweet radio message after Formula E Championship win: “It’s amazing” Things, however, changed for Wehrlein, who was pushed to third position after Nick Cassidy made a late entry in the Formula E Driver Standings by registering three consecutive wins.

Wehrlein registered one win and five more podiums this season.Meanwhile, Andretti driver Jake Dennis finished in seventh position in the Formula E Driver Standings.

Taylor Barnard on losing top three spot in Formula E World Championship

Fans hail Taylor Barnard for his fantastic rookie season

It was Taylor Barnard’s rookie season this year, and the NEOM McLaren driver put up a fantastic performance by temporarily making it to the top three in the Formula E Driver Standings by ousting the much more experienced Porsche driver Antonio Felix Da Costa.

Barnard took to Instagram to share his feelings on losing out on the top three in his first-ever season and his claim to the championship.Taking to Instagram after the London E-Prix, Barnard wrote, “London wasn’t what we hoped for, easily being the toughest weekend of our season. Taking 0 points away as a team from a doubleheader hurts, but one weekend doesn’t define the year we’ve had.”He further wrote, “As the season closes, I want to say a massive thank you to the entire team, both trackside and behind the scenes, for everything this season. Finishing P4 in the Drivers’ Championship and coming into the final weekend with a shot at runner-up is something to be proud of.”Also adding a note for teammate Sam Bird, as NEOM McLaren withdrew from Formula E after the end of the season, Barnard wrote, “@sambird_official it wasn’t the weekend you deserved either.You’ve been a huge part of my season both on and off the track, and I’m grateful for everything.

Through the early days, the good days, the bad days, and the great days, we have always felt an overwhelming amount of support from you all.”For the partners associated with the team, he wrote, “They say that ‘racing is a state of mind’, and since its inception, this team has had the privilege of working for organisations, with partners, and racing for fans who fully embrace this philosophy.This is certainly true of those at McLaren, whose passion for racing is second to none.”“My heartfelt thanks go out to everyone who has been involved: those at McLaren who backed us, the fans who supported us, and the partners who allowed us to go racing. We couldn’t have done it without you all — your trust and support have never been taken for granted,” he added.Praising the two McLaren drivers, he wrote, “Sam clinched McLaren’s first-ever fully electric win at the São Paulo E-Prix in Season 10, pulling off one of Formula E’s all-time great overtakes, before being waved across the line by none other than Emerson Fittipaldi – McLaren's first Formula 1 World Champion. While Taylor has been a rookie sensation in Season 11, securing five Formula E records, including the youngest driver to start a race, the youngest points scorer, the youngest driver to lead a lap, the youngest podium finisher, and the youngest polesitter. ”He ended the letter saying, “Some of us have been together since the day we first launched this team, while others have seamlessly fitted in along the way and flourished within the environment we have cultivated. For many, I am sure that we will cross paths again soon, but whatever the future holds for those here at Bicester, whatever path they choose to follow, I have no doubt that it will be bright.

Three wins lost in the last laps because of safety cars, a few mistakes — my mixture.

How do Formula E and ABB work together?

What do ABB and Formula E say about the partnership?

After a successful Season 11, ABB and Formula E have announced that they will continue their partnership in the upcoming season. This gives ABB another opportunity to promote its new brand positioning via the ABB FIA Formula E World Championship, along with technologies that help industries take a cleaner route.Over a period of eight seasons, the partnership with Formula E has provided ABB a platform to showcase how technology can help industries outrun challenges, engage with customers around the world, and implement its own solutions into the series to improve reliability and efficiency. The partnership extension will provide a year-round opportunity for brand-building and activation, communicating ABB and its technology solutions to new global audiences, including Formula E’s international fanbase.ABB and Formula E will also join hands to engage a new generation of fans, collaborating with unexpected influencers and content creators to tell compelling stories that make advanced electrification and automation technologies tangible and exciting.The end of the mid-race car swap, a 150kW increase in power, top speeds that are 43 percent higher, and energy recovery increasing from 15 to 50 percent indicate how far Formula E technology has come to outperform on track.ABB has also built on its technical involvement in the series, supplying the race chargers from Season 9, and introducing its ABB Ability OPTIMAX® energy management software (Season 9) and Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) technology (Season 5) to the sport.ABB Head of Brand Paco Liebrand said, “We are pleased to be continuing our partnership with Formula E which, like ABB, is striving for a leaner and cleaner future. The synergy between the two organizations, combined with the global appeal of the Championship, makes it a great platform to promote our brand positioning.”He further said, “Formula E is increasingly working with content creators, influencers, and celebrities, with initiatives such as the Evo Sessions making an impact through digital channels beyond the racing itself, which is also an essential part of ABB’s new brand strategy. Going forward, we will be enhancing the way we harness the benefits of this collaboration, ensuring the focus is on delivering content and activations that reinforce our new messaging, build familiarity, and tell the ‘Engineered to Outrun’ story. ”Formula E Chief Revenue Officer Tiziana Di Gioia said, “Our renewed partnership with ABB is a testament to the commercial power and benefit of Formula E as a global platform that drives both brand and business growth. ABB, like our wider partnership portfolio, has and continues to see enormous value in collaborating with the fastest-growing motorsport on the planet, with viewership, commercial integration, and brand storytelling continuing to accelerate. Over eight seasons, ABB has moved from brand visibility to brand activation—integrating deeply into the fan experience, the sport’s ecosystem, and our innovation narrative.Also Read: Antonio Felix Da Costa shares happy memories as Porsche wins Formula E Teams and Manufacturers’ World Championships “This next chapter elevates the partnership even further. With ABB’s new positioning, we are co-creating opportunities across content, digital storytelling, and market engagement, transforming a title partnership into a year-round, value-generating relationship. It’s a model of how modern sponsorships should evolve, rooted in purpose and cultural alignment but measured by impact,” she added.Formula E Season 12 will begin with testing in Valencia in October.","ABB and Formula E have announced that they will continue their partnership in the upcoming season.

Carlos Alcaraz capped his latest Grand Slam triumph in style on Sunday night, trading the roar of Arthur Ashe Stadium for the glitz of Manhattan nightlife. The 22-year-old Spaniard, who defeated Jannik Sinner 6-2, 3-6, 6-1, 6-4 to lift his second US Open crown and sixth major overall, was the center of attention both on and off the court.Moments after sealing victory in front of a packed house that included US President Donald Trump , Alcaraz retreated to the locker room to celebrate with his team. Armed with a champagne bottle and ready to drench his entourage, the world No. 1 instead found himself on the receiving end, as coach Juan Carlos Ferrero and others showered their star with fizz in jubilant scenes.The night didn’t end there. Alcaraz and his circle later headed to Chez Margaux, a private members-only supper club in the Meatpacking District, known for hosting celebrities from Taylor Swift to the New York Knicks. Membership at the Parisian-inspired venue comes at a premium, with annual fees ranging from $3,000 to $4,000 depending on age, plus hefty joining costs.Inside, Alcaraz was greeted by renowned chef Jean-Georges Vongerichten, who posed for photos with the champion. Models Brianna Bardhi and Tika Camaj also joined the celebrations, as the tennis star’s victory coincided with a high-profile afterparty for the VMA Awards.The club transformed into a buzzing mix of sports and entertainment, with Hollywood star Jamie Foxx in attendance, rapper Cardi B delivering a performance, and actress Lupita Nyong’o making an appearance after watching the final earlier in the day.The venue had already hosted women’s champion Aryna Sabalenka 24 hours earlier, with the Belarusian even bringing along her trophy. For Alcaraz, though, the night was about soaking in his latest achievement, enjoying a champagne-soaked reminder of his growing stature not just in tennis, but as a global star on and off the court.","Carlos Alcaraz celebrated his US Open triumph with a night out in Manhattan.

NEW DELHI: Since the start of 2024, Jannik Sinner has had a win-loss record of 110-11, 49-4 in Grand Slam matches and 68-5 on hard courts. Those are impressive numbers for anyone. Making that even more admirable is the fact that if you remove one matchup from that tally, it becomes 109-4, 48-1 and 68-1, respectively. But that matchup is one that cannot be ignored.That one matchup is the biggest rivalry in men's tennis right now, one that filled the 24,000-seater Arthur Ashe Stadium on Sunday afternoon and has now been contested for three straight major finals in a row.Sinner's battles with Carlos Alcaraz are not just spectacular matches, laden with sensational tennis and otherworldly skills, they're also contests that crown Grand Slam champions - as they have for eight majors in a row - and decide top-ranking - as it did in New York.Worryingly for the Italian, Sinner's record in the last two years has been poor against Alcaraz. Overall, he's won only once against the 22-year-old Spaniard in eight matches (at Wimbledon), coming at Wimbledon earlier in the year. On hard courts, arguably Sinner's best surface, the record stands at 0-4.This lopsided scale is reminiscent of the Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal rivalry, more specifically in 2006. That year, Federer was 44-0 in the first 48 matches against all opponents that were not the left-handed maverick.His record vs Nadal, though, was 0-4.Much like Federer did with Nadal at multiple stages in his career, Sinner is aware of the challenge posed by the newly crowned World No. 1 Alcaraz. Moreover, he accepted that something has to change.“I was very predictable on court today. He changed up the game. That’s also his style of how he plays. Now it’s gonna be on me if I want to make changes or not. We’re definitely gonna work on that,” said Sinner in the post-match press conference.“I didn’t make one serve and volley. I didn’t use a lot of drop shots. Then you arrive at the point where you have to play Carlos, you have to go out of the comfort zone.""I’m gonna aim… maybe even lose some matches from now on, but trying to do some changes. To be a bit more unpredictable as a player. That’s what I have to do, trying to become a better tennis player. At the end of the day that’s my main goal,” continued Sinner.To be fair to Sinner, Alcaraz, who was labelled a 'servebot' during the Wimbledon final run, was more lethal on the serve this time around. He didn't drop a single set enroute to the final. In the title match, he hit 10 aces and won 83% of his first-serve points.Remarkably, Alcaraz was broken just three times throughout the fortnight. For context, the fewest times he's been broken during a Grand Slam-winning run was 11 at Wimbledon in 2023.Sinner, in comparison, struggled with his serve and made numerous uncharacteristic errors. He made just 48% of his first serves, served four double faults, hit 21 winners (vs Alcaraz's 42) and struck 28 unforced errors (vs Alcaraz's 24).Alcaraz vs Sinner has been labelled a duopoly in men's tennis with comparisons being drawn with Federer vs Nadal and Martina Navratilova vs Chris Evert . The gulf between the two and the rest has been made clear repeatedly and there exists a near 5,000-ranking points difference with the World No. 3 Alexander Zverev.With that in consideration, it would be no surprise if Sinner tries to mend his game to counter Alcaraz's style. The Italian's approach is to hit through the ball, power past the opponent and with conditions not suitable for that on the covered Arthur Ashe Stadium, he couldn't make inroads. Alcaraz, meanwhile, is someone who has plenty of shots in his arsenal - he can out-hit the opponent, he can find the angles, he can go cross court and maybe the biggest weapon are the audacious drop shots out of nowhere.“This is the ultimate test for Jannik Sinner, and it looks like it’s going to be for quite a while,” Chanda Rubin said on Tennis Channel. “The problems that Alcaraz presents, and how he can disrupt play and how he can keep Sinner off balance. Now, it’s on Sinner to see what he can add and continue to improve.”With Chapter 15 of the rivalry in the books, it will be interesting how Sinner recovers from this and dusts himself off for the next meeting - wherever and whenever that might be.","Jannik Sinner lost to Carlos Alcaraz in the men's singles final of the US Open. Sinner has a win-loss record of 110-11, 49-4 in Grand Slam matches and 68-5 on hard courts. The Italian has won only once against the 22-year-old Spaniard in eight matches (at Wimbledon), coming at Wimbledon earlier this year.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123768651,imgsize-110862,width-400,resizemode-4/us-open.jpg"

Sinners | I Lied To You Song | Movie Clip | Warner Bros. Entertainment

Serve Both Dreams

Era-defining Rivalry

A glimpse of the future

Sinners is one of the finest, most original movies to come out of Hollywood in years, a reminder of the kind of storytelling that once made the film industry the West’s most powerful propaganda machine before it became a supply chain for woke sermonising, superhero assembly lines and staid sequels.Ryan Coogler’s masterpiece with frequent collaborator Michael B. Jordan is a horror-musical set in Jim Crow-era Mississippi, where Black communities endure segregation, endless work shifts, white supremacists moonlighting as Klan members, dubious currency systems, garlic-based assaults on the tastebuds, and Irish vampires who are as likely to break into dance as a Bollywood extra.At the heart of the story is Sammy Moore, a young Blues musician so gifted that his music can pierce the veil between life and death, summoning spirits of the past and visions of the future.The leitmotif is captured in the film’s most famous sequence: the surreal montage where Moore’s guitar and voice conjure shamans and African dancers from centuries past, and at the same time foreshadow electric guitar gods like Jimi Hendrix, beatboxers, and modern-day DJs.On Sunday at Arthur Ashe, it wasn’t Moore but Carlos Alcaraz against Jannik Sinner who conjured spirits of tennis legends from the past and gave us a glimpse of its future. In one performance he conjured Pete Sampras’ serve, Andre Agassi’s counter-fighting, Rafa Nadal’s feral scrambling, Novak Djokovic ’s elastic contortions and Stefan Edberg’s composure at the net – all being composed from Alcaraz’s magical racket.And it wasn’t against a journeyman. It was Sinner — his necessary antagonist, the man with the same résumé but a different destiny. The rival who humbled him on Centre Court at Wimbledon, the rival he had to summon every spirit to beat in Paris.In the semifinal, Alcaraz had already given Federer fans a serious case of déjà vu by dismantling Novak Djokovic in the same way the Swiss maestro took apart Andre Agassi twenty years ago.Leading up to the tournament, Carlos Alcaraz had expressed his desire to become a serve bot, an almost meme-fied term in contemporary tennis.In tennis slang, a “serve bot” is a player whose game is built almost entirely around the serve. Think John Isner or Ivo Karlovic — thunderous aces, hold after hold, but little ability to break back. Analysts even gave it a formula: break less than 10% of the time and you’re officially a bot. Once an insult, younger players began reclaiming it, posting speed-gun readings on Instagram, joking about being “bots for a day” after hitting double-digit aces.Alcaraz leaned into the meme earlier this season, scribbling “Am I a serve bot?” on a courtside camera in Melbourne after pounding down 14 aces in a second-round win. But everyone knew he wasn’t. His genius came in rallies, improvisation, point construction. He could win Slams without a bazooka delivery.Until now.At the 2025 US Open, the “serve bot” fantasy became part-reality. Not because Alcaraz reduced himself to one-dimensional serving, but because he added that dimension to an already encyclopaedic arsenal. In the final, he fired 10 aces, produced no double faults, landed 61% first serves, and won a staggering 83% of those points. Across the tournament, he held serve in 98 of 101 games — a 97% clip that puts him in Pete Sampras territory. And he did it while defending like Nadal and counter-attacking like Djokovic. Rafael Nadal once spoke of how Carlos Alcaraz was magic but at times he got carried away, trying to be perfect. It was a flaw, that the Spaniard ironed out in 2025. He combined his flair with discipline, not dropping a set until the final and lost serve only thrice all fortnight. He racked up 42 winners in the championship match while keeping errors to 24, more than doubling Sinner’s winner tally. He trusted his patterns, yet sprinkled in disguise: kick serves to pull Sinner wide, sliced backhands to disrupt rhythm, feathered drops when least expected.And crucially, he stayed calm. When Sinner threatened in the fourth set, when two match points vanished, Alcaraz smiled, reset, and belted a 134-mph serve followed by a swaggering overhead. It was the composure of a man who knows the moment belongs to him.If you prefer numbers to vibes, the fortnight’s dominance can be measured with ruthless clarity.Alcaraz won 98 of his 101 service games, conceding just three breaks in seven matches, and dropped only a single set — in the final. Against Sinner, he finished with a winner-to-error differential of +18 (42–24), while his rival slumped to –7 (21–28). He broke Sinner’s serve five times, something no one had managed on hard courts in more than a year. And at just 22, he now stands on six Grand Slam titles across all three surfaces, making him the youngest man in history to secure multiple majors on clay,Sinner admitted as much afterwards: against Alcaraz, you have to leave the comfort zone. You have to become unpredictable, even if it means more defeats along the way. That isn’t a knock on him; it’s the inevitability of a march to greatness.Federer needed Nadal to torment him on clay. Nadal needed Djokovic to puncture inevitability. Djokovic needed both to harden his steel. Agassi and Sampras burned each other into relevance. Alcaraz needs Sinner — the orderly counterweight that forces chaos to its sharpest, most devastating form.If this is 22, what will 25 look like? The future hinted at in New York is a Spaniard destined to be an albatross around the neck of every rival.And to return to our original premise, Sinners is based on the legend of Robert Johnson: a man who ostensibly sold his soul to the Devil at the crossroads for the gift of becoming the world’s first rock star. Tennis doesn’t deal in pacts with Satan, but watching Alcaraz, you’d be forgiven for thinking he’d either shaken hands with God or made a Faustian deal with his opposite number.Which brings us to another musician of note — Mick Jagger , who sang:“Just as every cop is a criminalAnd all the sinners saintsAs heads is tails, just call me Lucifer’Cause I’m in need of some restraint”That’s where Sinner comes in. Maybe his path is to shed restraint, just as Nadal once did to topple Federer. Because to push Alcaraz, he will have to unlearn the saint within — the metronome that beats everyone else into submission — and find a way to disturb the séance.","Carlos Alcaraz beat Jannik Sinner in the 2025 US Open final.

Once celebrated as tennis' ""people's slam,"" the US Open has transformed into a high-octane lifestyle carnival — where attending is less about the sport and more about being seen sipping a $23 Honey Deuce or Instagramming a $100 plate of caviar-topped chicken nuggets.Every August, New York's final Grand Slam rolls into Queens with a spectacle that now extends far beyond forehands and backhands. Fans parade their consumption: lobster rolls at $40, gourmet ramen shrimp scampi, rye cookies, and above all, the Honey Deuce cocktail — a vodka-lemonade mix adorned with frozen honeydew ""tennis balls"" — now an unmistakable symbol of the Open.In 2023 alone, CNBC reported over 550,000 Honey Deuce cocktails sold, generating $13 million. Despite six price hikes since 2012, its popularity has soared, a phenomenon dubbed ""funflation"" — where Americans, even while complaining about grocery prices, splurge on experiences.If Wimbledon's strawberries and cream represent understated tradition, Flushing Meadows has leaned into over-the-top indulgence.Michelin-starred chef Simon Kim, whose Korean steakhouse Coqodaq dazzles Manhattan's elite, was invited to bring his creations to the Open. His much-talked-about ""caviar nuggets"" embody the fusion of highbrow and lowbrow. ""Chicken nugget is the most common food. Caviar is the highest brow. We mixed the two to make something special that's available to everybody,"" Kim told CBS.The menu also includes Gangnam-style chicken sandwiches and mango mahi tacos. Supplier Pat Lafrieda explained, ""Food is reflective of the city — beef, chicken, pasta, ramen, Japanese — it's variety that mirrors New York itself.""But the food spectacle has spiraled into a sideshow. New York Post reported groups stacking Honey Deuce cups into towers around stadiums, turning the Open into a frat-style carnival.Even players are leaning into the culture. Jessica Pegula posted a selfie with the cocktail after her semifinal loss, while doubles finalist Taylor Townsend swigged one at her press conference. The drink, much like the mint julep at the Kentucky Derby, is now synonymous with the Open.What was once an accessible celebration of tennis now feels like a cultural festival where the price tags themselves are part of the spectacle. The Guardian described it as the ""Coachella-fication"" of tennis: celebrities, influencers, fashion trends, and Instagram posts often overshadow the actual sport.For purists, Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner dueling for supremacy might remain the main draw. But for many at Flushing Meadows, the main story of the US Open lies in the carnival of consumption — where caviar on nuggets and vodka in collectible cups take center stage.","The US Open has transformed into a high-octane lifestyle carnival.

Carlos Alcaraz wore different smiles at the Arthur Ashe Stadium. Sometimes he grinned, dazzled by his own brilliance. Other times, he beamed, swept up in the energy of a crowd with whom he shares an electric connection everywhere he goes, but especially in New York City, home to 2.42 million Hispanics. And then there were the quieter moments, when he stared into the stands, shook his racket, and let a slow smile rise to his lips.The atmosphere crackled. Most of the crowd looked like they had shown up for the Alcaraz Sunday Show, and he did not disappoint. Spike Lee jumped to his feet, applauding the Spaniard. Steph Curry simply raised his arms, a nod to the masterclass unfolding on the court. Jimmy Connors pushed back in his seat, and Stefan Edberg leaned in.Then, when it was done—6–2, 3–6, 6–1, 6–4 in two hours and 42 minutes—Alcaraz dropped to his haunches and laughed. It was a hearty expression. The Spaniard’s methodical annihilation of defending champion Jannik Sinner in the US Open final sealed his return to the No. 1 ranking for the first time since September 2023.“It was one of the first goals I had during the season, to try to recover the No.1 as soon as possible or end the year as the No.1,” Alcaraz said. “For me, to achieve that once again is a dream. Doing that on the same day as winning another Grand Slam feels even better.”What Alcaraz produced on Sunday at Flushing Meadows to notch his 13th straight win was something Sinner was not prepared for. He ripped forehands cross-court, shifted angles by the slightest margins to catch his opponent just short, and served at near-manic speeds. Sinner managed just 10 points off Alcaraz’s first serve in the match.Alcaraz’s intense focus during the US hardcourt swing was fueled by his gripping rivalry with Sinner. The 22-year-old did not just react to his loss in the Wimbledon final to Sinner; he responded to it. On that English summer evening two months ago, Alcaraz lost to a player who was not just more solid on the day. Sinner played Alcaraz’s own shots and played them better.After a week’s break in July, the Spaniard returned to the practice courts. He worked on his consistency, learned to discipline his shot selection, drawing from an outrageous range, and added bite to his serve before heading to Cincinnati.“Right after the Wimbledon final, I thought I needed to improve some specific things if I wanted to beat him,” Alcaraz said. “I spent two weeks before Cincinnati just practicing some things.”“I studied the Wimbledon final with my coaches. We spoke about what we could have done better in that match when I face him another time. We noted everything and we worked on it. In the beginning, we thought it did not matter if he won or I won. I just wanted to do the right things. If I did the right things and he played an unbelievable match, it was okay, but at least I did the right things.”Sinner came into the final with a hard-court Grand Slam record of 27-0. It was not lost on Alcaraz and his team. On his return to competition in Cincinnati, Alcaraz, who has a tendency to drift in and out of matches like a weak radio signal, charged to the title, dropping just two sets along the way. In New York, he lost only one set, to Sinner in the final.Jannik Sinner’s US Open campaign had been a struggle, not because of inexperience, but because he dropped a couple of sets en route to the final. In the semifinals against Felix Auger-Aliassime, he appeared out of sorts and needed medical attention for what he later described as a twitch.On Sunday, playing his fifth successive major final, Sinner was outsmarted by Alcaraz in four sets. The 24-year-old Italian, who had not been at his best physically throughout the tournament, vowed to be less predictable with his play going forward even if it came at the cost of some matches.“I was very predictable today on court. He did many things, he changed his game. That's also his style, how he plays,” Sinner said. “Now it's going to be on me if I want to make changes or not. We are definitely going to work on that.”Sinner also said that his run to the final showed how much he needed to push out of his comfort zone against a player like Alcaraz. “When you always do the same things like I did during this tournament, I didn't make one serve-volley, didn't use a lot of drop shots, and then you arrive at a point where you play against Carlos where you have to go out of the comfort zone,” he said.“I'm going to aim, maybe even if I lose some matches from now on, to try to make some changes, trying to be a bit more unpredictable,” Sinner added.“For sure, my serve today was not on point. I felt I was struggling a lot today, but it was already struggling during the tournament,” he said. “One secret is also patience. It's not like in Beijing I'm going to be a lefty.”Sunday’s loss ended Sinner’s 65-week reign at the top of the ATP rankings. “I'm going to change a couple of things on the serve, just small things, but they can make big differences,” he said. “Then we see how it goes. I'm looking forward to playing these matches again. It’ll be new since I'm not No. 1 anymore. It changes a little bit when you chase.”The last time Alcaraz found himself in a similar position—falling short in a match he desperately wanted to win—was 12 months ago after losing the gold medal clash to Novak Djokovic at the Paris Olympics. The 22-year-old also lost in the second round of the US Open to Botic van Zandschulp and managed to win only one tournament two months later in Beijing. His next title came in Rotterdam in February, but it was not until Monte Carlo in April that he truly found his rhythm again.In New York, Alcaraz took a page out of Sinner’s book and returned the compliment the Italian had paid him at Wimbledon. But the Spaniard did not mirror Sinner’s consistency and efficiency. He simply sharpened his own game, increasing his precision.The final, already a historic affair since Alcaraz and Sinner became the first players in the Open Era to contest three Grand Slam title matches in the same season, got off to a delayed start due to the arrival of President Donald Trump Alcaraz broke Sinner in the opening game to set the tone for the match. The 24-year-old raised hopes in the second set, but the dissonance in his play throughout New York, not just in the final, began to surface. When he broke in the second game of the third set, he looked very much in charge again, bullying the Italian with his power and placement.",Carlos Alcaraz beats Jannik Sinner in four sets to win US Open title.

President Donald Trump ’s appearance at the US Open 2025 men’s singles final between Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner caused a stir, overshadowing what was meant to be a thrilling tennis showdown. Fans at the Arthur Ashe Stadium expressed their displeasure loudly, booing the 79-year-old leader as he attended the match.Trump’s unannounced presence delayed the match by nearly 50 minutes. Security measures to accommodate him caused long queues and left thousands of fans unable to enter the arena even after play had begun at the Billie Jean King National Tennis Center. The delay frustrated both spectators and players, putting an unexpected spotlight on the political figure rather than the high-octane final.Adding to the controversy, former British tennis player Laura Robson may have breached media guidelines during the broadcast. The United States Tennis Association had instructed all broadcasters to avoid showing or commenting on reactions to Trump’s attendance.According to a Dailymail report, Robson, working as a pundit for Sky Sports, highlighted the crowd’s reaction when Trump appeared on the big screen.“They’ve just shown Trump on the big screen, lots of boos,” she remarked. The USTA has not commented on Robson’s coverage so far.Robson, born in 1994, is a former British professional tennis player. She made her junior circuit debut in 2007 and won the Junior Wimbledon championship at age 14. She reached the Australian Open girls’ singles finals in 2009 and 2010 and claimed her first ITF Women’s Circuit tournament in 2008. In Grand Slam events, Robson’s career highlights included reaching the fourth round at Wimbledon in 2013 and the US Open in 2012. At the 2012 London Olympics, she won a mixed doubles gold medal partnering Andy Murray.Robson faced a series of injuries between 2014 and 2015 and, despite returning in 2016, she could not regain form and retired in 2018 at the age of 28. Since then, she has stayed connected to the sport, including working in media.In the tennis final itself, Carlos Alcaraz emerged victorious, defeating world No.1 Jannik Sinner 6-2, 3-6, 6-1, 6-4 to claim the US Open men’s singles crown. While the match delivered on sporting drama, Trump’s attendance and the ensuing chaos became the main talking point for many fans.","Trump’s unannounced presence delayed the match by nearly 50 minutes.

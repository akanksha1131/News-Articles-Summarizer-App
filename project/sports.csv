Virat Kohli retires from Test cricket after 14 years

'Iyer a caring captain'

JAIPUR: Virat Kohli made the biggest impact on the Test stage and the format will sorely miss him, feels former Australia cricketer Brad Haddin, now assistant coach of Punjab Kings.Former wicketkeeper-batter Haddin, who had some heated exchanges with Kohli in the past, says Kohli’s passion for the high-stakes moments made him stand out.""It was just his willingness to compete,"" Haddin told TOI in an exclusive interaction. ""Kohli was a once-in-a-generation player and he changed the way the game was played with how he presented himself physically. The thing that drew Australians to Kohli was his sheer passion for the big moments.""He enjoyed coming up against teams like Australia, South Africa and England when they were at their peak and it brought the best out of him,"" Haddin said.Kohli’s captaincy debut in the 2014 Adelaide Test was marked by confrontations with both Mitchell Johnson and Haddin. The batter responded with twin centuries to showcase his resilience and dogged ability to chase victory, though India eventually faltered.""He’s going to be sorely missed in Test cricket. I think that was his greatest format, where he had the biggest impact,"" Haddin said.Haddin, who has been with the Punjab Kings franchise since 2022, also praised captain Shreyas Iyer for his leadership role.""One thing that impressed me is his care for his playing group. He’s got a really clear message in what he delivers to the players and he lives those habits all the time. The players got an enormous amount of respect for him,"" Haddin said.Haddin also highlighted the strong partnership between head coach Ricky Ponting and Iyer, saying, ""They’ve had a great relationship since their time in Delhi. They work well together.""",Brad Haddin says retired stalwart left his biggest imprint on the five-day game.

'Shubman Gill used his brains a lot more than the other guys'

AHMEDABAD: The results might not be going in their favour but the Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) openers have ensured swift, solid starts at the top of the order. This season, openers Aiden Markram and Mitchell Marsh have shared five half-century alliances and one 100-run partnership.On Thursday against the Gujarat Titans here, Markram (36 off 24b; 3x4, 2x6) and Marsh (117 off 64b; 10x4, 8x6) again provided the fireworks, and along with Nicholas Pooran (56 off 27b; 4x4, 5x6), powered the visitors to a formidable 235/2.In reply, GT could only manage 202/9, with the in-form top order failing to carry the game deep. Eventually it fell to Shahrukh Khan (57 off 29; 5x4, 3x6) and Sherfane Rutherford to make a match of it, but GT eventually fell short by 33 runs, folding for 202/9. The star of the show with the ball for LSG was Will O' Rourke (3/27), who got rid of Sai Sudharsan upfront and then Rutherford and Tewatia. Avesh Khan and Ayush Badoni too got among the wickets. LSG have now defeated GT both times this season.O'Rourke had Sudharsan caught by Markram at mid-off while Avesh (2/51) got Gill caught brilliantly by Abdul Samad at long-off. Jos Buttler (33 off 18b, 3x4, 2x6) threatened for a while to break loose but was deceived by left-arm pacer Akash Singh's slow inswinger and was bowled.The untested Titans middle-order of Rutherford (38 off 22b; 1x4, 3x6) and Shahrukh showed promise, with the duo adding 86 runs for the fourth wicket.With 54 runs needed off 24 balls, the Titans smelt a chance. But, once O' Rourke had Rutherford caught at deep midwicket by substitute fielder Ravi Bishnoi, the rest of the Titans' innings just petered out.Earlier, Marsh and Markram got off the blocks quickly as LSG reached 22 after two overs. Three sedate overs followed before Markram took the toll off Kagiso Rabada by smashing him for two sixes over the leg-side boundary as the visitors raced to 53 in the Powerplay.The introduction of GT's best pacer, Prasidh Krishna and left-arm spinner R Sai Kishore did little to stem the scoring rate. Marsh got into the act, hitting the left-arm spinner for two maximums and smashing the pacer over square leg for six. Markram's one such attempted lofted shot off Sai Kishore, however, saw him lose his wicket, caught at long off by M Shahrukh Khan.Subsequently, leggie Rashid Khan was smashed for 25 in an over as Marsh deposited the short balls on offer to the leg-side boundary. Siraj engaged in a verbal duel with Pooran but ended up leaking 20 off the 16th over. Marsh reached his first IPL century with a single to point in the 17th over. Even the off-colour Rishabh Pant (16 off 6b; 2x6) chipped in with a useful contribution.","Mitchell Marsh and Aiden Markram top score for Lucknow Super Giants with 117.

Bombay Sport Exchange Ep 5: Shane Watson on how IPL gave him a lifeline & his tribute to Phil Hughes

England's dominance on the opening day of their one-off Test against Zimbabwe at Trent Bridge was not just about the scoreboard. It was a day etched in record books, with Joe Root surpassing Jacques Kallis to become the fastest to 13,000 Test runs, and England's top three – Zak Crawley, Ben Duckett and Ollie Pope – all scoring centuries in a merciless display of ‘Bazball' batting.Root, who needed 28 runs to reach the coveted mark, achieved the feat in his 153rd Test, eclipsing Kallis' previous record of 159 Tests. The 34-year-old reached the milestone with a single off Victor Nyauchi in the 80th over. Though his innings ended shortly after on 34, caught off a short ball from Blessing Muzarabani, Root became only the fifth batter in history to breach 13,000 Test runs.Root now trails only Sachin Tendulkar (15,921), Ricky Ponting (13,378), Jacques Kallis (13,289), and Rahul Dravid (13,288), with Tendulkar's record within striking distance.But Root's achievement was only one highlight in a day overflowing with batting milestones.Ben Duckett and Zak Crawley tormented a young Zimbabwean bowling attack, sharing a 231-run opening stand – England's highest at home since 1960.Duckett, playing at his home ground, brought up his fifth Test ton with a 134-ball 140, while Crawley ended a lean patch with a fluent 124 – his first hundred in 28 innings.Ollie Pope then continued the onslaught, racing to 169* off 163 balls by stumps. His innings marked his third consecutive century at Trent Bridge and helped England finish on a staggering 498/3 – their highest ever opening-day total at home.For the first time since Rawalpindi 2022, England's top three all registered hundreds on the same day, underscoring the firepower of their aggressive Test approach. While Zimbabwe entered the contest buoyed by a recent win over Bangladesh, the gulf in class was evident throughout the day.","Joe Root becomes fastest to 13,000 Test runs.

Lucknow Super Giants secured a consolation 33-run victory over Gujarat Titans in Ahmedabad on Thursday, powered by Mitchell Marsh's maiden IPL century of 117 runs off 64 balls. The win prevented GT from sealing a top-two spot in the league table, as LSG posted 235 for 2 in their 20 overs while restricting GT to 202 for 9.Mitchell Marsh's innings featured 10 fours and eight sixes, forming the backbone of LSG's impressive total. He partnered with Aiden Markram for a 91-run opening stand and later added 121 runs with Nicholas Pooran in just 8.3 overs.Nicholas Pooran continued his strong form, scoring his fifth half-century of the season in 23 balls, finishing with an unbeaten 56 off 27 deliveries. Markram contributed 36 runs off 24 balls to the team's cause. LSG's batting performance included a record 17 sixes in an IPL match. Marsh, who started slowly, showed exceptional control in hitting both straight and square off the wicket using his reach.Will O'Rourke, who replaced Mayank Yadav in the LSG squad, emerged as the standout bowler with figures of 3 for 27.Gujarat Titans' chase began promisingly with Sai Sudharsan scoring 21 off 16 balls and captain Shubman Gill making 35 off 20 balls. However, both openers failed to convert their starts into substantial innings, falling before the close of the 8th over.Jos Buttler contributed 33 runs off 18 balls before falling to a clever delivery from Akash Singh, who managed to bowl despite injuring and bleeding from his right hand.Shahrukh Khan and Sherfane Rutherford provided hope for GT with an explosive 86-run partnership in just 6.4 overs. Shahrukh scored 57 off 29 balls while Rutherford made 38, but their efforts proved insufficient against the large target. LSG's bowling attack faced some pressure as Akash Deep and Shahbaz Ahmed struggled to contain runs. The team's ground fielding also showed room for improvement.Gujarat Titans, despite already qualifying for the playoffs, missed an opportunity to secure 20 points and strengthen their position in the top two. They will now need to win their final match to maintain their chances of a top-two finish.Punjab Kings and Royal Challengers Bangalore remain in contention for the top position, making the final league matches crucial for playoff positioning.Marsh's century came off 56 balls, with particularly aggressive batting against R Sai Kishore, who had previously been economical in the tournament.

England's top three batsmen - Zak Crawley Ben Duckett , and Ollie Pope - each scored centuries on Thursday's opening day of the four-day Test against Zimbabwe at Trent Bridge, Nottingham. England dominated the day, finishing at 498 for three, with Pope unbeaten on 169 in Zimbabwe's first Test match in England in 22 years.Pope's impressive innings, his fourth score above 150 in Test cricket, highlighted the significant difference in quality between the two teams.Duckett excelled on his home ground with 140, while opening partner Crawley contributed 124, marking the first time since December 2022 in Rawalpindi against Pakistan that England's top three all reached centuries on day one of a Test.Crawley's century was particularly notable as he had struggled recently, scoring just 212 runs in his previous eight Tests at an average of 15.14.The Zimbabwe bowling attack faced additional challenges when Richard Ngarava, their most effective pace bowler with figures of 0-42 in nine overs, left the field after lunch due to back and hamstring issues.Zimbabwe captain Craig Ervine chose to bowl first after winning the toss, hoping to capitalize on the cloudy conditions at Trent Bridge, known for favouring pace bowlers.The decision to field was influenced by Zimbabwe's recent 138-run defeat to a County Select XI in their only warm-up match.Despite occasional sharp deliveries, Zimbabwe's pace quartet struggled with their line and length, allowing England to reach 130 without loss at lunch.Duckett reached his century off exactly 100 balls, including 15 fours, and later added a six against Tanaka Chivanga, who conceded 83 runs in his 12 overs.His innings ended when he chipped a ball to Ben Curran at cover off spinner Wessly Madhevere, after hitting the previous two deliveries for four and six.The opening partnership of 231 was England's first century stand since Duckett and Crawley's 109 against Ireland at Lord's in 2023.Crawley, despite suffering from apparent cramp, achieved his century off 145 balls with 12 boundaries before being dismissed lbw by Sikandar Raza.Pope continued his remarkable record by becoming the first batsman to score his first eight Test hundreds against different opponents.Joe Root's dismissal for 34, caught off Blessing Muzarabani, barely impacted England's dominant position.England captain Ben Stokes made his return to cricket in this match following an extended recovery period from a hamstring injury.","England's top three batsmen - Zak Crawley Ben Duckett and Ollie Pope - each scored centuries on Thursday's opening day of the four-day Test against Zimbabwe.

Brazil vs. Argentina is one of the most famous and fiercely contested rivalries in football history. Over a century old, this South American rivalry has produced legendary players, unforgettable matches, and a competition that stretches beyond the pitch. By March 2025, Argentina had edged ahead in the all-time winners' list, a seismic shift in the balance of this long-standing rivalry.Their their latest encounter, Argentina beat Brazil 4-1 at the Estadio Monumental in Buenos Aires on March 25, 2025. It was during the 2026 World Cup qualifiers.

Significantly, it was Argentina who lifted the 2021 Copa América after a 1-0 final victory against Brazil at Maracanã Stadium, which marked Argentina's first trophy in 28 years.In addition, Argentina's continuity is already a powerful team in world football.Here's a comparison of Argentina and Brazil's major international football titles (as of May 2025):Argentina: 23 Major TitlesTotal: 23 major international trophiesBrazil: 20 Major TitlesTotal: 20 major international trophiesBrazil has won five World Cups, which is still a record.

Ever since, though, Brazil has had a difficult time asserting its dominance in this rivalry.Not only did last week's 4-1 loss in Buenos Aires highlight Argentina's rise, it also came with major consequences after last week's match for Brazil. This defeat also led to the sacking of Brazil's head coach, Dorival Júnior.

Allegations of psychological abuse against Ben Yedder

Ben Yedder’s previous legal issues and current career

Prosecutors are asking for an eight-month suspended prison sentence and a €100,000 fine for French footballer Wissam Ben Yedder, who is facing potential legal consequences. These are related to accusations of psychological violence against his separated wife, whom he is divorcing. The appeal, which is being held in Nice, has been put on hold until 3 September 2025, when a final ruling is due.The lawsuit is based on a complaint made by Ben Yedder's wife in February 2024, in which she accused him of ‘mental violence’ during their marriage. The allegations include threats of physical violence, economic abuse, and an insulated suite of insults, humiliation, and intimidation, according to reports.Those actions, prosecutors said, caused the victim psychological harm. Ben Yedder has denied all the allegations made against him, and his lawyers have demanded his acquittal, claiming the allegations are baseless.This is not Ben Yedder's first brush with the law. He was also sentenced in November 2024, to two years suspended for the rape of a woman when he was drunk. This charge came from September 2024, where he was charged for groping a woman and having s*x with her inside his car.Ben Yedder admitted to drink-driving but claimed he did not recall the attack due to his drunken state. He was also sentenced to a fine of €5,000, a six-month driving license suspension, and to pay the victim €6,500 damages.

The controversy that sparked global debate

""a little with the head of Maradona and a little with the hand of God,""

A symbol of national pride and political undertones

""The goal was as if we had beaten a country, not just a football team. This was our revenge"".

In a quarter-final World Cup match between Argentina and England in the Estadio Azteca, on June 22, 1986, in Mexico City, Diego Maradona scored a goal that would later become one of the most controversial moments in sports history. The ""Hand of God"", as it was later called, and the ""Goal of the Century"", as felicitated by FIFA, not only put Argentina on the path to a 2-1 win, but they also left an indelible mark on football folklore.With the game 0-0 till the 51st minute, England's Steve Hodge cleared the ball, and it went up and over his own penalty area. Maradona outleapt the 6-foot-1-inch English goalkeeper Peter Shilton and seemed to guide the ball into the net with his left hand, standing just 5 feet 5 inches. The Argentines maintained the advantage thanks to the referee's lack of line-of-sight to the incident and the absence of a video review system (nonexistent at the time), despite protests by England players.Maradona later described the goal asa phrase that would forever be associated with the incident from fans around the globe.Off the field of play, the ""Hand of God"" goal had greater relevance for the Argentine people, being witnessed only four years after the Falklands War between Argentina and the United Kingdom.Maradona himself acknowledged the political importance of scoring that goal, writing in his autobiography,To most Argentinians, it was a piece of poetic justice, and a source of national pride, and it took Maradona into the realms of a cultural icon.Also Read: Judge's impartiality questioned in Maradona death case, trial suspended The contest remained an exhibition of brilliance from Maradona, who added a second four minutes later with five English players once again playing off with the ball by voted the ""Goal of the Century"" by FIFA in 2002. Argentina would then go on to win the tournament, and Maradona’s exploits in the tournament cemented his reputation as one of the best footballers of all time.And it still stands as one of the iconic moments in football's history, a moment that represents the perfect blend of fair play, national pride, and human frailty that makes the game the addictive spectacle it is.","Diego Maradona's ""Hand of God"" goal was voted the ""Goal of the Century"" by FIFA in 2002.

First ever podium finish for Dan Ticktum

Dan Ticktum couldn’t hide his emotions after securing the first podium finish of his Formula E career, coming home third at the Tokyo E-Prix Round 9 on Sunday. The race was won by Nissan’s Oliver Rowland, who took a significant step closer to clinching the world championship title. Ticktum, driving for Cupra Kiro, was visibly elated after the race and shared a heartfelt message with his team over the radio.“Very good, gentlemen. Great job. Well done, everyone. I am so happy for you guys, I really am. Everyone doubts me, but I’m going to start proving them wrong. That’s nice. Many drivers are giving me thumbs up—how lovely. Right, I want a beer,” he said over the team radio.Sharing his feelings after the podium win, Dan Ticktum said: “It feels pretty good! I’m already like ‘if we had done this or done that’ I could have won, but I’m very happy overall and it’s a big boost for the team. I just don’t feel like we’ve ever had a breakthrough this season and that’s it. We’re really competing consistently at the top now across all conditions and the team executed a pretty flawless weekend - so I’m happy.”Talking further about the Tokyo race, he added, “There’s not a huge amount I could have done, there was quite a long time when I was forced to lead which was obviously not ideal, and then when me and Pascal [Wehrlein] went to take Attack Mode, Oli [Rowland] got in between us. I don’t know what more we could have done from our side really, just different strategies and it didn’t quite work out for P1 or P2, but ‘Driver of the Day’, I’ll take that - I thought everyone hated me! I’m happy, it’s good, thank you to everyone who voted for me, I appreciate it.”Also Read: Tokyo E-Prix Round 8 results: Stoffel Vandoorne clinches long-awaited win in wet conditions; Oliver Rowland finishes second Ticktum secured third place after capitalizing on Taylor Barnard’s late crash, which opened the door for the Briton to seal a well-deserved and memorable podium finish.

Formula E Drivers on racing in wet conditions

The excitement is building ahead of the next Formula E race as Japan gets ready to host the second season of the Tokyo E-Prix. But the weather forecast shows a 100 percent chance of rainfall on both Saturday and Sunday. This is enough to concern the Formula E drivers, as—despite the much-improved Gen3 Evo cars this year running on Hankook tyres—racing in rain comes with hard-to-overcome challenges and risks. However, the rain may skip the Round 9 race Sunday evening. Here’s the complete weather forecast for the Tokyo Formula E race.According to Metcheck.com, the weather in Tokyo is expected to remain pleasant at 21 degrees Celsius on Friday, though it will be a cloudy day. There are only slight chances of rain as the Formula E drivers take part in the First Free Practice session at 4 pm (local time) and 12:30 pm IST.The temperature will remain in the range of 18–20 degrees Celsius on Saturday. However, there is a 100 percent chance of rain throughout the day. Rain in the range of 2.6 mm to 3.3 mm is expected during the Second Free Practice at 8 am (local time) and the Qualifying race at 10:20 am (local time). The rain is expected to be much lighter, at 0.9 mm, during the main Round 8 race at 3:05 pm (local time), which will be broadcast in India at 11:35 am.The temperature will be in the range of 19–20 degrees Celsius on Sunday, while the rain will continue to be as heavy as the day before. There is a 100 percent chance of around 3.8 mm of rain during the Third Free Practice at 8 am (local time) and the Round 9 Qualifying at 10:20 am. But the good news is that no rain is predicted for the main Round 9 race, which will start at 3:05 pm (local time) and 11:35 am IST.Mitch Evans told RacingNews365.com that it was “very, very tricky” to race in wet conditions with the Hankook tyres in the recent races. He said, “In qualifying it was like, I was terrible. Nothing, you can't wake them [the tyres] up. In the race I was way more comfortable from the start, but the pace difference between me and some other guys was huge. So yeah, you can quickly be two, three seconds a lap slower.”Also Read: Tokyo E-Prix 2025: Schedule, timing and where to watch Round 8 and Round 9 Formula E races Nyck De Vries told the portal about racing in wet conditions, ""If it's wet, you're not even reaching full throttle.

Obviously, street tracks are always challenging in the wet, and grip levels are low.""","The weather forecast shows a 100 percent chance of rainfall on both Saturday and Sunday.

NEW DELHI: As the clay court season reaches its big stage with Roland Garros , it once again reinforces the point in Indian tennis that the focus is on doubles and not singles. Leading the charge on that front is Yuki Bhambri , who was once the flag bearer in the singles department.The year, though, didn’t begin as Bhambri might have hoped. At the Australian Open, partnering Albano Olivetti, the duo bowed out in the first round.What has followed is a string of partner changes, not by design but by necessity, as Olivetti's injury and the volatile nature of the rankings forced Bhambri to adapt.His journey resumed with Croatian veteran Ivan Dodig at the ATP 250 in Montpellier. Since then, the Indian ace has had to recalibrate often. 2025 has so far witnessed Bhambri partnering with seven different players in 13 tournaments.Despite the instability, the results speak volumes. Bhambri (and Alexei Popyrin) clinched the ATP 500 title in Dubai, made it to the quarters at Indian Wells and Miami, and became India’s No. 1 in doubles last March, overtaking Rohan Bopanna , who had held that position since October 2019.Speaking to TimesofIndia.com before the Madrid Open, Bhambri acknowledged the highs and lows, ""I think it's part and parcel of our tennis, of rankings going up and down. I think tennis rewards you for consistency, and I've had good success over the last few months or so, which has just shown in the rankings.""But now comes another test, the clay. On the red dirt, Bhambri hasn't had the best results in the run-up to the French Open. Four of his last five clay appearances ended in first-round exits, with Robert Galloway being his regular companion in the latest tournaments.The 32-year-old, however, remains undeterred.""When you move on to clay, it's a lot slower. So you have to have a lot more patience. You have to be prepared to hit a lot of balls. You have to be prepared to slide on the court, find your footing, you know, be prepared for the bad bounces at times. So you're playing a very slow and patient game,"" he added.The only exception to Bhambri's clay troubles came in Bordeaux, partnering Galloway again. The pair fought in the ATP Challenger final but fell just short, losing 6-7(1), 6-7(2) to the fourth-seeded pairing of Francisco Cabral and Lucas Miedler.His dethroning of Bopanna ended a 286-week reign, coupled with a steady upward trend in his doubles rankings since the COVID-19 pandemic, signals nothing but sheer improvement.While Bhambri's stay at the top did not last long enough as the old warhorse Boppana has again occupied the India No.1 spot in the latest ATP doubles rankings, the New Delhi-born, who spends his days back in India mentoring kids at Roundglass Tennis Academy alongside his childhood coach Aditya Sachdeva, has grown more stubborn than ever.""I think the ultimate goal is to try and do better from here, to try and compete for more trophies. The French (Open) coming up, Wimbledon coming up soon in July, those would be the two key goals where I would really like to hopefully put my best foot forward and succeed,"" he noted.With Roland Garros just around the corner, the elements of something remarkable are there, but the big question remains: Can Bhambri, amid all the changes and challenges, find the right formula on clay? Indian tennis won’t have to wait long for an answer.",Yuki Bhambri is India's No.1 doubles player. The 32-year-old has had a string of partner changes this year. The Indian ace has had to recalibrate often on the red dirt. He has had four of his last five clay appearances end in first-round exits.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121292757,imgsize-37056,width-400,resizemode-4/121292757.jpg"

Carlos Alcaraz won the Italian Open on Sunday after beating rival Jannik Sinner 7-6 (7/5), 6-1 in the final and firing a warning shot for Roland Garros .Alcaraz, who will climb to world number two behind Sinner on Monday, won his third title of the season ahead of the French Open which starts next weekend. The Spaniard claimed victory in his fourth final of the season and sent a message to the rest of the men's tour for Roland Garros where he will defend the title.Sinner tops the world rankings but his 26-match winning streak was ended by Alcaraz, also the man who had last beat him in last year's China Open final.Alcaraz is the only man to beat Sinner in a tour final since the start of 2024, when his Italian rival began his rise to the top of men's tennis and three Grand Slam titles.The 22-year-old has had a hugely impressive clay court swing this season even with the thigh injury which cost him the chance to compete at the Madrid Open.Alcaraz won in Rome a second Masters 1000 title of the year to go alongside his victory at Monte Carlo last month. He also reached the final in Barcelona.Finishing runner-up is still a hugely positive result for Sinner in his first tournament since his three-month ban for testing positive twice in March last year for traces of clostebol, a contamination doping authorities accepted was accidental.His progress in Rome also sets up the possibility of another final clash with Alcaraz at Roland Garros, with the two young stars of men's tennis set to be the two top seeds in Paris.Sinner was gunning to become the first Italian man to win at the Foro Italico since Adriano Panatta back in 1976, but he failed to make it a hat-trick of triumphs for home players in the Italian capital.Earlier Jasmine Paolini became the first woman since Monica Seles in 1990 to win the Rome singles and doubles titles when she and Sara Errani beat Veronika Kudermetova and Elise Mertens 6-4, 7-5.Paolini secured that brace of victories a day after overcoming former US Open champion Coco Gauff in straight sets, and becoming the first Italian woman to win the Rome singles title since Raffaella Reggi in 1985.","Carlos Alcaraz beat Jannik Sinner 7-6 (7/5), 6-1 in the Italian Open final.

NEW DELHI: In a remarkable victory at the Italian Open on Saturday, Jasmine Paolini secured her second 1000 series championship by defeating Coco Gauff 6-4, 6-2, setting a positive tone before Roland Garros this month.The achievement marks Paolini as the first Italian woman to secure the Rome tournament since Raffaella Reggi's victory in 1985, demonstrating her superiority over former US Open champion Gauff.The packed centre court at the Foro Italico witnessed Paolini's triumph, potentially the first of three titles that could be secured by Italian players in this year's Rome tournament.At 29, Paolini has become the oldest first-time Rome champion in the Open Era. Meanwhile, Gauff, who is eight years younger, missed the opportunity to become the youngest victor since Serena Williams' achievement in 2002.Gauff's performance was hindered by 55 unforced errors and seven double faults on serve, similar to her semi-final match against Zheng Qinwen, which simplified Paolini's path to victory.Paolini could achieve additional success in the women's doubles tournament, where she and Sara Errani face Veronika Kudermetova and Elise Mertens in Sunday's final.The last woman to win both singles and doubles titles in Rome was Monica Seles in 1990, whilst Vera Zvonareva remains the sole player to accomplish this feat in a 1000 series tournament at Indian Wells in 2009.The tournament continues with Paolini's fellow Italian Jannik Sinner set to compete against Carlos Alcaraz in Sunday's men's singles final.","Jasmine Paolini defeated Coco Gauff 6-4, 6-2 in the Italian Open final.

Sinner bounces back

Jannik Sinner set up a blockbuster Italian Open final with Carlos Alcaraz by beating Tommy Paul 1-6, 6-0, 6-3 on Friday.World number one Sinner fought back from a set down in front of a packed crowd to continue his march towards a first title at the Foro Italico .After a strangely slow start, Sinner again showed good form on centre court where, since returning to action last week from a three-month doping ban, he has taken his unbeaten run to 26 matches.And the 23-year-old will face down Alcaraz, the last man to beat Sinner in the final at the China Open in early October, with all eyes on another potential final between the pair at the French Open next month.A win for Sinner against his rival would see the men's Rome title go to an Italian for the first time since Adriano Panatta in 1976.""If I want to win Sunday I have to play one of my best tennis for sure,"" said Sinner.""Carlos has played incredible tennis today, so let's see what's coming but from my side you know incredible to be here in the final.""Alcaraz booked his place in the showdown by beating Sinner's countryman Lorenzo Musetti 6-3, 7-6 (7/4).The four-time Grand Slam champion overcame Musetti and the windy conditions in just over two hours to reach his fourth final of the season.""I'm going to have dinner, but my phone is going to be there watching (Sinner's) match,"" said Alcaraz after his win.""I have to know against who I'm going to play. I have to watch the match and see how they are going to play.""Musetti was beaten by Alcaraz in the Monte Carlo final last month and fell to his fifth straight defeat to the Spaniard after a frustrating display.And he believes that Alcaraz will have the better of it against Sinner if he brings his top form on Sunday evening.""I really rate Carlos. I think on clay that the best version of Carlos is favourite against anyone... that includes Jannik,"" he told reporters.Paul rattled off the first five games in 21 minutes in a near replica of what Sinner did to Casper Ruud on Thursday, closing out the first set in less than half an hour.The last time Sinner lost a set 6-1 was in the quarter-finals of the US Open against Daniil Medvedev, a match he won on his way to his second Grand Slam triumph.Sinner looked a shadow of the player who dominated tennis throughout 2024 right up to the start of his suspension, which was agreed with the World Anti-Doping Agency in early February.But from nowhere he came roaring back in the second set, finally forcing Paul back with some deep baseline shots of his own and his first aces of the match to win the second set to love and level the match.It was a complete role reversal with Paul now the one being thrown around the court, the world number 12 winning just 12 points in the second set and looking bewildered at how quickly the momentum shifted.Paul then handed Sinner the initiative with his second double fault of the night in game two of the third set. The Italian eventually won nine games in a row and marched on to victory.Earlier, Jasmine Paolini continued her bid to win the women's singles and doubles titles in Rome after reaching her second final of the week, this time alongside fellow Italian Sara Errani .Paolini and Errani, the reigning doubles champions, will meet Veronika Kudermetova and Elise Mertens in the final on Sunday, before which Paolini could already be crowed singles champion.Late bloomer Paolini takes on Coco Gauff on Saturday aiming for her second 1000 series title at the age of 29 and to become the first Italian women to win in Rome since Raffaella Reggi in 1985.","Jannik Sinner will play Carlos Alcaraz in the Italian Open final.

Gauff joins Paolini

Jannik Sinner marched into the semi-finals of the Italian Open on Thursday after destroying Casper Ruud in straight sets 6-0, 6-1 as Coco Gauff won a marathon three-set battle with China's Zheng Qinwen to advance to the women's final.American Gauff will face Italy's Jasmine Paolini in Saturday's title match after pulling through 7-6 (7/3), 4-6, 7-6 (7/4) in a match that lasted over three-and-a-half hours.Ruud was supposed to be Sinner's toughest test in Rome since he came back from his three-month doping ban, as the Norwegian came into the match in hot form on clay after winning in Madrid earlier this month.In his previous matches Sinner looked to be still finding his feet after his suspension, accepted from the World Anti-Doping Agency for testing positive for traces of clostebol in March last year.But the 23-year-old demolished sixth seed Ruud in just over an hour with an ominous display of tennis, his domination such that the home fans at the packed centre court, seemingly out of sympathy, began to cheer the rare points that Ruud won.""I was feeling great on court today. I think we all saw that,"" said Sinner.""How I felt today was very, very positive signs for me... I was serving well and also returning well. Moving great on the court, so I'm very happy about that.""Ruud even got the loudest celebration of the match when he held his serve for the only time, in game three of the second set, holding his arms aloft in ironic joy.""He was just everywhere... it's just like playing a wall that you know shoots hundred miles an hour balls at you all the time,"" said a bewildered Ruud.Tommy Paul, a 7-6 (7/4), 6-3 winner over Hubert Hurkacz in the day's first match, will have wondered what on earth he can do to stop Sinner if the Italian brings that form to Friday's last-four clash.Sinner won the first set in just 27 minutes, giving up only seven points as he stalked the court with intent, dressed all in black as he has been all week.And he then maintained his record of not dropping a set in the tournament to not so much stroll as smash into the last four, and send a message to Carlos Alcaraz.Spaniard Alcaraz, Sinner's key Grand Slam rival ahead of the French Open, will contest the other semi-final with Lorenzo Musetti on Friday afternoon, with the blockbuster final tennis fans wanted still on.Gauff prevailed on a centre court left mostly empty by fans who headed for the exits in large numbers after watching Sinner's tennis clinic.Former US Open winner Gauff won her third straight match against Olympic gold medallist Zheng, after coming through a tie in which she made 15 double faults on serve and there were a combined total of 156 unforced errors.The 21-year-old is looking for her first title of the season after losing the Madrid final to Sabalenka, and against home hope Paolini will find herself in a much fiercer atmosphere than the soporific crowd which stayed till past midnight to watch her reach her second final of the year.""I told myself I'm ready to go home,"" said an exhausted Gauff.""It was tough for me, finding my rhythm especially at night, it was so slow, I just tried to stay in there.""I was frustrated. She forced me to get out of my comfort zone.""Sixth seed Paolini is the third Italian woman to reach the Foro Italico final, and the first since her doubles partner Sara Errani was thumped by Serena Williams in 2014.Late bloomer Paolini, 29, will have a chance to be the first woman from the Mediterranean nation to win in Rome since Raffaella Reggi in 1985, after beating Peyton Stearns 7-5, 6-1.""It's a privilege to be in this position. I matured late as a tennis player but everyone has their own path. Some mature earlier and some later,"" said Paolini.""I'm just enjoying it without thinking too much about the past.""Paolini could yet win both the singles and women's doubles tournaments, with her and Errani taking on Mirra Andreeva and Diana Shnaider in the semi-finals on Friday.","Jannik Sinner thrashes Casper Ruud in straight sets 6-0, 6-1. Coco Gauff beats China's Zheng Qinwen to reach women's final. Gauff will face Italy's Jasmine Paolini in Saturday's title match. Tommy Paul beats Hubert Hurkacz in day's first match.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121200918,imgsize-24478,width-400,resizemode-4/Jannik-Sinner-Rome-AP.jpg"

Poll What do you think about Jannik Sinner's chances at the Italian Open? He will be eliminated early He will reach the finals He will win the title

Top-ranked tennis player Jannik Sinner met with Pope Leo XIV at the Vatican City on Wednesday during a break from the Italian Open , presenting the pontiff with a tennis racket and offering to play. The meeting came after the pope, known for his liking towards the sport, had earlier joked about not inviting Sinner, making a wordplay on the athlete's surname.The encounter took place in the Vatican's auditorium reception room, where Sinner arrived with his parents.""It's an honor,"" Sinner said in Italian as he presented the pope with a racket and ball, suggesting a quick volley.The 69-year-old American pope, who hails from Chicago, declined the offer to play, looking at the surrounding antiques and saying, ""Better not.""Leo XIV made a light-hearted comment about his white cassock being appropriate for Wimbledon, referencing the tournament's all-white dress code. The meeting included discussions about Sinner's progress in the Italian Open, where he faces a quarterfinal match on Thursday against Madrid champion Casper Ruud.Sinner is returning to competition after a three-month doping ban, which was determined to be due to accidental contamination.The Italian player is aiming to become the first from his country to claim the Rome title since Adriano Panatta's victory in 1976.During the interaction, Italian Tennis and Padel Federation head Angelo Binaghi presented the pope with an honorary federation card. ""We all felt the passion that Leo XIV has for our sport and this filled us with pride,"" Binaghi stated. ""We hope to embrace the Holy Father again soon, maybe on a tennis court.""The meeting included a photo session featuring the Davis Cup trophy, which Sinner helped Italy secure for the second consecutive year. The Billie Jean King Cup trophy, won by Italy in 2024, was also displayed during the meeting.Earlier in the week, Sinner had responded positively to the pope's initial joke, noting it was ""a good thing for us tennis players"" to have a pope who enjoys the sport.Beyond tennis, Pope Leo XIV is known to be a devoted Chicago White Sox baseball fan, following in the tradition of his predecessor, Pope Francis, who supported the Buenos Aires football club San Lorenzo.","Top-ranked tennis player Jannik Sinner met with Pope Leo XIV at the Vatican City on Wednesday during a break from the Italian Open.

Carlos Alcaraz made a triumphant return following his injury recovery, defeating Serbian qualifier Dusan Lajovic 6-3, 6-3 at the Italian Open on Friday.The world number three had previously pulled out of the Madrid Open, citing an upper right leg issue that impacted his performance in the Barcelona Open final, along with a left leg concern.Alcaraz competed against Lajovic whilst wearing a black support that covered his upper right leg, extending just below his knee.""The body felt great,"" Alcaraz said. ""I just moved well. I made a few good sprints today without any pain. ... It was a test for me so I think I passed the test today.""""It was a great performance, great level, which was surprising for me a little bit, but just really happy for that,"" Alcaraz added.After winning the initial four games, Alcaraz lost his serve while attempting to finish the first set at 5-2. He regained control by breaking back, showcasing his court abilities at the Foro Italico with an impressive backhand winner following a drop shot.The second set progressed similarly, with Alcaraz establishing an early advantage. He registered 24 winners and 24 unforced errors during the match.Following his Monte Carlo Masters victory in April, Alcaraz's clay court statistics this season improved to 10-1.

Bombay Sport Exchange Ep 4: Prof. Ratnakar Shetty on BCCI, cricket politics & Indian cricket's growth

Jannik Sinner will delight crowds at the Rome Open this week when the world number one makes his return to tennis, but the Italian's three-month doping ban has allowed other local rising stars to move into the limelight.Sinner was on Monday joined in the top 10 of the men's world rankings by Lorenzo Musetti , who is at number nine after reaching the Monte Carlo final and the last four in Madrid.Meanwhile Luciano Darderi and Flavio Cobolli won tournaments in Marrakesh and Bucharest in April, further underlining the strength in depth that Italian tennis has behind Sinner, a three-time Grand Slam winner.Filippo Volandri , captain of the Italy team which has won the last two editions of the Davis Cup, told AFP that ""Italian tennis is clearly in a golden age"".""But it's been a long time coming, we're seeing the fruits of work which was started some time ago,"" he added.Volandri, who has been in charge of top-level male players for the Italian Tennis Federation (FITP) for the last nine years, showed AFP a graphic which illustrates Italy's recent progress.Between 2005 and 2015 Italian players won eight ATP titles -- with seven of those in the lowest 250 category -- but since 2016 the tally of tournament wins has more than trebled to 31.Five of those 31 wins have come in top-level Master 1000 tournaments, with another three being Sinner's Grand Slam triumphs. Sinner is responsible in total for 19 of Italy's ATP wins since 2016.""Jannik is the product of a movement which had already given us Matteo Berrettini reaching the Wimbledon final (in 2021). He is the result of a system that works,"" said Volandri.Michelangelo Dell'Edera, the director of the FITP's Higher Training Institute, told AFP that the federation runs a geographically-decentralised system which was put in place at the end of the 1990s.""Every province has a coach from the federation for children between 8-10 years old, while each region has a manager in charge of players between the ages of 11 and 16,"" explained Dell'Edera.Players were for a long time obliged to move to the national training centre at Tirrenia, just up the Tuscany coast from Livorno, but that is no longer the case.""Decentralisation means making our skills available to young players and their coaches,"" said Volandri.""We're reaching out to them rather than tearing them away from their families and their lives.""Dell'Edera said the renaissance in Italian tennis has also come via a change in training philosophy and playing style.""To make a comparison with another sport, we've gone from the marathon, where players were slugging forehands and backhands, to the 100m, a sort of 'speed tennis' where the emphasis is on the serve and return, two shots which determine whether a point can be won,"" he said.Every year for the past seven years, just before the Rome Open the FITP invites its 12,000 coaches to a seminar at the picturesque Foro Italico where the major clay court tournament is played.The seminar is held to discuss training, physical preparation and tactics, with guest appearances from big foreign names in the field such as Emilio Sanchez and Brad Gilbert, who were there on Saturday.Gilbert, the former coach of tennis icon Andre Agassi, is impressed with the work being done in Italy.""They're getting to the top, they have Sinner. Sometimes you get to the top and you rest. If anything, they are spending more,"" said Gilbert.""They've made an incredible commitment and they've got a great supporting team. Sinner is the reward.""But they started this thing 10, 15 years ago and they're still producing. I just watched this kid... Federico Cina. He is special.""Cina could have the chance to show how special he is as he will play Sinner in the second round in Rome if he gets past Argentinian Mariano Navone in his opening match.","Italian tennis is in a golden age, according to captain Filippo Volandri. Jannik Sinner will return to action at the Rome Open this week after a three-month doping ban. Lorenzo Musetti and Luciano Darderi are also in the top 10 of the world rankings.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120924340,imgsize-23878,width-400,resizemode-4/Jannik-Sinner-Rome-AP.jpg"

Bombay Sport Exchange Ep 5: Shane Watson on how IPL gave him a lifeline & his tribute to Phil Hughes

CHENNAI: Young shuttler Sathish Kumar Karunakaran notched up the biggest win of his career yet as he defeated world No. 7 Chou Tien Chen of Chinese Taipei 21-13, 21-14 in the Malaysia Masters men’s singles opening round in Bukit Jalil on Wednesday.His dominance throughout the contest was a highlight; he pressed on the accelerator from the get-go to set the tone early. The 24-year-old Sathish has added variety to his game over the past year, and his efforts have paid off. The Tamil Nadu shuttler used jump smashes and his receptive skills to perfection, putting Chou in trouble.While Sathish has been inconsistent this season so far, this victory should do a world of good and restore his confidence. “I was searching for the breakthrough for quite some time and I am happy to have recorded my biggest win. What went in my favour was that I controlled the game better. For example, going to the net quickly, and that gave me an advantage,” Sathish told TOI from Malaysia.Sathish moved from training with Ajit Wijetilekk to working with his junior coach, Jivananthan Nair from Malaysia. “It has been a year under Jiva sir and everything is working well.My choices of shots have become much better than what they were earlier and that is making a big difference,” Sathish added.For Jivananthan, the latest result in singles was not a surprise, but he did not expect his ward to register a convincing victory. “We have been working on quite a few technical aspects, refining some parts of the game. Sathish was always a very straightforward player. He had to add variation to his game to compete against the top-10 players. And that is exactly what I did.“When you add variations, what happens is that consistency tends to drop for a while. It is a process. We knew that the process would take time and we were prepared for it. It was good that he was able to put those variations into good use as his opponent was not ready for it,” Jivananthan said.Sathish took a break from competitive action after the Sudirman Cup and shifted his focus to training. Considering the packed schedule, he had to pick and choose tournaments. “I skipped the Chinese Taipei Open and I will not be playing the Singapore Open next week as well. I did not have the option to take a break earlier and wanted to represent my country in the Badminton Asia Championships and Sudirman Cup.”Like in singles, Sathish has had an inconsistent run in mixed doubles. On Wednesday, after his singles win, the Sathish-Aadya Variyath duo lost 15-21, 16-21 to Indonesia’s Yustin Mulia and Ayu Kusumawati in the round-of-32. Although Sathish is going through a rough patch in mixed doubles, he believes that playing doubles is helping his singles game.","Sathish Kumar Karunakaran defeated world No. 7 Chou Tien Chen of Chinese Taipei 21-13, 21-14 in the Malaysia Masters men’s singles opening round in Bukit Jalil on Wednesday.

NEW DELHI: In a significant development at the USD 240,000 BWF Taipei Open Super 300 on Saturday, promising Indian shuttlers Ayush Shetty and Unnati Hooda concluded their remarkable journey with semifinal appearances in their respective singles categories.Twenty-year-old Ayush, who claimed bronze at the 2023 World Junior Championships , displayed resilience but ultimately succumbed 18-21, 17-21 to home favourite and world No.7 Chou Tien Chen , an experienced competitor with nearly 20 years in international badminton.Meanwhile, Unnati, victor at the 2022 Odisha Masters and 2023 Abu Dhabi Masters, showed initial promise before falling 19-21, 11-21 to Japanese top seed and world No. 8 Tomoka Miyazaki , the 2022 World Junior Champion, in a 43-minute contest.Ayush, known for his powerful smashes and effective net control, had previously defeated notable players including All England finalist Lee Chia Hao, former world No. 1 Kidambi Srikanth, and Canada's Brian Yang.In his match against Chou, Ayush established an early 8-4 advantage through precise forecourt play and angular shots. However, several mistakes allowed Chou to reduce the deficit to 10-9 before securing a slight lead at the interval.The score remained tight at 11-11, with both players exchanging points. Despite Ayush's aggressive forehand smashes, Chou's experience proved decisive.At 18-18, the local player executed a body smash followed by an accurate backhand to secure the first game.The second game maintained similar intensity. Ayush's varied shot selection helped him lead 11-10 at the break.Chou regained control, winning crucial net exchanges to establish a 13-11 lead.

Miyazaki reduced the gap to 10-12 and achieved parity at 18-all when Hooda made a net error.The Japanese player secured the game point as Hooda hit wide, concluding with an accurate straight smash.Miyazaki dominated the second game, leading 4-0 as Hooda appeared unsettled.

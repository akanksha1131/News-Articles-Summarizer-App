HOW HOCKEY HELPED TRISTIAN STUBBS

NEW DELHI: If Tristan Stubbs wasn’t sending bowlers into the stands with his brute power, the 24-year-old might have been executing push passes, flicks, or drag flicks on the hockey turf. Had he not chosen cricket, Stubbs would likely have pursued a career in hockey - following in his father’s footsteps.Tristan’s father Chris Stubbs was a well-known name in South Africa’s hockey circuit. A former provincial player, Chris never got the chance to represent the national team. Despite that, he never discouraged his son from choosing cricket over hockey.In fact, Tristan began his sporting journey with hockey, but the allure of fame and financial stability eventually became key reasons for Chris to guide him towards the gentleman’s game. Having experienced the struggles and limitations of a hockey career firsthand, Chris didn’t want his son to face the same hurdles.Tristan grew up watching his father dominate with a hockey stick, and naturally picked up the sport. But over time, Chris gradually nudged him towards cricket — a move that would shape his future.""There's no money in hockey. Hockey is hard work and it's fun, but it's not a career,"" said Chris, who was watching his son practice from the stands ahead of the Delhi Capitals vs Rajasthan Royals clash at the Arun Jaitley Stadium, in an exclusive interview with TimesofIndia.com. Tristian plays for Delhi Capitals in the IPL 2025 .Chris still regrets not making it to the senior national team, but one milestone he proudly checked off was playing against India.""I played provincial hockey, but I wasn't good enough to play for South Africa. One of my biggest games was against India. They came to South Africa in the '90s, when they first came back — when we came out of isolation in '92. I played for Southern Transvaal and played against India. Southern Transvaal were quite a good team in South Africa. It was a warm-up game. And then, when they came on their tour to play against South Africa, they played a warm-up game. They played a game against Southern Transvaal.""India crushed us 5-0,"" Chris said with a big laugh.The dream of representing his country remained unfulfilled for Chris, but he hoped his son Tristan would go further — wearing the national jersey with the country’s flag proudly on his chest.Chris wanted his son to begin his journey with hockey — to build strength, timing, and ball control — and then channel that same brute power and hand-eye coordination into cricket.And that’s exactly what Tristan is doing now. He’s become a nightmare for bowlers across the globe.Stubbs walks in, picks the length in a flash, and sends the ball soaring into the stands. Pulls, sweeps, reverse sweeps, scoops, paddle sweeps, straight drives — you name it, they’re all in his arsenal.""Obviously, he always wanted to play cricket. Hockey was never really a thing. He played hockey because he loved it, but he loved cricket as well. So he wanted to, you know, basically go to university to try and play cricket — to try and play provincial cricket — and that was his main aim: to play cricket. Hockey was just to keep fit and have fun. He enjoyed hockey, and he was good at it, but he really wanted to play cricket from an early age,"" Chris said.""Playing both hockey and cricket helped him a lot. Some of his sweep shots clearly came from his reverse sticks. His reverse shots come from hockey. He was always on the side of the field when we played, and he grew up with a hockey stick in one hand and a ball in the other — he always had a ball in his hand,"" Chris added.","Tristan Stubbs grew up watching his father dominate with a hockey stick, and naturally picked up the sport.

Vithya bags top spot:

CHENNAI: With the Federation Cup just a few days away, several high-profile athletes chose not to push themselves at the Indian Open here on Tuesday. Some events at the Indian Open witnessed upsets, while others were marred by injuries. Jeswin Aldrin , competing for the first time since the Paris Olympics, managed only one valid attempt and finished seventh with a best effort of 7.36m in men’s long jump. The 24-year-old struggled to adapt to the hot conditions and pulled his hamstring during the warm-up, just minutes before the competition.The national-record holder was unable to adjust to the heat quickly enough. Up-and-coming athlete Aditya Singh clinched the top spot with a best jump of 7.74m. He was the only Indian athlete to cross the 8m mark last year and has started this season on a bright note.“I was not happy with the way I ran in the runway. Had my approach been better, I could have jumped close to my best, even crossed the Asian Championships mark (8.07m),” Aditya said. The 23-year-old Aditya, who started his career as a long jumper in 2016, returned to the event in 2022 after a brief sojourn with sprinting.Shot putter Tajinderpal Singh Toor secured the top spot, recording 17.61m. The Olympian registered only one legal throw, commit- ting two fouls and opting not to attempt his final three chances. Tajinderpal was competing due to the AFI’s guideline of participation in at least one domestic meet be- fore the Federation Cup.Vithya Ramraj earned gold in women’s 400m hurdles with a sub-par timing of 56.90s, while R Anu (57.52s) gave a tough fight and bagged a silver",Long jumper Jeswin Aldrin pulled his hamstring during warm-up.

NEW DELHI: Chennai Super Kings snapped their five-match losing streak in the Indian Premier League 2025 with a much-needed five-wicket win over Lucknow Super Giants at the Ekana Stadium on Monday. Despite the morale-boosting result, CSK remain at the bottom of the points table with just four points from seven matches.Opting to bowl first, CSK restricted LSG to 166 for 7, thanks to disciplined efforts from their bowlers. Rishabh Pant led the way for Lucknow with a fighting 63 off 49 balls, including four fours and four sixes, while Mitchell Marsh contributed 30 off 25 balls at the top.Ravindra Jadeja starred with the ball, picking up 2 for 24 in three overs, while seamers Khaleel Ahmed and Anshul Kamboj chipped in with early breakthroughs.In reply, CSK were wobbling at 111 for 5 after a solid start from Rachin Ravindra (37 off 22). But Shivam Dube held his nerve with a patient 43* off 37 balls. He found a perfect ally in MS Dhoni, who turned back the clock with a blistering 26* off 11 deliveries, sealing the win with three balls to spare. The two added a match-winning 57-run partnership in 4.3 overs.Youngster Shaik Rasheed also made an impression on debut with a handy 27 off 19 balls, providing CSK some middle-order stability.This win, while important for CSK’s confidence, does little to change their position at the foot of the table.

NEW DELHI: Delhi Capitals are set to host Mumbai Indians in their IPL 2025 clash at the Arun Jaitley Stadium on Sunday. The Hardik Pandya-led Mumbai Indians have already arrived in the capital and are currently training in the city.However, their preparations were affected as Delhi and surrounding NCR regions experienced a sudden dip in temperature on Friday, accompanied by dusty storms for the second consecutive day. The weather disrupted flight operations at the Delhi airport, leading to multiple delays and diversions — and even impacted Mumbai Indians’ practice session.In a video shared by the Mumbai Indians on their social media platforms, star batter Rohit Sharma is seen reacting humorously to the incoming storm. As strong winds hit the stadium, Rohit can be heard shouting “comeback” to his teammates. He then playfully tells the cameraman to focus on the storm instead of him.(Hey, why are you filming me? Shoot the storm instead),"" Rohit says in the clip.Meanwhile, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) has issued a yellow alert for Delhi on April 11, with temperatures expected to range between 23°C and 38°C.While the storms caused disruption, the overcast skies and cooler winds brought a brief respite from the heatwave that had gripped the region over the past week.Delhi Capitals remain the only unbeaten side in the tournament so far with four wins from four matches.Mumbai Indians, on the other hand, are struggling at the bottom half of the table — placed eighth with just one win and four defeats in five games.","Delhi Capitals host Mumbai Indians in their IPL 2025 clash on Sunday.

IPL record

Marco Jansen and Shreyas Iyer

IPL Points Table

Proving once again that lowscoring T20 games can be gripping, the Punjab Kings (PBKS) bounced back gallantly after being shot out for a paltry 111 in 15.3 overs at the Mullanpur Stadium on Tuesday. Punjab then dismissed Kolkata Knight Riders for a mere 95 in return, in 15.1 overs.The result was a sensational 16-run win that sets a new record for the lowest total defended in IPL history . The heroes of PBKS’ stunning win were legspinner Yuzvendra Chahal (4/28 in 4 overs) and South African leftarm pacer Marco Jansen (3/17 in 3.1 overs). Though no longer in Team India’s setup, Chahal served a stern reminder to the national selectors, showcasing his immense skill and temperament yet again.The 34-yearold removed KKR skipper Ajinkya Rahane, top-scorer Angkrish Raghuvanshi, Rinku Singh and Ramandeep Singh in a magical spell that completely turned the game. From a strong 72/3 in the 10th over, KKR collapsed catastrophically, losing seven wickets for just 23 runs in 36 balls. The defending champions were rattled. A desperate Andre Russell momentarily sparked hope, smashing Chahal for two sixes and a four in the 14th over. But the West Indian’s nightmare continued when he inside-edged a pull off Jansen onto his stumps to seal KKR’s fate.Ironically, in their previous match, Punjab had posted a mammoth 245/6 only to lose to Sunrisers Hyderabad in Hyderabad. Earlier, KKR’s bowlers, led by India pacer Harshit Rana (3/25 in 3 overs), had shot out PBKS for a paltry 111. The Punjab top-order collapsed after a brisk 39-run start in 20 balls by Priyansh Arya (22 off 12) and Prabhsimran Singh (30 off 15). They crumbled to 86/8 in 11 overs before Shashank Singh and Bartlett added a crucial 23 off 25 balls for the ninth wicket.All three top PBKS wickets claimed by Rana were caught by Ramandeep Singh, playing on his home turf, a unique feat in itself. Skipper Shreyas Iyer , facing his former team — which he led to the title last year — fell for a two-ball duck. His previous outing had seen him score a sparkling 82 off 36. KKR’s spinners then took over. Varun Chakravarthy (2/21) and Sunil Narine (2/14) applied pressure.Narine also broke an IPL record by taking his 36th wicket against PBKS, the most by any bowler against a single franchise in the tournament. PBKS’s Aussie recruits, Josh Inglis (2) and Glenn Maxwell (7), again failed with the bat. Maxwell’s horror run continues — 41 runs in six matches @ 8.20 — though he did take the wicket of Venkatesh Iyer (7). Shashank Singh was dismissed LBW for 18, while Suryansh Shedge, brought in as an ‘Impact Sub’, edged behind while trying to cut Narine, missing a golden chance to impress.",Punjab Kings beat Kolkata Knight Riders by 16 runs. KKR were shot out for a paltry 111 in 15.3 overs. Punjab then dismissed KKR for a mere 95 in return. The result sets a new record for the lowest total defended in IPL history.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120329164,imgsize-159786,width-400,resizemode-4/R-Singh-is-stumped-out-by-Josh-Inglis.jpg"

After a dream start to their IPL 2025 campaign, Delhi Capitals were jolted by a dramatic home defeat against Mumbai Indians. Riding a four-match winning streak, the Axar Patel-led side looked unstoppable until a shocking collapse derailed their 206-run chase on Sunday. Despite Karun Nair ’s scintillating 89, DC crumbled from 119/1 to 193 all out, slipping to second on the points table.They now face a faltering Rajasthan Royals side, who sit eighth with just two wins in six games. The Royals have battled inconsistency all season, with their batting unit misfiring despite flashes of brilliance from Yashasvi Jaiswal and Riyan Parag.Delhi’s spin duo — Kuldeep Yadav and youngster Vipraj Nigam — will again be central to their plans, having regularly outfoxed opposition batters. However, Axar Patel ’s personal form remains a concern. The all-rounder is yet to pick a wicket in six games and has had little impact with the bat.With Faf du Plessis still injured, Nair's return strengthens a middle order that includes KL Rahul, Tristan Stubbs, and Ashutosh Sharma. In contrast, the Royals’ bowling lacked bite, with Jofra Archer only just finding rhythm and most others struggling for control.In a clash of redemption, Delhi will aim to reset their title charge, while Rajasthan desperately seek stability.The square boundaries measure 60m and 66m, with a 72m hit straight down the ground. This is a high-scoring venue, with 235 being the highest total recorded here. The pitch has straw-colored grass and visible cracks — it's not as flat as usual, but that’s unlikely to impact run-scoring much. Historically, teams batting first have had more success here, so winning the toss should mean opting to bat and setting a big total.Jake Fraser-McGurk, Abishek Porel, KL Rahul (w), Tristan Stubbs, Axar Patel (c), Ashutosh Sharma, Vipraj Nigam, Mitchell Starc, Mohit Sharma, Kuldeep Yadav, Mukesh KumarKarun NairYashasvi Jaiswal, Sanju Samson (w/c), Nitish Rana, Riyan Parag, Dhruv Jurel, Shimron Hetmyer, Wanindu Hasaranga, Jofra Archer, Maheesh Theekshana, Sandeep Sharma, Tushar DeshpandeShubham DubeyAxar Patel (C), Faf du Plessis, Karun Nair, Sameer Rizvi, Jake Fraser-McGurk, Ashutosh Sharma, KL Rahul, Abishek Porel, Donovan Ferreira, Tristan Stubbs, Madhav Tiwari, Tripurana Vijay, Manvanth Kumar, Vipraj Nigam, Ajay Mandal, Darshan Nalkande, Mukesh Kumar, Mohit Sharma, T Natarajan, Mitchell Starc, Dushmantha Chameera, Kuldeep Yadav.Sanju Samson (c), Yashasvi Jaiswal, Shubham Dubey, Nitish Rana, Riyan Parag, Dhruv Jurel (w), Shimron Hetmyer, Jofra Archer, Maheesh Theekshana, Tushar Deshpande, Sandeep Sharma, Fazalhaq Farooqi, Kunal Singh Rathore, Akash Madhwal, Kumar Kartikeya, Kwena Maphaka, Wanindu Hasaranga, Yudhvir Singh Charak, Ashok Sharma, Vaibhav Suryavanshi.Former champions Rajasthan Royals hold a slight edge over Delhi Capitals, having won 15 of their 29 encounters.

Lowest all-out totals for PBKS

NEW DELHI: Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) stalwart Sunil Narine etched his name into the Indian Premier League (IPL) record books on Tuesday by becoming the bowler with the most wickets against a single franchise in the tournament’s history.The veteran spinner achieved the feat during KKR’s dominant clash against Punjab Kings (PBKS) at Mullanpur, Chandigarh. Narine dismissed Suryansh Shedge and Marco Jansen in the same over to take his tally against PBKS to 36 wickets, surpassing Umesh Yadav 's previous record of 35 wickets—also against Punjab.Narine's final figures of 2 for 14 in three overs played a key role in dismantling PBKS for just 111 in 15.3 overs — the third lowest team total in IPL 2025 so far.The new record puts Narine at the top of an elite list that includes Umesh Yadav (35 vs PBKS), Dwayne Bravo (33 vs MI), and Mohit Sharma (33 vs MI).36 - Sunil Narine vs PBKS35 - Umesh Yadav vs PBKS33 - Dwayne Bravo vs MI33 - Mohit Sharma vs MI32 - Yuzvendra Chahal vs PBKS32 - Bhuvneshwar Kumar vs KKRKKR’s bowling attack was clinical, with Harshit Rana (3/25) leading the charge, while Varun Chakaravarthy (2/21) and Narine supported ably.

MCA to honour ex-prez Amol Kale too

Does MS Dhoni have any luck left? Greenstone Lobo on CSK's 2025 chances!

MUMBAI: In a significant development, the Mumbai Cricket Association (MCA), in its 86th Annual General Meeting on Tuesday decided to name stands after India's Test & ODI captain Rohit Sharma , former India captain Ajit Wadekar , and ex-ICC, BCCI and MCA chief Sharad Pawar As per a proposal initially put forward by MCA's Apex Council member Milind Narvekar and seconded by another MCA Apex Council member Jitendra Awhad, the Divecha Pavilion Level 3 stand will be named after Rohit, who led India to the T20 World Cup title last year in USA & West Indies and the ICC Champions Trophy in UAE in Feb-March.The Grand Stand Level 4 will be named as the Ajit Wadekar Stand, after the ex-India captain, who captained India to maiden test series victories in West Indies and England in 1971.The Grand Stand Level 3 will be named as the Pawar Stand, as the NCP supremo, who is regarded as the MCA's 'mentor,' is widely respected for having a highly successful tenure as the MCA president from 2001 to 2013, and then from 2013-16, during which the association hosted the 2011 World Cup final at the revamped Wankhede Stadium.Speaking on the occasion, MCA president Ajinkya Naik said: ""Today’s decisions reflect our deep respect for the pillars of Mumbai cricket and our determination to build an even stronger future. These stands and this lounge shall forever echo the legacy of those who built Mumbai’s cricketing spirit — brick by brick, run by run.""""The MCA remains committed to preserving the legacy of stalwarts who have made invaluable contributions to the sport while continuing its mission of cricketing excellence,"" MCA secretary Abhay Hadap said in a statement.""It's an excellent piece of news for our family. It's a long-awaited and fitting tribute,"" Wadekar's son Prasad Wadekar told TOI.On March 20, soon after receiving the 'Lifetime Achievement Award for Administration' at the MCA's annual prize distribution function at the Sharad Pawar Indoor Academy Ground in BKC, veteran administrator Prof Ratnakar Shetty had urged the MCA to name at least something at the Wankhede Stadium after Wadekar and not ‘forget him.’Shetty, who served as an office-bearer at the MCA and then as a senior staffer at the BCCI, said in his speech, "" I have one request to make, please don't forget Ajit Wadekar. He deserves to be named at the Wankhede Stadium. He was one of the greatest India captains and I think it’s time that we give that honour to him also.”In Feb 2022, Shetty had requested the MCA to name the Grandstand above the ‘President’s Box’ at the Wankhede Stadium after Wadekar, who passed away in 2018. At that time, the widow of the former India captain, Rekha Ajit Wadekar, had urged the MCA to name the association’s upcoming museum after her husband.The MCA has also decided to name a lounge at the Wankhede after its former president Amol Kale, who passed away in 2024 in New York. ""Further, in a heartfelt tribute to Late Shri Amol Kale, the match day office at the MCA Pavilion will now be known as the MCA Office Lounge in memory of Shri Amol Kale,"" the MCA informed in a release.In a statement, the MCA said, ""The MCA successfully convened its 86th Annual General Meeting today, reaffirming its dedication to the growth and development of cricket in Mumbai.

Kolkata: Is Jose Molina ’s Mohun Bagan Super Giant the best team in Indian Super League ’s 11-year-old history?Finishing the 2024-2025 season with a remarkable Shield-Cup double, with record-breaking 19 wins and 52 goals, Mohun Bagan have set a benchmark for other teams to emulate. It’s perhaps ideal for them to complete the double with a come-from-behind 2-1 win over Bengaluru FC at their boisterous fortress — the Salt Lake Stadium — which was brought to its feet in game after game in salute of a genuinely special team at play and its repertoire of promise and panache.History will remember Sergio Lobera ’s Mumbai City FC as the first team to do the ISL double when, backed by the financial and technical might of the City Football Group which owns Man City, they achieved the target in Goa in 2020-2021 at a time when the world was existing in a bubble.Molina’s Bagan, in a way, made the real noise. Like Mumbai City of five seasons ago, they too have had a strong financial backing from principal team owner Sanjiv Goenka. Like Lobera’s side, Molina’s team also has had the strongest squad in the league. Bagan’s ascent to a triumphant finish to the league, many believe, looked destined before the season started rolling.Of course, Lobera’s FC Goa in 2019-20 and Des Buckingham’s Mumbai City in 2022-2023 were special in their own rights, but there was also a lingering lament that both these teams failed to explore their full potentiality.True that football, just like life, doesn’t always follow scripts of one’s liking. Credit to Molina for turning his team into a winning machine running on the engine of consistency, character and never-say-die mentality.Take for example the Spaniard’s use of substitutions in the second half here on Saturday, bringing Ashique Kuruniyan and Sahal Abdul Samad in place of an off-colour Liston Colaco and an ineffective Anirudh Thapa.“Sahal and Ashique had their moment in the final. You need great players on the bench who can wait for their moment and change the game,” Molina said after the match. “But at the end of the day, there’s no secret to success. It’s all about hard work and belief,” the Bagan coach pointed out.","Mohun Bagan beat Bengaluru FC to complete the ISL Shield and Cup double. Jose Molina’s Bagan, in a way, made the real noise.

Liverpool moved within touching distance of the Premier League title after a dramatic 2-1 win over West Ham at Anfield on Sunday, thanks to a late header from captain Virgil van Dijk . The result, coupled with Tottenham 's 2-4 defeat to Wolves, widened Liverpool’s lead at the top to 13 points over second-placed Arsenal with just six matches remaining.The Reds rebounded from a stuttering run of form — including defeats to Fulham, Newcastle and Paris Saint-Germain — with a gritty performance. Mohamed Salah ignited Liverpool’s charge in the 18th minute with a brilliant run from halfway, sliding a perfectly timed ball to Luis Diaz , who tapped in from close range.Though an unfortunate own goal from Andy Robertson — deflecting off Van Dijk — briefly pegged Liverpool back in the 86th minute, redemption followed swiftly. Van Dijk rose to meet Alexis Mac Allister’s corner just three minutes later, sealing a vital victory.“In the 18th minute, Mohamed Salah sprinted away on the halfway line, accelerating towards the West Ham area and caressing a perfectly weighted pass to Diaz, who had the simple task of slotting home from six yards,” the club noted.Liverpool could secure their 20th English league championship as early as April 20 if they defeat Leicester and Arsenal slip up at Ipswich.Elsewhere, Tottenham’s domestic woes deepened as Wolves cruised to victory at Molineux.

MUMBAI: A balmy Mumbai evening turned into a time capsule on Sunday a week back as Barcelona and Real Madrid legends rekindled one of football’s fiercest rivalries.While the scoreline read 2-0 in favour of the Real Madrid Leyendas, the night was much more than just goals. It was a celebration of football’s enduring legacy.Fans at the DY Patil Stadium in Navi Mumbai may not have filled every seat, but those in attendance were treated to a surreal experience.FIFA World Cup and UEFA Champions League winners graced the pitch. Xavi Hernandez , Rivaldo , Carles Puyol for Barcelona, and Luis Figo , Fernando Morientes, and Michael Owen for Madrid.Though older and past their competitive prime, the skill, footballing IQ, and passion were unmistakably intact.The match saw Morientes strike early with a trademark finish in the 15th minute, followed by David Barral doubling Madrid’s lead midway through the second half.Despite the deficit, Barça responded with composure and flair, orchestrated by Xavi and spearheaded by a lively Rivaldo.Phillip Cocu made his long-awaited return in a Blaugrana jersey, while Javier Saviola - who sported colours for both clubs in his playing days - added bursts of energy. Yet, the Catalans couldn’t find the finishing touch.On the Madrid side, the ball gravitated towards Figo, who looked sharp and determined, still very much the heart of Los Blancos.Every touch from the Portuguese legend was met with thunderous cheers or emphatic boos, depending on the fan allegiance, proof that the rivalry, though friendly in nature, still runs deep.What stood out beyond the game was the atmosphere in the stands. Indian fans, many of whom grew up idolising these players, sang, waved club banners, and relived memories from a golden era.Despite the rivalry, camaraderie was in abundance.Barca and Madrid fans shared stands, clicked pictures for each other, and engaged in healthy banter, a rare sight for a fixture historically defined by tension.While the match saw passionate attendance, the reach was limited: advertising, ticket pricing, and scheduling played a role.For such events to serve as a launchpad for football’s growth in India, there is a need for broader awareness, grassroots engagement, and structured interaction between legends and local players or coaches.Ultimately, Mumbai witnessed more than a match.It was a reminder of football’s power to inspire and unite. It was an evening where legends walked again and a generation of fans got a glimpse of their heroes not through screens, but in the flesh.","A week ago in Mumbai, football legends from Barcelona and Real Madrid reignited their rivalry in an exhibition match.

Kolkata: If winning is a habit, trust Mohun Bagan SG to make it a magical monotony at home this season.Let them face the biggest of challenges, let them have all sorts of odds stacked against them and let them be forced to trail with a title at stake. But invariably and unflinchingly, expect Jose Molina’s men to find a way out of the crisis and have the last laugh. Bengaluru FC learnt this in quite a compelling way at the Salt Lake Stadium. Gerard Zaragoza’s visitors were welcomed to the Bagan’s formidable fortress with a giant tifo from the home fans — “Champion’s home, entry prohibited.”Yet they silenced the thunderous crowd when Alberto Rodriguez was forced into conceding an own goal while dealing with Ryan Williams’ centre in the 49th minute.Jason Cummings’ penalty in the 72nd minute and Jamie Maclaren’s poacher’s goal six minutes into the first half of extra time were all Bagan required to script a turnaround in a 2-1 win here on Saturday and become the second team after Mumbai City FC to complete the Indian Super League double.A year ago, Bagan lost a similar opportunity to Mumbai City at the same place. But this season they seemed to be a different beast, assuming a juggernaut crushing one opponent after another at home to stretch their winning run to 14 matches. Two months after sealing their back-to-back Shield, they deservedly lifted the ISL Cup in front of 59,112 spectators.It’s quite a journey for Molina’s men. Nine months ago, BFC inflicted the heaviest defeat on them (0-3), putting Molina’s Bagan project under serious question mark. Now claiming the double at BFC’s expense should come as completion of a circle for the winners.Bagan began in a way culled straight from their playbook, setting the alarm bells ringing in the all-Indian rival defence with some trademark moves from the wings. Having somehow managed to weather that storm, BFC started to establish a more recognizable rhythm. BFC duly and deservedly went ahead soon after the restart. It started with another incisive run from Ryan Williams down the right and the Australian delivered an inviting cross. Rodriguez ended up miskicking it into his own.Molina sought intervention from the bench. The introduction of Ashique Kuruniyan and Sahal Abdul Samad brought pace and panache to the attack. When Cummings swivelled to take aim, it looked destined for a goal but Gurpreet denied him. But BFC caved in to Bagan’s constant pressure.As Maclaren tried to get past Chinglensana Singh following Cummings’ centre, the ball touched the BFC centre-back’s hands, forcing referee Senthil Nathan to point to the spot. Cummings made no mistake in beating Gurpreet.Maclaren then provided the coup de grace.",Mohun Bagan beat Bengaluru FC 2-1 to complete the ISL Shield and Cup double.

Poll Do you think Barcelona can maintain their unbeaten run for the rest of the season? No, they will face tougher opponents. Yes, they have the momentum.

Barcelona secured a crucial 1-0 victory against Leganes through Jorge Saenz's own goal on Saturday at Butarque stadium, extending their lead to seven points at the top of La Liga . The win maintains their impressive 24-match unbeaten run in 2025 and keeps them on track for a potential quadruple this season.Second-placed Real Madrid face Alaves on Sunday, now under pressure to close the gap on the league leaders.Barcelona's performance lacked their usual attacking flair, but they managed to grind out the win following their midweek 4-0 Champions League victory over Borussia Dortmund.""The fight and the mentality the team showed today was great,"" said Barcelona manager Hansi Flick. ""(Madrid) have a match tomorrow but we're only looking at ourselves, three points is good and we had a great week.""""In the end what is important in these games are three points,"" Barcelona defender Eric Garcia told DAZN. ""I think this is the type of game where the league is won... we're top of the table, which is where we want to be, and today we could extend that distance a bit.""The match was a reversal of fortunes from December when Leganes won 1-0 at Barcelona's home ground.Leganes created the best chance of a lackluster first half when Dani Raba set up Adria Altimira, whose shot was saved by Barcelona goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny.Barcelona suffered a setback when defender Alejandro Balde was forced off with a muscular injury before halftime.""Balde is not so good... (but) I will say nothing and we will wait until tomorrow,"" Flick commented on the injury.The breakthrough came after halftime when Raphinha's low cross was deflected into his own net by Saenz, with Robert Lewandowski's presence forcing the error.Barcelona created several chances afterward, with Fermin Lopez missing a clear opportunity and Lewandowski heading wide from Raphinha's cross.Leganes thought they had equalised through Raba's header, but it was ruled offside. Diego Garcia also missed a good chance late in the game.The match concluded with a crucial tackle by Inigo Martinez on former Barcelona player Munir El Haddadi, preserving the visitors' victory.""The last save (by Martinez) was unbelievable,"" said Flick. ""Everyone celebrated this as if it was a goal.""The defeat leaves Leganes in 19th place, two points from safety.""It's so tough... we leave with empty hands against a Barca that, while it's true they attacked against us, they were not as efficient as usual, and you leave with a bitter feeling because we put in a great performance,"" Leganes midfielder Renato Tapia told DAZN.""We can do it (stay up), and I think today we showed it.""Jules Kounde had Barcelona's only other notable attempt in the first half, with his deflected shot saved by Leganes goalkeeper Marko Dmitrovic.Teenage star Lamine Yamal forced a late save from Dmitrovic at his near post as Barcelona looked to secure their narrow advantage.Flick made tactical changes at halftime, bringing on Frenkie de Jong for Ronald Araujo and moving Eric Garcia into defense, which ultimately helped secure the victory.",Barcelona beat Leganes 1-0 at Butarque stadium in La Liga.

PANAJI: Two years after withdrawing a bid to host the AFC Asian Cup 2027, the All India Football Federation ( AIFF ) has now officially shown interest in hosting the 2031 edition of Asian football’s most prestigious national team tournament.With Praful Patel as president, India had launched an ambitious bid in 2020 to host the Asian Cup 2027. However, when the new executive committee took charge in 2022 with former India goalkeeper Kalyan Chaubey as president, the first major decision was to withdraw the bid, leaving Saudi Arabia as the only country left in the fray.Now, AIFF has officially notified the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) of its desire to organise the quadrennial event. Besides India, six others have expressed interest in hosting the continental showpiece. It includes Australia, Indonesia, South Korea, Kuwait, United Arab Emirates and a joint bid from Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan.While UAE, Australia, South Korea, Kuwait and Indonesia (jointly with three other countries in 2007) have all hosted the Asian Cup in the past, the Central Asian countries and India, if selected, will host the tournament for the first time.The decision is expected at the AFC Congress in 2026.",All India Football Federation (AIFF) has officially shown interest in hosting the 2031 edition of Asian football’s most prestigious national team tournament.

KOLKATA: Football , like life, moves in cycles. As Mohun Bagan SG and Bengaluru FC (BFC) prepare to bring down the curtain on the 2024-2025 season of Indian Super League (ISL) at the Salt Lake Stadium on Saturday, the two finalists will also relish the opportunity of completing a cycle of their journey in their own way.Mohun Bagan coach Jose Molina is someone who never lives in the past. But as he was sitting next to his Bengaluru counterpart Gerard Zaragoza during Friday’s news conference, it was tempting to take his mind to that September 28 evening when his team capitulated 0-3 at the Sree Kanteerava Stadium, their heaviest defeat of the league this term.Having lost the Durand Cup final earlier, the just-arrived Spanish coach was staring at uncertain times until his team turned things around in a record-breaking run and took the form of a juggernaut. Facing BFC again, the incentive is now greater for Molina and his League Shield winners at home -- a maiden ISL ‘double’ in the club’s history.Bagan missed a similar opportunity at home a year ago having lost the final to Mumbai City. At their formidable fortress where they are yet to taste defeat in the league, it would be a mammoth upset for them to be condemned to the periphery of a title-decider again.Zaragoza’s BFC, however, will enter the final with the battle-hardened look of a team, with hunger and determination to finish the season with a flourish. Not long ago BFC looked to be a team fearfully ambitious to give Bagan a run for their money but they lost the plot following a dreadful run in Janunary.Zaragoza, however, reflected on a brutal, wounding result that had happened further back to make sense of the occasion.“Last year, (it was) another April 11, we played Bagan at home and lost 0-4. Now we are here in the final and facing them. This is the difference for my team between then and now,” the BFC coach maintained on Friday.“Now we are in the final mood,” he added with a smile.Bagan will certainly have the edge with the support of their proverbial 12th man — the fans. It will be quite an audition for BFC at the Salt Lake Stadium. Yet, don’t expect it to be an uneven contest. Sunil Chhetri , even at the fag end of his illustrious career, is still showing hunger for goals and his stellar form, by Zaragoza’s own admission, is giving him a good headache whether to start him or use him as substitute.Bagan aim to take the centrestage this time. But Chhetri & Co. will be there, armed with some old tricks, to put a spanner in Bagan’s ambitions.",Mohun Bagan SG and Bengaluru FC will meet in the final of the 2024-2025 Indian Super League (ISL) The two finalists will also relish the opportunity of completing a cycle of their journey in their own way.

Formula E is now in its 11th season since its debut in 2014, and the electric motorsport has achieved impressive success, carving its own identity despite the dominance of Formula 1. One of the key indicators of this success is the growing grid of 11 teams and 22 drivers—one more than the 10 teams in F1. While drivers like Oliver Rowland and Pascal Wehrlein have previously tested their skills in F1, it seems they've found their true calling in the more sustainable and rapidly evolving Formula E.Oliver Rowland is currently leading the Formula E standings with 68 points, thanks to his victory at this season’s Mexico City E-Prix. Rowland had a brief stint with F1 team Williams in 2018 before transitioning to Formula E, where he raced for Mahindra Racing and then Nissan, ultimately making a name for himself with the Japanese team. Antonio Felix da Costa, driving for Porsche, is also a formidable force in the series. He currently sits in third place with 39 points this season, continuing to prove his prowess on the track.Maximilian Günther has made a strong impression after his move from Maserati MSG Racing to DS Penske. At the Jeddah E-Prix, Günther took pole position, posted the fastest lap, and ultimately clinched the victory. With this standout performance, he’s now eyeing an even higher position, currently sitting fourth in the driver standings.German driver Pascal Wehrlein, another former F1 racer, began his Formula E career with Mahindra Racing before joining Tag Heuer Porsche. After winning the Formula E World Championship last season, Wehrlein has maintained his strong form, registering the fastest lap in two races this season—at the São Paulo and Mexico City E-Prix. He’s currently in eighth place with 25 points but remains a serious contender with 7 career wins and 6 pole positions to his name.Mitch Evans, a consistent presence with Jaguar TCS Racing since 2016, continues to be among the best drivers in Formula E. He secured a win for Jaguar at the São Paulo E-Prix in December, propelling him to seventh in the standings with 25 points, keeping him in the mix for the championship.At just 20 years old, Taylor Barnard is quickly establishing himself as one of the brightest young talents in Formula E.

The current Formula E season is in full swing, fueling even more excitement for this electrifying motorsport, where cars now accelerate from 0-60 mph in a jaw-dropping 1.82 seconds. With 11 teams and 22 drivers battling it out across 16 races at 10 iconic global locations, the season will run through to July 27. Since its inception, the Nissan Formula E Team has led the charge, but a number of other teams are rapidly closing the gap in a sport that blends speed, innovation, and sustainability.All teams are currently using the Formula E Gen3 Evo cars fitted with Hankook tires. These cars can reach a top speed of 322 km/h—the fastest for any Formula E car—and accelerate even quicker than an F1 car.

Who founded Formula E

All eyes are currently on Formula 1 , as the season kicked off last month in Australia. However, there's another motorsport series that deserves just as much attention—one that not only thrills but is also in tune with the global movement for sustainability. Enter Formula E, the FIA-recognized single-seater world championship. Like Formula 1, it showcases high-speed racing, but with a key distinction: it’s environmentally conscious. Formula E uses all-electric cars, offering a cleaner, greener alternative to traditional motorsports while also driving innovation in the electric vehicle sector.Formula E cars are smaller, lighter, and require far fewer tire changes over the course of the season, which helps minimize their environmental footprint. And if you’re wondering whether these electric racers can deliver the same level of excitement as Formula 1, consider this: the Generation 3 Formula E car can reach speeds exceeding 100 km/h, proving that sustainability and speed can indeed go hand in hand.The ABB FIA Formula E Championship is currently in its 11th season, with the next race—the Miami ePrix—set for April 12. The season will run until July 27, with many more thrilling races scheduled across the globe.Formula 1 has been around since 1950 and has only evolved into hybrid vehicles relying on fossil fuels like E10 fuel (a mix of 90% petrol and 10% renewable ethanol). In contrast, Formula E is the motorsport of the 21st century after coming into existence in 2014. These races feature all-electric cars that run on powertrains converting energy from a battery into motion.One of the most striking differences between the two sports is how the cars handle tire changes. In Formula 1, teams often swap tires multiple times during a single race due to varying track conditions. In Formula E, however, teams are only allowed to change tires twice throughout the entire championship. The tires used in Formula E are made from natural rubber and recycled fibers, and are specifically designed to perform well in all weather conditions.Despite this difference, Formula E is by no means inferior. While a Formula 1 car can reach speeds in excess of 350 km/h, the new Formula E Gen3 Evo can reach 322 km/h, but it can accelerate faster than a F1 car. It can go from 0-100 km/h in 1.86 seconds., faster than many Formula 1 cars.Although both series use the same chassis, battery, and tires, the real performance differences come from the powertrains provided by each team. There is one aspect where Formula 1 still holds an edge, primarily due to the electric car's battery limitations. As the battery depletes, an electric car loses speed, requiring a pit stop to recharge in a flash. A Formula 1 car, on the other hand, can maintain top speed even with a quarter tank of fuel.Additionally, Formula E cars must be kept light—around 284 kg for the battery, which accounts for one-third of the car's weight that’s fixed at 840 kg, including the driver.Despite the technical differences, Formula E has its own appeal. Even Red Bull driver Max Verstappen has acknowledged how difficult it can be to drive the RB21. In comparison, electric cars in Formula E are simpler, with single-speed transmission and no gear shifts necessary, unlike the multiple gears in a F1 car.Currently, Formula E features 11 teams, with 22 drivers. Unlike Formula 1, where the top speeds are often the focus, Formula E records are typically based on average race speeds. The fastest race in Formula E history took place in Cape Town in 2023, with an average speed of 132.2 km/h.Practice sessions are held on Friday and Saturday, lasting 30 minutes each, giving drivers a chance to fine-tune their performance.Qualifying: Drivers are split into two groups based on their championship standing. Each group has a 10-minute session to set the fastest lap at 300 kW. The top 4 from each group then advance to the ""duels"" stage, where drivers face off head-to-head at 350 kW in a series of quarter-finals, semi-finals, and a final. The winner of the final claims pole position.The top ten drivers receive points using the standard FIA system (25–18–15–12–10–8–6–4–2–1). The pole position winner earns an additional 3 points, while the driver setting the fastest lap (if they finish in the top ten) receives 1 point.Drivers can deploy a combined 8 minutes of Attack Mode during the race. It provides additional power, activated by driving through a designated area of the circuit off the racing line. All Attack Modes must be used before the end of the race.A new feature has been introduced this season. It requires all drivers to make a mandatory 30-second pit stop to recharge their car's batteries at 600 kW. This adds 3.85 kWh of energy (around 10% more) to be used for the remainder of the race.Formula E was founded by Spanish businessman Alejandro Agag, who serves as the company's Chairman, while Jeff Dodds is the Chief Executive Officer. Many may not realize that Warner Bros. Discovery is among its shareholders.","Formula E is the FIA-recognized single-seater world championship.

Japan beat Canada to qualify for finals

Tokyo:

Pune: For Indian women’s tennis team captain Vishaal Uppal , it was “mission accomplished” after his team secured their World Group Playoff berth in the Billie Jean King Cup .“At the start, I sent the team a message saying our mission is Project Playoff. And it’s mission accomplished,” Uppal said on Saturday after India beat South Korea 2-1 in their last round-robin match to finish in the top two in Asia-Oceania Group 1 .“We have just proven when we become ‘We’, what we can achieve. It’s truly amazing. I know I was tough on them this week. I pushed them. But we had Project Playoff. It was a team effort,” said the former Davis Cupper.Shrivalli Rashmikaa played a stellar role as she won all her five singles matches, but Uppal emphasised on the team bonding, which he said played a vital role in lifting the Hyderabad girl’s performance. “She beat a lot of higher ranked players this week,” he said.“We’re playing a team competition, and for her to come out and perform like that, I think the credit has to go to the entire team,” he said. “When Shrivalli beat (Hong Yi) Cody Wong (of Hong Kong) the other day and Ankita ran on to the court and hugged her. That says a lot.” Ankita Raina played her part in the team’s success, combining with fellow senior Prarthana Thombare , to clinch the decisive doubles rubber against Korea. “It was deja-vu for me. When it became one-all against Korea, I remembered the mindset I had in Dubai for doubles, and tried to keep that momentum,” she said, referring to the last time India advanced to the playoffs in 2020.“And we were aggressive because as we all know that in doubles, the momentum can change quickly,” she said, adding, “We really came together. We are traveling and playing by ourselves, but there’s this one week every year when we come together as a team.”Prarthana, Asian Games doubles bronze medallist with Sania Mirza in 2014, hit the winning shot — a sizzling forehand service return down the line. And she was modest about it all.“Sahaja (Yamalapalli) and Shrivalli were fighting their hearts out. And it gives us the confidence,” the 30-year-old from Barshi said. “As much as it is ours, it is each and every person who wants to play tennis. It’s their win as well.”Ena Shibahara and Shuko Aoyama defeated Kayla Cross and Rebecca Marino 6-3, 5-7, 6-2 in the decisive doubles match to secure Japan a spot in the Billie Jean King Cup Finals on Sunday.The BJK Cup Finals will be played in Shenzhen in September.","India beat South Korea 2-1 in their last round-robin match to finish in the top two in Asia-Oceania Group 1.

Alcaraz wins

Monte Carlo Masters

Carlos Alcaraz had an outstanding start to his clay-court season last week, clinching the Monte Carlo title on Sunday for the first time in his career.After missing this Masters 1000 event last year, he earned the full 1,000 ranking points when he beat Lorenzo Musetti in the final, elevating his total from 6,720 to 7,720 points.As a result, Alcaraz moves one place in the latest ATP rankings (April1 4), moving up from No. 3 to No. 2, surpassing Alexander Zverev, who lost his first match in Monte Carlo this year. Zverev’s ranking points drop from 7,645 to 7,595, causing him to fall one place.This marks Alcaraz's first return to the Top 2 since October 28 last year, when he was also ranked No. 2; he had spent 23 consecutive weeks at No. 3 since then. Overall, this is his 89th week in the Top 2, with 36 weeks at No. 1 and 53 weeks at No. 2.Alcaraz also narrows the gap between him and current No. 1 Jannik Sinner, who is suspended presently, from 3,610 points (10,330 to 6,720) to 2,210 points (9,930 to 7,720).Sinner missed Monte Carlo while defending semi-final points as he serves a three-month suspension for two failed dope tests last year. Although Alcaraz can’t overtake him before Sinner returns on the tour in Rome, winning both Barcelona and Madrid in the coming weeks could reduce that gap to just 720 points, putting the No. 1 ranking within reach in Italy.In addition to Alcaraz and Zverev's place swap, there was movement elsewhere in the ATP Top 10: Alex de Minaur made the biggest jump, climbing from No. 10 to No. 7 — just one spot shy of his career-high of No. 6 — after reaching the semifinals of his second Masters 1000 event.Andrey Rublev also rose from No. 9 back to No. 8, while Daniil Medvedev returned to the Top 10 after being outside for two weeks, moving from No. 11 to No. 9. This marked the 2021 US Open champion's first absence from the elite group in over two years, dating back to February 2023.Meanwhile, Musetti closed in on a Top 10 debut, climbing from No. 16 to No. 11 — surpassing his previous career - high of No. 15 — after reaching the finals of his first Masters 1000 event. He’s now just 15 points behind the No. 10-ranked Ruud, with scores of 3,215 to 3,200.""I'm just really happy to have won Monte Carlo for the first time,"" Alcaraz said. ""It's been a really difficult week with a lot of difficult situations. I'm really proud of myself, how I've dealt with everything. It's been a really difficult month for me on the court and outside. Coming here and seeing how the whole hard work has paid off, I'm really happy.""This victory represents Alcaraz's first clay court success since his French Open triumph last season, with his only other clay court appearance resulting in a silver medal at the Paris Olympics.Musetti, appearing in his first Masters 1000 final after defeating top 10 players Stefanos Tsitsipas and Alex de Minaur, started strongly but faced physical challenges as the match progressed.The Italian received medical treatment for his right leg when trailing 0-3 in the final set, though he continued to play despite the injury.""It is not the way I would have wanted to win a match,"" Alcaraz said. ""Lorenzo's been through a really tough week, long and intense matches. I feel sorry for him, one of the best results he has done. To end like this is not easy. Hopefully it's not serious and he's 100 percent soon.""""It was probably one of my best tournaments so far,"" Musetti said, who won bronze at last year's Olympics behind Alcaraz and gold medalist Novak Djokovic. ""I'm disappointed I couldn't finish the match in the best way, for the crowd. You deserve it so I will keep going and try and come back for revenge.""The match began with Musetti dropping his opening service game but immediately breaking back and taking the first set, capitalising on Alcaraz's six unforced errors.Alcaraz's game improved significantly in the second set, which he won convincingly before completing the victory with a dominant final set.Both players will continue their clay court preparations at the Barcelona Open next week as they build toward the French Open at the end of May.","Carlos Alcaraz won the Monte Carlo Masters for the first time in his career. He beat Lorenzo Musetti in the final, earning the full 1,000 ranking points. He moves up from No. 3 to No. 2, surpassing Alexander Zverev.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120268962,imgsize-60052,width-400,resizemode-4/Carlos-Alcaraz-Monte-Carlo-champion-Reuters.jpg"

Carlos Alcaraz captured his first Monte Carlo Masters title on Sunday with a commanding 3-6, 6-1, 6-0 win over Italy’s Lorenzo Musetti , marking his sixth Masters 1000 crown and most significant title since Wimbledon 2024.The 21-year-old Spaniard, a four-time Grand Slam champion, overcame a slow start to dominate the final two sets, showcasing his trademark intensity and athleticism. Alcaraz had lost in the opening round on his only previous appearance at Monte Carlo in 2022 but returned stronger this year.“It’s been a really difficult week and a tough month for me, both on and off the court,” said Alcaraz. “I’m proud of how I dealt with everything.”Musetti, playing in his first Masters 1000 final, started brightly, rallying from an early break to take the opening set. However, the Italian began struggling with a leg issue early in the third set, requiring medical attention at 0-3. From that point, Alcaraz never looked back, sealing the decider without dropping a game.Despite the defeat, Musetti earned a rankings boost to World No. 11 and valuable experience ahead of the French Open . “It was probably one of my best tournaments so far,” he said. “I’m disappointed I couldn’t finish stronger, but I’ll come back for revenge.”Alcaraz will rise to World No. 2, overtaking Alexander Zverev, as the clay-court season intensifies. With Roland Garros on the horizon, his Monte Carlo triumph sets the tone for another strong title push.","Carlos Alcaraz wins first Monte Carlo Masters title.

Poll Who do you think will win the Monte Carlo Masters final? Lorenzo Musetti Carlos Alcaraz

Carlos Alcaraz secured his first Monte Carlo Masters final appearance by defeating fellow Spaniard Alejandro Davidovich Fokina 7-6 (7/2), 6-4 on Saturday. He will face 13th-seeded Italian Lorenzo Musetti , who overcame Australian eighth seed Alex de Minaur 1-6, 6-4, 7-6 (7/4) in the second semi-final.Four-time Grand Slam champion Alcaraz is seeking his first Masters title since his victory at Indian Wells last year. His only title this season came at the ATP 500 event in Rotterdam in February.""I knew how well Davidovich Fokina had played in Monte Carlo so I had to be ready to fight,"" said Alcaraz.""It's been a long time since I've had the chance to win a title on clay and I can't wait to try my luck again here,"" Alcaraz said, referencing his Olympic final loss to Novak Djokovic in August.""At the beginning of the week, the first tournament on clay, you have to get used to the conditions,"" he added. ""The ball comes different. You know, the play on clay is different... I'm just really happy to get the level that I wanted at the beginning of the week.""Alcaraz emerged as the tournament favourite following early exits by top seed Alexander Zverev and Novak Djokovic, while world number one Jannik Sinner remains suspended due to a doping ban.""The first question, you know, since Jannik was unable to play tournaments, a lot of people were asking me and talking about, how important (the) moment that I have ahead is to reach the number one (ranking) again or to win tournaments or whatever,"" Alcaraz said. ""I was thinking so much about it instead of playing my good tennis and enjoy the time that I have, stepping on the court and playing matches.""The 21-year-old Spaniard started strongly against world number 42 Davidovich Fokina, securing an early break. However, Davidovich Fokina fought back to level at 5-5 before losing the first-set tiebreak 7/2.Alcaraz broke early again in the second set and maintained his advantage despite Davidovich Fokina saving 13 break points and four match points.In the other semi-final, Musetti overcame a difficult start where he lost all four service games in the first set. The Italian regained his composure in the second set, breaking De Minaur in the ninth game.The decisive third set saw multiple service breaks before heading to a tiebreak, where Musetti prevailed on his first match point when De Minaur hit a forehand into the net.""It means so much. Honestly, it's unexpected,"" said Musetti, who will enter the world's top 10 if he wins the final. ""If I look back where we started, at the beginning of the week, I was of course dreaming to be in final and to have the chance to play for the top 10, for the title, for a lot of things.""The final will be a rematch between Alcaraz and Musetti, with the Spaniard winning their last three encounters. However, Musetti won their only previous final meeting in Hamburg in 2022.""For sure the key of that match was the mental part,"" added Musetti.

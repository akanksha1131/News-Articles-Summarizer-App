Poll Do You Agree With Graeme Smith's Concern About a Two-Tier System in Test Cricket? Top Teams Will Raise Standards All Teams Need Equal Support

The debate around the idea of a two-tier system for Tests is one of most discussed topics in world cricket at the moment, with former players voicing themselves out with strong views. In that line, ex-South Africa captain Graeme Smith has expressed his disapproval of the idea, saying that it leaves teams other than the ""top three nations"" -- India, Australia and England -- struggling.""My answer to that would be we ( South Africa ) are in the World Test Championship (WTC) final; we've got a chance to win the mace. I think that's the key,"" Smith said while talking to Sky Sports, answering how the move, if it happens, will affect South African cricket.The Proteas have topped the WTC table for 2023-25 to qualify for the WTC final against Australia in June this year at Lord's.""You've got to do what you've got to do, and South Africa have done that. I think over the last couple of years, their win percentages are actually pretty decent if you go and look over a period of time,"" said Smith.Smith said it doesn't happen in any sport where the top three nations are seen facing off ""all the time"" and that there needs to be a balance that allows other nations to play the big teams.The two-tier system for Test cricket will separate the top teams from the rest, which will see the smaller teams playing each other in the lower division.""I also do feel for the ICC . I was just looking at a note this morning at how much England and India are playing each other over the next period, and Australia and vice versa. It gets extremely hard for the other nations...,"" Smith added.""India are probably the best because they are commercially so reliable for the other nations. But where do you find the top three nations playing each other all the time? And you can only imagine in the next FTP cycle how that's been tied up in the background.""He said for the betterment of the sport, teams like South Africa, West Indies and Sri Lanka need to be backed to keep raising their level of cricket.""How does the ICC create a structure that's fair in the top three's eyes? I think what world cricket needs is, it needs South Africa strong, needs the West Indies strong, needs Sri Lanka to get better.""Otherwise, can you see a world where there are only three nations playing cricket in the future?"" he asked to conclude.","Ex-South Africa captain Graeme Smith has expressed his disapproval of the idea of a two-tier system for Test cricket.

NEW DELHI: Australian tennis player Nick Kyrgios, known for his polarizing personality, has withdrawn from an exhibition match against Novak Djokovic due to an abdominal strain.This development raises concerns about his fitness for the upcoming Australian Open , which commences this weekend.Kyrgios made his return to tennis last week in Brisbane after an 18-month hiatus, during which he underwent knee surgery and wrist reconstruction.However, his comeback was short-lived as he exited in the first round after a gruelling three-set encounter with the rising French star Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard. Kyrgios acknowledged experiencing pain following the match.In addition to his singles appearance, Kyrgios also participated in two doubles matches alongside Djokovic.The two were scheduled to face each other in a charity singles match on Thursday at the iconic Rod Laver Arena in Melbourne Park. However, Kyrgios has now withdrawn from this exhibition due to the abdominal strain.In an Instagram post, Kyrgios revealed that he had undergone an ultrasound, which confirmed a grade 1 abdominal strain. He expressed his intention to rest and do everything possible to recover in time for the Australian Open.""Unfortunately won't be able to play my good friend this Thursday on the 9th as I've had an ultrasound on my abdominal and have a grade 1 strain,"" he wrote on Instagram.""Will be resting and doing everything I can to be OK by the Aus Open.""At 29 years old, Kyrgios remains a crowd favourite at the Australian Open, having reached his maiden major singles final at Wimbledon in 2022, where he ultimately lost to Djokovic in four sets.Despite his undeniable talent, Kyrgios has struggled to achieve consistent success in an era dominated by the likes of Djokovic, Rafael Nadal, and Roger Federer, partly due to his sometimes volatile temperament.As the Australian Open approaches, all eyes will be on Kyrgios's recovery, with fans eagerly anticipating his participation in the prestigious tournament on home soil.",Nick Kyrgios withdraws from exhibition match against Novak Djokovic due to abdominal strain.

Dilip Vengsarkar: IND vs AUS SCG pitch substandard,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/india-in-australia/ind-vs-aus-scg-pitch-substandard-says-dilip-vengsarkar/articleshow/117038906.cms,"Image credit: SCG

MUMBAI: Former India skipper Dilip Vengsarkar has criticised the seamer-friendly pitch at the Sydney Cricket Ground (SCG) for the final Test of BGT, which saw Australia beat India by six wickets inside three days.Vengsarkar wants ICC, which conducts the World Test Championship , to take charge of Test match pitches, just like it does in its global white-ball tournaments, to ensure “good quality Test cricket” for the numerous fans who still throng to watch Test matches, as was evident in Australia.“The quality of the pitch at Sydney was substandard. Just like some of the (turning) wickets that we offer for Tests in India are substandard. I think that the time has come, if you want to see good quality cricket, you need to ensure good pitches at the highest level. It’s time ICC monitors the preparation of Test match wickets. They should fly down their pitch experts/curators for every Test staging centre at least 10 days before a Test. This is essential so that people get their money’s worth, and the game, particularly Test cricket, becomes popular,” Vengsarkar told TOI.“If you don’t do this, every country will prepare poorquality pitches to ensure maximum points for the WTC. The whole purpose of conducting the WTC is defeated,” the former India chief selector stated.While Australia’s Steve Smith said that he hadn’t batted on a Sydney pitch with so much grass in his life, Sunil Gavaskar was heavily critical of the pitch.“The Sydney pitch was heavily loaded in favour of pacers. It’s tough to bat on these kinds of strips. It’s easy to criticise the batsmen for not scoring runs, but the fact is the pitch was substandard. There was so much grass on the pitch that the cows could’ve grazed on it! Unfortunately for us, (Jasprit) Bumrah got injured, otherwise Australia wouldn’t have been able to chase 162. But my point is, ‘Who wants to see teams get out or 150 or 180?’ People come to watch good cricket,” Vengsarkar said.",Former India skipper Dilip Vengsarkar has criticised the seamer-friendly pitch at the Sydney Cricket Ground (SCG) for the final Test of BGT.

'A masterstroke!': Allan Donald excited for Dinesh Karthik in SA20

Jacques Kallis answers what makes SA20 special

Will Smeed thrilled to join Pretoria Capitals for SA20

In January 2025, at the very same time, five T20 leagues will be played across the globe. Australia's Big Bash, New Zealand's Super Smash and Bangladesh Premier League, already underway, will continue into the new year. UAE's ILT20 and South Africa's SA20 will kick-start in the first fortnight.It presents a challenge not just for the league organisers but also the players. Where should they play? What is the motivation - the intensity of the competition? How about the stature of a league itself? Or, the vibe of the team? How much does the location matter? Is it the hefty salaries that go with it? For some, all of them do. Many players, unfairly labelled as T20 'mercenaries', would even zip across the globe to play for different teams in different leagues.Every T20 league tries to position itself as the best, the most competitive and lure the best players in the world. Also in that race is SA20 which will get its third season underway from 9 January.What makes SA20 special and a catch? ""First of all, just travelling to South Africa, for people from other places around the world is a joy. I think it's a great country to travel to. There's a wonderful diversity in the landscape. You've got the mountains, the bush belt, the game viewing, you go to the coasts and you have sunny beaches. There's fantastic restaurants, great hospitality, great accommodation,"" explained SA20 Ambassador AB de Villiers in a group interaction ahead of the season.""It's already just a nice tour for any player to come from a cricketing perspective. I think the crowds are different to anywhere else in the world, the grounds are built differently. There's a lot of grass embankments at Boland Park, Centurion, at Newlands, St George's Park, Durban's Kingsmead. You don't see that very often around the world. There's a wonderful atmosphere because of that. Over the weekends, you'll see barbecues happening outside the stadium and just a fantastic atmosphere leading to the game. The crowd, attendance, not so much in numbers, but the atmosphere they create, the sing alongs. They bring a different atmosphere to anywhere else in the world,"" he added.Most of the players who will be part of the SA20 Season 3 have made their way to respective venues in South Africa. The practices are underway, team bonding activities have begun after the New Year's festivities with the families. Sunrisers Eastern Cape come in as the two-time defending champions, winning both of the first two editions.AB de Villiers, nicknamed Mr. 360, is stoked to see a bigger tournament than before with plenty of international firepower. Unlike the previous season, there is no clash with the international team's commitments and many of England's top players have made the journey.He argued that it is the growing availability of foreign talent that suggests which way the tournament is headed. He used IPL's example to illustrate the point.""I think we can just keep growing with regards to the overseas players. I think that's a large part of the success of the IPL over the years. Every year since 2008, the overseas contingents seem to get stronger and stronger. You get the best players in the world and best players in India and that combination makes for great cricket. So I think for Graeme (Smith, the SA20 Commissioner) and his team, moving forward is just to keep pushing hard, get the best quality players over here.""""I think the group of overseas players that are joining this season is stronger than seasons one and two, so it's tracking in the right direction. And then I would love to see more Indian players involved. We know Dinesh Karthik will be involved this year, which is fantastic, and it's great for the tournament. Hopefully the BCCI (Board of Control for Cricket in India) will allow us to get more Indian players in the future to come and join in the fun of SA20,"" said ABD.When put on the spot and asked to name the Indians he would love to bring in, he was quick to include Jasprit Bumrah, Rishabh Pant, his ex-Royal Challengers Bengaluru colleague Virat Kohli, Shubman Gill, Suryakumar Yadav. However, BCCI's rules bar current India players from playing in overseas leagues. Once they retire, though, players can do as they please - as is the case for Karthik who will play for Paarl Royals. AB de Villier's snap list of retired players for SA20 included Robin Uthappa, Karthik, Zaheer Khan, Irfan Pathan and Yuzvendra Chahal, who, he joked, ""would have no choice.""For now, SA20 gets underway with some of the top talents in the world on Thursday with Sunrisers Eastern Cape taking on MI Cape Town.","SA20 will get its third season underway from 9 January. Sunrisers Eastern Cape come in as the two-time defending champions. Unlike the previous season, there is no clash with the international team's commitments.

Sri Lanka's 1996 World Cup-winning captain Arjuna Ranatunga has voiced his apprehension regarding a proposed restructuring of Test cricket by cricket's dominant forces: India, England, and Australia.This restructuring involves a two-tiered system, prioritising matches between these three nations. This could potentially hinder the development of cricket in smaller cricketing nations, according to Ranatunga.The Sydney Morning Herald reported that the cricket board heads of these three countries are scheduled to meet with ICC officials this month.This meeting will discuss the proposed system and an increase in the frequency of Test matches among the ""Big Three.""The proposal suggests these teams play each other twice every three years, instead of the current once every four years.This increased frequency could limit matches against other nations like Sri Lanka, Pakistan, South Africa, and the West Indies.Ranatunga criticized the plan, viewing it as prioritizing financial gain over the sport's integrity.""I understand the economics. Such a move will certainly line the pockets of the three boards, but sport isn't just about Pounds, Dollars, and Rupees. Administrators must nurture and protect the game, not just fatten their coffers,"" Ranatunga told Telecom Asia Sport.Ranatunga emphasised the potential negative impact on emerging cricketing nations.He highlighted the performance of West Indies fast bowler Shamar Joseph , whose contribution was key to his team's victory against Australia at the Gabba last year.""It's tough as nails to beat the Aussies at the Gabba, but this bloke was sensational. I'm sure even Australian fans appreciated that display of raw talent. Why would you want to deny players like him a chance by excluding other nations?""The two-tier system could limit opportunities for players from smaller nations to compete against top-tier teams. This limitation could hinder their development and deprive fans of potentially exciting upsets.Ranatunga criticized the increasing corporatization of cricket. He blamed administrators focused on financial gains for neglecting the spirit of the game.""To run cricket, you don't necessarily have to be a former player, but you do need to understand the spirit of the game – its values and its rich history. Unfortunately, when corporates run the show, everything is reduced to numbers and bottom lines,"" he said.He urged cricket administrators to prioritize the game's global appeal and inclusivity. A corporate-centric approach could alienate both fans and players.Ranatunga called on India, a highly influential cricketing nation, to adopt a more inclusive and forward-thinking approach.He commended former Indian cricket administrators like Jagmohan Dalmiya, Raj Singh Dungarpur, Sharad Pawar, and Shashank Manohar for balancing India's interests with the overall well-being of international cricket.""India has always been at the forefront of shaping world cricket. Leaders like Jagmohan Dalmiya, Raj Singh Dungarpur, Sharad Pawar, and Shashank Manohar had Indian interests at heart, but they also understood the broader picture. That's the kind of vision we need from India today – not this inward, self-serving approach.""As a financially powerful force in cricket, India bears a responsibility to ensure the survival and growth of all forms of cricket, especially Test cricket.Ranatunga urged the ICC and cricket administrators to reject the ""Big Three's"" proposal.He advocated for a more balanced and inclusive schedule. He suggested a system that provides all nations, regardless of size, the opportunity to compete at the highest level.""Cricket is more than a business. It’s a sport that unites nations, inspires young talent, and creates unforgettable memories. It's the duty of those in power to preserve its essence, not to exploit it for short-term gains.""Ranatunga believes this approach is essential for preserving the essence of the sport.","Sri Lanka's 1996 World Cup-winning captain Arjuna Ranatunga has voiced his apprehension regarding a proposed restructuring of Test cricket by cricket's dominant forces.

NEW DELHI: Team India witnessed a rollercoaster Test season which came to an end with a 1-3 defeat in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy . The loss also marked the end of India's decade-long dominance in the series, as Australia reclaimed the coveted trophy after 10 years.India began their Test season with authority against Bangladesh at MA Chidambaram Stadium. The first Test saw India register a massive 280-run victory, thanks to a collective batting effort and the spin duo of Ravichandran Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja dismantling Bangladesh's lineup.The caravan moved to Kanpur, where India completed the sweep in a match that will be remembered for the ages. Despite only 35 overs being bowled across the first three days, the hosts pulled off an incredible heist.But their push for an unthinkable victory reflected Team India's unwavering mindset - a determination to strive for success regardless of the situation.India facing only 312 balls in this match marked the second-fewest deliveries they have faced — and the fourth-fewest overall - to secure a Test victory, trailing only their 281-ball chase against South Africa in Cape Town last year.New Zealand were up against India in their next assignment at home for a three-match series. Going by India's current form and New Zealand's past record on Indian soil, the series was expected to be a straightforward challenge for the hosts.However, India were dealt a stunning blow in the first innings of the opening Test in Bengaluru, collapsing to a mere 46 runs - their lowest-ever Test total at home.New Zealand capitalised with a strong batting performance, securing a substantial lead and ultimately chasing down the target with ease. The victory marked New Zealand's first Test win in India since 1988.What unfolded in the next Test at Pune was something India hadn't experienced in over a decade, as New Zealand handed them their first home Test series defeat since 2012.New Zealand's spinners, particularly Mitchell Santner, played a pivotal role, with Santner taking 13 wickets in the match. India's batting lineup struggled to counter the spin threat, leading to a significant defeat.The third and last Test of the series at Wankhede Stadium in Bengaluru brought no change of fortunes for the hosts as New Zealand did the unthinkable and inflicted a first 3-0 whitewash on India at home with 25-run victory.The focus then shifted to one of the biggest rivalries in world cricket - the Border-Gavaskar Trophy. India, who reigned supreme on the previous two tours Down Under, were once again tipped to hand a shocker to Australia in their own backyard.And India rightly lived up to the expectations as they secured a commanding victory in the first Test at Perth, winning by 295 runs.However, Australia bounced back in the second Test (day-night) in Adelaide, achieving a 10-wicket win. The third Test in Brisbane concluded in a draw, setting the stage for a competitive remainder of the series.However, the cricketing world was met with surprise after the completion of Gabba Test as star Indian spinner Ravichandran Ashwin announced his retirement from all forms of international cricket with immediate effect.In the fourth Test at Melbourne, Australia clinched a 184-run victory to go 2-1 up in the five-match series, leaving a lot to ponder ahead of the New Year Test in Sydney.On the eve of the Sydney Test, Indian cricket fans were taken aback when the out-of-form skipper, Rohit Sharma, opted to 'stood out' from the match to make way for Shubman Gill.

Following a challenging start in the Australian ODI series , she bounced back brilliantly with an impressive century (105 off 109 balls) in the third match. This performance set her up for success in the subsequent West Indies series at home.The Indian opener continued her excellent form in the T20I series against the West Indies, producing three consecutive half-centuries that guided India to a 2-1 series victory. Her consistent batting and ability to maintain momentum throughout innings highlighted her status as a premier batter in women's cricket.Her statistics reflect her excellence: 270 runs in six ODIs at 45.00 average and 91.52 strike rate, alongside 193 runs in three T20Is, averaging 64.33 with a strike rate of 59.50.Sutherland's December performances helped maintain Australia's undefeated ODI record. The all-rounder scored two centuries - 110 against India in Perth and an unbeaten 105 versus New Zealand in Wellington. Her batting displayed both technical skill and tactical awareness.Sutherland's bowling proved equally valuable, with a standout performance of 4/39 in the second ODI against India. Her December statistics were impressive: 269 runs (average 67.25, strike rate 113.98) and nine wickets (average 16.22, economy 3.85) across five ODIs. These contributions earned her two Player of the Series awards.Mlaba achieved a historic milestone in South Africa's Test match against England in Bloemfontein. She became South Africa's first female cricketer to secure a 10-wicket haul in Tests, with outstanding figures of 10 wickets at 15.70.Despite South Africa's defeat, her spin bowling excellence stood out.

I was fortunate to have some of the finest talent in the age-group cricket from back home at my disposal,"" the ICC quoted Verma as saying in a release.""While it was simply brilliant to lead that talented lot, it was more about playing together as a unit, sharing a solid camaraderie and making sure everyone is in great spirits as we looked to enjoy ourselves in the middle.""Obviously, winning the tournament – the first of its kind in women's age-group cricket – as a captain will remain one of the best moments of my cricketing career; something that I will remember forever. It is safe to say that I was pretty emotional as we were about to lift that trophy and started to celebrate a special triumph,"" she added.The second ICC U19 Women's T20 World Cup is scheduled in Malaysia from January 18 to February 2, with 16 nations participating.The inaugural tournament introduced several talented Indian players to international cricket, notably leg-spinner Parshavi Chopra with 11 wickets and batter Shweta Sehrawat , who topped the run charts with 297 runs.Verma emphasises that this competition provides an excellent platform for young cricketers to demonstrate their abilities and compete against international talent.""It is a massive help to play in a tournament like this. It is a big opportunity to showcase your talent on the world stage. It has all the potential to fast track some of the young and promising cricketers to represent their respective countries with the senior teams,"" said the 20-year-old.The tournament's third edition is confirmed for Bangladesh and Nepal in 2027, which Verma considers essential for women's cricket development.""It is extremely crucial to have a U19 Women's tournament in a structure that only had senior women's tournaments before this,"" she said.""It is a win-win for the age-group teams as well as the senior sides where you have a larger pool of players available for selection.""There is healthy competition and that always is a welcome sign. The U19 Women's tournament structure is a need of the hour as it also acts as a crucial segway to move into the senior sides. So, it is not only massive for the age-group cricket but also for the overall growth of the game.""With Nepal, Nigeria, Samoa, Scotland and United States qualifying through regional competitions, Verma encourages the upcoming players to maximise this opportunity.""My best wishes are with them. Having played the tournament in its first-ever edition, I can vouch for the fact that it will be a fantastic experience for the players who are going to take part in the second edition of this tournament,"" Verma said.""The message for me for everyone who is going to be a part in this year's tournament is very simple: enjoy this experience and make the most of it. This could just be a start for something bigger but live in the moment and enjoy the process.""",Shafali Verma captained India to victory in the inaugural U19 Women's World Cup. The 20-year-old says it was a significant milestone in her cricket journey.

Referees in firing line: AIFF wants India to embrace tech,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/top-stories/referees-in-firing-line-aiff-wants-india-to-embrace-tech/articleshow/117039653.cms,"Representational photo

PANAJI: The All India Football Federation ( AIFF ) has introduced a merit table for referees with ‘Key Match Incidents’ being measured by independent assessors at the end of every round in the Indian Super League and I-League. The merit table will be used to promote and relegate referees from the top two divisions.If a referee has blundered, he would be taken off “to protect the integrity of the competition,” according to Trevor Kettle, the former Premier League assistant referee who’s now the federation’s chief refereeing officer (CRO).Match officials, he pointed out, have been removed from panels this season because they’ve made clear blunders.Among other categories, the KMIs include denial of an obvious goal-scoring opportunity, disputed goal — awarded and disallowed — penalties, offside judgment and technical area removal.“Do referees make mistakes, yes, they do,” Kettle told TOI over a video call. “I am as disappointed as anybody when I see a referee make an error. We don’t want that to happen. Are we arrogant enough to say that we get everything right? No, we’re not. But errors occur.”According to the AIFF CRO, in his first year (2022-23), the key match incident accuracy increased to around 80% from the 72% that tentative data had previously suggested.Last year, it was around 83-84, and at the end of the season touched 85.“This year, currently in the ISL, it’s around 82% and in the I-League, since we are doing it for the first time this season (and there are less cameras), it’s just above 85%.“To make the transition, to jump from 80-85% into the high 90s, there is only one solution. That’s exactly why other countries, top leagues have introduced technology, because you can rectify the decision at the game, not retrospectively. I want as much information available to match officials to get the decisions right on the day, not retrospectively (watching on video and accessing performance),” said Kettle. That brings the video assistant referee (VAR) system into focus.“If you bring technology into the game, you will get more and more accurate decisions,” said Kettle, who has officiated in over 800 professional games and at every English club ground. “It provides referees more confidence to make decisions. As football has exponentially expanded, commercially too, in the last two decades, you have more and more cameras coming into the field of play. The more cameras that you have, the more chance of proving a referee wrong.”",The All India Football Federation has introduced a merit table for referees. ‘Key Match Incidents’ being measured by independent assessors at the end of every round in the Indian Super League and I-League.

NEW DELHI: Footballing legend Zlatan Ibrahimović once again gave a glimpse of his leadership qualities during a fiery post-match speech following AC Milan ’s stunning Italian Super Cup triumph over Inter has captivated fans worldwide.After retiring at the end of the 2022-23 season, Zlatan stepped into an advisory role at Milan, where his presence continues to inspire players on and off the pitch.""We have reached one of our aims. What we wanted was a reaction. This is our reaction, guys!"" Zlatan declared, addressing the team after their dramatic 3-2 victory over archrivals Inter on Monday.He commended head coach Sergio Conceicao and his staff, saying, ""Great work in just a few days."" Ibrahimović, ever the witty one in the dressing room, added with a wry smile: ""Luckily, he had a fever. If not, he would've broken more than a TV.""Zlatan also lauded the team’s hunger and sacrifices. ""You sweated to win this, made sacrifices, were hungry. When a team has a desire to win, it is hard to be beaten. You showed that today. At the start of the season, I said to you: it all depends on us, because it is all in your heads. You showed that today.""""Guys, this is AC Milan. We play for these trophies. If you want to go down in AC Milan's history, you need to win titles,"" urged Ibrahimović.Watch:The victory marked Milan's first Super Cup title since 2016 and their eighth overall.Under Conceicao’s leadership, Milan made a statement by staging dramatic comebacks in both the semifinals against Juventus and the final against Inter.Theo Hernandez , Christian Pulisic , and Tammy Abraham delivered crucial goals after being two down.Rafael Leão , pivotal in all three goals, orchestrated a free-kick, a clinical counterattack, and a perfect assist in stoppage time to seal the win.The team celebrated post-match, with Conceicao dancing and puffing a cigar in an iconic manner. Having taken over just a week ago, he’s already made a mark, guiding the Rossoneri to their first trophy since the 2022 Serie A win.Milan now return to Serie A action, emboldened by this victory, to face Cagliari.

Newcastle United took a big step towards the League Cup final with a 2-0 away win at Arsenal on Tuesday in the first leg of their semifinal.Alexander Isak and Anthony Gordon scored to secure the win for Newcastle, who have never won this competition, leaving Arsenal with a significant challenge in the return leg on February 5.The winners of this semifinal will face either Tottenham Hotspur or Liverpool for the title.Isak, currently England's most prolific striker, scored the opening goal and assisted Gordon for the second. In contrast, the absence of a clinical finisher hurt Arsenal despite the return of Kai Havertz, Martin Odegaard and Gabriel Martinelli to their starting lineupBoth the managers, Mikel Arteta and Eddie Howe, demonstrated their commitment to the competition by fielding their strongest available sides.Despite dominating possession and creating numerous opportunities, Arsenal struggled to convert their chances effectively. The closest Arsenal came was through Martinelli, who struck the woodwork after latching onto Leandro Trossard's delivery.Shortly afterwards, Arsenal, typically strong at set-pieces themselves, conceded when a long free-kick into their area found Isak, who finished decisively with a shot that went in via the crossbar.The Swede's 14th strike in his last 15 appearances elevated him to 50 goals for Newcastle, achieving this milestone quicker than club legend Alan Shearer.Isak played a crucial part in what could prove to be a match-defining second goal shortly after half-time. The Newcastle forward's skilful footwork enabled him to unleash a shot, which David Raya could only deflect towards Gordon, who promptly converted the rebound.Arsenal had opportunities to improve their prospects for the return fixture at Tyneside next month. Havertz inexplicably directed his header wide when presented with an open goal opportunity.Howe withdrew both Isak and Gordon as Newcastle adopted a defensive 5-5-0 setup for the final twenty minutes.",Alexander Isak and Anthony Gordon scored to secure the win for Newcastle.

Arne Slot on Tuesday emphasised that ongoing contract discussions involving key Liverpool players are not affecting team performance, following harsh critiques of Trent Alexander-Arnold 's showing against Manchester United Alexander-Arnold, who has been associated with a potential Real Madrid transfer, was responsible for Lisandro Martinez's goal in the 2-2 draw at Anfield on Sunday, during what was a below-par performance.The discussion about the right-back's future with the Premier League frontrunners continues as his contract situation remains unresolved.At 26, he is now eligible to negotiate with foreign clubs for a pre-contract agreement, as his current deal concludes this season.Reports indicate Real Madrid made an offer for the Liverpool academy graduate, which the club reportedly declined.Other significant players, including captain Virgil van Dijk and leading goalscorer Mohamed Salah , also have contracts expiring at season's end.Speaking ahead of Wednesday's League Cup semi-final first leg against Tottenham, Slot acknowledged Alexander-Arnold's performance against United was not up to his usual standard.""He's played so, so, so many games well for this club,"" he said. ""Now it wasn't his best, like for some others, it wasn't the best game.""And we just pick it up, start training today again, because these players know if you play 50, 60 games in the season that once in a while you don't have your best performance.""The Liverpool manager expressed dissatisfaction with how his players' performances are evaluated.""If we drop points, if Mo (Salah) misses the penalty against Madrid, he's distracted by his contract situation,"" said Slot.""If Trent has not his best performance, he's distracted by the contract situation.""If they play really well, nobody tells me, 'Yeah, that's because they have a contract situation'.""We always try to find arguments, but nine out of ten times the best argument is the quality of the teams you face, or the game plan the other team has.""Regarding Salah's enigmatic social media post on Monday featuring the three players with expiring contracts, Slot maintains direct communication with his squad.""I talk to my players so if there is anything that worries them, then they share this with me. That has not happened until now,"" he said.He concluded: ""I'm not focused on social media posts or what has been said about us, because if you do that as a Liverpool manager, you have no life, because this is one of the biggest clubs in the world and every second of the day people talk about us.""",Trent Alexander-Arnold has been linked with a move to Real Madrid.

Dani Olmo's Barcelona registration battle puts Laporta under pressure,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/top-stories/dani-olmos-barcelona-registration-battle-puts-laporta-under-pressure/articleshow/117025834.cms,"Dani Olmo. (Pic Credit - X)

The uncertainty surrounding Dani Olmo 's Barcelona career continues as the club engages in legal proceedings to reinstate the midfielder's registration.Barcelona's inability to comply with La Liga's financial regulations has left both Olmo and Pau Victor ineligible for the remainder of the season. This situation affects Olmo, who played a vital role in Spain's Euro 2024 triumph and is crucial to Barcelona's trophy aspirations.The club is appealing to Spain's top sports court (CSD), whilst club president Joan Laporta faces criticism from opposition factions over the situation.The initial registration of Olmo and Victor occurred temporarily following Andreas Christensen's injury.After losing two court cases, Barcelona sold VIP boxes at their under-construction Spotify Camp Nou for approximately 100 million euros ($104 million) to meet La Liga's financial fair play requirements, but missed the submission deadline by three days.Despite Barcelona now meeting financial criteria, La Liga regulations prevent players from re-registering with the same club within one season. Barcelona intends to challenge this rule's relevance.Reports indicate both players are displeased, having received assurances about their registration status. Coach Hansi Flick expressed dissatisfaction, while Ronald Araujo acknowledged the situation's negative impact.Olmo, who transferred from RB Leipzig, reportedly has a release clause allowing a free departure. However, neither player seeks permanent departure, potentially leading to a season-long absence if Barcelona's appeal fails.The situation mirrors the 2015 case of Arda Turan and Aleix Vidal, who couldn't play for six months due to Barcelona's registration ban. Under current circumstances, neither Olmo nor Victor could secure loans without complex contractual arrangements.Laporta faces mounting pressure, with opposition groups demanding his resignation. His presidency, set until 2026, faces scrutiny from ten groups, including Victor Font's faction.This crisis adds to Laporta's controversial tenure, which began in March 2021 amidst financial difficulties and includes the departure of Lionel Messi and criticism over the club's financial decisions.","Barcelona's inability to comply with La Liga's financial regulations has left both Olmo and Pau Victor ineligible for the remainder of the season.

Poor defending kills East Bengal’s comeback hopes as Mumbai seal it 3-2,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/indian-super-league/top-stories/poor-defending-kills-east-bengals-comeback-hopes-as-mumbai-seal-it-3-2/articleshow/117011517.cms,"Image credit: ISL

KOLKATA: In the end, East Bengal FC ’s promise for another gripping fightback at the Salt Lake Stadium vanished with a piece of dreadful defending.Riding their usually impressive wing-play, Mumbai City FC left the home team all over the place on Monday and went into the break with a handsome 2-0 lead thanks to goals from Lallianzuala Chhangte (39) and Nikolaos Karelis (44). East Bengal’s defensive set-up was at fault on both occasions.However, Oscar Bruzon’s hosts came back in the second half with renewed resolve and an own goal by Sahil Panwar (66) and substitute David Hmar’s deft left-footed finish in the 82nd minute not only turned the game on its head at 2-2 but kept East Bengal on track of producing a captivating comeback. Bruzon’s players had been there and done that here three weeks ago. But unlike the way they stunned Punjab FC 4-2 after trailing 0-2 at the end of the first half, Bruzon’s side imploded themselves in a terrible manner this time around.As Nathan Rodrigues delivered an ambitious through ball, it escaped Anwar Ali’s stretched leg near the halfline. Yet, Hijazi Maher was there to deal with the threat, but East Bengal’s Jordanian defender made a mess of his interception, allowing Karelis to do the simple job of beating goalkeeper Prabhsukhan Gill from close and establishing their domination on the red-and-gold in the ISL .The win helped Petr Kratky’s Mumbai move up to fifth on the standings with 23 points from 14 matches, while East Bengal’s hopes for getting closer to playoffs suffered another jolt, lying 11th with 14 points.After ending the year with one of their worst defeats (0-3 at NorthEast United FC ), Kratky was looking for a response from his players, and Vikram Pratap Singh and Bipin Singh rose to the occasion in no time, tormenting the home team with some pacey and eye-catching moves down the wings. It was, however, Kratky’s use of Chhangte as the centre of his domestic attacking trident which came in handy.Bruzon’s move to adopt a high line also proved to be a failed ploy in negotiating Mumbai’s attacks. In the first instance, East Bengal defenders were found wanting in noticing Chhangte’s run from behind as Mumbai winger latched on to Brandon Fernandes’ pass and placed it past a hapless Gill.Another sloppy defending allowed Mumbai to go 2-0 up. This time, Yuste was unable to stop Karelis’ run and Gill didn’t come out of his line to close the gap with Mumbai’s No. 9. The East Bengal defender managed to block Karelis’ first shot but the Greek striker slotted the rebound in.Bruzon had to react and on came Nishu Kumar and Mahesh Naorem Singh in the second half.The hosts upped their ante and Mahesh came calling with his trademark run down the flank. His initial shot was blocked by Mumbai goalkeeper Rehenesh TP but Vishnu followed the rebound and cut it back from the other end. Panwar, trying to clear the ball, ended up pushing it in.East Bengal looked hungry for more, virtually throwing the kitchen sink. David, replacing Jeakson Singh, made it 2-2 with a brilliant finish.East Bengal fans were suddenly sensing another comeback in the making. But Maher’s atrocious defending eventually put such hopes to bed.",Mumbai City FC went into the break with a handsome 2-0 lead thanks to goals from Lallianzuala Chhangte (39) and Nikolaos Karelis (44) East Bengal’s defensive set-up was at fault on both occasions.

Star midfielder Luka Modric scored as Spanish giants Real Madrid thrashed Deportivo Minera 5-0 to storm their way to the pre-quarterfinals of the Copa del Rey on Monday.Spain 's 'five star' show came via goals from Federico Valverde, Eduardo Camavinga and Arda Guler in the first half. The fourth strikes came in the second half from Modric before Guler completed his brace to seal the scoreline.Madrid introduced strikers Kylian Mbappe and Vinicius Junior only in the second half, as manager Carlo Ancelotti rested them in view of the Spanish Super Cup commencing in Saudi Arabia later this week.The match's early momentum was established when Valverde struck a volley at the far post, followed by Camavinga's header after 13 minutes to extend the advantage.Endrick nearly secured a third goal for Los Blancos, followed by Guler's successful strike, which deflected in after he moved inwards from the right wing.Early in the second period, Brahim Diaz struck the woodwork before veteran Modric, aged 39, scored with an elegant curling shot.In the final moments, Guler converted smoothly after receiving a setup from Fran Garcia, completing an impressive performance by the Turkish midfielder.Barcelona and Atletico Madrid progressed to the subsequent round on Saturday, whilst Athletic Bilbao, the current champions, narrowly advanced via penalties against third-tier Logrones.","Real Madrid thrash Deportivo Minera 5-0 in Copa del Rey.

Excerpts:

Players want shorter seasons, play with the same ball through the year, faster/slower courts, is tennis in danger of being homogenized?

Would a Premier Tour then divide the sport?

Jannik Sinner and Iga Swiatek have failed drug tests in 2024, how would that affect the Aus Open?

Novak Djokovic is chasing a 25th major title at the Australian Open, what do you think has worked for him in Melbourne?

The Murray-Djokovic partnership?

Craig Tiley – CEO, Tennis Australia and Tournament Director, Australian Open – believes a Premier Tour would give the multi-tiered sport order and breathing space.The idea of a Premier Tour – based on a breakaway formula, that appears to cater to elite players - has been the talking point in tennis for the last couple of years.In an exclusive chat with TOI, ahead of the first Grand Slam of the year, Tiley also warned not to underestimate the 10-time champion 37-year-old Novak Djokovic The Grand Slams are of the view that having fans understand when a player starts their journey and where they go and ensuring there’s a really good off-season for the players, is important. The seven governing bodies in tennis (ITF, ATP, WTA and the four Grand Slam tournaments) are in ongoing conversations, how do you create a Premium Tour that consists of major events throughout the year. Many of them already exist, but how do you bind them together? Elevate the premium side with the Grand Slams and Masters events potentially, that creates a strong narrative. For example, from Jan to Oct, and then having a couple of months off for off-season. The challenge we have in tennis is that it’s hard for the fans to understand why a player is playing here, what it means to their worldranking or their race. It’s not as clear-cut as we would like it to be. There’s an opportunity for the sport to be more coordinated in the delivery of that product to the fans. It also depends on the number of players you’re going to count in the professional ecosystem, having a thousand (players) potentially could be too many, so that has to be looked at.It’s really important that you have a large ecosystem. It comes down to a few things and one of them is that players need to make more money, and more players need to make a bigger living. We’ve got to create an ecosystem that is commercially viable and strong.The drug related issues are for those that are involved in it and (those) authorities.I’ve been around him for a long time, have a great deal of respect for him and his journey, coming from a war-torn country. It’s a remarkable story. He’s very comfortable playing in Australia, the surface suits his game, he’s got a big fan base here, probably the biggest outside of his home country. Some athletes just click at some places, Rafa (Nadal) did that at Roland Garros, maybe Roger (Federer) did that in many places and also at Wimbledon. We should never underestimate the amount of preparation that goes into (his campaign) and the details he takes care of. I think if I’m an athlete playing against Novak I would lose before I’ve started, just watching his routine because it’s unbelievable. Wouldn’t be surprised if he gets to 25.A promoter’s dream — two (contemporary) Number Ones, one coaching the other. When I first heard about that, before it was announced, I thought it was fantastic for both of them. Andy loves the game so much he will never leave tennis. And Novak with his success, these guys are mates who played against each other. They’ve had great matches here at the Australian Open and I’m looking forward to seeing where Andy is going to help Novak. It’s going to be followed a lot.","Craig Tiley is CEO, Tennis Australia and Tournament Director, Australian Open.

Cameron Norrie avoided disqualification and apologised after his tossed racket accidentally hit a spectator during an ATP Tour tournament in Auckland on Tuesday.Britain's Norrie, who was born in Auckland, was down match point against Argentina's Facundo Diaz Acosta when he lightly tossed his racket into the air. The racket struck a woman in a court-side box, but she was not injured.The chair umpire issued Norrie a warning, and he subsequently lost the match 2-6, 3-6 in the first round of the tournament. Last year, he had reached the final in Auckland.“I wasn’t meaning to do that but it’s still not ideal to be doing that and I’ve never done something like that,"" Norrie said. (The spectator) ""was laughing and I just said ‘so sorry, I didn’t mean to do that.’ And she said ‘yeah, I’m completely OK.’""That was not a big deal. But as we saw with some other players, you can easily be defaulted if it catches them in the wrong spot or they’re not looking or something.""I was not meaning to do that and it is completely not me to do something like that. I apologized very quickly and I want to apologise in general. I’m not happy with how I behaved.”In related incidents, Novak Djokovic was disqualified from the 2020 US Open for accidentally hitting a linesperson with a ball.At the 2023 French Open, Miyu Kato and Aldila Sutjiadi were also defaulted from the women’s doubles after a ball hit by Kato struck a ball girl.Additionally, Australian player Marc Polmans was defaulted from the final round of qualifying at the Shanghai Masters in 2023 for hitting a ball into the face of the chair umpire.","Cameron Norrie apologises after his tossed racket accidentally hit a spectator during an ATP Tour tournament in Auckland on Tuesday.

Excerpts...

Will Sinner and Swiatek's positive tests take the sheen off the Australian Open?

Nick Kyrgios has had a go at Sinner and Swiatek on social media, even hoping to play Sinner...

Would you say Djokovic has a few more years left in tennis?

What motivates Djokovic?

How do you like Alcaraz's chances at Melbourne Park?

How does on-court coaching help someone as gifted as Carlos Alcaraz?

Who would you pick as the surprise factor?

What are Sinner's chances of defending his title?

With the transition from the Big Three era, how do you envision the future of men's tennis?

What is the future of doubles?

The 22-time Grand Slam doubles and mixed-doubles champion Todd Woodbridge dismissed the effect of Jannik Sinner and Iga Swiatek's positive tests on the Australian Open, starting on Sunday in Melbourne Park.The 53-year-old believes the cases were handled swiftly and will not weigh on the first major of the year. In an interview with select media, Woodbridge liked Carlos Alcaraz's chances while warning that Novak Djokovic is motivated to extend his lead at the top of the game.Definitely not! One of the great positives to come out of those cases is the fact that our sport is dealing with them properly. It means our testing is rigid, we have a 52-week policy that players must abide by. The next part is the process they went through.There was negativity about Simona Halep's process, how long it took, why it took so long and then our processes were fixed. So you've had two of the best players in the world that had an issue, they have both been able to prove what those issues were. And remember, you are innocent until proven guilty.They were able to show cause and effect and the process was fast. It has allowed everybody to get back to normal. That is important because they're not going to be the last. There will be other players that are going to trip over or some that may deliberately cheat. There are going to be issues, but I am pleased with the process.As a former athlete, I would never want to put more pressure on myself, that's probably putting more pressure on his own self to have to perform. If that ( Sinner vs Kyrgios ) were to play out, it would be interesting viewing.Nick has been out of the game for a long time (almost two years), which is going to be a difficult thing for him. I hope he hasn't set his expectations too high because it's going to take time to get back to the level that he was playing at before that.He's certainly one of the favourites for the Australian Open. He comes in as little more of an underdog (this year) because he didn't do the best at Grand Slams in 2024, but he was in the Wimbledon final, he won the Olympics, he is knocking on the door. He's fit and motivated. While you've got the motivation, you don't stop. There's at least another two years in Novak, particularly if he has a strong start to this season in Australia.The thing that motivates him is winning Grand Slam titles, it's about extending his lead. No one is ever going to catch him. What drives an athlete like him is having somebody push him and that was Andy Murray Roger Federer , Rafa (Nadal) they challenged him. Now Alcaraz and Sinner have come along and I think he's got a bit to prove to them, that I'm not willing to give it all up yet. That's his motivating factor right now.This is his best chance yet. He didn't get to Australia after winning his first major (US Open, 2022), was injured. Then last year, he didn't have his coach Juan Carlos Ferrero, and he looked tactically unsure and didn't play his best. This time, he has done a proper pre-season. Alcaraz is so dangerous. He's the most enjoyable player to watch since Federer. He has the flair and finesse of Roger, fitness and movement of Novak and then the Spanish determination that Rafa had. He is probably my pick for the Australian Open based on the time he's had to prep. It will be some feat if he was able to win the Australian Open and then have all four majors at such a young age.As he's getting older he's starting to accumulate his own experiences to know what to do at the right time. One of the joys of watching him is that he has so many options, that's why it's so important for him. I'm hoping it's going to be a long career as he learns how to discipline his play because sometimes he plays a lot of drop shots and it's fancy and he can let an opponent back into a match.As you get older, you get more disciplined, you understand how to get that done. That was what Roger started to do very well when he was at his absolute prime, would just demolish players with the right shots at the right time. Carlos is still really putting all that together, he's still got a lot to improve on.I'm waiting for Mirra Andreeva to step up. She has this incredible allcourt game that's modern. It resembles Martina Hingis at her best, but with that modern power.Very high. He is the best player in the world right now. He's the defending champion, but that for me is going to be the one thing he's going to have to learn to live with. He hasn't defended a Grand Slam title yet in his career, this is his first.Everyone was worried. Will the quality drop? And I seriously didn't think that the younger generation would be able to play well this quickly, but they have. Some of their plays are quite extraordinary.They are stronger, more physically trained through technology and data. All of that has made the next generation better. There's still room for this generation to add nuance to their game, add that feel, soft hands, volleys, playing in different parts of the court.It depends on how much the governing bodies continue to make it important. When you see it as an Olympic sport, it remains something everyone focuses upon. When you look at the Grand Slams, it's important, huge events where they need content on all courts, not just Centre Court. So, I don't see it ever leaving the game. And throw in the team competitions like Billie Jean King Cup, Davis Cup , United Cup, they become crucial. Let's be honest, not every player will end up like a Sinner or an Alcaraz or a Sabalenka.(Tune in to watch the Australian Open 2025 from January 12, 2025, 5:30 AM IST onwards live on Sony Sports Ten 1, 2 & 5 channels)",Todd Woodbridge says Jannik Sinner and Iga Swiatek's positive tests will not have an impact on the Australian Open. The 22-time Grand Slam doubles and mixed- doubles champion also likes Carlos Alcaraz's chances.

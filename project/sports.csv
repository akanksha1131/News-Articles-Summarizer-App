India lost the third T20I against England in Rajkot on Tuesday and the home team's skipper Suryakumar Yadav rued the fact that they let England off the hook despite having them on the ropes.England's lower order, shepherded by Liam Livingsone (43 off 24 balls), revived the visitors from a precarious 127 for 8 to reach 171 for 9, which proved to be the difference in the end, as India could only score 145 for 9 in their chase to lose by 26 runs.The win kept the five-match series alive, with England cutting India's lead to 2-1.Despite England notching up a competitive total, skipper Surya feels his team had the game in its hand but for Adil Rashid 's tight spell that put the lid on India's scoring rate.Rashid took just one wicket but gave away only 15 runs in his four overs.""I felt there would be a little dew later in the day. I feel we had the game in our hands when Hardik Pandya(40 off 35 balls)) and Axar Patel (15 off 16) were batting. Credit goes to Adil Rashid; he bowled really well. That's why he is a world-class bowler. He didn't allow us to rotate the strike,"" Suryakumar said at the post-match presentation.""I feel you always learn something from a T20 game...We've got to learn from the batting point of view. Got to go back to the drawing board and learn from our mistakes.""England commenced strongly as opener Ben Duckett played an attacking role during his 76-run partnership with captain Jos Buttler (24 off 22). However, the visitors' position deteriorated from 83/2 to 127/8.Buttler acknowledged the concern about losing quick wickets but praised the lower-order batters for increasing the total towards the end and commended the bowling unit for their crucial performance when needed.After Livingstone departed in the 18th over, Rashid (10*) and Mark Woold (10*) added 21 runs for the last wicket to take the total past the 170-run mark.""I think the wicket looked different, Duckett played well. We lost wickets in clumps; we were disappointed...Credit to Rashid and Wood, they had a crucial partnership. That was the difference in the end,"" said Buttler""The guys bowled really well, it was nice to show off their skills. Not about how fast they can bowl, but how well they can adapt to the wicket,"" he added. ""He (Rashid) is the most important player in our team; we are fortunate to have Rashid in the team. He has all the variations.""","India lose third T20I against England by 26 runs in Rajkot. England reach 171 for 9 from their 20 overs. India could only score 145 for 9 in their chase. England win keeps the five-match series alive, with India's lead at 2-1.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117663397,imgsize-35816,width-400,resizemode-4/117663397.jpg"

Details from Virat Kohli's training session with Delhi Ranji Team at Feroz Shah Kotla

NEW DELHI: Female Afghan cricketer Firooza Amiri declares that her team will ""represent millions of women in Afghanistan who are denied their rights"" as they reunite for an exhibition match in Australia on Thursday.The Afghanistan Women's XI is set to face a Cricket Without Borders XI at Melbourne's Junction Oval, bringing together 21 female players who previously held contracts with the Afghanistan Cricket Board (ACB) before the Taliban's return to power in August 2021.The women cricketers, prohibited from playing in Afghanistan, have settled in Canberra and Melbourne, participating in local club competitions since their departure.Team captain Nahida Sapan and Amiri expressed appreciation to Cricket Australia and the Australian government for supporting women's sports.Amiri, who escaped to Pakistan before reaching Australia following the Taliban takeover, highlighted the significance of the team's reunion after three years of displacement.Sapan emphasised the broader impact, stating that the match represents hope for Afghan women's education, sports, and future.

KAVERAPPA RETURNS

SQUAD:

BENGALURU: After a five-year hiatus, top-order batter KL Rahul will return to the Ranji Trophy . The Karnataka batter will feature in his team’s crucial last league engagement against table toppers Haryana at the M Chinnaswamy stadium here from January 30.Rahul was expected to play in Karnataka’s previous contest at the same venue against Punjab last week but missed the tie due to a niggle. The 32-year-old, who has played 30 Ranji Trophy matches including two triumphant finals, is expected to arrive in the city early on Tuesday and hit the ground running.“Rahul will join the team for a couple of practice sessions and has informed us about the same,” acknowledged J Abhiram, chairman of the senior selection committee.While it is confirmed that Rahul, who returned 276 runs in five matches, including two half-centuries in Australia, will play, it is unclear at what position he will play in the must-win contest.Also See: ICC Champions Trophy 2025 While he opened the innings in four of the five Tests in Australia, he has floated in the middle order in One-Day cricket. In his last One-Dayer against Sri Lanka in August 2024, he came at No. 5, a role he had also performed at the 50-over World Cup at home in 2023. According to sources, with the Champions Trophy looming, the Indian team think-tank will advise Rahul on the batting position and the Karnataka team management is happy to work around it.Irrespective of where Rahul bats, one among KV Aneesh and Abhinav Manohar – two players in good touch -- will have to sit out.Pacer Vidwath Kaverappa, who picked up a shin injury during the Duleep Trophy in September last year, will make his maiden appearance this season. Kaverappa, who was handed a fast-bowling contract by the BCCI last year, has been undergoing rehabilitation at the National Cricket Academy for the past few months and was recently cleared for competition.Also See: Champions Trophy Schedule 2025 Kaverappa’s return could mean that youngster Yashovardhan Parantap, who was impressive in the win against Punjab, could miss out.Rahul has been added in the squad as the 17th player, with Vidhyadhar Patil making way for Kaverappa.Mayank Agarwal (c), KL Rahul, Shreyas Gopal (vc), Devdutt Padikkal, KV Aneesh, R Smaran, KL Shrijith (wk), Abhinav Manohar, Hardik Raj, Prasidh Krishna, Vidwath Kaverappa, Vasuki Koushik, Abhilash Shetty, Yashovardhan Parantap, Nikin Jose, Sujay Sateri (wk), Mohsin Khan","KL Rahul will return to the Ranji Trophy after a five-year hiatus.

Rajkot: A major point of interest in the ongoing series has been Mohammed Shami ’s much-awaited return after being out of action since the 2023 ODI World Cup. Shami was expected to play right from the first match but his bowling has been restricted to just the warm-up sessions.India’s newly-appointed batting coach Sitanshu Kotak , while clarifying that Shami was “fit,” hinted that India are planning to unleash Shami closer to the ICC Champions Trophy next month. When to play him will be a decision that rests with India’s head coach Gautam Gambhir and captain Suryakumar Yadav , Kotak said.“Yes, Shami is fit but something about him playing or not playing, I am not the one who can answer. There is definitely a plan (for Shami) looking at coming matches as well as One-Dayers. So, that is something Gautam and obviously Surya will take a call on. But (his) fitness, definitely is not a problem, depending on how they are planning to build his load,” Kotak said.A critical part of Kotak’s role will, of course, be beyond this T20I series , with Test and ODI skipper Rohit Sharma and star batter Virat Kohli going through a rough patch. Asked if he had identified areas where he could help them rectify, Kotak said, “Rohit and Virat are senior players, but even the players we have now, it is a lot about understanding how they are planning their games, how they think and then see if we can add something. If I can add value to 2%, 5% (of their game), that would be great.There might be a lot of things that I can also learn from them,” he said.",Mohammed Shami has been out of action since the 2023 ODI World Cup.

'Keep it Simple': Rubin Hermann on Paarl Royals’ approach in SA20

Paarl Royals , led by David Miller and featuring India's Dinesh Karthik , made history on Monday by becoming the first SA20 team to achieve a perfect home record at Boland Park .In a thrilling encounter, Dayyan Galiem and Mitchell van Buuren held their nerves to secure the win for the Royals, with six runs needed off the final over.This marks the first time an SA20 side has remained unbeaten at home throughout the league phase, surpassing Joburg Super Kings' previous best of four wins and one washout at the Wanderers in the 2023 edition.The loss eliminated Keshav Maharaj's Durban Super Giants from playoff contention, as they have only managed one win from nine matches.""Five from five at home, been fantastic support from fans. The local fans really do get behind us. Nice achievement, the guys have been phenomenal, sticking to their plans. So good to see the youngsters coming through,"" Miller said at the post-match presentation.South Africa's young talents, Luhan-dre Pretorius and Kwena Maphaka , played crucial roles in the Royals' continued dominance at the top of the SA20 points table.Maphaka delivered his best SA20 performance to date, with figures of 2/22, helping restrict the Super Giants to 143/7.Pretorius then clubbed 43 off 29 deliveries (5x4s, 1x6) in the successful run-chase, reclaiming the top run-scorer position from teammate Joe Root, who was dismissed LBW off the first delivery of the innings.The Royals had already qualified for the knockouts with seven wins from eight matches, with their only loss coming against MI Cape Town.

comeback after 12 years

Business as usual at nets

NEW DELHI: It's been 12 years and three months since Virat Kohli last played a Ranji Trophy match for Delhi. Since that frenzied game against Uttar Pradesh at a small, packed stadium in Ghaziabad - in a match lit up by the presence of established stars like Virender Sehwag , Gautam Gambhir, Ashish Nehra Suresh Raina and Praveen Kumar - Indian cricket has gone through many cycles of change.Kohli has been at the centre of it all, amassing 8500 Test runs in that period and becoming a brand ambassador for India's cricket. Now, with the dwindling form of the senior batters in focus after the Border-Gavaskar Trophy in Australia - and calls for more star presence in the Ranji Trophy growing louder - Kohli returned to the Ferozeshah Kotla on Tuesday for a practice session, two days ahead of Delhi's last Ranji Trophy match against Railways.Poor returns from the bat of late have haunted the likes of Kohli and other Test batters, forcing them to make the right noises by showing commitment to domestic cricket. However, it's easy to forget that Kohli has been playing rigorous, non-stop international cricket across formats for these 12 years.Kohli's presence ensured that the entire day's training became an event in itself. Delhi and District Cricket Association ( DDCA ) officials, working overtime to provide seamless practice in presence of a sizeable media, were eager to show off their proximity to the star. Phrases like ""he hasn't changed at all"" prefixed every conversation with anyone who spent even a minute with Kohli.Everyone wanted a piece of Kohli. From the Delhi team lining up like a human chain to greet him upon arrival to old acquaintances sharing a few laughs to a few extra 'security' people escorting him from the nets, it was like Kohli had not been to the Kotla at all these last few years. Of course, he's played numerous internationals and IPL games at this venue in the meantime.None of these 'special' arrangements were required earlier, but Tuesday morning was more about making a statement. So much so, that the members of Delhi team management were not shy of conceding that the team went through one of the most disciplined and intense warm-up drills in the season just to match Kohli's intensity. Too bad that it came when Delhi's domestic campaign is as good as over.When Kohli padded up in the nets, he was all business. He started by taking out two new bats from his kit bag. ""Bhaiya, aap knocking kar lo (you do the knocking),"" Delhi's designated captain Ayush Badoni said, ready to give up his own session. ""I'll stand behind you. We can switch and take throwdowns,"" was Kohli's response.Through the next 45 minutes, Kohli's batting drills revolved around playing off the backfoot and driving on the off-side. Driving through covers has been his bane of late. It was evident he was working overtime to find a solution to the problem.The punches off the backfoot to marginally back-of-a-length balls dominated the session. Balls outside off were met under the eye and steered square on the off side. Dabs and pushes towards cover point and third man were also a feature.The big lunges towards the full ball seemed a lot measured. It could be Kohli is getting into One-Day mode with the ICC Champions Trophy about three weeks away.As he walked off the nets, he told the team manager that he loved the practice and is eager to come back on Wednesday.As the nets session got over, Kohli's teammate from U-16 and U-19 days, Shawej Khan, walked up to him with his eight-year-old son Kabir. Kabir, an aspiring cricketer, brought a sketch of Kohli drawn by himself, and wanted to get it signed. As the media hounded the kid, he gave away Kohli's message to him: ""Your father shouldn't be telling you that you need to go for training. It should be you telling him that you want to train.""Before the entire team went into the Virat Kohli pavilion for lunch, Kohli got them into a huddle and delivered an animated speech. This isn't a sight usually seen in Delhi cricket . No one's going to give out the exact words but a few who couldn't resist would mention the crux of the speech. It was about stirring up the team, which has been floundering for the past few seasons.",Virat Kohli last played a Ranji Trophy match for Delhi 12 years and three months ago.

Stuart Broad on India's challenge in the Champions Trophy

NEW DELHI: When New Zealand quick Trent Boult was posed with a unique challenge -- how he would bowl the first over to the legendary Sachin Tendulkar ? -- he offered an entertaining glimpse into his hypothetical strategy.“All right,” Boult began, his voice tinged with playful confidence, “a very easy, very simple plan.”His imaginative field setup kicked off with one slip instead of two—recognising Tendulkar's formidable presence at the crease—and then a cover, a point, a mid-wicket, and a mid-off.Boult declared an audacious approach to unsettle the Little Master.Watch:He envisioned deceiving Tendulkar into thinking an in-swinger was coming, aimed at middle stump, luring him into a subtle push that would result in a mid-wicket catch.Boult elaborated, ""I'd even bring my cover fielder in close, making it look like a trap."" But his ultimate move? The bait-and-switch.“I’d run in, start my delivery, then change the plan completely,” he chuckled.In this imagined face-off, Boult would bowl a surprise bouncer, targeting Tendulkar’s helmet. He saw Tendulkar attempting a hook shot and being caught by the leg-side fielder.“First ball of the game—so easy,” he finished with mock bravado, knowing that such a feat is a bowler's fantasy against someone of Tendulkar's caliber.Meanwhile, Boult has been showcasing his real skills in SA20 2025, representing MI Cape Town.Despite his moderate tally of five wickets in seven matches, his team has claimed four wins, accumulating 21 points.MI Cape Town sit second, seven points behind the David Miller-led Paarl Royals, who top the standings.","Trent Boult imagines how he would bowl the first over to Sachin Tendulkar.

Former Manchester United midfielder Paul Scholes has delivered a scathing critique of Marcus Rashford , claiming the out-of-favour forward has ""let his teammates down"" and should be ""banished"" from the dressing room.Rashford, who has not played for United since December 12, has been repeatedly excluded from manager Ruben Amorim ’s squad, apart from one game where he remained an unused substitute.On Sunday, Amorim made a pointed remark about Rashford’s lack of effort, saying he would prefer to include 63-year-old goalkeeping coach Jorge Vital in the squad over the 27-year-old forward.Speaking on The Overlap Fan Debate, Scholes pulled no punches in his assessment of Rashford’s attitude. ""I think Marcus has let a lot of people down really, with his attitude, and I think that's what the manager is trying to say,"" said the United legend, who won 11 Premier League titles during his illustrious career.Scholes emphasized the influence Rashford should have on younger players, such as Alejandro Garnacho, given his experience and age. ""He's 27 years of age, and he's clearly not training properly. Young players are looking up to him, and he’s setting the wrong example.""Drawing from his own experiences, Scholes shared a moment when former manager Sir Alex Ferguson admonished him for letting down his teammates, likening that situation to Rashford’s current predicament.""Marcus is doing exactly the same. He’s not outright refusing to play, but his behavior and lack of effort in training essentially say, 'I don’t want to be involved.'""Scholes concluded with a harsh verdict: ""The fact he’s letting his teammates down in that dressing room means he should be banished. If young players see this as an example, the sooner he’s gone, the better.""Scholes’ criticism follows similarly strong remarks from former United defender Rio Ferdinand. Speaking on his Rio Ferdinand Presents podcast, Ferdinand said there was ""no way back"" for Rashford following Amorim’s damning comments.The England forward, who stated in December he was ready for a ""new challenge"" after being omitted from the squad to face Manchester City, has been linked with potential moves to Barcelona, Borussia Dortmund, and AC Milan. However, his reported £300,000-a-week ($374,000) salary, on a contract running until 2028, presents a significant obstacle to any January transfer.Rashford has been a key player for United in the past, scoring 138 goals in 426 appearances for the club. But with his current situation at odds with the team’s expectations, his long-term future at Old Trafford looks increasingly uncertain.","Paul Scholes says Marcus Rashford should be ""banished"" from the Manchester United dressing room.

(Bayern Munich Photo)

Bayern Munich has made a significant move for the future by signing 21-year-old goalkeeper Jonas Urbig from Cologne . The Bavarian club announced the transfer late Monday, confirming a deal that had been anticipated for some time.Urbig is regarded as one of Germany's most promising young goalkeepers, and his arrival at Bayern signals the club's intent to groom him as a potential successor to Manuel Neuer . At 38, Neuer remains Bayern’s first-choice goalkeeper but is nearing the twilight of his illustrious career.“We’re delighted to secure another signing with an eye on the future,” said Bayern’s sporting director Christoph Freund. He also referenced last week’s acquisition of German youth international Tom Bischof , emphasizing the club’s focus on young talent.Freund praised Urbig as “a modern goalkeeper” who aligns with Bayern’s style of play. He highlighted Urbig’s ambition, potential, and ability to emulate Neuer’s aggressive approach, often venturing out of goal to intercept threats and contribute to the team’s buildup play. This proactive style has been a hallmark of Neuer’s game, allowing Bayern to maintain high defensive lines while applying pressure on opponents.Bayern reportedly paid up to €10 million, including bonuses, to Cologne for Urbig, according to Kicker magazine. The young goalkeeper is expected to compete with Sven Ulreich , 36, and injured Israeli shot-stopper Daniel Peretz for the No. 2 spot behind Neuer. Meanwhile, Alexander Nübel , currently on loan at Stuttgart, remains another potential option for Bayern’s goalkeeping future. Nübel extended his Bayern contract until 2029, and his loan at Stuttgart likely ensures his continued presence in their lineup next season under coach Sebastian Hoeness.Urbig, under contract with Bayern until June 2029, is also in contention to represent Germany at the Under-21 European Championship in June, competing with Freiburg’s Noah Atubolu for the starting role. Earlier this season, Urbig began as Cologne’s starting goalkeeper in the second division but lost his spot to Marvin Schwäbe after 10 games.Speaking to Bayern’s website, Urbig expressed his excitement about joining the club. “I’m proud to be here and look forward to getting to know my new team as quickly as possible. My goal is to improve every day and continue my development within our goalkeeping group alongside Manuel Neuer,” he said.",Bayern Munich has signed goalkeeper Jonas Urbig from Cologne.

Former Manchester United defender Rio Ferdinand believes that Marcus Rashford's future at the club is uncertain following comments made by manager Ruben Amorim .Amorim stated that he would rather have his goalkeeping coach, Jorge Vital, in his matchday squad than Rashford.Rashford has not played for United since December 12, with Amorim leaving him out of the squad for every game since, apart from one in which he was an unused substitute.When asked about Rashford's absence from the squad for Sunday's 1-0 win at Fulham , Amorim made a pointed reference to the player's effort in training.""The reason is the training, what I think a footballer should do in training, in life and every day... I will put (in) Vital before I put (in) a player who doesn't give the maximum every day,"" said Amorim.Ferdinand, who had a successful 12-year career at Old Trafford, said he would be embarrassed by such a statement.""If I was that player that the manager said that about... embarrassment,"" he said on the Rio Ferdinand Presents podcast.""We all have days off or moments when we're not performing well, lacking confidence, but effort isn't really one of the things I would want to be hearing a manager say is lacking in my makeup.""That's a damning comment, because I think he knows what the reaction is after that comment. He's not saying that without thinking, 'Where does this go after?' There's really no way back for Marcus after that, I don't think, with that type of comment.""Ferdinand believes that there is ""really no way back for Marcus"" after Amorim's comment, despite acknowledging that everyone has off days or moments of lacking confidence.Rashford expressed his desire for a new challenge in December, but he is currently in limbo with one week remaining in the January transfer window.Several European clubs, such as Barcelona, Borussia Dortmund and AC Milan, have shown interest in the 27-year-old, who has scored 138 goals in 426 appearances for United.However, any potential move is complicated by Rashford's reported £300,000-a-week salary on a contract that runs until 2028.","Manchester United manager Ruben Amorim said he would rather have his goalkeeping coach, Jorge Vital, in his matchday squad than Marcus Rashford.

Barcelona scored their first four goals in 24 minutes and ended up hammering seven past a struggling Valencia for a commanding 7-1 victory on Sunday to give a much-needed impetus to their La Liga campaign.At the break, Barcelona were sitting at a handsome 5-0 lead. Fermin Lopez netted twice in the first half, while Frenkie de Jong, Ferran Torres and Raphinha also scored.The result marked Barcelona's second victory in last nine league fixtures. Hansi Flick's team now sits seven points behind La Liga leaders Real Madrid and three points adrift of second-placed Atletico Madrid.In the second half of the match, Hugo Duro managed to score for Valencia, before Robert Lewandowski added to Barcelona's tally, followed by a Cesar Tarrega own goal.Flick altered his team selection against Valencia, seeking to address the club's recent disappointing domestic results.The manager opted to rest Lewandowski and Ronald Araujo from the starting line-up and Pedri was unavailable due to stomach issues, allowing De Jong, Ferran Torres and the impressive Lopez to start.The comprehensive victory was a fair reflection of Barcelona's dominance, while dealing a significant blow to Carlos Corberan's Valencia, who remain in the 19th position, four points adrift of safety.Meanwhile, fourth-placed Athletic Bilbao failed to capitalise at home, managing only a goalless draw against Leganes, leaving them two points behind Barcelona.In other matches, Getafe boosted their survival hopes with a convincing 3-0 victory at Real Sociedad, moving up to 14th position, whilst Rayo Vallecano mounted a comeback to defeat Girona 2-1.","Barcelona thrashed Valencia 7-1 in La Liga on Sunday.

McManaman on Thomas Tuchel as the new England coach

MUMBAI: Things could hardly be going any better for Liverpool at the moment, be it domestically or in Europe. The Reds sit proudly atop the standings of both, the Premier League as well as the Uefa Champions League. In the latter, they are the only team in the revamped 36-club competition to have won each of their seven games so far.It’s the kind of position not many might have expected Liverpool to be in considering the arrival of a new manager in Arne Slot last summer following the end of a successful era under Juergen Klopp. “An incredible six months”, was how former Liverpool star Steve McManaman would describe it, though, he would also strike a cautious note saying it’s “the last four months” which would ultimately count.“I think the new manager and the coaching staff have been amazing, and the players as well,” McManaman, who is in India on an invitation from Standard Chartered for the SC Cup corporate football tournament, told The Times of India here on Saturday. “I didn’t think it’d be a huge transition because the team last year were very good. Of course, Juergen leaving was a blow at the time, but the new manager has come in and the team have responded really well.”The 52-year-old former England international put the exceptional start down to the solid foundations built during the Klopp era, which, he said, have helped Slot’s cause, as well as players getting better with experience, citing the examples of Ryan Gravenberch, Dominik Szoboszlai and Alexis Mac Allister. “The younger players have got more experience, so they’ve become better players. So all in all, I think they’ve all responded really well to the season, but I didn’t think that they’d be top of the league by six points with a game in hand and win seven from seven in the Champions League. So they’ve surprised me in that respect,” McManaman said.“When Juergen left, I think the foundations within Liverpool were exceptional, and Arne Slott has picked it up. We haven’t won any trophies yet this year, so it’s important not to go crazy. At this moment in time, he’s had an incredible six months, but the last four months are the most important months, starting with the League Cup second leg in a couple of weeks time against Tottenham (Liverpool lost the away leg 1-0).”But could the uncertainty surrounding the futures of key players like Mohamed Salah , Trent Alexander-Arnold and Virgil van Dijk be a stumbling block in the path of a team, who, according to McManaman, have the depth to “conceivably do the quadruple”?“The Mo Salah situation, Trent, Virgil van Dijk doesn’t bother me in the least. It won’t distract them. As a professional footballer, you want to be successful,” McManaman, a former Champions League winning midfielder with Real Madrid, said, adding: “In 2021, we had Mo Salah, (Roberto) Firmino and Sadio Mane in the same situation and they were going for the quadruple that year as well. So, no, I don’t think the contract situation is an issue at all.“I think Mo Salah wants to win every single trophy he can, including the Ballon d’or, including the leading goalscorer, the Golden Boot. So he won’t be thinking about his contract situation. That’s just secondary.”As well as it’s going at Anfield, it’s a different picture playing out at the Etihad, where defending champions Manchester City, the club which marked the final stop in McManaman’s playing career, are attempting to salvage their season after experiencing a shocking slump.While some pundits believe the long-term ACL injury suffered by Ballon d’Or winner Rodri has laid bare City’s lack of midfield recruitment in recent transfer windows, McManaman said the negative run could not be explained by the Spaniard’s absence alone.“I think it's a number of things. You can't lose games just because you lose one football player. I think Kevin de Bruyne was out at the same time, which didn't help. They had a number of issues defensively, which didn't help. And when I spoke about Liverpool getting a year more experience, the young kids getting a year older, maybe the Manchester City players are just getting older, that's all!“They've set such a high benchmark over the last four years, five years, that any decline is jumped upon. I still think they'll qualify for the Champions League (playoffs). They need to beat Club Brugge (on Wednesday). If they do that, they'll qualify and then you'll see probably a different Manchester City team. But, yeah, it's only because their standards have been incredibly high that any dip is pounced upon by the media,” said McManaman.“I personally would prefer an English manager to manage England. I know the FA did not speak to Eddie Howe. I know they didn't speak to Graham Potter. I know they didn't speak to a number of English players which was surprising. They thought Thomas Tuchel was the best man for the job, so fair enough, and I hope he wins the World Cup, I hope he's successful. But the fact that he's only got an 18-month contract suggests that after the World cup he might leave if he doesn't win the World Cup. So I don't know what the ins and outs is, but my personal preference would have been an English manager to represent the English national team.”",Steve McManaman says Liverpool have had an 'incredible six months' The former England international is in India for the SC Cup corporate football tournament.

NEW DELHI: India's top-ranked singles player Sumit Nagal has dropped out of the ATP top-100 rankings after a prolonged stint of 10 consecutive months.This setback comes on the heels of a string of underwhelming performances.Simultaneously, veteran doubles specialist Rohan Bopanna has slipped out of the top-20 rankings due to an early exit from the Australian Open, where he was defending a substantial number of points.Nagal had maintained his top-100 ranking since March 2024, initially breaking into the elite bracket in February of the same year on the back of a commendable showing at the season's first Grand Slam event.However, his recent struggles on the demanding Tour have been evident, with only three main draw victories across 18 tournaments since Wimbledon 2024.A top-100 ranking is highly coveted as it guarantees direct entries into major events, including Grand Slams, where even early-round exits can yield decent prize money.Sasikumar Mukund, Ramkumar Ramanathan, Karan Singh, and Aryan Shah are the other Indian singles players in the top-600 rankings.In the doubles realm, the 44-year-old Bopanna, still playing at a high level, has dropped five places to No. 21.As the defending champion at the Australian Open, he had to defend a significant number of points, but an opening-round exit with his new partner, Nicolas Barrientos, proved costly.Yuki Bhambri, N Sriram Balaji, Rithvik Choudary Bollipalli, and Arjun Kadhe are the other Indian doubles players in the top-100 rankings.Notably, Mukund, Ramkumar, Balaji, Karan Singh, and Bollipalli are part of the Indian Davis Cup squad set to face Togo in the World Group I Play-off tie on February 1-2, while Nagal and Bhambri have opted out of the match.",India's top-ranked singles player Sumit Nagal has dropped out of the ATP top-100 rankings.

NEW DELHI: Current world number one and reigning Australian Open champion Jannik Sinner has announced his withdrawal from the upcoming ATP 500 tournament in Rotterdam.The 23-year-old Italian, who recently secured his third Grand Slam title by defeating Alexander Zverev in the Australian Open final, has cited the need for rest and recovery as the primary reason for his decision.In a statement released by the tournament organizers, Sinner acknowledged the difficulty of the decision but emphasised the importance of allowing his body to recuperate after the gruelling campaign in Australia.""After consulting with my team we had to take the difficult decision to withdraw from the ABN AMRO Open,"" Sinner said. ""My body needs time to rest after the long run in Australia.""Sinner, who won the Rotterdam title last year, expressed his fondness for the tournament and the enthusiastic crowds, stating, ""My body needs time to rest after the long run in Australia.

There’s an opaqueness to Jannik Sinner on a tennis court, the tighter a match gets the more inscrutable his expression becomes. Then, as the contest peaks and he is pulled out wide, he threads the needle with a two-hander. Sinner clutches his racket at the throat and shakes it, as if he’s in a conversation with his coaches Darren Cahill and Simone Vagnozzi, who are seated in his courtside box.The 23-year-old World No.1, who scored a straight-set win over the No.2 seed Alexander Zverev in the Australian Open final on Sunday, which made him the first Italian to lift three Grand Slam trophies, has been under a doping cloud these last nine months. Sinner, who won successive hard court majors in a span of four months while dealing with the upshot of positive drug tests, has flaunted serious heft.The World Anti-Doping Agency has appealed to the Court of Arbitration for Sport and a hearing is scheduled for April. The Italian faces a potential ban of up to two years.“Even when it's very difficult to block these kind of things, when I go on the court, I have the team and people who are close to me who trust me,” he said, sporting a striking Italian blue for his post-championship media conference. “That for me is even more important because I can talk with them, very openly.”“When I go on court, I try to focus on the match,” he said. “I know the match can be three, four, five hours, but that's the time when I have to be very focused. Obviously also in the gym, trying to stay with your routine, then you think a bit less about what's happening. Of course, it's still a little bit in the back of your mind.”Sinner and world No.3 Carlos Alcaraz, who have taken the baton from tennis’ terrific trio – Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal and the still-competing Novak Djokovic -- who between them have won the last five Grand Slams, and six of the last seven, said he doesn’t need to use the CAS case to give him extra motivation to succeed.“What happened, happened, no?” Sinner said. “As I always say, I keep playing like this because I have a clear mind on what happened. If I was guilty, I would not play like this, that's it. At the moment, I'm not thinking about this. Of course, you have your moments, certain days where you feel like I wish I would not have this problem. In the other way, I'm always looking forward to go on the court.”Sinner, whose first language is German and speaks passable Italian, is his country’s most popular sportsperson. Last year, when Sinner emerged as the surprise winner of the Melbourne Park fortnight, there were no Italian journalists present, there hadn’t been one for years. This year there was almost a dozen of them, tracking the No.1s moves.Gaia Piccardi, tennis writer for Corriere Della Sera, says Italians admire Sinner’s work ethic. “Italians love a good sporting story, especially one that’s going to go a few years,” she says, “they see Jannik as someone they can cheer on for another 10 years.’’Vagnozzi, who has been with Sinner since February 2022, spoke of the No.1’s mental prowess.“Mentally he is really, really strong. When he wants something, he tries to do the best he can. So sometimes when someone speak about Jannik, they talk about his groundstrokes or his power. But for me, as a coach, when you ask him (to do) something, he's able to do it quite fast.”Zverev, who said Sinner was miles ahead of everyone on hardcourts, compared the Italian to Djokovic at his best.“They barely miss, they make you think like you have to overhit all the time to have a chance in a rally against them,” the German said of Djokovic and Sinner. “It's very, very difficult to win a point from the back of the court against them. They're constantly on the baseline. They don't give you any space. They don't give you any time.”Sinner’s win over Zverev in the Australian Open final took his win streak in hardcourt majors to 21 matches. The Italian hasn’t lost a set against top-10 opposition since losing to Alcaraz in the Beijing final.“I think the facts speak for themselves,” Zverev said. “He's in a different universe right now to anyone else.”",World No.1 Jannik Sinner won the Australian Open on Sunday.

Alexander Zverev 's loss in the Australian Open final on Sunday was followed by a startling moment during the trophy ceremony.As Zverev stood at the microphone, a person in the stadium repeatedly shouted the names of two of his ex-girlfriends who have accused him of physical abuse in the past, saying ""Australia believes"" them.The crowd's reaction was mixed, with some booing and whistling in response to the interruption. At his post-match press conference, Zverev was asked about the incident.""I believe there are no more accusations,"" Zverev responded. ""There haven't been for — what? — nine months now. ... I think I've done everything I can, and I'm not about to open that subject again.""Last June, as Zverev reached the French Open final , news emerged that a Berlin district court had ended a trial stemming from a woman's accusation of domestic violence during a 2020 argument. The resolution was reached with the agreement of state prosecutors and lawyers for Zverev and his former partner.Zverev had previously denied another assault allegation made by a different woman. The ATP investigated her claims and stated in January 2023 that there was insufficient evidence.","Alexander Zverev lost to Novak Djokovic in the Australian Open final.

Jannik Sinner threw in a daring drop shot at match point, it came off his forehand side and was shaped with underspin. Alexander Zverev picked it up and didn't place it too poorly, but Sinner stepped in and swung through the court to close out the Australian Open final.After two-hours and 42-minutes of action in which time he strung together the 6-3, 7-6 (4), 6-3 win, Sinner, the world No.1, pushed his head back and threw up his arms in celebration. After the few seconds he had to himself, Rod Laver Arena on its feet, cheering him, Sinner looked at his team – coaches Darren Cahill and Simone Vagnozzi, trainer and physio Marco Panichi and Ulises Badio – before going over to embrace them.Not far from where Sinner celebrated his second successive win at Australian Open, Zverev, the world No.2, sat in his courtside seat, head bowed. The German has played three Slam finals and is looking for his first major title.Sinner and Zverev shared a warm embrace at the net and the 23-year-old began his speech with encouraging words for Zverev.""You are an amazing player,"" Sinner said. ""Keep believing in yourself, because all players and coaches know how strong you are, not only as a player, but also as a person. We all believe that you can lift one of these very, very soon.""Sinner, now a two-time Australian Open champion, and a three-time major winner, placed the Norman Brookes Challenge Cup beside him as he spoke, said, ""Talking about my team, what can I say? We worked a lot to be again in this position. It’s an amazing feeling to share this moment with all of you. It is amazing to achieve these things, but mostly to share this with you guys.""""And I know Darren, it's probably your - maybe, I try to convince you to stay - your last Australian Open as a coach, and I'm very, very happy to share this trophy with you,"" Sinner told Cahill, who was tearing up. ""Everything started a little bit when I made my whole change to Simone (Vagnozzi), and I think you are an amazing combination of coaches.""Earlier, when the German stepped forward to make his speech, there was a shout from the crowd, ""Australia Believes Olya and Brenda! Australia Believes Olya and Brenda!""Zverev battled a domestic violence case in Germany last year, accused by his ex-girlfriend Brenda Patea, the mother of his child, of physically abusing her. All of which he denies and wasn't formally charged.When asked about it in the press conference, Zverev said, ""I believe there are no more accusations. There haven't been for nine months now. Good for her. I think she was the only one in the stadium who believed anything in that moment. I think I've done everything I can, and I'm not about to open that subject again.""Zverev applauded the winner in his speech. ""You are the best player in the world by far. I was hoping that I could be more of a competitor today, but you were just too good. Congratulations to you. You really deserve it.""Sinner, who hasn't lost a set against top-ten opponents since losing to Carlos Alcaraz in Beijing in September, may not have played his best match in the final, but did enough to get through without facing a breakpoint.Sinner was kitted in colour blocks of the palest yellow and white, his attire cutting an anaemic look, while across the net Zverev was all colour, red on maroon with red shoes.In the first set, the 27-year-old, coming into the net, trying to unsettle the Italian, gave Sinner some target practice. The German trailed 15-40 in the fourth and eighth games, if the defending champion was sharpening his knife in the fourth game, he struck in the eighth and then went on to serve out the set at love in the ninth, closing with a 194 kmph ace.The roof over Rod Laver Arena was open and like the evening sky, that had lost some of its sparkle, Zverev, who looked to be in striking form as he advanced to the final at Melbourne Park , seemed to have lost some of the edge. The German did well to push the set to tie-break, where Sinner came through with a slice of luck on the ninth point, the net cord working for him, and the world No.1 broke away to seal a two-sets-to-love lead.In the third set, Sinner broke in the sixth game, as a dejected Zverev appeared to throw in the towel. The Italian was out in the front and didn't look back.","World No.1 Jannik Sinner beats Alexander Zverev in Australian Open final.

The Times of India in Melbourne:

Madison Keys walked into her post-championship media interaction in black tights and a blue tee, wearing her wholesome halo.The Australian Open champion took a sip of the celebratory bubbly and spoke eloquently about shifting goal posts, development tools, and the importance of therapy. ""I think everyone needs therapy,"" she said.Keys was all of 11 when she was first talked of as a future Grand Slam champion, at that point it was music to her ears. The American -- Rock Island, Illinois-born -- turned pro on her 14th birthday and made her WTA debut a few weeks later. Keys, already 5 ft 10 and clocking 115 mph serves, entered the Grand Slam field for the first time at Melbourne Park as an 18-year-old, the following year she stormed into her first major semifinal, at the Australian Open. In 2017, three years later, she made the US Open final.Keys, who dug deep in her media conference, said the talk around her as a child was meant to be confidence-building, an exercise in positivity.""Then you are older, you're in the later stages of your career and it kind of feels like, will this ever happen? If it doesn't happen, I didn't live up to what everyone told me I should have done,"" Keys said. ""It went from being something positive to something that (triggered) a little bit of panic. It started to kind of weigh on me. What if I never do it? If I don’t do it, am I considered a failure?""The American, who married her coach Bjorn Fratangelo , 31, acknowledged the load she was carrying was heavy.Keys, whose ranking slipped out of the top-20 late last year, was forced to look at herself in the mirror.""I finally got to the point where I was proud of myself and proud of my career, with or without a Grand Slam,"" she said, looking at the Daphne Akhurst Memorial Cup. ""I didn't need it to feel like I had a good career.""Shrugging off that weight allowed Keys to go all-out on the court and win a Grand Slam.Keys, who on Saturday became the oldest player to defeat the World No.1 and No.2 in the semifinal and final at a Grand Slam event since the WTA rankings were published in 1975, said she owed her turnaround to lots of therapy.Keys, soon to be 30, is the lowest-seeded player (No.19) to win the Australian Open in the Open Era.The American, who turns 30 in a few weeks, went the sports therapy route initially, looking to nail results. Then Keys started digging, she asked herself tough questions, what did she feel about herself?""Getting help and talking to someone not just about tennis, but about how I felt about myself, again, very uncomfortable. I never really like to be uncomfortable,"" Keys said, she was speaking for a majority. ""(But) had I not done that, I wouldn't be sitting here.""The trigger stirred when Keys had got to a point where she started to feel low and didn’t really care about tennis and results, she just wanted to feel better. She was aching to exhale.""For a long time I had this idea that people were able to ignore their nerves and just tunnel vision,"" she said. ""It was a light bulb moment (when I realized) I can be nervous and I can still play good tennis. Those things can live together. I stopped fighting, trying to push away the feelings and pretending that they're not there and just accepting them.""Keys pointed out that the stigma around therapy was starting to go away.""Everyone should be in therapy, no matter what,"" she said with a smile. ""No matter what's going on in your life, you're going to have moments where things are tough and you need someone to talk to. It's something I will continue to do for the rest of my life.""Keys, flaunting a normalcy that was enviable, might be the new standard in sport.",Madison Keys won the Australian Open on Saturday.

TimesofIndia.com in Melbourne:

Professional sport is decided by moments. By sudden change in momentum. By luck. By one wicket. By one boundary. By one jab. By one point. The margins between win and loss, joy and sorrow, could well be just that. Years and years of hard work could well be decided by these small facets. How you play that one delivery coming at you at 150 kmph. How well you land that 150 kmph in the first place. How, if at all, you duck that right hook. How you play that forehand when down match point. Or, conversely, play the big points – such as a match point – when you've got lots at stake. Madison Keys and Aryna Sabalenka had plenty at stake when they took court in front of tens of thousands of people at the Rod Laver Arena on Saturday. A $3.5 million prize cheque. 2000 ranking points. Opportunity to lift the Daphne Akhurst Memorial Cup. Accolades.Sabalenka had done these things before already, though. Twice (in 2023 and 2024). She was going for a three-peat at Melbourne Park. No one had won three in a row here since Martina Hingis in 1999. She had had a largely uneventful run to the title match. Except for the tricky second set, under stiff conditions, against Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova in the quarter-final, things had gone smoothly and as per plan.Keys, meanwhile, had ticked none of those boxes. Her last run to a major final was eight years ago – the longest gap between first two women's singles Grand Slam finals. She had not been in the top 10 for two years. And her run to the final was laden with high-profile wins – against World No. 10 Danielle Collins, World No. 6 Elena Rybakina, World No. 28 Elena Svitolina and World No. 2 Iga Swiatek . Against Swiatek, Keys was required to save a match point.On Saturday, Keys started and ended well. She broke Sabalenka in the very first game and to complete the full circle, did that once again in what was the eventual 38th game of the two-hour contest. In the moments that mattered, the miniscule bits in the grand scheme of things, Keys was braver and hit bigger shots against Sabalenka, considered one of the biggest and boldest hitters in women's tennis.In the seventh game of the decisive third set, Keys served at 30-30. The crowd was aware of the magnitude of the point as the intensity and decibel level went up. If it went Sabalenka's way, she would have a break point to create a match-changing lead. Instead, Keys served wide to the forehand and punched a winner on the return to the other side of the court. Next point, a mirror image of it with a backhand winner.Fast forward four games, it was 5-5 and 30-30, the sun had set over the Melbourne skyline and the twilight had made way for a clear and cool night. Keys bounced the ball to serve and the nerves, if any, were not quite visible for either player. They were dialled in, as you need to in professional sport from start to finish. One miscalculation, one mishit, any passivity and it could be curtains. Keys, though, was in the zone. She got down low to a deep return and diverted the ball into the corner for a winner. Next point, same direction for a similar outcome and she had pushed the envelope in Sabalenka's side.The Belarusian, who had started the match poorly, especially on serve, had regained control. But, as already mentioned, we were in small margins territory now. ""Squeaky bum time,"" as legendary Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson referred to it. Four points separated Keys from the title. Sabalenka started by sending her forehand long on a mishit. Make that three. On the second, Keys romped to a little kick serve for a backhand winner. Two more to get. Sabalenka erred on the forehand a point later and it was Championship point. The World No. 1 saved one. Could she prolong the edge-of-the-seat encounter, everyone wondered. Many neutrals in the Rod Laver Arena hoped. Instead, Keys went inside out on the forehand once and then again, the first one came back but the second one didn't. 'Maddy' had done it!Keys was the 2025 Australian Open champion. Her first-ever Grand Slam title, 16 years after turning pro. The 30-year-old became the fourth oldest first-time Grand Slam winner. When the rankings are updated on Monday, she would match her career-best World No. 7 ranking.The contrast in emotions was visible across the net. Keys erupted with smiles, joy, and sheer disbelief. She made her way to her team and exchanged hugs with everyone, including husband and coach Bjorn Fratangelo, whom she married only eight weeks ago.For Sabalenka, meanwhile, it was bewilderment – at the outcome, the tennis she displayed and most problematically, she acknowledged, with her humility of the situation. The racket bore the brunt of that. She bumbled to her box and coaches, with whom she shares a great relationship filled with laughter and banter, as she made her way to the net for the customary handshake – or hug in this case. The 27-year-old then smacked her racket on the ground and walked off to the locker room.""There definitely was a bit of frustration because I was so close to achieve [achieving] something crazy. When you're out there, you're fighting, but it seems like everything [was] going not the way you really want [it] to go. I just needed to throw those negative emotions at the end just so I could give a speech, not stand there being disrespectful. I was just trying to let it go and be a good person, be respectful,"" she said in the post-match media interaction with a laugh. ""I was stand [standing] there and just was like, ‘Okay, c'mon, you've been in her position. She deserves that. She was [a] better player than you.' Just, you know, it was tough,"" added Sabalenka.During the first set and start of the second, Sabalenka would look at her box repeatedly, mumble something, and continue. Things were not going her way and Keys deserved most of the credit for that. If the serve was faltering, it was because it had come under the pump from the word go. The American, who had won the Australian Open warm-up event in Adelaide, had come out quickly off the blocks and was sending deep groundstrokes to counter Sabalenka's game of dominating proceedings with her sheer power. The Belarusian, who has three major titles on hard courts, looked clueless.She later said, at this point in her career, it was ""trophy or nothing"".""Nobody remembers the finalist, you know? Nobody puts, like, next to the winner [the] finalist's name,"" she said with a smile. ""I mean, at this point, yeah, I go for titles. But, of course, I have to be proud of myself with the finals, three finals in the row. That's something crazy. I hope that next year I'll come back as a better player, and I'll hold Daphne one more time,"" she stated.",Madison Keys beat Aryna Sabalenka in straight sets to win Australian Open. The World No. 1 became the fourth Grand Slam winner of her career. Keys is the first woman to win the title in Melbourne since Martina Hingis in 1999.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117575700,imgsize-172866,width-400,resizemode-4/117575700.jpg"

in Melbourne:

Intent might be everything on Sunday night when the Rod Laver Arena rocks to the beat of gunshot serves and muzzle energy off the ground.The common consensus in tennis circles is that Alexander Zverev , the world No. 2, is a ‘beast’ physically and should the Australian Open men’s singles final go the distance, it augurs well for the German whose 5-set record stands tall at 23-13.Jannik Sinner , the world No. 1, who hasn’t lost a match since Oct, but has struggled physically in Melbourne, will want to finish it quickly. The defending champion has lost five of his last six 5-set matches (from Jan 2023).Zverev, 27, playing his third major final, and looking for his first Grand Slam title, showed intent after coming up short against the genius of Carlos Alcaraz last June in Roland Garros, falling in five sets in the final. Not long after, Zverev signed up fitness guru Jez Green, who he had worked with early in his career (2015 to 2021).“I always knew that I could last with anyone for as long as I wanted when I was with Jez Green. When I was with him for seven years, I felt like I was one of the strongest players on tour, physically,” the world No. 2 said. “That was the reason why I hired him, to be physically at the same level again. I said it after the French Open final that I got tired against Carlos, I simply got tired in the fourth and fifth sets.”Sinner, who trails Zverev 2-4 in head-to-head clashes, will look to corner his opponent and make the contest a mental exchange. “It’s going to be mental, no?” the 23-year-old defending champion said of the final. “It’s going to be a tough match for both of us. It’ll be physical, for sure.”Sinner who rallied from 0-2 sets down to beat Daniil Medvedev in last year’s final isn’t new to the long story. He has learnt well from the six losses in nine 5-set affairs.“I try to put a lot of work in the days off, trying to understand my body,” said Sinner, who overcame physical discomfort in the fourth round against Holger Rune and in the semifinals against Ben Shelton. “There’s a lot of things going on, on and off the court. I try to isolate myself a little bit, trying to be myself on the court. There are days where it’s easier, days where I struggle a bit more.”Sinner’s coach Darren Cahill, who applauded the work Zverev has put in over the years, extolled the German’s physical prowess. “Jannik is improving, he’s getting better physically. He’s somewhat of a late developer with the body. He is about 6-ft-4-in now,” he said. “He’s going to get better as time goes along.”Zverev, who has saved 27 of 35 (77%) of breakpoints in this year’s championships, is only a tad behind the Italian who has saved 18 of 23 (78%). “Playing at night maybe will favour Jannik a bit more,” Zverev said.","Alexander Zverev faces Jannik Sinner in the Australian Open men's singles final.

Jannik Sinner acknowledges the formidable athleticism of Alexander Zverev as he aims to achieve consecutive Australian Open victories, a feat accomplished by only a select few, in a final that showcases the two highest-ranked players globally.Darren Cahill, who coaches Sinner, acknowledged the significant challenge presented by Zverev's intense determination to secure his first Grand Slam title.""He's a physical beast,"" Cahill said. ""He's put those years of work into his body. He is a great athlete and has a great five-set record. They're both physically prepared, both incredible athletes.""""It's the number one and two in the world, so it's the perfect final as far as the rankings are concerned.""Composed world number one Sinner enters Sunday's final riding a 20-match winning streak, having conceded merely two sets throughout his six matches in the tournament.Sinner stands as the favourite to claim his third Grand Slam title and second Australian Open following his victory against Daniil Medvedev last year.Since 2000, only Andre Agassi, Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic have achieved successive victories at Rod Laver Arena.However, the 23-year-old, who experienced cramps during his semi-final against Ben Shelton, has inadvertently provided Zverev with a potential advantage ahead of their decisive encounter.""Every day is a big challenge. Every day you have a different opponent,"" said Sinner. ""Sometimes you have some issues and then try to understand whatever works best for that day and try to go for it. Everyone makes mistakes. Nobody's perfect.""Zverev's recent physical conditioning has yielded results, with an impressive record of 16 victories in 17 matches since his triumph at the Paris Masters in November.Although he maintains a favourable 4-2 head-to-head advantage against the Italian competitor, the 27-year-old Zverev is acutely aware of his struggles in crucial Grand Slam moments.His runner-up finishes at the 2020 US Open and the French Open last year remain his best Grand Slam performances.Following his setback at the French Open, he collaborated once again with the highly respected fitness coach Jez Green. His primary objective has been to achieve optimal physical conditioning, enabling him to compete effectively against top-tier opponents such as Sinner and Alcaraz.""I think I said it also after the French Open final, I got tired against Carlos. I simply got tired in the fourth and fifth set,"" he said.""Yes, there were some unlucky moments. In general, I got tired, and I didn't want that to happen this year anymore.""Look, I think Jannik has been the best player in the world for the past 12 months,"" he added. ""There's no doubt about it. Won two Grand Slams, has been very, very stable in those regards. I'm sure it's going to be a tough battle on Sunday.""","Jannik Sinner faces Alexander Zverev in Sunday's Australian Open final. World number one Sinner is on a 20-match winning streak.

NEW DELHI: Two-time Olympic medallist and one of India’s most celebrated badminton players, PV Sindhu has embarked on a new chapter in her career by teaming up with renowned Indonesian coach Irwansyah Adi Pratama .This partnership comes at a crucial time as Sindhu aims to regain her competitive edge and reclaim her status among the elite in women’s badminton.Previously, Sindhu has been coached by Pullela Gopichand , South Koreans Kim Ji-Hyun and Park Tae Sang, and Malaysia’s Muhammad Hafiz Hashim. Irwansyah, known for his success with Indonesian stars Jonatan Christie and Anthony Ginting, has been tasked with revitalizing Sindhu’s game.It has been a tough two years for Sindhu. After winning the 2022 Commonwealth Games title, she experienced a lull and didn’t win any tournament till her Syed Modi Super 300 crown in December last year.“Every player has been through something like this. What I’ve learned, I want to pass on to her. I’ll try my best. I believe she can still do it. She can come back and reach an even higher level than before. I do believe in it. That’s the reason I’m here,” Irwansyah said.“I want to help her enjoy herself more on the court. It’s important that she enjoys it because when she enjoys it, she’ll become more confident. That’s the main focus right now – working hard to get her to believe in herself again. After everything, the last two years have been tough -- injuries, maybe... It’s really about confidence. I’m doing my best to help her believe in what she has. She has a lot of potential,” the coach added.Irwansyah’s approach focuses on enhancing Sindhu’s natural aggressive playing style. “My plan is to make her a more attacking player. She has all the right qualities, so I just want to build on that and push her further. I want to change her game to be more aggressive -- more speed and power,” Irwansyah said.As Sindhu begins this new journey, she expresses a renewed sense of purpose and determination. “The bonding is important between coach and athlete. I’ve heard a lot about him, and I thought he is the right coach for me. The way he approaches opponents, I think it’s really good,” Sindhu said.At the India Open , Sindhu lost in the quarterfinals to Indonesia’s Gregoria Mariska Tungjung. Despite the loss, Sindhu gave a good account of herself, giving glimpses of her old self.“I need to maintain my speed. I need to have my power. The women’s singles game is evolving, and after playing for so many years, I think opponents definitely know my game by now. So, it’s crucial to strategize, having both Plan A and Plan B,” said Sindhu. “I still feel there’s so much more to achieve. I have that fire in me, and I know I can do it. It’s just a matter of time and rhythm.”","Two-time Olympic medallist PV Sindhu has teamed up with renowned Indonesian coach Irwansyah Adi Pratama.

Rohit Sharma on India XI vs Australia, impact of Varun Chakravarthy and Dubai pitches

Varun Chakaravarthy after dream Champions Trophy debut: 'Virat, Rohit, Hardik helped calm me down'

Champions Trophy: Varun Chakravarthy shocks New Zealand with spin magic

Familiar setting, familiar situation and India would hope it's an unfamiliar result when they take on Australia in the first semi-final of the ICC Champions Trophy in Dubai on Wednesday.The scars of 2015 ODI World Cup semi-final, 2023 ODI World Cup final will still be fresh for every Indian cricket fan but the Men in Blue have the opportunity to apply the ointment when they lock horns at the Dubai International Stadium.It hasn't been an ideal campaign for the Aussies as two of their games in Pakistan were rain-hit and they had to take the next available flight to Dubai for acclimitisation ahead of the knockouts. They haven't had enough game time before the clash against India but will still remain a formidable opposition which turns into a beast on big days. And no one would know that more than Rohit Sharma, who was part of both fixtures in 2015 and 2023.""It's a great opposition to play against. All we had to do is what we've been thinking about the last three games. And we have to approach that game in a similar fashion. We understand the opposition and how they play and stuff like that. But I think the more and more we focus on what we need to do as a group, as a player, as a batting unit, as a bowling unit, that helps us a lot. I said it, yes, but look, Australia have been such a great team over the years.""So, we will expect some fight backs. We will expect some nervy times as well in the middle. But that is how the game is being played these days. And you're talking about the semifinal. Obviously, the pressure will be on both teams to win that game. But I think it's important for us to just keep focusing on what we need to do, keep doing our things and keep doing those things right. And then the result will come if we keep doing the things that we are supposed to,"" says Rohit when he asked about the opposition ahead of the last-four clash.There is growing chatter on the unfair advantage for India as they are playing all their games at one venue, including the knockouts, but Rohit had a different take on the matter and asserted ""Dubai is not our home"". In his typical avatar, the Indian captain elaborated how the pitches behaved differently for all their group games and they are still not aware about the pitch for Tuesday.""No, look, the three matches we played, the nature of the surface was the same. But in all three games, the pitch has behaved differently. Today, we saw that when the bowlers were bowling, their ball was swinging a little. We didn't see that in the first two games when our bowlers were bowling. And in the evening, it's a little cold in the air. So, there are obviously a lot of chances of that swing. We know this. But in the three games we played, there are four or five surfaces that are being used. So, every surface has a different nature.""In the semi-final, we don't know which pitch is going to be played. Yes, we don't know which pitch is going to be played in the semi-final. But whatever happens, we have to adapt and see what is happening. We will play on that. This is not our home, this is Dubai. So, we don't play so many matches here. This is new for us too,"" explains Rohit.In the three matches, India have aced the conditions game to perfection and took it a notch higher when Varun Chakaravarthy replaced Harshit Rana in the playing XI for the game against New Zealand on Sunday. The mystery spinner repaid the faith with a fifer and helped India defend a 249-run total.Now ahead of the Australia game, the Indian think-tank need to take the tough call of whether to retain the same XI or keep the additional seamer in either Harshit Rana or Arshdeep Singh. The Indian captain kept cards close to his chest but agreed it is ""tempting"" to stick to what worked for them on Sunday.The result on 19 November, 2023, broke a billion hearts and captain Rohit, too, was crestfallen. He stayed indoors for weeks after the game but when the next opportunity came his way, he let his bat do the talking in the 2024 T20 World Cup knockouts to settle some scores. On Wednesday, he will get another crack, this time to go one up, in the format which is very dear to him.",India take on Australia in the first semi-final of the ICC Champions Trophy in Dubai on Wednesday.

Rohit Sharma on India XI vs Australia, impact of Varun Chakravarthy and Dubai pitches

Congress spokesperson Shama Mohamed found herself at the center of a social media storm after her comments on India captain Rohit Sharma ’s weight sparked widespread backlash. Facing criticism from former cricketers, BJP leaders, and even her own party, Mohamed later defended her remarks, insisting they were not meant as body shaming.In a now-deleted post on X, she wrote, ""@ImRo45 is fat for a sportsman! Need to lose weight! And of course, the most unimpressive captain India has ever had!"" The post quickly drew strong reactions, prompting her to remove it.Speaking to ANI after the controversy erupted, Mohamed argued that her comment was merely an observation on an athlete’s fitness rather than an attempt to body shame Rohit. ""It was just a generic tweet about the fitness of a sportsperson. It is not body shaming. I always believe a sportsperson has to be fit. So I felt he's a bit overweight and I just tweeted on that,"" she said.She further justified her stance by comparing Rohit with past Indian captains like MS Dhoni, Sourav Ganguly, Rahul Dravid Kapil Dev and Virat Kohli . ""I have the right. It's a democracy. What is wrong in saying this?"" she questioned.Mohamed also referenced past incidents where cricketers faced criticism, including when Virat Kohli defended teammate Mohammed Shami after India's loss to Pakistan. ""Let's not forget how Virat was attacked when he supported Shami. A good captain leads from the front, scores runs, and acknowledges opponents’ performances,"" she added.Her remarks did not sit well with former cricketers. Speaking to ANI, Atul Wassan dismissed her comments, stating, ""He is a World Cup-winning captain. Her remarks should not be taken seriously as she doesn’t understand match fitness."" Rohit's former coach Dinesh Lad also came to his defense, highlighting his recent performances. ""If Rohit was not fit, he wouldn’t have scored a century against England in the ODI series,"" Lad said.Former selector Sarandeep Singh reinforced Rohit's athleticism, saying, ""Rohit doesn't look unfit from anywhere. He has been diving on the field and performing brilliantly. We all are proud of what he is doing.""The Congress party quickly distanced itself from Mohamed’s remarks. Party leader Pawan Khera clarified on X, stating, ""Her comments do not reflect the party’s position. She has been advised to exercise greater caution in the future.""With criticism mounting from both cricketing and political circles, Mohamed’s defense has done little to quell the storm surrounding her remarks on the Indian captain.","Congress spokesperson Shama Mohamed's comments on India captain Rohit Sharma's weight sparked widespread backlash.

Rohit Sharma on India XI vs Australia, impact of Varun Chakravarthy and Dubai pitches

Australia need to fill a spot at the top of the order for their semi-final against India on Tuesday, after a quadriceps injury ruled out Matthew Short for the remainder of the ICC Champions Trophy 2025.Former captain Ricky Ponting has declared he would back big-hitting youngster Jake Fraser-McGurk to slot in as Short's replacement for Australia's semi-final clash against India.Short picked up a quad injury in Australia's group match against Afghanistan. His absence promotes traveling reserve Cooper Connolly into the squad. The West Australian, like Short, is a powerful hitter and a capable off-spin bowler, proving to be a like-for-like replacement.While left-armer Connolly offers all-round value, Ponting is putting his faith in Fraser-McGurk.""He can slot straight into that position,"" Ponting said in The ICC Review. ""That's the way I would probably go — just hope he has one of his days. In must-win games like these, you need to throw caution to the wind.""Fraser-McGurk is known for his explosive batting in the shorter formats. He has featured in seven ODIs for Australia, striking at 132, though his returns have been inconsistent, averaging just 14 with a top score of 41.Ponting believes Fraser-McGurk's attacking mindset could prove decisive. ""He's the sort of player that, if you back him, he might just be good enough to win a big game for you.""Ponting also floated alternative options, including adjustments within the existing XI. ""They could move Steve Smith up to open. He's done a terrific job in T20 cricket in recent years and plays fast bowling well. That could help negate the new ball threat and get through to the middle overs.""Another possibility is wicketkeeper-batter Josh Inglis. ""They could put Inglis up there and leave someone like Connolly in the middle order, adding a left-hander and another spin option.""Despite these options, Ponting remains firm on Fraser-McGurk, citing his blistering IPL 2024 performance, where he struck at 234 across nine innings.""He's probably been a little disappointed with his output in the last six months,"" Ponting admitted. ""But this might just be the game where he can do something… like he did in the IPL with the Delhi Capitals last season.""",Australia need to fill a spot at the top of the order for their semi-final against India.

Varun Chakaravarthy after dream Champions Trophy debut: 'Virat, Rohit, Hardik helped calm me down'

BCCI Secretary Devajit Saikia responded on Monday to controversial comments made by Congress spokesperson Shama Mohamed about Team India captain Rohit Sharma 's physical appearance.Mohamed posted on social media platform X, later deleting it, suggesting that the Indian cricket team's captain needed to lose weight and called him the country's most unimpressive captain.Her comments came after Rohit Sharma scored 15 runs from 17 balls during Sunday's Champions Trophy match against New Zealand.""It's very unfortunate this kind of remarks come from such a person who is on a responsible post to our captain, on a meanwhile time when India is playing an ICC tournament and the team is all set to play Semi final,"" Devajit Saikia, BCCI Secretary said while speaking to news agencyThe controversy escalated when BJP criticised the Congress party, pointing out their electoral losses under Rahul Gandhi 's leadership while defending Sharma's captaincy.""It was a generic tweet about the fitness of a sportsperson.

Champions Trophy: Rohit Sharma back to his belligerent best in final training session

Do India have 'undeniable advantage' in the Champions Trophy?

Former Pakistan cricket legend Inzamam-ul-Haq has joined Saqlain Mushtaq in criticising the Board of Control for Cricket in India BCCI ) over the ongoing Champions Trophy controversy .The dispute emerged when England cricket experts Nasser Hussain and Mike Atherton pointed out that the Indian team gained an 'undeniable' advantage by playing all their matches at a single venue in Dubai.The Indian government's decision not to allow the national team to travel to Pakistan due to political tensions and security concerns led the ICC to schedule all India's matches in Dubai.""Keep aside the Champions Trophy. Top players participate in IPL but Indian players don't participate in other leagues. Other boards should stop sending their players to IPL. If you (BCCI) don't release your players for leagues, then other boards should take a stance,"" Inzamam said in an appearance on a Pakistani TV channel.BCCI's policy prevents Indian players from participating in overseas leagues unless they retire from Indian cricket, including IPL and domestic tournaments.

NEW DELHI: Spinner Varun Chakravarthy made a memorable ICC Champions Trophy debut on Sunday, producing a sensational five-wicket haul as India defeated New Zealand by 44 runs in their final group-stage match at Dubai International Cricket Stadium. His performance helped India secure a semi-final clash against Australia after topping Group A with an unbeaten record.Varun returned figures of 5 for 42, marking the best-ever bowling figures by an Indian in his Champions Trophy debut. He surpassed teammate Mohammed Shami’s 5 for 53 against Bangladesh in India’s tournament opener at the same venue. Overall, it was the second-best bowling performance by an Indian in Champions Trophy history, only behind Ravindra Jadeja ’s 5 for 36 against West Indies in the 2013 edition at The Oval.Adding another milestone, Varun became the fastest Indian bowler to claim a five-wicket haul in ODIs, achieving the feat in just his second match. The previous record was held by Stuart Binny, who picked up 6 for 4 against Bangladesh in Mirpur in his third ODI in 2014.The match also made history as the first instance of two five-wicket hauls in a single Champions Trophy game. New Zealand pacer Matt Henry returned identical figures of 5 for 42 during India’s innings, setting the stage for a thrilling contest.After receiving the 'Player of the Match' award, Varun expressed his emotions: ""First of all, I did feel nervous in the initial stages. I have not played many matches for India in the ODI format, but as the game went on, I felt better. Virat, Rohit, Shreyas and Hardik were talking to me, and that helped. (On when he knew he was playing) I found out last night. I was definitely expecting to play for the country, but on the other hand, I was nervous. It was not a rank turner, but if you bowled in the right places, it offered assistance. The way Kuldeep, Jaddu, and Axar bowled, even the pace bowlers, it was a total team effort.""Skipper Rohit Sharma explained the decision to include Varun in the playing XI, stating, ""He has something different about him, so we wanted to try and see what he can offer. We haven’t thought much about the next game yet, but it’s a good headache to have.""With this commanding victory, India now shift focus to the semi-final against Australia, where Varun’s mystery spin could play a key role in India’s title pursuit.","Varun returned figures of 5 for 42, marking the best-ever bowling figures by an Indian in his Champions Trophy debut.

NEW DELHI: India secured their place at the top of Group A with a commanding 44-run victory over New Zealand in their final group-stage fixture of the ICC Champions Trophy 2025 on Sunday at Dubai International Cricket Stadium .With the tournament now heading into the semi-finals, India are set for a high-stakes clash against Australia on Tuesday, March 4, in Dubai.Former India head coach Ravi Shastri weighed in on the team’s selection for the upcoming fixture, advocating for continuity in the playing XI given the quick turnaround.""The square is a little tired at the moment, people have run on the pitch that is going to be used the day after, so the spinners will again come into play,"" Shastri said, emphasising the importance of India’s spin attack.India fielded a four-pronged spin unit in their match against New Zealand, with Ravindra Jadeja, Axar Patel, Kuldeep Yadav and the relatively new Varun Chakravarthy leading the charge, while pacer Harshit Rana was rested. The strategy paid dividends as the spinners bowled 37.3 overs, accounting for nine of the ten New Zealand wickets, with Chakravarthy starring with a five-wicket haul.The spin-heavy attack successfully defended a target of 250, restricting New Zealand's batting lineup on a sluggish Dubai surface. Given the conditions and their proven success, Shastri is confident that a similar approach will work in the semi-final.""So if you bat first, put anything over 240-250, it’s going to be very competitive in a big game like a semi-final,"" Shastri said, underlining the need for a solid first-innings total to apply scoreboard pressure.India will now focus on maintaining their winning momentum against a formidable Australian side, with their spin arsenal expected to play a crucial role in the much-anticipated knockout clash.","India secured their place at the top of Group A with a commanding 44-run victory over New Zealand in their final group-stage fixture of the ICC Champions Trophy 2025.

'India will be worried vs New Zealand': Former NZ Cricket CEO David White

NEW DELHI: Indian cricket superstar Virat Kohli is well known for his on-field antics, which often entertain fans just as much as his batting heroics. From urging the crowd to cheer louder to mimicking his teammates, Kohli’s exuberance is always on display.During India’s final group-stage clash against New Zealand at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium in the ongoing ICC Champions Trophy 2025 in Dubai, another such moment went viral, leaving fans in splits.In a lighthearted and spontaneous gesture, Kohli playfully touched the feet of spinner Axar Patel after the all-rounder dismissed New Zealand’s top-scorer Kane Williamson during the match. The incident took place at the end of the 41st over of New Zealand’s run chase when Axar provided India with a crucial breakthrough.Williamson, who had scored a well-compiled 81 off 120 balls, attempted an aggressive stroke off Axar’s delivery, which was the spinner final delivery of the 10-over spell, but was completely beaten, allowing wicketkeeper KL Rahul to complete a simple stumping. As Axar celebrated the prized scalp, Kohli approached him and humorously bowed down to touch his feet in a gesture of respect, acknowledging the vital wicket. Axar, taken aback, attempted to evade the moment, leading to a brief, playful exchange between the two before they resumed their fielding positions.The wicket proved to be a turning point in the match. With Williamson’s dismissal, New Zealand’s chase faltered despite a brief cameo from Mitchell Santner (28 off 31 balls).

Champions Trophy: How good is Virat Kohli in football? | Rishabh Pant recovers from viral

NEW DELHI: India capped off their Group A campaign in the ICC Champions Trophy with a commanding 44-run victory over New Zealand, thanks to Shreyas Iyer ’s composed 79 and Varun Chakaravarthy’s stellar 5/42.The win secured India’s place at the top of the table and set up a highly anticipated semifinal clash with Australia.Despite Iyer’s fighting knock, India struggled early, losing three wickets for just 30 runs. New Zealand pacer Matt Henry produced a lethal spell, finishing with figures of 5/42 and restricting India to a modest 249/9. However, India’s spinners ensured it was enough as they bowled out the Blackcaps for 205 in 45.3 overs.After the match, Chakaravarthy admitted to initial nerves but credited his senior teammates for keeping him calm.""In 2021, I didn’t have a great tournament in Dubai, looks good right now. Team is doing well and it feels good. I was nervous during my first spell, previous outings here were playing on my mind. Virat bhai, Hardik bhai, Rohit bhai helped me keep my calm,"" Chakaravarthy said.He also reflected on how adapting his approach helped his success, adding, ""I try to sequence my spell in T20s and it’s a bit different in 50-over. Playing domestic cricket helped my awareness and allowed me to plan my spells better. It’s more of a patience game as the ball didn’t turn fast, it turned slow. The pitch was not a rank turner.""India’s spin attack was at its best, with Chakaravarthy leading the charge. His precise line and variations troubled New Zealand’s batters throughout their innings. Kane Williamson waged a lone battle with a classy 81 but lacked support as wickets kept tumbling.New Zealand’s chase never gained momentum after Hardik Pandya struck early to dismiss Rachin Ravindra. Williamson built a steady 44-run partnership with Daryl Mitchell, but Kuldeep Yadav broke the stand by trapping Mitchell lbw. The dismissals of Tom Latham (14), Glenn Phillips (12), and Michael Bracewell (2) in quick succession further dented New Zealand’s hopes.ALSO SEE: Watch: Ravindra Jadeja's animated reaction to Virat Kohli's dismissal breaks the internet Williamson showed his trademark elegance, playing crisp strokes, but his resistance ended when Axar Patel bowled a fuller delivery that led to a sharp stumping by KL Rahul.

""New Zealand are a good team playing some good cricket.

Australia have drafted young all-rounder Cooper Connolly into their ICC Champions Trophy squad as a replacement for the injured Matthew Short, just ahead of their semi-final clash against India in Dubai on Tuesday.Short sustained a calf injury while fielding during Australia's rain-affected match against Afghanistan in Lahore. The injury visibly hampered him, particularly when he made a quickfire 20 at the top of the order before rain led to the game being abandoned.Australia captain Steve Smith had earlier hinted that Short's recovery in time for the semi-final was unlikely.""I think he'll be struggling,"" Smith said after the match. ""We saw tonight he wasn't moving very well, and I think it's probably going to be too quick between games for him to recover.""Connolly, a left-handed batter and left-arm spinner, has played six internationals for Australia, including three ODIs.

& Co. Eye first ICC knockout win in ODIs against six-time world champions since 2011

TIMES VIEW The Champions Trophy scheduling lacks balance. While India is comfortably lodged at one venue, other countries not only hop from one city to another, but in some cases, also from one country to another. ICC should ensure such lopsidedness is avoided in future.

DUBAI: Ever since India's 44-win win over New Zealand in their last league clash guaranteed them of a semifinal encounter against world champions Australia on Tuesday at the Dubai International Stadium here, the social media scene is abuzz with memes of how a certain Travis Head would be again itching in anticipation of bashing up the Indian bowlers again!Indeed, on Nov 19, 2023 at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad, Head played the innings of his life-a blazing 137 off just 120 balls against a hapless India that gave Australia a resounding six-wicket win in the final of the ODI World Cup . Head's scintillating century broke the hearts of more than one lakh Indians inside the venue, and millions who were watching on TV.Almost 15 months later, as their team takes on Australia in an ICC knockout match again, India's fans have a genuine reason to feel afraid of an encore from the dangerous Head and the six-time ODI World Cup winners. It's certainly not a match-up India would've preferred, considering that history weighs heavily against them here-India haven't beaten Australia in an ICC knockout match since 2011.However, things are different this time. Powered by their deadly spin quartet -mystery spinner Varun Chakravarthy , who took five for 42 to dismantle New Zealand in the last league match of the tournament on Sunday night, is its latest member-and thriving on familiarity with the conditions at the Dubai International Stadium which has rightly been termed as ""unfair"" by many, Rohit Sharma & Co have a golden chance to avenge that 2023 ODI World Cup final defeat when they face off with a depleted Australia in a clash of the titans in the 2025 Champions Trophy semifinal here on Tuesday.For a change, when they take the field against an in-form, raging India, riding a three-match winning streak in what should be another spin-friendly track here, the Aussies will be the underdogs. In a big gamble, India picked as many as five spinners, drawing flak from many. However, the move has proved to be a masterstroke, as the slow pitch here has aided spin.Fired by a rare four-man spin attack, which took nine out of the 10 wickets that fell and bowled 128 dot balls in the 39 overs that they bowled amongst themselves, India overpowered the Kiwis on Sunday night. Even as the temptation to continue with this template is mouth-watering, they now face a big dilemma -whether to persist with Varun or bring back pacer Harshit Rana, who was rested for the last match.If he plays again, Varun could bamboozle the Aussies too. Describing what makes him such a tricky customer, Varun's spin bowling colleague Axar Patel said, ""It (his delivery) is very difficult to read from the hand, and the pace with which he bowls is very difficult. So, I think, if a batter misses (the line), there is a higher chance of getting out. He is fast in the air also.""In case they do decide to axe one out of the four spinners, the decision won't be easy as all four- Ravindra Jadeja , Axar Patel, Kuldeep Yadav and Varun have bowled well in Dubai.The Aussies, meanwhile, are missing their lead fast bowling cast of regular captain Pat Cummins, Josh Hazlewood and Mitchell Starc. As if not having their main pace bowling trio was not enough, they have also lost the services of explosive opener and part-time spinner Matthew Short, who had cracked a 66-ball 63 to play his part in Australia's epic 352-run chase against England at Lahore in their lung-opener and conceded just 0-21 in seven overs against Afghanistan, due to a calf injury. The current world champions have replaced Short with 21-year-old left-arm spinning allrounder Cooper Connolly, who has scored 10 runs in three ODIs so far.In comparison to India's overflowing spin cupboard, Australia have only one genuine spinner in leg-spinner Adam Zampa, with part-timers Glenn Maxwell and Travis Head as his support cast.Still, even though they have little resources, Australia can never be counted out of an ICC tournament, especially once they are in the knockouts.In the 2025 Champions Trophy, though, Australia's campaign, after they pulled off that stunning chase against England, most notably without much contribution from Head and captain Steven Smith, has been badly affected by rain. In ominous signs for India, Head looked almost back to his best against Afghanistan, having stroked a free-flowing 40-ball 59 before rain arrived to abandon the match. India's fans would be desperate to see the attacking left-handed opener head back to the pavilion as soon as possible.Australia's thin bowling line-up, which conceded 351 for eight against England and 273 against Afghanistan, needs to pull up its socks, albeit it must be said that Pakistan's wickets were batting beauties. Still, bowling to India's rampaging batting line-up-an in-form Shubman Gill, a now aggressive Rohit Sharma, an all-time ODI great Virat Kohli and the consistent Shreyas Iyer, who seems eager to prove a point, won't be easy for the Aussies.If India, the clear favourites here, do beat Australia, it will be their first win over the multiple time world champions in an ICC knockout stage since they famously downed Ricky Ponting's Aussies in the quarterfinal of the 2011 World Cup at Ahmedabad, thanks to half-centuries by the legendary Sachin Tendulkar (53), current head coach Gautam Gambhir (50) and Yuvraj Singh (57 not out).","India take on Australia in Champions Trophy semifinal on Tuesday. India haven't beaten Australia in an ICC knockout match since 2011. India are powered by their deadly spin quartet-Varun Chakravarthy, Ravindra Jadeja, Axar Patel and Kuldeep Yadav. Australia are missing their lead fast bowling cast of Pat Cummins, Josh Hazlewood and Mitchell Starc.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118696378,imgsize-93022,width-400,resizemode-4/118696378.jpg"

'Steve Smith cannot win a major tournament': Astrologer Lobo's huge prediction ahead of IND vs AUS semis

Rohit Sharma on India XI vs Australia, impact of Varun Chakravarthy and Dubai pitches

NEW DELHI: The pain of losing the 2023 ODI World Cup final to Australia on home soil still lingers for Team India. However, Rohit Sharma and his men will have a golden opportunity to settle the score when they face Australia in the semifinals of the ICC Champions Trophy 2025 in Dubai on Tuesday.India kicked off their Champions Trophy campaign with a commanding six-wicket win over Bangladesh, followed by another clinical six-wicket victory against arch-rivals Pakistan. They then capped off the group stage with a dominant triumph over New Zealand, securing the top spot in Group A.As Team India prepares for a high-stakes semifinal clash against Australia, astrologer Greenstone Lobo believes that the team has what it takes to avenge their World Cup heartbreak and emerge victorious on Tuesday.Lobo also predicts that India will secure a place in the final. In the 2023 ODI World Cup, Australia, under the leadership of Pat Cummins, stunned India on their home turf to lift the coveted trophy.""November 2023 is still fresh in the minds of many Indians. Now, they are eagerly anticipating the possibility of India avenging their loss against Australia in the Champions Trophy semifinal. In some way, this could help heal the scars of the 2023 World Cup final defeat. But is it possible? Can India beat Australia in the semifinal?,"" Lobo said.""Speaking about the 2023 World Cup, I was very confident about Rohit Sharma’s chart. I always believed he had a great chance to win the World Cup. However, Rohit had already won five IPL titles, while his opponent, Pat Cummins, had not won any major international tournament at the time. Cummins had all his karmic quota intact, which allowed him to lead Australia to victory.""Now, in 2025, two years have passed. Rohit Sharma has already won the T20 World Cup in 2024. If he beats Australia now, he will be in the final, with the potential to win another ICC trophy. The big question is: can he overcome Australia first, the biggest hurdle in his path? When analyzing the Australian squad, it is clear that they are significantly depleted. The team has suffered multiple injuries, and Pat Cummins' absence is a major blow. Cummins is their talismanic skipper, born in 1993 with Neptune and Pluto in very powerful positions. He arguably has the best horoscope among all players in the tournament—or even in the world at this moment. If not the absolute best, then certainly one of the top two, alongside Rohit Sharma.""Cummins not playing is a huge advantage for India. Adding to that, the Australian squad is now being led by Steve Smith, who was born in 1989. The biggest challenge in Smith’s horoscope is that two of the top three planets—Uranus and Pluto—are debilitated in his chart. This suggests that he lacks the planetary support needed to win a high-stakes tournament of this magnitude, where teams must triumph under extreme pressure. He simply does not have that kind of chart.""Australia’s biggest mistake was not appointing Travis Head as captain. Had they done so, India would have faced a much tougher challenge. Fortunately, that did not happen. Looking at the current squad, key players like Josh Hazlewood and Mitchell Starc are absent, which is a big advantage for India. Even Matthew Short may not play in this match. All of this makes Australia’s squad even weaker. Travis Head is there, but he has already cemented his reputation as a big-match player by winning the Man of the Match award in the 2023 World Cup final. However, legendary players don’t always replicate such performances in consecutive major events.""On the other hand, Rohit Sharma has an outstanding horoscope. Among all players born after the 1980s, he likely has the best chart—perhaps only second to the legendary MS Dhoni. As captain, Rohit is exceptional, and India has a phenomenal squad. We have Virat Kohli , who is still in great form. Then there’s Shreyas Iyer and Axar Patel. When asked about India carrying multiple spinners, Rohit clarified that it’s not about spinners but about having all-rounders. That statement is true—look at Hardik Pandya , Axar Patel, and Ravindra Jadeja.""From an astrological perspective, India has players whose planetary alignments are perfect for this period. Virat Kohli, born in 1986, has the strongest planets for his era. Rohit Sharma has the best planetary support for this time. Shreyas Iyer, born in December 1994, has the strongest planetary alignment for his phase. Overall, the Indian squad is far more astrologically balanced. This time, they will not let the opportunity slip away. They will not take Australia lightly. Instead, they will crush them and ensure that the painful memories of November 2023 are erased to a great extent. India is ready to storm into the final of the Champions Trophy 2025,"" he said.",Team India face Australia in the ICC Champions Trophy 2025 semis on Tuesday.

BENGALURU: In the summer of 1990, a bespectacled, lanky youngster from South Bengaluru caught the fancy of a cricket-besotted country. He combined dexterous skill in his craft of leg-spin with razor-sharp analytical competencies. It helped the youngster achieve unparalleled success as he eventually rose to become India captain and later head coach of the Indian team.But Anil Kumble believed he could go back to a 9-to-5 job anytime his cricket career was nearing its end.“A good fallback for me was that I had an engineering degree. So, if anything went wrong, I knew I could apply and at least land a 9-5 job,” said Kumble.The importance of education has not been lost on Kumble, and he never fails to pass on advice of the benefits of being schooled to budding sportspersons.“Education is an important aspect to being a successful sportsperson,” said Kumble on the sidelines of Tenvic , his company, and Manipal Academy of Higher Learning (MAHE) signing an MoU Monday for educational and infrastructural initiatives. “In my case, education helped me handle all the pressure on field and other external factors that enable you to go out there and play. It helps you perform better on the field because you feel a lot more secure. You do not have to worry about what happens if you get injured or dropped.”Weighing in on an ongoing debate on sport being the exclusive domain of the affluent, Kumble said: “I think it’s a fair scale. You need plenty of resources. In cricket, a bat or kit costs a lot of money. But it’s the responsibility of the athlete too. They must ask themselves, ‘how can I have a cushion or a fallback mechanism in case something goes wrong in my sport?’ It’s quite a challenge for everything to align.""Stressing on the deep-rooted relevance and impact of grassroots sport, Kumble said, “Gifted sports people will probably get a sponsorship or the support of an organisation. For others, it’s a massive challenge. We are trying to build a grassroots force so that interest in sport develops at a school-level. If you look at all the successful nations, the success comes from universities. They all go through a proper system — school, college and then university.”Concurring with Kumble, Vasanth Bharadwaj, former international table tennis player and co-founder of Tenvic, said, “We are committed to providing all resources that will address the three target audiences that we would intend to cater to. These are: Current competitive athletes who need academic support. Two, either recently retired athletes or ones contemplating retirement. The question is how does s/he prepare for life after sport? Three, every student who aspires to be part of the larger sporting ecosystem. How does s/he develop the skills?”MD Venkatesh, vice-chancellor, MAHE, stressed the importance of education for athletes , saying, “An important aspect of this MOU is to enable sportspersons to get academic qualifications. We are aware that sporting careers have a shelf life. Thereafter, they would like to look at what to do, how to do it, and also avenues to give back to sports.”","Anil Kumble believes education is an important aspect to being a successful sportsperson.

DUBAI: Australia, it seems, are ready for a ""spin trial by fire"" against a rampaging India in the semifinal of the 2025 ICC Champions Trophy at the Dubai International Stadium on Tuesday.On Monday, Australian captain Steve Smith , leading his team in the tournament in the absence of ace pacer Pat Cummins, asserted that his team was confident they would be able to tackle India's high-quality, four-pronged spinner attack in the last-four clash -- a rematch of the 2023 World Cup final , which was won by Australia in Ahmedabad.Playing in just his second ODI, ""mystery spinner"" Varun Chakravarthy took five for 42 on a spin-friendly Dubai pitch to bare India's spin fangs, which are the sharpest in the competition. India's other three spinners -- Ravindra Jadeja, Axar Patel and Kuldeep Yadav -- pose a big threat too.Asked how his team planned to nullify the dangerous Varun, Smith replied by asserting that the match would practically be decided by the winner of the battle between Australia's batters and India's spinners, which will be fought in the middle overs of Australia's innings.""Not just Chakravarthy, I think the rest of their spin is quality as well. So I think for us, the game is probably won and lost how we play their spin, particularly in the middle overs, the way we get through there. It's going to be a challenge. I think there's going to be some spin, by the looks of it. We've got to counter that. We've got a few options of ways we can go about it,"" Smith told the reporters.While they have a full-time spin options in leg-spinners Adaz Zampa and Tanveer Sangha, Smith said the Kangaroos could call upon their part-time spinners, including Travis Head and Marnus Labuschagne, to support Zampa and Glenn Maxwell on a track he felt ""looks to be a dry surface"".""We've got a lot of part-time options that could certainly play a role here and a couple of front-liners as well,"" Smith said.Smith seemed relaxed with the travel from Pakistan to Dubai to play India in the semis, playing down the whole controversy about India playing all their Champions Trophy matches at one venue.""We guessed right in the end (whether they would play India in Dubai). We had a little reset and a chance to have a couple of days here outside of a pretty strict sort of bubble, I suppose, in Pakistan with the security and stuff. It's been nice to just have a couple of days chill here, a bit of training,"" Smith said.Smith didn't agree that dashing Australian opener Travis Head would be under pressure to repeat his heroics of the 2023 ODI World Cup -- the left-hander smashed an unbeaten 137 to shape Australia's six-wicket win on that occasion, breaking millions of Indian hearts.""I mean, there's pressure every time you play in a big game. But, as we know, Travis has stood up in many of those in the past. And, you know, he looked in great touch the other night against Afghanistan. I'm sure he's going to be looking to come out here and play the same way he's played for a long time, with good intent, good aggression,"" Smith said about Head, who stroked a 40-ball 59 not out against Afghanistan in an abandoned match at Lahore.","Australia face India in the semifinal of the 2025 ICC Champions Trophy in Dubai.

BENGALURU: The quintessential team man that the former Rahul Dravid is, the former India captain battled injury and played until he had to be helped off the field, but his courage failed to lift the fortunes of Vijaya Cricket Club , Malur, in the semifinal of the KSCA Group III league tournament on Sunday. Against Jayanagar Cricketers , Vijaya CC crashed to a five-wicket loss.Hoping to help his team earn a promotion, Rahul played his second match of the tournament at the Kreeda Kshetra ground.

Champions Trophy: Varun Chakravarthy shocks New Zealand with spin magic

Australian captain Steve Smith emphasised the importance of spin bowling on Dubai's dry pitch ahead of their Champions Trophy semifinal against India on Tuesday. He highlighted that their success would depend on handling Indian spinners effectively.India showcased their spin strength by deploying four spinners against New Zealand in their final Group A match, securing a 44-run victory.""I think not just Chakravarthy, I think the rest of their spin has quality as well. So I think for us, the game is probably how we play their spin. Yeah, it's going to be a challenge,"" Smith said on Monday, on the eve of the last-four match against India.""I think there's going to be some spin and yeah, we've got to counter that. We'll see how we do that tomorrow. We've got a few options on how we can go about it,"" he added.Smith expressed optimism about Travis Head 's performance, noting his strong record against India in knockout matches.""There's pressure every time you play in a big game. But as we know, Travis has stood up in many of those in the past. You know, he looked in great touch the other night against Afghanistan.""I'm sure he's going to be looking to come out here and play the same way he's played for a long time with good intent, good aggression. Hopefully, he can get away in that power play and get results from that.""Smith addressed India's familiarity with the Dubai venue, where they've played all their matches.""India obviously played all the games here. So they've seen what the pitch is doing. I don't know if it is an advantage. Obviously, the whole square block is pretty dry. So, we've seen how the wickets are played.""Australia's arrival in Dubai followed their rain-affected match against Afghanistan, giving them time to prepare.""So, yeah, ideal to be here and have a couple of days' preparation. I think, had we stayed and waited for last night's result, we would have had to fly here today and play tomorrow, not get a chance to train on the surface, get used to the conditions that we have at the academy,"" he added.Smith discussed Australia's spin bowling options for the match.""We do have plenty of options there. We've got Maxwell. (Matthew) Short's obviously out now. It was a bit of a loss. He's been bowling quite nicely, bowled really well last game.""We have Cooper Connolly as well, if we go down that path.

But we've got some guys here that have performed nicely. It's good exposure for them to be able to play in an international tournament.""And I think they've handled themselves really well.

DUBAI: One of the finest left-arm spinners in the country, who was unlucky to not have played for India as he was played cricket in an era where the famous 'spin quartet' was at the peak of its powers, Mumbai stalwart Padmakar Shivalkar passed away on Monday at the age of 84.In an epic 20-year career which stretched from 1961-62 to 1987-88, ‘Paddy’ Shivalkar took a staggering 589 wickets in 124 first-class matches@19.69, with a best haul of eight for 16. Shivalkar, who made his Ranji Trophy debut at the age of 22, was recalled at the age of 48 for his last two first-class matches, with the Ranji Trophy quarterfinal against Delhi at the Ferozeshah Kotla in the 1987-88 season being his last FC game. Shivalkar took 361 Ranji wickets for Bombay (now Mumbai), the most by any bowler when he retired. He had 11 ten-wicket hauls (joint-second). Overall, he played 86 matches for Bombay, capturing 419 wickets.In local cricket, Shivalkar represented the famed Shivaji Park Gymkhana at Dadar and the Tata Sports Club. In 1961-62, he toured Australia with CCI and captured 15 wickets in three matches.In the Duleep Trophy, he scalped 74 in 15 matches for West Zone. In the Moin-ud-Daula, he scalped 23 wickets in seven matches. He played for Rest of India against Indian XI in a National Defence fund match in April 1972 at the Brabourne Stadium. He took five for 77, and his victims were Eknath Solkar, Gundappa Viswanath, Syed Abid Ali, S Venkatraghavan and Syed Kirmani. He took nine wickets in the match.In 2017, he received the CK Nayudu Lifetime Achievement Award, the highest honour conferred by the BCCI on a former player, along with fellow left-arm spin stalwart Rajinder Goel, who, like Shivalkar, was unlucky to not play for India despite a prolific record in domestic cricket. Both Shivalkar and Goel were unfortunately competing with left-arm spin great Bishan Singh Bedi, who finished with 236 Test wickets and 1560 first-class scalps, for a spot in India's Test side.Shivalkar toured Sri Lanka with a strong Indian side in 1973–74, playing in both matches against Sri Lanka and taking four wickets.“Mumbai cricket has lost a true legend today. Padmakar Shivalkar Sir’s contribution to the game, especially as one of the finest spinners of all time, will always be remembered. His dedication, skill, and impact on Mumbai cricket are unparalleled. His passing is an irreplaceable loss to the cricketing fraternity. May his soul rest in peace,” said Mumbai Cricket Association president Ajinkya Naik.Post his retirement, Shivalkar became a spin bowling coach, and was the Mumbai chief selector for a certain period. In the cricket community, he was known as a great singer too.As per an article by cricketMash in April 2020, Shivalkar played nine times against touring sides, accounting for 36 wickets. He toured Sri Lanka with the Indian side in 1973-74, capturing 11 wickets in four matches. In the first of the two unofficial ‘Tests’, he captured four for 115 before going wicketless in the other.Shivalkar also played in the Minor County Championships for Durham, representing them in five matches and capturing 13 wickets. He also went to South Africa with the India veterans team.His best bowling figures came in the final of the Ranji Trophy in 1972–73, when he took eight for 16 and five for 18 for Bombay against Tamil Nadu at Madras to script a 123-run triumph for Bombay. Succumbing to Shivalkar, TN were shot out for 80 and 61 on a rank turner which they had prepared for their spinners. In the previous season's semi-final, he had taken eight for 19 and five for 31 against Mysore.Just last month, on Feb 19, Mumbai’s cricket stalwart Milind Rege, who was an off-spinning allrounder, had passed away.Shivalkar studied at the Siddharth College of Arts, Science and Commerce in Fort, Mumbai.","Padmakar Shivalkar, one of India's finest left-arm spinners, has passed away at the age of 84.

NEW DELHI: Indian cricket legend Harbhajan Singh on Monday came out strongly against Congress spokesperson Shama Mohamed after she had fat-shamed Team India captain Rohit Sharma and questioned his leadership.The former cricketer took to social media to express his disappointment, calling the controversy “unfortunate and uncalled for.”“The controversy on the fitness of Rohit Sharma was unfortunate and uncalled for. He is an outstanding player and an exceptional leader who has made immense contributions to Indian cricket. Sportspersons are also human beings with emotion and sentiment. It indeed hurts when persons who have zero knowledge of the game give sermons. Respect the game and respect the players,” Harbhajan wrote on X.The controversy began late Sunday when Shama Mohamed took a swipe at Rohit Sharma following India’s Champions Trophy match against New Zealand.In a now-deleted post, she called the Indian captain “fat” and a “mediocre captain,” adding:“Rohit Sharma is fat for a sportsman! Needs to lose weight! And of course, the most unimpressive captain India has ever had!”Despite deleting the post, Shama continued her criticism in another tweet, questioning Rohit's stature compared to Indian cricketing greats like Sourav Ganguly, Sachin Tendulkar, Rahul Dravid, MS Dhoni, Virat Kohli, and Kapil Dev.Facing heavy backlash, Shama defended her remarks, claiming they were not meant to be body-shaming but rather an observation about an athlete’s fitness.SEE ALSO: 'Needs to lose weight': Congress leader fat-shames Rohit Sharma in post, deletes it later “It was a generic tweet about the fitness of a sportsperson.

What is wrong in saying this? It is a democracy,” she added.While the debate raged off the field, Rohit Sharma and Team India let their game do the talking.On Monday, India defeated New Zealand by 44 runs, with Shreyas Iyer’s composed 79 and Varun Chakravarthy’s five-wicket haul helping them top Group A.The Men in Blue now gear up for a high-stakes semifinal clash against Australia on Tuesday.","Harbhajan Singh slams Congress spokesperson Shama Mohamed for fat-shaming Team India captain Rohit Sharma.

NEW DELHI: FIFA, the international governing body for football, has lifted the suspension imposed on the Pakistan Football Federation ( PFF ) after the necessary constitutional amendments were implemented to ensure proper governance of the sport in the country.The suspension was initially imposed on February 5 due to the failure of PFF Congress members to amend the constitution as required by FIFA.However, on Thursday, the PFF Congress members reached a consensus and approved the necessary amendments to the constitution. A PFF official confirmed that FIFA informed them on Sunday that the suspension had been lifted.Since June 2019, Pakistan's football affairs have been overseen by a FIFA-appointed normalization committee, tasked with conducting elections and resolving disputes between parallel factions.Despite multiple changes in the committee's leadership over the past five years, the core issues facing Pakistani football remained unresolved.Last week, a senior official from the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) visited Lahore to persuade Congress members to adopt the required constitutional amendments.The changes were approved at a meeting in Lahore, paving the way for FIFA to lift the suspension.With the suspension lifted, Pakistan will now be eligible to participate in the 2027 AFC Asian Cup qualifiers . The national team is scheduled to face Syria in their Group 'E' opener on March 25.","FIFA has lifted the suspension imposed on the Pakistan Football Federation.

AC Milan suffered a 1-2 home defeat against Lazio on Sunday, with Pedro scoring a penalty in the eighth minute of stoppage time. The loss deepened the crisis for the seven-time European champions.Pedro's successful penalty shot moved Lazio to fourth place in the Champions League standings, positioning them one point ahead of Juventus before their Monday match against Verona.The penalty opportunity arose when Milan goalkeeper Mike Maignan fouled Gustav Isaksen, just after Samuel Chukwueze had equalised for Milan in the 85th minute.Milan, under Sergio Conceicao 's leadership, now sits in ninth place after a disappointing home performance. The team played with 10 men for over 20 minutes following Strahinja Pavlovic's dismissal for fouling Gustav Isaksen.Mattia Zaccagni initially appeared to have decided the match with his tenth goal of the season, scoring in the 28th minute, before Pedro's last-minute penalty sealed the win for Lazio.The match was overshadowed by fan protests at the San Siro. Milan's dedicated supporters delayed their entry into the stands until the 15th minute to express their dissatisfaction with the team's performance and club management.When fans finally entered, they withheld support, instead calling the players ""shameful"" and demanding American owners RedBird sell the club.Milan now trail 19 points behind local rivals and league leaders Inter Milan , and sit nine points away from Champions League qualification spots.Roma, Lazio's local rivals, continued their improvement under Claudio Ranieri with a 2-1 victory over 10-man Como, maintaining their pursuit of European qualification spots. Second-half goals from substitutes Alexis Saelemaekers and Artem Dovbyk secured Roma 's win, placing them in eighth position.Roma now stand four points behind sixth-placed Bologna, who defeated Cagliari 2-1 earlier on Sunday.

Barcelona secured a dominant 4-0 victory over Real Sociedad on Sunday, reclaiming the top spot in La Liga after a commanding performance at the Spotify Camp Nou. An early red card for Sociedad’s Aritz Elustondo gave Hansi Flick ’s side a significant advantage, allowing Gerard Martin, Marc Casado, Ronald Araujo and Robert Lewandowski to find the net in a comfortable win.Atletico Madrid had temporarily knocked the Catalans off their perch with a win over Athletic Bilbao on Saturday, while Real Madrid lost further ground in the title race with a defeat at Real Betis. Flick made several rotations ahead of Barcelona’s Champions League last-16 trip to Benfica on Wednesday but still managed to move one point ahead of Atletico.Real Sociedad, sitting ninth, started brightly but fell victim to Barcelona’s offside trap, with Sergio Gomez’s goal ruled out early on. Barcelona playmaker Pedri Gonzalez nearly capitalized on a mistake from Sociedad goalkeeper Alex Remiro, but his deflection landed just over the net. The game’s defining moment came in the 17th minute when Elustondo was sent off for pulling down Dani Olmo , who was racing through on goal.Barcelona took advantage quickly, opening the scoring eight minutes later when Olmo floated a cross to Martin, who fired home his first-ever senior goal. Four minutes later, Olmo was involved again—his wayward shot deflecting off Casado and into the net for Barcelona’s second. The young Lamine Yamal continued to impress, setting up Pedri, whose shot from the edge of the box was saved. Pedri came even closer after halftime, rattling the crossbar from distance.Shortly after, Araujo made it 3-0, reacting quickest after Remiro parried Lewandowski’s header from a corner. Lewandowski then wrapped up the scoring with a clever finish, diverting Araujo’s low drive past the goalkeeper. The 36-year-old now leads the La Liga scoring charts with 21 goals in 25 appearances.Barcelona controlled the final 30 minutes without much trouble, though substitute Ferran Torres came close to adding a fifth goal twice. Real Sociedad defender Javi Lopez admitted the red card changed the course of the game.Elsewhere, Valencia salvaged a 3-3 draw at Osasuna, thanks to a stunning backheel volley from Umar Sadiq in the 87th minute. The Nigerian striker scored twice to earn his side a valuable point in the relegation battle. Valencia, now 18th, sit one point above Alaves, who drew 1-1 at Mallorca earlier in the day. In another crucial result, Leganes (16th) edged Getafe 1-0, moving three points clear of the drop zone.Barcelona now shift focus to their Champions League last-16 first leg against Benfica on Wednesday, as they look to continue their pursuit of silverware across all competitions.","Barcelona beat Real Sociedad 4-0 to reclaim top spot in La Liga.

MUMBAI: It's been one of the classic fixtures in the Indian Super League in recent seasons, and Saturday was another example why.Reduced to 10 men in the 58th minute, harshly they might have felt, Mumbai City produced a spirited second half comeback to hold newly crowned champions Mohun Bagan SG to a thrilling 2-2 draw at the Mumbai Football Arena .In a season where the Islanders have often looked vulnerable at home, Petr Kratky's side appeared to be heading for another defeat here when they found themselves 2-0 down at halftime. The visitors showed no signs of any hangover from the 1-0 win over Odisha last Sunday which saw the Mariners become the first team in the ISL to defend the Shield.A fine finish by Jamie Maclaren in the 32nd minute followed by Dimitrios Petratos's tap-in from close range (41st) had the Bagan supporters in the stands buzzing.Around 1300 of them belonged to the Mumbai Pune Mariners fan club. “There was already a plan to come for this game as there was the possibility of the title being won here,” one of the supporters told TOI.Odisha's loss, of course, spared Mumbai that embarrassing likelihood, but the Islanders had more to gain from this fixture with their playoff berth far from guaranteed.The Islanders gave the home fans reason to believe in another comeback when a wellworked corner routine was finished off in fortunate fashion (57th). Bagan defender Thomas Aldred's headed clearance off Valpuia's rightfooted attempt saw the ball rebound off Jon Toral's knee into the goal.Less than a minute after the restart, Mumbai were reduced to 10 men when Vikram Partap Singh picked up a dubious second booking following a tussle with Subhasish Bose. As often happens in these situations, the sense of injustice appeared to galvanise Kratky's men, and they were duly rewarded with an 89th minute equaliser through Nathan Rodrigues.","Mumbai City produce a spirited second half comeback to hold newly crowned champions Mohun Bagan SG to a thrilling 2-2 draw at the Mumbai Football Arena.

The race to the Serie A title remains closely contested after Napoli held rivals Inter Milan to a 1-1 draw on Sunday, thanks to a late equaliser by Danish midfielder Philip Billing at the Stadio Diego Armando Maradona.The result keeps the reigning champions just one point behind league leaders Inter.With just three minutes left on the clock, Billing slotted in his maiden strike for Napoli, shortly after replacing Billy Gilmour.On loan from Bournemouth, the 32-year-old capitalized on a driving run from Stanislav Lobotka, reacting quickest to slot home after his initial effort was saved by Inter goalkeeper Josep Martinez.Until Billing’s intervention, Federico Dimarco’s stunning 22nd-minute free-kick looked set to secure a crucial victory for Inter in their title defense.Simone Inzaghi’s side found themselves under intense pressure for much of the match and had to rely on desperate defending in a bid to claim all three points.Inzaghi's plans were disrupted when both Federico Dimarco and Hakan Calhanoglu were forced off with injuries shortly after halftime, while Marcus Thuram also had to be replaced by Joaquin Correa in his first game back from an ankle injury.Inter could hardly have faced Napoli at a more opportune moment, with Antonio Conte’s side stumbling through February, collecting just three points from four matches after previously appearing destined for a second title in three seasons.However, despite Inter’s resilient defensive effort—marked by last-ditch tackles and desperate clearances—their resistance was finally broken by Billing, who rescued his new team in just his second appearance since signing in January.Billing’s late equalizer also offered a lifeline to Atalanta, who extended their winless run at home to five Serie A matches, but remain third, after a goalless draw against Venezia. They are three points behind Inter.Gian Piero Gasperini’s side are still in the title race but have struggled to deliver in front of their home fans, failing to win a domestic fixture in Bergamo since the start of the year. They missed a golden opportunity to draw level with Inter before the showdown in Naples.Davide Zappacosta came closest to scoring five minutes before halftime, striking the outside of the post after excellent work from Ademola Lookman.Lookman himself squandered a one-on-one chance against Venezia goalkeeper Ionut Radu earlier in the match and later blazed over from close range in the 82nd minute.",Philip Billing scores late equaliser as Napoli draw 1-1 with Inter Milan. The result keeps the reigning champions just one point behind league leaders Inter.

Mateta hospitalised in Palace win

Bournemouth edge Wolves in penalty shootout; Preston shock Burnley

Manchester City overcame a first-half scare to defeat Plymouth Argyle 3-1 at the Etihad on Saturday, securing their place in the FA Cup quarter-finals. Meanwhile, Crystal Palace advanced with a 3-1 victory over Millwall, but the match was overshadowed by a serious injury to striker Jean-Philippe Mateta.Plymouth, who stunned Premier League leaders Liverpool in the previous round, looked set for another shock when Maksym Talovierov’s 38th-minute header put the Championship side ahead.Argyle boss Miron Muslic had called the opportunity to face Pep Guardiola the ""biggest honour"" of his career, and his side nearly delivered a dream result. However, City's 19-year-old midfielder Nico O'Reilly stole the spotlight, scoring twice from set-pieces to turn the tie around.O'Reilly’s first goal just before half-time settled City's nerves, before he powered in Phil Foden's corner 14 minutes from time. Star striker Erling Haaland, who started on the bench, came on late and assisted Kevin De Bruyne for City’s third goal in stoppage time.Crystal Palace’s derby victory over Millwall was marred by a horrifying injury to Mateta, who was stretchered off after being accidentally kicked in the head by Millwall goalkeeper Liam Roberts just eight minutes into the match.Roberts, who initially won the ball, caught Mateta with his boot while clearing outside the penalty area. After a VAR review, referee Michael Oliver upgraded his initial decision to a red card.Palace manager Oliver Glasner was furious, stating the tackle could have ended Mateta's career. ""Just imagine if he hits his face straight, with his power, with the studs, it is the end of JP's career,"" he said.Mateta later reassured fans on Instagram: ""Thank you for all your kind messages. I'm doing well. I hope to be back very soon. And stronger than ever.""Palace capitalised on their numerical advantage, with Japhet Tanganga’s own goal opening the scoring in the 33rd minute. Daniel Muñoz doubled the lead before Millwall’s Wes Harding pulled one back in first-half stoppage time. Eddie Nketiah sealed the win for Palace with a late looping header.Bournemouth reached the quarter-finals for only the third time in their history after a dramatic 5-4 penalty shootout win over Wolves following a 1-1 draw.Evanilson’s first-half strike was followed by VAR controversy when Milos Kerkez had a goal ruled out for offside after an eight-minute review, due to a failure of the semi-automated system.Matheus Cunha equalised with a stunning strike for Wolves but was later sent off for violent conduct after clashing with Kerkez. In the shootout, Luis Sinisterra converted the winning penalty after Wolves' Boubacar Traoré hit the crossbar.Preston North End ended Burnley’s 23-game unbeaten run with a dominant 3-0 victory at Deepdale. Milutin Osmajic, who was previously accused of racist abuse by Burnley’s Hannibal Mejbri, taunted opposition fans after scoring the second goal.

NEW DELHI: Millwall goalkeeper Liam Roberts was involved in a reckless incident during Saturday's FA Cup match against Crystal Palace. Just eight minutes into the game, Roberts rushed out of his penalty area to clear a long ball, but his high left-footed follow-through struck Crystal Palace forward Jean-Philippe Mateta in the side of the face.Mateta, going unconscious immediately, sustained a serious injury and required lengthy medical attention on the field. He was fitted with a neck brace and carried off on a stretcher toward an ambulance.Palace said later on Saturday that Mateta had been discharged from hospital.Watch:Philippe-Mateta later said he is doing well and hopes to be back soon. ""Thank you for all your kind messages. I'm doing well. I hope to be back very soon. And stronger than ever. Well done guys for a great job today,"" Mateta posted on Instagram.The club confirmed he received 25 stitches. ""He received specialist treatment and 25 stitches to a severe laceration to his left ear. All scans were clear and JP is feeling well,"" the club said.""He will now rest and recuperate over the following days where his progress will be monitored by our club doctor.""According to Crystal Palace chairman Steve Parish, Mateta suffered a severe gash behind his ear and a head injury, necessitating a hospital visit. Parish expressed his disbelief at the challenge, describing it as the ""most reckless challenge on a football pitch"" he had ever witnessed in his time watching the sport.Palace manager Oliver Glasner said the challenge could have ended the Frenchman's career.""Just imagine if he hits his face straight, with his power, with the studs, it is the end of JP's career,"" said Glasner.""I'm pretty sure he didn't want to injure JP in this situation, but I also think that you have to decide when you make such an impact, you just can't do it in this way.""Initially, referee Michael Oliver did not issue a card for the challenge, despite being in close proximity to the incident. However, after being advised by VAR to review the incident on the pitch-side monitor, Oliver showed Roberts a straight red card.Mateta had scored eight goals in his previous nine games and has 15 in total for Palace this season. The 27-year-old also netted five times as France won silver at the Paris Olympics last year.Palace made use of the man advantage for virtually the whole game to book their place in the quarter-finals.Japhet Tanganga's own goal broke the visitors' resistance before Daniel Munoz prodded in a second.Wes Harding pulled a goal back for the Lions, 13 minutes into first-half stoppage time added on for Mateta's treatment.Palace were made to wait until 82 minutes to ensure progress when Eddie Nketiah's looping header found the far corner.",Millwall goalkeeper Liam Roberts sent off for reckless challenge on Jean- Philippe Mateta. Roberts' high boot struck the Crystal Palace forward in the side of the face. Mateta was taken to hospital with a head injury and received 25 stitches.

WTA Merida Open

Mérida:

World number four Jessica Pegula powered to her first WTA title of 2025 on Sunday, beating McCartney Kessler 7-5, 6-2 in an all-American final in Austin, Texas.Pegula, the top seed, claimed a seventh WTA title and her first since she won the 1000 event in Toronto last year.That was one of Pegula's two titles in a 2024 campaign in which she also reached the US Open final.In Kessler she stopped a fast-rising talent, whose first two WTA finals had yielded a pair of titles -- in Cleveland last August and at Hobart in January.The 25-year-old arrived in Austin riding high after claiming her first career top-10 player with an upset of Coco Gauff in the second round at Dubai.But she couldn't find a way past Pegula, who snapped a three-match losing streak in finals for a confidence-building crown heading into the prestigious hard court tournaments at Indian Wells and Miami.Pegula, the only top-10 player in the draw, dropped just one set all week.Kessler looked set to change that when she rallied from 0-2 down to take a 4-2 lead in the first set.But too many unforced errors from Kessler allowed Pegula to get back in front and after Kessler missed a chance to break in the 11th game she was broken in the next as Pegula pocketed the first set.Kessler broke Pegula to open the second, but Pegula won the next four games to seize control.Top-seeded American Emma Navarro capped a dominant week with a 6-0, 6-0 thrashing of qualifier Emiliana Arango in the final of the WTA Merida Open on Sunday.Navarro, seeded No. 1 for the first time, marched to her second WTA title without dropping a set, adding the 500-level crown to the title she won in Hobart last year.Navarro hadn't reached a final since, although she made it to the quarter-finals or better at the last three Grand Slams and came into the week ranked 10th in the world.She needed just 55 minutes to subdue Arango, becoming the first player to win a WTA final 6-0, 6-0 since Iga Swiatek blanked Karolina Pliskova in the 2021 Rome title match.Arango, a 24-year-old Colombian who made it past the quarter-finals of a WTA tournament for the first time this week, came into the tournament ranked 133rd in the world and will crack the top 100 when the new rankings are announced on Monday.","Jessica Pegula wins WTA title in Austin, Texas.

DUBAI: The US Open's decision to cut and change the draw of its mixed-doubles event has divided the locker-room on the men's and women's tours. The Open's plan is to reschedule mixed-doubles as a standalone feature during the qualifying draw, tossing out $1 million in prize-money.This year's mixed-doubles event in New York, perhaps inspired by the vibe of last year's 'Mixed Madness' mela, will feature 16 pairs as against the 32 that make up mixed-doubles draws at Grand Slams. It will be played on August 19-20, three days before the start of the main draw. The qualification process has also been changed, with eight teams earning direct entry courtesy their combined singles ranking, while the other eight teams will be wildcard entries. Rohan Bopanna , still going strong in doubles at almost 45 years, said it was a lost opportunity for doubles specialists, who look forward to playing two events in Grand Slams -- doubles and mixed doubles. ""I don't think any doubles players can really play the mixed doubles. This year's US Open will be the first Grand Slam where we are not playing two events,"" Bopanna told TOI on the sidelines of the Dubai Duty Free Tennis championships here.Bopanna believes doubles is still a popular option for singles players on the ATP Tour. ""All the guys who enjoy doubles play doubles on the circuit,"" Bopanna said. ""The system is such that you can use singles ranking to get into doubles, on the ATP Tour you see a bunch of guys playing doubles and they enjoy it.""Yuki Bhambri, the India No.2 in the individual doubles ranking, said the USTA knew exactly what they were doing when they wrung in the changes. ""Grand Slams especially have always talked about tradition, that's why they never want to shorten matches,"" he said. ""They do that when it suits them, obviously business over (other) interests. The mixed doubles for a lot of countries like Great Britain, India and Australia has been a source of Grand Slam achievement. You're never going to get an opportunity like that with what they've done.""""You're essentially having the singles guys play a practice week,"" the 32-year-old Bhambri said, adding, ""It is obviously a sad day and a loss for a lot of the doubles players. We've all spoken about that, everyone is aware of what they've done and how they've gone about it.""Last year's Mixed Madness exhibition event before the start of the main draw saw a number of high-profile singles players pairing up. American Coco Gauff said she wouldn't be playing the mixed event this time even though she enjoyed being a part of Mixed Madness last year. ""It's an interesting situation because (on one side) some (players) rely on mixed doubles and it's an event that's been there forever. On the other hand, I know they're trying to get more singles players involved, maybe grow the sport,"" Gauff said, ""I most likely won't be participating just because it's not a great time for me, it will take away from the preparation for US Open.""",The US Open has cut and changed the draw of its mixed-doubles event.

DUBAI: The thread running through Stefanos Tsitsipas ’ run at the Dubai Duty Free tennis championship this week has been his fight, not the lack of it. The gifted Greek appeared lost on the court for most part of the last couple of years, and it gradually reflected on his ranking which dipped out of the top-10 for the first time in five years last Feb.The 26-year-old backed himself with successive three set wins over Karen Khachanov and Matteo Berrettini to make the last-four here, his first ATP 500 semis since last July. Tsitsipas then beat Dutchman Tallon Griekspoor 6-4, 6-4 to make the final, where he meets Felix Auger-Aliassime .""The ability to fight is the most important one for an athlete, once you lose that, you are useless on the court,"" Tsitsipas said. ""There is no match without fighting, you have to fight. The best victories are the ones you fought for. You’re not in control (of the match) and you somehow find that little gap and you win the match, that’s the most thrilling moment a tennis player can experience.""You feel a little lost, not that confident with certain things that you have done to your game,"" Tsitsipas said of the road back. ""It’s difficult to fake the confidence. It helps if you win, and you see yourself in the level that you are kind of imagining in your mind. That brings you confidence.""The World No.11 – a six-time Grand Slam semifinalist, and twice finalist at Roland Garros (2021) and Australian Open (2023) – rued the lost opportunity of seasons gone.

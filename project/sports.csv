Poll What do you think is the main reason for SRH's disappointing performance this season? Injuries to key players Challenging playing conditions Inconsistent batting

Sunrisers Hyderabad head coach Daniel Vettori addressed the team's disappointing IPL 2025 campaign following their washout against Delhi Capitals at Hyderabad on Monday. After starting as trailblazers with an aggressive batting approach, SRH managed only three wins in 11 games, with Vettori citing unexpected playing conditions and tricky surfaces as key factors in their performance.The conditions at Hyderabad's home ground proved challenging this season, with teams crossing the 200-run mark in only four out of 11 innings, compared to seven out of 12 times last year.""I definitely did not say after every match I was backing an aggressive approach. I said we are about assessing conditions and this year, the conditions weren't as we expected. If you look at last year, there were a lot of high-scoring games here,"" Vettori stated during the post-match press conference.""These surfaces in particular have been a little bit different. It has been tricky, it has not been easy for the batters. All we have talked about is assessing conditions, trying to read the game, and understand what to do in certain situations. I think the guys are innately aggressive, but certainly, this season has been about trying to establish what's been required on the day,"" he added.The coach elaborated on the varying nature of pitches this season, with two surfaces supporting high scores while others favoured fast bowlers.""There have been two surfaces that have been 250-plus, and there have been four here that have been probably more conducive for the fast bowlers. Not so much the spinners but the new ball has been a little bit sticky, hard to hit, not coming onto the bat. The IPL has some of the best new-ball bowlers in the world, and they were able to exploit those conditions,"" Vettori explained.SRH's playoff hopes were dashed after the washout against DC, where they had restricted the opposition to 133/7 before rain intervened.""Obviously, it is disappointing. We came in with high hopes, but we have not been consistent enough with our performances. I have spoken to you guys a number of times around just not being able to put complete performances together. Today was the start of a complete performance, so it is frustrating that we could not finish it, but that is cricket,"" Vettori commented.Captain Pat Cummins showed impressive form, taking 3/19 including a wicket on the first ball, removing Karun Nair. The decision to drop Mohammed Shami, who struggled with six wickets in nine games at an average of 56.16, was based on conditions.""It has obviously been a tough season so far for Shami. But he has been working exceptionally hard in the background. We just saw, particularly on this Hyderabad wicket, that is the best make-up of this team for us,"" Vettori said regarding Shami's exclusion.Praising Cummins' versatility, Vettori stated: ""If you look at his overall performance, he's been able to be a wicket-taker. He has bowled [in] a number of different roles for us. He has been able to mix and match depending on who has been selected in the team. Today, I think was the first [second] time he took the first over and you can see why he's such a dominant Test-match bowler when he gets the opportunity. Pleasing for him to be able to turn up today and bowl so well and lead the team exceptionally well. Hopefully, that carries onto the last three games of the season.""In the washed-out match, DC recovered from 29/5 through Tristan Stubbs (41- off 36 balls) and Ashutosh Sharma (41 off 26 balls) to post 133/7.The result left DC in fifth position with 13 points from six wins, four losses, and a no-result, while SRH remained eighth with seven points from three wins, seven losses, and a no-result.","Sunrisers Hyderabad have been eliminated from IPL 2025 playoff contention following their abandoned match against Delhi Capitals.

Poll Should the BCCI limit salaries for uncapped players? Not sure Only for certain players No, players should earn what they can Yes, to ensure fairness

NEW DELHI: Cricket legend Sunil Gavaskar has criticized the Board of Control for Cricket in India BCCI ) for altering its rules to accommodate MS Dhoni as an “uncapped player” ahead of the 2025 Indian Premier League (IPL) season. In his column in Sportstar, Gavaskar raised alarm over the soaring salaries of uncapped players, cautioning that such moves could damage the future of Indian cricket.The BCCI revived a rule — scrapped in 2021 — that allows an Indian player who hasn’t played international cricket in five years to be considered “uncapped.” This enabled Chennai Super Kings to retain Dhoni for Rs 4 crore under the uncapped player category.“To accommodate Mahendra Singh Dhoni , who became an uncapped player before the auction last year, the limit was raised to Rs 4 crore,” Gavaskar noted, calling the move a disappointing example of convenience over merit.He also questioned the value of splurging on untested talent. “A whole lot of the players bought for huge amounts simply fade away as their hunger and drive are satiated... Indian cricket takes a bit of a beating at the loss of any player whether he has been successful or not,” he wrote.“In all these years, it is hard to recall an uncapped player bought for huge numbers who has justified his inclusion in the team,” Gavaskar added, while noting that players often perform better once price and pressure drop.Gavaskar urged the BCCI to reverse the rule change and limit salaries for uncapped players to safeguard Indian cricket’s long-term interests.",The BCCI revived a rule that allows an Indian player who hasn’t played international cricket in five years to be considered “uncapped” This enabled Chennai Super Kings to retain Dhoni for Rs 4 crore under the uncapped player category.

Brief Scores

Delhi Capitals:

Persistent rain forced match officials to call off the match between Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) and Delhi Capitals (DC) at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium on Monday.SRH now have seven points from 11 matches and are out of contention for the playoffs, while DC moved to 13 points from 11 games and sit fifth on the table.The match was called off due to a wet outfield. The two captains shook hands as both teams shared a point each. SRH have been officially knocked out of the competition, becoming the third team after Chennai Super Kings and Rajasthan Royals to be eliminated from the playoffs race.Earlier, after being sent in to bat, DC suffered a top-order collapse but recovered to post a respectable score following a 66-run partnership in 45 balls between Tristan Stubbs (41 not out) and No. 8 Ashutosh Sharma (41) for the seventh wicket.DC were reduced to 29/5 in 7.1 overs after incisive spells from SRH skipper Pat Cummins (3/19) and Jaydev Unadkat (1/13).SRH captain Pat Cummins set the tone, bowling well on a wicket that assisted the pacers. He dismissed Karun Nair off the first ball of the innings, then Faf du Plessis, and finally Abhishek Porel, putting DC under significant pressure.Axar Patel and KL Rahul tried to break free but couldn't establish a strong partnership. Vipraj Nigam had a brief stay before he was run out after a significant misunderstanding between the wickets with Tristan Stubbs.Then Stubbs was joined by impact substitute Ashutosh Sharma, who batted extremely well. Sharma scored a feisty 41 in quick time, which allowed DC to breach the 130-run mark.Stubbs tried to accelerate but struggled as the wicket wasn't the easiest to play shots on.SRH needed 134 runs to win the match, but not a single ball was bowled in their innings as it started pouring down during the innings break.133/7 in 20 overs (Ashutosh Sharma 41, Tristan Stubbs 41 not out; Pat Cummins 3/19, Jaydev Unadkat 1/13) vs Sunrisers Hyderabad",Sunrisers Hyderabad vs Delhi Capitals match abandoned due to rain.

Poll Is dual responsibility affecting Rishabh Pant's captaincy? It's hard to tell No, he can handle both Yes, it seems overwhelming

Bombay Sport Exchange Ep 4: Prof. Ratnakar Shetty on BCCI, cricket politics & Indian cricket's growth

NEW DELHI: With Rishabh Pant enduring a torrid IPL 2025 season, former Australia captain Aaron Finch has suggested a bold change: the Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) skipper should hand over wicketkeeping duties to Nicholas Pooran to improve on-field communication and regain clarity in leadership.Pant’s struggles continued in LSG’s 37-run loss to Punjab Kings , where he scored a sluggish 18 off 17 in a daunting 237-run chase. With just 128 runs from 10 innings at a strike rate of 99.22, this marks his worst IPL showing since his debut in 2016.Speaking on Jiostar, Finch highlighted how the dual role of captain and keeper could be hampering Pant’s effectiveness. “It must be really difficult to captain a side when you're the wicketkeeper. You probably get a couple of seconds to talk to your bowler between overs, and with the stop-clock rule, that time is minimal,” Finch explained.He added that Pooran often acts as the communication bridge between Pant and the bowlers but emphasised that indirect messaging can disrupt strategy execution. “That can be really difficult — the bowler's plan might change ball to ball, and so might Rishabh’s. You can see how animated and frustrated he is when things don’t go to plan.”Finch advised Pant to step out of the gloves temporarily: “Maybe it’s time he says, ‘Pooran, you take the gloves. I need to get rhythm, manage plans better, and talk to my attack directly.’”He pointed out how captains like Shreyas Iyer and Shubman Gill maintain constant communication from inside the ring — something Pant might benefit from replicating.With LSG now in a must-win zone, leadership clarity could be vital in their playoff push.",Lucknow Super Giants skipper Rishabh Pant is enduring a torrid IPL season.

SRH vs DC IPL 2025, Hyderabad weather prediction

Delhi Capitals will aim to revive their playoff hopes and arrest a two-match losing streak at home when they face a struggling Sunrisers Hyderabad in a must-win IPL 2025 clash on Monday. Axar Patel’s side, currently fifth with 12 points from 10 games, have relied heavily on away wins but will need to find form in familiar conditions to stay in the top-four race.Axar, who bruised his left hand in the previous game against KKR but still smashed a valiant 43, remains a fitness concern. His full bowling involvement could be key, especially against an SRH side all but out of playoff contention after a 38-run loss to Gujarat Titans.While KL Rahul and Abhishek Porel have led DC's batting, their inability to accelerate at crucial moments has been costly. However, Mitchell Starc and Mukesh Kumar form a potent attack, with Axar's presence adding balance.SRH, despite big names like Pat Cummins, Mohammed Shami, Travis Head, and Heinrich Klaasen, have failed to click. Pacer Jaydev Unadkat pointed to inconsistent bowling and pitch conditions as major hurdles.With both teams desperate for points, the match promises high stakes and intensity at Arun Jaitley Stadium.A scorching day in Hyderabad, and the pitch is an absolute belter. Dry, hard, and full of runs, it promises a high-scoring contest with a par score expected around 220–230. The dimensions offer some imbalance — 63 meters to the right, 70 to the left, and 77 down the ground — giving batters plenty to target. While the surface heavily favours batters, both sides possess quality seamers who could make early inroads. The only grass lies behind the stumps, offering no real help to bowlers. Dew hasn't played a major role at this venue, so the toss is unlikely to be decisive.Abhishek Sharma, Ishan Kishan, Nitish Kumar Reddy, Heinrich Klaasen (wk), Aniket Verma, Kamindu Mendis, Pat Cummins (c), Harshal Patel, Jaydev Unadkat, Zeeshan Ansari, Mohammed ShamiImpact Player – Travis HeadFaf du Plessis, Abishek Porel (wk), Karun Nair, KL Rahul, Axar Patel (c), Tristan Stubbs, Vipraj Nigam, Mitchell Starc, Kuldeep Yadav, Dushmantha Chameera, Mukesh KumarImpact Player - Sameer RizviPat Cummins (c), Ishan Kishan (wk), Atharva Taide, Abhinav Manohar, Aniket Verma, Sachin Baby, Smaran Ravichandran, Heinrich Klaasen (wk), Travis Head, Harshal Patel, Kamindu Mendis, Wiaan Mulder, Abhishek Sharma, Nitish Kumar Reddy, Mohammed Shami, Rahul Chahar, Simarjeet Singh, Zeeshan Ansari, Jaydev Unadkat, Eshan Malinga.Axar Patel (c), Jake Fraser-McGurk, Abishek Porel, Karun Nair, KL Rahul (wk), Tristan Stubbs, Ashutosh Sharma, Vipraj Nigam, Mitchell Starc, Kuldeep Yadav, Mohit Sharma, Mukesh Kumar, Sameer Rizvi, Darshan Nalkande, Donovan Ferreira, Tripurana Vijay, Dushmantha Chameera, Faf du Plessis, T Natarajan, Ajay Jadav Mandal, Manvanth Kumar L, Madhav Tiwari.Played: 25SRH wins: 13DC wins: 12Hyderabad will see mostly sunny conditions through the day following late-night showers.

Poll Is Shubman Gill the future face of Indian cricket? Too early to say No, there are better options Maybe, depends on his performance Definitely

Bombay Sport Exchange Ep 4: Prof. Ratnakar Shetty on BCCI, cricket politics & Indian cricket's growth

NEW DELHI: The Ajit Agarkar-led India men's senior selection committee is likely to pick the squad for India tour of England in the second week of May and a lot of debate and deliberation is already underway as far as captaincy for the five-Test series is concerned. Rohit Sharma and Jasprit Bumrah were the captain and vice-captain, respectively, during the tour of Australia in December-January but the combination is highly unlikely to continue in England.In Australia, Rohit's returns were far from ideal - 31 runs in three Tests - and he didn't feature in the last Test at the Sydney Cricket Ground (SCG). Bumrah led in his absence but went on to miss a lot of cricket after that due to a back injury.Those in the know say the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) is keen on including Shubman Gill in the leadership group for the away series starting on June 20. The classy right-hander is already the vice-captain in ODIs and T20Is, and could find himself in a similar role in the longest format.There is a lot of chatter around Rohit's captaincy in Tests and while he has shown the desire to lead in England, there are no guarantees yet. It is reliably understood that another senior player, who sensed a leadership vacuum, expressed desire to have the captaincy armband again. That, however, was not entertained by the Indian cricket board as they are clear on grooming a player for the future.""A new WTC cycle is starting. Future and continuity has to be kept in mind as far as the team is concerned. Even coach Gautam Gambhir would want a set of players he is likely to work with for an extended period. There can't be any stop-gap solutions for such an important series. The last two Test series haven't been ideal for the team and the England series is very crucial,"" said a source tracking developments.The 25-year-old Gill has had a lot of success in ODIs but is still a work-in-progress in Test cricket. He asked for a No. 3 position but the returns are far from the high standards he sets for himself. The England tour could well be the litmus test for Gill who hasn't enjoyed a lot of success away from home in his 32-Test career. Of Gill's 1893 Test runs, 1177 have come at home while only 649 have come on foreign soil.The BCCI, however, is looking at him not just from a cricketing and leadership talent perspective but also as a player who has the potential to become the face of Indian cricket. He continues to be in high demand as far as brands and sponsorships are concerned, and continues to put the right foot forward in the field. His captaincy for Gujarat Titans in the ongoing Indian Premier League (IPL) has impressed the men who matter, and what has stood out is how it hasn't affected his batting at all.It is only a matter of time before Gill is elevated to the leadership role even in Tests but the question is, could it come in England? The chances are very high at the moment.","The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) is keen on including Shubman Gill in the leadership group for the away series starting on June 20.

Watch the FUN conversation between Preity Zinta and PBKS' youngest player Prabhsimran Singh

Poll Should Prabhsimran be nominated for the Player of the Season award? Not sure Too early to decide No, there are better candidates Yes, he deserves it

New Delhi: On Sunday evening, the Singh household in Patiala was glued to the television set watching their son Prabhsimran Singh 's belligerent stroke-play, which guided Punjab Kings (PBKS) past Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) by 37 runs , and put them on the second spot on the Indian Premier League IPL ) points table and a step away from a guaranteed playoff spot.It has been a bittersweet few weeks for the Singhs. While Prabhsimran is scoring heaps of runs for the PBKS -- 437 runs in 11 innings at a strike rate of 170 -- his father Sardar Surjit Singh is on dialysis as both of his kidneys are failing.The morning after, Surjit asked his elder brother Satwinderpal Singh whether Simmu (Prabhsimran's nickname) had won the Player of the Match award or not. ""The only time he smiles these days is when he sees Prabhsimran bat in the IPL,"" Satwinderpal Singh told TimesofIndia.com from Patiala.""He is going through dialysis thrice a week. As an elder brother I can't see the pain he is enduring. I have to step out of the house when the doctors come home for the dialysis. Not a day has gone by that I have not prayed that it should not be my younger brother,"" said Satwinderpal Singh, who has trained Prabhsimran along with his own sons Anmolpreet Singh and Tejpreet Singh.Satwinderpal doesn't know how long his younger brother will survive, but he has found a way to put a smile on Surjit's face.""Before every Punjab Kings match, I carry him to the living room. We watch the match together, and every time the camera is on Simmu, he smiles. If Simmu scores, he keeps on smiling and laughing. In those moments, he forgets the pain he is in. If Simmu plays a rash shot, he shouts, 'khotte aaram naal khel (play sensibly).'""""Simmu video called on Monday morning to take an update about Surjit. And my brother gave him back by saying why he threw away his wicket after getting so close to the hundred,"" said Satwinderpal with a laugh.""While shouting at Simmu, he gasps for breath. Every time I have to intervene and tell him to praise the kid, because he is playing so well.""Since the start of the season, there has been a lot of talk about the sense of maturity in Prabhsimran Singh's batting. He has looked composed with steely resolve and is not ready to throw away his wicket after a flashy cameo.Before heading for the Punjab Kings camp, he had promised his elder brother Anmolpreet that he would score two centuries this season. He had made the same promise to his father, his uncle, and Ricky Ponting as well. The promise is still unfulfilled, but his onslaught has provided a breath of fresh air to PBKS, who had shown faith in him for the last six seasons, and they are finally reaping the rewards.""I think you're starting to see why I was so keen to retain Prabhsimran. He's a very, very good young player, and he's very keen to bring success to this team, and that showed with the way that he played tonight,"" Ponting told reporters after the match in Dharamsala.""I sort of challenged him in the team meeting to go on and get a 100 in this match, and unfortunately, Prabh fell just a little bit short of that,"" he added.After scoring a whirlwind 91, Prabhsimran has joined the elite list of KL Rahul and Chris Gayle by scoring three consecutive half-centuries for Punjab Kings in the IPL.""I had a lot of confidence from my last innings. I got a chance early on and I was able to capitalise. I’m playing the ball on its merit, and I want to thank the management as well for backing me. I felt I could take a bit of time after the powerplay. When you get set, when you have already scored 30-35, you need to convert it into something big,"" he told the broadcasters during the mid-inning break.Prabhsimran with the bat is not only helping Punjab Kings qualify for the playoffs for the first time in a decade but also adding more days to his ailing father's life.""Every time Simmu does well, I think it adds a few days to Surjit's life,"" said Satwinderpal, who wants his ward to help Punjab win the IPL trophy.",Prabhsimran Singh has scored 437 runs in 11 innings at a strike rate of 170.

Sachin Tendulkar at 52: Power, Pride, and a Nation’s Pulse

Rishabh Pant lost both his grip on the bat and on the match, as Punjab Kings delivered a commanding 37-run win over Lucknow Super Giants at the HPCA Stadium in Dharamsala on Sunday. The victory was built on a stunning 48-ball 91 from Prabhsimran Singh and a fiery spell from Arshdeep Singh , who dismantled LSG’s top order with figures of 3/16 in four overs.Prabhsimran’s blitz helped PBKS post a daunting 236/5. In response, LSG were restricted to 199/7, with only Ayush Badoni (74 off 40) offering resistance. Even if Lucknow win all their remaining games to reach 16 points, their poor net run rate could keep them out of the playoffs race.Arshdeep's early burst removed three key batters—Mitchell Marsh (0), Aiden Markram (13), and Nicholas Pooran (6)—within the Powerplay, virtually sealing the game for Punjab inside the first six overs.Punjab have now jumped to second on the points table with 15 points from 11 matches, needing just one more win to likely confirm a playoff berth.However, questions continue to swirl around LSG captain Rishabh Pant’s form. The ?27 crore acquisition has scored just 128 runs in 11 innings at a strike rate under 100 (99.22).On Sunday, he managed only 18 off 17 before a wild slog against Azmatullah Omarzai ended in a comical dismissal, with his bat flying one way and the ball the other.Pant's struggles reflect LSG’s season-long woes—particularly their weak bowling unit, shaped by poor auction decisions. Pace spearhead Mayank Yadav, returning from rehab, looked a shadow of his former self and was hammered for 60 runs in four overs, conceding six sixes.Prabhsimran, meanwhile, was unstoppable. After a solid opening from Jos Inglis, who smashed Mayank for three sixes in an over, Prabhsimran took charge. Partnering with Shreyas Iyer (45 off 25), he built a 78-run stand before falling just nine runs short of a well-deserved hundred, attempting a switch hit.Shashank Singh’s late cameo (33 off 15) further lifted PBKS to a massive total that proved too much for LSG to chase.",Punjab Kings beat Lucknow Super Giants by 37 runs. Prabhsimran Singh scored 91 from 48 balls. Arshdeep Singh took 3/16 in four overs.

Former Pakistani cricketers, including World Cup-winner Javed Miandad and Basit Ali , have strongly reacted to Sunil Gavaskar 's recent comments suggesting Pakistan's likely absence from the upcoming Asia Cup co-hosted by India and Sri Lanka due to political tensions between the nations.The situation has escalated following a deadly attack on tourists in Kashmir that resulted in 26 casualties, with India accusing Pakistan of supporting terrorists. In the aftermath, India have suspended the Indus Water Treaty and indicated potential retaliatory measures.Gavaskar pointed out on a news channel that the BCCI typically follows the Indian government's guidance, implying that current political tensions might prevent Pakistan's participation in the tournament.""I can't believe Sunny bhai said this,"" Miandad told Telecomasia.net, reflecting on their long-standing friendship. ""He's a respectful, down-to-earth person who always stayed away from politics.""Former spinner Iqbal Qasim expressed disbelief at Gavaskar 's comments. ""Gavaskar is a responsible figure loved on both sides of the border. Politics should not mix with sports,"" he stated.Basit Ali, however, used a harsher tone to express surprise. He criticised the remarks as ""stupid"" and called for evidence before making accusations. ""Let the investigation conclude. Cricket should remain above political hostilities,"" he added.

Mumbai weather prediction

Gujarat Titans (GT) and Mumbai Indians (MI) are set for a high-stakes IPL 2025 clash on Tuesday, with both teams eyeing playoff spots. Third-placed MI, riding a six-match winning streak and boasting the tournament's best Net Run Rate, need two wins from three remaining games to secure qualification. GT, in fourth place, also require two victories from their final four fixtures.The Titans' top order — B Sai Sudharsan (504 runs), Jos Buttler (470), and Shubman Gill (465) — has been key to their success. However, they'll be tested against MI’s formidable bowling attack led by Trent Boult (16 wickets), Jasprit Bumrah (11), and all-rounder Hardik Pandya (13 wickets, 157 runs). MI’s bowlers have not conceded over 200 runs in their last six games.While GT thrive batting first, they’ve also won all three of their chases convincingly. However, the lack of middle-order contributions, apart from Sherfane Rutherford (201), may be a concern.For MI, batters like Suryakumar Yadav (475), Ryan Rickelton (334), and Rohit Sharma (293) are peaking at the right time. GT’s bowlers, led by Prasidh Krishna (19 wickets), will need to deliver again, especially with Kagiso Rabada’s status still uncertain after a provisional suspension.The center of the square is with 63-meter boundaries on either side and 73 meters straight down the ground. There’s a good grass covering on the surface, but underneath, it’s quite dry with a slight bristle, suggesting the ball might grip and hold a touch early on. Retaining moisture has clearly been a challenge for the groundstaff. As the game progresses, the surface may slow down a bit, aiding spinners and slower bowlers. That said, chasing could be the better option, with conditions possibly improving under lights — though it’s a brave call in these humid conditions.Mumbai Indians predicted XI: Ryan Rickelton (wk), Rohit Sharma, Will Jacks, Suryakumar Yadav, Tilak Varma, Hardik Pandya (c), Naman Dhir, Corbin Bosch, Deepak Chahar, Trent Boult, Jasprit BumrahImpact Player – Karn SharmaGujarat Titans predicted XI: Sai Sudharsan, Shubman Gill (c), Jos Buttler (wk), Washington Sundar, Rahul Tewatia, Shahrukh Khan, Rashid Khan, Ravisrinivasan Sai Kishore, Gerald Coetzee, Mohammed Siraj, Prasidh KrishnaImpact Player - Ishant SharmaHardik Pandya (c), Rohit Sharma, Suryakumar Yadav, Robin Minz (wk), Ryan Rickelton (wk), Shrijith Krishnan (wk), Bevon Jacobs, Tilak Varma, Naman Dhir, Will Jacks, Mitchell Santner, Raj Angad Bawa, Raghu Sharma, Corbin Bosch, Trent Boult, Karn Sharma, Deepak Chahar, Ashwani Kumar, Reece Topley, VS Penmetsa, Arjun Tendulkar, Mujeeb Ur Rahman, Jasprit Bumrah.Shubman Gill (c), Jos Buttler (wk), Kumar Kushagra (wk), Anuj Rawat (wk), Sherfane Rutherford, Nishant Sidhu, Mahipal Lomror, Washington Sundar, Mohammed Arshad Khan, R Sai Kishore, Jayant Yadav, Karim Janat, B Sai Sudharsan, Dasun Shanaka, Shahrukh Khan, Mohammed Siraj, Prasidh Krishna, Manav Suthar, Gerald Coetzee, Gurnoor Singh Brar, Ishant Sharma, Kulwant Khejroliya, Rahul Tewatia, Rashid Khan.Played: 6MI wins: 2GT wins: 4Expect a mainly cloudy day in Mumbai with a couple of showers possible during the afternoon.

Heavy rain on Monday washed out the Indian Premier League match between Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) and Delhi Capitals (DC) at the Rajiv Gandhi Stadium. Both teams received one point apiece.With the match ending in a no result, Pat Cummins' SRH were knocked out of the playoffs race. The result also put DC's chances in limbo.Axar Patel's team's next three matches are against Punjab Kings (PBKS), Gujarat Titans (GT), and Mumbai Indians (MI). They will now have to win at least two of those matches to remain in contention for the playoffs.Earlier in the evening, after being sent in to bat, SRH restricted DC to a modest 133/7.Cummins struck in the first over, dismissing Karun Nair with the first delivery of the match. A well-pitched delivery in the corridor induced an edge to wicketkeeper Ishan Kishan, who was replacing Heinrich Klaasen behind the stumps.The SRH skipper claimed his second wicket when Faf du Plessis edged behind to Kishan after advancing down the track, leaving Delhi at 6/2 in 2.1 overs.Cummins completed his early assault by removing Abhishek Porel in his third over. A delivery that stopped on the pitch resulted in a leading edge that Kishan caught after running towards square leg.The fielding excellence continued as Cummins took a spectacular one-handed catch at mid-off to dismiss Axar Patel off Harshal Patel's bowling.Jaydev Unadkat added to Delhi's troubles by having Rahul Tewatia caught behind, marking a historic moment as all top four batsmen were dismissed caught by the wicketkeeper for the first time in IPL history.Delhi found themselves reeling at 29/5 in the eighth over before Tristan Stubbs and debutant Vipraj Nigam attempted to rebuild the innings.Their 33-run partnership ended in unusual circumstances when both batsmen ended up at the keeper's end, resulting in Vipraj's run-out.Impact Player Ashutosh Sharma , who replaced Porel, provided some resistance with an attacking innings. He hit two sixes off Zeeshan Ansari and continued his assault against Harshal Patel and Eshan Malinga.Ashutosh's quickfire 41 off 28 balls, along with Stubbs' contribution of 41 runs, helped Delhi recover from their early collapse to post 133/7 in their allocated 20 overs.Cummins finished with impressive figures of 3 for 19, while Unadkat provided good support with 1 for 13. The pitch offered assistance to the pace bowlers throughout the innings.","Heavy rain on Monday washed out the Indian Premier League match between Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) and Delhi Capitals (DC) Both teams received one point apiece.

IPL Points Table

The 55th match of the IPL 2025 season between Delhi Capitals and Sunrisers Hyderabad at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium ended in disappointment as persistent rain forced a washout. The no-result has significant playoff implications , Delhi Capitals remain alive in the race, while Sunrisers Hyderabad have been officially eliminated from contention.With the match abandoned, Delhi Capitals retained their fifth position on the points table. They now have six wins from 11 games and sit on 13 points with a Net Run Rate (NRR) of +0.362. The washout was a heavier blow for Sunrisers Hyderabad, who have moved to eighth position with just three wins from 11 matches and an NRR of -1.192, confirming their exit from playoff contention.At the top of the table, Royal Challengers Bangalore continue to lead the standings with eight wins and three losses, maintaining a strong NRR of +0.482. Punjab Kings , also with just three losses from 11 games, are breathing down RCB’s neck in second place. Their total of 15 points and NRR of +0.376 places them just behind the leaders. Mumbai Indians , currently third, have seven wins and four losses, giving them 14 points. However, they boast the best NRR in the competition at +1.274 — a potential tiebreaker advantage as the playoff battle intensifies.Quiz: Who's that IPL player? Gujarat Titans follow closely in fourth with 14 points from just 10 games and a solid NRR of +0.867, giving them a cushion and an extra match in hand over most contenders.Kolkata Knight Riders, on 11 points from 11 matches, remain in the hunt but need strong performances in their remaining fixtures to stay afloat.Lucknow Super Giants suffered a setback in their recent loss to Punjab, leaving them with 10 points from 11 matches and an unfavourable NRR of -0.469 — a possible stumbling block if the race goes down to net run rates.Meanwhile, Rajasthan Royals and Chennai Super Kings have both been knocked out of the playoffs race.

Young Mumbai batters Ayush Mhatre and Angkrish Raghuvanshi will have a base price of ₹5 lakhs in the T20 Mumbai League auction, which is scheduled to be held on Wednesday.Making a sensational debut for the Chennai Super Kings (CSK) in the Indian Premier League (IPL), Mhatre has amassed 164 runs in four innings with an impressive strike rate of 185.22. The 17-year-old played an excellent 94 off 48 balls against Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) at the Chinnaswamy Stadium in Bengaluru on Saturday.On the other hand, Kolkata Knight Riders ' (KKR) Angkrish Raghuvanshi has scored 285 runs in 10 outings so far in this year's IPL.Mhatre, Raghuvanshi, and all the players who have represented Mumbai in any format in the last three seasons have been categorized in the 'senior players' category and will command a base price of ₹5 lakhs, with an incremental bid of ₹25,000.Each team's 18-man squad must include four senior players.

Real Madrid secured a crucial 3-2 victory against Celta Vigo at the Santiago Bernabeu on Sunday, with Kylian Mbappe scoring twice to keep their La Liga title hopes alive. The win maintains their four-point gap behind leaders Barcelona ahead of next weekend's crucial El Clasico showdown.Real Madrid built a commanding three-goal lead before surviving a late comeback attempt from seventh-placed Celta Vigo, who are pursuing European qualification for next season.The hosts entered the match dealing with multiple defensive injuries but managed to overcome an early period of Celta pressure to take control of the proceedings.""The game seemed finished... you have to remember we're without six defenders and we're not always capable of solving these things,"" said Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti. ""Yes it could have been dealt with better, we suffered a bit, but it's a nice victory.""""We had a very good first half (but)... we fell apart, these things can't happen, it's happened to us a lot,"" Real Madrid midfielder Fede Valverde said on the club's television channel. ""We left a lot minutes for them to get comfortable and they are a great team and they put us in a tough spot.""Twenty-year-old Arda Guler , starting in place of the ill Rodrygo, demonstrated his potential early with an ambitious overhead kick that went wide.Celta created early chances as former Barcelona defender Marcos Alonso headed over and forced a save from Thibaut Courtois, while Aurelien Tchouameni missed a good heading opportunity for Madrid.Guler broke the deadlock after 33 minutes with a brilliant curling shot past Vicente Guaita after creating space in the box.Mbappe doubled Madrid's advantage in the 39th minute, finishing off a quick counterattack initiated by Courtois' save from Borja Iglesias, with Bellingham providing the assist.The French striker added his second goal just three minutes into the second half, converting a perfectly weighted pass from Guler for his 24th league goal of the season, putting him one behind Barcelona's Robert Lewandowski.Celta fought back as Javier Rodriguez scored from close range following a controversial corner decision.The introduction of Iago Aspas energised Celta's attack, and he provided an excellent assist for Williot Swedberg to score their second goal.Courtois had a nervous moment when Pablo Duran's shot nearly slipped from his grasp and crossed the line.""It's the game of the year for us, the last chance for us to win La Liga,"" said Valverde about the upcoming Clasico.In other La Liga action, Real Betis maintained pressure on Villarreal in the race for the fifth Champions League spot with a late 2-1 win at Espanyol, while Athletic Bilbao and Real Sociedad played out a goalless draw in their Basque derby.",Real Madrid beat Celta Vigo 3-2 at the Santiago Bernabeu on Sunday.

Bayern Munich were crowned German champions for the 34th time on Sunday, giving striker Harry Kane his first major trophy, after second-placed Bayer Leverkusen drew 2-2 at Freiburg.Bayern's 3-3 draw at RB Leipzig on Saturday, when the Bavarians came from two goals down to take the lead before conceding a stoppage-time equaliser, meant defending Bundesliga champions Leverkusen needed to win at Freiburg to delay the title party.Leverkusen were two goals down before scoring twice in the last 10 minutes.But Xabi Alonso's side could not find a third, as Bayern reclaimed the title at the first attempt after Leverkusen ended their 11-year reign last season.Alonso, who won three Bundesliga titles as a player with Bayern, congratulated his former club.""Congratulations to Bayern. It's a deserved championship. They were more consistent team over the season and they deserve the shield,"" Alonso said to DAZN.Kane, who had never previously won silverware, was among a group of Bayern players who gathered to watch the Leverkusen game in Munich on Sunday.The England captain was suspended for the match at Leipzig but will return this Saturday against Borussia Moenchengladbach at home, where Bayern will be presented with the Bundesliga shield at full-time.Given Bayern's far superior goal difference, Leverkusen's chances of defending their title were already all but impossible.Freiburg's Maximilian Eggestein hit a stunning goal from outside the box before half-time and Piero Hincapie was pressured into scoring an own goal just after the break.Florian Wirtz netted a spectacular solo goal with eight minutes remaining, carving through the middle of the field before firing the ball in off the post.Jonathan Tah headed Leverkusen level in stoppage time, but the visitors were unable to find the third goal which would have extended their spell as champions.The result left Leverkusen, who became the first team in history to win the title unbeaten last season, eight points behind Bayern with two games remaining.With the faint title hopes gone, Leverkusen's focus will turn to keeping hold of Alonso and Wirtz, who could both be headed for the exit in summer.Alonso has a contract at Leverkusen until 2026 but has been heavily linked with Real Madrid, where he spent five seasons as a player.Wirtz's deal expires in 2027 but the Germany midfielder is reportedly considering a big-money move to Bayern.Tah, who has already confirmed he will leave the club on a free transfer after a decade in Leverkusen, said his side had ""too little intensity, we had too few runs in behind. It didn't work today.""The Germany centre-back has been linked with moves to Barcelona and Bayern, but said ""we'll see"" where he plays next season.The late goal meant Leverkusen extended their unbeaten streak away from home to 33 games, equalling a Bundesliga record set by Bayern.The draw keeps Freiburg in fourth, one point clear of Borussia Dortmund, in the final Champions League spot. Freiburg have never played in Europe's top competition.Earlier on Sunday, Holstein Kiel won 3-1 at Augsburg, keeping their hopes of beating the drop alive.Kiel won thanks to a double from Alexander Bernhardsson and a Shuto Machino penalty and are now one point behind Heidenheim in the relegation play-off spot.In Sunday's late game, Eintracht Frankfurt can take a major step towards a top-four spot and Champions League qualification with a win at local rivals Mainz.",Bayern Munich crowned German champions for the 34th time on Sunday.

The British colonizers wanted Kolkata to be the London of the east, but in spirit, the Bengalis have always preferred Paris.From the musicality of the two languages to the celebration of avant-garde art, the cities do share a bond. When Satyajit Ray won the Légion d'honneur — the highest French national order of merit — in 1987, the standard feeling in Kolkata was: “We’ll always have Paris.”The cultural connect is on the wane. But now, there’s a football parallel between the cities as Paris FC won their promotion into the top tier of French football — Ligue 1 .Parc des Princes, home to Paris St-Germain, is merely 193m away from the new Paris FC ground, and the fans have already started calling it “the closest derby in the world .”But then, Kolkata isn’t too far away. The East Bengal and Mohun Bagan grounds, located in the Maidan area, are just 800m apart. But if you take a shortcut, it is merely a five-minute walk.The two giants don’t play the derby — when it involves senior men’s football — at their own grounds anymore. They prefer the Salt Lake Stadium — a la San Siro in Milan — because of security issues. The fact that Salt Lake Stadium can accommodate up to one lakh fans makes it financially viable for the clubs as well.But there was a time when the two teams played at each other’s grounds. There was, of course, the ‘neutral’ Eden Gardens, designated venue of the ‘big match’, but cricket always took precedence there.The famous 1975 IFA Shield final, where East Bengal beat Mohun Bagan 5-0 — the biggest margin recorded between the two teams till date — was played at the Bagan ground.The hero of that afternoon, the late Subhas Bhowmick, would often recall how difficult it was to return to their home tent on that afternoon, with thousands of fans making it an occasion to remember.Till the late 1980s, the two teams did play at each other’s homes on and off, especially in the Calcutta Football League.The hockey derby was played at East Bengal and Mohun Bagan grounds, but that’s also a thing of the past.Memories of the Maidan derby linger, and when PSG and Paris FC take the field for the “closest derby,” the old Maidan regular will take a trip down memory lane — once upon a time, it was ours.","The two giants don’t play the derby — when it involves senior men’s football — at their own grounds anymore.

Barcelona strengthened their grip on the La Liga title by securing a 2-1 comeback victory against already-relegated Real Valladolid on Saturday, extending their lead to seven points over Real Madrid. The win came despite heavy rotation from coach Hansi Flick , who prioritised Tuesday's Champions League semi-final against Inter Milan, with Raphinha and Fermin Lopez scoring second-half goals to overturn Ivan Sanchez's early opener.Barcelona made nine changes to their starting lineup from Wednesday's 3-3 Champions League draw with Inter Milan, with only Pedri and Gerard Martin retained.Marc-Andre ter Stegen returned to the Barcelona goal for his first appearance since September after recovering from injury.""He showed how good he is, how he can perform and it's good to see that,"" said Flick, who confirmed Wojciech Szczesny would return for the Inter match and next weekend's Clasico against Real Madrid.""I was really looking forward to playing this game and it's always better with a win for the team,"" Ter Stegen told DAZN.The hosts took an early lead when Martin's shot deflected off Ronald Araujo and looped past Ter Stegen after just six minutes.Valladolid fans expressed their displeasure with majority owner and president Ronaldo by throwing fake banknotes bearing his face and chanting for his departure.The first half saw chances for both sides, with Valladolid keeper Andre Ferreira denying Pau Victor and Ansu Fati, while Ter Stegen made an important save from Raul Moro.Barcelona debutant Dani Rodriguez was forced off with a shoulder injury, leading to the introduction of 17-year-old Lamine Yamal , who had impressed against Inter midweek.Yamal contributed to Barcelona's equalizer, with his cross being parried by Ferreira before Raphinha collected the loose ball to score his 16th league goal of the season.Lopez then secured the victory by converting Martin's cross from inside the area, with Araujo making a crucial late intervention to preserve the win.""When you make nine changes in the line-up, it's not easy for these guys who came in,"" Flick said. ""In the end I'm satisfied with three more points and we gave some players less minutes, and this is good for me.""In other La Liga action, Atletico Madrid played out a goalless draw at struggling Alaves, maintaining their hold on third place with Champions League qualification virtually secured.Alaves moved to 16th position, three points clear of the relegation zone following the valuable point against Atletico.The match saw few clear opportunities, with Atletico's first shot on target coming from Lino with 20 minutes remaining, while Jan Oblak made an impressive save to deny Kike Garcia.""Neither side could get the upper hand... the game was played in the middle of the pitch without any danger,"" said Atletico coach Diego Simeone.Villarreal strengthened their Champions League qualification hopes with a 4-2 victory over Osasuna, featuring two goals from Ayoze Perez.The win put Villarreal in fifth place, four points ahead of Real Betis, who face Espanyol on Sunday.",Barcelona beat Real Valladolid 2-1 to extend La Liga lead to seven points.

Arsenal faced a setback before their Champions League clash with Paris Saint-Germain as Bournemouth secured their first-ever away victory against them with a 2-1 win, while Aston Villa strengthened their top five aspirations by defeating Fulham 1-0 on Saturday, May 4, 2025, in London.Arsenal initially took control when Declan Rice scored in the first half during his 100th appearance for the club.The lead was short-lived as Dean Huijsen equalised, followed by Evanilson's winning goal for Bournemouth.The defeat comes at a crucial time for Arsenal, who are already trailing 1-0 to PSG in their Champions League semi-final first leg and face the return leg in Paris on Wednesday.Arsenal, currently in second place, need six more points to secure Champions League qualification through a top-five Premier League finish.The London club has finished as runners-up to Manchester City in the previous two seasons and now sees the Champions League as their only remaining chance for silverware this term.Arsenal's last Champions League final appearance was in 2006, and they have never won the competition.""We should have put the game to bed. We defended really poorly, nowhere near the standards that we are used to. We wanted to generate the momentum and a really positive vibe today and we haven't. What we have created is frustration, rage and anger. Make sure we use that on Wednesday,"" said Arteta.At Villa Park, Unai Emery's team continued their impressive home form as Youri Tielemans' header in the 12th minute secured victory against Fulham.Villa, now in seventh place, extended their unbeaten home streak to 20 games across all competitions, drawing level on 60 points with sixth-placed Nottingham Forest and fifth-placed Chelsea.""If we weren't winning today, forget it completely. Today, we got more or less to be close to Europe. Wow, fantastic, brilliant. The best gift we can achieve after it is the Europa League or Champions League. We will fight for it, Europe, and hopefully we can fight for the Champions League,"" said Emery.In other matches, Southampton 's struggles continued as they lost 2-0 to Leicester at the King Power Stadium, risking equaling Derby's record-low Premier League points total.Jamie Vardy, who recently announced his departure from Leicester, scored his 199th goal for the club in the 17th minute.The match saw an unusual delay when referee David Webb suffered a head injury after colliding with Leicester's Jordan Ayew, with Vardy playfully blowing the referee's whistle during the treatment break.Ayew later scored Leicester's second goal before halftime, securing their first victory since January.Southampton, having lost 28 of 35 league games, have three matches remaining to avoid sharing Derby's record-low 11-point total from 2007-08.In the day's other fixture, relegated Ipswich showed resilience by coming back from two goals down to draw 2-2 with Everton.Everton had taken a commanding lead through Beto and Dwight McNeil's goals, but Julio Enciso's long-range strike and George Hirst's late equaliser secured a point for Ipswich.The match marked Everton's penultimate game at Goodison Park, with their final match at the historic venue scheduled against Southampton on May 18 before moving to their new Bramley-Moore Dock stadium next season.","Bournemouth secure their first-ever away victory against Arsenal with a 2-1 win.

Bhubaneswar: It was a fairytale end to coach Manolo Marquez’s tenure at FC Goa as his men bid him adieu with the perfect parting gift by clinching the Kalinga Super Cup with a dominant 3-0 win over Jamshedpur FC here on Saturday.And their happy ending with the Spanish coach also scripted a new beginning as they claimed an AFC ACL2 spot – their second continental sojourn, having qualified for the AFC Champions League with their ISL Shield win in 2010-21.While the trophy presentation was conducted indoors after a sudden cyclonic storm and rains affected a proper ceremony in front of its supporters, it could not dampen FC Goa’s celebrations following their brilliant performance at Kalinga Stadium.Wearing black armbands in tribute to the victims of Lairai Devi Temple in Goa, the Gaurs took the wind away from under Jamshedpur players’ feet as Borja Herrera, who was adjudged the player of the match, scored a brace (23’, 51’) followed by another strike from Dejan Drazic (72’) earned them their first trophy since the 2021 Durand Cup.As for Khalid Jamil and his Red Miners, it was heartbreak for them as they conceded three goals and a defeat having not conceded a single of them in this edition before the final.It was a speedy start to the match with both teams pressing high from the word-go and trying to build the momentum for that all-important breakthrough.For Jamshedpur, Rei Tachikawa went for a long shot in the first minute itself and captain Javi Hernandez then darted into the box from the left for a shot that was well saved by young Goa custodian Hrithik Tiwari in the second minute.Goa, however, began growing into the game soon after with Herrera and Aakash Sangwan looking to control the game from the left and right flanks respectively.And Marquez and his men did not have to wait long for the opener as a brilliant through from the middle by Drazic reached Sangwan on the left wing while deceiving Ashutosh Mehta outside the box. The youngster shot the ball low to the left of Albino Gomes, who had no option but to parry it near an onrushing Herrera, who shot the rebound only for Stephen Eze to block. However, there was no stopping the Spaniard on the second rebound as he made no mistake in shooting it higher and into the left of the goal.The breakthrough only made Goa more dominant even as Jamshedpur tried their best to get back into the game.Their best chance of the half came in the 43rd minute from a corner kick that almost hit the outstretched hand of Sandesh Jhingan in front of the goal Instead, Lazar Cirkovic’s header hit the woodwork.All plans and strategies that Jamil might have discussed during the break came to naught soon after the change of end as Gomes, who had kept three clean sheets in the tournament so far, was beaten by a screamer out of nowhere from Herrera, who had made a run from the midfield.It was Herrera’s fourth goal of the Super Cup as he levelled with teammate Iker Guarrotxena as the topscorer while taking the match away from Jamshedpur.However, to the further disappointment of the Red Miners fans, who had long been their No. 12 of the final with their cheers, it was Drazic who sealed the match and the trophy for his team by receiving a long through from Carl McHugh and going around Gomes to confidently put the ball into the net and the Red Miners’ dreams of a trophy into dust.","FC Goa clinch Kalinga Super Cup with 3-0 win over Jamshedpur FC.

Oliver Rowland on his winning strategy

Oliver Rowland showed who’s the boss on the first day of the Monaco E-Prix . The Nissan driver went on to win the Round 6 on Saturday, registering his third win of the 2024–25 Formula E World Championship . The 32-year-old hinted that they would have been enjoying the champagne after the sweet victory but since this is a double header, the party will have to wait till Sunday. The Round 7 of the Miami E-Prix is scheduled on Sunday.Talking about his quick strategy that resulted in a win for him, Oliver Rowland said, “You never know what to do with the strategy especially with these Pit Boost races - it’s the second race but we kind of had a plan and we stuck to it. It was a bit trickier to pass Taylor [Barnard] to be honest, but we kept calm - even at the end I was pretty worried during that second Attack Mode: I dropped back to fifth and I was behind two Mahindra's, and I was like ‘right now we need to get cracking’, but great job by the team and very well executed.”The 32-year-old added, “I was thinking Taylor was pushing the barriers of the rules at some points, but fair play to him - in the end we got the job done so it doesn’t really matter. We’ve started the season really well, but it feels a bit different now. Normally you’d be looking forward to the champagne but you’ve already got one eye on tomorrow.”A key factor in Rowland's success was the strategic deployment of Pit Boost by Nissan, allowing him to overtake polesitter NEOM McLaren driver Taylor Barnard on Lap 13. Despite briefly losing the lead to Mahindra Racing’s Nyck de Vries on Lap 26, Rowland masterfully utilised his final Attack Mode on Lap 27 to reclaim the lead, ultimately winning the race by a comfortable two-second margin.Also Read: Monaco E-Prix Round 6: Oliver Rowland wins, Nyck de Vries second, Jake Dennis secures third spot on podium despite penalty Rowland is currently on top of the FIA Drivers' World Championship standings with 94 points.

NEW DELHI: The Jukskei Derby between the Joburg Super Kings (JSK) and the Pretoria Capitals (PC) at the Wanderers Stadium was abandoned due to heavy rain.Prior to the downpour, the Joburg Super Kings' spin trio of Moeen Ali Imran Tahir , and Donovan Ferreira proved to be a formidable force.The Super Kings made a strategic decision to rest Proteas spinner Tabraiz Shamsi and instead handed Moeen Ali his first match of Season 3.Ali partnered with the experienced Imran Tahir and the promising Donovan Ferreira.Ferreira, who opened the bowling in the Powerplay, struck early by dismissing the dangerous Rahmanullah Gurbaz, caught by Tahir at point. Moeen Ali, introduced after the Powerplay, also made an immediate impact by clean bowling Capitals captain Rilee Rossouw.With Will Jacks already back in the pavilion, the Super Kings took control at 52/3. Kyle Verreynne (39 off 31 balls) and Liam Livingstone (22 off 30 balls) attempted a fightback, but Jimmy Neesham's 30 off 21 balls was the only significant contribution as the Super Kings' spin trio maintained a tight grip.Moeen Ali finished with impressive figures of 2/21 from his four overs, while Ferreira claimed 2/17 from three overs. Tahir was economical, conceding only 17 runs from his spell.The Super Kings' captain, Faf du Plessis , displayed astute tactical awareness in managing his spin bowlers and their introduction into the attack, which played a crucial role in restricting the Capitals to 138/8 before the rain intervened.Both teams secured two points each, with JSK moving to the top of the log with 10 points, while the Capitals are joint second with MI Cape Town on nine points.","The Jukskei Derby between the Joburg Super Kings (JSK) and the Pretoria Capitals (PC) at the Wanderers Stadium was abandoned due to heavy rain.

The Indian cricket team is set to receive an addition to the support staff as the Board of Control for Cricket in India ( BCCI ) has decided to add Sitanshu Kotak , currently the India A head coach, as the batting coach. Kotak will join head coach Gautam Gambhir from the home series versus England which features five T20Is and three ODIs.It is understood that Gambhir had asked for a batting coach during the BCCI review meet following the Border-Gavaskar Trophy and the Indian cricket board has agreed to the request.Kotak has been part of the India A set-up and National Cricket Academy (NCA) for a very long time.""Coach Gambhir had asked for a batting coach during the review meeting. Discussions were ongoing since then and now Kotak will be added to the support staff,"" said a senior BCCI official who was part of the meeting which also featured captain Rohit Sharma Considering how the batters have struggled in the last two Test series, the Indian cricket board also felt the need to have a full time batting coach.""Most of our batsmen [batters], including the seniors, have struggled badly in the last two series. There's clearly a need to strengthen the support staff of the Indian men's cricket team from the batting point of view,"" says a reliable source in the BCCI.Kotak was the India A head coach during the tour of Australia in November last year, and the head coach of the Jasprit Bumrah-captained Indian team which toured Ireland in August 2023.The 52-year-old former left-hander, who captained Saurashtra, was a colossus in domestic cricket. He played from the 1992-93 season to 2013 and scored 8061 runs in 130 first-class matches at an average of 41.76, with 15 hundreds and 55 fifties.Post retirement, the seasoned cricketer has entered full-time coaching and after coaching Saurashtra, became a batting coach at the NCA in Bengaluru. For the last four years, he has been regularly appointed by the BCCI as the India A head coach, as the side went on tours to Bangladesh, South Africa and Australia. He was also the assistant coach of the now defunct Gujarat Lions in IPL 2017.Currently, India's coaching staff, consisting of Morne Morkel (bowling coach), Abhishek Nayar (assistant coach), Ryan ten Doeschate (assistant coach) and T Dilip (fielding coach), besides the head coach Gautam Gambhir, doesn’t have a batting coach, though Nayar's role is focused on working with the batters.After India were blanked 3-0 at home by New Zealand and lost 3-1 in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy in Australia, the role of the support staff of the team has come under heavy scrutiny, particularly with players like Virat Kohli, skipper Rohit Sharma and Shubman Gill failing to shrug off their poor form.",India cricket team set to receive an addition to the support staff.

NEW DELHI: Fakhar Zaman 's scintillating knock of 67 runs off 52 deliveries on Thursday propelled the Desert Vipers to a five-wicket victory over the MI Emirates in a thrilling encounter at the Dubai International Stadium .Zaman's innings, coupled with Alex Hales 's 34 and Sam Curran 's crucial 28, proved pivotal in chasing down the target of 160 within 19.1 overs.After electing to bat first, the MI Emirates got off to a promising start, but faltered in the middle overs.However, a late flourish from Kieron Pollard (36 off 23) and Romario Shepherd 's blistering 16 off 6 balls helped them post a competitive total of 159/6.In response, the Desert Vipers' openers, Hales and Zaman, provided a solid foundation with a 51-run partnership. Despite losing a few wickets, Zaman remained steadfast, striking four sixes and three fours en route to his half-century. His 65-run stand with Curran shifted the momentum in the Vipers' favour.Although Zaman fell in the 17th over, Sherfane Rutherford's cameo of 21 off 8 balls sealed the victory for the Desert Vipers.Also See: ICC Champions Trophy 2025 In the post-match presentation, Fakhar Zaman, the Player of the Match, acknowledged the challenges posed by the spinners and credited his team's strategy of playing out their overs and taking the game deep.“I think the fast bowlers were easy, but we were struggling against spinners. We just planned to play out their overs and take the game deep. It was because of the way the bowlers were bowling and the leg-side boundary was big, so I was looking for runs on the shorter boundary,” said Fakhar as the Vipers maintained the winning streak after their third consecutive victory in the season.MI Emirates skipper Nicholas Pooran expressed satisfaction with their total of 160, considering the tricky nature of the pitch.Also See: Champions Trophy Schedule 2025 ""I felt we were in the game; we were happy with 160, the way the pitch was playing, it seemed to be very tricky.

NEW DELHI: Left-arm spinner Tilly Corteen-Coleman stated that England wants to enjoy playing top-tier competitive cricket in the run-up to the 2025 U19 Women's T20 World Cup.In 2023, England lost to India in the final in Potchefstroom, South Africa, and ended as runners-up.""As a team, I think we are looking to have loads of fun out there, but playing high-quality and competitive cricket is what we are really going out there for.We have a bit of a team motto: 'evolve, embrace, enjoy' - evolve ourselves, embrace the challenge, and enjoy ourselves. All of our cricket will be playing with those values in mind.""We are going to be doing our very best to win. I was in school at the time of the last one (U19 Women's T20 World Cup), I couldn't watch all of it. I followed as much as I could. I knew a lot of the players in the team, so I was rooting for them. It's a shame they didn't get over the line but they played some really exciting cricket,"" Tilly was quoted as saying by ICC.Before becoming the youngest player and youngest wicket-taker in the history of The Hundred women's competition, Tilly made her debut in 2024 when she took four wickets in four balls for South East Stars in the Charlotte Edwards Cup. Growing up near Kent's home ground in Canterbury, Tilly was persuaded to play cricket by his older brother Hugo.Tilly progressed through the ranks at Kent, learning a lot about the game from Laura Marsh, Lydia Greenway, Charlotte Edwards, and Tammy Beaumont after deciding to move from seam bowling to spin on the recommendation of her under-11s coach, David Sear.""I started at my local club, St Lawrence and Highland Court, when I was six. I really started because I wanted to copy my brother. We are really competitive and I couldn't bear the thought that he might be better than me at something.""From a young age, I knew it was what I wanted to do. I remember going to junior school and we had a careers day where we had to come to school dressed as what you want to be when you're older. I went dressed as a cricketer. So, I always knew what I was going to do,"" she said.Tilly's cricket career took a drastic turn in 2024 when she was called up late for the South East Stars' preseason tour of Abu Dhabi. ""I had absolutely no idea. I'm so lucky and grateful for the opportunities I had last season. I hadn't even played a match for South East Stars when I was called up to the pre-season tour.""I then went to Sri Lanka and was lucky to be part of the travelling squad with the England U19s, which was amazing. That is when I got the call from Lottie (Charlotte Edwards) about being drafted by Southern Brave. It all went very quickly from there. A couple of weeks later I got the call from Surrey (South East Stars at the time) offering me a pay-as-you-play contract. That was pretty incredible.""Tilly's maiden wicket in The Hundred was of former Australian captain Meg Lanning , something she never would have imagined in her wildest fantasies, following her stunning performance of taking four wickets in four deliveries against the Northern Diamonds.""I can't lie, I hadn't even realised I was on a hat-trick or four in four. It was only because it was the last wicket of the game that I was celebrating on the pitch with the team. They told me to look at the big screen and that is when I saw it. It was pretty unexpected and an incredible day.""The Hundred was so special and I'm so grateful for the opportunity given to me by Lottie, and to work with such an incredible group of players and coaches. To play on such a huge stage and have such amazing support from the crowd is everything I'd wanted and more. To have Meg Lanning as your first wicket, and caught and bowled, it's even better.""It was such a whirlwind, the Hundred and my first wicket. I wouldn't have wanted to do it with anyone else. I knew a couple of them, but not many, but they were such a great group of girls but to go straight in and play in every game, with Lottie showing such faith in me, so it was an amazing experience all-round,"" she concluded.",Tilly Corteen-Coleman is the youngest player and youngest wicket-taker in The Hundred women's competition.

We've got a very solid team in terms of bowlers, batsmen and Alex Carey behind the stumps, so I'm not looking too far ahead; it's each series at a time.""But I'm also mindful that nothing lasts forever; at some stage there's going to have to be a time to leave the game, and I respect that. There's going to have to be the next players to come up, and I'm very mindful of that too.

Either whenever that time is when I pull the pin or I feel like it's time to look at the next goal whenever that may be (I'll do that). I don't feel like it's right now, but I'm very open to that.

Barcelona advanced to the quarter-finals of the Copa del Rey with a resounding 5-1 victory over Real Betis on Wednesday. The star of the show was 17-year-old Lamine Yamal , who put on a dazzling display at the Olympic Stadium.Gavi opened the scoring for Barcelona early in the match, and the Catalans continued to dominate with goals from Jules Kounde, Raphinha, Ferran Torres, and Yamal himself. The young winger's performance was particularly impressive, as he scored and helped create two more goals.Barcelona's confidence was high coming into the match, having recently won the Spanish Super Cup in Saudi Arabia by thrashing Real Madrid. Despite resting key players like Robert Lewandowski, the team's attacking prowess was on full display.Pau Cubarsi, a 17-year-old defender who came through Barcelona's youth academy alongside Yamal, praised his teammate's performance.""I've been enjoying watching him for many years, now the whole world is, and he deserves it all.""Barcelona's dominance was evident from the start, with Dani Olmo, who recently obtained a temporary playing license, starting as a false nine in place of Lewandowski. Olmo was involved in the opening goal and had several chances of his own, hitting the post and firing over.Kounde scored Barcelona's second goal after a sublime pass from Yamal, exploiting the right side of Betis' defense. Although Kounde had a second goal disallowed for a marginal offside, Barcelona continued to create chances.In the second half, Yamal had a goal of his own disallowed for an offside in the build-up, but it didn't matter as Raphinha scored minutes later after another surging run from the young winger. Ferran Torres added a fourth goal, and Yamal finally got on the scoresheet himself with a near-post finish.Betis managed to pull one back from the penalty spot through Vitor Roque, who is on loan from Barcelona, after Kounde fouled Jesus Rodriguez in the area.After the game, Gavi praised Yamal as the best player in the world after Lionel Messi, and coach Hansi Flick also commended the winger's talent.""Gavi's very emotional, so I say also yes (he's the best),"" joked Flick.""You can see it, in great matches you see big talent and he showed it many many times, he's on a good (path).""Yamal, who shone for Spain during their Euro 2024 victory last summer, has an impressive tally of nine goals and 13 assists across all competitions for Barcelona this season.In other Copa del Rey action, Atletico Madrid joined Barcelona in the last eight with a comfortable 4-0 win over second division Elche. This marked Atletico's 15th consecutive victory across all competitions.Atletico coach Diego Simeone rested some of his regular starters, but the team still managed to secure a commanding win. Alexander Sorloth scored twice in the first half, and Elche's chances of a comeback were further diminished when Nico Fernandez was sent off early in the second half.Rodrigo Riquelme and Julian Alvarez added to Atletico's lead, sealing an emphatic victory for the Rojiblancos.The Copa del Rey action continues on Thursday, with defending league champions Real Madrid hosting Celta Vigo and cup holders Athletic Bilbao welcoming Osasuna.","Barcelona defeated Real Betis 5-1 in the Copa del Rey on Wednesday.

London: Arsenal reignited their Premier League title challenge with a 2-1 victory over Tottenham on Wednesday, while Newcastle secured a spot in the top four thanks to a brace from Alexander Isak.In other matches, David Moyes had a disappointing return to the Everton dugout as his team lost 1-0 to Aston Villa at Goodison Park.The win at the Emirates lifts Arsenal to within four points of league leaders Liverpool, who drew 1-1 with Nottingham Forest on Tuesday, and ended a three-match winless run for the Gunners across all competitions.Tottenham took the lead through Son Heung-min in the 25th minute, but Arsenal equalised 15 minutes later when Gabriel's header from a corner deflected off Dominic Solanke for an own goal.Arsenal completed the turnaround just before halftime, with Leandro Trossard blasting a shot past new Spurs goalkeeper Antonin Kinsky.Despite numerous chances to extend their lead, Arsenal failed to do so and had a nervous moment when Pedro Porro hit the post in stoppage time.Arsenal now sits on 43 points after 21 matches, four points behind Liverpool, who have a game in hand.Mikel Arteta, the Arsenal manager, praised his team's performance, calling it ""outstanding.""""We had some big chances and big situations. At the end we had to suffer more than we wanted,"" he told the BBC.""When you have opportunities (to close the gap) you have to take them. We are on a really consistent run in the Premier League. It's about recovery tomorrow and Aston Villa on Saturday, going and going.""The defeat is another setback for injury-plagued Tottenham, who have taken only five points from their last nine Premier League games and have fallen to 13th in the table.Tottenham manager Ange Postecoglou was critical of his team's performance, saying, ""Nowhere near good enough, especially in the first half. We were too passive.""Newcastle moved into fourth place, ahead of struggling Chelsea, with a 3-0 victory over Wolves, thanks to a record-chasing performance from Isak, who scored for the eighth consecutive league match.Isak's deflected shot off Wolves defender Rayan Ait-Nouri put Newcastle ahead in the 34th minute, and he doubled the lead before the hour mark with his 15th league goal of the season.Anthony Gordon added a third goal for Newcastle.""I feel amazing,"" said Isak, who has Jamie Vardy's record of scoring in 11 straight Premier League games in his sights.""Individually I feel free and confident but looking at the team we are doing so well as well, defending and with threats going forward. It is a team and I have to keep contributing with goals.""At Goodison Park, Ollie Watkins scored the only goal for Aston Villa in the 51st minute, slotting past England teammate Jordan Pickford after being sent through by Morgan Rogers.Despite their efforts, Everton lacked creativity, which is unsurprising for a team that has scored only 15 league goals in 20 matches this season.The result lifts Aston Villa to seventh in the table, while Everton remain in deep trouble, just one point above the relegation zone in 16th place.Everton, who have been in the top flight since 1954, have struggled against relegation for the past three seasons and are once again in a perilous position.David Moyes, who enjoyed success during his 11-year stint at Goodison Park from 2002 to 2013, was brought back by Everton's new American owners, the Friedkin Group, after they sacked Sean Dyche last week.""Obviously it's been a bit of a whirlwind,"" Moyes said. ""Sean Dyche left a group of players that have great character and a great attitude.""I'm really pleased to take over that. What I need to do is add quality and find a way of getting results but you can't change the whole thing around straight away.""In another match, Leicester suffered their sixth consecutive league defeat, losing 2-0 to Crystal Palace, which leaves them second from bottom in the table.Jean-Philippe Mateta scored for Palace early in the second half, and Marc Guehi secured the points with a late second goal.","Arsenal beat Tottenham Hotspur 2-1 to move within four points of Premier League leaders Liverpool.

NEW DELHI: As they say, there is no dull day in Indian football. The latest drama is taking place at Mohammedan SC . Reports emerged on Tuesday from Kolkata's Vivekananda Yuba Bharati Krirangan claiming that Mohammedan players boycotted training ahead of their Indian Super League ( ISL ) home game against Chennaiyin FC , scheduled for January 15. The players were allegedly protesting against three-month unpaid wages.It was further suggested that while the club management had committed to clearing the dues by January 15, players reportedly decided to abstain from training due to a lack of concrete steps from the administration.This news surfaced amid Mohammedan’s resurgence in the ISL, riding on a three-match unbeaten streak. As the team stands second-last on the table, with Hyderabad FC below them, coach Andrey Chernyshov has been working tirelessly to turn their season around.Amid the cub's resurrection, the report of players boycotting training sessions over unpaid dues has raised eyebrows. However, Mohammedan SC have dismissed the rumours.In an exclusive interview with TimesofIndia.com, Mohammedan SC General Secretary Ishtiaque Ahmed, famously known as Raju around the Maidan region, categorically refuted the claims.""The reports that have come out are all fake and baseless, and they are being fabricated and posted on Facebook. There is no such issue as players not receiving their payments; all players are being paid. If players were not being paid, how would we be signing new players?"" said Ahmed.Despite challenges on the pitch, the Kolkata-based club has been actively reinforcing their squad in recent times. During the current transfer window, MDSC have secured several promising talents, including domestic standouts like Manvir Singh, Mahitosh Roy, Santosh Trophy winner Robi Hansda, and Juwel Ahmed Mazumder.Additionally, foreign signings such as Florent Ogier and Marc Andre Schmerböck have also been added to their ranks. TimesofIndia.com understands that the club is still in pursuit of another striker before the window shuts.Ahmed further clarified the status of training sessions: ""Training is ongoing, and it is happening as usual. All the players are attending the training sessions.""However, addressing the speculation about finances, Ahmed explained recent changes in the club’s payment structure: ""Our payment structure has been changed. Previously, we used to make advance payments to the players before the month ended. But now, we need results. It’s not feasible that the investors keep making payments without getting results in return.""The shift in approach extends to the incentive system as well. Ahmed elaborated, ""By structure, we mean the incentive system we had. Previously, we provided incentives to all the players. Now, it has been decided that only players who perform well will receive incentives. The players have also been informed that if they do not perform well, their incentives will be cut.""Not all squad members have been actively participating in the ISL, with some sidelined due to injuries or suspensions. This has naturally influenced the club’s approach toward incentive payments.""Last month, advance payments were not made, but the payments for the previous month have been cleared this month. Previously, we used to make advance payments, but now that is no longer happening.""Perhaps the decision to pay players at the end of the month might serve as a motivating factor to inspire better performance, believes the club secretary.On the other hand, refuting the rumours about players boycotting training, Ahmed clarified, ""All the players are attending training. The reports that are circulating are speculating that players didn’t show up due to financial reasons, but that’s not true. Some players were given rest, and some were dealing with injuries, which is why the coach didn’t include them in practice sessions.""Ahmed also confirmed that there were no hidden financial issues grappling the club: ""There are no financial difficulties. If there were any, we would definitely address them openly. Why wouldn’t we say it?""",Mohammedan SC deny reports of players boycotting training over unpaid wages. Club secretary Ishtiaque Ahmed says all players are being paid. Mohammedan are currently second-last in the Indian Super League ( ISL) They face Chennaiyin FC in their next match on January 15.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117262167,imgsize-84278,width-400,resizemode-4/117262167.jpg"

KOLKATA: Describing them as a casualty of continuous poor refereeing calls and highlighting a “step-motherly treatment” in the Indian Super League , East Bengal club has decided to take their grievance to the doorstep of Union sports minister.The club is understood to have sent a missive to Mansukh L Mandaviya on Tuesday night, seeking intervention from him for Indian football ’s sorry state of affairs.East Bengal’s move came close on the heels of their latest loss to Mohun Bagan SG in the ISL during which the club claimed that referee Venkatest R ignored “a genuine” penalty call and gave an “unnecessary” booking to midfielder Souvik Chakrabarti, who had eventually received a marching order.“Throughout the last 10-12 years we had to bear the brunt of biased refereeing, be it in the ILeague or more so in the ISL,” club secretary Rupak Saha said in a statement.“The step-motherly treatment in ISL has made us wonder whether the ISL is still being run in the spirit of one-city-one-club with which it was envisaged originally,” he further noted.Meanwhile, the AIFF chief refereeing officer Trevor Kettle has backed Venkatesh’s decision, saying East Bengal were not denied a penalty in the derby in Guwahati, which Mohun Bagan SG won 1-0, their ninth win in 10 meetings against the city rivals in ISL.“These people (like Kettle) have made Indian football a laughing stock and forced us to reach the minister’s office for his intervention,” senior East Bengal official Debabrata Sarkar said.",East Bengal have taken their grievance to the doorstep of Union sports minister.

Liverpool 's charge towards the Premier League title was halted by stubborn Nottingham Forest in a 1-1 draw between the top two on Tuesday as Manchester City 's resurgence came undone in a 2-2 draw at Brentford.Chris Wood fired Forest in front early on at a raucous City Ground, but Liverpool dominated almost the entire 97 minutes and got back on level terms thanks to substitute Diogo Jota's goal with his first touch.Only a brilliant goalkeeping performance from Matz Sels denied the leaders victory, but the point maintained a six-point cushion over Forest for Arne Slot's men, who also have a game in hand.Forest had won their last seven games in all competitions to raise the possibility of matching Leicester's incredible title win of 2015/16.The in-form Wood had the home fans believing after just eight minutes when he slotted in Anthony Elanga's pass.Liverpool enjoyed over 70 percent possession and had 23 shots on goal but only posed a serious threat in front of goal after the break.Jota had only been on the field a matter of seconds when he nodded in Kostas Tsimikas' corner.Sels then made incredible saves to deny Jota, Mohamed Salah and Cody Gakpo a winner, while Salah also had a goalbound effort cleared off the line.""I could not have asked for more,"" said Slot. ""Second half was outstanding.""There are not many teams that can create so many chances against an opponent so defensively strong. Unfortunately we couldn't get a second.""Liverpool's second consecutive league draw opens the door for Arsenal to cut the gap at the top to four points when they host Tottenham in the north London derby on Wednesday.Any suggestion City could get themselves back in the title race was ended in a late collapse in west London as Brentford struck twice in the final 10 minutes for a deserved point.Phil Foden's double had City on course for a fourth consecutive win after a run of just one victory in 13 games.However, the English champions' defending was not convincing all night and they were punished as Yoane Wissa and Christian Norgaard netted for the Bees.Foden's return to the form that saw him crowned Premier League player of the year last season was the one positive for City.But Pep Guardiola will reflect on a missed opportunity to make up ground on the top four as City remain down in sixth, 12 points off the top.Foden produced a brilliant deft touch from Kevin De Bruyne's inviting delivery and then smashed in a rebound for his fourth goal in five league games.Brentford wasted a host of chances before conceding but finally got some reward for their attacking endeavour when Wissa slotted in from Mads Roerslev's cross to become the club's all-time leading goalscorer in the Premier League.They completed the comeback in stoppage time when Norgaard's header had too much power for Stefan Ortega.""We are not (at our best) and we didn't take the right decisions,"" said Guardiola. ""It's fine, it's not a good place to come. Unfortunately, we couldn't win.""Fourth-placed Chelsea's miserable run extended to five league games without a win but they were grateful for captain Reece James' stoppage-time equaliser salvaging a point in a 2-2 draw at home to Bournemouth.Cole Palmer's cool finish from Nicolas Jackson's through ball had given Chelsea the perfect start.But Bournemouth hit back through Justin Kluivert's penalty, before Antoine Semenyo's blistering near-post effort put the visitors in front.James has endured another injury-hit season but showed his quality by curling home a free-kick at the death.West Ham boss Graham Potter enjoyed a winning home debut as Fulham were beaten 3-2 at the London Stadium.Carlos Soler, Tomas Soucek and Lucas Paqueta were on target for the Hammers to take Potter's men above Manchester United and Tottenham into 12th.",Liverpool held to 1-1 draw by Nottingham Forest at the City Ground.

Milan: Atalanta creeped closer to Serie A leaders Napoli on Tuesday after drawing an entertaining match with Juventus 1-1 and moving to within four points of the summit, while AC Milan came from behind to beat Como.Mateo Retegui salvaged a point for Atalanta with a close-range header 12 minutes from time, not long after returning to action from the bench following four weeks on the sidelines with a hamstring injury.The Italy striker's finish, which levelled Pierre Kalulu's 54th-minute opener for Juve, put him out on his own at the top of the Serie A scoring charts on 13 goals and pushed Atalanta to 43 points, ahead of table-topping Napoli's crucial trip to Bergamo this coming weekend.Gian Piero Gasperini's side, who are bidding for their first league title after winning the Europa League last season, sit level on points with second-placed Inter Milan.However, champions Inter have two games in hand on both Atalanta and Napoli and play the first of those fixtures against Bologna at the San Siro on Wednesday.""It was a great match tonight, and I'm very happy with the way my boys played,"" said Gasperini to Sky.""It was difficult going behind because we were hoping to go ahead but I think at the end of the day a draw is probably a fair result.""Tuesday's draw was Atalanta and Juve's rescheduled fixture due to their trip to Saudi Arabia to contest the Italian Super Cup earlier this month with Inter and winners AC Milan.Juve were again without a recognised striker due to an injury crisis which has left both Dusan Vlahovic and Arkadiusz Milik sidelined but Thiago Motta's side were a constant threat.Moments before his opener Kalulu watched on in frustration as his glancing header hit the inside of the post and was just scooped off the line by Atalanta goalkeeper Marco Carnesecchi.And Kenan Yildiz put wide a great chance to snatch a last-gasp win deep in stoppage time, shortly after substitute Nicolo Zaniolo slapped a golden opportunity for the hosts straight at Juve goalkeeper Michele Di Gregorio.""To draw like that in the closing minutes hurts a bit. We played well and had the chances to win today,"" said Kalulu.Juve remain unbeaten but have now drawn 13 of their 20 league fixtures and sit fifth, 13 points behind Napoli.Earlier, Theo Hernandez and Rafael Leao saved Milan from an embarrassing defeat at Como with the goals which gave Sergio Conceicao's new team a 2-1 win.Trailing to Assane Diao's fine low strike on the hour mark, star players Hernandez and Leao turned the match around by the 76th minute, handing Conceicao his first league win as Milan coach.Tuesday's victory in one of their two games in hand moved Milan up to seventh on 31 points, five behind fourth-placed Lazio as Conceicao tries to reignite the Italian giants' bid for Champions League qualification.""They (Como) are a good team with a good coach, it's not easy to play here,"" said Conceicao.""It was an even game but we can't concede as much as we did, we need to be more organised.""Left flank pairing Hernandez and Leao had reportedly been at loggerheads with Conceicao's predecessor Paulo Fonseca, who was sacked at the end of December following a dismal opening half of the season.Both praised their new coach after he arrived just before the new year and immediately won the Super Cup for Milan, who came from two goals behind to beat Inter in Saudi Arabia earlier this month.Hernandez levelled for Milan 11 minutes after Como new boy Diao's opener when his mishit volley sliced off his left boot and looped past goalkeeper Jean Butez.Leao dinked home the decisive goal shortly afterwards, meeting substitute Tammy Abraham's excellent through ball before netting his seventh goal in all competitions.",Atalanta draw 1-1 with Juventus in Serie A.

Sadaoui steals the winner for Blasters,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/indian-super-league/top-stories/sadaoui-steals-the-winner-for-blasters/articleshow/117221568.cms,"KOCHI: Noah Sadaoui emerged as the hero for Kerala Blasters as they secured a stunning 3-2 victory over Odisha FC in the ISL encounter at Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium, Kochi, on Monday. Sadaoui netted the winner in the 90+5th minute, having earlier provided the assist for Jesus Jimenez 's strike in the 73rd minute.The match sprang to life as soon as it started, with Odisha FC taking an early advantage through Mawihmingthanga's goal in the fourth minute.A clearance from Odisha's half landed in the Blasters' penalty area. Despite the ball bouncing in front of Pritam Kotal, the Indian international hesitated and failed to make a proper clearance. Odisha's striker Dorielton Nascimento capitalised on the defensive error and directed a header towards Mawihmingthanga, who gently guided the ball past Sachin Suresh to put the visitors ahead.After falling behind, Blasters launched numerous attacks on the Odisha goalmouth, clearly controlling the latter part of the first half and the initial minutes of the second half. Their persistence paid off in the 60th minute. Korou Singh, who was positioned in the attacking third, surprisingly retreated to the midfield, catching the Odisha defence off guard. He then provided Kwame Peprah with a precise pass from the right of the centre line, splitting two Odisha defenders. Peprah, left with only goalkeeper Amrinder Singh to beat, slotted the ball skilfully to draw the scores level.Soon after the equaliser, Blasters strengthened their strike force by substituting defender Alexandre Coeff with striker Jesus Jimenez. This tactical change proved beneficial for the hosts when Jimenez put Blasters ahead in the 73rd minute. Luna delivered a cross from the right flank to Sadaoui positioned near the far post, who directed a header towards Jimenez. The striker simply extended his foot to guide the ball into the net, securing a 2-1 lead for Blasters.Odisha managed to level the score when Dorielton Nascimento converted a rebound in the 80th minute. However, Odisha's fortunes took a turn for the worse when Carlos Delgado, who entered as a substitute in the 66th minute, received his second yellow card in the 82nd minute for consecutive fouls, reducing his team to ten players.Blasters made the numerical superiority count when Sadaoui found the back of the net during stoppage time. His strike from inside the penalty box took a fortunate deflection off Rahim Ali and looped into the net to give Blasters a much-needed victory.","Noah Sadaoui netted the winner in the 90+5th minute, having earlier provided the assist for Jesus Jimenez's strike in the 73rd minute.

Arsenal v Manchester United | Key Moments | Third Round | Emirates FA Cup 2024-24

Manchester United scored first with a sublime strike (David Beckham in 1999 and Bruno Fernandes in 2025).

Arsenal had a goal ruled out for offside (Nicolas Anelka in 1999 and Gabriel Martinelli in 2025).

Arsenal equalised (Dennis Bergkamp in 1999 and Gabriel in 2025).

United had a player sent off (Roy Keane in 1999 and Diogo Dalot in 2025).

United’s keeper saved a fantastic penalty and made numerous other saves to keep them in the game (Peter Schmeichel in 1999 and Altay Bayindir in 2025).

Full Penalty Shootout | Arsenal 5-4 Manchester United | 2005 FA Cup Final

Coaching The Fundamental

Since Sir Alex Ferguson retired in 2013, Manchester United fans – particularly those who reached adolescence when the Class of 1992 made the first-team cut – have channelled their inner Ronin (Hawkeye’s murderous avatar into beg the team not to give hope. Over the years, there have been numerous false dawns, slivers of light ahead of the tunnel that have made United fans dream again before they were snatched away, like Morpheus’ Nebuchadnezzar’s lament: “I had a dream, but the dream was taken from me.”There was the Van Gaal era where fans were convinced that a former tactician – a man some claim invented modern football – could bring United back to the glory years.Then they convinced themselves that the Special One, by sheer dint of willpower and personality (and a little bit of the dark arts), the fallen Lucifer to Pep Guardiola’s Michael, would be the right person to resuscitate the Red Devils. They almost persuaded themselves, when Ole was at the wheel, that the good times were rolling again. It certainly felt like that on that night in Paris and when United were playing like the Fergie teams of yore. They even dared to hope that a man named Eric would lead the charge again, much like the collared Frenchman who did it in the early Fergie years.And now, Ruben Amorim, the youngest Man Utd manager in half a century, is playing the Pandora’s Box’s old trick again. Of course, on paper, Amorim’s record is nothing to write home about. His record in his first 13 games reads: five wins, two draws and six losses. Most other Man Utd managers actually have better records. Sir Alex Ferguson’s read: three wins, seven draws and three losses. It’s what came after those 13 games that makes Manchester United fans believe.But there has been something of the old grit that defined Fergie teams that has Utd fans daring to hope again. The back-to-the-wall performance evoked an older Man Utd vs Arsenal clash: the epic 1999 replay.The similarities are astounding between the 1999 FA Cup semi-final replay and the 2025 third-round showdown between the two clubs.The only difference in the 2025 match was that it was decided on penalty shootouts and not a wondrous Ryan Giggs goal that made Maradona look up from his cocaine pile.And in a strange way, it was a mirror image of the 2005 FA Cup final with its infamous Band of Brothers viral image featuring Paul Scholes, Roy Keane, Cristiano Ronaldo, Wayne Rooney , Ryan Giggs, Mikaël Silvestre and Quinton Fortune.Incidentally, Manchester United battered Arsenal in that match – a follow-up to the infamous 4-2 “I will see you out there” Highbury fight – but still lost on a penalty shootout with Paul Scholes missing the last penalty. That day, United had eight shots on target, 12 off target, and 12 corners (far more than Arsenal) but still lost.It was a different ballgame in 2025. Arsenal had 26 shots to Man Utd’s seven, 71% of the possession, and a 3.3 xG to United’s 1.1 but failed to make their mark. United players have been struggling to adapt to Ruben Amorim’s style, but against Arsenal (like they did against Manchester City and Liverpool), there was a slight glimpse of the taste in the pudding.In the cult classic Coach Carter – when Samuel L. Jackson was whipping a bunch of askew young men into shape – he was asked by his team what they should do since they hadn’t practised attacking. To this, Jackson’s Carter had said: “Run.” And that’s what United players did in the match, all of them running together as a pack to keep Arsenal at bay.Harry Maguire, often the pantomime villain on the football pitch and even in parliaments around the world, was a colossus in defence. Equally driven were Lisandro Martínez and Matthijs de Ligt, the latter finally learning how to operate in a three-man midfield.Of course, Arsenal’s inability to finish was one of the major reasons this match went to penalties, with Kai Havertz moved around the pitch like Roy Keane was screaming “You can’t score in a brothel!” in his ear.But United fans will rejoice at the grit from a team that, during the last days of the Ten Hag era, looked like they were simply not interested in playing football. Whether it was Bayindir’s redemption after the horror performance against Tottenham in the Carabao Cup, academy graduate Toby Collyer’s gut-bursting runs, Bruno’s Roy Keane impression or Noussair Mazraoui and Manuel Ugarte in midfield, this was a team effort.And the performance came against refereeing that launched a thousand memes about Arsenal players diving with abandon, which included a soft penalty and a red card.A swallow doesn’t make a summer, and Manchester United will probably have to suffer for many more years before they finally have a team worthy of cleaning the boots of any of the vintage Ferguson teams. But for the moment, United fans can at least hope that the current side, even if they lack the sheer world-class talent of the Band of Brothers or the 1999 winning team or any of the great Fergie teams, will give it their all every time they are wearing the United shirt.Next up in the FA Cup: Ruud van Nistelrooy’s Leicester City, the last interim manager of Manchester United and a man who knows a thing or two about the gigantic expectations that come with wearing the Manchester United shirt.",Manchester United lost 3-2 to Arsenal in the 2025 FA Cup third round. The match was a mirror image of the epic 1999 FA Cup semi-final replay. The only difference between the two matches was that it was decided on penalty shootouts.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117203496,imgsize-67192,width-400,resizemode-4/117203496.jpg"

In an alarming coincidence, each of their three home losses in this ISL campaign have come by that very scoreline.In a game that took until the second half to come to life, it was Mohammed Sanan who set the visitors on their way in the 64th minute with a clinical finish.Just as Mumbai City so nearly drew level when Nikolaos Karelis's left-footed effort stung Albino Gomes's palms in the closing minutes, Jordan Murray (86th) sealed the three points for Khalid Jamil's side following a quick break after Jamshedpur had won back possession.There was time for one final dagger which arrived in stoppage time as Javi Hernandez (90+6) fired home from inside the box.The win saw Jamshedpur climb to third place, level on points with Bengaluru (27pts) with a game in hand. Mumbai, meanwhile, still occupy sixth spot and that final playoff berth, but were left to rue another bitter outing at home. Although they went into this game with a confidence-boosting 3-2 win at East Bengal last week, there is no doubt that the Islanders are finding goals hard to come by this season.Coach Petr Kratky has even resorted to switching captain Lallianzuala Chhangte from his favoured position on the right of their usual three-man attack to playing in the hole behind the front three.It would yield no dividends on this occasion, as Jamshedpur's backline were disciplined enough to deal with anything Karelis, Vikram Partap Singh or Bipin Singh were able to ask of them.To make matters worse, Chhangte was sent off after the game for dissent.","Jamshedpur beat Mumbai City 0-3 at the Mumbai Football Arena.

Tyagi is a direct entrant in the main draw, alongside Tamil Nadu's Rethin Pranav, a step he labelled ""very big"".""I am confident of a good show in Australia,"" Tyagi told TOI.""This is the highest level in the junior category. I am not thinking about the results so much. I want to go out there, give my 100 percent and simply have a good time on court.""With an impressive run since May last year, the long-haired youngster worked his way up to No. 34 in the ITF junior rankings .

However, he could not replicate the form in his last couple of outings, suffering early exits in J500 events in Merida (Mexico) and Bradenton (USA).His recent form isn't bothering him too much though. ""These tournaments were of a comparatively higher level.

NEW DELHI: Fifth seed Daniil Medvedev , who was the runner-up last year’s at the Australian Open , on Thursday suffered a stunning second-round exit, losing to 19-year-old qualifier Learner Tien in a dramatic upset at Melbourne Park.Making his Australian Open debut, the American teenager, ranked 121st in the world, shocked Medvedev with a thrilling 6-3, 7-6 (7/4), 6-7 (8/10), 1-6, 7-6 (10/7) win.Left-handed Tien, from California, celebrated the biggest triumph of his burgeoning career on Margaret Court Arena at nearly 3:00 a.m.He will face France’s Corentin Moutet in the next round.The marathon match, lasting four hours and 48 minutes, was marked by relentless action and a brief rain delay near the end.Tien had already made an impression in the first round, defeating Argentina's Camilo Ugo Carabelli in five sets for his first Grand Slam victory in four attempts.For Medvedev, the defeat capped a disappointing campaign. The 28-year-old former world number one, who has reached three of the last four Australian Open finals -- including a 2024 loss to Jannik Sinner -- exited with uncharacteristic errors and frustration. His struggles this season were evident in his first-round match, where he required five sets to overcome 418th-ranked Kasidit Samrej, smashing his racquet and a net camera in the process.Against Tien, Medvedev initially displayed composure but faltered as the match progressed. The young American seized the first set in 47 minutes and showcased his resilience during a 32-shot rally in the eighth game.In the second set tie-break, Medvedev’s frustrations peaked as a double foot fault contributed to his loss of the set.The third set saw Medvedev save match point with a clutch ace and eventually secure the tie-break to stay alive. He then dominated the fourth set, seemingly regaining control, and appeared poised for a comeback as Tien showed signs of fatigue.However, Tien dug deep in the final set, finding renewed energy to battle Medvedev.The pair traded early breaks before rain briefly interrupted play at 5-5, 15-all on Tien’s serve.

Sriram-Miguel advance to next round in men's doubles

MELBOURNE: A pair of 23-year-olds took the Rod Laver Arena for a second-round match of the Australian Open – world no.1 Jannik Sinner and Aussie wildcard entrant Tristan Schoolkate , ranked 173 in the world.It was likely they knew each other, perhaps from their junior days, but Sinner, who didn’t play much on the junior tour, and Schoolkate, who played football until he was 14, but did well in the juniors thereafter, hadn’t crossed paths.Schoolkate, backed by the home crowd, started strong in the opening set, before the defending champion weighed in and turned around the match for a 4-6, 6-4, 6-1, 6-3 result in two-hours and 46-minutes.“He was playing great tennis, especially the first set. For a set-and-a-half he was serving much better than I was,” Sinner said. “It depends how someone (whose game you are not familiar with) starts the match, if you manage to break him a little bit earlier, then it gives you this confidence. You play a bit more freely. But he was playing, especially in important moments in the first set, he was serving big serves, amazing volleys.”It was a cold, windy day at Melbourne Park and Sinner, who hadn’t lost a set since October, struggled with the conditions in the early part of the match, but won 16 of the final 21 games from 2-3 in the second set.Sinner, who has inadvertently been caught in a doping storm, has more on his hands with coach Aussie Darren Cahill set to retire at the end of the season. Cahill, who has coached Andre Agassi and Simona Halep among others, had said the Italian would be the last player he would coach.“I don't want to talk so much about his retirement,” Sinner said. “I feel very, very lucky and happy to be his last player on Tour. He has been an amazing, amazing coach and person, not only for me but for all the other players he has worked with. For me it's just a huge honor. Hopefully we can make a nice season.”Fourth-seed Taylor Fritz and home hope Alex de Minaur , seeded eight, also moved into the third round. Fritz dropped just three games in a 6-2, 6-1, 6-0 victory over Chilean qualifier Cristian Garin and De Minaur defeated American qualifier Tristan Boyer 6-2, 6-4 6-3 in just under two hours. The American will play Frenchman Gael Monfils next and De Minaur takes on the 31st seed Francisco Cerundolo of Argentina.On a day when there were five Indians in action in the men’s doubles schedule of the Australian Open -- Sriram Balaji and Mexico’s Miguel Reyes-Varela --- got the better of Dutchman Robin Haase and Kazakh Aleksandr Nedovyesov 6-4, 6-3 for the lone win for the Indians.In a clash of alternate pairings Greek Petros Tsitsipas and Bosnia’s Damir Dzumhur got the better of the Indo-Polish combine of the left-handed Anirudh Chandrasekar and Karol Drzewiecki 7-6 (1), 2-6, 7-6 (6).In another first-round engagement, the sixth-seeded duo of Briton Henry Patten and Finland’s Harri Heliovara, who didn’t face a breakpoint in their 66-minutes on court, charged to a 7-6 (5) 6-1 win over India’s Rithvik Bollipalli and American Ryan Seggerman.The French-Brazilian team of Gregoire Jacq and Orlando Luz put out alternates Jevan Nedunchezhiyan and Vijay Sundar Prashanth 6-2, 6-2.In all there were seven Indians, who made the doubles draw at Melbourne Park, only one was an all-Indian combine.",Sriram-Miguel advance to next round in men's doubles at Australian Open.

MELBOURNE: There were so many golden yellow shirts floating around the 1573 Arena that it looked like a sea of yellow. Every now and then when Joao Fonseca unleashed a winner the Brazilian fans would erupt into their tune of the evening -- Fon-Saaayyyy-Ca, Fon-Saaayyyy-Ca, Fon-Saaayyyy-Ca… It was a call, a cry, a prayer that resounded across Melbourne Park.They finally had a player, some 24-years after Gustavo Kuerten won the last of his three major titles.“It's such a nice thing about Brazilians, when we see some Brazilian doing well in sports, we like to cheer. It's a cultural thing,” Fonseca said. “They make a lot of noise. I love playing with the crowd. They really help me to stay focused in this match mentally. I didn't got the win, but I want to thank them for the support.”Lorenzo Sonego , the 29-year-old, ranked 55, was a little too poised for the qualifier, who fell 7-6 (6), 3-6, 1-6, 6-3, 3-6 in the second round of the Australian Open after three-hours and 37-minutes of play.The score, however, was incidental to the statement of the fortnight – the Next Generation is at the door.The 18-year-old -- the youngest player in the ATP’s Top-200 – played the crowd almost as well as he did the match, leaning on them when he seemed to lose his way in the second and third sets and then picking himself up in the fourth.Fonseca was gracious at the net when he met Sonego, throwing his arm around the Italian, who later joined the fans in giving the ATP’s newest entrant into the top-100 a standing ovation as he exited the stadium.“When you play five sets, the experience is different. They know better when to (step up) the intensity. There's going to be ups and downs during the match,” Fonseca said. “I need to have more experience on this. I need to work more to stay mentally focused during the whole match.”Four-time major winner Carlos Alcaraz , 21, was all praise for Fonseca.“The way he played his first Grand Slam match against his first top-10 opponent, it's unbelievable,” the Spaniard said. “He’s someone I will see, he's going to be there. This is just the beginning of the year, but he's going to be there. We're going to put Joao Fonseca's name on the list of the best players in the world really soon.”Fonseca, born in Ipanema, Rio de Janeiro, idolizes Roger Federer , so much so that he tried to model his backhand like the Swiss’s flawless single-hander.“I tried for one week and then I have something in my elbow and I go to the two-handed again,” he said, adding, “Roger, inspires me.”The result aside it would be fair to say that the opening Grand Slam of the 2025 season showcased the best of the next generation -- 19-year-old Jakub Mensik , who plays Spaniard Alejandro Davidovich Fokina in the third round on Friday, having claimed his first top-10 win at a Grand Slam when he took down Casper Ruud, and American Alex Michelsen, who knocked out the 11th seed Stefanos Tsitsitpas, and will play the 19th seed Karen Khachanov on Saturday.American Taylor Fritz , the Australian Open’s fourth-seed, saluted the teenagers, saying he was impressed by their show.“When you are that age getting to play these big matches there's no expectations, no pressure,” he said, adding, “When I was younger, the top four or five was pretty ridiculous. We had Rafa (Nadal), Roger (Federer), Novak (Djokovic), Andy (Murray) and Stan (Wawrinka), all those guys at one time.”“It was tough to break through playing a top-8 seed,” Fritz said. “I think maybe now it's a little more winnable for the younger guys because all the top seeds aren't some of the best players of all time.”","Joao Fonseca beats Lorenzo Sonego 7-6 (6), 3-6,. 1-6, 6-3, 3- 6 in the second round of the Australian Open.

He was playing much better than I was at the beginning,"" said the 23-year-old Italian, who also claimed the US Open last year.""I have to be very happy with my performance and never take things for granted.

American tennis player Taylor Fritz , currently ranked world number four, has announced that he will donate his first-round prize money from the Australian Open to help victims of the devastating Los Angeles wildfires. The 27-year-old, who lives in California, made the decision after reaching the third round in Melbourne by defeating Chilean qualifier Cristian Garin in straight sets, 6-2, 6-1, 6-0.First-round prize money at the Australian Open amounts to AUS$132,000 (US$82,000).Fritz , who previously resided in LA for an extended period, expressed his concern for those affected by the wildfires and encouraged others to contribute to relief efforts.""I just want everyone to obviously stay safe, it's just insane what has happened,"" said the 27-year-old.""I'm going to be donating my first-round prize money to LA wildfire relief funds.""It's really the least I can do.

NEW DELHI: Iga Swiatek advanced to the Australian Open 's third round with a commanding 6-0, 6-2 victory over Rebecca Sramkova , marking her continued return to competition following a doping suspension in the previous year.The second-seeded player immediately established dominance by breaking Sramkova's serve in the opening game and maintained control throughout the match.The Slovakian player, ranked 49th globally and making her Grand Slam second-round debut, struggled against Swiatek's superior technique and forceful play.In the initial set lasting 27 minutes, Swiatek dominated by winning 64 percent of points on Sramkova's first serve, surrendering merely 10 points.The Rod Laver Arena audience warmly applauded when Sramkova finally secured her first game in the eighth game of the match.Swiatek maintained her authority throughout, securing victory in precisely 60 minutes.""I felt really solid today and it was a really efficient game,"" said Swiatek.

Siegemund shock:

Mensik powers through:

Late in the 32-minute opening set, perhaps during the changeover when staring at an emphatic 0-5 scoreline, Naomi Osaka 's vivid sunflower hair clips came off.It might've helped untether the Japanese's fierce groundstrokes as she won 18 of the next 23 games against Czech Karolina Muchova , who she had lost successive meetings to, most recently in New York, to move into the third round of a major for the first time since January 2022.Osaka, the two-time Melbourne Park champion, rallied from a set down to defeat the 20th seed 1-6, 6-1, 6-3 on Wednesday.The 27-year-old, who recently announced on social media that she and rapper boyfriend Cordae had parted ways, sported the sunflower theme, in her hair, ears and shoes, underlining the look was fitting for the Happy Slam.""I don't know if anyone was able to take a very zoomed-in picture of my shoes, but on the side it says, 'The sun shines where you are',"" she said of her tangerine-hued lace-ups, with sunflower accents in the front. ""It was fitting to have a sunny theme (for here).""Osaka's gear contrasted the fickle Melbourne weather – dank and dismal; the crowd responded to it, getting into the contest from the get-go. Every cheer for Osaka was met with 'Do toho!' for the Muchova, 'go for it' in Czech, particularly in the decider when she trailed 2-5.The Japanese bounced up and down as she watched the ball sail long on her third match point after 1-hour and 57-minutes of riveting action.After pulling off what she called a 'revenge win' Osaka proceeded to school the full-house, saying 'revenge was competitive and a good thing'.The Osaka-Muchova match played on KIA Arena with a seating of 5000 as against the courts the four-time major winner is generally scheduled on like the Rod Laver Arena with a 15000 capacity waltzed to the tune of the crowd, who were fully involved in the contest, with fair support for both players.""I don't really mind,"" Osaka said of the size of the court. ""I think I'm the type of person that tries to focus on themselves a lot when playing, but I really did enjoy the crowd today. So if that's because it was a smaller court, then maybe I do enjoy smaller courts.""Next up for Osaka is another 27-year-old mother Swiss Belinda Bencic, a former top-5, presently ranked 294. Bencic, whose daughter will turn one in April, leads their head-to-head 3-2.""I love playing the big opponents, that's where I play my best tennis ,"" said Osaka, who put out Frenchwoman Caroline Garcia in the first round. ""If I play better opponents as the rounds go on, it's more interesting because I feel like it's like the clash of Titans almost. I think the fans probably appreciate it.""Osaka, who has been outspoken on a number of issues, said she was an athlete first and mother next when on the court.""We are labelled 'moms,' of course. I think when you go on the tennis court, you just think of yourself as a tennis player,"" she said. ""I don't want to say I've grown up with her (Bencic), but we've definitely seen each other on Tour. I think it's really cool that she also had a baby, and she came back, as well.""It wasn't the best of days for China's fifth seed Zheng Qinwen who fell 6-7 (3), 3-6 to the spirited Laura Siegemund. The German authored the tournament's first major upset.Olympic gold medallist Zheng came into the event as a possible title contender at a career-high ranking of No.5, but the defence and defiance of the World No.97 Siegemund won out in 2 hours and 16 minutes of play.Some 24-hours after Brazil's 18-year-old Joao Fonseca knocked out the world No.9 Andrey Rublev, 19-year-old Czech Jakub Mensik put out the sixth seeded Casper Ruud 6-2, 3-6, 6-1, 6-4 firing 62 winners to reach the third round.Mensik, who hit 22 aces, sparked the Margaret Court Arena where he clinched the win in 2-hours and 44-minutes.","Osaka, the two-time Melbourne Park champion, rallied from a set down to defeat the 20th seed.

Katie Boulter and Alex de Minaur have been dating for five years, as of December they were engaged, and at Melbourne Park they are sparking couple vibes.Shortly after clinching his first-round win over Dutchman Botic van de Zandschulp, De Minaur, the world No. 8, raced to the KIA Arena to watch the deciding set of Boulter's first-round clash against Canada's Rebecca Marino.Boulter, the world No.25, was in a spot of bother after losing the second set but turned around the match with the Aussie No.1 cheering at courtside.""Having Alex there, he is my support system,"" Boulter said. ""He has helped me through the rough and good moments. He kind of leads me, I would say. He has shown what an incredible tennis player he is and he's ranked top 10 in the world and has been there for a whole year, which is not an easy thing to do.""""Having him come out and support me means pretty much everything to me. Having that extra positivity from my bench makes the difference,"" the 28-year-old Briton said.Boulter's scores kept flashing on Rod Laver Arena when the Sydney-born De Minaur was on court.""It is tough just because there is a scoreboard that keeps alternating with different results throughout the day, and then all of a sudden you get the score of Katie's match,"" he said. ""You try not to pay too much attention and focus on yourself, but the fact that it's always coming around makes it difficult.""Boulter, 28 from Leicester, wished she could see De Minaur's score when she was playing.""It's obviously difficult knowing he's playing a match and you're kind of hearing cheers here and there and you're hoping that's for him, but you never know,"" she said. ""Look I'm fully focused on what I'm doing, most of the time I'm not thinking about it at all, but of course I'm hoping he wins and that he's out there for the rest of my match!""In Thursday's second-round action, De Minaur takes on American qualifier Tristan Boyer, second match on Rod Laver Arena. On Court No.3, an adjacent show court, Boulter plays Veronica Kudermetova, in the fourth match.

NEW DELHI: It was an electric atmosphere. PV Sindhu in full flight is a sight to watch. At 5 feet 11 inches, when Sindhu jumps for a smash, she easily reaches somewhere near 8 feet. From that height, Sindhu's winners are deadly. There is no chance for the opponent to lift the shuttle back into play. And when she reels off one smash after another, there is absolutely no breathing space for her rival.Japan's world No.46 Manami Suizu was at the receiving end of Sindhu's power-packed strokes on Thursday, as the Indian shuttler waltzed through to the quarterfinal of the India Open Super 750 tournament here at the KD Jadhav Indoor Stadium.It was a killer display from Sindhu as she gave a lesson on attacking badminton to Suizu, winning 21-15, 21-13. Sindhu will now face Paris Olympics bronze medallist and fourth seed Gregoria Mariska Tunjung of Indonesia in the quarters.The match saw Sindhu leap in the air multiple times, and each time there was a winner, the crowd raucously cheered the point. She made a strong start, leading 11-6 at the break. Although Suizu briefly narrowed the gap to 11-13 and 13-14, Sindhu was always a step ahead, with the Japanese player unable to cope with the Indian's powerful smashes. Sindhu continued to hit deep returns to trouble Suizu. Soon, she was 20-14 ahead and sealed the game when the Japanese hit the net.After the change of sides, Sindhu raced to a 5-0 lead. The second game was all about the Indian as she found cross-court winners at will, quickly establishing a dominant 11-2 lead at the interval, and it became clear that Suizu had no answers.""After a break, what I liked about my game today was my movement and my attacks were working well,"" Sindhu said after her win.The men's doubles pair of Satwiksairaj Rankireddy and Chirag Shetty had to recover from a first-game reversal to beat the Japanese pair of Kenya Mitsuhashi and Hiroki Okamura 20-22, 21-14, 21-16 and progress to the last-8.It looked like Satwik and Chirag would also take a straight games route to the quarters when they raced to an 18-14 lead and had a game point at 20-19 in the opening game, but they could not convert it and eventually lost the game. The blip, however, did not turn into a crisis, as the pair quickly took control of the action in the second game and then maintained the advantage to win in 1 hour 11 minutes.Youngster Kiran George, who was given a last-minute entry for the tournament due to a spate of withdrawals from many top foreign players, saved six game points against Frenchman Alex Lanier to win 22-20, 21-13 and enter his maiden quarterfinals of a Super 750 event. The 24-year-old will take on Chinese shuttler Hong Yang Weng in the last-8 clash.

Josh Hazlewood's participation in the remaining days of the Gabba Test is uncertain due to calf soreness. He bowled only one over before leaving the field on day four.Hazlewood's entry onto the field was delayed at the start of play. His bowling appeared laboured, with speeds barely reaching 131kph. His first ball was a wide long hop, readily dispatched by KL Rahul.During the subsequent drinks break, Hazlewood engaged in a discussion with skipper Pat Cummins, Steven Smith, and physio Nick Jones. Shortly after, he exited the field.“Josh Hazlewood reported calf awareness in this morning's warm-up,” a CA spokesperson said. “He will be taken for scans to assess the injury.”Australia, aiming for victory amidst intermittent rain delays, may need to rely heavily on Cummins, Mitchell Starc, and Nathan Lyon. Support from Mitchell Marsh, Travis Head, and Marnus Labuschagne will also be crucial.Enforcing the follow-on offers the best chance of victory for Australia. However, this strategy could strain Starc and Cummins, especially if Hazlewood's absence continues.Hazlewood's return to the side for this Test followed his recovery from a side strain that sidelined him in Adelaide for the second Test. A significant injury could pave the way once again for Scott Boland's return at the MCG on Boxing Day. That venue holds special significance for Boland, where he achieved a memorable 6 for 7 on debut against England in 2021-22.Cummins had previously hinted at Boland's potential involvement in the series.“[We told him] it's about preparing for the MCG because there's a good chance we might need you,” he said.“History suggests there's always some form of natural attrition throughout a Test series. A good thing [is], he's probably played a Test earlier in the series than he maybe thought. Showed that his standard's still super high. [It's] about trying to set him up for the last two Test matches.”Earlier in the year, Hazlewood experienced a mild calf strain. This injury prevented him from participating in T20Is against Scotland and England.Between the Adelaide and Brisbane Tests, Hazlewood expressed his frustration with the side strain. He revealed that the medical staff were exploring long-term solutions.“It's not necessarily your typical side strain, which I've had a couple in my career,” he said.“You're running into bowl and you just grab your hat and you're off and you're out for six weeks. It's not that sort of side strain. It's from sort of repetitive use. It's caused me a lot of trouble over the last few years, but [had] perfect prep this year, and played the Shield game and ticked all that off.”“I was very happy where I was and it still happened. So I was pretty annoyed there for a few days. There was plenty of meetings from CA's point of view [with] physios, doctors, all that stuff. So come up with a few options and see if we can stop it from happening again.”","Hazlewood bowled only one over before leaving the field on day four.

New Zealand secured a resounding victory against England in the third Test at Hamilton, winning by a massive 423 runs on the fourth day. This win provided a fitting farewell for Tim Southee in his last international match.England, having already secured the series win with victories in the first two Tests, were set a daunting target of 658 runs. They fell significantly short, being bowled out for 234 after lunch.England captain Ben Stokes, nursing a left hamstring injury from the previous day, did not bat in the second innings, accelerating the match's conclusion.England's resistance crumbled quickly in the final session. They lost their last three wickets in just 12 deliveries, adding only three runs to their total.Mitchell Santner, with figures of 4-85, was named Player of the Match for his crucial role in dismantling England's tail. This victory marked New Zealand's largest ever win by runs and inflicted England's fourth-worst defeat by runs in Test history.“It's obviously pleasing to finish in that fashion,” said New Zealand captain Tom Latham.Latham praised his team's adaptability after their earlier struggles in the series. He highlighted the significance of adjusting to the Hamilton pitch conditions.“We certainly knew we weren't quite at our best those first couple of games, but I think the way we came in here and were able to adapt to the surface was very pleasing.”Tim Southee, in his final Test innings, took two wickets, ending his international career with 391 Test wickets. This places him second on the all-time list for New Zealand, behind only Richard Hadlee. He didn't add to his six sixes hit on day three, finishing with 98 career sixes.“We're certainly leaving one of the greats behind, but I'm sure he's got a bright future ahead of him, whatever that may be,” Latham added.Despite the heavy defeat in the final Test, England's series victory remains a significant achievement. They became the first England team to win a Test series in New Zealand since 2008.Young batter Jacob Bethell continued to impress in his debut series, scoring his third half-century. He eventually fell for 76, becoming Southee's final Test wicket.Joe Root, a mainstay of the England batting lineup, contributed a half-century, scoring 54 before being dismissed by Santner.Harry Brook, who played a key role in England's earlier victories, could not replicate his success in the third Test. He scored only one run before being caught in the slips off Will O'Rourke's bowling.O'Rourke's delivery, which climbed sharply to find the edge, further cemented his reputation for extracting bounce and movement.Gus Atkinson provided some late entertainment with a brisk 43 off 41 balls. His innings included seven fours and a six.Atkinson's dismissal, caught in the deep off a mistimed shot, signalled the imminent end of the match.“We want to come out and win every game that we play,” said Stokes.Stokes acknowledged the disappointment of the heavy defeat but emphasised the importance of the series victory.“It's obviously disappointing as a team to finish like we have done but ... the first two test matches is where it really counted for us, and that's where we played our best cricket.”","New Zealand beat England by 423 runs in the third Test at Hamilton.

NEW DELHI: Former India cricketer Cheteshwar Pujara on Monday questioned Virat Kohli's technique against the new ball following his dismissal in the ongoing Gabba Test.Reflecting on the incident, Pujara noted that Kohli's approach may not be fully equipped to handle the challenges posed by fresh, moving deliveries.While speaking on Star Sports, Pujara explained that the lacklustre performance of India's top-order batters has contributed to Kohli's modest showing in the current Border-Gavaskar Trophy series.""We were discussing that he has been forced to play the new ball. He has gotten out whenever he has played the new ball. When he played the old ball, he scored a hundred in Perth. So that's also a very big point,"" Pujara said.""His technique is not made for the new ball. His batting should come after 10, 15 or 20 overs. If he plays the new ball, the bowlers are fresh, and their confidence is also high. When they get two wickets, the entire team is charged up. So when you come to bat at that stage, it's not easy,"" Pujara added.Kohli's brief stay in the middle yielded just three runs while India found themselves in a precarious position at 51/4 during their first innings on Day 3 of the third Test at Brisbane. Earlier in the day, the Australian side was dismissed for a total of 445 runsIn the first Test at Perth, while Yashasvi Jaiswal and KL Rahul forged an impressive 201-run opening stand, Kohli managed to notch up an unbeaten century. However, his performance in the remaining four innings has been underwhelming, with a total of just 26 runs, where he failed to reach double digits on three occasions.Pujara observed that despite Kohli's dedicated practice sessions in the nets, he has struggled to implement those techniques effectively on match days.""When the bowling is happening in just one area, on the fourth to sixth stump, and he is playing that and getting out, it's not a good thing. He understands that himself. We saw in the net session as well that he was leaving balls in that area, but that execution is not happening in the match,"" he said.The seasoned Indian batter suggested that Kohli requires a bigger mental adjustment than a technical one. Throughout the current series, all of Kohli's four dismissals have resulted in catches by the wicketkeeper or slip fielders. Josh Hazlewood has claimed his wicket twice, while Mitchell Starc and Scott Boland have each dismissed him once.""In the match, for some reason, he wants to leave the ball but is unable to, and the bat is going there. So he will have to stop himself. He will have to change his mindset. There is a technical part that you are playing a delivery outside off-stump. However, if you have to leave the same delivery, it's not a very big technical adjustment but he needs to make a bigger mental adjustment,"" Pujara said.",Former India cricketer Cheteshwar Pujara questions Virat Kohli's technique against the new ball. Kohli was dismissed for just three runs during India's first innings on Day 3 of the third Test at Brisbane.

India's dismal show in the ongoing Brisbane Test after a one-sided defeat in Adelaide has come under the scanner, but the team's vice-captain Jasprit Bumrah said they can't be ""pointing fingers at each other"", especially when the team is going through ""transition"".Bumrah has been carrying the weight of the team on his shoulders in a one-man show that has seen him taking 18 wickets so far in the five-Test Border Gavaskar Trophy.On day three of the Gabba Test in Brisbane, Bumrah completed a six-wicket haul to keep the visitors alive in the rain-hit third match of the series, which is currently level at 1-1. But the Indian batters continued to disappoint, slipping to 51 for 4 in response to Australia's first-innings total of 445, thanks to centuries by Travis Head (152) and Steve Smith (101)Bumrah hasn't found support from the rest of the pacers in India's squad on a consistent basis and has been overburdened with the task of taking wickets.""We don't want to get into that mindset where we're pointing fingers at each other,"" said Bumrah after the close of play on Monday. ""As a bowling unit, we are in transition. So it's my job to help others.

""A lot of new players have come into the side, so we have to be considerate and give them that cushion that will help them learn.India had won historic Test series on their last two tours of Australia, but Bumrah said those teams had more experience than the current one.""We had a little more experienced side when we came here last time, but this is a journey that every team will go through.

Live from Brisbane: Crazy rain stops play | Forecast not good for third India-Australia Test

Shubman Gill: 'We will treat it as a three-match Test series'

It was a frustrating morning of waiting in Brisbane as heavy downpour allowed very little cricket on the opening day of the third India-Australia Test in Brisbane. Only 13.2 overs were bowled and the fans got their umbrellas out, put the raincoats on but held on to their beer and enjoyed their Saturday morning, even if it was without any cricket.With the players rushing indoors, the gentleman on the live grill was aggressively dishing out the sausages to the thousands who had come for a big fat party!Amid all this, former Australia cricketer Matthew Hayden 's daughter was casually strolling in the corridor with very little cricket a dampener for her too. The 22-year-old, however, was still up for a chat on cricket and touched upon her love for India, the food and the spices.""I love India. I always heard a lot about India growing up from my dad, he still brings spices home. So I'd always be trying Indian food. I love a dal curry and a roti. Love your roti. Dad would always bring India home to us. So people would always say to me, you know, 'did you struggle at first with Indian food?' And I said, 'No, I love it',"" said Grace in a candid chat with TimesofIndia.com.Having watched a lot of cricket herself on the television, and even from the ground, she follows the circuit very closely and is a big fan of India wicketkeeper-batter Rishabh Pant . It took her half a second to name Pant has her favourite cricketer from this Indian team and it was the youngster's return from the horrific car crash which continues to be an inspiration.""I think his comeback story has been sensational. We saw him go as the most expensive player in IPL history just recently. And yeah, we all saw the vision of the accident, and for him to come back and still start and even make this incredible team is just credit to him. The hard work, determination, mentally that would have been really tough to come back from. Obviously I'm Australian, but I'm proud of him, and he obviously has great strength as a player, as a person. He's always been exceptionally lovely. He's definitely an inspiring player,"" says Grace.Pant is definitely a crowd favourite in this part of the world but the same can't be said about Mohammed Siraj. The seamer was constantly booed when he stood on top of his run-up today and even while the series has been a bit low-key on the onfield drama, the Travis Head-Siraj episode definitely injected some fire. Has the IPL, like the rain today, dampened the intensity between these two sides as compared to the years gone by?""I think because the IPL is around, these players are playing together more often. They're intertwining all the time. But I think when you are stepping onto the field playing for your country, none of that matters, and it always has been the case you want to win for your country,"" said Grace and added that her father himself was a fierce competitor on the field but completely different off it.""My dad is a big teddy bear giant.

India bowling coach Morne Morkel explains why India chose to bowl first in Brisbane

NEW DELHI: Virat Kohli ’s repeated dismissals outside the off-stump in Australia are a sign of worry not only for the India batting legend but also for the team with the Border Gavaskar Trophy and a place in the World Test Championship (WTC) final on the line.In the third Test of the five-match series at the Gabba in Brisbane, Kohli was again dismissed caught behind while chasing a wide ball and nicking it to be caught by Alex Carey off Josh Hazlewood.Except his unbeaten hundred in the second innings of the Perth Test, all of Kohli’s dismissals in this series have been caught behind the wicket.Kohli's weakness against deliveries outside the off-stump is well documented, particularly early in his innings. This vulnerability has been exploited by bowlers across formats, especially in Test cricket.Kohli has a natural tendency to play expansive cover drives. This can lead to loose shots against balls that are wide and swinging or seaming away, and bowlers often exploit this by bowling a fourth- or fifth-stump line, drawing him into the drive.When Kohli is fresh at the crease, he is more susceptible to deliveries outside the off-stump. His eagerness to get going sometimes results in loose shots.Swing bowlers like James Anderson and Pat Cummins have often troubled him by moving the ball away late, forcing edges towards the slips or the wicketkeeper, when playing away from his body.Bowlers set him up with deliveries outside off, gradually increasing the challenge by varying lengths and movement. A well-placed fielder at gully or a third slip often supports this line of attack.It is here that Kohli can draw inspiration from Sachin Tendulkar ’s unbeaten 241 that the maestro played in Sydney during the 2003-04 tour.It was the last Test of the series, which was level at 1-1, and also the last Test for Aussie legend Steve Waugh. Tendulkar was yet to make a mark in the series and was getting dismissed caught behind the wicket before this marathon knock.Batting first, Aakash Chopra (45) and Virender Sehwag (72) set the stage for Tendulkar, who came up with a master stroke to baffle the Aussies. Tendulkar simply took the cover drive out of his game, refusing to score between mid-off and point and not getting lured by deliveries bowled outside his off-stump by the Aussie pacers. What Sachin showed at the SCG that day was a lesson in batting.In an exhibition of masterful batting that resulted in Tendulkar's third Test double-century and 32nd hundred, Tendulkar added 353 runs with another Australia tormentor VVS Laxman (178) as Brett Lee conceded 201 runs off 39.3 overs and India declared at a mammoth 705/7. Waugh had to bat out of his skin in the second innings to save the game for Australia.Tendulkar's approach in that innings was a masterclass in adapting to challenging conditions and overcoming personal vulnerabilities.The knock was a testament to his mental toughness and patience. By leaving balls outside off-stump and focusing on scoring in safer areas, he neutralized the Australian bowlers and frustrated their plans.Kohli, too, can bring similar patience and discipline to fix his troubles. Tendulkar played within his limitations, showing that adaptability and situational awareness are crucial to succeed in tough phases of a series.Kohli could take a leaf out of this by not allowing bowlers to dictate terms. Adjusting his technique and shot selection depending on the conditions and opposition plans would help him counter his weaknesses.Tendulkar's 241 not out wasn't just about eliminating errors, it was also about maximizing the time at the crease and wearing down the opposition. He displayed unmatched concentration for over 600 minutes, showing that great innings require sustained focus.Kohli, who thrives on long innings, could benefit from doubling down on his ability to bat for extended periods by cutting out risky shots when conditions demand.By following Tendulkar's Sydney approach, Kohli can rise above challenges to deliver match-winning performances in the toughest of conditions.In successful phases, Kohli has shown the ability to leave balls outside off, especially in Tests. His ability to curb his instincts makes him harder to dismiss this way.Though Kohli has worked on tightening his technique, particularly in challenging conditions like England and New Zealand, the bait outside the off-stump remains a constant test for him, as it does for many great batters.","Kohli's weakness against deliveries outside the off-stump is well documented.

NEW DELHI: Rohit Sharma has faced intense criticism following India's disappointing performance in the ongoing third Test against Australia at The Gabba.With Australia cruising at the moment, the pressure has continued to mount on the Indian captain, especially after a difficult Sunday, leaving fans frustrated and vocal about his decisions.India won the toss on Saturday and opted to field, a decision that has sparked widespread bitterness.Fans online were quick to express their dissatisfaction, with some arguing that India should have batted first instead of bowling on a pitch that allowed Australia’s openers to settle in comfortably.The frustration has boiled over, and numerous calls for Rohit's resignation have flooded social media platforms.One fan on X, formerly Twitter, expressed their dismay, writing, “He's just not meant for this job, he needs to accept it and resign immediately after this Test irrespective of the outcome of this match.”The sentiment was echoed by others, with another stating, “Rohit Sharma is on the verge of losing five consecutive Tests. We need to start a serious discussion about his captaincy now, and also sack Gambhir for the betterment of Indian cricket .”Rohit's leadership has been scrutinised during this match, with India struggling to capitalise on key moments in the field.The bowlers, such as Jasprit Bumrah and Mohammed Siraj, have fought hard, but Australia’s top order, led by Travis Head and Steve Smith , has managed to dominate the proceedings.""Look, I mean, today, I thought Akash Deep bowled really well.

NEW DELHI: Jasprit Bumrah continued his sensational run in international cricket in 2024, surpassing legendary all-rounder Kapil Dev in two significant bowling milestones, further cementing his reputation as India’s finest pacer in overseas conditions.On day two of the third Test against Australia in Brisbane, Bumrah stood as India’s lone warrior with the ball, dismantling the hosts’ batting order even as Steve Smith and Travis Head piled on the runs.He dismissed both centurions and ended the day with impressive figures of 5/72 in 25 overs, maintaining an economy rate of 2.90.Bumrah also accounted for the scalps of Usman Khawaja, Nathan McSweeney, and Mitchell Marsh.This marked Bumrah’s 10th five-wicket haul outside Asia, surpassing Kapil Dev’s record of nine. He has become the first Indian to so do.Bumrah now has three five-wicket hauls in Australia, three in South Africa, and two each in the West Indies and England. By comparison, Kapil recorded five in Australia and two each in England and the West Indies.In SENA (South Africa, England, New Zealand, and Australia) conditions, Bumrah has also eclipsed Kapil, registering his eighth five-wicket haul in these regions compared to Kapil's seven.Bumrah’s latest feat ties him with Australia captain Pat Cummins for the third-most five-wicket hauls in the ICC World Test Championship (nine each). Only Nathan Lyon (10) and Ravichandran Ashwin (11) are ahead.The 2024 calendar year has been nothing short of extraordinary for Bumrah. He is the leading wicket-taker in international cricket, with 73 dismissals in just 20 matches at an average of 13.78 and best figures of 6/45. Of these, 58 wickets have come in 12 Tests—the most by any bowler this year—at an exceptional average of 15.20.All four of his five-wicket hauls this year have come in Tests, underlining his dominance in the format.",Jasprit Bumrah surpasses Kapil Dev's record of nine five-wicket hauls outside Asia.

NAVI MUMBAI: Buoyed after their 49-run win over West Indies in the opening T20I at the DY Patil Stadium , the Indian women's team is sweating over the fitness of their captain Harmanpreet Kaur ahead of the second WT20I at the same venue on Tuesday evening.While she scored an unbeaten 13 in India's total of 195 for four, Harman didn't come out to field as vice-captain Smriti Mandhana led the side.""She suffered a niggle on the knee while batting. However, it's a bit early to say that she will be ruled out of the second T20I,"" a source told TOI. At the post-match presentation ceremony, Mandhana said, ""She's doing fine. She is under the observation of the medical team.""Meanwhile, Titas Sadhu, who took 3-37 as India restricted West Indies to 146 for seven in the opening T20I, explained why the team didn't appear to be sluggish despite having travelled n early 7, 300 kilometres from Perth -the venue of their third and final ODI against Australia on Wednesday- to Mumbai. ""The fact that we landed here at night and we slept through the whole night properly, and so that kind of helped with the jet lag,"" Sandhu said.The DY Patil Stadium has been a lucky venue for Sadhu. On Jan 5 this year, the 20-year-old had taken 4/17 to skittle Australia out for 141 and star in India's thumping nine-wicket win over world champions in the first T20I of that series.Having played four out of her 10W20I matches at this venue has naturally helped the young seamer get accustomed to the conditions at a venue where bowling in the night, especially with so much of dew falling around, isn't an easy task.""I think DY Patil (Stadium's) is a very true wicket and whoever is able to bowl in the right areas, get some help out of the wicket. One of the best things was that we have played here before at the same time of the year, so we are accustomed. We have knowledge about it, and that being the key, and so we knew there will still be some help from the wicket if we can actually bowl at the right areas and fortunately, we did that,"" she said.",Harmanpreet Kaur didn't come out to field as vice-captain Smriti Mandhana led the side. Kaur suffered a niggle on the knee while batting.

'MCA had backed Shaw well'

MCA announces additional prize money for winning bunch

MUMBAI: It was a rebirth of Ajinkya Rahane that few saw coming.Shrugging off poor form in the Ranji Trophy for the past couple of seasons, the 36-year-old batsman was in the form of his life in the 2024-25 Syed Mushtaq Ali T20 Trophy in Bengaluru, smashing 469 runs in nine matches@58.62, including five half-centuries, scoring his runs at a fabulous strike rate of 164.56. Relieved of captaincy with the selectors asking Shreyas Iyer to lead the team in the tournament, Rahane batted freely, playing a stellar role in Mumbai's second SMAT triumph in the past three seasons.Opening the innings due to the team's requirement to do so, Rahane raised his game when it mattered the most has scored 98 off 56 balls in the must-win match vs Andhra, 84 off 45 balls in the quarterfinal against Vidarbha, 93 off 53 deliveries against Baroda in the semifinal, and 37 off 30 balls in the final vs Madhya Pradesh on Sunday at the Chinnaswamy Stadium, which Mumbai won by five wickets. In the process, he has also staked a claim to be the Kolkata Knight Riders ' captain for IPL-2025 .At a felicitation function organized by the Mumbai Cricket Association at its HQ at the Wankhede Stadium on Monday, Iyer showered praise on the veteran batsman's willingness to move up from the middle-order to the opening slot to cater to the team's requirement.""Rahane was ready to bite the bullet and he did it. And at the end of the tournament, he became the highest run-scorer, the Player of the Series. So, kudos to him,"" Iyer said, with head coach Omkar Salvi, MCA president Ajinkya Naik and other association officials sitting next to him.""Even though he knew that there were three-four openers in the team, he was okay to adjust. And then when Surya came in, we decided that he would open. So that transition from No 4 to open, some batsmen, they can't adapt that easily,"" Iyer added.When Rahane is in full flow, he's a delight to watch. ""The way he was batting. I mean, standing on the opposition end, the way he was smashing the ball, it was just pleasing to the eye,"" Iyer gushed.Iyer complimented Rahane for the way the senior batter contributed to the team despite losing his Mumbai T20 captaincy. ""Certainly, he has got immense experience we have seen over the years. More than that, I personally feel that he is a great team man. The amount of input he provides on the field and off the field is tremendous. Even on the field, you have to see how proactive he is throughout, running here and there. If the chips are down, he will be the first person to come and give you advice,"" Iyer said.Iyer was also highly impressed by Mumbai's next 'wonder kid,' the talented young allrounder Suryansh Shedge , who blasted explosive cameos at the No 6 spot, including a crucial 36 not out of just 15 balls in the final against MP, and pointed out to the 21-year-old's ""phenomenal work ethic"".""I personally feel, off the field, his (Shedge's) work ethic is phenomenal. That guy is always the first one to arrive at practice, asks a lot of questions. He wants to learn a lot. It's not that he is always satisfied with scoring runs. He has got a great attitude, his approach towards the game is brilliant and I feel that is what is going to take him ahead in the future,"" Iyer admired.Salvi revealed that the MCA was backing opener Prithvi Shaw , who was making a comeback into the side after being dropped from the Ranji Trophy, and the batter would ""peak at the right time.""""I think the association has backed him well. Even though he was not part of the Ranji Trophy, I think the association took care of his practice, his fitness. There were routines given to him for the three weeks to be followed. I think that was pretty much taken care of by the association and the coaches from the academy. We were all very involved in it. And I think he came over there, he took that effort, he did his hard yards over there,"" Salvi said.""And then he came over here in this format, from those preparations. I think he is building up well. I think he will peak at the right time/ That's what we expect,"" he added.Reflecting on what he had learnt from a year in which he experienced a rollercoaster ride-he lost his spot in the Indian team in the Test and T20 formats but captained KKR to the IPL triumph and Mumbai to the SMAT victory, Iyer said, ""The best learning I have got from all these things is to stay in the present. Enjoy the moment. Once I start to think about the future and the past, I am in a cluster.""""I somehow try to blame a certain person, him, whoever is involved. For me, I seek happiness when I am sitting right here talking to you. Stay in the present,"" he added.Meanwhile, MCA president Ajinkya Naik on Monday announced that the MCA will award additional prize money, matching the BCCI's prize money (Rs 80 lakhs) as a reward to the Mumbai team for winning the Syed Mushtaq Ali T20 Trophy title in Bengaluru on Sunday.It means that the Mumbai team, which beat Madhya Pradesh by five wickets in the final at the Chinnaswamy Stadium, will get Rs 1.6 cr prize money in total after winning the title.In a year in which Mumbai have completed a hat-trick of titles-the Ranji Trophy at home in Mumbai in March, followed by the Irani Cup triumph in Lucknow in October and then the SMAT title in Bengaluru in December, the MCA has been generous in rewarding the winning bunch.","Mumbai batsman Ajinkya Rahane was named Player of the Series in the 2024-25 Syed Mushtaq Ali T20 Trophy.

Pace mainstay says bowling unit in transition, Siraj's 'fighter spirit' appreciated

TimesView The Indian top order has floundered again. It's worrying that the batters have displayed a uniform lack of discipline in their approach. Test cricket is hard and none, barring KL Rahul, have shown the will to grit it out. Thanks to rain, the Test can still be saved. But it cannot happen unless our millionaire cricketers from the world's richest board apply themselves to the task.

BRISBANE: India's vice-captain and fast-bowling ace Jasprit Bumrah has dispelled notions that a lack of support from the rest of the bowling lineup has hurt India on this tour and increased his own workload, saying that ""it's my job to help the others"" and that the team is in a state of ""transition"".After becoming only the second Indian fast bowler after Kapil Dev to take 50 wickets in Australia, Bumrah, whose 6/76 off 28 overs helped restrict a rampaging Australia's first-innings total to 445, said when asked about the issue, ""If I come across a problem, I look at how I can solve it, what I can do in this scenario rather than whining or complaining or pointing fingers.""I've been happy with the way the ball is coming out. We don't as a team point fingers at each other. We don't want to get into the situation where we are saying, 'You should do this, you should do that'. As a team, we're going through a transition where new players are coming here. It's not the easiest place to play cricket. As a bowling unit, we're in transition and it's my job to help the others. Everyone will learn through it, get better and eventually find different ways. This is the journey you'll have to go through,"" he said.Bumrah has been head and shoulders above the rest of India's pace lineup on this tour and is currently the leading wicket-taker across both teams, with 18 wickets from five innings at an average of 11.72 and strike rate of 27.33. Mitchell Starc , with 13 scalps, is a distant second, while the next best Indian pacer is Mohammed Siraj with 11 wickets (strike-rate 41.54).Siraj has been copping a lot of flak from the Aussie media following his bust-up with Travis Head in Adelaide and the crowds have taken to booing him whenever he is in action. Siraj also looked flat in Australia's first innings here, but Bumrah said the pacer was nursing a niggle and is in a good place mentally.""We had conversations before we came to Australia,"" Bumrah said of Siraj. ""When we came here in Perth, as well as the last Test, he looked in good spirits. He was bowling well and has picked up a few wickets.""Siraj, however, has seemed frazzled with all the negative attention and even had a brain fade when he swapped bails after a delivery to Labuschagne. ""In this game, I think I'll give him credit because he had a bit of a niggle but still kept on bowling. He knew if he didn't, the team would be under pressure. He's got a fighter spirit the team loves. You wanted to play Test cricket , you are doing that. Your family is proud of you. He's in a very good space, that is what I know of. I don't know what else is happening,"" Bumrah said.Bumrah himself has been nonpareil on this tour, and his stature as a once-in-generation fast-bowling phenomenon is growing by the day. At the Gabba, after creating some early inroads, he came back with the second new ball to take three wickets in 12 balls, drawing batters forward but not bowling driveable lengths, enabling him to find the edges with regularity.After bagging his 12th five-wicket haul in just his 43rd Test on Day 2, on Monday Bumrah added to his tally by getting Starc caught behind. ""It has been good so far,"" he said. ""I find different challenges interesting. Perth was different to Adelaide, and here (in Brisbane) the wicket is at a level and the run-up is low (at a lower level). In India, we're used to straight, level grounds, so it's different. I enjoy these challenges. I always look to find answers.""","India's vice-captain Jasprit Bumrah has dispelled notions that a lack of support from the rest of the bowling lineup has hurt India on this tour. He said that ""it's my job to help the others"" and that the team is in a state of ""transition"" Bumra is currently the leading wicket-taker across both teams, with 18 wickets.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116384373,imgsize-56734,width-400,resizemode-4/116384373.jpg"

On rain-hit day, Indian top order implodes yet again in face of relentless Aussie pace attack at The Gabba

KOHLI'S STRUGGLES CONTINUE

BRISBANE: India sank deeper into the mire as rain played havoc here on Monday.On a bizarre stop-start day which saw the covers being put on and removed eight times, a familiar script played out as the top order made some strange calls and collapsed with next to nothing on the board.In the limited 33.1 overs of play possible, Australia first consolidated their advantage, adding 40 runs in the morning to get to 445. Subsequently, Mitchell Starc and Josh Hazlewood did the rest with the new ball to leave India tottering at 51/4 from 17 overs faced.Only KL Rahul, who opened the innings again, played to the situation and adapted to the conditions, made an effort to blunt the new ball and ended the day batting on 33. Giving him company was the edgy and totally out-of-character Rohit Sharma , whose lack of runs compelled him to go down the order again.Australia's relentless pace attack induced silly errors from the other batters and raised the question whether India's Test-match batting is close to imploding on this tour. For Yashasvi Jaiswal and Virat Kohli , in particular, the Perth heroics will now seem a distant memory.India's first-innings collapses have been a constant feature of their last five Test campaigns across home and away conditions. They have crossed 200 only once, against New Zealand in Mumbai, and their highest first-innings total on this tour is the 180 in Adelaide. Will winning the toss and debatably opting to field first change the script here?Australia's top three had shown the way on the second day, but most of the Indian batters who got out seemed reluctant to see off the new ball, bide their time, leave on length and trust their defence. That India had to continuously walk off because of the rain and reapply themselves on this surface didn't help.The stoppages seemed to have made Jaiswal edgy even before India's openers walked out to the middle. He had lasted one ball against Starc in the first innings in Adelaide and was keen to rectify matters.Jaiswal was all padded up with his partner nowhere in sight, then decided to face some throwdowns later as the ground staff were getting the square and outfield ready for play. He was seen playing the flick, and a shot hit a videographer focused on Australia's huddle. Jaiswal immediately rushed to apologize.With the cushion of runs behind them, Australia began with four slips and a gully and one forward square leg. Jaiswal drove hard at the first ball, which was pitched up and swinging away from him, and the outside edge raced to the boundary. Off the second ball, an innocuous half volley, he unleashed an airy flick straight down Mitchell Marsh's throat at forward square leg.The nervous energy had scrambled Jaiswal's brain and he had lasted just one more delivery than Adelaide. This is the third time in five innings that Starc has now dismissed the left-hander, taking Jasiwal's average against left-arm pace down to 17.33 from 9 innings.Next in, Shubman Gill played out three balls from Starc before the bowler had him first ball of the third over, the batter needlessly going for the big drive to a fuller delivery outside off. The edge flew to the left of gully, and it was Marsh again with a fine take. Two loose shots, two soft dismissals, and in walked Virat Kohli.Kohli was beaten on the drive first ball from Starc, was lucky not to get an outside edge to the second ball, then inside-edged one shaping back and managed to get off the mark. He seemed eager to get going but Hazelwood's next over to him was a maiden, the batsman beaten by a fine inswinger third ball.A Hazlewood delivery subsequently strayed on the pads and fetched a single. Another quick single against Starc followed. So did an awkward nothing shot against a surprise short one, with Kohli failing to pull away and fending awkwardly.Next over first ball, Hazlewood baited him with a wider one. Kohli promptly chased after it and found only the edge to the 'keeper. Gone for three, a torrid 16-ball stay ending in all-too-predictable fashion and immediately setting off the alarm bells.Sunil Gavaskar, in the Channel 7 booth, said, ""If it was on the fourth stump I could understand. This was wide, on the seventh, eighth stump. There's no need to play that. He has such a strong bottom hand. He can play straight or towards mid-wicket. He needs to just stop playing towards off.""Others insisted a technical glitch may be to blame, with Kohli's bat coming in from second slip instead of the vertical, forcing the batter to shape up inside the line of the ball before searching for the delivery. Only Kohli will know why he took the bait, and what needs to be done to make amends.Since Jan 2020, he averages only 31.67 as compared to a career average of 54.5. This year Kohli has eight single digit scores, the joint-most in his career since a similar drought in 2014.By now India were in deep trouble at 22/3, and it wasn't to be Rishabh Pant to pull off the rescue act. Multiple rain stoppages later, Pat Cummins tore through Pant's awkward defence for the third time in this series.Only Rahul, who bided his time, played with a short backlift, did not chase the ball, cashed in only on genuine run-scoring opportunities and ended the day with a thunderous cover-drive off Starc, can save this Test now for India. Either Rahul, or the rain, which is expected again on the fourth day.","India's first-innings collapses have been a constant feature of their last five Test campaigns across home and away conditions.

South Africa captain Temba Bavuma will be absent from the opening ODI against Pakistan in Paarl on Tuesday. This decision is a strategic move to manage his workload in preparation for the crucial two-Test series. This series will determine South Africa's qualification for the World Test Championship final. Aiden Markram will captain the South African team in Bavuma's absence for the first ODI. Bavuma is expected to return for the remaining matches in the series.This series presents a unique opportunity for South Africa to field their strongest possible squad before the Champions Trophy. The team faces the delicate balancing act of preparing for the major tournament while ensuring adequate rest for their Test players.Eight players from the ODI squad participated in the recent 2-0 Test series victory against Sri Lanka. These players, Bavuma, Markram, Tony de Zorzi, Tristan Stubbs, Ryan Rickelton, Marco Jansen, Keshav Maharaj , and Kagiso Rabada, are also expected to play key roles against Pakistan.The team management is particularly concerned about the fast bowlers due to recent injuries within the pace department. Several key bowlers are currently unavailable or recovering from injuries.Wiaan Mulder is recovering from a broken finger and is aiming to be fit for the Boxing Day match. Lungi Ngidi is sidelined until January with a hip injury, and Gerald Coetzee is also out until January due to a groin niggle.Nandre Burger will miss the entire season due to a lower back stress fracture. Anrich Nortje, who could have provided support for Rabada and Jansen, is unavailable due to a broken toe. Nortje has also withdrawn from red-ball cricket to address recurring injuries.""Not everyone that we'd normally call upon is around because of injuries.

Bangladesh's chief selector, Gazi Ashraf Hossain , has voiced his concerns regarding Litton Das 's recent performance dip in white-ball cricket. He suggested a potential break for the struggling batter if necessary.Litton's poor form was evident in the recent series against the West Indies. He only managed scores of 2, 4, and 0 in the three ODIs. His struggles continued into the T20I series, where he was dismissed for a duck in the first match, despite Bangladesh's narrow seven-run win.""We also understand that the team has high expectations from Litton, given his quality as a batter.

Nevertheless, he expressed concern over Litton's dismissals and suggested potential coaching intervention or a break if required. He also acknowledged the possibility of Litton's return in the upcoming matches.Ashraf expressed surprise at Litton's captaincy appointment in the absence of the injured regular skipper, Najmul Hossain, despite his ongoing form slump.""The selection of the national team falls under our jurisdiction, but deciding who will captain the team is the board's prerogative. Whether it's a short-term or long-term decision, the board determines this based on the situation. That's what happened this time as well. After I joined, I was asked to recommend captains and vice-captains only for the 'A' team and the High-Performance team, not for the national team,"" said Ashraf.""As the chief of the selection panel under the board, I am speaking from my position, which comes with job responsibilities and ethics. Beyond that, I can't comment further at this moment. The board probably made a decision based on some short-term calculations. It's not like the board had many other options either, as several players were injured,"" he added.Speaking from his position as chief selector, Ashraf highlighted his responsibilities and ethical obligations. He refrained from further comment on the captaincy decision, suggesting it was based on short-term considerations and limited options due to player injuries.Ashraf also addressed the uncertainty surrounding Tamim Iqbal and Shakib Al Hasan 's participation in the Champions Trophy. Shakib has faced various challenges, including political issues hindering his entry into the country and scrutiny over his bowling action. He now requires clearance to bowl in international and domestic cricket.Tamim, meanwhile, has begun preparations for the upcoming Bangladesh Premier League (BPL) by participating in the ongoing National Cricket League (NCL) T20 tournament. He has already scored two half-centuries, indicating his readiness after a seven-month break from the game.""I don't have direct answers to certain questions. Regarding Shakib Al Hasan's issue, you are all already aware of it. I cannot provide any clear statements on that matter. The communication process with Shakib is through Cricket Operations. As for Tamim Iqbal, he has resumed playing, which is a ray of hope. I believe we'll know very soon whether he will be available or not. If he is, that's wonderful,"" said Ashraf.""This is a completely different issue compared to Shakib's. In Tamim's case, if someone withdraws themselves, as you know, there was a previous board with differing opinions and several issues. However, under this board, a positive aspect is that Tamim is returning to the field and preparing himself for a major tournament. We are in a position to discuss things with him.""The board and the selectors will sit together to find a solution. Tamim needs to improve his fitness further. When a player has been playing for so long, they know how to refine and prepare themselves for the global stage. Whatever help he needs, the board will provide. This shouldn't be an issue,"" he added.",Chief selector Gazi Ashraf Hossain expresses concern over Litton Das' form. Suggests potential coaching intervention or a break if necessary. Litton's poor form was evident in the recent series against the West Indies. Tamim Iqbal and Shakib Al Hasan's participation in the Champions Trophy remains uncertain.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116374386,imgsize-63632,width-400,resizemode-4/116374386.jpg"

Virat Kohli is one of the greatest players ever: Mitch Marsh

We as a team are going through transition: Jasprit Bumrah

NEW DELHI: Virat Kohli 's ongoing struggles with the bat became the huge talking point in cricketing circles with former players and experts weighing in on what it would take for the star India batter to overcome his weaknesses against deliveries outside the off-stump.Former India batter Aakash Chopra also talked about Kohli's perennial problem of getting dismissed on outside the off-stump deliveries. He mentioned that while Kohli had previously overcome this problem, it has resurfaced to trouble him once again.Kohli endured another failure when Josh Hazlewood had him caught behind for 3 on the third day of the third Test in Brisbane.""There is no doubt that there is a problem. It is well documented. The problem outside the off-stump comes repeatedly and starts troubling you. When he had problems on the England tour of 2014, he made changes in his batting, started taking a massive stride, and changed his stance as well,"" Chopra said on his YouTube channel.""He has changed his game a lot. However, towards the end of his career, the same problem is coming again. He commits a slight error of judgment against deliveries outside the off-stump and ends up playing them. In fact, it's not that only. He was surprised by a bouncer and then closed his bat early and almost got caught and bowled off a top edge,"" he added.Chopra also suggested that Kohli may need to avoid playing deliveries outside the off-stump, similar to how Sachin Tendulkar adapted his approach during the 2004 Sydney Test.""You obviously know that he is not at the top of his game. So what is the road ahead? I think there are two things. One, I remember the Sydney Test match after Sachin Tendulkar was repeatedly getting out to deliveries outside the off-stump. Can Virat Kohli do that? He will have to do that because if he keeps getting out like this, the vulnerability is exposed even more,"" he said.",Kohli endured another failure when Josh Hazlewood had him caught behind for 3 on the third day of the third Test in Brisbane.

(Reuters)

Rome: Inter Milan are hot on the heels of Serie A leaders Atalanta after crushing Lazio 6-0 in Rome on Monday to demolish one of the division's form teams and send a message to the rest of the league.Reigning champions Inter came through what was supposed to be a tough test at the Stadio Olimpico with flying colours and are three points off the Scudetto pace with a game in hand.Simone Inzaghi's side sealed the points with goals equally distributed either side of half-time from Hakan Calhanoglu, Federico Dimarco, Nicolo Barella and Denzel Dumfries, before Carlos Augusto and Marcus Thuram completed the rout with two late strikes.""It's three-and-a-half years that these boys have given me this level of commitment and I'm proud to be their manager,"" said Inzaghi to DAZN.Inter have an Italian Cup tie with Udinese on Thursday and league fixtures against Como and Cagliari before jetting off to Saudi Arabia, where they face Atalanta in the semi-finals of the Italian Super Cup on January 2.""It's going to be complicated but I hope we put in the same effort and level of performance like the one tonight,"" added Inzaghi.An unexpectedly heavy defeat for Lazio, who came into Monday's showdown off the back of fine away wins at Napoli and Ajax, left them fifth and six points behind Atalanta.Inter statementIt also damaged any ideas of Lazio being dark horses for a first league title in a quarter of a century as Marco Baroni's side crumbled once Calhanoglu rammed home the penalty which opened the scoring in the 41st minute.""I'm sorry for our supporters and I take responsibility for the defeat. We played well for the first 40 minutes but then collapsed, we fell apart"" said Lazio coach Baroni.""We did things that you just can't do against a team like Inter and that means I didn't do a good enough job.""The awarding of Inter's spot-kick, for a Samuel Gigot handball following a VAR check, came just after Inter had had a goal chalked off for offside during the same penalty box melee and angered Lazio.And the hosts, who had been the better side in the opening half an hour, were punished for lax defending when Dimarco volleyed home a brilliant second four minutes later after sneaking in unmarked at the back post to meet Dumfries' pinpoint cross.Any hope of a second-half fightback was ended when Barella crashed in his third goal of the season from distance in the 51st minute and Dumfries capitalised on more poor Lazio defending two minutes later with a bullet header.Carlos Augusto then become the third Inter wing-back to score of the evening in the 77th minute when he expertly controlled Dimarco's pass to spin Adam Marusic and calmly slot home the fifth.Thuram's brilliant individual strike wasn't just a slap in the face for Lazio, it also made Inter Serie A's top scorers ahead of Atalanta and emphatically showed that they won't give up their title easily.","Inter Milan thrash Lazio 6-0 in Serie A.

Manchester City 's Phil Foden maintains that the players continue to support manager Pep Guardiola despite their recent loss to Manchester United , which prolonged their disappointing run.Following Sunday's 2-1 defeat to Manchester United at the Etihad Stadium, City has now lost eight of their last eleven matches across all competitions.City's defense, which has been a recurring issue in their decline, faltered in the final minutes, allowing United to score twice and further diminish the Premier League champions' chances of securing a fifth consecutive title.Currently in fifth place, City trails the league leaders, Liverpool, by nine points, with Liverpool having a game in hand. City has already suffered five league defeats this season, compared to just three throughout the entire previous season.After the game, Guardiola admitted, feeling the weight of the worst crisis of his managerial career, that he is ""not good enough.""Despite this, Foden affirms that the squad remains behind Guardiola, who recently signed a new two-year contract.“We are still nowhere near our level, but I still believe that we are playing good enough to get points and results,” he said.Foden believes City is playing well enough to earn points and achieve positive results, despite not reaching their full potential.He highlights the team's tendency to lose focus at crucial moments, emphasizing the need for sustained concentration throughout the entire match.“It's about remaining focused throughout the full 90 minutes, but we keep switching off at important times. We just need to get the focus right.” he said.He emphasizes the importance of unity, regrouping, and drawing confidence from past accomplishments. Foden underscores the team's continued faith in Guardiola's methods.“We stick together, regroup and believe in ourselves after what we've achieved in the past.” he said.“We keep believing in the process and the manager -- I'm sure if we do that we will get back to winning ways and get back to our level.” he said.City faces a crucial Premier League match against Aston Villa on Saturday, needing to rediscover their winning form.Foden admits to being perplexed by City's sudden downturn, noting the evident impact on team morale following the derby loss.“I can't put a finger on what's going on,” Foden said.He believes their performances have warranted better results but acknowledges a recurring pattern of missed opportunities. He stresses the importance of team cohesion during this challenging period.“I thought the performance was more than good enough to get the result, but we come out with no points, and it seems to be the same story at the moment. We just have to stick together.” he said.He acknowledges the current disappointment within the team but emphasizes the need to move forward.“The changing room is obviously going to be down and sad at the moment, but we can't dwell on this too much.” he said.Following the Villa match, City will host Everton on December 26th and then travel to Leicester for their final game of 2024.With the demanding festive season approaching, Foden urges his teammates to maintain their unity and resilience.“It's about keeping our mentality strong throughout the whole 90 minutes and we're not doing that at the moment,” he said.He calls for the team to display character and overcome this difficult period. Foden expresses optimism about City's ability to rebound and regain their previous form.“We have to go again and show character to come back from this blip.” he said.“It's not a time for moaning, it's about sticking together, remaining strong and going again. I'm positive we are going to come back.” he said.City's upcoming fixtures present a crucial opportunity for them to address their current slump and reclaim their position among the league's top contenders.","Manchester City lost 2-1 to Manchester United at the Etihad Stadium on Sunday.

Ruben Amorim shakes up Manchester United with daring Marcus Rashford exclusion,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/top-stories/ruben-amorim-shakes-up-manchester-united-with-daring-marcus-rashford-exclusion/articleshow/116375385.cms,"Ruben Amorim (Reuters Photo)

Ruben Amorim achieved his most significant victory since joining Manchester United , possibly with a sense of relief after making a tough decision. He benched forwards Marcus Rashford and Alejandro Garnacho for ""selection"" reasons for the Manchester City match. The gamble proved successful with a 2-1 win, thanks to late goals from Bruno Fernandes and Amad Diallo .Since replacing Erik ten Hag , Amorim has been candid about the challenges at Old Trafford. The win against Manchester City shows his commitment to implementing changes at the 13th-placed club.Amorim has demonstrated a willingness to rotate players, even leaving out prominent names. However, dropping Rashford and Garnacho, two key attackers, from the entire squad was a bold move.Amorim cited ""selection"" as the reason before the Etihad game, with both players training at United's facilities that morning.“For me what is important is the performance in training, the performance in game, the way you dress, the way you eat, the way you engage with teammates and push teammates.”He later clarified it wasn't a disciplinary issue but hinted at expected standards.“Everything is important in our context, the beginning of something when we want to change a lot of things, when people in our club are losing their jobs. We have to put our standards really high, and for that they have to fight for their place in their team.”Amorim emphasized the importance of teamwork for achieving victory.“Today we proved we can leave anybody out of the squad and you can manage to win if you play together.”He stated that everything would be reset before United's next match against Tottenham in the League Cup quarter-finals.“Next week, next game, new life and they are fighting for the places.”Rashford posted a supportive message on social media after the win, while Garnacho remained silent.Rashford's future at the club is uncertain given his inconsistent performance since scoring 30 goals in the 2022/23 season. This isn't the first time the England forward has faced consequences for disciplinary issues.Garnacho, considered a promising talent, has also been inconsistent. His refusal to celebrate a goal against Leicester led to Fernandes suggesting that Garnacho felt fans had lost faith in him.Former United captain and Sky Sports pundit Gary Neville supported Amorim's decision, criticizing Rashford and Garnacho's work ethic.“They've both been poor on the pitch, that's a fact.”Neville highlighted Amorim's statement regarding the players' performance and engagement with teammates.“And Amorim said the selection issue was down to performance and engagement with teammates. That means if they've not been good in the group. That's why they weren't here.”Neville described Amorim's decision as bold and necessary for the club.“What he's done is made a bold call. What he has to do is shake this club to its core.”He emphasized the importance of Amorim building a team that fits his 3-4-3 formation.“He needs to make sure he's brutal with it, really brutal. And he's been brutal today.”Another former United captain turned TV pundit, Roy Keane , viewed Amorim's move as setting a precedent.“It's a big talking point because he's obviously seen things he doesn't like.”Keane acknowledged the players' poor performance as the reason for Amorim's decision.“But for us it's not a big surprise because both players have been poor and he has said enough is enough.”Keane saw this as a clear message from Amorim.“He is putting a marker down. Let's see how they react to it.”","Ruben Amorim benched Marcus Rashford and Alejandro Garnacho for Manchester United's 2-1 win over Manchester City.

Spanish giants Barcelona suffered a 0-1 upset defeat to Leganes on Sunday, with Sergio Gonzalez 's well-timed header proving decisive as the hosts squandered numerous opportunities, marking their second straight league loss at home.Despite their impressive Champions League campaign, securing five victories in six matches, Barcelona's La Liga form has been poor, managing just one win in their previous six fixtures.Barcelona maintain their position atop the La Liga table with 38 points, equal with Atletico Madrid - their upcoming Saturday opponents - whilst Real Madrid sit one point behind in third position, with both challengers holding a match in reserve.This historic victory marked Leganes's first triumph at Barcelona's home ground, positioning them at 15th place with 18 points.The decisive moment came in the fourth minute when Leganes captain Gonzalez, finding space at the near post during a corner kick, directed a powerful header beyond goalkeeper Inaki Pena's reach.Barca immediately upped the ante to find the equaliser; but despite dominating proceedings throughout the match with over 80% possession, they missed a handful of opportunities.Barcelona's accuracy was poor as they missed 16 of their 20 attempts, whilst Leganes' goalkeeper Marko Dmitrovic proved exceptional with three remarkable first-half saves.The Serbian goalkeeper, aged 32, demonstrated outstanding reflexes in the 10th minute, thwarting Robert Lewandowski's immediate strike following Raphinha's skilful run down the left wing.His excellence continued in the 33rd minute with an outstanding save, deflecting Raphinha's volley onto the crossbar, followed shortly after by denying Lewandowski in a one-on-one situation.After the interval, the home side's difficulties increased as they squandered numerous opportunities.

Andre Agassi

believes Djokovic will miss Federer & Nadal, the guys he came to the dance with

Excerpts:

Djokovic's longevity:

Andy Murray coaching Djokovic:

Carlos Alcaraz

and longevity…

American men haven't had results like the women:

Graf was the hardest victory I ever had: Agassi

BENGALURU: Andre Agassi wondered if the 24-time major winner Novak Djokovic would miss his greatest rivals -- the now-retired Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer -- in the last leg of a glittering career where the 37-year-old goes for more history.The eight-time Grand Slam champion, in the city for the TiE Global Summit, assessed Djokovic's run and the Serb's recent partnership with friend and rival Andy Murray in a candid chat with media.It's hard to say, Father Time always wins. He has already done so much for so long, it's hard to imagine longer. We said that about (Roger) Federer too. I think Novak will run out of energy more than capability. Cannot be easy, especially when the people you came to the dance with have left, that's a big thing.When Pete (Sampras) retired it was a blow to me, it set me back a little bit. It made me rediscover my inspirations on some level. Djokovic has lost the guys he made history with. It'll probably get tougher and tougher emotionally, but I would never bet against them. Bet against them at your peril.In any coach-student relationship you need trust and trust can take time, but it's nice when it starts with believing in somebody because you know that they know your experience. There's an asset to their history as competitors.Any success of a relationship is based on complete buy-in and that's always the part you have to wait and see. It's not what I know that changes your career, information doesn't lead to transformation, somebody has to counter that. That's the connector. I'm sure there's going to be a lot of trust immediately, we'll see how the results go.Alcaraz defends like Novak, has more power and spin like Nadal, hands and finesse like Federer but just because he has the best of all the three doesn't mean he can do what they did. There are so many parts to the game such as decision-making, injuries, luck. So how long can (Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner) do it (for)? They could do it for 20 years or not.The women's game hasn't had to deal with Roger Federer, Novak Djokovic, Rafael, Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz, but they have their version of it. Serena Williams is the Novak of the women's game and you got Coco as a potential, like Alcaraz has potential and Sinner has potential.How the game evolves is interesting. The women's game has gotten very powerful, just straight power. For lack of a better example, Lindsay Davenport was powerful, tall, precise through the court and now you have a lot of that. There's still room for somebody who can offset that kind of power, like an Ash Barty.The men's game has changed in the sense that guys have gotten bigger with longer levers, which means they're better athletes, they can move and they need more time, they start playing further back. Soon you're going to start seeing the net game start coming back, everything morphs in its own way. But the biggest issue for American (men) not winning is an unfortunate set of decades where the guys were very stingy and very greedy -- 66 Grand Slams in the same generation. There's not a lot left there (for others)!Andre Agassi - the second of five men to achieve a career Grand Slam in the Open Era and the first man to complete a career golden slam - has won it all, including a stirring love match.""She was the hardest victory I ever had,"" said Agassi of his wife German tennis legend Steffi Graf, a 22-time major winner.Agassi, who has won eight major titles and the Olympic gold, speaking during a session at the TiE Global Summit, said, ""We all live a hero's journey - first part of life is about performing and achieving. Then life hits us with broken relationships and dreams. I went through it all. Finally, in the last phase of the journey, it's about serving others.""The 54-year-old said, ""At 28 my (tennis) career started over. Without the struggles, I would've never gotten Steffi to say yes. I tried to get her for years.""On a lighter note, Agassi said he likes to keep his trophies out of the house. ""I don't bring my trophies home, because if I bring my trophies home, then she brings her trophies home - and that's bad math!""",Andre Agassi believes Novak Djokovic will run out of energy more than capability.

NEW DELHI: Legendary player Andre Agassi observed that Carlos Alcaraz embodies distinct qualities from Novak Djokovic Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal , while advising the tennis world against anticipating the young Spaniard to match the extraordinary achievements of these tennis legends.The collective Grand Slam victories of Federer, Nadal and Djokovic stand at 66, whilst Alcaraz, aged 21, has secured four major titles thus far.""I'm not a genius and I don't have a crystal ball. What I can tell you is Alcaraz defends like Novak, has power and spin like Nadal and has hands and finesse like Federer,"" said Agassi during a talk session in Bengaluru.The eight-time Grand Slam victor Agassi elaborated on why excessive expectations shouldn't burden Alcaraz.""Just because he has the best of all those three doesn't mean he can do what they did because there're so many other parts to the game, which mean decision-making, injuries, you know, luck,"" he said.With Djokovic at 37, approaching retirement, Agassi noted that the Serbian's competitive edge might diminish without Nadal and Federer in the arena.""He's already done so much, so long, and it's hard to imagine longer. I think he'll run out of the energy for it more than the capability of it, I would imagine.""It cannot be easy, especially when the people you came to the dance with have left.""The American provided additional context to his assessment.""When Pete (Sampras) retired, it was a blow to me. It set me back a little bit. It made me have to rediscover my inspirations on some level.""And he's (Djokovic) lost the guys that he's made history with. So, it's probably emotionally going to get tougher and tougher quickly, but I would never bet against him. Bet against him at your own peril,"" said Agassi.Regarding Djokovic's recent appointment of Andy Murray as coach to extend his career, Agassi expressed interest in their partnership's development.""They've been fierce rivals on court, and now Murray will be coaching Djokovic. Well, in any coaching student relationship, you need trust. Trust can take time.""I think there's an asset to their history as competitors, but any success of a relationship is based on complete buy-in.""",Andre Agassi says Carlos Alcaraz embodies distinct qualities from Novak Djokovic Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal.

NEW DELHI: Tennis icon Andre Agassi on Tuesday highlighted how sports should remain integral to education, noting their role in teaching children to cope with defeat.At a Bengaluru event focussed on sports and education's role in fostering excellence, Agassi shared his insights.""Even when you have a failure, you have to get up and play again the next day. So, what sports is teaching you is that focusing on winning and losing is really a distraction from what we need to be thinking about. We need to be thinking about how to get better,"" he said.Since 2001, Agassi has invested in education for underprivileged children, establishing 130 schools serving approximately 80,000 students in the United States. He attributes this achievement to his persistent drive to overcome obstacles.His demanding tennis career shaped his ability to maintain focus and adapt when necessary.""Sports is all about problem-solving. Tennis taught me how to navigate a very intense environment and maintain my objectivity and problem-solving abilities. It forces me to be present, but also to understand the context of what I'm doing,"" Agassi said.Regarding his earlier defiant period, Agassi acknowledged it as a necessary phase in his journey.""Vulnerability is essential for growth, and I think vulnerability eventually leads to humility,"" he added.He recognised technology's crucial role in education, particularly in providing individualised learning opportunities for children. This belief influenced his investment in the Indian EdTech company, Square Panda .""I think technology can play an essential role, not just in scalability, but also in optimising personalised learning. That's why I got involved with Square Panda. We are here because of the sheer scale of impact the technology will bring to education,"" he said.","Tennis icon Andre Agassi highlighted how sports should remain integral to education.

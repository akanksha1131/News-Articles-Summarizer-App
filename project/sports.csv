MUMBAI: Express pacer Mayank Yadav is likely to miss the upcoming white-ball series against England at home, comprising five T20Is and three ODIs due to an injury, TOI has learnt.The injury-prone Yadav, who made his international debut in the T20I series against Bangladesh in Oct last year after impressing for the Lucknow Super Giants in IPL-2024, had missed the four-match T20I series against South Africa subsequently in Nov to an injury. The young fast bowler has not returned to action since.""He's suffering from a back injury and is unlikely to be fit for the England series. He hasn't even been named amongst the probables for Delhi's first Ranji match of the second leg against Saurashtra from January 23,"" a source in the BCCI told TOI.The 22-year-old, who has been recovering at the BCCI Centre of Excellence in Bengaluru for the last few months, last played a competitive match on October 12 last year-the third and final T20I against Bangladesh in Hyderabad. The Delhi and LSG pacer missed the Syed Mushtaq Ali T20 Trophy and the Vijay Hazare Trophy after that.According to sources, the selectors are likely to first pick the Indian team for the five-match T20I series, which will kick off from January 22 with the opening T20I in Kolkata.

NEW DELHI: Spin legend Ravichandran Ashwin believes that because Rishabh Pant has ""one of the best defences"" in international cricket, he will make a century in every match if the innovative Indian wicketkeeper-batter can control his extravagance and impetuosity.Ashwin praised Pant's ability to completely change a match on his own, but he claimed that many of his strokes are risky and that this prevents him from reaching his full potential.After a valiant 40 in the opening innings of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy match against Australia in Sydney recently, Pant got the second-fastest Test fifty by an Indian.""We have to tell him properly what he has to do if he has to bat solid or bat with intent. He hasn't scored a lot of runs, but he didn't play like someone without runs. He has a lot of time on his hands. Rishabh Pant is yet to realise his fullest potential,"" said Ashwin on his Youtube channel.""He has all the shots -- reverse sweep, slog sweep, everything -- but the problem is that all these shots are high-risk shots. With his defence, he will surely score runs every game if he faces 200 balls.""The point is finding that middle game. If he combines all of it, he will score 100 runs every game. He has to find that middle game,"" the recently-retired cricketer added.In the first innings of the SCG Test, Pant scored 40 runs off of 98 balls, while in the second innings, he scored 61 runs off of 33 balls. However, the keeper was unable to repeat his feats from the 2020-21 BGT, where he led India to a historic victory in the series-decider at Gabba, which was hitherto renowned as Australia's fortress.Ashwin was not shocked by the keeper's persistent innings in the first essay, even though Pant is known for his propensity to play expansive shots.""I have always grown up hearing that you have fight it out. In Sydney, he played two different knocks in one single game. He got hit everywhere and scored a 40, it will be the least spoken innings of Rishabh Pant. It is very unfair.""In the second innings, he scored a swashbuckling fifty, earning him a lot of praise. Everyone forgot that first innings and praised him for the second knock,"" Ashwin pointed out.Speaking about Pant's defensive style, Ashwin claimed that he is among the greatest. He also seemed to think that the Indian, along with Steve Smith and Joe Root, is one of the best hitters of the past seven years, during which time batting has become ""significantly difficult and averages have decreased.""""We must realise that Rishabh Pant rarely gets out playing a defence. He's got one of the best defences in world cricket. Defence has become a challenging aspect, he has the best defence with a soft hand.""I have bowled to him a lot in the nets, he's not gotten out, he doesn't get an edge, he doesn't get LBW, he has the best defence. I have tried telling it to him. One opinion about Rishabh was that he plays a lot of shots, he has to fight it out in Test cricket ,"" Ashwin said.""Test cricket is playing according to situation. In the last seven years, batting has become significantly difficult, from 2018 to 2025. But, in the WTC cycle , batting averages have decreased.""Joe Root is in his own zone. Of course, Williamson... Smith has rediscovered again. What we realised is, Rishabh Pant has played in these times.""The 38-year-old Ashiwn, who announced his retirement from international cricket in the middle of the BGT, stated that he will still play cricket.""It was about me as an India cricketer, that's over. But Ashwin as a cricketer is not over yet. I feel that there is still some distance for that.""I feel that I can talk about my personal decision over a period of time. In fact, I want to document my entire story as an Indian cricketer.""","Ravichandran Ashwin believes Rishabh Pant has ""one of the best defences"" in international cricket.

SA20: Durban's Super Giants beat Pretoria Capitals in last-ball thriller,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/sa20-durban-super-giants-beat-pretoria-capitals-in-last-ball-thriller/articleshow/117134948.cms,"Photo Credit: SA20

A 150-plus opening partnership set up Pretoria Capitals (PC) to chase down Durban Super Giants ' (DSG) gigantic total, but they fell agonisingly short by just two runs in an SA20 last-ball thriller at Kingsmead on Friday. Rahmanullah Gurbaz 's blistering 89 off 43 balls, including 7 sixes, and his 154-run opening stand with Will Jacks (64 off 35) laid the foundation required to go past DSG's 209 for 4, but the remaining PC batters couldn't score a mere 56 needed off the last 47 balls with nine wickets in hand.Instead, DSG bowlers held their nerves to stop PC's chase at 207 for 6 in 20 overs for a two-run win in the second match of the season in Durban.After DSG spinner Noor Ahmad broke the stand with the wicket of his Afghanistan teammate Gurbaz in the 13th over, Chris Woakes struck in the next over to remove skipper Rilee Rossouw for just 1.Noor (2 for 34) and Woakes (2 for 42) got another wicket apiece to put pressure back on PC's run-chase, when they sent back Jacks and Senuran Muthusamy (8), respectively, to make it 183 for 4 in 15.5 overs.Big-hitter Liam Livingstone was the Pretoria's best hope to take them home as the equation, 27 runs needed off 25 balls with six wickets in hand, still favouring PC; but the experienced South African spinner and DSG captain Keshav Maharaj removed Livingstone for 13 and Naveen-ul-Haq sent back James Neesham (3) to bring the game on an even keel.With 14 runs needed off the final over, PC batters could hit only one four in the last six balls and fell short of the target by two runs.Earlier, after DSG won the toss and opted to bat, they were given a solid start by openers Bryce Parsons (47) and Matthew Beetzke (33), who stitched together a partnership of 67 runs.Former New Zealand captain Kane Williamson then held the innings together, after Quinton de Kock (15) and Heinrich Klaaasen (0) fell cheaply.All-rounder Wiaan Mulder (45* off 19 balls) then gave Williamson (60* off 40) the support he was looking for, as the duo added a quickfire 91 runs in the last 6.3 overs to take the total past the 200-run mark.Left-arm spinner Muthusamy bowled a crafty spell of left-arm spin to finish with figures of 3 for 21.","Pretoria Capitals (PC) chase down Durban Super Giants'(DSG) gigantic total, but they fell agonisingly short by just two runs in an SA20 last-ball thriller at Kingsmead on Friday.

In a sensational revelation ahead of the Australian Open , the 24-time Grand Slam winner Novak Djokovic has revealed that he was served food that ""poisoned"" him during his short and difficult time in Melbourne in 2022, before his deportation from the country in the Covid vaccine row.""I had some health issues, and I realised that in that hotel in Melbourne, I was fed some food that poisoned me,"" Djokovic said in an interview to GQ magazine.He said traces of lead and mercury were found in his body after that.""I had some discoveries when I came back to Serbia (following deportation). I never told this to anybody publicly, but discovered that I had a really high level of heavy metal. I had lead, a very high level of lead and mercury.""The 37-year-old tennis legend's visa was revoked, and he was ultimately deported from Australia because he declined to receive the Covid vaccination.During his unsuccessful legal challenge to stay in the country, he was confined to an immigration detention facility.Djokovic was asked further in the interview if he believed the food was contaminated. ""That's the only way,"" he replied.GQ's queries from Australia's Department of Home Affairs didn't elicit any response ""for privacy reasons"".However, Djokovic said that he has no ill-feelings against the Australian people. In fact, he returned to Melbourne the following year and won the Australian Open.""A lot of Australian people that I met in Australia the last few years or elsewhere in the world, have come up to me, apologising to me for the treatment I received because they were embarrassed by their own government at that point,"" said Djokovic.""And I think the government's changed, and they reinstated my visa, and I was very grateful for that. I actually love being there, and I think my results are a testament to my sensation of playing tennis and just being in that country.""Never met the people that deported me from that country a few years ago. I don't have a desire to meet with them. If I do one day, that's fine as well.

ICC issues a statement on Champions Trophy, reveals India-Pakistan arrangement

South Africa's Sports Minister, Gayton McKenzie , has publicly advocated for the South African men's cricket team to boycott their upcoming Champions Trophy match against Afghanistan. The tournament is scheduled for next month in Pakistan. McKenzie's call for a boycott stems from his desire to show solidarity with the women of Afghanistan , who have faced significant restrictions on their freedoms and rights since the Taliban regained control in August 2021.McKenzie expressed his support for the boycott, acknowledging the complexities of Afghanistan's history. He feels a moral obligation to advocate for this stance.“Public support for a boycott was ‘a position that I feel morally bound to support, despite the deep complications of Afghanistan’s recent and tragic history’,” Gayton McKenzie stated.McKenzie highlighted the International Cricket Council 's (ICC) stance against political interference in sports administration, noting its apparent inconsistency regarding Afghanistan. He emphasised that the ultimate decision rests not with him, but with the relevant cricketing authorities.“I am aware that the ICC, like most international sporting mother bodies, professes not to tolerate political interference in the administration of sport, despite its obvious inconsistency with Afghanistan.”Also See: ICC Champions Trophy Full Schedule He clarified his personal position, stating his strong opposition to playing against Afghanistan under the current circumstances.“It is not for me as the sports minister to make the final decision on whether South Africa should honour cricketing fixtures against Afghanistan. If it was my decision, then it certainly would not happen.”McKenzie drew a parallel to South Africa's history of apartheid , explaining his stance against discrimination in sports. He stressed the hypocrisy of ignoring the plight of Afghan women while condemning similar injustices faced by South Africans during apartheid.“As a man who comes from a race that was not allowed equal access to sporting opportunities during Apartheid, it would be hypocritical and immoral to look the other way today when the same is being done towards women anywhere in the world.”Peter Hain, a South African-born anti-apartheid activist and member of the UK House of Lords, penned an open letter to Cricket South Africa (CSA) Chief Executive Pholetsi Moseki. The letter, published by Daily Maverick, highlighted the escalating erosion of women's rights in Afghanistan under Taliban rule.“Sport was only the first joy to be removed from women in Afghanistan, and since then the Taliban have removed their most basic human rights and freedoms on a prolific scale.”Hain detailed the extensive restrictions imposed on Afghan women, including limitations on education, employment, healthcare, and even basic freedoms of movement and expression.“Women are denied access to schools and universities, have been barred from most forms of employment and have now been denied all healthcare, as they can no longer train as nurses or be treated by male medics. They are banned from beauty salons, stadiums, gyms and parks, cannot travel alone without a male chaperone, dance, sing or drive. Their faces are banned from view, their voices from being heard, even in prayer. Most recently, the Taliban has banned windows through which women might be glimpsed in their domestic spaces.”Hain appealed to CSA to raise awareness within the ICC about the plight of Afghan women cricketers and to express solidarity with Afghan women and girls who aspire to participate in sports.“Will South African cricket please raise the plight of Afghan women cricketers in the ICC and express firm solidarity with Afghan women and girls who wish to play?”CSA responded with a statement condemning the suppression of women's rights in Afghanistan. They affirmed their commitment to gender equality in cricket.“CSA found ‘the treatment and suppression of women’s rights in Afghanistan abhorrent and firmly believes that women’s cricket deserves equal recognition and resources, an area in which CSA’s record on women’s cricket in South Africa speaks for itself’.”CSA clarified that their stance on Afghanistan's participation in the Champions Trophy would be guided by the ICC's regulations and requirements.“As the Champions Trophy is an ICC event, the position on Afghanistan must be guided by the world body in accordance with international tournament participation requirements and regulations.”CSA President Rihan Richards emphasised the importance of a unified approach from ICC members. He reiterated CSA's commitment to finding a solution that supports women's cricket in Afghanistan and promotes positive change in the country.“We are of the view that a more unified and collective approach from all ICC members will be more impactful. CSA is committed and will continue to engage in constructive dialogue with the ICC and other members to find a solution that upholds women’s cricket in Afghanistan and influences meaningful change in that country.”The Taliban's return to power in August 2021 significantly marginalised women and girls in Afghan society. This drew criticism towards South Africa when they played an ODI series against Afghanistan in Sharjah in September of the following year. Notably, McKenzie, who held his current position at the time, remained silent on the matter.Lawyers for Human Rights, a non-governmental organisation with a long history of fighting oppression, criticised South Africa's decision to play against Afghanistan. They argued that it amounted to an endorsement of the Taliban regime.“South Africa’s decision to continue playing against the Afghanistan national cricket team is not just a sporting choice – it is a tacit endorsement of the Taliban’s repressive regime.”CSA defended their engagement with the Afghanistan Cricket Board, arguing against punishing Afghan cricketers for the actions of the Taliban regime.“CSA believes there is no justification for subjecting Afghan cricket players – both male and female – to secondary persecution for the actions of the Taliban…[CSA will continue] their engagement with the Afghanistan Cricket Board, despite the challenging environment posed by the Taliban regime. Gender advocacy in cricket should never be advanced by meting out punishment on innocent cricket administrators and players for the misdemeanours of a regime that stands to lose nothing from that punishment....”McKenzie's recent statement coincided with the start of the SA20, which includes seven Afghan players.Afghan cricketer Rashid Khan , captain of the MI Cape Town in SA20, spoke about the benefits Afghan cricket has gained from players' participation in T20 leagues, highlighting the learning opportunities and exposure to international competition.“Since our players have been playing in the [T20] leagues, Afghanistan cricket has benefitted. We got to the semi-finals of the [2024] T20 World Cup. Ten years before that, I don’t think anybody would have thought Afghanistan would get to the semi-finals.”Khan emphasised the importance of such leagues for Afghan players, given the lack of a domestic league providing similar opportunities.“We don’t have our own league where we can go and play with superstars. But here you get the opportunity. You share a dressing room with them for a month and you learn from them. That’s how your cricket grows. And I feel that has really helped Afghanistan cricket.”McKenzie's call for a boycott aligns with a similar push by over 160 UK politicians urging England to boycott their Champions Trophy match against Afghanistan.Australia maintains a policy of not engaging in bilateral cricket series with Afghanistan but continues to play against them in international tournaments. They are scheduled to face Afghanistan in Lahore on February 28.South Africa's opening match in the Champions Trophy is against Afghanistan in Karachi on February 21.","South Africa's Sports Minister, Gayton McKenzie, has publicly advocated for the South African men's cricket team to boycott their upcoming Champions Trophy match against Afghanistan.

NEW DELHI: After a rollercoaster start to his Test career, Nathan McSweeney is glad to be back in the Australian side for the upcoming Test series in Sri Lanka, where he hopes to get going after an underwhelming show against India.The youngster, who was dropped from the side after the first three Tests against India was on Thursday recalled for the Lanka series.McSweeney's international debut came in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy series but the 25-year-old managed a lowly 39 runs in three Tests that resulted in his exclusion from the squad for the final two games against India.McSweeney expressed happiness at rejoining the squad, acknowledging the challenging period he's faced recently.""Obviously, it was nice after a chaotic couple of months. It was a bit of nicer call than the last one. I will take heaps of learning from my experiences in my first three Tests and hopefully learn from that if I get the opportunity to play over there I play really well,"" McSweeney was quoted by ICC as saying.McSweeney understands that playing in Sri Lanka presents a considerable challenge, particularly when it comes to facing spin bowling.""It's a great challenge no doubt, but one I have planned for and will be ready for no doubt.

In the last two years, Phil Salt has played 101 T20 games and struck at a staggering 164 strike-rate. It’s easy to have spurts of high strike-rate tournaments, but Salt has done so across countries, continents and competitions, and sustained it over a huge number of games. The Knight Riders signed on Salt as a wildcard pick for this season, with teams being allowed to sign two players from last season onwards even after finalising their squads. There couldn’t be a batter more suited to the name than Salt. Even in a side that has Sunil Narine and Andre Russell, it won’t be a surprise if Salt proves to be the most dynamic bat.Sam Curran has had a relatively quieter few years in T20 cricket since the highs of his Man of the Tournament winning turn in England’s T20 World Cup win a couple of years ago. But he remains a potent force with both bat and ball. The versatility he brings with the bat is something very few T20 players offer. Curran can bat anywhere in the middle order from No.3 to No.7, and he’s even opened the innings a few times. With the likes of Alex Hales and Fakhar Zaman in his team, he probably won’t be needed to open, but it’s a comforting thought for the Vipers that they can send a quick-footed, left-hand batter with a proven track record of performance on the biggest stage. The match-up value and quality Curran provides is alone worth it, and that’s without even considering his bowling.Is there anything he cannot do? Very often the quiet hero, Sikandar Raza got the accolades he richly deserved with a Man of the Tournament show in ILT20 2024. And that was no flash in the pan either. Showing that age is no barrier to growth, Raza has enjoyed a renaissance of sorts. In the last three years, his batting strike rate has jumped to 144, where it was a rather low 124 till the end of 2021. He has played 147 of his 264 T20 games since 2022, during his most fruitful period. Incredibly, his bowling has also improved in that same period, the economy rate going from 7.6 to 7.2, and the average decreasing from 34.8 to 24.3. He’s been scoring more runs considerably quicker, and taking more wickets considerably cheaper. He has all the nous and experience that comes with being 38-years-old, and the fitness and desire of someone a decade younger.Sometimes Shimron Hetmyer goes under the radar. That doesn’t happen when he’s facing up to bowlers though. His talent was evident when he burst onto the scene in 2017, barely out of his teens. Over the years, through ups and downs, Hetmyer seems to have found a natural balance as a batter. He can be a powerful finisher. He can bat up the order if required. He can rotate if the innings needs stabilising. And as a left-hander, he has a natural advantage in the T20 world of match-ups. He played 54 T20 matches in 2024, the most he has played in a single year. For Hetmyer, more means better clearly, because he struck at 148, the highest he has achieved in a calendar year. All in all, he looks primed to carry that blazing form into 2025.It is the most cliched pick perhaps, but it is really difficult to look past Nicholas Pooran. He’s the star for his team as well as the X-factor. He’s the captain as well as the primary match-winner. Among current T20 batters, Pooran doesn’t have any superiors – he has only equals. He is inventive against spin, brutal against pace, can hit sixes to any part of the ground, can accelerate before you blink your eyes, and often seems to need no time at all to get ‘set’. Pooran is gifted with remarkable balance, hands and eyes, and he’s used them to devastating effect in T20 leagues all over the world. He led the way to the title for MI Emirates last year, and it’ll take a brave person to bet against him repeating that triumph.He’s retired from international cricket now, but Tim Southee isn’t leaving cricket. He has led New Zealand in the past, but will be a new captain for the Warriorz. For all those watching their games, it will be a close call between wanting to see Southee the bowler, or Southee the batter. The bowler is blessed with great wrists, and can make life difficult for any opposition, especially at the start of the innings. The batter has deservedly earned the ‘Sixer Southee’ label, because his big hits are almost as remarkable as his outswingers. His team will be eager for both facets to be on full display.","The third edition of the ILT20 is almost upon us. The squads are finalised, the teams are ready, the plans are prepared. Here we pick one player from each side who could be a game-changer during the tournament. Phil Salt, Sam Curran, Sikandar Raza, Shimron Hetmyer, Nicholas Pooran, and Tim Southee.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117123488,imgsize-24462,width-400,resizemode-4/117123488.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Pratika Rawal and Tejal Hasabnis struck impressive half-centuries as India beat Ireland by six wickets in the first Women's ODI in Rajkot on Friday.Rawal played a mature innings, scoring a career-best 89 runs off 96 balls, including 10 fours and a six, anchoring the chase of 239 runs.Hasabnis, returning to ODI cricket after a break, marked her comeback with an unbeaten 53 off just 46 balls that included nine boundaries.Together, Rawal and Hasabnis formed a crucial 116-run partnership that secured India's win with 93 balls remaining.India's stand-in captain, Smriti Mandhana, set the stage for victory with a quickfire 41 off 29 balls.

Maguire cleverly dismissed Rodrigues with a stumping, taking advantage of the batter's adventurous footwork.India lost three wickets for 46 runs during this period, but Mandhana's earlier onslaught had given them a significant advantage.Ireland's inexperience showed as they struggled to capitalize on this opportunity, conceding 21 runs in extras.Earlier in the day, Ireland, choosing to bat first, reached a respectable total of 238 for 7, thanks largely to Gaby Lewis's impressive 92.Ireland were struggling at 56 for 4 in the 14th over, but Lewis and Leah Paul combined for a 117-run partnership, rescuing their team's innings.

Dinesh Karthik makes SA20 debut, praises Joe Root’s impact at Paarl Royals

NEW DELHI: Veteran Indian cricketer Dinesh Karthik has etched his name in history as the first Indian cricketer to take part in the SA20, South Africa's premier T20 tournament.With Paarl Royals gearing up for their season opener against Sunrisers Eastern Cape on Saturday, anticipation is building.The Royals are set to make their first appearance this season, while Sunrisers will look to bounce back from a crushing 97-run defeat in their opening game.Sharing insights on his experience, Dinesh Karthik couldn’t help but gush about the team environment and the legendary Joe Root , his teammate at the Royals.“He (Joe Root) is a very warm person, a good sense of humour, he's a very team guy,” Karthik said. “Just to keep everybody very inclusive and feel very much, you just walk around the dressing room, you'll not realize there's a player who scored 10,000 test runs out there.

MUMBAI: Pace bowler Varun Aaron , who played for India in nine Tests and as many ODIs, in which he took 29 wickets, on Friday announced his retirement from all formats of professional cricket at the age of 35.The Jharkhand fast bowler confirmed his decision through a heart-warming post on social media platform Instagram.“For the past 20 years, I have lived, breathed, and thrived on the rush of bowling fast. Today, with immense gratitude, I officially announce my retirement from representative cricket,” Aaron wrote.On Feb 16 last year, he had already announced his retirement from first-class cricket.Aaron had made headlines by clocking 153 kph during the 2010-11 Vijay Hazare Trophy final against Gujarat, showcasing his raw pace. However, his career was plagued by recurring injuries, and he last played for India in a Test match against South Africa at Bengaluru in November 2015. He regularly played for Jharkhand in domestic cricket, though.""This journey would have been possible without God, my family, friends, teammates, coaches, support staff and fans. Over the years, I've had to push both my physical and mental limits to recover from numerous career-threatening injuries, having to come back time and again. This was possible thanks to the relentless dedication of the physios, trainers, and coaches at the National Cricket Academy. I'd also like to thank the BCCI , JSCA, Red Bull, SG Cricket, and MRF Tyres for their invaluable support during critical junctures in my career,"" he posted.“As I bid farewell to a pursuit that has consumed me completely, I now look forward to savoring the smaller joys in life while staying deeply connected to the game that has given me everything. Fast bowling has been my first love, and though I step off the field, it will always be a part of who I am,” Aaron concluded.Aaron played 52 IPL matches (44 wickets) for various franchises-Delhi Capitals, Royal Challengers Bengaluru, Punjab Kings, Rajasthan Royals, and Gujarat Titans, and also took part in 88 List A games.He took 173 wickets in 66 first-class matches, including six five-wicket hauls.He took a fiver in his last first-class match, against Rajasthan for Jharkhand, in Feb 2024.","Varun Aaron retires from all formats of professional cricket at the age of 35.

NEW DELHI: In a bizarre turn of events at a Big Bash League ( BBL ) game between Sydney Thunder and Hobart Hurricanes on Friday, opener David Warner broke his bat while playing a shot and then went on to hit his head with it.The incident unfolded in the fourth over of the Thunder innings when Warner went hard on a drive off a full length delivery from Hurricanes quick Riley Meredith.As Warner mistimed the shot to mid-off, his bat broke from the handle after the ball made contact with it. The momentum of the bat swing then took Warner's bat back as it hit him on the head.The incident left the commentators in splits as they joked that Warner might need a concussion test after getting hit with his own bat.Despite the freak incident, Warner went on to make a cracking 66-ball unbeaten 88 guiding Thunder to 164 for 6.With 316 runs in 7 innings, Warner is currently the top run scorer in this BBL season.","David Warner broke his bat while playing a shot and then hit his head with it.

When India head coach Gautam Gambhir lost his cool in Australia

NEW DELHI: Spiritual leader Premanand Ji Maharaj praised star India cricketer Virat Kohli for his exceptional contribution to Indian cricket , remarking, “You are spreading happiness in the entire country through your game.”Kohli and his actress wife, Anushka Sharma , recently met Premanand Ji in Vrindavan with their kids, Vamika and Akaay.Premanand Ji also lauded Kohli’s dedication and hard work, emphasising the positive impact his performances have had on millions of fans.Offering words of wisdom, he advised Kohli, ""Aur Abhyaas mein kami nahi honi chahiye"" (there should be no compromise in efforts), stressing the importance of discipline in achieving greatness.Premanand Ji beautifully explained that we both are doing the same thing in our respective fields.""Now, the biggest thing is that we are making people happy through our practice, giving them happiness. And they (Kohli) give happiness to the whole of India through their game. If they win, fireworks are set off across India, and the whole country celebrates. Isn't this their practice too?"" Premanand Ji said.""If they dedicate their victory to God, the whole of India is connected with them. If they achieve victory, every child in India rejoices. So their practice is to stay in their practice, even if it's a game, but the whole of India derives joy from it. If we, for some reason, should focus on the strength of our practice, there should be no lack in our practice, and we should remember the name in between. So this is their practice.""When asked about success and failure Premanand Ji said one has to face the sorrow of defeat despite having perfection.""You will have to face the sorrow of defeat even if your practice is perfect. Destiny sometimes has its role even when practice is not lacking. And if practice is complete together with destiny, then victory is achieved. Sometimes, it is seen that a catch is made; sometimes it is dropped. But destiny also plays a role, and practice too, like among fifteen or twenty.Now, they are very proficient in practice. But this time, destiny is that sorrow has to be endured, so due to the influence of their company, because the whole game will not be from one, your practice will also fail. Practice alone is not enough; destiny is also involved. How should we be in failure? We have to maintain patience while contemplating God at that time. It's very difficult because if someone can smile calmly in failure, it's a big thing. Now, even in failure, embrace it with a smile and move on. God gives that ability. Failure will not always remain. If the day doesn't remain, how can the night remain? We remember God with patience. It's very difficult because the respect received in success is not received in failure.""Premanand Ji praised both Virat and Anushka, saying they are very brave people, as it is very difficult to turn towards devotion even after receiving worldly respect.""The main thing is to chant the name as much as we can, whether sitting or standing, and we will move forward. Both worldly and spiritual progress can be achieved in Kaliyug. If we hold onto the chant, everything will be accomplished. Being dependent on God is the greatest strength. Chant the name, and live with love and joy,"" Premanand Ji concluded.","Premanand Ji Maharaj praised star India cricketer Virat Kohli for his exceptional contribution to Indian cricket. The spiritual leader also lauded Kohli’s dedication and hard work, emphasising the positive impact his performances have had on millions of fans.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117117880,imgsize-68040,width-400,resizemode-4/117117880.jpg"

NEW DELHI: As the new season of the International League T20 ( ILT20 ) approaches, Sharjah Warriorz , led by captain Tim Southee and head coach JP Duminy , are focused on winning crucial moments and maximizing the powerplay overs.The team recognises the importance of understanding the different phases of the game and being able to win them, giving themselves the best chance of success.Duminy emphasized the need to keep things simple during the game and take it one match at a time.He said, “It is crucial to keep things simple during the game. From a tactical point of view, understanding the different phases in the game is important and it is also crucial to be able to win them, so you give yourself the best chance.”“Everyone wants to win the ILT20, but the critical piece will always be the how and that's something that we're going to discuss and understand as we progress in the tournament. It will depend on the conditions are we facing and that'll be an evolving conversation,” the South African explained.Leg-spinner Adil Rashid echoed the sentiment of not looking too far ahead, adding, “Sharjah Warriorz are not going to look too far ahead, and it’s about playing the game that’s in front of you, and executing the plans to perfection. It's a game of cricket and there are ups and downs, so we want to keep things really simple. Whatever challenges lie ahead of us we want to win that battle first and then move onto the next.”Duminy praised the experienced Adil Rashid as a potential match-winner and hopes for consistent performances from the top order batters like Tom Kohler-Cadmore, Johnson Charles , and Jason Roy.“Adil is a very experienced bowler, who understands how to impact the game, and is one of the match-winners for the Sharjah Warriorz. Along with that, I think the top order with Tom Kohler-Cadmore, Johnson Charles and Jason Roy, if they can be consistent, it gives us a great chance to do well too,” the coach said.“Our captain, Tim Southee also brings a wealth of experience into the team and has always done well in the T20 format over the years, and we just hope we can execute our plans well. How do we give ourselves the best chance is the critical question, and how do we ensure we are prepared every single day in training and in matches is going to be the critical piece.""Rashid, who has played over 400 T20 matches in his career, opened up on the importance of playing to his strengths, working on his plans, and keeping things simple.“For me, it is about playing to my strengths and working on my plans, and keeping things simple. What is my role in the team? I'm in the team to try create chances, and hopefully pick up wickets, so I work accordingly.

NEW DELHI: Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta on Friday acknowledged the difficulty of securing impactful January signings to bolster their trophy ambitions as they aim to break a five-year drought.Recent performances, including a 2-0 League Cup semi-final loss to Newcastle and a 1-1 draw against Brighton, highlighted Arsenal's attacking deficiencies.The results have impacted their Premier League title hopes.Winger Bukayo Saka's hamstring injury, requiring surgery and sidelining him until March, further complicates Arteta's attacking options.Arsenal currently trail Premier League leaders Liverpool by six points, with the Reds having a game in hand. However, Arsenal remain well-positioned for Champions League knockout stage progression.Arteta dismissed the notion that simply adding more forwards in January is the solution. He emphasized the importance of acquiring players who can immediately enhance the team's performance.""Bringing in bodies doesn't help us all,"" said Arteta ahead of Sunday's FA Cup third round tie against Manchester United.""It's just about somebody who can immediately impact our performance and can bring something that we don't have. To find that in this market is very difficult to achieve.""The circumstances (can) change because we have certain injuries for some big players, so it's always a possibility but always it's about somebody that is really going to make us much better.""Arteta's post-Newcastle defeat comments about the match ball being ""tricky"" and ""flying differently"" compared to Premier League balls drew widespread ridicule.Arteta clarified that his remarks were not intended as an excuse for Arsenal's missed chances.""It's not an excuse, it's a reality,"" added Arteta.

Chelsea manager Enzo Maresca has announced that Ben Chilwell 's difficult period at Stamford Bridge is approaching its conclusion, with the England defender seeking a transfer during the January window.On Friday, Maresca confirmed that the injury-prone Chilwell would be permitted to depart if suitable terms are agreed in January.The left-back will be absent from Chelsea's FA Cup third round match against Morecambe on Saturday, as Maresca aims to protect the player's prospects of securing a new club.The 28-year-old, having played merely 45 minutes this season, is reportedly considering a move to West Ham, where former Chelsea boss Graham Potter has recently taken charge.Since his arrival from Leicester in 2020, Chilwell has accumulated over 100 appearances for Chelsea, securing a Champions League victory in his inaugural season.However, he has remained unused since Maresca's appointment during the pre-season, with Marc Cucurella being the preferred choice at left-back.Cesare Casadei and Carney Chukwuemeka are also expected to depart and won't participate against League Two outfit Morecambe.""Chilwell is thinking he's going to leave, it's better to avoid using him to avoid injury,"" Maresca told reporters.""Cesare will not be in the squad, same situation as Chilwell. It's best in this moment not to allow him to play in case there's opportunity for him to leave.""Despite limited appearances, Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall, who followed Maresca from Leicester, maintains a position in the club's future plans, according to the manager.Maresca remained non-committal regarding speculation about potential defensive reinforcements from Crystal Palace.Marc Guehi, a Chelsea academy graduate who impressed with England at Euro 2024, is reportedly of interest, whilst recalling Trevoh Chalobah from his Selhurst Park loan remains an option.With Wesley Fofana potentially missing the remainder of the season and Benoit Badiashile sidelined until February, defensive options are limited.""Guehi is a Palace player. I like him, for sure, but he's not our player,"" Maresca said.""I like the central defenders we have, I like different defenders in Italy and France but it does not mean we're going to buy them. When you have an injury the speculation is there.""Trev is a good player but a Palace player.""",Chelsea manager Enzo Maresca confirms that Ben Chilwell will be allowed to leave the club in the January transfer window.

Newcastle boss Eddie Howe remains optimistic about retaining goalkeeper Martin Dubravka at St James' Park after the January transfer window, despite interest from Saudi Pro League club Al Shabab .The 35-year-old Slovak keeper, whose contract expires in six months, has demonstrated exceptional form, allowing only two goals in seven consecutive victories whilst covering for the injured Nick Pope .His performances have helped Newcastle advance in the League Cup and maintain fifth position in the Premier League ""Martin's been in a difficult situation,"" Howe said on Friday. ""Like any player that is coming out of contract in the summer, with every player that I've ever worked with, there's always that feeling of doubt.""He will naturally want some conclusion to his future, whether that's a new contract with us, whatever the outcome. But he's certainly played very well and I've been really pleased with him.""Dubravka's emotional response after Tuesday's Arsenal match, where he appeared tearful, led to speculation about his departure. Since joining Newcastle under Rafael Benitez in January 2018, he has primarily served as backup to Nick Pope, including a stint at Manchester United Regarding Sunday's FA Cup fixture against Bromley, Howe acknowledged Dubravka's connection to the club: ""I know how much Newcastle means to him and you can see that emotionally, he's very invested.""Reports suggest Newcastle's interest in Burnley's England under-21 keeper James Trafford as a potential replacement.When questioned about Pope's position as first-choice goalkeeper, Howe remained non-committal, stating: ""It's always in a state of flux.

Everton ended ties with manager Sean Dyche on Thursday, but it didn't affect their game on the field in the FA Cup third round, where they defeated League One side Peterborough 2-0.However, Everton, while seeking a manager to replace Dyche, find themselves in another relegation battle in the Premier League, having secured just one victory in their previous 11 fixtures, which came against struggling Wolves in December.They have just three victories in 19 league matches so far to be positioned 16th in the table.On Thursday morning, Dyche visited the Everton training facility to bid farewell after his termination, with his column still appearing in the Peterborough match programme.The team against Peterborough was managed by former Everton full-back Leighton Baines, currently the under-18s coach, alongside club captain Seamus Coleman, utilising Dyche's pre-selected starting eleven.Peterborough nearly secured a surprising first-half advantage when Cian Hayes' low shot was cleared from the goal-line by Jarrad Branthwaite.Beto managed to lift the spirits of Everton's quiet supporters in the 42nd minute when he received Harrison Armstrong's pass in the box, went past Peterborough goalkeeper Nicholas Bilokapic and placed the ball into the unguarded net.Everton faced a setback when their Chelsea loanee striker Armando Broja required oxygen and was carried off the pitch with his right ankle heavily bandaged.The anticipated family moment didn't materialise for Everton's Ashley Young, who was introduced late in the match, whilst his son Tyler, a Peterborough player, remained on the bench.In the final moments, Branthwaite was brought down by Jadel Katongo, leading to Iliman Ndiaye successfully converting the penalty, ensuring Everton's victory in their first match following Dyche's departure.",Everton defeated League One side Peterborough 2-0 in the FA Cup third round.

CHENNAI: Chennaiyin FC head coach Owen Coyle has had to be content with a depleted squad for much of the ongoing Indian Super League season and it was no different on Thursday.In what has been a challenging campaign for Chennaiyin, Coyle has had to deal with absence of players at different junctures due to injuries, illness and suspensions. The Scottish manager was forced to field an all-Indian backline for the second successive match as overseas defenders Ryan Edwards and Elsinho were unavailable for selection.While CFC captain Edwards missed out because of a viral infection, Elsinho was not cleared to play, having returned to training after recovering from a nasty head injury. The forced team selection proved to be a blessing in disguise until their absence haunted Chennaiyin in their exciting 2-2 draw with Odisha FC at the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium .Three of the four attack-minded foreign players picked in the XI were actively involved in Chennaiyin’s goals, before the hosts let go of a two-goal advantage at the end. The result was far from ideal for either team, with playoff challengers CFC (10th with 16 points) and OFC (7th with 21 points) staying in the same positions that they started the match at.After an uninspiring first half that was deprived of clear-cut opportunities, the combine of Wilmar Jordan Gil (48th and 53rd minute) and Connor Shields lit up the venue with quick-fire goals. Coyle’s half-time team talk appeared to have worked its magic as the hosts came out all guns blazing post the 15-minute interval.The opening goal arrived after Chennaiyin duly punished an Odisha error. Goalkeeper Amrinder Singh, trying to initiate an attack from the back and find Puitea, played a poor pass and an alert Shields pounced on it. The versatile Scotsman went on a run and put the ball on a platter for Jordan, who made no mistake from close range.The pair combined again a few minutes later. After Daniel Chima Chukwu won a duel with Mourtada Fall close to the halfway line, Shields burst forward on the left and made a simple pass to Jordan. The striker only had Amrinder to beat and did not pass the opportunity.When it seemed like Chennaiyin were on course for a much-needed win, Odisha made the contest interesting 10 minutes from time. Dorielton (80th minute) halved the deficit, seemingly from an off-side position that went unnoticed by the linesman, after substitute Diego Mauricio delivered a killer strike.Then, in the eighth minute of stoppage time, the tourists broke CFC hearts and rescued a point. Rahul KP’s shot from a bicycle-kick took a double deflection – the second being a wicked one – as it went in after hitting goalkeeper Mohammad Nawaz.","Chennaiyin FC draw 2-2 with Odisha FC at the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium.

Jude Bellingham and Rodrygo did the scoring duties as Real Madrid secured am emphatic 3-0 win over Real Mallorca on Thursday to set up a mouth-watering 'Clasico' Spanish Super Cup final against archrivals Barcelona.With strong support from the crowd in Jeddah, Madrid opened scoring through Bellingham's precise finish after the first half, as Martin Valjent's own goal in stoppage time extended their lead, followed by Rodrygo's close-range finish to seal the scoreline.Real Madrid dominated the initial phase against the previous season's Copa del Rey finalists, with both Lucas Vazquez and Rodrygo nearly scoring in the first few minutes, and Kylian Mbappe seeking a penalty decision after contact with Dani Rodriguez.Under Jagoba Arrasate's guidance, Mallorca established themselves defensively and successfully limited the Spanish and European champions' attacking opportunities throughout the first half.Real Madrid faced a setback when Aurelien Tchouameni left the pitch early in the second half following a head collision with Cyle Larin, although he later confirmed he had not sustained any injury.Real Madrid found their breakthrough in the 63rd minute via Bellingham, following unsuccessful attempts by Rodrygo and Mbappe that were thwarted by both the woodwork and Mallorca's keeper Dominik Greif.The decisive moment came from a swift Madrid attack when Vinicius Junior's cross found Rodrygo, whose header struck the post, followed by Mbappe's shot being saved by the alert Greif.Bellingham demonstrated his clinical finishing ability by calmly guiding the loose ball past the defenders stationed on the goal-line, further extending his impressive scoring streak.Despite Vinicius and Mbappe having a subdued performance compared to their usual standards, their involvement in the first goal demonstrated the team's attacking prowess.Real Madrid's second strike was an own-goal gift from Valjent, who inadvertently directed the ball into his net whilst attempting to intercept a pass, leaving Mallorca with a mountain to climb.The match concluded with tensions flaring between both sides, particularly involving Mallorca defender Pablo Maffeo and Madrid's Raul Asencio, who engaged in a heated exchange.Rodrygo sealed the victory in the closing stages, ensuring Madrid's progression to face their rivals from last year's final.",Real Madrid beat Real Mallorca 3-0 in the Spanish Super Cup in Jeddah.

The skies are blue and the sun is unapologetically brazen, not uncommon in the Antipodes this time of the year. Melbourne Park , the sprawling grounds of the Happy Slam, overlooks the Yarra, gliding gently alongside a shimmering carpet.The Australian Open , starting Sunday, is held far from the ructions of a world in a twirl, but even thousands of aeronautical miles isn’t quite far enough for tennis, struggling to move forward from issues of the past year. Ostensibly, a pair of gold standard 23-year-olds, World No. 1 Jannik Sinner and five-time major winner Iga Swiatek , returned positive tests that rocked the core of the game.Sinner, the Australian Open’s defending champion tested positive for clostebol last March. An independent panel, which was presented the case by the International Tennis Integrity Agency, ruled there was ‘no fault or negligence’ on the part of the Italian.The verdict that Sinner bore no fault didn’t sit well with the World Anti-Doping Agency , who in the era of XXL entourages, harps on independent thinking, especially with all that athletes put in their system. Not even a billionth of a gram.WADA has appealed to the Court of Arbitration for Sport and the Italian faces a potential ban of up to two years. The hearing could be slated for February after the conclusion of the first major of the year, but there could be appeals at a higher port, the Swiss Tribunal.Swiatek, the four-time Roland Garros champion, tested positive for trimetazidine in August. The sleep medication she was taking was contaminated.Tennis couldn’t have imagined a darker quandary in the New Year, given that the younger generation of champions had served notice of a new order last season.Sinner and Swiatek, who’ve been careful about everything they put in their body, came out with resilient masks on Media Day on Friday, saying, not much has changed for them.“I’ve done the same thing,” Sinner said. “Before I was very, very careful with every single medicine I took, even what I eat. When the bottle is open, I throw it away, I take a new one.”Swiatek, the four-time Roland Garros champion, who is playing down under with a new coach Belgian Wim Fissette, said, “The contaminated thing was a medication, and medications are treated as tested and clean. The weirdest thing is that the contamination level was ok by Polish pharmaceutical law, but it's not okay in our doping law.”Nick Kyrgios, who has unequivocally taken aim at Sinner, has stopped at nothing – personal or professional.“Having two number ones implicated in doping is abhorrent for our sport,” Kyrgios told reporters in Brisbane. “Right now the state of tennis integrity is widely acknowledged to be terrible – no one seems willing to address it, but it truly is unacceptable. We owe it to the sport to be vocal about it.”The volatile Aussie is backed by Djokovic, going for a historic 25th major title at Melbourne Park, and will open his campaign for a record-equalling 11th Australian Open crown against Indian-American Nishesh Basavareddy.The 37-year-old said, “I'm questioning the way the system works, why certain players are not treated the same as other players.”Interestingly, Sinner, who starts his campaign on Tuesday against Nicolas Jarry, who had tested positive for Lindanrol and Stanozolal and was suspended from the Tour for ten months from January 2020. He was subsequently cleared as the ITF ruled that Jarry ‘bore no significant fault or negligence for his violation’.Sinner, who wore his unruly crown and a blank expression like a model on a catwalk, didn’t give much away.“I haven't done anything wrong, that's why I'm still here,” the world No.1 said. “I don't want to respond to what Nick said or what other players say. The most important part is to have my people around me, they know exactly what happened.”Djokovic’s glittering trophy cabinet should serve as an example for Sinner. The Serb, not really a fan favourite, especially in a cast that included rockstar figures Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal, channelled his energies into winning, Grand Slam after Grand Slam, owning record after record, silencing raging crowds with his inner steel. In doing so he delivered a message that said, love means nothing in tennis, titles are everything.Sinner wouldn’t want to be known only as a two-time major winner, and Swiatek, a five-time champion, the shine and sparkle of silverware could wipe the smudge off their names. Melbourne Park is as good a place as any to get that going again.","World No. 1 Jannik Sinner and five-time major winner Iga Swiatek return positive tests.

Iga Swiatek opened up about the challenging experience of her recent doping ban. She spoke about the emotional toll it took on her ahead of the Australian Open.Swiatek withdrew from the WTA 's Asian swing in September, initially citing ""personal matters.""It was later revealed that her absence was due to a one-month suspension for a positive doping test. The banned substance was a heart medication.Swiatek maintains she unknowingly ingested the substance through contaminated non-prescription medication.“Trust me, I was the one that was the most surprised.”Swiatek described the initial weeks following the news as a period of uncertainty and distress.“I had no idea what's going to happen. The first three weeks, I would say, were pretty chaotic. I had no idea if my suspension was going to be lifted soon or not.”She candidly shared the emotional impact of the situation.“It was probably the worst time in my life.”Swiatek expressed her frustration with the lack of control she felt.“And the fact that I had no control over this whole situation and I had no chance to avoid it made it even worse because I'm a control freak a little bit.”Following the ban, Swiatek returned to competitive play at the United Cup . She secured four consecutive singles victories before losing to Coco Gauff in the final.“I think it was great preparation before the first Slam.”Swiatek expressed confidence in her game leading into the Australian Open.“I think the quality of my game was also really nice.

Jannik Sinner claims innocence as ATP head confirms doping investigation follows protocol,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/top-stories/jannik-sinner-claims-innocence-as-atp-head-confirms-doping-investigation-follows-protocol/articleshow/117106067.cms,"Jannik Sinner (AP Photo)

Top-ranked tennis player Jannik Sinner addressed doping allegations on Friday, asserting his innocence while ATP chairman Andrea Gaudenzi affirmed the integrity of the process.Sinner, currently world number one, tested positive twice for the steroid clostebol in March.The International Tennis Integrity Agency (ITIA) cleared Sinner, accepting his explanation that the substance entered his system through a contaminated spray used by his physiotherapist.However, the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) appealed the ITIA's decision to the Court of Arbitration for Sport, leaving Sinner awaiting a final verdict and a potential suspension.Sinner maintained his innocence, emphasizing his meticulous approach to medications and nutrition.“When the bottle is open, I throw it away, I take a new one,” he explained, highlighting his caution.He reiterated his confidence in his actions.“In my mind I know exactly what happened, and that’s how I block it (out).”He affirmed his innocence and determination to continue playing.“I haven’t done anything wrong, that’s why I’m still here. That’s why I’m still playing.”Despite his focus on the upcoming Australian Open, where he faces a challenging first-round match against Nicolas Jarry , Sinner admitted the situation weighs on his mind.“You think about this, of course,” he acknowledged.He admitted the ongoing nature of the situation.“I would lie if I would tell you I forget.”He described the persistent nature of the issue.“It’s something what I have with me now already for quite a long time. But it is what is. I’m here trying to prepare the Grand Slam. Let’s see how it goes.”Sinner stated he had no further information on the WADA appeal's timeline.“I know exactly as much as you guys know.”He emphasized the lack of clarity on the situation.“We are in a stage where we don’t know many, many things.” Novak Djokovic recently called for increased transparency in tennis doping cases, suggesting potential disparities in treatment based on player ranking.Gaudenzi refuted these claims in an interview with the Australian Associated Press, emphasizing the proper handling of Sinner's case.“I genuinely believe there has been a lot of misinformation out there, which is unfortunate,” Gaudenzi stated, dismissing inaccuracies in reporting.He affirmed the impartiality of the process.“I am 100 percent sure that there has not been any preferential treatment. The process has been run by the book and according to the rules, by the ITIA.”While Djokovic expressed belief in Sinner's contamination explanation, he also criticized the lack of transparency throughout the process.Gaudenzi, however, stated he was only informed about the case shortly before the ITIA's announcement, emphasizing the independent nature of the investigation.“I initially was a bit shocked. (But) it is completely independent and they obviously went to an independent panel.”Gaudenzi urged patience while the process unfolds, expressing confidence in the sport's resilience even if Sinner faces a ban.“If that is the case, I think he’ll survive and I think we’ll survive. Overall, tennis is a very strong product,” he concluded, highlighting the enduring strength of the sport.","Top-ranked tennis player Jannik Sinner addressed doping allegations on Friday.

Coco Gauff participated in a mixed doubles exhibition at Rod Laver Arena a few days before the Australian Open . It was a lighthearted event for fun and charity. During the match, Gauff playfully announced her target serve speeds, getting closer to 200 kph (125 mph).After winning a game with her partner Andrey Rublev, Hall of Famer Lleyton Hewitt complimented her serving.“Great serving.”“Thanks. I've been working on it.”Gauff has been diligently working on her serve and forehand. These improvements position her as a potential challenger to two-time defending champion Aryna Sabalenka at the Australian Open.“It would be great to come home with the Australian Open trophy. But I think I've just learned to not put so much pressure on events, and just put pressure on development and how I'm playing. That takes the pressure off.”Gauff aims to focus on her development rather than the pressure of the event. She reflects on her semifinal loss to Sabalenka last year.“I mean, yeah, making the semis last year and losing to Aryna, the eventual champion - I feel like I can get there and cross that line.”Her first opponent will be fellow American Sofia Kenin , the 2020 Australian Open champion.

Daly complements Faurel's coaching, focusing on the technical aspects while Faurel concentrates on footwork and shot selection.“It's just been a great combo. JC has brought me a lot of footwork and shot selection in my game. And Matt has helped me with the technical side of things - my serve, specifically, and other things, as well.”Gauff expressed gratitude for her coaches' smooth transition and their combined efforts.""It's just a good combination that we have. I'm very thankful for them to make the transition as easy as possible, especially considering it is two people.""Five-time Slam champion Iga Swiatek recently lost to Gauff in the WTA Finals and the United Cup final.

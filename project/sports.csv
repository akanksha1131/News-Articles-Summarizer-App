Curious case! Why Ajit Agarkar & Co. continue to ignore Ishan Kishan

NEW DELHI: India all-rounder Hardik Pandya on Friday lit up the 5th T20I against South Africa with a powerful innings and an emotional celebration that quickly caught everyone’s attention.He smashed India’s second-fastest T20I fifty and then celebrated by blowing flying kisses towards his girlfriend, Mahieka Sharma, who was present in the stands.The match was played at the Narendra Modi Stadium, where Hardik walked in to bat at No. 5 after captain Suryakumar Yadav was dismissed early.Having recently returned from a quadriceps injury, there were questions about his rhythm, but Hardik answered them in style.He reached his half-century in just 16 balls, making it the second-fastest T20I fifty by an Indian.As soon as he got to the milestone with a big six, Hardik turned towards the VIP stands and blew flying kisses in Mahieka’s direction.She was seen cheering loudly and smiling, clearly enjoying the moment. The gesture was caught on camera and soon went viral on social media.Watch:Hardik’s innings was full of clean hitting. He attacked the South African bowlers from the start and cleared the boundary with ease.One of his lofted shots was hit so hard that it accidentally struck a cameraman near the boundary, underlining the force behind his strokes.He stitched an important partnership with Tilak Varma, who also played a steady innings and scored a fifty of his own. Together, they pushed India to a massive total of 231 for 5, putting the hosts firmly in control of the match.With this knock, Hardik went past Abhishek Sharma’s 17-ball fifty to move into second place on the list of fastest T20I fifties by Indians.Only Yuvraj Singh’s iconic 12-ball fifty from the 2007 T20 World Cup remains ahead of him.The celebration also carried a personal touch. After his public split from Natasa Stankovic in 2024, Hardik has been more open about his life off the field.","India all-rounder Hardik Pandya scores second-fastest T20I fifty by an Indian.

Debate invariably rages whenever an Indian team is picked, especially when it is for a marquee event like the T20 World Cup. The nation splits into camps, some celebrating the inclusion of their favourites in the final 15, others lamenting the omission of players they believe deserved a spot.The change of guard after 2024 brought results on the field but it also ensured the debates off it never truly went away. Among the key talking points is whether the selectors should disturb the settled opening combination of Abhishek Sharma and Sanju Samson by bringing Shubman Gill back into the mix. Questions have also been raised over team balance — do India really need so many allrounders or should a proven finisher be added instead?For the selectors, it is a tightrope walk. Whatever combination they settle on, some one is bound to be unhappy. So when the Ajit Agarkar-led selection panel meets at the BCCI headquarters on Saturday to pick the squad for the home edition of the T20I World Cup, which kicks off on Feb 7, 2026, they will carefully weigh the pros and cons before announcing the final list.While the form of skipper Suryakumar Yadav and his deputy Gill remains a concern, don’t expect the panel to rock the boat so close to the tournament. The squad for the New Zealand T20Is will also be named and it is expected to mirror the World Cup squad, giving the out-of-form duo time to rediscover their touch.The key focus of the meeting is likely to be on backups in case of injuries. Yashasvi Jaiswal is a strong contender to step into the top three if required, especially with Gill having dealt with a neck injury earlier and now a toe issue. Jaiswal, who strikes at around 165 in T20s, has been knocking on the door after impressive performances for Rajasthan Royals and Mumbai.Meanwhile, Ishan Kishan, ignored since the 2023 South Africa tour, forced his way back into contention with a prolific Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy, scoring 517 runs, including a century in the final, at a strike rate of 197 to guide Jharkhand to the title.Also in the mix is Sanju Samson, the second-choice wicketkeeper, who scored three T20I centuries in 2024 before being displaced from the opening slot. Coach Gautam Gambhir’s preference for batting depth is reflected in a middle and lower-middle order stacked with allrounders, while Tilak Varma’s place also appears secure.","The T20 World Cup kicks off on Feb 7, 2026.

Curious case! Why Ajit Agarkar & Co. continue to ignore Ishan Kishan

Hardik Pandya successfully slipped into beast mode for seven overs at the Narendra Modi Stadium on Friday night, with the 80,000-strong crowd lapping up every bit of his pyrotechnics.With exactly 50 days to go for the T20 World Cup at home, India are sweating over the form of their captain Suryakumar Yadav and his deputy Shubman Gill.Instead, it was Pandya (63; 25b, 5x6, 5x4), Tilak Varma (73; 42b, 10x4, 1x6), Varun Chakravarthy (4-43 in four overs) and Jasprit Bumrah (2-17 in four overs) who produced inspirational performances to shape the Men in Blue’s 30-run win in the fifth and final T20I against South Africa.The 3-1 triumph in the T20I series, coming on the back of the 2-1 victory in the ODIs, rounded off a fine comeback by India in the white-ball leg of the series after losing the Tests 0-2.With Shivam Dube (10 not out off five balls, 1x6, 1x4) also joining the party, India raced away to 231 for five after being asked to bat first by SA. The visitors tried hard but finished at 201 for eight, with Quinton de Kock (65; 35b, 9x4, 3x6) top-scoring for them.Walking in to bat in the 13th over, Pandya, looking in a murderous mood, stepped out and smashed the first ball he faced, from Proteas pacer Corbin Bosch, for a six over mid-off, in what was clearly a ‘statement hit’. The ball struck the camera man stationed near the Indian dugout on his arm and he needed medical treatment.It was a sign of what Pandya, returning to the side in this series after a quadriceps injury kept him out since Sept end, was to unleash on the night. Pandya tore into South Africa’s bowlers with his blistering strokeplay. The Mumbai Indians captain smashed a 16-ball half-century, the second fastest ever for India in T20Is after Yuvraj Singh’s famous 12-ball blitzkrieg against England in the 2007 World Cup.Hammering five sixes and an equal number of fours in a highly entertaining 25-ball 63, Pandya, who blew kisses to his girl friend Maheika Sharma after reaching his breathtaking half century and received a standing ovation from head coach Gautam Gambhir, made India forget all their T20 troubles.By the time he was finally dismissed in the final over, India’s premier white-ball allrounder had put on 105 in just 44 balls for the fourth wicket with Tilak, who was also in a destructive mode.The left-hander complemented his Mumbai Indians captain’s raw power with elegant stroke play. With Surya continuing to fail — the skipper was out for a seven-ball five this time, caught at mid-off by David Miller off Corbin Bosch — Tilak now seems a certainty to bat at No. 3 in the World Cup.",India beat South Africa by 30 runs in the fifth and final T20I. Hardik Pandya (63) and Tilak Varma (73) were the stars of the show.

Sun sets on Suryakumar’s year

NEW DELHI: Captain Suryakumar Yadav’s poor run with the bat continued, but India still piled up a big 231 for 5 in the fifth and final T20 International here on Saturday, riding on half-centuries from Tilak Varma and Hardik Pandya and a useful contribution from Sanju Samson at the top.Sanju Samson, who opened the innings in place of injured vice-captain Shubman Gill, scored 37 off 22 balls and added 63 runs with Abhishek Sharma (34 off 21 balls) as India, leading the series 2-1, got off to a flying start.The dismissals of Abhishek and Samson did not slow India down. Tilak Varma (73 off 42 balls) continued to bat in the same manner, while Suryakumar Yadav departed for 5 without making an impact.Varma and Hardik Pandya (63 off 25 balls) then put together a 115-run partnership for the fourth wicket to take India past the 200-run mark. Pandya struck five boundaries and five sixes during his innings.It was another difficult outing for India’s T20I captain. Suryakumar walked in with India well placed but managed only 5 off 7 balls during his stay at the crease. With that, he finished the 2025 calendar year without scoring a single fifty in T20 Internationals.Suryakumar ends 2025 with 218 runs from 19 T20I innings, averaging 13.62 with a strike rate of 123.16.He did not register a half-century during the year.While much of the discussion around India’s batting has focused on the opening spot and the competition between Shubman Gill and Sanju Samson, Suryakumar’s struggles have drawn less attention. Gill, too, has endured a difficult year, failing to score a fifty in any of his 15 T20I innings in 2025.Suryakumar’s position as captain and his past record in T20 cricket could work in his favour, while Gill faces competition from Samson. All three are expected to be part of India’s T20 World Cup squad.However, if India are to defend their T20 World Cup title, they will need improved returns from their captain with the bat.",Suryakumar Yadav's poor run with the bat continues. India piled up 231 for 5 in the fifth and final T20 International. Tilak Varma and Hardik Pandya both scored half-centuries.

Second-fastest T20I fifty for India



It took Hardik Pandya one ball to announce himself in Ahmedabad. The bat came down in a full arc, the ball went up and over, and somewhere beyond the rope a cameraman found himself part of the moment. Ahmedabad had barely settled when Pandya, walking in mid-innings, turned the fifth T20I on Friday into a reminder of how quickly a game can change when he decides to intervene.Walking in during the 13th over, the all-rounder hit a six off his first ball, which also struck a cameraman standing at long-off.Pandya came in after India captain Suryakumar Yadav was dismissed for five off seven balls on the first delivery of the 13th over.

AHMEDABAD: Former India captain Rohit Sharma will feature in the first two matches for Mumbai in the upcoming Vijay Hazare Trophy. However, India's T20 captain Suryakumar Yadav , opener Yashasvi Jaiswal, and all-rounder Shivam Dube have not been included in Mumbai's squad for the domestic One-Day tournament. The team will be captained by all-rounder Shardul Thakur The group stage of VHT will be held between Dec 24, 2025 and January 8, 2026. Mumbai have been placed in Elite Group C, alongside Sikkim, Uttarakhand, Chhattisgarh, Himachal, Maharashtra, Punjab, and Goa, and will play their matches in Jaipur.""Rohit will play in Mumbai's first two matches of the tournament (against Sikkim on Dec 24, and against Uttarakhand on Dec 26, at Jaipur),"" a source in the Mumbai Cricket Association told TOI on Friday. The BCCI has made it mandatory for all current national team players to turn up in at least two matches of the Vijay Hazare Trophy, unless a player is injured or recovering from injury at CoE. Earlier, it emerged that former India captain Virat Kohli too will turn out in VHT for Delhi.""All the India players will be accommodated in the Mumbai squad as and when they are available,"" Mumbai's senior selection committee chairman Sanjay Patil told this paper, after his panel picked the squad for the tournament on Friday. Also present in the selection meeting was former India skipper Dilip Vengsarkar, currently the MCA's men's cricket advisor.Jaiswal, India's Test and ODI opener, was hospitalized in Pune after suffering from a bout of acute gastroenteritis after Mumbai's last match in the Syed Mushtaq Ali T20 Trophy against Rajasthan.""He will be included in the Mumbai squad once he gets clearance from the medical team,"" Patil said.India play their next international series starting with the three-match ODI series against New Zealand from Jan 11, 2026 in Vadodara.Meanwhile, it's learnt that former India and Mumbai captain Ajinkya Rahane has asked to be rested from the initial matches Mumbai team in the league stage of the tournament. ""He has got a hamstring issue, and will rest and recover. He will join the Mumbai team after the first couple of matches,"" Patil said.The selectors have given a maiden call-up to opener Ishan Mulchandani. Young batter Angkrish Raghuvanshi, who managed to score just 49 runs in four matches@16.33 in the recently-held Syed Mushtaq Ali T20 Trophy, was lucky to survive the axe. Prolific domestic batter Sarfaraz Khan, who was in sizzling form in SMAT, hammering 329 runs in seven matches at an average of 65.80 and a strike rate of 203.80, including three fifties and a century, is apart of the squad, and so is his younger brother, allrounder Musheer Khan.Though Mumbai failed to defend their SMAT title, failing to advance beyond the Super League Stage, Patil was quite pleased with the team's performance in the T20 tournament. ""I'm quite happy with our performance. We won eight out of our 10 matches, which means that we played some good cricket. Everyone played well, especially Sarfaraz Khan. It's just that we suffered badly due to the Net Run Rate Rule,"" Patil said. Mumbai won two out of their three matches in the Super League stage, but crashed out as their NRR was inferior to the other teams.According to the rules of the tournament, the NRR was counted from scratch for the Super League. And, after three Super League games, if multiple teams were on equal points, then instead of looking at the head-to-head figures, the NRR was taken into consideration.","Former India captain Rohit Sharma will feature in the first two matches for Mumbai in the upcoming Vijay Hazare Trophy.

A trophy with a meaning

The hollow in a million hearts

A new trophy, a new start

A forgotten memory

NEW DELHI: Looking back today, it feels almost unreal that the original FIFA World Cup trophy no longer exists.In an era where constant digital tracking and tight security were absent, football lost one of its most treasured symbols quietly and permanently. The Jules Rimet Trophy, which crowned the world champions of football for four decades, was stolen in 1983 and never recovered.The Jules Rimet Trophy was the first official World Cup prize. It was awarded to the winners of the FIFA World Cup from 1930 to 1970. Named after Jules Rimet, the former FIFA president who played a key role in starting the World Cup, the trophy carried enormous historical value.It was made of solid gold and featured a sculpted figure holding a cup, making it instantly recognisable to fans across the world.For Brazil, the trophy had special meaning.The country first won the World Cup in 1958 and defended the title in 1962. Brazil won the tournament in 1970 for the third time, completing a remarkable journey.At the time, it was under FIFA rules that any country that won the World Cup three times was allowed to keep the Jules Rimet Trophy permanently.Led by football legend Pelé, Brazil’s victory in 1970 gave the nation permanent ownership of the trophy.After the celebrations ended, the Jules Rimet Trophy was placed at the headquarters of the Brazilian Football Confederation in Rio de Janeiro.It was displayed in a glass case and treated as a symbol of Brazil’s football greatness. Security arrangements were modest, reflecting a time when the idea of stealing such an object seemed unlikely.That sense of safety did not last.In December 1983, the Jules Rimet Trophy was stolen. It all happened under the night skies when thieves broke into the CBF building. They damaged the display case and took the trophy.When officials arrived later, they found that the most famous prize in football history was gone.News of the theft reached the ears of the general public soon across Brazil and beyond. In a country where football makes people fanatics, the loss was deeply felt.The trophy was not only the representation of their success on the pitch, but it also stood for generations of players and moments that shaped the sport.Brazilian police launched an investigation immediately. Over time, several suspects were arrested, including a jeweller. Investigators worked to trace the trophy and understand the motive behind the theft. Their findings pointed to a simple but devastating conclusion. The Jules Rimet Trophy was made of solid gold, and gold could be melted.According to the investigation, the trophy was melted down and sold as gold. This conclusion was based on police evidence and statements from those involved.Once melted, the trophy lost its identity completely. No markings, shapes or features remained. Not a single piece of the original Jules Rimet Trophy has ever been recovered.This was not the first time the trophy had been stolen. In 1966, ahead of the World Cup in England, the Jules Rimet Trophy disappeared from an exhibition in London.In an interesting end to the saga, the trophy was found wrapped in newspaper under a hedge by a dog named Pickles.It was soon returned safely, and the incident became part of football folklore.The 1983 theft in Brazil had no such ending.With no hope of recovery, Brazil later commissioned a replica of the Jules Rimet Trophy. The replica was placed on display to preserve the memory of Brazil’s achievement.However, it could not replace the historical value of the original trophy that had been lifted by champions from 1930 onwards.The disappearance of the Jules Rimet Trophy also influenced how football treated its prizes.After Brazil’s third World Cup win, FIFA introduced a new trophy, first awarded in 1974. The current FIFA World Cup Trophy is not permanently awarded to any nation. Winners lift the original trophy during celebrations but are later given a replica to keep. The original remains under FIFA’s control.The loss of the Jules Rimet Trophy forced FIFA to look at this rule with a strict eye.For Brazil, the theft was especially painful.The 1970 team is widely considered one of the greatest sides in football history. Players like Pelé, Jairzinho, Rivelino and others created moments that will forever be in the memories of the fans.The trophy they earned through skill and success on the field was lost through negligence and crime.The story continues to be remembered even after decades.Authorities believe they know what happened to the trophy. Yet, the sense of loss remains because the outcome cannot be reversed.Football history was erased in physical form.Today, fans can only see photographs and replicas of the Jules Rimet Trophy. Museums display its likeness, and books recount its journey. But the original, which once travelled across continents and crowned the first world champions, no longer exists.The stolen World Cup trophy stands as a reminder of a different era. It shows how even the most valuable symbols can be lost if they are not protected. It also highlights how fragile history can be.Football has moved forward since then. New trophies have been lifted, new legends have emerged, and new memories have been created. Yet the story of the Jules Rimet Trophy remains one of the sport’s most sobering chapters.It is a throwback to a time when the World Cup could disappear. And never return.","The Jules Rimet Trophy was the first official World Cup prize. It was awarded to the winners of the FIFA World Cup from 1930 to 1970. For Brazil, the trophy had special meaning.

NEW DELHI: Indian Super League (ISL) clubs on Friday formally proposed a fundamental restructuring of the country's top-tier professional football league, seeking perpetual operational and commercial rights for a club-owned league model while retaining the All India Football Federation (AIFF) as the sport's regulator.The proposal was submitted on the final day of the deadline given to ISL clubs to present a plan for the formation of a consortium to run the league, the 2025-26 season of which is yet to commence.""...we write to formally place before the All India Football Federation (AIFF), and the Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports (Ministry), a detailed proposal for restructuring the ownership, governance, and operational framework of India's top-tier professional football league,"" the clubs said in a joint letter addressed to the Sports Ministry and AIFF.""This proposal is guided by the shared objective of safeguarding continuity of elite football in India, strengthening institutional governance, ensuring long-term financial sustainability of the league, aligning with globally accepted best practices, and enabling AIFF to focus more effectively on its core mandate of regulation, governance, grassroots development, and national team excellence.""The proposal comes amid uncertainty surrounding Indian football, with governance challenges, the expiry of commercial agreements and ongoing proceedings before the Supreme Court concerning amendments to the AIFF constitution.The clubs proposed that ""AIFF grant the rights to operate, manage, and commercially exploit India's top-tier professional football league to a dedicated league company (League Company) in perpetuity, subject to continued compliance with AIFF, AFC, and FIFA statutes and regulations.""""The League Company shall be structured such that: The participating Clubs shall collectively hold a permanent majority shareholding;

Engage with the Ministry as outlined above; and Constitute a joint working group comprising representatives of AIFF, Ministry and the Clubs to address legal, regulatory, and transitional matters, including timelines and approvals from AFC, FIFA, and the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India.""Representatives of all ISL clubs have been invited to attend the upcoming AIFF Annual General Meeting on Saturday, where the matter is expected to be discussed.","Indian Super League (ISL) clubs formally propose a fundamental restructuring of the country's top-tier professional football league.

At least 59 people, including seven police officers, were injured after violent clashes erupted between rival football supporters following Colombia’s Copa Colombia final in Medellin on Wednesday night, authorities said, in scenes that overshadowed Atletico Nacional’s title triumph.The unrest broke out moments after the final whistle at the Atanasio Girardot Stadium, where Atletico Nacional edged past city rivals Deportivo Independiente Medellin 1-0 to lift the trophy. What should have been a night of celebration quickly descended into chaos as fans from both sides stormed the pitch, hurled projectiles and clashed with security forces.Videos of the violence circulated widely on social media, showing dozens of supporters invading the field and confrontations breaking out in different sections of the stadium. Riot police were forced to intervene to restore order as the situation spiralled out of control in front of a crowd of around 43,000 spectators.Medellin’s security secretary Manuel Villa confirmed that 52 fans were treated for injuries sustained during the clashes, while police said seven officers were also hurt. No arrests were reported, but Villa said authorities were reviewing CCTV footage from inside and around the stadium to identify those responsible.The violence had immediate consequences for the event, with officials cancelling the post-match trophy presentation and medal ceremony for Atletico Nacional players due to safety concerns.In Colombia, visiting fans are typically barred from attending high-risk fixtures to prevent crowd trouble. However, Medellin city hall had allowed Atletico Nacional supporters — officially designated as the visiting side — to attend the final as part of an initiative to promote peaceful coexistence in football.Medellin mayor Federico Gutierrez strongly condemned the incidents, describing those involved as “criminals” and “misfits” who do not represent the sport.","At least 59 people, including seven police officers, were injured after violent clashes erupted following Colombia’s Copa Colombia final.

PARIS: Paris Saint-Germain goalkeeper Matvey Safonov has been left with a fractured hand following his penalty shootout heroics to win the Intercontinental Cup.Safonov made four straight penalty saves as PSG beat Brazil's Flamengo 2-1 in the shootout on Wednesday to secure the club's first global title. He was thrown in the air by his teammates during the celebrations.PSG said Friday that Safonov has a fracture in his left hand and that “his situation will be re-evaluated” after three or four weeks.“I can’t explain anything, it’s incredible. The player doesn’t know how it happened,” coach Luis Enrique said in translated comments Friday.He added that the most plausible explanation seemed to be that Safonov was hurt during the shootout and kept playing with the fracture.In a video posted on social media app Telegram, Safonov didn't address what happened directly, but said: “You know, no matter what happens, I can't be broken.”Safonov, PSG’s Russian backup goalkeeper, hadn’t played a single minute for the team until summer signing Lucas Chevalier sustained an ankle injury which has ruled him out since his last game Nov. 29.Chevalier was on the bench against Flamengo.

NEW DELHI: The Indian Super League (ISL) clubs were on Thursday asked to submit a proposal for forming a consortium to run the 2025-26 season of the league, which is yet to begin.Representatives of all ISL clubs were invited to attend the Annual General Meeting of the All India Football Federation on Saturday, on the sidelines of which the matter was discussed.“Regarding the consortium thing, the clubs have been told to submit to the ministry their proposal so that it can be discussed during the Dec 20 AGM. But there is no guarantee,” a club representative told news agency PTI.The request followed a virtual meeting on Thursday between AIFF officials, ISL club representatives and the sports ministry. The clubs were asked to submit their proposal by Friday evening.The AIFF also informed the clubs that, under its new constitution, any amendment to its provisions could be done only after the General Body of the national federation was formed according to the new constitution itself.“It could be hotchpotch also since the new National Sports Grievance Act is likely to be implemented shortly. So there can be changes under the Act also,” a source in the know of things said.Meanwhile, the Indian Women’s League, starting December 20, will be held without a sponsor after the AIFF and Capri Sports – the lone bidder in the national federation’s tender to monetise the commercial rights of the first and second divisions of the IWL for five years – could not reach an agreement.The clubs had earlier suggested forming a consortium to resolve the ongoing commercial impasse in Indian football.The AIFF said this would require deliberations and approval by its Executive Committee and the AGM.The Marketing Rights Agreement between the AIFF and Football Sports Development Limited, which organised the ISL for 12 seasons since its inception in 2014, ended on December 8, leaving the top-tier league without a commercial framework.","Indian Super League (ISL) clubs were on Thursday asked to submit a proposal for forming a consortium to run the 2025-26 season of the league, which is yet to begin.

NEW DELHI: Today is December 18. For some, it is just another day on the way to Christmas and the New Year. For football fans, however, it is a date that will forever live in the sport’s collective memory as the night Lionel Messi completed the game.Under the bright lights of Lusail Stadium in Qatar three years back, Argentina defeated France in a final that felt less like a match and more like destiny unfolding in real time.For Messi, it was not just a World Cup title; it was the closing chapter of a lifelong pursuit that had defined his career, his country, and an entire generation of football fans.For nearly two decades, Messi’s greatness had been measured against an absence.He had won everything at club level, from Champions League to multiple Ballon d’Ors, league titles and goal-scoring records that once seemed untouchable.And yet, the World Cup remained the one prize that eluded him, the yardstick by which football immortality is often judged.In Argentina, where Diego Maradona ’s shadow still loomed large, that absence was felt more sharply than anywhere else.Qatar 2022 began with doubt rather than certainty. Argentina’s shocking opening defeat to Saudi Arabia threatened to derail the campaign before it truly began.For a brief moment, old fears resurfaced: was this another World Cup destined to end in heartbreak for Messi?But what followed was a team and a captain refusing to surrender to narrative or pressure.Messi led with calm authority. He scored, he created, he inspired, and, perhaps most importantly, he believed.From the group stages to the knockout rounds, Argentina grew stronger with each game, feeding off Messi’s composure and clarity. Against Australia, the Netherlands, and Croatia, he was not just a playmaker but the emotional compass of the side, guiding younger teammates through moments of chaos and tension.Then came the final: Argentina versus France, Messi versus Kylian Mbappé, experience versus explosive youth. It was billed as a passing-of-the-torch moment, but Messi was not ready to hand anything over.He scored from the penalty spot to give Argentina the lead and later added a second, arriving in the box with perfect timing to finish off a flowing move. At 2–0, it seemed as though the dream was finally within reach.Football, however, rarely allows fairy tales to unfold without resistance. In a breathtaking twist, Mbappé struck twice in the space of minutes to drag France back into the contest.Extra time followed, and Messi once again stepped up, poking the ball home to make it 3–2. Still, France refused to yield. Mbappé completed his hat-trick from the penalty spot, forcing a shootout that felt almost unbearable in its tension.As penalties loomed, the weight of history hung heavy. Argentina had been here before. It was close, but not close enough. This time, though, the script was different.Emiliano Martínez produced heroics in goal, Argentine penalties were struck with conviction, and when Gonzalo Montiel converted the decisive kick, Messi dropped to his knees, overcome with emotion.Tears flowed freely.Teammates swarmed him. In that moment, the burden he had carried for so long seemed to lift. The image of Messi, draped in the black bisht as he raised the World Cup trophy, became instantly iconic.For Argentina, the victory healed old wounds. It united generations that had debated Messi’s place in the pantheon and finally allowed him to be celebrated without caveats.For Messi himself, it was redemption, validation, and closure all at once.He had not just won a World Cup; he had done so as the undisputed leader of the team, delivering when it mattered most.Two years on, the significance of that night has only grown.December 18 is no longer just a date on the football calendar. It is the day Lionel Messi stepped beyond comparison, beyond debate, and into footballing eternity; World Cup in hand, legacy complete.","Lionel Messi won the FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022 trophy on December 18, 2013.

Congress member Jose K Mani raised India's football future in the Rajya Sabha on Thursday, comparing India's struggles with tiny Curacao's World Cup qualification while questioning Sports Minister Mansukh Mandaviya about plans to develop the sport in India, which is currently facing significant challenges including the suspension of domestic leagues.Mani, representing Kerala, highlighted how Curacao, with just 158,000 people and an area under 450km, qualified for next year's FIFA World Cup through CONCACAF, while India, despite its billion-plus population, continues to struggle.""Qualifying for FIFA world cup is based on the criteria laid down by FIFA, international governing body for football sport discipline,"" Mandaviya responded to Mani's queries.""Responsibility for development of a specific sports including taking steps for participation in World Cup/World Championships is that of concerned National Sports Federation (NSF). All India Football Federation (AIFF) has been recognised by the ministry as the NSF for the promotion and development of the football sport discipline in the country. AIFF has informed that it has a long term plan to help India qualify for FIFA World Cup, with a focus on both the men's and women's national team,"" he added.The AIFF, currently led by Kalyan Chaubey, faces a major crisis as it struggles to secure a commercial partner for domestic leagues, which have been suspended. This situation has led to Supreme Court intervention following criticism of the federation's management.Mandaviya outlined AIFF's youth development initiatives, noting the establishment of FIFA-AIFF academies in Bhubaneswar and Hyderabad for under-13 boys and under-14 girls.""In addition, through the Khelo India Asmita League, the AIFF organised Girls' football competitions, conducting 87 leagues & 68 leagues, across the country, during 2023-24 and 2024-25 season, respectively,"" Mandaviya said.When questioned about the government's Khelo India Scheme progress, Mandaviya provided specific numbers demonstrating its reach.""A total of 28214 athletes have been trained at Khelo India Centres across the country as of April 2024 under Khelo India scheme. A total of 991 Khelo India Centres are operational across the country,"" he stated.The discussion highlighted the stark contrast between India's football performance and smaller nations like Curacao, while also showcasing the government's efforts to develop sports infrastructure through various initiatives.","Congress member Jose K Mani raised India's football future in the Rajya Sabha on Thursday.

Indian football faces administrative paralysis

Amid unprecedented uncertainty in Indian football, the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) on Wednesday handed a triple blow to Mohun Bagan Super Giant, imposing a continental ban and fines totaling USD 100,729 (approximately INR 91 lakh) after the club withdrew from the 2025-26 AFC Champions League Two.The AFC Disciplinary and Ethics Committee ruled that the reigning Indian Super League champions wrongfully withdrew from the competition following their refusal to travel to Iran for a group-stage match against Sepahan SC. Mohun Bagan was handed a one-season ban from AFC competitions.In Decision VVC 20251217DC21, the committee found the Kolkata-based club guilty of breaching Article 5 (Withdrawal from the Competition) of the ACL Two Competition Regulations after failing to fulfil its fixture once the group stage had begun.As part of the sanctions, the Mariners were ""fined USD 50,000,"" ordered to pay ""USD 50,729 as compensation for damages and losses"" claimed by the AFC and Sepahan SC, and ""disqualified from participating in the next AFC club competition for which they would otherwise qualify, with the ban remaining effective up to and including the 2027–28 season.""The committee also ruled that Mohun Bagan would forfeit all subsidies linked to their participation in the 2025-26 ACL Two season, including participation fees, performance bonuses, and travel subsidies.Any amount already paid must be repaid within 30 days.""The compensation shall be paid to the AFC within thirty (30) days of the date that this Decision is communicated,"" the order stated.Terming the decision ""biased,"" a Mohun Bagan official told PTI that the matter is pending at the Lausanne-based Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS), and they are ""hoping for a resolution.""""It's a biased decision against our club; our matter is pending at CAS and we're hopeful of a resolution. However, the club may pay up the fines,"" he added.The ruling comes after Mohun Bagan cited player safety concerns, as six foreign players declined the trip to Iran following advisories from their governments. The club had requested a venue change and later approached CAS, but the AFC deemed it a withdrawal, triggering strict disciplinary action. The case mirrors the previous season, when Mohun Bagan similarly did not travel to Iran to face Tractor SC but had escaped sanction.In Decision VVC 20251217DC08, the AFC Disciplinary and Ethics Committee fined the All India Football Federation (AIFF) USD 1,000 for delaying the restart of the second half during India’s AFC Asian Cup 2027 final-round qualifier against Bangladesh on November 18, 2025.The committee found that AIFF representatives caused a delay of one minute and 43 seconds in commencing the second half, breaching Article 2 (Official Countdown) of the AFC Competitions Operations Manual. The AIFF was ordered to settle the fine within 30 days, under Article 11.3 of the AFC Disciplinary and Ethics Code.In another ruling (VVC 20251217DC19), the AFC fined FC Goa USD 5,000 for failing to ensure stadium safety during their ACL Two group-stage match against Saudi Arabia’s Al Nassr on October 22.The committee found the club violated Article 64 (Organization of Matches) of the AFC Disciplinary and Ethics Code after a spectator invaded the area surrounding the field of play. The ruling noted that FC Goa failed to fully comply with safety regulations and did not take all precautions required to maintain law and order. The fine must be paid within 30 days of communication.The AFC’s disciplinary actions come at a time when Indian football is grappling with deep structural and administrative uncertainty. The domestic season remains in limbo, with no confirmation on the ISL, I-League, or I-League 2 following the expiry of the 15-year agreement between Football Sports Development Limited (FSDL) and the AIFF on December 8.The ISL usually starts in September, while the I-League was scheduled to begin on October 19. With the impasse continuing, the Union Sports Ministry, led by Minister of Youth Affairs and Sports Dr Mansukh Mandaviya, has stepped in to hold meetings with all stakeholders to prevent a complete collapse of the domestic calendar.A proposed resolution is expected within the next week, as officials race against time amid fears that India could go without a men’s domestic league season for the first time since 1996—a scenario that would further damage the country’s standing in Asian football.","Mohun Bagan handed a continental ban and fines totaling USD 100,729 (approximately INR 91 lakh) The Kolkata-based club withdrew from the 2025-26 AFC Champions League Two.

In a dramatic NFC West clash, the Los Angeles Rams saw a 16-point fourth-quarter lead slip away, falling 38-37 in overtime to the Seattle Seahawks. The defeat stings not just because of the loss itself, but because it jeopardizes the Rams’ shot at the NFC’s top playoff seed. Fans and analysts alike were stunned by the way Seattle clawed back. Quarterback Matthew Stafford was sensational, throwing for 457 yards and three touchdowns with no interceptions, yet even his brilliance couldn’t secure victory.Emotions ran high after the game, as the spotlight turned to the referees whose calls in overtime raised eyebrows across social media. The moment in question involved former Rams star Cooper Kupp making a sideline catch, prompting the female official behind the play to show unusually visible enthusiasm. The officiating on the field, combined with a blown dead two-point conversion and an illegal man downfield, drew sharp criticism from the Rams’ camp and beyond.Rams receiver Puka Nacua ignited social media by slamming the refs on X, though he later deleted the post and was fined $25,000 by the league. Matthew Stafford’s wife, Kelly, added fuel to the fire with a pointed post: “Never seen refs get this excited about a catch? 🤔 Now the blown dead two-point conversion and illegal man downfield makes sense.Should we be looking into this? Can I get these refs’ names?” She later admitted to feeling “petty” about calling out the officials, yet her remarks captured the frustration of many Rams supporters.Despite the controversy, the Rams must confront their own shortcomings. Blowing a 16-point lead in the fourth quarter is a rarity and now places their playoff destiny in the hands of other teams. The Seahawks could still win out and claim the No. 1 seed, as could the San Francisco 49ers, leaving Los Angeles needing several outcomes to break their way to secure a bye. Still, the spotlight will linger on that overtime sequence and the officials’ role, leaving fans debating whether it was skill, luck, or officiating that determined this unforgettable clash.Also Read: Amid Puka Nacua controversy, ex-girlfriend Hallie sparks buzz online with bold selfie that grabs attention","The Los Angeles Rams lost 38-37 in overtime to the Seattle Seahawks.

Taylor Swift reveals Travis Kelce’s Eras Tour cameo began as a joke that unexpectedly turned into pure onstage magic,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/taylor-swift-reveals-travis-kelces-eras-tour-cameo-began-as-a-joke-that-unexpectedly-turned-into-pure-onstage-magic/articleshow/126087139.cms,"Taylor Swift opens up on Travis Kelce’s Eras Tour cameo (Getty Images)

When Taylor Swift brought out Travis Kelce on stage during her Eras Tour show



When the lights flared across London’s Wembley Stadium last June, no one expected a playful backstage joke to turn into one of the Eras Tour’s most talked about moments. The crowd sensed something unusual, the kind of pause that carries promise. What followed was not just a cameo, but a glimpse into how spontaneity can still thrive inside a tightly choreographed global tour.That night later gained new meaning with the release of Taylor Swift ’s Disney+ docuseries The End of an Era. In its fourth episode, Swift pulls back the curtain on how a casual laugh between her and Travis Kelce evolved into a bold onstage appearance that stunned fans and set social media ablaze.Speaking candidly in the episode, Swift explains the idea was never meant to leave the realm of humor. “How do I put this? Travis is like… He’s a real… He’s a real yes guy, like in terms of life itself,” the singer shares. “He’s just up for anything.” That openness, she reveals, became the quiet spark behind the moment.The skit tied to “I Can Do It with a Broken Heart” had already been mapped out. Swift played a wounded soldier who suddenly springs back to life, a theatrical beat meant to mirror emotional resilience. As she worked through the scene, a thought crossed her mind.“I remember thinking about the skit and always just being like, ‘If there was ever a point to put Travis in the show, I think this would be the one,’ but obviously I’m never gonna suggest that because that’s like… You don’t wanna scare people, you know?” she says.The suggestion surfaced naturally during a lighthearted exchange. Swift recalls, “I can’t remember how it came up. I think we were just joking around about him doing it, him getting up there with Kam.” The joke quickly shifted tone. “And it became very clear that he, like, wasn’t joking.” When Swift offered to loop in wardrobe, Kelce’s answer was instant. “Put me in. I’m in.”On stage, Kelce delivered with confidence. Swift later praised how he shines under pressure. “I think that's, as a player, he can slow down time in the most stressful moments, and that’s exactly what we saw on stage,” she says. “He got out there and was the most charming, delightful performer you could ever be on the stage with. His instincts — he’s just so magically entertaining.”Andrea Swift noticed the effect on the crowd, saying Kelce “brought a lot of happiness” to fans. Swift agreed, adding, “I can safely say, that was the loudest it ever got on the Eras Tour.”Dressed in a tuxedo and top hat, Kelce filled in during an outfit change, danced with ease, and exited with a grin. What began as a joke ended as a defining tour memory, one born from trust, timing, and a shared willingness to say yes.Also Read: Will Travis Kelce retire after the 2025 season?

Tom Brady's ex Gisele Bündchen marries Joaquim Valente in hush-hush ceremony,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/tom-bradys-ex-gisele-bndchen-marries-joaquim-valente-in-hush-hush-ceremony/articleshow/126087092.cms,"Gisele Bündchen secretly marries Joaquim Valente (Getty Images)

Gisele Bündchen and Joaquim Valente are husband and wife



Tom Brady's ex Gisele Bündchen is married for the second time. She has spent much of her public life under a microscope, yet the most meaningful moments of her past year unfolded quietly. Away from flashing cameras and carefully curated posts, the supermodel chose intimacy over spectacle. That choice now defines a new chapter that blends family, commitment, and calm after years of headline driven chaos. What mattered most happened at home, surrounded by people who knew long before the world did.The shift feels deliberate. Bündchen, long associated with global runways and stadium sized attention, has leaned into a more grounded rhythm. Love, motherhood, and privacy have taken center stage. The latest confirmation simply puts a name to what insiders already understood. Life has moved forward, steadily and on her own terms.Gisele Bündchen and Joaquim Valente are husband and wife, and the timing says as much as the setting. TMZ confirmed the couple tied the knot earlier this month at their Surfside, Florida home, following the issuance of a marriage license on Dec.1 and a wedding date of Dec. 3. Page Six first reported the marriage, noting it was a small gathering attended by close family and friends. While there was no public announcement, sources were clear that it was not hidden from those closest to them.Valente, a jiu-jitsu instructor, has reportedly embraced this milestone with joy. As one insider put it, “He is thrilled they finally tied the knot after having a kid together.” The couple welcomed a baby boy earlier this year, a life changing moment that reshaped their priorities. Bündchen has remained protective of that space, even as she recently returned to Brazil for a high profile Vivara jewelry event in São Paulo, where her ring finger was notably obscured.This marriage marks Bündchen’s second. Her first, to NFL legend Tom Brady, ended in October 2022 after 13 years. Together, they share son Benjamin and daughter Vivian. Brady was informed about Bündchen’s pregnancy with Valente, though it remains unclear whether he knew about the wedding beforehand. At the time, Brady reportedly “never imagined” his ex wife would have children with Valente.The early days of Bündchen and Valente’s relationship drew speculation, especially given their connection through jiu-jitsu training that began in 2021. Bündchen has firmly denied any overlap, stating, “That is a lie,” when addressing cheating rumors in a 2024 interview with The New York Times.Taken together, the past year reflects quiet resolve. Marriage, a new child, and a redefined sense of peace suggest that for Bündchen, this was not about headlines. It was about building something lasting, away from the noise.Also Read: Is Tom Brady dating Brooks Nader?

Chiefs urged to sign $40 million quarterback as insurance plan behind Patrick Mahomes ahead of crucial NFL seasons,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/chiefs-urged-to-sign-40-million-quarterback-as-insurance-plan-behind-patrick-mahomes-ahead-of-crucial-nfl-seasons/articleshow/126086985.cms,"Patrick Mahomes (Getty Images)

Kansas City Chiefs could find value in Justin Fields as Mahomes insurance



The Kansas City Chiefs are facing a rare moment of uncertainty. With Patrick Mahomes sidelined after knee surgery, the franchise that has defined consistency for a decade is suddenly forced to think short term and long term at once. The rest of the 2025 season may drift by quietly, but the decisions made now will echo into next fall.Mahomes is attacking his rehab with trademark intensity, yet the added complexity of an LCL injury changes the math. Kansas City cannot simply assume he will be ready to go in Week 1 at full strength. That reality pushes the Chiefs into uncomfortable territory. They need stability without panic, insurance without overspending, and a quarterback who can win games if asked to carry the offense for a stretch.Gardner Minshew remains a familiar name in the building, but his contract status and ceiling complicate matters. The Chiefs are not looking to survive. They are built to contend every year. That is why the idea floated by The Athletic’s Jeff Howe has gained quiet traction around the league.“Fields should seek out the Kansas City Chiefs, [Indianapolis] Colts or [Minnesota] Vikings,” Howe wrote. “Whether or not Patrick Mahomes (torn ACL) will be ready for Week 1, Fields could do a lot worse than Andy Reid’s offense for a spell.”Justin Fields represents a blend of upside and affordability that fits Kansas City’s current reality. At 27, he is young enough to grow yet experienced enough to step in without overwhelming the roster. He would not arrive as a savior. He would arrive as a solution. Andy Reid’s system has a long track record of simplifying reads, leaning into strengths, and protecting quarterbacks from themselves.Howe also framed Fields’ career crossroads clearly. “The 2021 first-round pick has also lost his job with the Chicago Bears and [Pittsburgh] Steelers, so Fields will likely be demoted from bridge quarterback to backup,” he wrote. “But if he focuses on the right system and coaching staff for his development, Fields could still have a chance somewhere down the line.”The numbers show both promise and flaws. Fields has topped 9,000 passing yards with more than 50 touchdowns, while adding nearly 3,000 rushing yards at an elite clip for a quarterback. What he has lacked is structure and patience around him. Kansas City can offer both.Financially, the fit matters just as much. Fields will have earned close to $49 million once the Jets settle his guaranteed money. That positions him for a short, modest deal rather than a market reset. For a Chiefs team already staring at a heavy cap burden in 2026, that flexibility is vital.The Chiefs do not need a star. They need a steady hand who can keep the engine running until their franchise quarterback is ready. In Justin Fields, they may find exactly that, without compromising the future they are protecting.Also Read: Will Travis Kelce retire after the 2025 season?

(Getty Images)

Travis Kelce keeps focus on finishing strong despite uncertain future



The Kansas City Chiefs are closing a season no one in the locker room imagined back in August. Losses piled up. Injuries reshaped the depth chart. Hope faded faster than expected. Yet inside that quiet stretch of disappointment, Travis Kelce has narrowed his vision instead of letting the noise take over. With three games left, his attention is fixed on the huddle, not headlines about retirement or contracts.This moment feels different for Kelce because it carries an ending he can see coming. The usual uncertainty that fuels late-season football is gone. Still, he has chosen purpose over speculation. In a year stripped of playoff pressure, the veteran tight end is leaning into leadership, presence, and accountability. For him, finishing strong is not optional. It is personal.When Kelce finally addressed reporters, his message was clear and measured. He did not dodge the future, but he refused to let it dominate the present.“I’d rather keep the focus of the media and everything on this team right now,” Kelce said at a press conference on Friday. “All the conversations I have with the team and everything moving forward will be with them.I think it’s a unique time in my life. Unfortunately, I’ve got three games left, and I know when the season ends this year. Typically, we go into it, and we don’t know when it’s going to end, and that’s the beauty of it. Just trying to make sure that everybody here knows that I’m focused on trying to win football games, these last three games.”The timing makes his stance even more striking. Kansas City has already been eliminated from playoff contention. Patrick Mahomes is rehabbing after ACL surgery. For the first time since 2014, the postseason will move on without the Chiefs. Kelce, now a free agent after the 2025 season, has acknowledged he will decide his future by early March. For now, that decision stays on hold.He repeated the sentiment later, reinforcing where his priorities stand.“I’d rather just keep the focus of the media on this team right now,” Kelce said. “All the conversations I have with the team and everything moving forward will be with them. It’s a unique time in my life. Unfortunately I’ve got three games left and I know when the season ends this year.”Despite the circumstances, Kelce is not dialing it back. His numbers show steady production, but his mindset reveals something deeper.“It’s just integrity. I signed up to be a Kansas City Chief. I love doing what I do,” he said. “I’ve been dreaming of these moments and playing for an NFL team since I was a kid. That’s just how you need to go about work, whether you’re in the race or not. I’m going to make sure these guys know I’m giving everything I’ve got.”For Kelce, legacy is built in how you finish, not how loudly you exit.Also Read: Taylor Swift’s risqué “Wood” lyric about Travis Kelce explodes online, ranking among Genius’ most viewed of 2025","Travis Kelce says he will decide his future by early March.

She said those experiences shaped The Tortured Poets Department and left her disillusioned with dating. Swift later found stability with Travis Kelce, whom she says understands her world in a way past partners did.

Taylor Swift reflects on heartbreak, healing, and why Travis Kelce changed everything before their engagement

Before Taylor Swift became engaged to Kansas City Chiefs star Travis Kelce, she quietly navigated one of the most emotionally turbulent stretches of her personal life. In 2023, just as her record-breaking Eras Tour was about to launch, Swift experienced two painful breakups that forced her to confront long-standing feelings about love, visibility, and trust.Instead of retreating, she leaned into her work, using the tour not just as a professional milestone but as emotional armor. That period of vulnerability would ultimately shape her music, her outlook on relationships, and her appreciation for stability, setting the stage for a connection that felt fundamentally different when Kelce entered her life.Taylor Swift candidly addressed that chapter in Episode 4 of The End of an Era, offering one of her most unfiltered relationship reflections to date. “Men will let you down,” she said. “The ‘Eras Tour’ never will.” The comment wasn’t flippant, it reflected a deep sense of disillusionment following back-to-back breakups, first from longtime partner Joe Alwyn and then from a brief romance with Matty Healy.That emotional fallout poured directly into her creative process. “Tortured Poets album is like this purge of just everything, everything bad that I felt for two years,” Swift explained.She described feeling reduced to a public concept rather than a person, adding, “Feeling like I'm not a person, I'm just this big conglomerate that no one sees as a really human being, especially not men that I date.” The album became less about bitterness and more about reclaiming agency.What changed with Kelce, according to Swift, wasn’t grand gestures but mutual understanding. She emphasized that their similar work lives, both shaped by relentless schedules, scrutiny, and pressure, allowed them to see each other clearly, without distortion. That shared rhythm appears to have grounded their relationship in ways past ones couldn’t.Now, as Swift intentionally slows down wedding planning and focuses on home life while Kelce balances an NFL season, the contrast is striking. The woman who once found refuge only in her work now seems comfortable building something lasting alongside it proof that timing, not just chemistry, can redefine love.Also Read; “She looks exactly like Joe”: Fans compare Taylor Swift’s look to Joe Alwyn amid her engagement to Travis Kelce","Taylor Swift revealed that two painful breakups in 2023 deeply affected her.

Dak Prescott’s net worth, contracts, and why 2025 changed his financial standing

Christmas 2025, family time, and what Dak Prescott has actually said about the holidays

Dak Prescott is closing out 2025 as one of the highest-paid athletes in sports, even as the Dallas Cowboys fall short of postseason expectations. The contrast is sharp. On one side is a quarterback coming off another statistically heavy season. On the other is a public figure whose wealth, family life, and off-field presence continue to grow.With Christmas approaching, fans are asking two things. How much is Prescott really worth right now, and how does he spend the holidays when football does not end the way he wants it to?Prescott’s net worth is estimated at $90 million in 2025, according to Celebrity Net Worth. That figure places him among the top earners in NFL history and reflects more than just quarterback contracts.The foundation of that wealth is his four-year, $240 Million extension, signed ahead of the 2024 season. The deal includes an $80 Million signing bonus and $231 Million guaranteed, giving Prescott the highest average annual salary in league history at $60 Million per year at the time of signing.In 2025, Prescott is 32 years old and still under contract through the 2028 season. His 2025 cap hit sits at $50.518 Million, with higher hits scheduled in later years.The structure gives Dallas flexibility now while committing long-term money to its franchise quarterback.Off the field, Prescott’s income is just as significant. Forbes ranked him No. 4 on its Highest-Paid NFL Players list for 2025 and No. 4 among the World’s Highest-Paid Athletes. His endorsement portfolio includes AT&T, Nike, Beats, Lowe’s, Panini, Sony, Topps, and Dick’s Sporting Goods, among others.He also owns stakes in multiple business ventures, including Walk-On’s Sports Bistreaux locations in Texas, GLOW Beverages, OxeFit, and RealTruck. These are not vanity investments. They reflect long-term income streams beyond football.Prescott also lives in a 9,016-square-foot mansion in Prosper, Texas, built on more than seven acres. The home includes a sports simulator, media room, and private pond. It is where he spends most of his off-field time during the season.There are no confirmed vacation plans for Prescott this Christmas, and anything beyond that would be speculation. What is clear is how he typically approaches the holidays.Prescott has consistently tied Christmas to family, presence, and giving back, not travel. Through his Faith. Fight. Finish. Foundation, he has spent multiple holiday seasons supporting children in North Texas. In December 2025, his foundation teamed up with Raising Cane’s to provide 50 bikes and helmets to local students as part of a Christmas event.Prescott explained why those moments matter to him. “Maybe that’s gonna be this for some of these kids,” Prescott said, reflecting on giving bikes to children.He also spoke directly about what the holidays mean to him as a parent. “I think just the presence that one can give somebody else is as good enough as a present as anything can be,” Prescott said.Prescott is engaged to Sarah Jane, whom he proposed to in October 2024. The couple welcomed their second child, Aurora Rayne Prescott, in May 2025. Their daughter turned six months old in November, and Sarah Jane shared photos of the milestone on Instagram.Prescott has not publicly stated where he will spend Christmas 2025, but based on past behavior and his own words, the expectation is time at home with family rather than a public vacation. That aligns with how he has handled the holidays for years.","Dak Prescott’s net worth is estimated at $90 million in 2025, according to Celebrity Net Worth.

The unexpected question caught Nader off guard and revived talk of their alleged 2024 summer fling. Nader’s playful dating comments and personal revelations only fueled renewed online curiosity.

Andy Cohen reignites Tom Brady dating rumors with bold on-air question to Brooks Nader

For Andy Cohen, live television has never been a place for soft landings. The Watch What Happens Live host thrives on moments that blur the line between playful curiosity and outright provocation, and his latest interview delivered exactly that. During a recent episode, Cohen casually revived long-simmering rumors linking NFL icon Tom Brady to Sports Illustrated Swimsuit model Brooks Nader.The exchange felt unscripted, slightly awkward, and unmistakably intentional. While neither Brady nor Nader has ever confirmed a romance, Cohen’s willingness to go there turned a fading rumor into fresh headline fuel, reminding viewers that celebrity narratives rarely stay buried for long.The moment unfolded as Cohen chatted with Nader and fellow guest Erika Jayne. With a grin, he noted, “Well you both dated guys named Tom.” When confusion flickered across the set, Cohen quickly clarified that he meant Tom Brady, not Jayne’s disgraced ex-husband, Tom Girardi. The directness caught Nader off guard, dragging her rumored 2024 summer fling with the seven-time Super Bowl champion back into the spotlight.At the time, reports suggested Brady and Nader were “casually hooking up,” though neither ever addressed it publicly. Since then, both have moved through highly visible life changes. Brady settled into his second season as a Fox Sports analyst after finalizing his divorce from Gisele Bündchen in 2022. Nader, meanwhile, ended her five-year marriage in 2024 and later split from Dancing With the Stars partner Gleb Savchenko earlier this year.Nader didn’t stop making headlines during the episode. She joked about rejecting an unnamed celebrity suitor, saying, “It’s not about turning them down, it’s just, maybe they were too old and ugly in that moment,” before adding, “…they might have been Oscar Award winning multiple times. Not ugly, just not my type.” She also shared her father’s humorous rule: “My dad has a rule that's, ‘Please don't let your next husband be older than me,’ because he's only 50. ”Whether Cohen accidentally reignited something real or simply stirred curiosity, the result was the same: renewed fascination with Brady and Nader. In the celebrity world, sometimes one question is all it takes to bring a rumor roaring back to life.Also Read: Gisele Bündchen opened up about feeling “so blessed” while embracing life after divorce from Tom Brady","Andy Cohen casually revived long-simmering rumors linking Tom Brady to Brooks Nader.

Molly Qerim has finally resurfaced, and so the fashion battle is always on our minds any time her "" First Take "" replacement flexes a fantastic fit



Molly Qerim’s absence from the daily sports debate left a noticeable silence on television, but it also created space for curiosity. Fans were not only wondering where her career would head next, they were also watching closely to see who could step into a role that mixed sharp moderation with undeniable style. “First Take” has always been more than arguments and hot takes. It is also a visual stage, and fashion has quietly become part of its identity.With Qerim stepping away after contract talks took a dramatic turn, ESPN turned to Shae Cornette. Filling that seat meant handling pressure from day one. It meant holding your own next to Stephen A. Smith. It also meant knowing that every outfit would be compared, dissected, and debated online. Cornette has handled that spotlight with patience, easing into the role while letting her personality grow naturally.Cornette recently reminded viewers that style still matters on the set. In an Instagram carousel captioned “The last few weeks ✨,” she opened with a mirror selfie in a sleeveless black dress. The look was simple, confident, and intentional. It did not scream for attention, but it made its point. Before diving into family moments, she quietly established that she has a fashion voice of her own.Meanwhile, Qerim has begun to reappear in her own way. After keeping a low profile, aside from a thoughtful fireside chat at UConn with Dan Hurley, she returned to Instagram with glimpses of an Abu Dhabi trip for the season-ending Formula 1 race. The posts feel calculated and calm, signaling a shift toward influence and personal branding rather than studio debate.The contrast between the two women feels less like competition and more like evolution. Cornette, now 39, is growing comfortable in the chair, balancing television demands with life as a mother of three. Her recent photos leaned into that reality, celebrating her children while still carving out space for style.Qerim’s exit from ESPN was controversial, but it also freed her to redefine success on her own terms. With familiar faces like Elle Duncan moving on to new platforms, the sports media world is clearly changing. What remains constant is this. Whether on camera or online, presence still matters. And right now, both women are finding fresh ways to command it.Also Read: Matthew Stafford’s MVP push with the Rams could silence critics and fast-track his Hall of Fame destiny","Molly Qerim’s absence from the daily sports debate left a noticeable silence on television.

“It’s quite hard”: Michael Irvin details the emotional challenges of being his wife’s caregiver for over a decade,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/its-quite-hard-michael-irvin-details-the-emotional-challenges-of-being-his-wifes-caregiver-for-over-a-decade/articleshow/126077098.cms,"Michael Irvin reflected on caring for his wife, Sandy Harrell, for nearly a decade after early signs of early-onset Alzheimer’s appeared. Speaking on Club Shay Shay, he described the emotional, physical, and financial demands of 24-hour care, challenges with in-home nurses, and his unwavering commitment to keeping her at home despite the toll on their family.

Inside Michael Irvin’s life as a full-time caregiver long before the diagnosis went public

Long before Michael Irvin publicly shared his wife’s diagnosis, the Hall of Fame wide receiver was already living inside a reality few see and even fewer understand. Nearly a decade ago, subtle changes began to surface in Sandy Harrell, the woman he met in college and married in 1990. At first, the shifts were easy to misread, especially in a household already familiar with Alzheimer’s disease.What followed was years of uncertainty, medical tests, emotional recalibration, and an evolving sense of responsibility that reshaped Irvin’s life far beyond football. Speaking openly about the experience years later, Irvin offered a rare, unfiltered look at the emotional labor, financial strain, and unwavering commitment that define long-term caregiving when the diagnosis comes far too early.Appearing on Club Shay Shay, Irvin explained that the warning signs emerged roughly ten years before doctors confirmed early-onset Alzheimer’s. “We recognize some things were going wrong with her about 10 years ago, actually,” he told Shannon Sharpe.Given their family history, the possibility loomed, but the initial assumption was menopause. “I buried my mom. She had Alzheimer's. My mother-in-law was living with us because she had Alzheimer's… and now we thought my wife was going through menopause at 49,” Irvin said.The official diagnosis came after nearly a year of testing, but the most demanding phase followed. Irvin described the physical and emotional weight of providing constant care, explaining, “It’s quite hard to take care of someone 24 hours a day.”Mood changes have made retaining in-home nurses difficult, forcing Irvin to rely on round-the-clock medical staff. “I have to keep a 24-hour nurse with her all the time,” he said, adding that agitation sometimes leads to nurses being rotated out at additional cost.Despite the challenges, Irvin has never wavered on one principle: Sandy will remain at home. “But she, if anybody, has earned the right to be in her home,” he said. “No matter what, she will be in her home.” That promise, first shared publicly in 2024, continues to define Irvin’s post-football life, one shaped less by accolades and more by endurance, loyalty, and love in the face of a relentless disease.","Michael Irvin's wife, Sandy Harrell, was diagnosed with early-onset Alzheimer’s nearly a decade ago.

“My blood is on your hands”: Paige Shiver allegedly exposed the affair herself and watched Sherrone Moore lose everything,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/my-blood-is-on-your-hands-paige-shiver-allegedly-exposed-the-affair-herself-and-watched-sherrone-moore-lose-everything/articleshow/126076860.cms,"Sherrone Moore’s firing exposed how Michigan’s workplace policy produced two vastly different outcomes. As the supervisor, Moore bore full responsibility for reporting the relationship and suffered termination, criminal charges, and financial loss. Paige Shiver, the subordinate who later reported the relationship, remained protected under whistleblower and anti-retaliation rules, fueling backlash over perceived imbalance and institutional double standards.

How university policy insulated Paige Shiver and sealed Sherrone Moore’s fate

Sherrone Moore’s collapse at Michigan has become one of the most jarring off-field scandals college football has seen in years. What began as an undisclosed workplace relationship spiraled into termination, criminal charges, and the sudden implosion of a multimillion-dollar coaching career. At the center of it all is Paige Shiver, the staffer involved in the relationship who remains employed by the university.The contrast has fueled public outrage, but the outcome wasn’t accidental. Michigan’s internal policy framework created a scenario where one party absorbed the full consequences while the other emerged protected, legally insulated, and professionally intact. The case has reignited uncomfortable questions about power, accountability, and how institutions quietly prioritize liability management over public trust.Michigan’s Policy 201.97 places the burden of disclosure entirely on the supervisor, not the subordinate. That distinction proved decisive. As head coach, Moore was required to report the relationship immediately and initiate safeguards to remove supervisory influence. He did not. Shiver, as the supervisor, had no formal reporting obligation and later came forward under whistleblower protections, triggering anti-retaliation clauses that effectively guaranteed her job security.Prosecutors allege that Moore continued contacting her. According to court filings, he allegedly threatened her saying, “I’m gonna kill myself, I’m gonna make you watch, my blood is on your hands, you ruined my life.” That moment shifted the narrative from policy violation to criminal exposure, leaving Michigan little choice but to invoke “just cause” and terminate him.Public backlash has been fierce. Critics argue Shiver benefited from promotions and salary increases during the affair, making her more than a passive participant. Social media voices insist she was “half the scandal,” yet policy language leaves little room for disciplinary symmetry.

“The decision to.…”: Gisele Bündchen’s confession raises uncomfortable questions about life with Tom Brady,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/the-decision-to-gisele-bndchens-confession-raises-uncomfortable-questions-about-life-with-tom-brady/articleshow/126076352.cms,"Gisele Bündchen’s divorce from Tom Brady, finalized in 2022, ended their 13-year marriage on calm but firm terms. Bündchen said they “grew apart,” stressing the decision was difficult but necessary. Both emphasized mutual respect, joint custody, and prioritizing their children, choosing an amicable split over prolonging an emotionally distant relationship.

Gisele Bündchen reflects on her divorce from Tom Brady and why moving forward became inevitable

More than two years after their highly publicized split, Gisele Bündchen’s divorce from NFL icon Tom Brady remains one of the most discussed celebrity breakups of the modern sports era. At the time, the separation marked the end of a 13-year marriage that blended global fashion stardom with football greatness.While speculation once dominated headlines, Bündchen’s own words offered a calmer, more reflective explanation rooted in emotional distance rather than scandal. Looking back, her statement reads less like a dramatic announcement and more like a measured acknowledgment of change. It underscored how even long, successful partnerships can reach a point where growth happens on separate paths.When the divorce was finalized in October 2022, Bündchen made it clear that the decision was not fueled by hostility, but by emotional reality. In her message, she emphasized gratitude over resentment, writing, “With much gratitude for our time together, Tom and I have amicably finalized our divorce.” She placed her children at the heart of every consideration, adding, “My priority has always been and will continue to be our children whom I love with all my heart.Her most telling reflection came when she explained the emotional distance that developed over time: “The decision to end a marriage is never easy but we have grown apart.” Rather than framing the divorce as a failure, Bündchen acknowledged it as a difficult but necessary step toward personal well-being. She also expressed goodwill toward Brady, noting that she wished him “only the best” as both moved into new chapters of their lives.Brady echoed the same tone in his own statement, reinforcing that the split was handled with mutual respect and shared responsibility. The couple agreed to joint custody and committed to working together as parents, setting an example of cooperative co-parenting despite personal change.In hindsight, the Bündchen-Brady divorce stands as a reminder that even high-profile marriages can end quietly, thoughtfully, and with dignity, without erasing the value of what once was.Also Read: Gisele Bündchen opened up about feeling “so blessed” while embracing life after divorce from Tom Brady","Gisele Bündchen and Tom Brady finalized their divorce in October 2022.

Taylor Swift and Blake Lively’s friendship appears frozen as both step out separately in New York

Taylor Swift and Blake Lively once defined celebrity best-friend energy, from coordinated red-carpet appearances to highly publicized double dates and vacations. But their latest nights out in New York City suggest that closeness may now belong firmly in the past. On the same evening, the two stars were spotted just minutes apart geographically, yet worlds away socially.Swift opted for a low-key dinner with longtime friend and musician Este Haim, while Lively focused on business, hosting a festive pop-up tied to her Blake Brown haircare brand. The contrast wasn’t just about schedules, it highlighted a visible emotional distance that fans have been quietly tracking for months.Swift was photographed heading into Chez Margaux in the Meatpacking District, keeping things intimate and understated alongside Haim. The choice of company spoke volumes. Este Haim has been part of Swift’s inner circle for years, often representing comfort, trust, and creative kinship.Meanwhile, Lively appeared polished and upbeat across town in the West Village, promoting her brand collaboration with Stoney Clover Lane and leaning into her role as entrepreneur and tastemaker.What makes the situation striking is not just that the former best friends were apart, but why. Sources and public reporting have pointed to a rupture following Lively’s ongoing legal dispute with actor Justin Baldoni, during which Swift’s name was pulled into the narrative. That moment appears to have marked a turning point.While neither star has addressed the fallout directly, the absence of shared appearances and the careful separation of social circles, has fueled speculation that the friendship hasn’t recovered.Their physical proximity that night, roughly a ten-minute walk apart, only amplified the symbolism. Once inseparable, Swift and Lively now seem to be navigating New York on parallel tracks. For fans who followed their friendship as closely as their careers, the message feels clear: whatever bond once existed, it’s currently on pause, if not permanently redefined.Also Read: “It was very personal…”: Blake Lively shares quiet message to Taylor Swift amid wedding buzz with Travis Kelce","Taylor Swift and Blake Lively were spotted out separately in New York City on the same night.

Justin Herbert net worth in Christmas 2025 reflects elite quarterback money, not celebrity excess

Justin Herbert net worth in Christmas 2025 meets holiday plans shaped by work ethic and privacy

Justin Herbert net worth in Christmas 2025 has become a hot search topic as fans track every move of the Los Angeles Chargers quarterback during the holiday season. Herbert rarely invites public attention off the field, but his rising earnings, quiet relationship with Madison Beer, and ongoing wedding speculation have pushed his personal life into the spotlight.With Christmas 2025 approaching, interest around Justin Herbert net worth in Christmas 2025, his holiday routine, and how he spends time away from football has only grown. The reality is less dramatic than the internet wants it to be. The numbers are real. The privacy is intentional. The speculation is mostly noise.Justin Herbert net worth in Christmas 2025 is estimated at around $40 million, based on reported career earnings, endorsement income, and contract data cited by outlets such as Celebrity Net Worth. That figure comes despite Herbert still being early in his second NFL contract cycle, which shows how quickly franchise quarterbacks accumulate wealth in today’s league.The foundation of Justin Herbert net worth in Christmas 2025 is his massive extension with the Los Angeles Chargers. Herbert signed a five-year, $262.5 million contract extension that runs through the 2029 season. The deal includes more than $200 million in guarantees, with a large portion locked in at signing.Contract tracking platforms such as Spotrac have shown Herbert among the league leaders in cash earnings during recent seasons, reinforcing his status as the Chargers’ long-term centerpiece.Endorsements add another layer to Justin Herbert net worth in Christmas 2025. Herbert earns millions annually from brand partnerships with companies including Nike, Fanatics, Verizon, SoFi, and others. His endorsement profile stands out because it mirrors his public image. He is positioned as disciplined, dependable, and brand safe rather than flashy. That strategy has helped stabilize his off-field income while avoiding the volatility that follows louder celebrity branding.Despite his earnings, Herbert does not publicly display a luxury-heavy lifestyle. There are no frequent exotic car reveals or headline grabbing purchases tied to his name. Financial security defines Justin Herbert net worth in Christmas 2025, not extravagance.Justin Herbert net worth in Christmas 2025 also feeds curiosity about how he spends time away from the Chargers during the holidays. Historically, Herbert has been clear about his approach to breaks. Even when describing time off, he frames it around continued training, throwing sessions, and film study.Herbert has previously said he returns home to Eugene, Oregon during downtime to see family while maintaining his football routine. He has openly stated that extended time away from football leaves him restless. Those comments remain the clearest public indicator of how Justin Herbert net worth in Christmas 2025 intersects with his holiday habits. Family time comes first. Work never fully stops.Relationship speculation has added fuel to interest in Justin Herbert net worth in Christmas 2025. Herbert has been linked to singer Madison Beer, and fans recently fixated on wedding rumors after screenshots of a Pinterest board featuring bridal gowns circulated online. The speculation intensified when Beer’s mother posted a playful comment that read, “Mother-in-law mode engaged.”None of that confirms engagement or wedding plans. Neither Justin Herbert nor Madison Beer has publicly announced any future plans together. The couple continues to keep their relationship low key, avoiding interviews and public commentary. That pattern aligns with Herbert’s long-standing approach to fame.Madison Beer has remained busy with her own career during this period. She performed at the 2025 Victoria’s Secret Fashion Show, shared behind-the-scenes moments from the event, and released reactions including “Am I dreaming?” and “What a night.” Her professional schedule further underlines why assumptions about shared holiday travel or major personal milestones tied to Justin Herbert net worth in Christmas 2025 remain unverified.There are no confirmed reports of Justin Herbert taking a luxury vacation for Christmas 2025. Based on his past statements and behavior, a quiet holiday split between family time and preparation for football remains the most accurate expectation. Anything beyond that crosses into speculation.As Christmas 2025 arrives, Justin Herbert net worth in Christmas 2025 tells a clear story. He is financially secure. He is professionally focused. He is deliberately private. The internet may want rings, destinations, and spectacle. Herbert continues to offer contracts, consistency, and silence.","Justin Herbert net worth in Christmas 2025 is estimated at around $40 million, based on reported career earnings, endorsement income, and contract data.

OKC Thunder guard Nikola Topić shows progress during treatment



Nikola Topić receives unwavering support from Thunder leadership



Nikola Topić stepped back onto the hardwood Thursday night. The Oklahoma City Thunder guard took part in an on-court workout at the Paycom Center before the team hosted the Los Angeles Clippers, marking a powerful step forward in his recovery journey. It was the first public glimpse of Topić on the floor since his testicular cancer diagnosis became known in late October.The appearance came less than two months after Thunder general manager Sam Presti revealed that Topić had been diagnosed following a biopsy at the MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston. Since then, the 20-year-old star has been undergoing chemotherapy while continuing to train with the organization, showing steady progress in controlled settings.Nikola Topić worked out alongside teammates, moved fluidly, and took shots during the session observed by team media. Thunder beat reporter Clemente Almanza shared footage of Topić dribbling, driving, and finishing through contact, noting it was his first time seeing the Serbian guard on the floor since the diagnosis.Selected 12th overall in the 2024 NBA Draft after playing for Crvena zvezda in the ABA League, Topić has already faced a difficult road. He missed the entire previous season after tearing his left ACL during the ABA League Finals in May 2024. He later debuted in NBA Summer League, averaging 10.8 points and 5.8 assists, and appeared in one preseason game on Oct.5 before further medical testing confirmed his cancer diagnosis.Despite the physical demands of chemotherapy, Topić has continued working out at the team facility. Testicular cancer is widely regarded as one of the most treatable forms of cancer in men, and the Thunder have consistently emphasized patience and support rather than timelines.Thunder general manager Sam Presti has spoken openly about the organization’s approach since the diagnosis. “Our only expectations for him are to focus on this. This is his most important priority. He’ll be back playing basketball when he’s able to, but we’re not putting any time length or expectations on that, obviously. He has our total support, encouragement and love,” Presti said.Head coach Mark Daigneault shared, “He is putting the work in where he can physically so that when he comes out of it, he is in the best possible position physically. But he has done a great job. He is right where he should be. He is doing great. The guys have been great with him. He has been great with the guys. It’s been a very humbling situation to watch because he has handled it just beautifully,” Daigneault said.There is no public recovery timeline as of yet.Also Read: NBA’s new injury reporting rule: How it could impact prop betting",Oklahoma City Thunder guard Nikola Topić took part in an on-court workout Thursday night.

NBA injury reporting rule brings tighter timelines and transparency



Prop betting faces renewed scrutiny from the NBA



The NBA has moved to tighten its grip on injury transparency. NBA Commissioner Adam Silver has been firm on the scrutiny. Sports betting continues to define how games are consumed and analyzed. Late Friday, the league reminded teams that it intends to remain involved in deciding what types of bets are allowed on its games. The message reveals that discussions with sportsbooks and regulators are far from over, especially as betting data and player availability are closely linked.The league’s reminder arrives less than two months after gambling-related arrests involving Miami guard Terry Rozier and Portland coach Chauncey Billups. Against that backdrop, the NBA framed its latest steps as a way to strengthen compliance and protect the integrity of its betting rules, while addressing injury reporting gaps that could influence wagering behavior.In a memo obtained by The Associated Press, the NBA outlined several updates that will change how teams handle injury information. These changes touch multiple areas, including injury reporting, tanking policies, and safety measures for players and coaches.Some adjustments are minor, while others mark a clear shift in daily team operations.One of the most notable updates focuses on timing. Except on the second night of back-to-back games, teams must now resubmit injury reports on game days. For games tipping at 5 p.m. or earlier, reports are due between 8 a.m. and 10 a.m. Later games require updates between 11 a.m. and 1 p.m.According to the league, the goal is to “further promote transparency regarding players’ game participation status, and thereby diminish the value of confidential information that could be ‘tipped’ ” to bettors or others.NBA insider Brett Siegel shared that intent, writing that the changes are “designed to promote greater transparency and consistency in player participation reporting.” He also shared key notes from the memo, including, “Day of game, teams must submit injury report between 11 am and 1 pm (local) that reflects each player’s current participation status.”Alongside injury updates, the league made its stance on gambling clearer. Siegel reported that the NBA is urging betting operators to rein in certain player prop offerings. “The NBA is also attempting to limit gambling companies from having certain prop bets for individual players, including the max amount that can be bet, limitations on population of players, and other limitation including eliminating certain bet types in full,” he wrote.As the regular season moves forward, these measures place fresh responsibility on teams, bettors, and sportsbooks alike. How fully those changes reshape prop betting options will depend on ongoing talks between the NBA and the gambling industry. But right now, transparency is firmly at the center of that conversation.Also Read: What’s really happening in WNBA?

Kevin Durant explains why he doesn’t care about grooming or image

In today’s NBA, image is almost part of the job. From tunnel fits to fresh fades, players like Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, LeBron James, and Stephen Curry are intentional about how they present themselves. Branding, aesthetics, and polish matter more than ever. And then there’s Kevin Durant doing the exact opposite, unapologetically.Durant recently went viral after admitting he sometimes goes a day or even two without showering, saying he likes to “go musty” to feel like he’s “in the trenches.” The quote sparked instant jokes, disbelief, and memes, but taken in full context, it fits perfectly into who KD has always been - a superstar who genuinely does not care how he’s perceived off the court.Durant made the comments while speaking with teammate Fred VanVleet on thepodcast, where the conversation turned to grooming, haircuts, and how NBA players present themselves publicly.KD made it clear he’s never been interested in maintaining a certain look just because he’s on camera. He questioned the need for frequent haircuts or lotion, joking that he might only lotion his hands if they’re dry. According to Durant, those details simply don’t register as important anymore.He also explained that he doesn’t seek out barbers. If a barber happens to be around while his friends are getting cuts, he might join in otherwise, he’s perfectly fine going weeks without touching his hair.Durant acknowledged that this wasn’t always his mindset. Early in his career, he cared more about staying groomed and presentable. Over time, that changed.He explained that once he realized how much mental energy those habits were taking, he decided they weren’t worth it. Letting go of that pressure made him feel more relaxed, more comfortable, and more himself.That shift eventually extended beyond haircuts and lotion and into daily routines.The moment that truly lit up social media came when Durant admitted he doesn’t always shower every day.He clarified immediately that this does not apply to workouts or games. KD said he showers after training and physical activity. The admission was strictly about days when he’s at home, not going anywhere, and not around people.On those days, he said, he might go a day or sometimes two without showering. That’s when he used the phrase “go musty,” explaining it makes him feel like he’s “in the trenches,” mentally locked in and stripped of distractions.Fred VanVleet was visibly surprised, jokingly calling him out, a reaction that mirrored much of the internet’s response.None of this is new behavior. Kevin Durant has built his entire public persona on being unfiltered, blunt, and unconcerned with traditional PR rules. Whether it’s his social media presence, podcast honesty, or interviews, he rarely sanitizes his thoughts.Also read - Could the Splash Brothers reunite?

Trae Young nears full return as Atlanta Hawks expect star guard to suit up despite tight turnaround

Trae Young searches for rhythm as Hawks balance shared offense with star return

On Thursday night, the Atlanta Hawks welcomed their point guard back. After missing the previous 22 games due to injury, Trae Young made a comeback to the floor as the Hawks lost to the Charlotte Hornets. The league insider claims that Young will start again against the Charlotte Hornets tonight.The Hawks have been competitive despite being without the four-time All-Star. With a 15-12 record, they are ranked eighth in the Eastern Conference. The Atlanta Hawks' biggest issue with Trae Young, according to Jalen Johnson's agent Rich Paul, is that although he is one of the league's most gifted players, they need to stop relying too much on him.Since the start of the 2025–26 NBA season, Atlanta Hawks standout Trae Young has missed a considerable amount of time. Due to a damaged MCL, Young has only been in five games for the Hawks this season and hasn't been in the starting lineup since October 31. On Thursday, though, ESPN's Shams Charania gave an encouraging report regarding the team's starting point guard.Young's availability has been questioned due to Atlanta's short turnaround to a Friday night game against the San Antonio Spurs.It is anticipated that Young will perform on Friday evening. The Hawks have made no mention of resting him on a back-to-back.Later in the day, it will be worthwhile to watch the injury report just in case. Young was labelled as probable before actually participating on Thursday night due to his knee ailment, and he fully participated in Wednesday's practice.With only eight points, he didn't have a really strong game. Against the Hornets, Young did record ten assists. When Young joined the league, he was given the all-clear. The Hawks perceived Young's potential as a combination of Steph Curry and James Harden, so they traded the 17-year-old Luka Doncic, the current EuroLeague MVP, to select him.Although he didn't achieve the MVP peak Atlanta had hoped for, this moment was still significant. He recorded crucial reps that helped him become into the offensive force he is today. Nickeil Alexander-Walker has had a chance to excel during his absence from the team.When Young joined the league, he was given the all-clear. The Hawks perceived Young's potential as a combination of Steph Curry and James Harden, so they traded the 17-year-old Luka Doncic, the current EuroLeague MVP, to select him.Trae Young has averaged 17.8 points, 2.0 rebounds, and 7.8 assists in his five games. He has recorded the lowest figures of his career and has had difficulty finding his flow on the floor. In his debut campaign, the former Oklahoma standout averaged 19.1 points per game.Paul cited the NBA's elite teams' evolving dynamics over the previous ten years as justification for the Hawks' need to alter their style of play. The Celtics and Thunder, the last two championship-winning teams, both had players ranked in the top five in the league, but their egalitarian offense fed everyone.With Young out, Jalen Johnson took the lead for Atlanta and finished the game against Charlotte with 43 points, 11 rebounds, and 9 assists. He doesn't appear to be relinquishing his position anytime soon. Young has averaged 17.8 points, 7.8 assists, and 2 rebounds per game in his five games this season. The Hawks' offence and leadership on the court are anticipated to improve with his return.Also read: Is Trae Young playing tonight Vs Toronto Raptors?

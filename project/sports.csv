Champions Trophy: Pant's trademark no-look sixes and Iyer's clean hits steal the show

NEW DELHI: Will Young and Tom Latham delivered outstanding centuries as New Zealand secured a convincing 60-run victory against hosts Pakistan in the Champions Trophy opening match on Wednesday. Young scored a crucial 107 from 113 deliveries, whilst Latham remained not out with 118 from 104 balls, guiding the Black Caps to 320 for five after Pakistan chose to field first. Glenn Phillips ' swift 61 from 39 balls proved instrumental in helping New Zealand surpass the 300-run milestone, following their initial struggles.Pakistan's top order, featuring Babar Azam (64 off 90), Mohammed Rizwan (3 off 14) and Saud Shakeel (6 off 19), displayed an overly cautious approach. This strategy proved costly as the team was dismissed for 260 in 47.2 overs.Fakhar Zaman (24 off 41) batted at the fourth position after spending considerable time off the field during New Zealand's innings due to injury concerns.This victory marked New Zealand's third consecutive win against Pakistan in under two weeks, following their two triumphs in the previous tri-series.The defending champions Pakistan found solace in their lower-order performance, with Khushdil Shah scoring an impressive 69 from 49 deliveries. Salman Agha contributed an energetic 42 from 28 balls, highlighting the missing aggression from the top order.New Zealand's bowling unit displayed precision, with William O'Rourke (3/47) and Mitchell Santer (3/66) delivering notable performances.Young anchored the innings after Pakistan's decision to bowl first had reduced New Zealand to 40 for two and subsequently 73 for three by the 17th over.Young Naseem Shah claimed the valuable wicket of Kane Williamson, who registered his first single-digit score in 35 ODI appearances.Haris Rauf, returning from injury, dismissed Daryl Mitchell, whilst spinner Abrar Ahmed removed Devon Conway early with a cleverly bowled carom ball.Young, playing as Rachin Ravindra's replacement, formed a crucial 118-run partnership with Latham for the fourth wicket.Pakistan's bowling combination, comprising one specialist spinner, three pacers, and two part-time spinners in Khushdil and Agha, struggled to break the partnership.The final overs saw Latham and Phillips launching an aggressive assault, particularly targeting Abrar and Haris in the 44th and 45th overs, followed by 18 runs off Shaheen Shah Afridi in the 47th over.President Asif Zardari inaugurated the tournament, meeting both teams alongside PCB chairman Mohsin Naqvi and ICC officials.The stadium attendance gradually increased as weather conditions improved, with spectators eager to witness their first major ICC event since 1996.","New Zealand beat Pakistan by 60 runs in Champions Trophy opener.

Mohammad Amir Exclusive: Champions Trophy hopes, India's absence & retirement talk

Such is the format of the Champions Trophy that even one defeat can jeopardise a team's chances of making it to the semifinals, and Pakistan must be licking its wounds while thinking that after their loss in the tournament opener against New Zealand on Wednesday in Karachi . But focus shifts to India's big stars in match number two, as stalwarts Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma take the field against Bangladesh in another Group-A game, this time in Dubai .The forced fourth venue for the tournament -- the Dubai International Cricket Stadium -- was brought in by the International Cricket Council (ICC) after India refused to play in Pakistan and the tournament turned hybrid.Bangladesh can be considered the weakest team on paper in Group A , but they have upset teams in the past in big tournaments. In India's case, mind rolls back to 2007, when the defeat against Bangladesh in a group game of the ODI World Cup haunted India until they exited the tournament before the knockouts.India announced their preparedness for the Champions Trophy by mauling England 3-0 in an ODI series at home, which also saw Rohit and Kohli getting some much needed runs under their belt. But losing Jasprit Bumrah to a back injury came as a jolt at the doorstep of the Champions Trophy, which has turned the fast-bowling unit a little deficient -- considering Mohammed Shami has just returned from a year-long injury layoff, Arshdeep Singh is short on ODI experience and Bumrah's replacement Harshit Rana is still finding his feet in international cricket.In contrast, the batting wears a settled look with Shubman Gill opening with Rohit, followed by Kohli, Shreyas Iyer and KL Rahul or Rishabh Pant as wicketkeeper. Axar Patel's promotion as a batter and his recent success against England adds a left-handed batter to the mix in the line-up, a role that his fellow all-rounder Ravindra Jadeja too can perform. It also allows India to play with three spinners and still have two pacers in the playing eleven.The pitch in Dubai historically has had something in it for both bowlers and batters, with spinners getting assistance as it wears down.Another team looking closely at this contest will be Pakistan, who have the big must-win match against India next on February 23. One more defeat will virtually mean curtains for the fancied hosts, which is not how they would want to welcome the return of an ICC event to the country after 29 years.Their heavy loss to the Kiwis by 60 runs in Karachi on Wednesday has let the home fans down, leaving much to be desired from both batters and bowlers who will have to come up with something special against India in three days' time in different conditions in Dubai.",India take on Bangladesh in their second Champions Trophy match. The match will be played at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium. India lost their opening game to New Zealand by 60 runs in Karachi. Pakistan face India in their next Group-A match on February 23.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118401439,imgsize-61460,width-400,resizemode-4/118401439.jpg"

Team India undergoes intense training in Dubai ahead of Champions Trophy | Exclusive Visuals

Champions Trophy: Pant's trademark no-look sixes and Iyer's clean hits steal the show

: Just when the ring of fire was lit in its full glory, the Indian cricket team was applying the final touches to their preparations for the Champions Trophy and opener against Bangladesh. The batters were knocking a few deliveries, all bowlers rolled their arm over on the available practice strip and everyone took turns for some catching to get used to the lights.Just when the players started making their way to the dressing room after finishing their routines, two intense chats began around 7 pm local time (half an hour after the scheduled end of training session). Near the playing square were coach Gautam Gambhir and Ravindra Jadeja while Rohit Sharma had Axar Patel and video analyst Hari Prasad Mohan for company in front of the dressing room. The two vital cogs of India's white-ball setup were in separate discussions which lasted well over 30 minutes.The coach kept pointing towards different parts of the ground while talking to Jadeja and captain Rohit had a more animated discussion with Axar where a lot of video footage was being used as reference.Analyst Hari kept playing visuals from different ODIs on his laptop and Rohit was even imitating Axar's release during their chat as the training session was in its final stages. Both Axar and Jadeja have a very similar skillset but are unique in their own way. The management trusts their abilities so much that both featured in the XI during the 2024 T20 World Cup, and it's set to continue during the 2025 Champions Trophy. They can bat anywhere you want, bowl anytime the situation demands and are electric in the field.More than anything, they lend control with their darts which have often suck momentum out of the opposition's innings.Plenty of eyebrows were raised when the men's senior selection committee picked five spinners in the squad for the multi-nation event but captain Rohit Sharma explained the move and asserted there are just ""two spinners"".“There are two spinners, the other three are all-rounders. I am not looking at them as five spinners. Those three guys can bat and can bowl also. The other teams have fast bowlers and all-rounders. They say that they have six fast bowlers, which is good. But we work on our strength and try to run the team on that,"" said Rohit at pre-match presser The Indian captain further added that the all-round abilities of Jadeja, Axar and Washington Sundar add a different dimension and a lot of depth to the combination.""Those three guys, Jadeja, Axar, Washi [Washington Sundar], give us a different dimension to the game, to our combination, to our squad. And they add a lot to this team and give us a lot of depth. That is why we wanted to try and get the players who can have two skills rather than one skill,"" added Rohit.India do look heavy on spin but depth was the keyword when the squad was assembled. Axar and Jadeja's skill set would make it difficult for any think-tank to look beyond them, and this Indian team is no different. They both are left-armers, effective batters, useful contributors but even after the similarities, they are different, and will continue to be the first names on the team sheet.",Team India undergoes intense training in Dubai ahead of Champions Trophy. Two intense chats began around 7 pm local time (half an hour after the scheduled end of training session) Coach Gautam Gambhir and Ravindra Jadeja had Axar Patel and video analyst Hari Prasad Mohan for company.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118394424,imgsize-46362,width-400,resizemode-4/118394424.jpg"

Champions Trophy: Will India and South Africa clash in another ICC final?

NEW DELHI: India will play all their ICC Champions Trophy 2025 matches in Dubai, but the excitement has spread worldwide. TV sets are being prepped, Team India jerseys are out and dry cleaned, refrigerators are stocked with drinks and snacks, and fans are eagerly awaiting the moment when captain Rohit Sharma walks out for the toss.The Champions Trophy fever is in full swing!Amid all the excitement, there’s been plenty of buzz surrounding the pitch. How is the pitch going to behave? If Rohit wins the toss, should he choose to bat or bowl?The answers will come on February 20, but the anticipation continues to rise!In an exclusive interview with TimesofIndia.com during the ILT20-3 season in the UAE this January, Dubai International Stadium pitch curator Matthew Sandery revealed that curators have not received any instructions from any team, including India. He also assured that the pitch would offer consistent bounce.India are in Group A alongside Bangladesh, Pakistan, and New Zealand. They will kick off their campaign in Dubai on February 20 against Bangladesh, followed by the highly anticipated clash with Pakistan on February 23, before facing New Zealand on March 2.""We're in a really good spot at the moment. We want to keep all our secrets under wraps for now. We had the Women's World Cup earlier this year, and it has really helped us improve our wickets. We're really hoping for a great tournament with our services,"" Sandery said.""No instructions (regarding the pitch). We're going to create the best surfaces for Dubai and the weather that obviously comes with the UAE. So we're going to make the best wickets possible for the best teams when they come here. We're really excited about the fact that India, Bangladesh, New Zealand, and obviously Pakistan, are coming. The big clash between India and Pakistan— as an Australian curator, I'm very excited.""We're going to produce the best quality surface at the time. We are making sure our surface is consistent, and our bounce is consistent. We want to make sure that when our players arrive here, they can hit through the ball. They should feel confident and comfortable that they can hit through the ball because fours and sixes in white-ball cricket bring people to the stands. So yeah, we're not going to change too much. We're going to make sure we create the best wickets for Dubai and Dubai only,"" Sandery said.India last faced Pakistan in Dubai in 2022, meeting twice during the Asia Cup. India registered a five-wicket win in the group stage but later fell to Pakistan by the same margin in the Super Four clash.Unlike the Asia Cup, which was a T20 tournament, the upcoming Champions Trophy will be a 50-over contest.Will dew be a decisive factor?""Of course, the UAE provides unique weather conditions, and here at the stadium, we have a unique structure. Our roof structure provides a lot of shade for most of the ground. The sunlight plays a massive role as well, because it comes across the wicket early and halfway through the afternoon. So naturally, it's going to play differently throughout the match. It's up to the batter and the bowler to adapt,"" Sandery said.","India will play all their ICC Champions Trophy 2025 matches in Dubai.

Rishabh Pant faces injury scare as Team India begins Champions Trophy training

Champions Trophy: Pant's trademark no-look sixes and Iyer's clean hits steal the show

NEW DELHI: The United States successfully defended the lowest-ever total of 122 in a non-curtailed ODI match, defeating Oman by 57 runs in their Cricket World Cup League 2 encounter.This total stands as one of the lowest successfully defended scores in men's ODIs, excluding matches with a revised target or reduced overs.In conditions heavily favoring spin bowling , Nosthush Kenjige 's metronomic left-arm spin led the American charge, claiming an impressive 5/11 from 7.3 overs to dismiss Oman for a paltry 65.Milind Kumar's off-spin (2/17) claimed the crucial wicket of Oman captain Jatinder Singh (7), while Harmeet Singh (1/25) and Yasir Mohammed (2/10) complemented Kenjige's efforts.The surface at the Oman Cricket Academy, which had shown more pace in previous years, particularly during the 2021 T20 World Cup, has favored slower bowlers in the recent ODI tri-series, which forms part of the Cricket World Cup 2027 qualification process.Notably, not a single over of pace was bowled in the match, with Oman's five-pronged spin attack matched by the USA's Milind Kumar, Harmeet Singh, Yasir Mohammad, and Kenjige.After electing to bowl first, hoping to emulate their spin success against Namibia two days prior, Oman's bowlers stifled the USA's batting lineup, with skipper Monank Patel (0) being one of five batters to fall inside the first 13 overs.Aaron Jones (16) and Sanjay Krishnamurthi (16) put up a fight, but it was Milind (47*) who carried the innings, hitting six boundaries to push the score past three figures.The Americans were bowled out for 122 in 35.3 overs, with Shakeel Ahmad's 3/20 being the best figures for Oman.However, their spin quartet's efforts overshadowed the hosts' bowling performance, as the USA successfully defended their low total, dismissing Oman for 65, their lowest score in men's international cricket.","The United States successfully defended the lowest-ever total of 122 in a non- curtailed ODI match, defeating Oman by 57 runs in their Cricket World Cup League 2 encounter.

‘CREATE A SAFETY NET’

One would expect national badminton coach Pullela Gopichand to be overjoyed with the growing number of youngsters taking up sports as a profession, as a career, as a way of life. But the former All England champion says parents must think twice before letting their children dream about becoming professional sportspersons.In a chat with TOI, the man who played a key role in making India a badminton superpower, says, “I advise parents not to put their children in sports. We are not in a position to offer sports as a career. Unless the children are from rich backgrounds or have a family business, it is not advisable for children to take up sport.”His contention is simple. Very few make it big. Those who don’t break into the elite rung of players, lack the skills to survive without sports after they retire at around 30.The Dronacharya awardee’s concern comes from initiatives like Khelo India , Top Scheme, Go Sports, OGQ and corporates making sports extremely attractive to youngsters. But there is no safety net to fall back on in case they fail to make it big.“The reality of sport is that less than 1% of people who take up sport end up having it as a profession or career,” he says. “In sports like cricket, this number could be marginally better, but in essence sport would mean that a very small percentage of them make it. Where do we end up? What are the returns of the people who have made it?”Sitting in his academy office in Hyderabad, a large glass window separating him from the playingcourts where future champions are practising, he says, “Olympic medallists who work in the Railways, RBI, Income Tax, police or a PSU have a lower rank than a civil servant who gets to reap benefits of his learning till the age of 60. The Olympic medallist who has burned himself out, will have to call the civil servant ‘sir’ or ‘madam’. They are at the mercy of the officer, hoping they will have people who will respect sportspersons who won medals for the country. And you may also find a boss with a negative mindset towards sportspersons.”He wondered if those who represented the country should be at the mercy of society wherethey may or may not get respect. “Think of what has happened to hundreds of people who have represented the country in the last 20 years in various sports, won medals. Where are they today? What is their future? What is their earning capacity?”He gives the example of sprinter Jyothi Yarraji – a 100m hurdles silver medallist from the 2022 Hangzhou Asian Games – who has been making numerous appeals for a proper job. Gopichand is also disappointed with how hockey stars like Dhanraj Pillay and Mukesh Kumar and shooter Vijay Kumar have been treated after they achieved so much for the country. “Going by what they have done for the country, is this the right kind of reward they deserve?” he asks. “If this is the case,how can we encourage our children to take up sport?”Former hockey captain Mukesh Kumar told TOI that even national-level hockey players are not getting jobs today, a statement supported by Mukesh. “In our days, we used to get some job, butnow many top PSUs and banks have stopped recruiting hockey players,” he says. “The situation is depressing.”Gopichand believes that if we really want to produce more professional sportspersons, then society must create a safety net around them. “To survive, these sportspersons also need other skills. Like spoken English presentation skills, and more importantly, a motivation to do something different once they retire. Often, just the motivation is missing,” he said.",Pullela Gopichand says parents must think twice before letting their children dream about becoming professional sportspersons.

Team India undergoes intense training in Dubai ahead of Champions Trophy | Exclusive Visuals

Solid batting lineup (at last)

India’s Champions Trophy 2025 schedule:

India vs Bangladesh on February 20 in Dubai

India vs Pakistan on February 23 in Dubai

India vs New Zealand on March 2 in Dubai

India's Champions Trophy squad:

Rohit Sharma (c), Shubman Gill, Virat Kohli, Shreyas Iyer, KL Rahul, Rishabh Pant, Hardik Pandya, Axar Patel, Washington Sundar, Kuldeep Yadav, Harshit Rana, Mohd. Shami, Arshdeep Singh, Ravindra Jadeja, Varun Chakaravarthy.

NEW DELHI: A year before the 50-over World Cup at home in 2023, India played 30 ODIs in order to find the right balance and the right combination. As a result, India had a near faultless show - up until that forgettable evening in Ahmedabad.With the ICC Champions Trophy in the offing, things are the complete opposite. Chasing a spot in the World Test Championship (WTC) final for a third cycle running, India have played the longest format for the most part. Since losing to Australia in November 2023, India have played just nine ODIs - the fewest of the eight teams that will compete in Pakistan and Dubai. Overall, only Ireland has played fewer matches than India in this period.In the last 12 months, that number has been reduced to just six matches - three in Sri Lanka and three against England at home this month. While Sri Lanka shattered India's series streak over them, India had little trouble romping past England.With few ODIs to go back on, selectors and team management had a tricky time deciding the playing XI versus England. In the first ODI, Harshit Rana played over Arshdeep Singh despite the left-arm seamer being part of the squad. Harshit, however, has made the journey to Dubai since Jasprit Bumrah's injury.The absence of Bumrah with a back injury is arguably the biggest challenge for India going into the Champions Trophy. ""My concern is they [India] are going to miss Jasprit Bumrah, there is no doubt he will be a big absence and I think they will feel it very strongly,"" wrote 2013 Champions Trophy winner Shikhar Dhawan in his column for the ICC.""For me, he is the best bowler in the world, and his accuracy is hard to replicate. He is also a very calm character and that is crucial in a huge ICC event like this,"" he added.How do you find a suitable replacement for the Player of the Tournament in the T20 World Cup and then the Player of the Series in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy? By bringing in the highest wicket-taker from the ODI World Cup, for one.After playing a lengthy will-he-won't-he game on his return from multiple injuries, Mohammed Shami played his first India game in 14 months this January. In the four matches - two T20Is and two ODIs - the returns have been modest. He's posted figures of 0/25, 3/25, 1/38 and 1/66 in the four fixtures. Maybe, more importantly, he hasn't looked to be a fitness casualty. Even though he sported the brace during the nets session in Dubai, the 34-year-old has bowled full tilt without fuss.Yet, there is no clear indication whether he will fill right back into the playing XI or will that place go to Harshit Rana. If form is an indication, the 23-year-old put his name right up the list with 3/33 in the T20I against England and then 3/53 in an ODI versus the same opponents.Dhawan has predicted Rana to have a ""breakout tournament.""""I like his attitude, he is a go-getter and he is not afraid of anything. He accepts challenges and we have seen in the England series that he is in form. I am sure he will look to seize this opportunity and, if he does, he could provide a real x-factor for India,"" stated the southpaw.After some horrible shows with the bat against New Zealand and Australia in the Test matches, India looked like a well-oiled machine against England in the shorter formats. Shubman Gill , who slammed a ton in Ahmedabad, and Shreyas Iyer have been in good form which helps the team take away the dependency on the senior batters in Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli. They, too, found runs in the ODI series. The India skipper produced 119 runs sandwiched between two single digit returns. Kohli, meanwhile, raised his bat after a half century in Ahmedabad.At the top of the order, the Rohit-Gill combination has been a fruitful pairing for India. Since 2023, Rohit and Gill have made 1874 runs as an opening pair in 27 innings, averaging 72.07, including six 100-plus and 11 fifty-plus standsPresence of Hardik Pandya , Ravindra Jadeja, Axar Patel and KL Rahul down the order gives the team the solidity it needs to produce big totals.",India have played just nine ODIs since losing to Australia in November 2023. The absence of Jasprit Bumrah with a back injury is arguably the biggest challenge for India going into the Champions Trophy. Harshit Rana has made the journey to Dubai since the left-arm seamer's injury.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118358462,imgsize-48610,width-400,resizemode-4/118358462.jpg"

Elena Rybakina ’s tennis is so smooth it gives satin a fair run. The 25-year-old rips aces almost casually and steps in and hits through the court, making it all look effortless.“It doesn’t come easy at all,” the world No. 7 said. “I’m trying to work on different things on the court. If it looks easy, I’m happy. But definitely it’s not an easy sport. I always play aggressive, today a lot of things went my way.”The Kazakh, 6 ft in her tennis shoes, was in and out of the court in 72 minutes, of which 10 minutes were lost to a drizzle. She was through 6-3, 6-2 against the Japanese Moyuka Uchijima in the second round of the Dubai Duty Free tennis championships .On a rain hit day at the WTA 1000 event , where world No. 4 Jasmine Paolini’s match against German Eva Lys was paused at match point 6-2, 6-5 (30-40) for five hours – before the players returned on court and the Italian closed on the first point – Rybakina ’s play provided the sunshine. She had seven aces and won 26 of 32 points on her first serve.It might be because the 23-year-old Japanese’ play matched well with Rybakina, who was meetingthe ball in her comfort zone and striking freely. The small crowd in attendance on an outside court recognised they were watching a special talent and got behind the Kazakh, who looked a cut above, even in tricky conditions.Next up for Rybakina, in the roundof-16 is Spain’s Paula Badosa, the other player to dodge the rain on the day. Badosa, back in the top-10, leads the headto-head 4-3, but the Moscow-born Rybakina has won their last two meetings.Rybakina, cheered on by her new coach Davide Sanguinetti, whose calls of ‘come on Elena, let’s go’ was a constant during the hour-long affair, didn’t need any encouragement.Rybakina, caught in a crossfire with the WTA, who investigated and suspended her coach Stefano Vukov and suspended the 37-year-old Croat for a year for the abusive nature of his conduct.“It’s not easy of course,” Rybakina said of her situation. “(I’m) very disappointed (with) the way it’s been handled, just the outcome. But anyway, I need to focus on my tournament. It’s what I’m trying to do. Hopefully I can just keep on playing, keep on winning.”Rybakina, who maintains she hasn’t been mistreated by Vukov, despite new information emerging in The Athletic which noted that Vukov’s behaviour prompted the Wimbledon champion’s inner circle to approach the WTA as they feared for the safety of the player.While the top players – world No.1 Aryna Sabalenka, Coco Gauff and Jessica Pegula – have refused to comment on Rybakina’s situation out of respect for the player, the Kazakh said no onehad offered support.“I don’t need support,” Rybakina said. “There are a couple of players (with whom) I’m in touch with more, but to say that I have very, very close friends on Tour is not true just because we are competing against each other. Everybody’s surrounded by their teams.”Asked what she does in her downtime, especially here in Dubai where she bought an apartment two years ago, Rybakina said she enjoys going to the beach and indulging herself in the shops.","Elena Rybakina beat Moyuka Uchijima 6-3, 6-2 in the second round of the Dubai Duty Free tennis championships. The Kazakh, 6 ft in her tennis shoes, was in and out of the court in 72 minutes, of which 10 minutes were lost to a drizzle.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118375169,imgsize-44108,width-400,resizemode-4/118375169.jpg"

BHUBANESWAR: Both the Indian men’s and women’s teams lost their respective games in the FIH Pro League at Kalinga Stadium here on Tuesday.The women’s team went down to Spain 3-4 and the men’s team lost to Germany 1-4 in a one-sided affair.Despite the loss, Rajinder Singh put up a brilliant display with his runs down the right creating several chances. But with players like Harmanpreet Singh, Hardik Singh and Sumit not playing, it was never going to be easy, and Germany took full advantage of it.Moreover, India failed to convert their five PCs, and that hurt them the most.“Good play but not good on PCs and I’m not happy with that. We haven’t scored from a PC yet and that’s not normal for us. And we’re scoring field goals and everyone's asking how can we score field goals and not PCs,” said coach Craig Fulton after the game.Earlier, the Indian women’s team began well when Baljeet Kaur scored the opener in the 19th minute. However, Sofia Rogoski and Estel Petchame scored in the 21st and 25th minutes, respectively, to put Spain in the lead.India came back strong with Sakshi Rana and Rutuja Dadaso Pisal scoring in the 38th and 45th minute, respectively. But the team’s intensity dropped in the final quarter and Spain took full advantage of it scoring two goals in a matter of three minutesSpeaking after the game, coach Harendra Singh sounded dejected and said, “We need to be more alert during free hits inside the 25m and do better game management. They at times switched off like what happened during the third goal. Lalremsiami did so well to block the shot from the PC. After that, someone should have stepped up.”Sadly, that didn’t happen and Petchame scored her second of the night in the 49th minute. Defending was even poorer during the last goal when, besides Navneet Singh, nobody went for the block and Jimenez sounded the board from the edge of the D in the 52nd minute.Meanwhile, in the men’s game, Germany began in superb fashion as Florian Sperling scored in the seventh minute itself. However, the hosts equalised six minutes later when Gurjant Singh found the target from close range. Manpreet Singh passed the ball to Rajinder, who ran down the right before offloading it to Abhishek. He in turn played it to Gurjant in front of the goal and he converted.However, Germany were back in the lead almost immediately when Thies Prinz scored a minute later. Despite India’s fightback in the third quarter, Germany scored two more in the final quarter to earn an easy win in the end.In the other match of the day, England men's team won 1-0 via penalty shootouts after their match against Spain finished 2-2 in regular time.",Both the Indian men's and women's teams lost their respective games in the FIH Pro League at Kalinga Stadium.

NEW DELHI: Captain Meg Lanning 's superb 69 off 49 balls powered Delhi Capitals to a seven-wicket win over UP Warriorz , securing their second victory in the Women's Premier League ( WPL ) in Vadodara on Wednesday.Batting first, UP Warriorz posted 166 for seven, led by Kiran Navgire’s explosive 51 off 27 balls. However, the total proved inadequate as Lanning’s innings, supported by Annabel Sutherland ’s unbeaten 41 off 35, Marizanne Kapp ’s 19 not out off 17, and Shafali Verma’s 16 off 16, guided Delhi to victory with one ball to spare.Delhi got off to a strong start, with Lanning and Shafali adding 65 runs in just 41 balls for the opening stand.

With 32 needed from three overs, Kapp eased the pressure with back-to-back boundaries off Ecclestone, before Sutherland sealed the win by striking two crucial fours off Tahila McGrath in the final over.Earlier, Navgire and Dinesh Vrinda (16 off 15) gave UP Warriorz a flying start with a 66-run stand in just 5.5 overs. However, the innings lost momentum, with five wickets falling for just 52 runs.Shweta Sehrawat (37 off 33) and Grace Harris (12) put on 36 runs for the fifth wicket before Harris chipped a simple catch to Shafali off Arundhati Reddy . Chinelle Henry’s unbeaten 33 off 15 provided a late flourish, helping UP Warriorz cross 160.Sutherland was the standout bowler for DC, finishing with 2/26 in her four-over spell.","Delhi Capitals beat UP Warriorz by seven wickets in Women's Premier League.

NEW DELHI: India skipper captain Rohit Sharma on Wednesday expressed hope that Shubman Gill will maintain his excellent form into the ICC Champions Trophy India, considered tournament favorites, will face Bangladesh in their opening match at Dubai International Stadium on Thursday, following their recent 3-0 ODI series victory against England.A highly anticipated match against Pakistan is scheduled for Sunday.Gill, who serves as vice-captain, earned the player of the series title against England, scoring 259 runs with one century and two half-centuries, recovering from his previous underwhelming Test series in Australia.""Gill is a very classy player, there was never a doubt about his ability in this squad,"" Rohit said of his deputy.""We tend to mix formats and I don't think that's the right way to judge any player. With Gill, we know the numbers are crazy, he has been superb for us in the last three-four years.""He added, ""Obviously there is a reason that he has been elevated to be the vice-captain of the team as well, hopefully he has a great tournament and it eventually will help us achieve the things that we are looking to achieve.""All eyes are on opening batsmen Rohit and star player Virat Kohli , as discussions about their future continue ahead of the 50-over tournament.Both players struggled during India's 3-1 Test defeat in Australia but showed improvement in the England ODIs, with 37-year-old Rohit scoring 119 in the second match and Kohli making 52 in the third.""The key to have success in this format, your top three-four-five batsmen need to get that big score for you to post a big score eventually,"" said Rohit.""So I think our top four batters are quite experienced and we know that once they are set, once they are in, they like to get those big runs.""The team's morale has been boosted by the return of pace bowler Mohammed Shami , especially with Jasprit Bumrah sidelined due to a back injury.Shami, 34, made his international cricket comeback in the England white-ball series after more than a year's absence due to a heel injury, taking five wickets across two T20 and two ODI matches.""All we wanted with Shami was to get back wearing the Indian colours more than anything else,"" said Rohit.""Whether he gets wickets or not, that was completely immaterial for us at that point. When you talk about a bowler like Shami who has done the job over the years so many times for us...it's just about getting back to their rhythm.""Indian spinner Kuldeep Yadav has also returned following hernia surgery, strengthening the team's spin bowling attack.""The two games that he played, the numbers will not show and with certain players you don't have to look at numbers so much,"" Rohit said of the left-arm wrist spinner.""And if these two guys are in form, the team looks very, very good,"" he added.India will play all their matches in Dubai after refusing to visit hosts Pakistan over long-standing political tensions and Rohit said the key to perform at the Dubai stadium will be to assess the pitch ""as quickly as possible"".",India captain Rohit Sharma hopes vice-captain Shubman Gill continues good form.

NEW DELHI: Despite missing star pacer Jasprit Bumrah, India remain firm favourites to win the Champions Trophy, according to former cricketers Eoin Morgan and Shane Watson Bumrah, who played a key role in India’s T20 World Cup triumph last year, will miss the eight-team tournament, which kicked off on Thursday. However, both Morgan and Watson believe that Rohit Sharma 's squad has the depth and firepower to secure the title.Speaking at an event in Mumbai, former England captain Eoin Morgan backed India as the best-positioned team in the tournament.""I can't really find any weaknesses in their squad,"" Morgan said. ""That has been the case in the last couple of tournaments as well. They reached the World Cup final in Ahmedabad, where Australia got the better of them, but then went on to win the T20 World Cup, taking the trophy from South Africa’s grasp.""Morgan emphasised the psychological advantage of winning trophies. ""Once a team has tasted success, the confidence to do it again grows, and that’s why India are the favorites.""Former Australia all-rounder Shane Watson echoed Morgan’s sentiment, highlighting Hardik Pandya ’s return as a crucial boost for India.""With Hardik Pandya back as a fast-bowling all-rounder, India have become even stronger,"" Watson noted. ""Unfortunately, they don’t have Bumrah, but their squad is nearly identical to the one that dominated the last ODI World Cup up until the final.""Watson also expressed confidence in Australia’s ability to perform on the big stage, despite the absence of key pacers Pat Cummins, Mitchell Starc, and Josh Hazlewood.""The Aussies know how to step up in major tournaments,"" Watson said. ""Their batting lineup is formidable, but there are some concerns about their bowling.""Morgan pointed out that the England-Australia clash in the group stage could set the tone for either team.""England haven’t been in great form lately. Brendon McCullum has just taken over, so it’s difficult to expect immediate results,"" Morgan explained. ""But if they beat Australia — who are missing their top pacers — they could gain momentum and go on a roll.""He also acknowledged Pakistan as a strong contender, particularly given the conditions.""Pakistan can never be ruled out, especially in conditions that suit them,"" he added.With the Champions Trophy underway, all eyes are on India as they aim to live up to their billing as favorites, despite missing their pace spearhead.","Former cricketers Eoin Morgan and Shane Watson have backed India to win the Champions Trophy.

'Gill a very, very classy player'

‘Can’t keep thinking about unpredictable dew factor’

Rohit's praise for Pakistan pacers

DUBAI: He arrived 40 minutes late and kept coughing continuously. However, once he spoke, Indian captain Rohit Sharma didn't take time to hit back at suggestions that picking as many as five spinners for their Champions Trophy squad for their campaign on what is likely to be a flat wicket at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium could be a luxury.In an interview to TOI on Feb 16, former India opener and current UAE head coach Lalchand Rajput had said that he was a “bit surprised” that India had picked a plethora of spinners for the 2025 Champions Trophy for their matches in Dubai, where the pitches, he felt, could be ""flat and even a bit helpful for the quicks since it's still winter in UAE.""Talking to the media on the eve of his team's tournament opener against Bangladesh on Thursday, Rohit asserted that three of the five spinners in India's arsenal were all-rounders, and his team was playing on its strength, which was spin.“There are two spinners, the other three are all-rounders. I am not looking at them as a five spinners. Those three guys can bat and can bowl also. The other teams have fast bowlers and all-rounders. They say that they have six fast bowlers, which is good. But we work on our strength and try to run the team on that. Those three guys, Jadeja, Axar, Washi, give us a different dimension to the game, to our combination, to our squad. And they add a lot to this team and give us a lot of depth. That is why we wanted to try and get the players who can have two skills rather than one skill,"" Rohit spelled out on Wednesday.Mystery spinner Varun Chakaravarthy and Chinaman bowler Kuldeep Yadav are the two specialist spinners, while Ravindra Jadeja, Axar Patel and Washington Sundar are very genuine allrounders.Naturally, Rohit was pleased as punch with the sublime form of his deputy, Shubman Gill, considering how he struggled a bit in Australia in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy. Having cracked scores of 87, 60 & 112 against England in the recently-held ODI series at home, Gill on Wednesday climbed his way to becoming the NO 1 ODI batter in world cricket, replacing Pakistan's Babar Azam.Showering praise on the 25-year-old opener, Rohit said, ""Look, Gill is a very, very classy player. There was never a doubt about his ability in this squad. The formats, I think we tend to mix formats. And I don't think that's the right way to judge any player. Certain players have their strength in certain formats. And if the one format doesn't go well, doesn't mean that the other format will be the same.Citing Gill's splendid ODI record-he has scored 2587 runs in 50 matches@60.16, with seven hundreds and 15 fifties, Rohit said, “And it's there for all of us to see what happened in Australia. Things have changed, certainly in a different format. So, with Gill, we know the numbers are crazy. If you look at it, he's been superb for us in the last three, four years that he's batted. And obviously, there is a reason that he's been elevated to be the vice-captain of the team as well. Hopefully, he has a great tournament, and it will eventually help us achieve the things that we are looking to achieve.""On the importance of the Champions Trophy, which is taking place after eight years, Rohit said: ""Look, it's happening after 2017. But every title, or ICC trophy that you play is so important. And not just this Champions Trophy, but the previous World Cups that we played were all important for us. And it's no different here. You come here thinking that you want to lift the trophy, but there are so many things that you have to do right before holding on to that trophy. I think as a team our focus will be on that, how we can do things right on the field and how we can move forward. So, that will be our goal, thinking, how we can think about just one game at a time and keep moving forward from there. So, yes, it's a very important tournament.""The Indian captain didn't seem too fussed about the usually-dreaded 'dew factor' which can hurt teams in white-ball cricket while defending at night, as he felt that it in any case tough to predict whether dew would fall during the match or not.""See, I'm not too sure about the dew. Dew is a very unknown factor to all of us. And it is very, very unpredictable because, like for us in India, we are so aware of certain conditions and certain venues. That also surprised us a little bit when we played in Nagpur the previous day before the game. There was so much dew, but during the game there was no dew. So, you can't really think too much about that and prepare based on that,"" Rohit said.Meanwhile, Rohit praised two young net bowlers who hail from Pakistan- left-arm pacers Wasim Akram (named after Pakistan swing bowling great Wasim Akram by his father) and Owais Ahmed, whom he and the rest of the Indian batters faced in the last few days. ""Both of them were really good bowlers. I got a lot of feedback from our batters that they were really good. That's about it. And we had a little bit of time to chat with them as well. They live here. Other than that, I don't know much about them. This was the first time we saw them. And they were both really quality bowlers,"" Rohit complimented.","Rohit Sharma hits back at suggestions that picking five spinners for Champions Trophy could be a luxury. The Indian captain says his team was playing on its strength, which was spin. Rohit was pleased as punch with the sublime form of his deputy, Shubman Gill.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118391648,imgsize-46912,width-400,resizemode-4/118391648.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Yash Rathod and Akshay Wadkar stitched together an unbeaten 91-run partnership as Vidarbha recovered from a mini-collapse to take a 260-run lead against Mumbai at stumps on Day 3 of their Ranji Trophy semifinal in Nagpur on Wednesday.After dismissing Mumbai for 270 and securing a crucial 113-run first-innings lead, Vidarbha found themselves in early trouble at 56/4, thanks to Shams Mulani ’s (2/50) incisive spell. However, Rathod (59*) and Wadkar (31*) stabilized the innings, guiding the hosts to 147/4 in 53 overs by the close of play.With two full days remaining and Mumbai’s spinners making the ball talk, Vidarbha know the job is far from done despite their commanding lead.With a solid 113-run cushion, Vidarbha hoped for a strong start, but Mumbai all-rounder Shardul Thakur (1/14), set to join Essex for the County Championship, struck early in the second over. Thakur trapped Atharva Taide for a duck with an inswinger, offering Mumbai a glimmer of hope.Danish Malewar (29), who scored a crucial 79 in the first innings, looked fluent with five boundaries before Mulani dismissed him with a sharp return catch, reducing Vidarbha to 40/2.Karun Nair (6), in brilliant form this season, joined Dhruv Shorey (13) but couldn’t steady the innings. Off-spinner Tanush Kotian (1/33) trapped Shorey LBW with a classic off-break, further denting Vidarbha’s hopes.Nair, expected to anchor the innings, fell to Mulani while attempting a defensive stroke. He reviewed the LBW decision, but the appeal was unsuccessful, leaving Vidarbha struggling at 56/4.With Mumbai in control, Rathod and Wadkar dug in to rebuild the innings, playing cautiously against the spinners while finding occasional boundaries to keep the scoreboard moving. Their unbroken 91-run stand ensured Vidarbha regained stability before the end of play.Earlier, Akash Anand ’s gritty century helped Mumbai recover from an overnight 188/7. Anand, resuming on 67, played a patient knock, scoring 100 off 256 balls with 11 fours. He shared a crucial 69-run stand with Tanush Kotian (33), steering Mumbai close to the 250-mark.Left-arm spinner Parth Rekhade broke the partnership, bowling Kotian with a well-flighted delivery.

Mohammad Amir Exclusive: Champions Trophy hopes, India's absence & retirement talk

Brief Scores:

Kerala 457; 187 overs (Mohammed Azharuddeen 177 not out, Sachin Baby 69, Salman Nizar 52; Arzan Nagwaswalla 3/81, Chintan Gaja 2/75).

Gujarat 222/1; 71 overs (Priyank Panchal 117 batting, Aarya Desai 73, Manan Hingrajia 30 batting; Nedumankuzhy Basil 1/40). Gujarat trail by 235 runs.

NEW DELHI: Gujarat ’s experienced batter Priyank Panchal played a composed knock, remaining unbeaten on 117, as the former champions reached 222/1 at stumps on Day 3 of their Ranji Trophy semifinal against Kerala in Ahmedabad on Wednesday.Trailing by just 235 runs with two full days left, Gujarat’s batting lineup displayed resilience and intent on a placid Motera pitch, where Kerala seemed to have fallen at least 100 runs short after scoring at a slow pace.Resuming their first innings at 418/7, Kerala added 39 more runs before being bowled out for 457 within 10 overs of the morning session. Mohammed Azharuddeen remained unbeaten on a career-best 177 off 341 balls, an innings laced with 20 fours and a solitary six, holding Kerala’s innings together as wickets tumbled around him.Gujarat skipper Chintan Gaja provided the breakthrough early in the day, dismissing Aditya Sarwate with a delivery that straightened from middle stump to clip the off-stump. Sarwate managed just one run before becoming Gaja’s 200th first-class victim in his 59th match.Sensing the need for quick runs, Azharuddeen pushed Kerala past 450 with a boundary off Arzan Nagwaswalla. However, with wickets falling at the other end, he was left stranded as Nidheesh MD (run out) and Nedumankuzhy Basil (bowled by Gaja) departed in quick succession.In response, Gujarat’s openers started positively, with Panchal and Aarya Desai forging a solid 131-run partnership in 36.4 overs.Desai, mixing aggression with composure, scored 73 off 118 balls, hitting 11 boundaries and a six. However, he lost his wicket after dragging a wide delivery from Basil onto his stumps.Despite the breakthrough, Kerala’s bowlers struggled to make further inroads. Panchal, a veteran of the domestic circuit, anchored the innings with a perfect balance of caution and aggression.He reached his 29th first-class century—and his second of the season—off just 155 balls, bringing up the milestone in style with a six over long-on against Sarwate.The 34-year-old, once on the fringes of the Indian team after Gujarat’s historic Ranji Trophy triumph in 2016-17, had endured a quiet season with just one century (against Rajasthan) and a half-century (against Vidarbha) before this match. However, he delivered when his team needed him most.Hingrajia provided steady support at the other end, remaining unbeaten on 30 off 108 balls with three boundaries.For Kerala, veteran spinner Jalaj Saxena created some chances and induced a few edges, but the lack of support from the field meant Gujarat continued to consolidate their position.",Gujarat reach 222/1 at stumps on Day 3 of their Ranji Trophy semifinal. Priyank Panchal unbeaten on 117 as Gujarat trail by 235 runs.

Team India undergoes intense training in Dubai ahead of Champions Trophy | Exclusive Visuals

NEW DELHI: Indian cricket superstar Virat Kohli has always enjoyed the Champions Trophy format, which demands teams to be at their best from the very first match.The tournament is being held for the first time since 2017, when India lost the final to Pakistan . India will begin their campaign against Bangladesh in Dubai on Thursday.""The tournament is returning after a long time. I have always liked this competition because it represents consistency — you have to be among the top eight ranked teams to qualify. The level of competition is always high,"" Kohli told Star Sports.Having featured in three editions of the Champions Trophy — 2009, 2013 (when India won), and 2017 — Kohli compared the event’s pressure to that of the fast-paced T20 World Cup.Also See: India vs Pakistan Head to Head Records in CT ""In ODIs, this tournament creates the same pressure as a T20 World Cup. You only get three or four league games, and if you don’t start well, you’re immediately under pressure. That’s why I like it—you have to be at your best from game one,"" the former India captain explained.India will face Pakistan on February 23 and New Zealand on March 2 in their remaining group-stage matches. While Pakistan is the official host, India will play all their games in Dubai under the event’s hybrid model.Kohli, looking to score big in the tournament, aims to continue his form after a tough Test series in Australia. He regained his touch in the preceding ODI series against England, where he scored a half-century in the final match in Ahmedabad.","Virat Kohli has always enjoyed the Champions Trophy format.

Nahid Rana: The Bangladesh Express,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/icc-champions-trophy-2025/nahid-rana-the-bangladesh-express/articleshow/118389843.cms,"Nahid Rana (Photo credit: ICC)

DUBAI: Usually, Bangladesh's biggest calling card, their most bankable factor is spin, whether it's red ball or white-ball cricket. It was, therefore, a pleasant surprise when Bangladesh captain Najmul Hossain Shanto spoke about pace being a big strength of his side's rather tough 2025 Champions Trophy Group A opener against a formidable India.Much of Shanto's confidence comes from the presence of a young tearaway fast bowler called Nahid Rana in the Bangladesh team. Unlike most Bangladesh pacers, who have relied on cutting and moving the ball, Rana, just 22, can rattle the batters by generating express speeds of 150kph and maintaining a radar of 145kph consistently.Obviously, Rana is not the type of cricketer that Bangladesh are used to having. At the pre-match presser on Wednesday, when Shanto was asked that as a captain, how much fun it is to have someone like that in your team, the Bangladesh skipper responded by saying: “Yes, very happy. In the last few matches, he bowled really well and fast. And when we see bowling like this, it helps our whole bowling unit. It's motivated us on how we can give our opponent a challenge. So that is one thing I really like. But what I want, he needs to be fit and he can continue his bowling form. We have got another two - three fast bowlers as well. We have a good bowling unit.”Indeed, it’s an unusual discussion-people talking about Bangladesh's fast bowling department. Shanto credited the Bangladesh Cricket Board’s decision to play domestic cricket with the Dukes ball, and the right coaching, as the big reason behind this turnaround.“I think the important thing is the wicket and the ball has been changed in first class cricket. We play with the Duke ball, so the fast bowlers want to bowl a lot of overs and we get a little bit charged. And obviously there are a lot of local coaches and obviously overseas coaches there, so they helped and they motivated the fast bowler how they can compete in this international arena, so that is one thing the ball has changed and the wicket and thanks to BCB the way they think about our fast bowlers. So, that is the one thing our first bowlers come up,” Shanto said.The young turk has done well in his nascent career, having taken 20 wickets in six Tests and four scalps in three ODIs for Bangladesh. So far, Rana has bowled in just one match to India-the opening Test in Chennai in September last year, and went for 1-82 & 1-21 as India scored a thumping 280-run win over Bangladesh in that match. However, this sample size isn't enough to judge what he could do against India on Thursday and further down in his promising career. Remember what a certain Pakistan ‘pace missile’ Shoaib Akhtar did to India in a Test match at the Eden Gardens in Kolkata in 1999.If Rana produces even 70% of that magic and rocks India’s star-studded top-order of skipper Rohit Sharma, Shubman Gill, Virat Kohli and Shreyas Iyer, he would become a global cricket star in the making.Quizzed further on the buzz on Rana, Shanto said, “Recently, he played one Test match against them, so he had that little bit of experience, but he has to deliver tomorrow. He is not someone who thinks about his opponents a lot. He just thinks about how he is executing his plan. So, I hope he will execute his plan and try to do well for the team,” Shanto said.Indeed, for someone who did not pick up a cricket ball until his late teens, having grown up playing taped tennis ball cricket in Rajshahi, Rana has travalled in quick time to become Bangladesh's quickest-ever pacer. Having established himself in the Tigers squad, Rana is now ready for his first taste of an ICC global event – a prospect he is relishing.""The opportunity to play against the best cricketers in the world is the highest form of inspiration. I am enjoying every moment of international cricket. Things have happened very fast but I’m grateful for everything. It is never easy to adapt to international cricket but I was lucky in the sense that I got to play a good number of first-class matches before my debut. I feel that is the best thing that could have happened as you get exposed to all sorts of different situations and conditions. But international cricket is a totally different level altogether,"" Rana told the ICC website.“I learned every day on and off the field, from fitness to how to how to take care of the body, the diet, understanding and executing plans, learning from the coaches and the more experienced players The team expected me to bowl fast and used me as an attacking option. I tried to repay the faith by sticking to my strengths and staying humble,” he added.Nahid made his Test debut against Sri Lanka in March 2024 in Sylhet and immediately impressed, taking three for 87 in the visitors’ first innings, and finishing with five wickets overall.He built on those performances in Pakistan later in the year, dismissing Babar Azam, Shan Masood and Saud Shakeel in the space of three consecutive overs in Rawalpindi to help his side to a 2-0 series win, taking six wickets in two Tests. Nahid will return to Pakistan for Bangladesh’s Group A clashes against the hosts and New Zealand, hoping to pick up where he left off, though things will be completely different in the ODI format, in an event where the pitches are mostly batsmen-friendly.“We played on pitches that were very good for batting and the margins for the fast bowlers were less. Despite that, we made the right adjustments and bowled exceptionally as a fast bowling group. The pitches could be even better for the Champions Trophy and we have to be focused on proper execution of our plans,” he said.",Nahid Rana has taken 20 wickets in six Tests and four in three ODIs for Bangladesh. The 22-year-old has a top speed of 150kph and a radar of 145kph. Bangladesh captain Najmul Hossain Shanto says he is happy to have Rana in the team.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118389848,imgsize-32560,width-400,resizemode-4/118389848.jpg"

Liverpool 's unbeaten streak in the Premier League extended to 22 matches, but their second consecutive 2-2 draw, this time against Aston Villa , gives Arsenal renewed optimism in the title chase.Liverpool extended their advantage to eight points over Arsenal at the top of the leaderboard, but Arsenal now have played a match less.A point does little for Villa's hope of returning to the Champions League next season as they remain in ninth. A challenging fixture awaits Slot's squad as they prepare to face Manchester City away from home on Sunday.Initially ahead through Mohamed Salah's strike, Liverpool found themselves trailing after Youri Tielemans and Ollie Watkins turned the tide in Villa's favour.A deflected effort from Trent Alexander-Arnold brought Liverpool level, yet they should have secured all three points when Darwin Nunez squandered an excellent opportunity after coming off the bench.The hosts nearly snatched victory in the closing moments, with both Morgan Rogers and Donyell Malen coming close to finding the winner.An early opportunity for Villa saw Marcus Rashford's cross deflected into the net by Virgil van Dijk, but the effort was nullified due to Rashford being in an offside position.The breakthrough came at 29 minutes, though Villa were ultimately responsible for their own undoing. Diogo Jota intercepted Andres Garcia's poor backpass and generously set up Salah, who netted his 29th goal of the campaign.Within nine minutes, Villa equalised when Liverpool's inadequate clearance from a free-kick landed perfectly for Tielemans, who executed a skilful volley into the net.Jota squandered a golden opportunity to put the visitors ahead, sending his shot well off target despite being one-on-one with Emi Martinez.Villa capitalised on Liverpool's defensive lapse before the interval, as Watkins found himself unmarked to head Lucas Digne's cross into the distant corner.Liverpool dominated the second half proceedings, helping Slot maintain his unbeaten away record in the Premier League.Alexander-Arnold's increasing prominence in the match led to his equalising goal at 60 minutes, with a shot that deflected off Tyrone Mings.In pursuit of victory, Slot introduced Luis Diaz and Nunez as substitutes, with one of them having a clear opportunity to secure three crucial points.Presented with an unguarded net after Dominik Szoboszlai's pass, Nunez missed the target, leaving his manager visibly frustrated.",Liverpool held to a 2-2 draw by Aston Villa at Villa Park.

Bayern Munich clinched their spot in the Champions League's last 16 with a last-gasp goal against Celtic on Tuesday. The German giants will be joined by Club Brugge and Benfica , who also progressed to the next round. But it wasn't to be for AC Milan , who made a painful exit after a draw with Feyenoord .Bayern, who held a 2-1 advantage from the away leg, struggled to extend their lead at home. Harry Kane came close but struck the crossbar in the first half, while it was the visitors from Scotland who took a surprising lead after 63 minutes when Nicolas Kuehn, who previously played for Bayern, capitalised on Kim Min-jae's defensive error to slot the ball into the bottom corner.That meant the tie was heading for extra time, but Bayern ultimately would not need to go that far as they scored in the fourth minute of injury time.Davies scored from close range to level the match at 1-1, securing Bayern's progression with a 3-2 aggregate victory in the prestigious European competition.The draw scheduled for Friday will reveal whether Kompany's side faces Bayer Leverkusen or Atletico Madrid in the round of 16.Earlier, seven-time European Cup winners Milan were eliminated by Feyenoord, following their 1-1 draw at San Siro. It took the Dutch club through 2-1 on aggregate.Santiago Gimenez, facing his former team after his recent departure, scored from close proximity in the opening minute, bringing Milan level on aggregate.The match took a turn when Milan's Hernandez received his second yellow card early in the second period, resulting in his dismissal. Carranza equalised for Feyenoord with 73 minutes on the clock.In the closing moments, Feyenoord's Read was dismissed with a red card, though his team had already secured their progression in the tie.They now await to face either Inter Milan or Arsenal in the last-16 stage.In Lisbon, Benfica secured their progression despite a 3-3 home draw with Monaco, winning 4-3 on aggregate, setting up a clash with either Barcelona or Liverpool.The Portuguese side, who had secured a 1-0 away victory in the previous week, strengthened their position when Kerem Akturkoglu found the net halfway through the opening period.Monaco mounted a strong response as Takumi Minamino and Eliesse Ben Seghir scored before and after the interval, bringing the aggregate score level.Vangelis Pavlidis converted from the spot, marking his seventh goal in six Champions League appearances, levelling the match at 2-2, before Monaco's substitute George Ilenikhena responded with another goal.However, the tie swung decisively back towards Benfica as Orkun Kokcu made it 3-3 on the night in the 84th minute.Young sensation Chemsdine Talbi netted twice to help Club Brugge secure a 3-1 away win against Atalanta in Italy, sealing a comprehensive 5-2 aggregate victory.Following Talbi's double, Ferran Jutgla added a brilliant goal as the Belgian side built upon their 2-1 home advantage from the previous week's first leg. They will now face either Lille or Aston Villa in the round of 16.Despite Atalanta's 29 shots at goal, they fell victim to counter-attacks from the visitors, with Ademola Lookman's goal early in the second half providing little comfort.Lookman missed from the penalty spot and Atalanta skipper Rafael Toloi received a red card in the closing stages, leading to Atalant's elimination.","Bayern Munich secure their place in the Champions League's last 16 with a last- gasp goal against Celtic on Tuesday.

Arne Slot confident Liverpool can handle Premier League title race pressure,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/epl/top-stories/arne-slot-confident-liverpool-can-handle-premier-league-title-race-pressure/articleshow/118356270.cms,"Arne Slot. (Liverpool FC Photo)

Liverpool boss Arne Slot insists his side can cope with the mounting pressure of the Premier League title race despite showing signs of nerves in their tense 2-1 win over Wolves.The Reds travel to Aston Villa on Wednesday, knowing a victory will extend their lead to 10 points over second-placed Arsenal as they push for a record-equalling 20th English title.However, Liverpool have looked less assured in recent weeks. They nearly squandered a two-goal lead against Wolves and had already suffered a late collapse in the Merseyside derby when Everton’s James Tarkowski scored a stoppage-time equaliser. Their recent FA Cup exit at the hands of second-tier Plymouth has only added to concerns that the treble chasers may be feeling the pressure.Left-back Andrew Robertson admitted nerves were natural as the finish line approaches, but Slot pointed to Liverpool’s ability to grind out tight wins as proof they won’t buckle.“This is happening because we are nearing the end of the season, not because of us, but because of what people make of it,” Slot said on Tuesday. “We have won plenty of games by just one goal, home and away. I remember Crystal Palace away when it was tight in the end. If this happens now, people talk about nerves. But securing a win in the Premier League, especially at 1-0, always involves hard work and defending.”Adding to Liverpool’s challenge is Arsenal’s remarkable 15-match unbeaten run in the league since their last defeat at Newcastle on November 2.Several Liverpool players have prior title race experience from their 2020 Premier League triumph under Slot’s predecessor, Jurgen Klopp. Slot himself successfully managed pressure when leading Feyenoord to the Dutch title. However, he remains cautious about overvaluing past experiences.“We lean on the players. They have to show up and perform,” he said. “We don’t hold meetings on how to handle pressure—it doesn’t work that way. Experience helps, but we shouldn’t overvalue it. The ones who won the league here last time did it in the COVID era with no fans, and at one point, they were 25 points ahead. That’s hardly pressure.”Slot acknowledges that Aston Villa, who boast a formidable home record, pose a serious challenge for Liverpool.“When you see the fixture list, Villa away is one of the toughest you can face. They have a very good manager with a strong game plan,” Slot said.Despite not being at their best against Wolves, Slot believes that grinding out a win after the disappointment against Everton was crucial.“These are the games you must win if you want to achieve something. We didn’t play our best, but we fought until the end. That tells you a lot about this team.”Liverpool will be without Cody Gakpo and Joe Gomez for the Villa clash, with the latter set to be sidelined for ""a number of weeks"" due to a hamstring injury.",Liverpool boss Arne Slot insists his side can cope with the pressure of the Premier League title race.

A solitary goal from James Maddison in the 13th minute propelled Spurs above United to 12th position, marking their third triumph over United this season.The win provided relief for Tottenham's manager Ange Postecoglou, who had faced criticism following recent eliminations from domestic cup competitions and poor league performance. United slipped to 15th position, though maintaining a comfortable 12-point gap from the relegation zone.""The place in the table is my worry, I am not worried about me,"" said Amorim, who has managed just four victories in 14 Premier League matches since his November appointment. ""I hate to lose. That feeling is the worst. The rest I am not thinking about. I understand my situation, my job, I am confident in my work and I just want to win games.""Tottenham's first home league victory since November occurred amidst supporter unrest. Fans expressed their dissatisfaction towards ENIC and chairman Daniel Levy through protests before and after the match.

Goalkeeper Guglielmo Vicario made his first appearance since November, whilst Maddison returned to the starting eleven. Destiny Udogie, Brennan Johnson and Wilson Odobert were available as substitutes.""They are quality players. We've had it pretty tough the last two-and-a-half months,"" said Postecoglou. ""It was important for us to win and gain some traction. I certainly feel there is still a massive opportunity for us in this back half of the season and hopefully today is the start of that.""United faced their own injury challenges, with Amad Diallo joining Lisandro Martinez as long-term absentees and Kobbie Mainoo sidelined for a month.

Vicario denied attempts from Hojlund and Alejandro Garnacho, whilst Maddison capitalised on Andre Onana's parry to score. Garnacho missed a clear opportunity before halftime, and Zirkzee failed to convert a promising header later in the match.United's offensive struggles continued, with only the bottom three clubs and Everton scoring fewer than their 28 goals in 25 league matches.

NEW DELHI: Liverpool on Sunday secured a 2-1 victory against Wolves at Anfield, extending their lead at the top of the Premier League to seven points.Luis Diaz ended his goal drought with his first goal in 2025, while Mohamed Salah continued his impressive form as Liverpool bounced back from a disappointing week.The Colombian forward scored his 13th goal of the season after going 10 games without finding the net.Salah's penalty conversion before halftime marked his 28th goal across all competitions this season.Wolves' Matheus Cunha scored in the second half, but Liverpool managed to hold on despite showing signs of fatigue in a tense finish.Liverpool's previous two matches resulted in an FA Cup fourth round defeat to Plymouth and a 2-2 draw with Everton.Arsenal's recent 2-0 victory at Leicester had put additional pressure on Liverpool's title pursuit.Liverpool's response moved them closer to potentially securing their 20th English title, which would equal the existing record.With upcoming matches against Aston Villa, Manchester City, and Newcastle in the next 10 days, Liverpool could strengthen their position in the title race.Manager Arne Slot was present despite facing charges for confronting referee Michael Oliver after the Merseyside derby.The incident stemmed from Slot's disagreement over James Tarkowski's stoppage-time equalizer, which he believed should have been disallowed due to a possible foul by Beto on Ibrahima Konate.Slot had urged Liverpool to use their 'anger' from the painful end to the Everton game as fuel to get back on track against Wolves.Diaz opened the scoring in the 15th minute with his first league goal at Anfield since September.The goal came after Diaz found Salah, whose return pass deflected off Toti Gomes. Diaz managed to chest the ball past Wolves goalkeeper Jose Sa.Dominik Szoboszlai nearly added to Liverpool's lead with a low shot that went wide.Jose Sa was forced to save Diogo Jota's attempt following Andy Robertson's cross.Liverpool extended their lead in the 37th minute through Salah's penalty, despite Wolves' protests about a possible push by Diaz on Emmanuel Agbadou.Salah's recent form has been exceptional, with seven goals in his last six appearances.Wolves' new signing Marshall Munetsi missed a clear opportunity early in the second half, with Alisson Becker making a crucial save.A penalty decision for Liverpool was overturned by VAR after replays showed Jota had dived following Agbadou's challenge.Cunha took advantage of Liverpool's declining momentum, scoring with a curling shot past Ryan Gravenberch in the 67th minute.Liverpool persevered through a challenging final period to claim their fourth victory in five league matches.","Liverpool beat Wolves 2-1 to extend their lead at the top of the Premier League to seven points.

reflect on the suspension of Stefano Vukov, the coach of

DUBAI: The Women's Tennis Association's efforts to create a safe environment for players isn't lost on the leading ladies in the Dubai Duty Free tennis championships, but that awareness is delivered with a coordinating conjunction. While they applauded the WTA 's stand in general they refused to comment on the suspension of Stefano Vukov, coach of Elena Rybakina.Coco Gauff ,the third seed at the WTA 1000 event here, steered clear of Vukov's oneyear ban because she knew the 25-year-old was unhappy with the Tour's decision to ban her coach. ""It's nice that the WTA is out there to protect players, I definitely feel protected by them,"" the 20-year-old American said, adding the Tour put up contact information on bathroom stalls in lockerrooms around the world, providing an avenue for players to report abuse anonymously.The 37-year-old Vukov — a former player from Croatia — started working with Rybakina in Febuary 2019. Rybakina, the world No. 7, who opens her campaign here against qualifier Moyuka Uchijima, denied Vukov had ever mistreated her.The Moscow-born Kazakh's game improved rapidly when she teamed with the Croat, her ranking climbing from 191 to the top-40 in less than a year. Rybakina, who won Wimbledon in 2022, quickly became the talking point in tennis circles, not just for her obvious talent and smooth style of play, but also because of Vukov, whose behavior was obviously out of order. A report in The Athletic noted that Vukov had called Rybakina ‘stupid', telling her that without him she would ‘still be in Russia picking potatoes.'Rybakina, who has struggled with her health, especially in the past year, split with Vukov last August, but rehired him in January adding a twist to an already complicated situation. In between she started working with former Wimbledon champion Goran Ivanisevic, who quit her team after the Australian Open. The Kazakh, who says she's still getting coached by Vukov on the phone, is also working with Italian Davide Sanguinetti.""I'm disappointed with the situation, and how the process went,"" Rybakina said of the decision to ban Vukov.Abusive coaches and parents are not new to tennis and the WTA has been quick on the button, famously with Jim Pierce and Damir Dokic, both of who fell in the dads from hell column and faced bans from the Tour.Gauff said, ""That's important in our sport because a lot of times victims don't even know they are victims. It has happened so many times in this sport. You see former players speaking out (on abuse) years after their careers ended.""She added, ""It's a unique sport, you're 14, 15 and out of the country, most of the time you aren't traveling with your parents, so anything can happen.""And sometimes it is the parents who are the problem. Jessica Pegula, the world No. 5, said she didn't know the details of Rybakina's case. ""I don't really think I should know,"" she said with a shrug, ""People nowadays have this feeling that they have a right to someone's personal life, with social media they (feel) they have the right to know things. The point of safeguarding is to be able to report private information and know your name's not going to be out there. Maybe for the victim, you don't want anything coming out that would make them uncomfortable,"" Pegula said.","Elena Rybakina's coach Stefano Vukov banned for one year by the WTA.

The World Anti-Doping Agency on Monday offered an explanation for why top-ranked tennis player Jannik Sinner received a much shorter doping ban than the six-year suspension it handed to a Spanish figure skater in a similar doping case.Spanish media has been calling attention to the lengthy ban handed to local skater Laura Barquero after she tested positive for the anabolic Clostebol, the same substance that earned Sinner a three-month ban after a settlement reached between WADA and the Italian tennis player on Saturday. The deal was criticised by many of his fellow tennis professionals this weekend.WADA pointed out that while both cases involved the same substance, the specific facts related to Barquero's case were ""very different"" to Sinner's.""The fundamental difference between the two cases is that Ms. Barquero's version of how the substance entered her system was unconvincing in light of the evidence, such that the circumstances remained unknown as far as WADA was concerned,"" WADA said in an email sent to The Associated Press. ""In contrast, in the Sinner case, the evidence clearly confirmed the athlete's explanation as outlined in the first instance decision.""Barquero first tested positive for Clostebol during the 2022 Winter Olympics, then again in January 2023 in an out-of-competition test carried out by the International Skating Union. WADA eventually entered into a ""case resolution agreement"" in which the athlete was suspended for six years. It said the agreement was accepted and signed by WADA, the ISU and the athlete herself.""If Ms. Barquero did not agree with the proposed sanction, she was not obliged to sign the case resolution agreement and was free to take the case forward for hearing at CAS,"" WADA said.The agency had sought to ban Sinner, a three-time Grand Slam champion, for at least one year. It had challenged a decision last year by the International Tennis Integrity Agency not to suspend Sinner for what the ITIA judged was accidental contamination of the banned anabolic steroid last March.WADA formally withdrew its appeal saying it accepted the athlete's explanation for the cause of the violation, and that Sinner did not intend to cheat.Sinner's explanation was that trace amounts of Clostebol in his doping sample was due to a massage from a trainer who used the substance after cutting his own finger.Barquero's Instagram account republished several stories calling attention to the discrepancy in the punishment given to her and to Sinner. She then posted a video talking about how her lengthy suspension had affected her.""It's a disproportionate sanction that meant the end of my career,"" she said. ""I believe it serves as a clear example of the failures of the system. I really don't know what happened. But I have to assume the consequences, accept the current regulations and face sanctions that sometimes are extremely disproportionate.""The 23-year-old Barquero said she decided to accept the six-year ban based on ""unfair rules"" and so she could start moving on with her life.She said the trace amounts of Clostebol showed up in her results through the contamination of a cream commonly used to treat skin wounds that is sold in Italy without prescription and not intended to improve sporting performance.""I had the misfortune of accidentally contaminating myself with a cream that a colleague had bought and that was used by people close to me,"" she said. ""I couldn't imagine that to test positive all you have to do is touch a person who has used that cream, or touch an object that was in contact with the cream.""","Top-ranked tennis player Jannik Sinner received a much shorter doping ban than the six-year suspension it handed to a Spanish figure skater in a similar doping case.

Anti-doping agency's inconsistencies lead to zero trust among fellow pros following Sinner 'resolution'

DUBAI: Jessica Pegula threw her arms up in frustration trying to get a handle on the World Anti-Doping Agency 's (WADA) decision to enter into a 'case resolution agreement' with world No.1 Jannik Sinner, who tested positive for Clostebol last March.Pegula, ranked five, speaking on the sidelines of the Dubai Duty Free tennis, a WTA 1000 event, argued that no matter which side of the divide one fell, whether people thought Sinner was guilty or not, ""the process seemed not to be a process"".""Whatever factors they take into consideration they make up their own ruling, I don't really understand how that's fair for athletes, there's just so much inconsistency,"" Pegula said of the agency, which until last week appeared to be pulling for at least a year-long ban.WADA, who lodged an appeal at the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) in September, was initially looking at a period of ineligibility of between one and two years for the Italian. With the date for the appeal of the 'no fault or negligence' ruling of the International Tennis Integrity Agency set for mid-April, WADA tossed a curveball on Saturday, handing the 23-year-old a threemonth suspension that ends on May 4.Sinner, who has maintained he's innocent, saying the drug had entered his system when his physiotherapist, who had used the cream on himself, had subsequently massaged him. ""I have always accepted that I'm responsible for my team, on that basis I have accepted WADA's offer to resolve these proceedings on the basis of a three-month sanction,"" Sinner said in a statement.On the morning after, the bulk of the tennis community questioned WADA's decision, with the likes of the former British No.1 Tim Henman calling the length of the ban, which allows Sinner to return to the Tour in time for the Masters 1000 event in Rome, as convenient.""We get these emails explaining why this happened,"" Pegula, who is part of the WTA Players' Council, said. ""It's like I can give a reason and explain a million different ways to make it sound right. The process is broken, it needs to be seriously considered. They have so much power to ruin someone's career, something needs to be done about that because it seems unfair.""Pegula, whose parents Terry and Kim own the Buffalo Bills (NFL), Buffalo Sabres (NHL) and Buffalo Bandits (Lacrosse), is no stranger to the business of sport. The 30-yearold underlined that the number of players who had trust in the process was ""zero"".""It's a horrible look for the sport when there's so much inconsistency with player rulings,"" she said, ""I don't know what to think. The past couple years there seems to be no rhyme or reason for whatever they decide. So, I'm not really that shocked that there all of a sudden is a settlement.""Aryna Sabalenka, the world no.1 and top seed in Dubai, said the recent positive tests of Sinner and Iga Swiatek had made her wary. ""You start to be more careful,"" the 26-year-old Belarusian said, ""before I wouldn't care, I would leave a glass of water in a restaurant and go to the bathroom. Now I'm not going to drink (from) the same glass. These things get to your head, if someone uses a cream on you and you test positive, they're going to go for you. You become scared of the system.""""I don't see how I can trust the system,"" added Sabalenka.","Jessica Pegula questions World Anti-Doping Agency's decision on Jannik Sinner.

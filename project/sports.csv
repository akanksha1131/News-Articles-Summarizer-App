Poll What do you think about Australia's achievement of a 5-0 T20I series whitewash against West Indies? Historic and impressive A sign of dominance Unexpected outcome

Australia etched their name into the history books by becoming the first team to whitewash a full-member nation 5-0 in a five-match T20I series. The feat was sealed with a composed three-wicket win over West Indies in the final game of their Caribbean tour.Having already secured the Test series 3-0, the Australians wrapped up their eight-match tour unbeaten with an emphatic 8-0 clean sweep that underlines their dominance across formats.The visitors won the toss for the eighth time in a row and chose to bowl first. West Indies, despite flashes of aggression from Shimron Hetmyer (52 off 31) and Sherfane Rutherford (35 off 17), were bundled out for 170 in 19.4 overs. Australia’s attack remained sharp, with Ben Dwarshuis (3-41), Nathan Ellis (2-32), and Adam Zampa (1-20 in his 100th T20I) keeping the hosts in check.The chase wasn’t smooth sailing. Australia were rattled early by Jason Holder and Alzarri Joseph, slipping to 29/3 inside three overs. Holder struck twice in one over, including the dismissal of Glenn Maxwell for a golden duck, while Joseph knocked over skipper Mitch Marsh and later claimed the dangerous Tim David.However, a brisk 63-run stand between Mitchell Owen (37 off 17) and Cameron Green (32 off 18) turned the game.The duo launched a counterattack with sixes flying into the stands, including one that Owen smashed onto the pavilion roof.Akeal Hosein briefly revived West Indies’ hopes with a tidy spell of 3/17, removing Owen, Green, and Dwarshuis. But Aaron Hardie’s unbeaten 28 ensured Australia crossed the line with three wickets in hand and three overs to spare.The series sweep not only highlights Australia’s T20 depth but also sets a new benchmark in bilateral T20I dominance between full-member nations.",Australia become the first team to whitewash a full-member nation 5-0 in a five- match T20I series.

NEW DELHI: India's dramatic escape in the fourth Test at Old Trafford not only kept the Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy alive but also slightly improved their position in the World Test Championship (WTC) 2025-27 standings — though they still have ground to cover.After conceding a daunting 311-run first-innings lead and being reduced to 0/2 in the second innings, India rode on centuries from Shubman Gill, Ravindra Jadeja and Washington Sundar to bat out five sessions and draw the Test. While the series score remains 2-1 in England’s favour going into the Oval finale, the WTC points table has also seen a mild shake-up.Both teams earned four points for the draw. India moved from 12 to 16 points and maintained their fourth place on the table with a Points Percentage (PCT) of 33.33. England, who now have 26 points, actually dropped from second to third due to a two-point penalty for a slow over-rate offence committed during the Lord’s Test.

NEW DELHI: Ravindra Jadeja Washington Sundar , and Shubman Gill struck brilliant centuries as India battled their way to a morale-boosting draw in the fourth Test on Sunday. Starting their second innings 311 runs behind, India defied the odds on a fifth-day pitch, thanks to Gill (103), KL Rahul (90), Jadeja (107*), and Washington (101*), who all stood tall with the bat.With the series now standing at 2-1 in England’s favour, the fifth and final Test will be played at The Oval in London from July 31.While India’s gritty batting display took centre stage, the match wasn’t short on drama—especially the series of ‘handshake’ incidents that stirred controversy on the final day.In the final hour of play, England skipper Ben Stokes offered a handshake, effectively suggesting the match be called a draw.Indian batters Ravindra Jadeja (on 89) and Washington Sundar (on 80) declined the offer.The refusal frustrated Stokes and several England players.Stokes approached the umpire with the suggestion, but Jadeja and Sundar, both nearing centuries, chose to continue batting.Moments later, stump mics caught a verbal exchange between Harry Brook , Zak Crawley, and Jadeja.Crawley and Ben Duckett were seen questioning India's intent to play on.Stokes sarcastically asked Jadeja, “Do you want to score a hundred against Harry Brook?”Jadeja calmly responded, “I can't do anything.”Despite the remarks, Jadeja stayed composed and continued batting with a smile.In what seemed like a mark of protest, Stokes handed the ball to Harry Brook.Jadeja responded by smashing Brook for a six to reach his third Test century.Washington Sundar soon followed, bringing up his maiden Test hundred.Their centuries capped off a remarkable comeback and helped India draw the Test.Despite the earlier tension, Stokes eventually shook hands with both Jadeja and Sundar after the match ended in a draw.Shubman Gill later revealed that the decision to bat on came from Jadeja and Sundar themselves.“They batted brilliantly and were in their 90s. We felt they deserved their hundreds,” said Gill.He added, “Every match going till the last session on the last day. So many learnings. Each Test teaches you something new.”","Ravindra Jadeja, Washington Sundar, and Shubman Gill hit centuries as India battled their way to a morale-boosting draw in the fourth Test on Sunday.

CHENNAI: India allrounder Washington Sundar had to wait nearly four-and-a-half years to notch up his maiden Test century.It could not have come at a better time for the 25-year-old, who made a terrific Test debut in India’s famous Brisbane win in 2021 but did not follow it up with the bat. Against England in Manchester on Sunday, Washington brought his best game to the park as he showed that he can be relied upon in the middle-order.The strong signs of improvement, including the unbeaten 101 in the drawn fourth Test, are there for everyone to see, thanks to a “shift in Washington’s mindset”. M Senthilnathan, coach of TNCA first-division team Globe Trotters SC and Washington’s mentor at the MRF Pace Foundation, said that the southpaw worked on his mental game ahead of the series.“After his IPL stint with Gujarat Titans, I told Washi: ‘T20s are over.’ I asked him to forget about the T20 format and change his mindset. In T20s, there is more emphasis on power hitting than technique, so he had to focus more on his technique going into the England series. We just had to bring him back to Test-cricket mode,” Senthilnathan, also the new Tamil Nadu men’s team coach, told TOI.“It is important to leave the ball when required; there is no need to hit every ball, like in T20 cricket.I tried to put these basic things into his mind,” added Senthilnathan.During his stellar unbroken union with fellow centurion Ravindra Jadeja on the fifth day, Washington showed stomach for a fight and was hardly troubled by the English bowling attack. Sticking to his strengths and controlling his emotions in key moments helped Washington stay at his best, according to Senthilnathan.“Washi is a very smart and level-headed batter. He can leave the ball when he wants… he can defend when he wants. He can flick the ball to mid-wicket, drive straight down the ground and over extra cover. He also has the height to punch the ball off the back foot. He just played to his strengths,” said Senthilnathan.“Washi also controlled himself well. For example, one loses temperament when the ball takes the outside edge; it is natural. You get tempted to do something. But he did not do that. If he continues to play the same way, he will be successful.”Praised by legendary Australian Glenn McGrath – MRF Pace Foundation director – as a “talented red-ball batter with enough time to play the fast bowlers”, Washington now has the task of backing up his superb knock with consistency.",India allrounder Washington Sundar scored his first Test century in four-and-a- half years.

Poll Should Navjot Singh Sidhu's criticism of Jadeja be taken seriously? Yes, he is a credible source. No, he is being too harsh.

Former Indian cricketer Navjot Singh Sidhu has criticized all-rounder Ravindra Jadeja for his inability to win Test matches for India in overseas conditions, despite Jadeja's recent unbeaten century of 107 runs in Manchester that helped India secure a draw in the fourth Test against England at Old Trafford.Jadeja's innings proved crucial in Manchester as he tackled the uneven bounce on the final day, with Washington Sundar providing support from the other end. The partnership helped keep the series alive for India.""I have praised Jadeja a lot. Kapil Dev was a bowling all-rounder, and he won a lot of Tests for India in overseas. But Jadeja has done well in the supporting role away from home. He bowls his overs quickly and executes restrictive bowling, but he is unable to win Test matches, and it has been evident since the first Test,"" Sidhu said on his YouTube channel.The criticism of Jadeja intensified after India's recent 22-run defeat at Lord's. Both teams had scored 387 runs after day three, but the Lord's pitch became challenging in the last four days.India managed to bowl out England for 192, setting themselves a target of 193 runs. However, England's fast bowlers, led by Ben Stokes and Jofra Archer, reduced India to 58/4 and later 112/8.Jadeja, who remained unbeaten on 61, was the last recognized batsman with India still needing 81 runs for victory.He attempted to fight alongside tail-enders Jasprit Bumrah and Mohammed Siraj.The match ended when spinner Shoaib Bashir dismissed Siraj, with the ball's overspin causing it to hit the stumps. India ultimately fell short by 22 runs.During the resistance, Jadeja's approach was notably conservative, as he avoided rotating the strike or attempting boundary shots.Former India captain Mohammad Azharuddin suggested that a more positive approach from Jadeja could have resulted in India leading the series 2-1 instead of facing a deficit.Jadeja's performance has been a topic of discussion among cricket experts, with many questioning his ability to deliver match-winning performances in challenging overseas conditions.",Former Indian cricketer Navjot Singh Sidhu has criticized all-rounder Ravindra Jadeja for his inability to win Test matches for India in overseas conditions.

Poll Do you think Ajinkya Rahane's concerns about the bowling department are justified? Absolutely, he is right. Not really, they are doing fine.

Former India captain Ajinkya Rahane has expressed concerns about India's bowling department ahead of the fifth and final Test against England in the Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy at The Oval on Thursday. Despite India's impressive batting performance throughout the series, which includes 11 centuries matching their 1978-79 record against West Indies, they trail 1-2 after four Tests.India's batting lineup has demonstrated exceptional form throughout the series, starting with the opening Test at Headingley. Despite losing the match, India produced five centuries, with Yashasvi Jaiswal scoring 101, Shubman Gill contributing 147, Rishabh Pant scoring 134 and 118, and KL Rahul adding 137.""The India team is playing well, and the batting unit has been fantastic. What concerns the Indian team is the bowling department. A couple of bowlers are bowling well, but they are not getting the support,"" Rahane said on his YouTube channel.The second Test in Birmingham saw Shubman Gill's outstanding performance, where he scored 269 and 161 in consecutive innings, helping India level the series 1-1.At Lord's, KL Rahul scored a gritty 100, but India lost the match, falling behind 2-1 in the series.The fourth Test in Manchester ended in a draw, keeping India's hopes alive. Gill continued his remarkable form with 103, while Ravindra Jadeja and Washington Sundar remained unbeaten on 107 and 101 respectively. Their unbroken 203-run partnership proved crucial in saving the match.The batting conditions in England have favored the batsmen throughout the series. The difference in bowling performance between the two teams is minimal, with England claiming 70 wickets compared to India's 65 across the four Tests.India suffered defeats at Headingley and Lord's, where England's bowling proved superior. However, they managed to force a draw at Old Trafford in Manchester, setting up an exciting finale in London.The series now moves to The Oval for the decisive fifth Test, with India looking to address their bowling concerns and level the series.","Former India captain Ajinkya Rahane has expressed concerns about India's bowling department.

You guys see it as a drop; for them, it’s about ‘picking the right team.’ If someone is dropped, he is dropped,” Manjrekar said on JioHotstar.“I feel India has done well despite some of his (Gambhir’s) tactical decisions. Let’s not forget: India lost 3-0 at home to New Zealand and lost comfortably to Australia away. The fight we’ve seen in this team? That’s down to the players. Because tactically, Gambhir hasn’t always made things easier — especially with some of his selections,” he added.Manjrekar also urged Gambhir to relax a bit, saying he always appears to be in a combative mood.""It’s not about ‘you guys think’ and ‘we think’ – we’re all part of the same industry and the same country.

No Indian has ever featured in Romania’s top two leagues before.Moving from India to play professional football at the European stage, Harshika is following in the footsteps of Bala Devi, Manisha Kalyan and Aditi Chauhan. Her signing isn’t just about international firsts; it’s also one of persistence, late-night training sessions, lockdown drills, and a young girl breaking into all-boys’ teams.Harshika’s football journey began at school, where she could always be found on the football ground. And she could be spotted quite easily, too, as she would be the only girl training with boys. It was the same in her locality, where she would always have to play with the other boys as no girls joined it.The move to Romania came through trial at Olimpia Gherla, where she impressed legendary coach Mirel Albon, the man behind Romania’s rise in women’s football.After 20 days of trial, the club offered her a contract.“It feels like family here,” Harshika told TOI. “And that’s important to me. I’m close to my family, and the club environment reflects that. They’ve welcomed me with open arms.” Despite going global, her dream remains rooted in national colours. “Wearing India’s jersey, that’s the dream. Always has been.”","Harshika Jain became the first Indian footballer to sign with a Romanian firstdivision club, joining Atletic Olimpia Gherla.

Lionel Messi and Jordi Alba of Inter Miami have been suspended by Major League Soccer for missing Wednesday's All-Star game, making them ineligible for Saturday's match against FC Cincinnati. The league announced the suspension on Friday, enforcing its policy that requires selected players to participate in the All-Star game unless they have valid reasons for absence.The duo withdrew from the showcase event early Wednesday without revealing their reasons. The game was set to feature a combined MLS team against players from Mexico's Liga-MX as part of the league's All-Star break.MLS rules mandate that players chosen for the All-Star game must participate unless they have a valid excuse, such as an injury.""Per league rules, any player who does not participate in the All-Star Game without prior approval from the league is ineligible to compete in their club's next match,"" the league stated.MLS Commissioner Don Garber described it as a challenging decision to enforce the suspension.""I know Lionel Messi loves this league. I don't think there's a player -- or anyone -- who has done more for Major League Soccer than Messi.I fully understand, respect, and admire his commitment to Inter Miami, and I respect his decision. Unfortunately, we have a long-standing policy regarding participation in the All-Star Game, and we had to enforce it. It was a very difficult decision.""Garber indicated the league would review its existing policy.""We're going to take a hard look at the policy moving forward. I'm committed to working with our players to determine how the rule should evolve.""The Commissioner acknowledged the demanding schedule Messi has faced, noting that the 38-year-old Argentine has played nine games in 35 days, including four FIFA Club World Cup matches.""Miami's had a schedule that is unlike any other team. Most of our teams had a 10-day break. Miami hasn't. So we have to manage through that as a league,"" Garber said.The situation had been anticipated when Miami coach Javier Mascherano expressed his preference for the players to rest instead of participating in the All-Star game. ""The players are called up. I'd prefer they rest, but it's not my decision,"" Mascherano had stated last weekend.","Lionel Messi and Jordi Alba of Inter Miami have been suspended by Major League Soccer.

The All India Football Federation may not have found its next head coach yet, but the hiring process has already delivered an unexpected twist in Xavi Hernandez. The iconic Spanish midfielder and former Barcelona manager, was among the 170 applicants for the job.The application, sent from Xavi’s personal email and highlighted in green in the official shortlist, took officials by surprise. “Yes, Xavi’s name was there. The application was emailed to the AIFF,” national team director Subrata Paul told TOI earlier. However, the technical committee did not pursue his candidacy further due to the significant financial implications.Beyond Xavi, the federation received interest from a mix of coaches with some well-known in Indian circles and others with global pedigree. The list included former India coach Stephen Constantine, Slovakia’s Stefan Tarkovic, Liverpool legend Harry Kewell, ex-Blackburn boss Steve Kean, and familiar ISL faces such as Kibu Vicuna, Eelco Schattorie, and Khalid Jamil. Of those, Constantine, Tarkovic, and Jamil have been shortlisted, with Jamil being the lone Indian contender.Xavi’s CV speaks for itself. A product of Barcelona’s famed La Masia academy, he made over 700 appearances for the club, winning eight La Liga titles, four Champions League crowns, and playing a key role in Spain’s World Cup win in 2010 and Euro triumphs in 2008 and 2012.As a coach, he won league titles with both Al Sadd in Qatar and Barcelona, including the 2022–23 La Liga and 2023 Spanish Super Cup before stepping down in 2024.While the AIFF couldn’t afford him, Xavi’s application is seen as a sign of the growing international appeal of Indian football.

NEW DELHI: All India Football Federation (AIFF) president Kalyan Chaubey on Thursday assured franchises, players, coaches and other stakeholders that the Indian Super League (ISL) would take place this season, potentially with a slight delay due to ongoing litigation in the Supreme Court.Chaubey also said that a new head coach for the Indian men’s football team would be named within the next 10 days after the technical committee submits the names of three shortlisted candidates – GreekCypriot Stephen Constantine, Slovakia’s Stefan Tarkovic and home-grown Khalid Jamil – to the AIFF’s executive committee (EC) on Wednesday.“If the league doesn’t take place, not only footballers but the people who are associated with football will be affected.

It wasn’t just Jaguar TCS Racing’s Nick Cassidy who held his top position in London. Mahindra Racing’s Nyck de Vries also secured back-to-back podiums by finishing second in both races at the London E-Prix. His strong performance at the ExCeL Arena helped Mahindra finish fourth in the Formula E Teams’ Championship and fifth in the Manufacturers’ Championship. He was joined on the podium on Sunday by Envision Racing’s Sébastien Buemi.Nyck de Vries’ double podium in London brought his season tally to three, having also finished second in Monaco. Reflecting on his second consecutive podium, de Vries said, “It was certainly a very challenging race. Obviously, Nick [Cassidy] didn’t want to get too low on energy compared to everyone behind, so he was making sure he stayed on the same energy level as us. That resulted in a bit of a concertina effect behind us. ”He added, “I’m very pleased to bring home another podium and secure P4 for our team, because they’ve done an incredible job. To think that last year we qualified last on merit, and now we’ve come such a long way to finish fourth in the championship — this is a great effort.I’m very proud of everyone at Mahindra.”Envision Racing’s Sebastien Buemi also earned his third podium of the season in London, finishing third behind Nick Cassidy and Nyck de Vries in Sunday’s Round 16. In a heartwarming moment, his three sons joined him on the podium. Buemi had previously won the Monaco E-Prix and taken a podium in Jakarta.Speaking about ending the season on a high while many others were caught in collisions, Buemi said, “In the end, it was important to not get caught up in those incidents. I think I was lucky enough to avoid them well. I saved quite a bit of energy at the beginning, and that basically allowed me to take Attack Mode properly. So, in the end, I’m very happy with that. It’s good for the Teams’ Championship, and it’s satisfying to finish strong and score good points after a tough qualifying. ”Also Read: Nick Cassidy bids Jaguar farewell, celebrates with girlfriend Nathalia Soliani at London E-Prix afterparty At the end, Nick de Vries stood in eighth and Sebastien Buemi in twelfth position in the Formula E Driver Standings.","Mahindra Racing’s Nyck de Vries secured back-to-back podiums by finishing second in both races at the London E-Prix.

Nick Cassidy takes third spot in Driver Standings

N ick Cassidy seems to have all the luck on his side as he went on to win his third race of the season, just days after announcing his exit from Jaguar TCS Racing at the end of this season. The New Zealander won the London E-Prix Round 15 race at the ExCeL Arena on Saturday. He himself called the win “unbelievable,” which was also witnessed by his grandmother at the circuit. Not only that, he also secured a front-row start for the Round 16 race on Sunday.Nick Cassidy himself was in disbelief over his third win and said, “It’s unbelievable! To win here at home for Jaguar and our team, in front of a lot of our friends, family, and partners who are here today, is incredible.”Talking about their strategy and the car, he said, “I wasn’t the happiest guy this morning, but that was for a reason, and I knew we had good potential in the car. In that race, I was able to show that, which is pretty cool.To be honest, it was a little bit fluid — a huge shoutout to my strategy team. I was really scared about not coming out of the pits after Pit Boost in the lead of that second group, and it was tight, but I was able to hang on there, and that’s what made the race.It meant that we could do the Attack Modes later, which was really powerful.”Nick Cassidy also shared a video montage of his podium celebration, where he sprayed champagne and celebrated with his team and family. He wrote, “Parked it in Victory Lane in London! That was incredibly special and will take a while to sink in. One more race today to finish off the season @jaguarracing.”The official social media pages of Formula E also shared a video featuring Cassidy’s grandmother, who witnessed his victory at the London E-Prix.

The victory was even more special for Cassidy, who had announced that he would be leaving the team after the season wraps up on Sunday. He also pushed Taylor Barnard to fourth by taking the third place in the Formula E Driver Standings.In a message to Jaguar TCS Racing after clinching his third win of the season, Nick Cassidy said, “I take back every single little thing I said about strategy today because I got it completely wrong, and you guys got it completely right. It’s an honour to drive for you. Thank you so much. That one was for you guys.”Cassidy was followed by Mahindra Racing’s Nyck de Vries, who secured second place on the podium — his second of the season. He had started from the front row and managed to hold his ground. TAG Heuer Porsche’s Pascal Wehrlein finished third, adding another podium to his season. He currently sits second in the Formula E Drivers’ Standings behind championship leader Oliver Rowland.Maserati MSG Racing’s Stoffel Vandoorne finished fourth, followed by Andretti’s Jake Dennis in fifth.

Championship leader Rowland finished 11th.The race saw early drama when DS Penske’s Maximilian Günther hit the wall right after the start, triggering a pile-up that also involved McLaren’s Taylor Barnard and Sam Bird, as well as Lola Yamaha ABT’s Zane Maloney.Near the finish line, Cupra Kiro’s Dan Ticktum also crashed into the wall and retired from the race. Earlier, Ticktum had made contact with Mitch Evans’ Jaguar, causing Evans to spin and lose his lead — ultimately finishing 10th.Also Read: Nick Cassidy to bid farewell to Jaguar TCS Racing after London E-Prix: “It’s been an incredible two years together” The London E-Prix Round 16 race will take place on Sunday at the same time.

Kush Maini is a pro when it comes to cricket knowledge

Who is Kush Maini?

Mahindra Racing’s Indian Formula 2 champion Kush Maini is not just an impressive presence on the track but also well-versed in his country’s favourite sport — cricket. The racer from Bengaluru recently took a cricket quiz and nearly scored a perfect 10/10, answering almost every question with precision. He is the only Indian to have won a Formula 2 race in Monaco and recently delivered an impressive performance at the Berlin Rookie Test, finishing among the top three in both sessions.A video of Kush Maini’s cricket quiz shows him getting momentarily confused with the first question, though he gave the correct answer initially. When asked about the number of players in a cricket team, he initially said “eleven” but changed it to “twelve” after counting the number of openers and following players.After that brief hiccup, Maini breezed through the quiz like a pro. He correctly answered questions about the criteria for a four and a six, and explained terms like LBW, duck, and clean bowled. He also knew the number of overs bowled in T20, One-Day, and Test matches.When asked which team Virat Kohli represents in the IPL, Maini confidently replied, “RCB… that’s me, can’t get that wrong.” He also tackled a question about the British singer who joked about not understanding cricket despite coming from the country that invented it.Maini answered “Ed Sheeran” — and was pleasantly surprised to learn he was right. He also knew that David Beckham was the English footballer who once played a friendly match with Sachin Tendulkar.Watch Kush Maini’s candid video here Kush Maini moved to England at the age of 13–14 to pursue racing. Originally from Bengaluru, he now spends more time abroad than in India. He became the first Indian to win the prestigious Monaco Grand Prix in Formula 2 earlier this year.He recently showcased his racing talent during the Berlin Rookie Test, representing Mahindra Racing. He finished second in the morning session and third in the afternoon. Speaking after the test, he said, “In the morning, we focused on 350kW runs, and in the afternoon, more on race runs. Whatever the run, we were always in the top three and really fast, so a good step was made. Whenever I get into this car, I leave with a smile on my face. ”Also Read: Berlin Rookie Test standouts Gabriele Minì and Kush Maini share insights after impressive runs Maini continues to shine on the track and, following his impressive performance in Berlin, may even join Formula E one day.","Kush Maini is the only Indian to have won a Formula 2 race in Monaco.

FIA and Formula E comment on agreement extension



In good news for Formula E, a multi-year agreement extension has secured the rights to the FIA Formula E World Championship for an additional 10 years from 2038, when the current agreement ends. This ensures a long and thrilling future for the FIA Formula E World Championship. The long-term extension will enable Formula E to grow further, build strategic long-range partnerships, and drive greater fan engagement.At present, Formula E continues to focus on its phased development strategy for its racing cars — delivering faster top speeds, greater acceleration, enhanced aerodynamics, and improved tyre performance. These developments highlight the series' increased relevance to consumers and the wider EV market, with greater “race to road” technology transfer.With electric vehicle sales projected to rise to over 40% of global vehicle sales by 2030, and global lithium-ion battery production expected to triple by 2030, the relevance of Formula E and its technological advancements is more critical than ever. The Formula E GEN3 Evo already represents a step-change in performance: 0–60 mph in just 1.82 seconds (30% faster than a current Formula 1 car), a 200 mph top speed, and nearly 50% of the energy needed to complete a race regenerated during the event.It is designed with sustainability at its core and includes tyres made with 35% recycled materials and bodywork incorporating recycled carbon fibre and natural fibres.Formula E sees the participation of major automotive manufacturers including Porsche, Jaguar, Nissan, Maserati, Stellantis, Mahindra, and Lola-Yamaha. Since its first race in Beijing in 2014, Formula E has grown by 20% year-on-year, reaching around 400 million fans globally and attracting a television audience of approximately half a billion.The Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA), the global governing body for motorsport and mobility organisations, has announced a multi-year extension to its agreement with Formula E Holdings Limited (majority-owned by Liberty Global).Mohammed Ben Sulayem, President at the FIA, said, “The extension of the agreement governing the FIA Formula E World Championship is a fantastic outcome for the sport and a clear reflection of our ongoing strategy at the FIA to foster long-term stability, innovation, and growth across all areas of motorsport.”He further said, “This milestone reaffirms our commitment to innovation, sustainability, and technological progress, which are all central to the Championship’s unique identity and purpose. It also aligns with our broader goal of increasing global participation and driving more accessible motorsport for all. We are delighted to be continuing this journey with Formula E, and I look forward to seeing it grow even further, both on and off the track, in the years to come. ”FIA Chief Commercial Officer Craig Edmondson, said, “Formula E has not only demonstrated impressive growth since its inception, but has also led the way on sustainable innovation in our industry. This is a landmark agreement for the FIA and Formula E, and we are excited to be working with the Championship in the years to come.”Liberty Global CEO Mike Fries said, “We’ve believed in Formula E since day one, and this extension reaffirms our confidence in where it’s headed. This is the motorsport of the future - a championship that combines the very latest technology, close-combat racing, and a mission that really matters.“With the FIA’s continued backing, we can now take the next big steps - scaling the sport, growing its global fanbase, and continuing to push the boundaries of what electric racing can achieve. With this new agreement in place, Formula E is now positioned better than ever to define the future of motorsport - more innovative, more inclusive, more sustainable - and to inspire the next generation of fans, drivers, and partners around the world. ""Also Read: Formula E London E-Prix 2025: Pascal Wehrlein tops FP1, Jake Dennis finishes second Formula E CEO Jeff Dodds also added, “Formula E’s growth since its inception has been nothing short of extraordinary, with hundreds of millions of fans and world-class teams and drivers deciding to choose highly competitive electric racing. This long-term extension of the partnership enables us to continue building the brand, investing in the product and delivering some of the most captivating racing that has made us famous.

Obviously, in the race, it was changeable conditions. I think the team really managed the strategy well.

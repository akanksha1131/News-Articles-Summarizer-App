Poll How significant do you think Josh Hazlewood's absence will be for Australia in the Ashes series? Very significant Somewhat significant Not very significant

Australia have been handed a major setback in their bid to dominate the Ashes series, with pace spearhead Josh Hazlewood ruled out of the remainder of the contest against England. The unfortunate blow coincides with the crucial return of Pat Cummins, who is expected to reclaim the captaincy for next week’s third Test in Adelaide.Head coach Andrew McDonald confirmed on Tuesday that Hazlewood’s prolonged recovery from a hamstring strain had been complicated by a fresh Achilles issue. The 34-year-old had already missed the opening two Tests and will now shift focus toward being fully fit for the T20 World Cup in India and Sri Lanka in February.“Really flat for him. A couple of setbacks that we didn’t see coming,” McDonald said. “We thought he’d play a huge part in the series. But really feel for him that he won’t get that opportunity.”Hazlewood’s absence leaves Australia with a fast-bowling puzzle to solve just as Cummins looks set to strengthen both the attack and leadership. The 32-year-old has not played since July’s tour of the Caribbean due to a lower-back injury but impressed during intense match-simulation workloads at Allan Border Field last week.“This is something we’ve done with Pat before with long-ish layoffs,” McDonald explained. “He simulated pretty much what a match will look like with multiple spells. We feel as though he’ll be as best prepared as can be.”Cummins’ readiness almost pushed him into the Brisbane Test, as selectors debated lifting overs restrictions after rapid recovery progress. However, with the captain returning now, Australia’s pace plans gain a fresh outlook, especially with tight scheduling between the final three Tests.There was more positive news with left-arm quick Mitchell Starc cleared to play in Adelaide despite battling a side niggle during the Brisbane Test. Starc has been in exceptional form, leading the wicket charts with 18 scalps in two matches.Australia are still expected to rotate their pace options, with Scott Boland, Michael Neser, Jhye Richardson and Brendon Doggett all under consideration to share workloads over the packed schedule.While Cummins’ comeback bolsters Australian confidence, Hazlewood’s exit leaves a void that may test squad depth under high pressure. The Adelaide Test now looms not just as a chance to clinch the series, but as a trial of Australia’s adaptability without one of their most experienced strike weapons.",Australia have been handed a major setback in their bid to dominate the Ashes.

Shimron Hetmyer interview: Opens up on hitting sixes, playing T20 leagues and ILT20 experience

The Desert Vipers held their nerve to secure a dramatic victory in the first-ever Super Over in ILT20 history, defeating the Gulf Giants at the Dubai International Stadium. Chasing 180, Sam Curran (44 off 36) and Dan Lawrence (56 off 31) guided the Vipers to level the score, taking the game into a Super Over. The result continued the Vipers’ dominance over the Giants, marking their sixth successive win against them.Despite Azmatullah Omarzai’s impressive four-wicket haul for the Giants, the effort fell short as the Vipers’ lower order contributed valuable runs to keep their chase alive and stretch the match into a thrilling finish.Earlier, the Gulf Giants got off to a flying start. Pathum Nissanka (56 off 29) and Rahmanullah Gurbaz (41 off 31) hammered 14 runs off Naseem Shah in the first over. The duo put up a brisk 50 partnership inside five overs and powered the innings to 58 by the end of the powerplay.Nissanka continued his strong tournament form, bringing up his third straight half-century off just 27 deliveries. He struck Noor Ahmad for his fourth six, but the spinner struck back immediately to send him back, ending a 73-run opening stand.Gurbaz kept the momentum going with support from James Vince, who contributed 25 off 22 balls.Their 54-run partnership was broken by Khuzaima Tanveer, who dismissed Vince and removed Gurbaz shortly after. By the 14th over, the Giants were placed comfortably at 129/3.The Vipers bowlers tightened things in the death overs. Noor picked up his second wicket, sending back Omarzai (20 off 13), while David Payne removed Moeen Ali (11 off 11). The Giants could only add 38 runs in the final five overs, finishing at 179/5.In response, Omarzai and Mark Adair rattled the Vipers early, reducing them to 14/2. Curran and Max Holden (15 off 15) attempted to rebuild, but wickets continued to fall as Haider Razzaq and Nuwan Thushara kept the pressure on. Curran and Lawrence revived hopes with a 60-run stand, before Omarzai’s double strike shifted momentum again.With 13 needed off the last over, Tanveer struck a six before being caught brilliantly by Gurbaz. Vriitya Aravind then held his composure to tie the game and force the Super Over.The Vipers posted 13 in the tiebreaker, and Naseem Shah successfully defended it by restricting the Giants to nine.Reflecting on the win, Sam Curran said, “It has been the trend recently, but I am not complaining — three wins from three.” He also praised Tanveer, adding, “Tanveer has been working extremely hard on his batting in the nets. To hit a six under pressure and then bowl really well are very positive signs.”Gulf Giants skipper Moeen Ali admitted his side missed key moments, saying, “We made a couple of mistakes at the wrong time and allowed them back into the game. When we needed a few good balls, we gave them something to hit. In this format, the game is never over, and it was one we could easily have won.”","The Desert Vipers held their nerve to secure a dramatic victory in the first- ever Super Over in ILT20 history, defeating the Gulf Giants at the Dubai International Stadium.

Mitchell Marsh is likely ending his first-class cricket career with Western Australia, raising questions about his Test future, according to The Sydney Morning Herald.The 34-year-old informed his WA teammates after Sunday's Sheffield Shield match against Victoria about his plans to step away from state-level red-ball cricket . While he plans to officially retire at the season's end, he is not expected to play any more first-class matches for WA.Marsh has played nine Sheffield Shield matches for his state since 2019. In his recent Melbourne game, where he was considered for the Ashes, he scored just 9 and 4. The all-rounder, who started his WA career against NSW in 2009, has indicated to teammates he remains open to Test cricket if selected.His potential Test selection without Shield cricket participation presents challenges. Australia has no remaining Shield fixtures this year, and Marsh will be occupied with the national T20 team before the T20 World Cup when domestic red-ball cricket resumes.""We would be comfortable picking someone, and if you want to put a name to it, Mitch (Mitchell) Marsh, out of white-ball cricket if we felt like that was going to benefit the Test team,"" Australia coach Andrew McDonald said in October, as quoted from The Sydney Morning Herald.""He's the captain of the white-ball team. It's very hard for him to vacate and balance out Test preparation, if he was to be in the window for that,"" McDonald added.""We still haven't given up on Mitch Marsh's Test career.""Marsh, who has faced multiple injuries, seems to be accepting that his Test career might be over.Since his 2014 debut, he has played 46 Tests, with his last appearance against India in Melbourne in 2024. Beau Webster replaced him for the Sydney Test this year.His last red-ball cricket experience was during the 2024 Border-Gavaskar Trophy, where he managed only one double-digit score of 47. This followed his successful 2023 Ashes comeback featuring a memorable century. However, 2025 proved difficult with 283 runs in 15 innings, averaging 18.60 across nine Tests.His overall Test career includes 2,083 runs in 80 innings at 28.53, with three centuries and nine fifties. His highest score is 181, along with 51 wickets at 40.41. His unbeaten 118 at Headingley in the 2023 Ashes remains his career highlight.Australia's next Test match after this summer's Ashes will be against Bangladesh in August next year.In his first-class career spanning 122 matches, Marsh has scored 6,415 runs, including 13 hundreds and 29 fifties, while taking 171 wickets.",Mitchell Marsh is likely ending his first-class cricket career with Western Australia.

Suryakumar Yadav Press Conference: on Sanju, Dube & India’s T20 Gameplan for South Africa

India’s T20I setup is set for a shake-up as Shubman Gill and Hardik Pandya return to the squad ahead of the five-match series against South Africa starting Tuesday at Cuttack. Their inclusion raises immediate questions about the middle order, particularly the role of Sanju Samson , who has seen his position shift in recent months.Samson had been India’s go-to opener last year, forming a productive partnership with Abhishek Sharma . However, with Gill promoted to vice-captain, Samson was moved down the order during the Asia Cup. He has been in fine touch in the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy, scoring 51, 43, 46, and 73, but captain Suryakumar Yadav confirmed the order will remain unchanged, with Gill opening and Samson in the middle.“Sanju did really well when he opened the innings, but Shubman had played before him in the Sri Lanka series, so he deserves to take that spot,” Suryakumar said ahead of the series opener.Adding more competition, Jitesh Sharma is pushing for a spot in the middle order. In India’s last T20I against Australia, Jitesh replaced Samson as wicketkeeper-batter and scored an unbeaten 22 to help India level the series 1-1. His performance puts Samson under direct scrutiny and creates a healthy contest for spots.“We gave Sanju opportunities. He is flexible to bat anywhere from No. 3 to 6, and both [Samson and Jitesh] can play multiple roles.That’s an asset and a good headache for us,” Suryakumar added.The good news for India is that both Gill and Hardik Pandya are fully fit. Hardik missed the Asia Cup final due to a quadriceps injury but returned to action with Baroda in the SMAT, while Gill has recovered from a neck injury sustained in the first Test against South Africa.“Both are looking healthy and fit. Hardik’s return opens up options with the playing XI. Their experience in big games and ICC events will give the side a good balance,” Suryakumar said, signalling that India now has both firepower and flexibility heading into the T20 series.","India's T20I setup is set for a shake-up as Shubman Gill and Hardik Pandya return to the squad ahead of the five-match series against South Africa.

Australia face selection decisions ahead of the third Ashes Test in Adelaide as they aim to secure the series against England.Their commanding 2-0 lead came after an eight-wicket victory in Brisbane on Sunday, with more than a week's break before the next ICC World Test Championship match at Adelaide Oval on December 17.Team captain Pat Cummins is expected to return to the playing eleven. The team management will assess the fitness of opener Usman Khawaja and fast bowler Josh Hazlewood before the upcoming match.The Australian team might consider bringing back experienced spinner Nathan Lyon, who was left out of the Brisbane day-night Test. Marnus Labuschagne has indicated that selectors will prioritise team balance based on Adelaide's conditions.""I'm not a selector, but what I will say is the same way they (selectors) looked at this game, they looked at the game objectively and said what was the best way for us to win this game with all the information we have on pink-ball cricket,"" Labuschagne said, as quoted by the official ICC website.""What plays, what favours it's been (in past Tests). Is it pace or whatever that is or what type of bowler? And then they make the decision.""The potential return of Cummins, Hazlewood, and Lyon could mean disappointment for some players. Michael Neser, Scott Boland, and Brendan Doggett impressed during the Gabba victory.Neser's performance was particularly noteworthy, claiming five wickets in England's second innings. This achievement didn't surprise Labuschagne.""To see him take five wickets with an old ball...it was awesome,"" he added. ""There was a moment earlier in the season where I was just like, 'Man, I hope he gets his chance.'""""I saw the writing on the wall there that there's potential and for him to be able to come in and deliver I think there was little bit of nerves that first innings and then to come out second innings and play that role, get a five-for, I was just so happy.""He just keeps delivering and delivering and we didn't see the best of his batting either and I think that's probably the exciting part as well is he's got a lot to offer with not only the ball but that (batting) and his fielding.""Labuschagne has shown consistency in the first two Ashes Tests. He scored 128 runs with two half-centuries in four innings, ranking as the third-highest run-scorer across both teams.He credited Australia's new opening pair, Jake Weatherald and Travis Head, for easing his role at number three. He also attributed his success to his ability to adapt to different conditions early in his innings.""I pride myself on being able to read the conditions and play what's in front of me and what is necessary at certain times. It's been nice to come off the back of momentum and be able to put the bowlers under pressure from the start of my innings.""I've really enjoyed that but, you know, it's once again, it's each game on its own, trying to read the conditions and read what the team needs.""","Australia face selection decisions ahead of the third Ashes Test in Adelaide.

Poll Do you think Crystal Palace will qualify for the Champions League this season? Yes No

Crystal Palace’s stunning Premier League surge continued on Sunday as they climbed into fourth place with a 2-1 win over Fulham, while Brighton struck in stoppage-time to deny West Ham a vital escape from the relegation zone in a 1-1 draw.At Craven Cottage, Marc Guehi was the hero for Palace, powering home an 87th-minute header that sealed their fourth win in six league outings. The late strike pushed Oliver Glasner’s side above Chelsea and Everton, strengthening what has now become a genuine bid for Champions League qualification.It marks yet another milestone in a remarkable period for the formerly unfancied south London club, who have already celebrated a shock FA Cup triumph over Manchester City last season and lifted the Community Shield against Liverpool earlier this term. They are also pushing through the UEFA Conference League group phase and could soon be preparing for a dream European upgrade.Palace struck first in the 20th minute when Adam Wharton’s smart through ball found Eddie Nketiah, who drilled home past Bernd Leno. Fulham levelled in the 38th minute through Harry Wilson’s stunning outside-of-the-boot finish. Emile Smith Rowe briefly thought he had completed the comeback, but his close-range effort was ruled out after VAR spotted a marginal offside by Samuel Chukwueze.Palace punished that reprieve with Guehi’s decisive finish from a corner.“It makes me proud because the team did not want to defend the draw, we wanted to win and that’s why we got it,” Glasner said, hailing his side’s belief and resilience.Meanwhile, at the Amex Stadium, West Ham were seconds from climbing out of the relegation zone after Jarrod Bowen fired them ahead in the 73rd minute. But Georginio Rutter’s scrappy stoppage-time effort rescued a point for seventh-placed Brighton, keeping them in the European chase while leaving West Ham in 18th place.Manager Nuno Espirito Santo was furious after VAR allowed the equaliser to stand. “It’s hard to take,” Nuno said. “Everybody saw it. We cannot understand how they gave the goal.” Despite the frustration, West Ham’s improved form — one defeat in six — continues to fuel hope for survival.",Crystal Palace moved into fourth place with a 2-1 win over Fulham.

Liverpool coach Arne Slot was still processing Liverpool’s latest setback at Leeds when Mohamed Salah criticised him and the club’s management in a post-match interaction, raising questions about whether his time at Anfield (home ground of Liverpool FC) is coming to an end.Liverpool, the Premier League champions, are dealing with a poor run of four wins in 15 matches across competitions and now face the possibility of a difficult split with one of their most successful players.Only Ian Rush and Roger Hunt have scored more goals for the club than Salah, who has 250. The forward contributed to two league titles, including last season, when he won multiple individual awards as Slot secured the league in his first year.Salah has now said his relationship with Slot has broken down after being kept on the bench for three straight matches.""I'm very, very disappointed to be fair. I have done so much for this club down the years and especially last season,"" Salah told media. ""Now I'm sitting on the bench and I don't know why. It seems like the club has thrown me under the bus. That is how I am feeling. I think it is very clear that someone wanted me to get all of the blame.""Slot had backed Salah through the season despite the 33-year-old struggling for form. Salah has scored five goals in 19 games and has been criticised by pundits for not contributing defensively.Salah and Liverpool were already preparing for a temporary break, with the player set to join Egypt for the Africa Cup of Nations after fixtures against Inter Milan and Brighton this week.Salah suggested the Brighton match could be his last at Anfield.""I’m going to enjoy that game because I don’t know what is going to happen now,"" he said.""I will be at Anfield to say goodbye to the fans and go to the Africa cup.

Saurabh Netravalkar Interview: Gets emotional about playing at Wankhede, for USA; ILT20 and more

Ferran Torres netted a hat-trick, Lamine Yamal scored from the penalty spot, and Roony Bardghji impressed in a rare start as Barcelona stormed back to beat Real Betis 5-3 in La Liga on Saturday. The victory over fifth-placed Betis in Seville stretched Barcelona’s lead to four points over Real Madrid ahead of their home match against Celta Vigo on Sunday.Once a rotation option, Torres has evolved into Hansi Flick’s first-choice striker. The Spain forward now has more starts than Robert Lewandowski, whose playing time at 37 is being managed carefully. Torres leads Barcelona’s scoring charts with 13 goals — 11 in La Liga — trailing only Real Madrid’s Kylian Mbappé, who has 16 in the league.Bardghji made the most of his third start since joining from Copenhagen in the summer. The 20-year-old Sweden winger dazzled with sharp dribbling and provided the assist for Torres’ go-ahead goal before smashing home Barcelona’s third from just inside the box.Lewandowski and Raphinha stayed on the bench, leaving both fresh for Tuesday’s Champions League clash against Eintracht Frankfurt.Betis took the lead early through Anthony in the sixth minute, but Barcelona replied almost instantly.Torres slipped in behind the defence to tap in a pass from Jules Koundé, then added another just two minutes later with a spectacular volley from Bardghji’s cross. Bardghji’s strike in the 31st minute made it 3-1, before Torres completed his hat-trick 40 minutes in with a deflected effort.In a tactical shift, Yamal played centrally rather than in his usual right-wing role. The teenager linked well in midfield and helped create the first goal before calmly converting a penalty in the 59th minute after Marcus Rashford’s effort struck the outstretched arm of Marc Bartra.Betis pulled goals back late through Diego Llorente and a Cucho Hernández penalty after Koundé fouled Abde. Rashford nearly added a sixth for Barcelona on a solo break but dragged his shot wide.Manuel Pellegrini’s Betis entered the match in strong form after beating rivals Sevilla and going eight games unbeaten. They could drop a place if Espanyol secure at least a draw against Rayo Vallecano on Sunday.Barcelona midfielder Fermín López returned as a second-half substitute after missing two matches with a leg injury.Tajon Buchanan and Georges Mikautadze scored as Villarreal beat Getafe 2-0 to stay third, one point behind Madrid.In the Basque derby, Alavés stunned Real Sociedad with a 1-0 win.","Ferran Torres scored a hat-trick as Barcelona beat Real Betis 5-3 in La Liga.

Riding the excitement of the 2026 FIFA World Cup, US President Donald Trump on Friday suggested that American football should be renamed, arguing that the game played with a round ball — soccer — is the sport that truly deserves the name ""football.""""We have a little bit of a conflict with another thing that's called football but when you think about it, shouldn't it really be called ... football, there is no question. We have to come up with another name for the NFL (National Football League),"" Trump said at the World Cup draw.""It really doesn't make sense when you think about it.""In the United States, ""football"" refers to American football — a sport played largely with the hands and vastly different from the game the rest of the world knows as football.Every year, millions of Americans tune in to watch the NFL’s championship game, the Super Bowl. During the event, FIFA President Gianni Infantino reminded the US audience that the 2026 World Cup would be the equivalent of ""104 Super Bowls.""Trump, known for his interest in a variety of sports, has increasingly embraced soccer as the 2026 World Cup — set to be hosted by the United States, Mexico and Canada — draws closer.","US President Donald Trump suggested that American football should be renamed.

NEW DELHI: Defending champions Argentina and strong contenders Spain received favourable draws for the 2026 World Cup during a star-studded ceremony.Lionel Messi’s Argentina will kick off their title defense — following their triumph in Qatar 2022 — against Algeria, before facing Austria and debutants Jordan in Group J.Spain, European champions and among the tournament favorites, will begin their campaign against first-time qualifiers Cape Verde, with Uruguay and Saudi Arabia completing Group H.Two-time winners France face challenging tests in Group I against Senegal and Erling Haaland’s Norway, with the group rounded out by an intercontinental play-off winner from Iraq, Bolivia, or Suriname.For the first time, the draw was structured to keep the four highest-ranked teams apart — meaning Spain, Argentina, France, and England cannot meet before the semi-finals, should they all top their respective groups.Key reactions from coaches after the 2026 World Cup draw in Washington on Friday:Roberto Martinez, coach of Portugal. Drawn with Uzbekistan, a qualifier and Colombia in Group K:""I think contenders is the right word. But I think the favorites are the teams that have won the World Cup before because there is a psychological aspect... I think we have to grow still, but we are full of hope and excitement.""The 1966 team of Eusebio is the reference point for us... We have won the European Championship and the Nations League and now I think it is very important that we should be able to fight for the dream we all have, to do something we have never done before.""On Cristiano Ronaldo's longevity: ""I think the secret he has is that he works every day as if it were the last day of his career... He never loses his hunger, he is an example for all of us. He is our captain, a reference for us, and very important for us.""Walid Regragui, coach of Morocco. Drawn with Brazil, Scotland and Haiti in Group C.""We're playing against one of the favorites (Brazil) right from the start, and they are playing one of the favorites right from the start,"" a confident Regragui said of Morocco's opening match against the five-time World Cup winners.""Whatever happens, Brazil remain Brazil. They are always potential winners. Having one of the potential winners in our group, and to play them in the first game, is never easy. They have picked up one of best coaches in the world (Carlo Ancelotti) with lots of experience -- he will give them serenity. We will try to be up to the task to make our fans proud.""Steve Clarke, coach of Scotland. Drawn with Brazil, Morocco and Haiti in Group C:""Brazil are an institution, if you like, they are one of the top teams. You always want to play against Brazil, so we have the chance to do that and I am pretty sure we will give them a good game.""It will be a tough game as always -- it will be (the) third game in the group. Hopefully we (will) have some points in the bag before we play them, but to get to a World Cup for a country like Scotland, it has taken us a long time to get back here -- 1998 was the last time, so we were determined to get there and do well... Every game in the World Cup is special –- we don't get there very often so every game is special for us.""Bubista, coach of first-time qualifiers Cape Verde. Drawn with Spain, Saudi Arabia and Uruguay in Group H:""We want to show people who we are (and) play with heart, a good attitude and a lot of humility. It is not a matter of being afraid of Spain. I am pleased to be playing against Spain because I played in Spain for (club side) Badajoz. It is just about enjoying the game, against a team we obviously need to be very wary of.""It means a lot for us, for our country –- everyone will be watching. Our country will be better known around the world... We won our qualifying group and we are very proud to be in our first World Cup.""Dick Advocaat, coach of Curacao, also making their World Cup debut. Drawn with Germany,Ivory Coast and Ecuador in Group E:""Three difficult teams for us but in principle every game is difficult. It is exciting to play there at the highest level and we will see what we can do.""One thing is that we have a team with a lot of fighters and I know from experience we are always difficult to beat, so every opponent we come up against will have to play very well. It is exciting for the island, the people are so proud.""","Defending champions Argentina and strong contenders Spain received favourable draws for the 2026 World Cup.

NEW DELHI: Defending champions Argentina and European powerhouse Spain received favourable group draws for the 2026 World Cup during a star-studded ceremony that also saw U.S. President Donald Trump awarded FIFA’s new peace prize.The draw, held at the Kennedy Center in Washington, marked the official countdown to the expanded 48-team tournament, now just six months away.Lionel Messi and Argentina will open their title defense against Algeria, with further group-stage fixtures against Austria and tournament debutants Jordan in Group J.Spain, among the leading contenders and current European champions, will begin their campaign against first-time qualifiers Cape Verde before facing Uruguay and Saudi Arabia in Group H.""All the praise will not weaken us, quite the opposite,"" insisted Spain coach Luis de la Fuente.""We want to do something big at this World Cup and that means making sure we do well in the group stage, then carrying on from there.""Thomas Tuchel's England, seeking to win the World Cup for the first time since 1966, will hope to win Group L that features beaten 2018 finalists Croatia as well as Ghana and Panama.Two-time winners France, meanwhile, face awkward tests against Senegal and Erling Haaland's Norway in Group I, which will be completed by an intercontinental play-off winner from either Iraq, Bolivia or Suriname.For the first time, the draw was done in such a way as to ensure the four highest-ranked nations were kept apart -- Spain, Argentina, France and England cannot meet before the semi-finals, if all four top their groups.However, the path to that stage -- with an extra knockout round now following the group phase -- looks perilous for some of the contenders.If the top seeds all finish first in their groups, England could, for example, find themselves playing co-hosts Mexico in Mexico City in the last 16 and then Brazil in the quarter-finals, before a last-four clash with Argentina.The tournament will be held across the United States, Mexico and Canada from June 11 to July 19, with 16 more teams added to the global showpiece, up from the 32 nations involved in 2022.That means a total of 104 matches, compared to 64 games last time.While the US will host the majority of matches including the final at the MetLife Stadium outside New York, three of the 16 venues will be in Mexico and two in Canada.The three hosts have experienced turbulent relations since Trump came to power but he brushed that aside.""We've worked closely with those two countries, and the coordination and friendship and relationship has been outstanding,"" Trump said after receiving his peace prize from FIFA president Gianni Infantino.""It is truly one of the great honors of my life. It is such an honor to be with Gianni. He has done such an incredible job,"" Trump added.Trump seized the limelight, even dancing when the Village People performed, but Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney and Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum were also in attendance.The event was co-hosted by supermodel Heidi Klum and American actor and comedian Kevin Hart. NFL legend Tom Brady, ice hockey icon Wayne Gretzky and former NBA superstar Shaquille O'Neal were among the stars who helped conduct the draw.Co-hosts Mexico will take on South Africa in Group A in the opening game of the tournament at the Estadio Azteca in Mexico City on June 11.Carlo Ancelotti's Brazil and surprise 2022 semi-finalists Morocco came out together in Group C, which also features Scotland and Haiti.Germany's opponents in Group E will be Ivory Coast, Ecuador and Caribbean minnows Curacao, while Cristiano Ronaldo's Portugal will face Uzbekistan, Colombia and a play-off winner.Co-hosts the United States got a manageable draw, with Paraguay, Australia and a European play-off winner in Group D.The top two teams in each group advance to the last 32, joined by the eight best third-placed teams.""It will be the greatest World Cup ever,"" Infantino claimed. ""This is like 104 Super Bowls in one month -- this is the magnitude of what we are organizing.""Because of the complexity, teams will only learn the full details of their match venues and kick-off times on Saturday.The 12 groups for the 2026 World Cup in the United States, Canada and Mexico from June 11 to July 19, 2026 following Friday's draw in Washington:Mexico, South Africa, South Korea, a qualifierCanada, a qualifier, Qatar, SwitzerlandBrazil, Morocco, Haiti, ScotlandUnited States, Paraguay, Australia, a qualifierGermany, Curacao, Ivory Coast, EcuadorNetherlands, Japan, a qualifier, TunisiaBelgium, Egypt, Iran, New ZealandSpain, Cape Verde, Saudi Arabia, UruguayFrance, Senegal, qualifier, NorwayArgentina, Algeria, Austria, JordanPortugal, a qualifier, Uzbekistan, ColombiaEngland, Croatia, Ghana, Panama","Defending champions Argentina and Spain receive favourable group draws for the 2026 World Cup.

Tom Brady’s witty Instagram message mixes late night dad humor with heartfelt pride for his fast growing teen



Gisele Bundchen’s nostalgic tribute shows how co parenting still thrives through gratitude and emotional memories

Tom Brady marked a milestone this week as his son Benjamin turned 16, and instead of a polished Hollywood style tribute he shared a warm mix of jokes and emotion that showed the lighter side of parenting. His Instagram post opened with “Happy 16th Birthday, my precious forever baby boy Benny!” before showing photos of Ben with him, sister Vivian and older brother Jack. He praised his son for being kind and caring while laughing at how he “still hasn’t learned to fold a laundry basket properly” which made the message feel natural and real. Fans saw a father speaking like any parent overwhelmed at how fast time moves even when you are a sports icon.The birthday also revealed how Brady and former wife Gisele Bündchen continue to balance co parenting with affection even though their lives have changed. Bundchen shared her own post and a throwback picture writing “Happy 13th birthday my sweet angel!” which showed her sentimental side and highlighted the speed of childhood. “You have the biggest, most beautiful heart,” she said while calling motherhood her greatest gift and joy.Both tributes framed Benjamin in their own voices yet pointed to the same truth that watching a child grow remains their biggest privilege.Brady joked about midnight texts and a heavier Uber bill but also talked about how proud he is of Ben’s heart and personality. He said his son leads with kindness and makes every room brighter which added more depth than a simple birthday note. His hopes for “more big moments, great grades and the best year yet” sounded like the goals of any father looking ahead. The relaxed tone helped the post stand out from celebrity greetings because it came across like a family moment not a staged one.Bundchen’s caption captured how often parents long for childhood to slow down while watching their teens race forward. She spoke about wishing Ben could stay small enough to take everywhere which touched followers who relate to the bittersweet flow of time. Her sincere praise showed how their relationship remains grounded in respect. Together their messages illustrated co parenting that continues to place their children first.The posts reminded people that even sports legends and supermodels deal with teens who text at odd hours and avoid chores. They gave a softer look at Brady beyond football and Bundchen beyond the runway as their family navigates the same growing pains as others. The moment struck interest because it was not about fame but connection and change. For readers it became a simple story about parents surprised at how quickly their children grow.Also read: Taylor Swift and Selena Gomez light up Chiefs game as Swift’s bold support for Travis Kelce sends fans into meltdown",Tom Brady and Gisele Bündchen celebrated the 16th birthday of their son Benjamin this week.

Jalen Hurts vs. Chargers : Passing projections and key stats



The Philadelphia Eagles (8-4) have hit a rough patch, dropping consecutive games after a 24-15 loss to the Chicago Bears in Week 13. Despite quarterback Jalen Hurts throwing two touchdowns, the first time since October 26-- Philadelphia’s offense struggled without support from the running game and a faltering defense. Now, the Eagles travel west to face the Los Angeles Chargers (8-4) at SoFi Stadium in a crucial Monday Night Football clash.Hurts enters the matchup aiming to recalibrate the Eagles’ offensive rhythm. With a 114.4 passer rating, 70.2% completion rate, and 20 offensive touchdowns against only two turnovers, he ranks among the NFL’s elite QBs. Since 2000, only five quarterbacks-- including Patrick Mahomes , Russell Wilson, Drew Brees, and Tom Brady-- have produced 20+ offensive touchdowns with two or fewer giveaways in their team’s first eight games. Among them, Hurts is one of three maintaining a 110+ passer rating with a 70%+ completion percentage into their ninth game, showcasing his efficiency and consistency.Hurts has averaged 209.5 passing yards per game this season and has topped 191.5 yards in seven of 12 games. Over the last five outings, he has maintained 203.2 passing yards per game, including two straight games exceeding the 191.5-yard mark. His 7.4 yards per attempt ranks 11th among NFL quarterbacks, while his performance against zone coverage--prevalent in the Chargers’ defense at 82.1% is exceptional, completing 69.8% of passes with a 98.3 passer rating.Philadelphia’s QB also projects 28 pass attempts against Los Angeles, reflecting a likely increase in passing volume due to the Eagles’ recent struggles on the ground and the Chargers’ strong front seven. Historically, Hurts has been pass-heavy in primetime, averaging 31.3 attempts in his last three Monday night appearances. With the Eagles needing offensive production, expect Hurts to shoulder a heavier passing load under the stadium lights.Beyond stats, Monday offers Hurts a personal milestone. Despite defeating 27 of 32 NFL teams as a starter, the Chargers remain undefeated against him, with his sole previous matchup in 2021 ending in a 27-24 loss. Hurts threw for 162 yards, added a rushing touchdown, and gained 62 yards on the ground, yet Los Angeles prevailed behind Justin Herbert’s 356 passing yards and two touchdowns. A victory would mark Hurts’ first against the Chargers and narrow the list of NFL teams he has yet to beat.Also Read: Sophie Rain drops major hint suggesting Bad Bunny’s Super Bowl show will shock viewers with bold new direction","Jalen Hurts and the Philadelphia Eagles face the Los Angeles Chargers on Monday Night Football.

This initiative offers long-term financial support, reflecting the team's deep bond with Kneeland and ensuring his family is cared for. The fund also aims to raise awareness for mental health, honoring Kneeland's legacy beyond football.

Cowboys’ memorial fund shines light on Catalina’s grief, strength, and the life Marshawn Kneeland envisioned

The Dallas Cowboys are grieving one of the most painful losses in recent franchise history. Marshawn Kneeland, a promising 24-year-old defensive end, passed away last month, cutting short a career that had just begun to blossom. But while the football world remembers a rising talent, those closest to him are now focused on someone whose life changed overnight, his girlfriend, Catalina, who is expecting their first child.The team has launched a memorial fund on her behalf, offering long-term financial support as she faces the unimaginable reality of raising their child without him. For many, this effort reflects the kind of family Kneeland built within the Cowboys organization, a bond rooted not just in football, but in loyalty and love.Head coach Brian Schottenheimer revealed the memorial fund just days after the tragic news, underscoring how strongly Kneeland’s story affected the locker room. The initiative wasn’t created as a temporary gesture, but as a promise, one meant to ensure Catalina and her unborn baby are cared for long into the future.A statement shared by Kneeland’s circle on X read, “Marshawn was truly special, and the world was blessed to know him.Our hope is that his story is not remembered by his final moments, but by the light he brought and the awareness his name can bring to mental health.”While Catalina has kept her personal life private, her heartbreak became public after she wrote, “my sweet baby, words could never express how broken I feel, you’re my everything. I’ll love you forever my beautiful angel.” She also shared pride in her roots earlier this year, writing, “I will always be proud of where I come from and of those who sacrificed everything so I could have the chance to dream 🇲🇽 🇨🇴 🫶🏽.”Her posts reflect both love and resilience, qualities that defined her relationship with Kneeland, from cheering on his rookie season to traveling city-to-city in support of his ambitions. Now, her strength will become part of the legacy he leaves behind. Through the fund, the Cowboys and the broader NFL community are sending a message: Catalina and her child are not alone, and Marshawn Kneeland will be remembered not just for his talent, but for the life he was building beyond the field.Also Read: “The strangest marriage”: Aaron Rodgers’ invisible wife Brittani sparks growing skepticism as mystery marriage remains unseen in 2025","Cowboys' memorial fund shines light on Catalina’s grief, strength, and the life Marshawn Kneeland envisioned.

Brittany Mahomes abruptly goes silent after Mahomes and Kelce’s meltdown shakes Chiefs’ season,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/brittany-mahomes-abruptly-goes-silent-after-mahomes-and-kelces-meltdown-shakes-chiefs-season/articleshow/125838189.cms,"Kansas City Chiefs faced a tough loss against the Houston Texans. Quarterback Patrick Mahomes and player Travis Kelce struggled on the field. Brittany Mahomes, wife of Patrick Mahomes, remained silent on social media after the game. This quiet response mirrored the disappointment felt by many fans. The team's playoff hopes are now uncertain.

Kelce struggles, Mahomes takes heat, and Brittany distances herself from the chaos

Brittany Mahomes has never been shy about showing love for the Kansas City Chiefs, especially when her husband Patrick Mahomes takes the field at Arrowhead Stadium. From stadium arrivals to postgame celebrations, her Instagram is often filled with glam snapshots, family moments, and behind-the-scenes excitement. But Sunday’s matchup against the Houston Texans brought a different kind of energy and this time Britney chose not to post at all.After the Chiefs’ 20–10 defeat, the atmosphere among fans turned tense, and the blame quickly fell on both Patrick Mahomes and Travis Kelce for their lackluster performance. Instead of sharing her usual reactions, Brittany went silent, leaving fans to interpret her disappointment without a word.Before kickoff, Brittany seemed poised for another enthusiastic game day, sharing Instagram stories of the stadium buzz. Yet as the game unfolded, Kansas City faltered early and never recovered. Kelce dropped late-game opportunities and the offense struggled to find rhythm, a shock to a fan base accustomed to polished comebacks. Once the loss was sealed, Brittany’s social feed suddenly stopped. No postgame thoughts. No family shots. Just silence.This isn’t the first time her online presence has mirrored the team’s emotional highs and lows.When the Chiefs win, Brittany often floods social media with celebration. But when they lose, fans get nothing at all, a silent statement that speaks louder than her usual hype. Making the night even more unusual, she also wasn’t seen alongside Taylor Swift and Selena Gomez, who attended separately in support of Travis Kelce.With this defeat, Kansas City suffers more than a bruised ego. Their playoff hopes are now hanging by a thread, and for the first time in nine seasons, they’ve lost the AFC West crown, a title now held by the Denver Broncos. Their next game against the Chargers could determine whether their season lives or dies.As frustration among supporters rises, Brittany’s silence reflects what many Chiefs fans are feeling: uncertainty. The once-unstoppable dynasty suddenly looks fragile, and if Mahomes and Kelce don’t turn things around fast, the quiet moment on Brittany’s Instagram may be the least of Kansas City’s worries.Also Read: Brittany Mahomes sends a clear message to fans as they question Patrick Mahomes’ legacy during tough season","Brittany Mahomes has never been shy about showing love for the Kansas City Chiefs.

After a friend's question prompted reflection, Steinfeld is seeking audience input on content for 2026, moving beyond curated celebrity personas. This collaborative approach invites fans into her evolving public journal, fostering a deeper connection as the platform grows.

Hailee Steinfeld invites Beau Society readers to decide what stories she should tell in 2026

As Buffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen hunts for a playoff push, his wife Hailee Steinfeld is tackling a very different kind of challenge, one that has nothing to do with football and everything to do with identity. The actress and singer just released the 63rd issue of her passion project, Beau Society, and used the milestone to make a surprising announcement.Steinfeld revealed that a friend recently asked her where she sees the newsletter in five years, a question that forced her to rethink what she wants this platform to become. Instead of offering answers, the 28-year-old star is turning to her readers to help decide what comes next. For a celebrity used to scripts, stage directions, and studio planning, she’s choosing collaboration over control.Steinfeld openly shared how deeply the question affected her. “At one point, my friend asked me what I wanted Beau Society to be in five years, which made me feel all lit up inside,” she wrote. The newsletter, which launched in August 2024, began as nothing more than a curious experiment, a place where she could write without expectation.She admitted that Beau Society initially felt like a “shot in the dark,” but it soon transformed into a home for unfiltered thoughts about life, relationships, food, travel, and even wedding photos with Josh Allen.Now, she’s ready to hand over part of the creative steering wheel. “It’s important to me that you are involved as we grow in the new year,” Steinfeld wrote. She followed the statement with a poll, asking readers to pick what they want more of, personal essays, lifestyle guides, behind-the-scenes glimpses, casual conversations with friends, and even fan-driven questions.This move marks a noticeable shift in how celebrities build communities. Instead of relying on curated branding teams, Steinfeld is inviting her audience into the process, creating an evolving public journal that grows alongside its readers. As 2026 approaches, longtime subscribers are left wondering whether she will reveal more about her private life with Allen, dig deeper into creative reflections, or pivot toward interactive storytelling.Whatever direction Beau Society takes, one thing is clear: Hailee Steinfeld is no longer just performing for an audience.

Gisele Bündchen's Miami shoot reflects her wellness evolution and message about movement

Gisele Bündchen is proving that discipline, wellness, and movement are more than trends, they’re her lifestyle. The 45-year-old supermodel was spotted on Miami Beach filming a new commercial, and her athletic energy turned heads just as much as her looks. Dressed in a sleek brown sports bra and leggings, Bündchen spent the shoot sprinting, stretching, and striking yoga poses under the Florida sun.Bündchen's toned abs, relaxed demeanor, and confident posture reflected years of training, but what truly stood out was her passion for keeping her body in motion. For Bündchen, working out isn’t just a job requirement, it’s a philosophy she’s committed to sharing with others.The Brazilian icon has long embraced a fitness-forward lifestyle that goes far beyond aesthetics. After practicing yoga, jiu-jitsu, jogging, and weight training for years, she continues to live by habits she once described in Women’s Health. In a 2023 interview, she revealed that she used to wake up before sunrise to meditate, jog, and then head straight into yoga. “Moving is just part of my every day,” she said, a mindset perfectly reflected in her Miami shoot as she performed lunging stretches and posed like a yogi between camera shots.Her wellness journey hasn’t always been this focused. Bündchen has openly admitted that she once indulged in habits like red wine, cigarettes, and mocha frappuccinos. Today, her mantra is more grounded and spiritual: “Our body is our temple, our home, the place we’ve been given.”Recently, she reinforced that message on Instagram, where she encouraged followers to embrace motion. “If there’s one thing I’d recommend to everyone, it’s this: move your body,” she wrote, adding, “Movement is medicine. For your heart, your muscles, and just as importantly, for your mind and soul.”While maintaining her fitness-driven lifestyle, Bündchen has continued to balance motherhood and career growth. After welcoming her third child with jiu-jitsu instructor Joaquim Valente in February, she’s clearly redefining what strength looks like, not just in her physique, but in her priorities. From commercial sets to morning workouts, Bündchen’s life today reflects a message she now embodies: health, movement, and balance aren’t trends, they’re choices.Also Read: Gisele Bündchen finds more freedom with Joaquim Valente after years in Tom Brady’s shadow","Gisele Bündchen, 45, showcased her dedication to wellness and movement on Miami Beach.

“Call off the marriage”: Frustrated Chiefs fans urge Travis Kelce to dump Taylor Swift amid growing blame for Kansas City collapse,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/call-off-the-marriage-frustrated-chiefs-fans-urge-travis-kelce-to-dump-taylor-swift-amid-growing-blame-for-kansas-city-collapse/articleshow/125837492.cms,"Kansas City's recent loss has ignited a bizarre debate, with some fans blaming Taylor Swift for the team's struggles. Despite the pop star's presence, the Chiefs' playoff hopes are dwindling due to on-field issues like offensive inconsistency and defensive adaptations. The real solution lies in the team rediscovering its championship form, not in Swift's attendance.

Blaming Taylor Swift distracts from the Chiefs’ real on-field problems

Kansas City’s latest loss has sparked a loud, bizarre debate, one that has less to do with football and more to do with pop culture. After Travis Kelce ’s disappointing performance against the Houston Texans, some frustrated fans began pointing fingers at someone who wasn’t on the field: Taylor Swift The singer, who attended the game with Selena Gomez, Leonardo DiCaprio, and Lena Dunham, became a trending target on social media as the Chiefs suffered a 20–10 defeat and slipped further from playoff contention. But while online chatter fixates on a supposed “curse,” the real story isn’t about music, celebrity romance, or sideline cameras. It’s about a team in danger of losing its identity after nearly a decade of domination.Kelce’s mishandled pass that turned into an interception was undeniably costly, but pinning it on Swift ignores a much bigger crisis unfolding in Kansas City. The Chiefs now have a 15% chance of making the playoffs and must rely on both winning out and other teams stumbling just to survive the season. That’s not the result of a pop star in the stands, it’s the sign of a franchise struggling to evolve while younger AFC teams rise fast.Kansas City’s offensive chemistry has wavered all year. Miscommunication has plagued the play-calling, wide receiver execution has been inconsistent, and defenses have adapted to suffocating Patrick Mahomes’ rhythm. Even Kelce, despite racking up 719 receiving yards and five touchdowns this season, hasn’t been immune to uncharacteristic errors.Still, some online fans chose humor and in some cases, hostility. One post declared, “It’s looking like the Taylor Swift curse is real KC,” while another asked in a poll whether the team stinks because “the dynasty is over” or “because of Taylor Swift.” Yet many others sympathized with her, joking she might reconsider dating Kelce because of the sloppy football on display.But not everyone blamed Swift. Some fans poked fun at the situation, joking that she might regret her field-level view of a collapsing dynasty. One fan quipped, “Chiefs season so bad, Taylor Swift about to call off the marriage with Kelce.”As rumors swirl about Kelce potentially retiring when his contract expires, the emotional reaction makes sense: Chiefs fans are panicking. But if Kansas City wants to save its season, the solution won’t come from Swift leaving the stadium. It will come from the Chiefs remembering how to play like champions again.Also Read: Justin Baldoni drags Travis Kelce's beau Taylor Swift once again into Blake Lively court fight with bold accusation","Kansas City's recent loss has ignited a bizarre debate, with some fans blaming Taylor Swift for the team's struggles.

Source: X

How did Baker Mayfield ’s wife Emily react to him being fined by the NFL

NFL insider Adam Schefter reported that Mayfield and teammate Bucky Irving were penalized for a post-touchdown celebration that involved the “nose wipe” gesture during last week’s game against the Arizona Cardinals. Mayfield received a fine of $14,491, while Irving was fined $6,349.However, they did not face any on-field penalties, and the Buccaneers went on to secure a 20–17 win over Arizona. But Baker’s wife, Emily Wilkinson, had a rather cheeky response to her husband being fined. She shared a snippet of Baker in his jersey, looking right at the camera and captioned it, “So violent.”NFL vice president Troy Vincent had previously addressed this gesture and had stated that the gesture would be fined as a “violent gesture” due to its “gang connotations.”“[The nose wipe] has gang connotations; it’s disrespectful,” Vincent said in April. “It’s just where we are in society. Young men, they come from that era, from that age, and they’ve grown up on social media. If anybody Googled ‘nose wipe,’ you’ll see the language that is used and where that’s affiliated. I think the players know better. I know they know better.“We’re focusing on a small fraction (of players), but sportsmanship is important… When you see it, you’ve got to kill it.You’ve got to stop it immediately. Most players don’t want it in the game either.”However, fans were amused with Emily’s gesture and agreed with her stance since she seemingly didn’t think he deserved the fine. Emily and Baker first crossed paths in 2017 after being set up by a mutual friend. Six months later, they became engaged and tied the knot in July 2019. They welcomed their first child, daughter Kova Jade Mayfield, in April 2024, and in November 2025, the pair shared that they are expecting their second baby.","Baker Mayfield and teammate Bucky Irving were penalized for a post-touchdown celebration that involved the “nose wipe” gesture during last week’s game against the Arizona Cardinals.

My Two Cents on the Mock Trade: Who Wins the Deal?

The Golden State Warriors are back in the rumor mill, this time linked to a mock trade that sends struggling sharpshooter Buddy Hield and a future second-round pick to the Utah Jazz for forward Georges Niang. The proposed swap, highlighted by Blue Man Hoop’s G.C. Bellchamber, is a near-perfect salary match, Hield at $9.2 million and Niang at $8.5 million, with only minor apron-related maneuvering possibly needed through a third team. With Golden State sitting at a middling 12-12, this potential deal surfaces at a moment when the franchise is actively searching for a spark.The structure of the proposal is simple:• Warriors move Buddy Hield, who is owed $9.2 million this season and has two years left with a player option.• Jazz send Georges Niang, in the final year of his three-year contract originally signed with Cleveland.• Utah receives a second-round pick, likely from 2027 or later.• Golden State gains just over $1 million in salary breathing room, valuable under current second-apron restrictions.Niang has been sidelined since September with a foot stress reaction but is reportedly nearing return-to-play protocols. Despite the injury layoff, his shooting profile and positional fit make him an immediate rotation candidate for a Warriors roster searching for reliability.Golden State Warriors have benched Buddy Hield for extended stretches this season. His 8.0 points per game on 40.4 percent from deep reflect a dip from his usual offensive consistency, and Steve Kerr’s reduced usage signals the team’s shifting priorities. Adding Niang gives the Warriors something they lack: a 6-foot-7 forward who can space the floor without being a defensive downgrade. Niang has logged seven straight seasons above 40 percent from three and brings a steady presence that complements Jonathan Kuminga’s rebounding and Draymond Green’s playmaking.Utah’s rebuilding trajectory, projected around a .200 win percentage and reminiscent of a 17-65 campaign, makes the acquisition of assets more valuable than immediate on-court impact. While Niang is reliable, Hield’s reputation as a high-volume shooter (career 40 percent from deep) could give Utah a scoring punch and a potentially tradeable contract later. The added second-rounder sweetens the deal for a franchise focused on long-term flexibility.Niang’s advanced numbers make the case even stronger. He stacks up closely with players like Klay Thompson (85 similarity score), posts a 60.3 percent true shooting mark, and ranks in the 92nd percentile in offensive portability, meaning he fits almost any system. Hield still offers elite volume with 4.8 threes per game for his career, but his defensive struggles continue to cap his impact.• More consistent shooting from Niang across multiple seasons• Better positional fit for small-ball formations• Neutral salary impact with slight financial breathing room• Georges Niang’s recent foot injury carries some uncertainty• Lower scoring upside compared to Hield’s peak output• Adds a proven high-volume shooter• Gains a second-round pick to bolster the rebuild• Hield’s contract structure could make him easier to flip later• Niang provides steadier defense and floor spacing• Hield’s age and inconsistency reduce long-term valueThis mock trade leans clearly toward Golden State. Hield’s struggles and diminished role have created friction, while Niang’s clean shooting profile and forward size make him a natural fit for the Warriors’ motion-heavy offense. For a team trying to jump-start a dynasty reboot behind Stephen Curry, a move like this feels more practical than splashy, which is exactly what the 12-12 Warriors need.Utah doesn’t walk away empty-handed, securing a shooter and draft capital for a veteran currently injured. But the immediate upside swings heavily toward Golden State.If executed, this deal would represent more of an adjustment than a gamble for the Warriors, a small, calculated move aimed at restoring lineup balance and maximizing Curry’s window. Niang once signed with Golden State in 2017 but was waived before debuting. A reunion eight years later could finally give the Warriors the version of him they hoped for.Also read: NBA trade rumors: Los Angeles Lakers ye $54 million Boton Celtics star as rim-protecting answer next to Ayton for LeBron-Luka title run Whether the Warriors decide to pursue this path or explore bigger options, the premise remains the same: the team needs stability, shooting, and defensive competence. Niang checks those boxes, and this trade framework shows why his name keeps surfacing as Golden State searches for answers.","The Golden State Warriors are linked to a mock trade that sends struggling sharpshooter Buddy Hield and a future second-round pick to the Utah Jazz.

Dwight Howard’s wishlist shapes his final basketball ambitions



Fans shower love for Dwight Howard



Dwight Howard may be nearing the end of an extraordinary journey, but the former NBA superstar refuses to let the final chapter close without one more shot at the spotlight. Fresh off his Orlando Magic Hall of Fame induction and preparing for what could be his last year of professional basketball, Howard has laid out the dream scenario he hopes will define his exit. The eight-time All-Star shared a short, emotional message on social media, hinting at how he wants his career to conclude.The 40-year-old has spent the past few seasons away from the NBA, yet he continues to chase one more run. His recent push includes conversations with LeBron James and Paul George, a renewed commitment to staying in shape, and a belief that he still has something to offer a roster. At the same time, he has embraced opportunities outside the league, all while keeping one wish on his mind as the finish line approaches.Dwight Howard’s six-word message, “A farewell tour would be nice,” captured the sentiment he has carried for months. While speaking with Paul George on Podcast P, he opened up about trying to find a path back into the NBA. “I have not officially retired yet, but I don't know what I'm going to do yet,” he said.He described reaching out to George, who joked about not wanting anyone “over 35 playing center,” and sharing a light moment with LeBron about the Lakers’ evolving plans.Howard recalled LeBron telling him his focus was on Bronny and Bryce joining the organization and “the whole James family” shaping the future in Los Angeles.Despite uncertainty, Howard spoke warmly about his time with the Lakers. “I really enjoyed my time with the Lakers,” he said. “Obviously playing with LeBron, it's a great memory.” He insisted he wanted to keep playing until he felt ready to stop, not when others decided it for him. Howard last suited up in the NBA during the 2021-22 season before spending a year in Taiwan with the Taoyuan Leopards.WWE legend and Hollywood star John Cena’s farewell tour has made headlines and as Howard wished, it appears that the NBA legend is also looking to get similar treatment.Fans online pour heartfelt support.“It aint farewell yet,” @Kingdom_Soldier shared.“Come give the magic 15 min a night. Legend,” @newmanusps1313 wrote.“Dwight I know you can still put up a double double with 2 blocks,” @HectorDelRio13_ added a positive note with Howard’s nostalgic gameplay.“@OrlandoMagic you got the chance to do something ""MAGICAL"" #makeitmagic,” @DreadyKrugah urged Magic to sign Howard for his farewell tour.As of now, Dwight Howard’s potential NBA return remains uncertain. Still, many fans believe a farewell tour for the legend is well deserved.Also Read: Jaylen Brown becomes focus of new NBA announcement following Boston Celtics’ fifth consecutive win","Dwight Howard has laid out the dream scenario he hopes will define his exit.

Pros, Cons, and My Final Verdict on This Mock Trade

Los Angeles Lakers Pros

Los Angeles Lakers Cons

Portland Trail Blazers Pros

Portland Trail Blazers Cons

Why This is a Low-Cost Gamble With Championship Upside

The Los Angeles Lakers have re-entered the trade rumor spotlight as reports link them to Portland Trail Blazers center Robert Williams III, a former All-Defensive anchor who could immediately reshape their frontcourt rotation. The potential move aims to reinforce a roster built around LeBron James and Luka Doncic for the 2025-26 championship chase, while reviving Williams’ brief but productive chemistry with Deandre Ayton from their Portland stretch. Fans have already begun imagining Williams turning the paint at Crypto.com Arena into a no-fly zone.The most realistic blueprint sends Los Angeles Lakers rookie wing Dalton Knecht, veteran guard Gabe Vincent, and a future second-round pick to Portland in exchange for Robert Williams III’s $13.3 million expiring contract. The money aligns cleanly, and the Blazers gain long-term value without taking on additional salary.Portland’s frontcourt crowding around Donovan Clingan and other young bigs encourages a deal like this. While Jarred Vanderbilt or Maxi Kleber have been floated as alternatives, the Knecht-and-Vincent package strikes the right balance, preserving Los Angeles’ core while still delivering an impact defender.Robert Williams III would give Los Angeles Lakers a defensive dimension they’ve lacked behind Ayton. With Ayton carrying scoring and rebounding duties, Williams can focus entirely on rim protection, vertical spacing, and hustle plays.• Elite shot-blocking to complement Ayton’s size• Reliable lob target for Luka Doncic and LeBron James• Reduced defensive workload for James at age 40• Second-unit anchor without draining core rotation pieces• Reunites Williams with Marcus Smart and Ayton, boosting continuityRobert Williams III’s explosive style fits naturally with the playmaking of Doncic and the pacing of LeBron, who continues to post 25-8-8 nights despite his age. Even in limited minutes this season, Williams has delivered 1.7 blocks per game and strong finishing around the rim.The Blazers gain young pieces with upside while avoiding a scenario where Williams’ availability struggles limit his trade value further. Knecht brings positional shooting and scoring flashes, including 20-point bursts in Summer League, while Vincent supplies steady backcourt depth.• Add young, controllable wing scoring• Create minutes for Clingan and other developmental bigs• Collect low-cost picks without adding long-term salary• Avoid luxury tax complications• Reset around a youth-first frontcourt approachWilliams’ injuries are a known issue, with under 40 games in five of seven seasons. Moving him now prevents a worst-case scenario: losing him for nothing.Even in reduced minutes, Williams posts elite per-minute rim protection numbers. His 8.6 percent block rate places him in the league’s top defensive percentile, and his finishing efficiency remains strong.Ayton’s numbers complement the idea well: historically averaging 15.8 points and 10.8 rebounds against the Lakers and now settling into a comfortable scoring role in Los Angeles.• Immediate defensive improvement• Better paint coverage without sacrificing the core• Short-term contract limits financial risk• Perfect fit for Doncic and James’ passing styles• Significant injury risk• Uncertain long-term reliability• Two rotation-ready players• A future pick• Salary relief and room for young bigs• Losing a potential defensive cornerstone• Upside depends on Knecht’s developmentOverall, the Lakers stand to gain the most from this trade. Williams’ defensive ceiling, even at 20 minutes per game, elevates their title aspirations without touching major roster pillars. Portland benefits from youth and flexibility, but Los Angeles walks away with the higher-impact player for the 2026 chase.Also read: NBA trade rumiors: Golden State Warriors could resign $190 million star guard to support Stephen Curry ahead of trade deadline It’s the type of move that signals urgency, ambition, and belief that the LeBron-Luka era can deliver a Hollywood ending.","The Los Angeles Lakers have re-entered the trade rumor spotlight as reports link them to Portland Trail Blazers center Robert Williams III.

RJ Barrett's injury update: Toronto Raptors star's worrying knee setback puts the team in a tricky situation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nba/top-stories/rj-barretts-injury-update-toronto-raptors-stars-worrying-knee-setback-puts-the-team-in-a-tricky-situation/articleshow/125849124.cms,"RJ Barrett is now facing a knee setback (Image via NBA)

RJ Barrett’s knee sprain forces Raptors into another anxious week of waiting as their offence struggles without him

RJ Barrett’s injury blow has pushed Toronto’s already struggling attack into even deeper trouble

Raptors guard RJ Barrett is still out with a right knee sprain sustained on November 23rd against the Brooklyn Nets. Barrett received a platelet-rich plasma injection in his right knee, which should speed up his rehabilitation and allow him to return to the court sooner rather than later.Barrett's condition will be updated in a week, which means he will miss Toronto's next NBA Cup game against the New York Knicks, as well as any future cup games if the team advances. RJ Barrett will be re-evaluated in a week after receiving a platelet-rich plasma injection to address his knee sprain.The Toronto Raptors lost their footing after a strong start to the season, but still remain fourth in the Eastern Conference with a 15-10 record. RJ Barrett has been a key contributor to the Raptors' success, with the team going 3-5 since he damaged his knee.The team's starting shooting guard and leading scorer for the previous two seasons will be out for at least another week due to a sprained right knee. The official notice stated the following:“RJ BARRETT INJURY UPDATE.. The Toronto Raptors announced Monday that guard-forward RJ Barrett, diagnosed with a right knee sprain, continues to progress. He has been treated with a platelet-rich plasma injection, and his condition will be updated in a week…”It continued:“Barrett is averaging 19.4 points, 4.8 rebounds, 3.8 assists and 30.9 minutes in 17 games (all starts) this season.He is shooting .506 (120-237) from the field, including .356 (31-87) from three-point range, and has scored 20 or more points in 10 games..”The Raptors said Monday afternoon that, while Barrett's condition is still improving, he has had a platelet-rich plasma injection and will be evaluated again in a week. Without Barrett, Toronto is missing their finest driver, and the offence has clearly suffered as a result of his absence.Barrett received a platelet-rich plasma injection to address his knee strain, according to Michael Scotto. Barrett will be re-evaluated in the coming week.This season, the Canadian-born forward averaged 19.4 points, 4.8 rebounds, and 3.8 assists over 17 games. For the time being, the Raptors will be without Barrett. Barrett's absence has clearly hampered the Raptors, who have lost five of the eight games he has missed.However, he will now miss Tuesday's NBA Cup quarterfinal game against the New York Knicks, the team that drafted him third overall, as well as the remaining potential semi-final and championship games, all of which will be played in Las Vegas this weekend, as well as additional games.Barrett has averaged 19.4 points, 4.8 rebounds, and 3.8 assists in 17 games this season, while playing 30.9 minutes per game. Toronto has the NBA's worst offensive rating over the last eight games, which corresponds to the number of games Barrett has missed thus far.Also read: Toronto Raptors star Scottie Barnes and Oklahoma City Thunder star Cason Wallace rise quietly to claim NBA’s top defensive honors","Raptors guard RJ Barrett is still out with a right knee sprain sustained on November 23rd against the Brooklyn Nets.

Minnesota Timberwolves Injury Report vs the Phoenix Suns (December 8, 2025)

What’s at Stake in This Western Conference Battle

Thehead into their December 8, 2025 clash with the Minnesota Timberwolves facing one of their most challenging lineup situations of the season. With multiple starters and rotation players sidelined, Phoenix arrives at Target Center knowing that depth and adaptability will shape their chances of competing. Minnesota, meanwhile, enjoys the luxury of near-full health as they look to protect home court and extend their strong run of form.This matchup also comes at a crossroads for both teams in the Western Conference landscape. Phoenix Suns, having dropped four of their last six, seeks stability amid mounting injuries, while Minnesota Timberwolves looks to capitalize on the momentum built by its defensive identity and emerging offensive weapons. With both sides remembering their tight 114-113 duel on November 22, anticipation heightens for another gritty, unpredictable showdown.Phoenix Suns’ injury report paints a worrisome picture for coach Mike Budenholzer, who will be forced to patch together scoring and defensive schemes with several key pieces missing. Devin Booker remains out due to a right groin strain, eliminating the Suns’ leading scoring threat.Jalen Green, still recovering from a right hamstring strain first suffered in November, continues to be unavailable with no immediate timetable for return.To complicate matters further, Dillon Brooks has been listed as questionable after experiencing left Achilles soreness, raising concerns about the availability of the team’s most physical perimeter defender. Isaiah Livers is also ruled out with a right hip strain, thinning Phoenix’s wing depth even more. With four significant contributors sidelined, role players will need to step into unfamiliar responsibilities to keep the Suns competitive.On the Minnesota Timberwolves side, the injury landscape looks far more favorable. The Timberwolves carry a light injury report into the contest, giving them a significant advantage in continuity and chemistry. While Anthony Edwards and Terrence Shannon Jr. were briefly mentioned with illness concerns leading up to shootaround, both were either cleared or deemed minimally impacted.With their core rotation intact, Minnesota leans on the two-way presence of Julius Randle and Jaden McDaniels to exploit the Suns’ compromised lineup. Their recent hot stretch only adds to the confidence heading into a matchup where they hold the health edge and the stylistic advantage.Phoenix Suns’ recent defensive struggles, allowing 113.7 points per game, combined with the absence of Booker and Green could force the Suns into a grinding, low-scoring strategy. Their previous win over Minnesota Timberwolves featured Dillon Brooks’ 22-point spark, making his questionable status a potential turning point. Minnesota’s disciplined defense and overall health tilt the betting outlook in their favor, leaving Phoenix to navigate a harsh stretch defined by injuries, depth tests, and razor-thin margins.This meeting sets the stage for a dramatic night where lineup gaps, momentum swings, and late-game execution may determine who walks away with a crucial December victory.","Phoenix Suns host the Minnesota Timberwolves on December 8, 2025.

LeBron’s hilarious clapback leaves courtside heckler stunned in viral showdown

LeBron James backs up his clapback with cold-blooded clutch heroics

As is customary, the raucous Philadelphia 76ers supporters attempted to get under LeBron James ' skin when the Los Angeles Lakers visited town Sunday night. James answered with a season-high 29 points, seven rebounds, and six assists, including ten consecutive points in crunch time to seal the 112-108 victory.LeBron James recently had a funny conversation with a heckler who made a remark about his hairline during the Los Angeles Lakers' game against the Philadelphia 76ers on Sunday. James also responded to a spectator at courtside who made fun of the NBA veteran's receding hairline.A courtside heckler learnt the hard way that Omar from ""The Wire"" wasn't kidding when he said ""come at the king, you best not miss"" because the spectator tried to mock LeBron James over his hairline, but it hilariously backfired.The entertaining interaction occurred on Sunday during the Los Angeles Lakers' away game against the Philadelphia Sixers at the Wells Fargo Centre. As James stood near the premium seats, a person saw his chance and said,Clearly not ready for LBJ's response:""You still ain't got no hair though.”James, the first active NBA player to surpass a net worth of $1 billion, locked eyes with the man and shrugged, and said:""It happens. You know what I do got though! Got plenty of it!""The fans laughed their asses off as LeBron walked back up the floor with a smile on his face.LeBron James certainly doesn't have it every night as he approaches the age of 41. But he is still capable of bringing it. The Philadelphia 76ers learnt the hard way Sunday night.Two games after breaking a 1,297-game streak of double-digit scoring, James led the Lakers to a 112-108 road victory by scoring 10 consecutive points in the fourth quarter.His first bucket of the run increased the Lakers' advantage to 102-98. With the game tied at 105 with 1:11 remaining, James grabbed a pass from Luka Doncic and pulled up from three, retaking the lead for the Lakers.On the next Los Angeles possession, with the Lakers leading by three, James faced Quentin Grimes from the top of the key outside the 3-point line. He then drove to the left wing past the elbow, pulling up for a fadeaway jumper with Grimes' hand on his face.James not only clapped back at the heckler, but also hushed him by scoring 29 points in the Lakers' 112-108 victory over the 76ers. That wasn't James' only meeting with a fan throughout the game. He also made a young fan's wish come true by signing his Lakers jersey thereafter.James also single-handedly led the Lakers to victory on Sunday. When he returned to the game at 5:25 in the fourth quarter, the Lakers had a two-point lead, 98-96. He then made a 22-foot jumper at 4:25, a three at 3:43, and another three at 1:12 to put the 76ers away.The final nail in the coffin came at the 27.4 mark, when he drained a stepback shot from the left wing to give the Lakers a 110-105 advantage, effectively ending the game for the home club.Also read: Could Zion Williamson actually surpass LeBron James, like an ex-teammate suggests?","LeBron James had a funny conversation with a heckler who made a remark about his hairline during the Los Angeles Lakers' game against the Philadelphia 76ers on Sunday.

Fans connect the dots: Celina Powell claims ticket-buying, could it involve suspended Heat star Terry Rozier?



Social media is buzzing after Celina Powell claimed a Miami Heat player has been buying her courtside tickets. She didn’t reveal the player’s name, but fans quickly connected the dots especially since Terry Rozier is currently the only Heat player on suspension. The combination of Powell’s claim and Rozier’s suspension has sparked wild speculation and nonstop chatter from #HeatNation.Celina Powell, who is known for publicly sharing her relationships with celebrities and athletes, previously claimed to have had personal interactions with Terry Rozier. Powell made social media posts referencing Rozier, including comments about encounters linked to NBA games, though she never provided verified proof.Powell’s post didn’t name the player, but social media was quick to make assumptions. Since Rozier is the only Heat player on suspension, fans immediately started connecting the dots. While there’s no confirmed evidence that Rozier is involved, the overlap has fueled endless speculation and online chatter. The story highlights just how fast social media can turn a vague claim into a viral narrative, with users dissecting every possible clue, sharing theories, and even creating humorous memes to weigh in on the mystery.Recently, Rozier was placed on suspension by the Heat following a federal gambling investigation. According to official reports, the investigation involves allegations of wire fraud, money laundering conspiracy, and betting irregularities. These charges are separate from any claims circulating online, including Celina Powell’s social media posts. Rozier has pleaded not guilty to the charges and is cooperating with authorities as the legal process continues.Rozier’s suspension marks a significant pause in his career, leaving fans and analysts watching closely to see how this situation will unfold.

How The Heckler Took a Shot at LeBron James

LeBron James' Billionaire Mic-Drop Moment

Dominant Performance and a Heartwarming Finish

LeBron James delivered one of the most unforgettable sideline moments of the 2025-26 NBA season during the Los Angeles Lakers’ road win over the Philadelphia 76ers on December 7, 2025. What started as a routine timeout at Wells Fargo Center instantly turned into viral gold when a courtside heckler tried mocking LeBron’s hairline. Instead of ignoring it, the Lakers superstar fired back with a billionaire-level clapback that had the entire arena erupting.This latest incident adds to the long history of fans attempting to get into LeBron James’ head, whether through cheap insults or provocative taunts. Yet time and again, the four-time MVP proves that he not only thrives under pressure but also has a sense of humor sharp enough to silence critics in seconds. This exchange quickly became another addition to LeBron’s growing collection of iconic courtside moments.During a timeout, a fan seated courtside, a spot that costs thousands, decided to take a personal jab at LeBron James, yelling, “You still ain’t got no hair though!” The remark echoed some of the trash talk LeBron has faced for years, from debates about his hairline to heated run-ins like the infamous “Courtside Karen” moment.But on this particular night in Philadelphia, the fan picked the wrong target at the wrong time.LeBron, completely unmoved, glanced over, shrugged, and then delivered a perfectly timed response: “It happens. You know what I do got though! Got plenty of it!” His delivery alone was enough to send the crowd into laughter, turning the heckler’s attempted insult into instant meme material.Everyone in the arena understood exactly what LeBron James was referencing with “plenty of it.” As the NBA’s first active billionaire, James subtly reminded the heckler, and anyone watching, that even if the hairline jokes continue, his bank account remains untouched. The moment captured LeBron’s confidence and charisma, showcasing the kind of quick-witted clapback that fans will be quoting for years.The heckler was left stunned, the crowd was buzzing, and LeBron walked back onto the court with a smile that looked like he had just iced the game. It was the perfect mix of humor and swagger, just LeBron being LeBron.Despite the courtside drama, LeBron stayed locked in, dropping 29 points and leading the Lakers to a gritty 112-108 victory over the Sixers. After the final buzzer, he made time for a young fan, signing a Lakers jersey and giving the crowd another reason to cheer. The combination of on-court excellence, sharp banter, and genuine fan interaction underscored why LeBron has remained one of the most compelling figures in basketball.Also read: Chauncey Billups Offloads $4.275M Oregon Estate Amid Federal Gambling Probe From shutting down hecklers to uplifting young fans, LeBron’s presence remains larger than life, on and off the court.",LeBron James delivered one of the most unforgettable sideline moments of the 2025-26 NBA season during the Los Angeles Lakers’ road win over the Philadelphia 76ers.

Federal Probe Exposes High-Stakes Poker Scheme

Chauncey Billups Legal Fallout and Court Proceedings

Chauncey Billups Oregon Mansion Sold as Questions Mount

Chauncey Billups’ life off the court has taken a dramatic turn as the Portland Trail Blazers coach, long regarded as one of the NBA’s most respected figures, faces an escalating legal crisis tied to a mafia-linked illegal gambling operation. The story has gripped the league, stunned fans, and raised serious questions about Billups’ future both in Portland and in professional basketball.Amid the mounting scrutiny, Billups has made a major personal move: the sudden sale of his multimillion-dollar Oregon home. The timing of the transaction, finalized while federal charges advance, has only intensified speculation that financial and legal pressures may be reshaping his lifestyle behind the scenes.The scandal traces back to a sweeping federal investigation that uncovered a sophisticated, rigged poker network operating across major U.S. cities including Manhattan, Las Vegas, Miami, and the Hamptons. Billups is accused of participating as a celebrity draw, enticing wealthy players, referred to as “fish”, into games designed to deceive participants through altered shuffling machines, concealed cameras, X-ray table setups, and marked cards.Authorities estimate that victims were defrauded out of roughly $7 million beginning in 2019.The illegal enterprise allegedly involved members of the Gambino, Genovese, and Bonanno crime families, who enforced debt collection through intimidation, threats, and physical assaults. Investigators say Billups received payouts for his role, including a notable $50,000 wire transfer following a game in 2020. The probe also snared other basketball figures such as former NBA player Damon “DJ” Jones and Miami Heat guard Terry Rozier, who were pulled into overlapping gambling and insider-betting activities focused on injuries.Chauncey Billups’ arrest in Portland in late October 2025 triggered his immediate placement on unpaid and indefinite leave by the Trail Blazers. Officials emphasized that the allegations are unrelated to his coaching responsibilities, but the fallout has nonetheless disrupted the franchise. Billups entered a not-guilty plea in federal court on November 24, 2025, and was released on a $5 million bond backed by family properties in Colorado. He is barred from all gambling activity as part of his release terms, with his next court hearing scheduled for March 4, 2026.Just as the scandal intensified, Chauncey Billups moved to offload his 7,366-square-foot Lake Oswego estate, a property he purchased in July 2021 for $3.9 million through his LLC, “Phavored.” Complete with luxurious amenities including a lagoon-style pool and a multi-level spa waterfall, the home initially listed in the $3-4 million range but ultimately secured a sale price of $4.275 million. The profitable sale has triggered debate over whether he is securing legal funds, preparing for a potential move back to his Denver roots, or simply capitalizing on market conditions.Also read: ""By an AI snow bunny?"" - Gilbert Arenas roasts Matt Barnes over $61k AI extortion fiasco With the Trail Blazers sitting at 9–15 under interim coach Tiago Splitter and clinging to early playoff hopes, Billups’ uncertain future looms over the organization.

Giannis Antetokounmpo leaving Milwaukee Bucks soon? Inside mysterious future fueling bold NBA trade whispers,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nba/top-stories/giannis-antetokounmpo-leaving-milwaukee-bucks-soon-inside-mysterious-future-fueling-bold-nba-trade-whispers/articleshow/125845549.cms,"Giannis Antetokounmpo is now facing trading issues (Image via AP)

Why Giannis Antetokounmpo’s uncertain future continues to ignite NBA-wide trade whispers?

Heat, Warriors and others face major hurdles in Giannis pursuit

Teams are keeping a close eye on the Milwaukee Bucks and their allegedly unhappy superstar, Giannis Antetokounmpo . According to a recent report from Jake Fischer, there may be a forming landscape surrounding Antetokounmpo, his preferred new team in the recent York Knicks, and the Knicks' main challenger in a potential trade for the Bucks forward.Fischer verified what league management had long suspected. Giannis Antetokounmpo considers the New York Knicks his favored destination if he ever asks for a trade from Milwaukee. However, the Bucks have continued to remind the public that Giannis is supposedly unavailable.According to Fischer, that would be another Eastern Conference team, the Miami Heat. That being said, Fischer reported that front offices anticipate an unusual hunt for any team preparing future proposals, as everyone believes Antetokounmpo will have a significant influence on his next team.However, Marc Stein said that the Bucks are supposedly unwilling to part ways with their star player. As the trade deadline for the 2025-26 season approaches, the Milwaukee Bucks continue to claim that Giannis Antetokounmpo is not available, sources confirm.As per Stein’s X post:“As trade season draws close, everyone is talking about Giannis. Even though — and I want to underline this — the Bucks continue to tell teams: 'He’s not available. We don’t want your trade pitches…”He continued:“So, it’s this weird deal where the Bucks keep shouting into the wind: 'Listen to us! We don’t want to talk trades with you about Giannis Antetokounmpo!' And the rest of the league just ignores it and obsesses about him.""Stein observes that, despite the Bucks' repeated denials, the other 29 franchises continue to act as if a deal is possible. Teams are preparing for a time when Milwaukee may consider offers, but Stein emphasises, ""To this point — the Bucks continue to say: 'We are not trading this guy.'""Furthermore, not only Stein but also ESPN's Brian Windhorst made the same claim once.In a recent interview, Windhorst stated that Antetokounmpo requested a trade to the New York Knicks during the most recent offseason. However, Windhorst informed listeners that Giannis had not been moved and that the team had no plans to move him.Antetokounmpo is committed with Milwaukee until the 2027-28 season, but Windhorst believes he might be traded before the start of next season. Doc Rivers, Bucks coach, stated Wednesday that Antetokounmpo has not demanded a trade.Meanwhile, other teams, notably the Miami Heat, seem unlikely suitors unless big personnel changes occur. Stein emphasises that Miami would have to part with guys like Andrew Wiggins in a true trade, while sources say the Heat cannot seriously compete for Giannis without significant assets.Antetokounmpo, who turned 31 over the weekend, averages 28.9 points, 10.1 rebounds, and 6.1 assists while shooting 43.5 percent from three. He is still available for an extension in 2026, according to Fischer, and several franchises are keeping a careful eye on the issue.Antetokounmpo's player option for the 2027-28 season increases his influence over potential destinations. According to league executives, any team interested in acquiring him would require promises of re-signing, guaranteeing both competitive potential and market appeal are met.Also read:","Milwaukee Bucks forward Giannis Antetokounmpo is reportedly unhappy with his contract.

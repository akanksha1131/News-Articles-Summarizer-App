NEW DELHI: South Africa captain Aiden Markram admitted that his team was outplayed by India’s disciplined bowling in challenging, cold conditions during their seven-wicket defeat in the third T20I at the HPCA Stadium, where the visitors were dismissed for 117.India’s bowlers shared the spoils, with Arshdeep Singh , Harshit Rana, Varun Chakravarthy and Kuldeep Yadav claiming two wickets each, while Hardik Pandya and Shivam Dube picked up one apiece. South Africa slumped to 30/4 inside the first seven overs and were unable to recover. In response, India chased down the target with 25 balls remaining to take a 2-1 lead in the five-match series.“It’s hard to say. Tough conditions up front. They got the ball in the right areas and before you know it, you’re four, five, six down. So, got to give credit to their bowling. Few of them bowled a Test-match delivery, Test-match length, it was challenging. So if conditions are the same moving forward, you’re just going to have to find ways to get through that and try to put some pressure back on them.”Reflecting further at the post-match presentation, Markram added, “You’ve just got to give credit to that bowling unit on the night. It was tough. You want to play in this format, but they didn’t give us much to score off.Tried to just take it deep. We obviously lost a couple of wickets, so you think to try to take it deep and make a play at the end.”Top-scoring with 61, Markram felt a total of 140 to 150 would have put South Africa firmly in the contest. “The whole time I was thinking maybe 140, 150 - I think we were massively in the game.”“So again, if I come off at the death there, I feel like I should be hitting that ball for six, then it could be a different game. So it is small margins. We’re not going to look too deeply into it. We’ll have to have a few answers if conditions are the same. That’s the case.”Markram also highlighted the importance of identifying the right match-ups and being positive when opportunities arise. “In conditions like these, it’s probably picking a bowler on the night that you feel like you can target. I don’t think it’s a wicket where you can just get away with trying to hit everyone.”“So it’s finding that match-up, and when the match-up comes, completely backing yourself. In between there, try to be efficient, try to keep the scoreboard ticking. I think you get to that score of 140, 150.”He stressed that players should continue to express themselves despite the difficult outing. “You never want to curb players, you never want to speak any negative language about keeping the ball on the floor or whatever the case might be. You always want to encourage the boys to play. Each person will take lessons from tonight and be better cricketers afterwards.”Markram signed off by acknowledging that South Africa could have done a few things better with the ball as well. “Obviously the start. They were always going to play that way - so credit to him (Abhishek), he came off. But we’re always going to gauge it on the amount of balls we landed in the right area.”“Possibly in those first three or four overs, not quite enough in the right area. And if we get them in the right area and they go for 60, then so be it. That’s probably the bit we’ll gauge.”“But after that, I thought they were much better. So another positive, extending the game as much as they did by holding length. Holding length pretty well and consistently, and yeah, asking some good questions.”","South Africa captain Aiden Markram admits his team was outplayed by India’s disciplined bowling in challenging, cold conditions.

Lionel Messi India trip: Mumbai out in numbers for the superstar

What makes you technically so strong and the fastest in today's era?

People talk about your speed, not as much about your ‘race IQ'. Do you make decisions mid-race?

With such fine margins between success and defeat, how do you handle pressure?

You've spoken about going after Bolt's times. Which feels more realistic now — 100m or 200m?

PUNE: Noah Lyles is all about fractions of a second. The finest of margins define his sport, and the man himself — the fastest in the world at the moment. In the city as brand ambassador for the Bajaj Pune Marathon, one glimpse of the Paris Olympic 100m champion is enough to feel the energy he carries within. In an extensive chat with TOI, the American sprinter tells us he never liked to go to school or college. But when he breaks down his races, he appears nothing short of a mathematician.Excerpts:I'm pretty excited to be here. I have a very big Indian following on social media, and for about two years I kept telling my agent, “I've got to make it out”. This is the first time we've had the time, or forced time to finally come here.From early on, I was always a student of what I do, how I run, what makes great athletes, what makes champions. I'm extremely ambitious. It's also about training smarter, not harder. A lot of people think if they just give all their effort, they'll get better. That's true to a degree, but it's much more efficient to know why you're training.I learned why I need certain foods, which foods my body works best with, what kind of massages work best, when I need a chiropractor.These little details are what make me dangerous. I'm always looking for the weakest chink in the armour so I can patch it up, make it stronger. As that gets stronger, I get stronger.Oh yeah, absolutely, especially in the 200 metres. The 100m is different. In the 100, it's about execution, and you might get one chance to adjust. In the 200m, you can make two or three adjustments. The most common one is how I come off the turn. I watch how much energy people use in the first 100 metres if they try to run away from me. Often, they don't have enough left for the second half. I also analyse whether they transfer energy from the first 100 to the second.Very few athletes do that well — (Usain) Bolt, Justin (Gatlin), Johan (Blake), Tyson (Gay). I've seen a little of it in one up-and-coming athlete, but I won't name him. I don't want to put pressure on him. I want him to find his own path.There is pressure, for sure, but I try not to make a big deal out of it. I'm doing what I love. How many people can say they run for nine seconds and the whole world goes crazy? That's a blessing.I don't see pressure, I see opportunity. If it's hard or challenging, good. I don't want it to be easy. If I wanted easy, I'd get a factory job pushing a button every day, but I'd be bored. I want challenges, I want goals. I want to shoot for the stars.The 200m is the closest in sight. Running 19.31 secs and being the third-fastest human makes it easier to see the light at the end of the tunnel. But I don't see a reason not to keep pushing in both.","Noah Lyles is the fastest man in the world at the moment. He is currently in Pune as brand ambassador for the Bajaj Pune Marathon.

Why the cricket maidaans of Mumbai are dying | Bombay Sport Exchange with Nadim Memon

NEW DELHI: England are staring at a daunting task and “need a miracle” heading into Wednesday’s third Ashes Test in Adelaide, with Australia boosted by the return of Pat Cummins as they eye sealing the series. Back-to-back eight-wicket defeats in Perth and Brisbane mean England have now gone 17 Tests without a win in Australia since their last series triumph there in 2010-11.Adding to the grim outlook, a victory for the hosts would wrap up the five-match series inside three Tests for the fourth straight Ashes contest played in Australia.Former England opener Geoffrey Boycott, who toured Australia four times and was part of two Ashes-winning sides, has been scathing in his assessment, pointing to “irresponsible batting, bowling too short, too wide or too full and catches dropped”.“Somehow, after just six days of Ashes cricket, England need a miracle,” he wrote in his column.Despite the pressure, coach Brendon McCullum remains defiant. “We’re a massive chance in this Test match. We do that, and the narrative changes in the series,” he said on Sunday.Captain Ben Stokes, meanwhile, was critical of his team’s inability to handle key moments after the Brisbane defeat and urged his players to show greater resilience.Former skipper Alastair Cook believes Stokes will not hold back ahead of the must-win day-night clash at the Adelaide Oval. “Ben Stokes is the most competitive person I’ve ever come across,” Cook told TNT Sports.“He won’t want to lose a game of tiddlywinks or table tennis, and he’s seeing his side failing under pressure.“I think for the first time in his captaining career, some home truths are going to be said to players.”History is firmly against England, with only one team ever overturning a 2-0 deficit to win the Ashes — Don Bradman’s Australia in 1936-37.Selection changes could be on the cards, with Mark Wood injured and Josh Tongue a possible replacement for Gus Atkinson. McCullum confirmed the top seven would remain unchanged, with Ollie Pope retaining his place at number three. Spin is expected to play a role, with Shoaib Bashir and Will Jacks vying for a spot.Australia, meanwhile, will welcome back Cummins to lead an attack already spearheaded by Mitchell Starc, who has taken 18 wickets. Nathan Lyon is also likely to return, while questions remain over Usman Khawaja’s role at the top of the order.Despite Australia’s dominance, Glenn McGrath urged caution. “They have England by the throat and must not let up just because some big names are returning. They cannot get complacent,” he wrote.Former captain Tim Paine added that Adelaide’s conditions could suit England’s aggressive style. “If there’s any wicket and ground in the country that suits them more than this, I don’t think there is one – so this will be a fascinating Test match,” he said.",England face Australia in the third Ashes Test in Adelaide on Wednesday. The hosts lead the five-match series 2-0 after wins in Perth and Brisbane. England have gone 17 Tests without a win in Australia since their last series triumph there in 2010-11.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125969588,imgsize-77656,width-400,resizemode-4/england-team-1512-getty.jpg"

It disincentivises players from working on parts of the game that they're not strong at. It means you can be a terrible fielder and it doesn't matter. So, I think overall, it's a crap rule. Jimmy Neesham on Impact Player rule

NEW DELHI: Since the introduction of the “Impact Player” rule in the Indian Premier League (IPL) in 2023, it has received mixed reactions. Former India head coach Rahul Dravid and captains Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli see it as disrupting the game’s balance and harming the development of all-rounders. Legends like Ricky Ponting and Jonty Rhodes have also raised concerns.In the ongoing ILT20, New Zealand and Dubai Capitals all-rounder Jimmy Neesham has joined the bandwagon by making a scathing remark on the rule, calling it “stupid,” and wished for it to be removed from T20 leagues to give players time to prepare. The all-rounder admitted he was caught off-guard when the opportunity to feature in the contest against Gulf Giants presented itself earlier this season. The reason for that, he believes, is in the Impact Player rule which doesn't help a player in being ready in advance.""It's a stupid rule. It doesn't work in the IPL. I don't know why we still have it, to be honest. It stops players from being able to prepare properly for the game. You obviously can't ever get a proper training day before the game if you think you're not playing because there's a chance that you could have to be roped into the XI at the last minute.So, you can't really develop your game,"" Neesham told TimesofIndia.com in an interaction organised by the Dubai Capitals.""It disincentivises players from working on parts of the game that they're not strong at. It means you can be a terrible fielder and it doesn't matter. So, I think overall, it's a crap rule. Hopefully, it's gone soon.""Example, if you're a young cricketer coming through, why would you work on your fielding? Because if you're a crap fielder, you just don't field. You just go off the field. It's stupid,"" he continued.The latest outing in the ILT20 took Neesham's tally of playing in sanctioned T20 leagues to 10. On the whole, he's represented over 30 teams in his career. Having declined a central contract with New Zealand Cricket in September 2022, Neesham has become a ""T20 freelancer.""Since September 2022, he's played for 10 teams in seven leagues, including most recently in Nepal, as well as 45 T20Is for New Zealand. The focus now is on the ILT20, five T20Is against India in January followed by the T20I World Cup in February-March.""Well, I'm 35 now, so sort of getting towards the back end of my career. We've got a T20 World Cup coming up in February, which is potentially going to be my last international assignment. And then from then on, it's just about managing the schedule, managing my body, trying to eke out as many games as possible towards the back end and try and contribute to as many teams as possible,"" said the Kiwi who is inching towards 100 T20Is, a list that includes only five of his compatriots.""Nepal was great. It's obviously great to see a young cricket nation sort of developing and creating its own T20 league. And then also we're going to have our own franchise T20 competition in New Zealand from next season as well. So there's still plenty on the diet for the next few years. And I'm excited to sort of see how it all ends up,"" he continued.Neesham stressed that ""no one is forcing anyone to play"" amid suggestions that the life of a T20 freelancer could lead to burnout. He made clear that this is the period to push with T20 World Cup on the horizon before getting the chance to put the feet up during the New Zealand off-season.Away from the field, Neesham is one of the few athletes who are known to give it back to the numerous social media trolls. With vitriol aplenty, Neesham's sarcastic responses have shut down anonymous provocateurs.""It's a shame that people behave the way they do on social media. I think it's a powerful tool for athletes to connect with fans and share another side of themselves. And I think it's always a pity when you see the abuse and the trolling and all that kind of things that happen on social media as sort of just the nature of how the world works currently. But you've got to have a thick skin and be able to shrug those things off,"" he clarified while acknowledging that he does block plenty of people for their harsh comments.","Jimmy Neesham has played in 10 T20 leagues since September 2022.

DHARAMSHALA: It’s a rarity in T20 cricket to see bowlers swinging the ball more than batters swinging their bats. It’s almost against the core marketing ethos of the format to see the ball dominating the bat, even as bowlers are fast being reduced to mere punching bags.Under lights, in frosty conditions in the hills on Sunday evening, Arshdeep Singh and Harshit Rana found perfect conditions to blow away South Africa’s top order after India captain Suryakumar Yadav elected to bowl, as the hosts went 2-1 up in the T20I series.The historically high-scoring venue witnessed a lopsided contest for much of the first innings as South Africa could only muster 117, thanks largely to Aiden Markram ’s 61 off 46 in a masterful display of batting.The score was too low to put the Indian batters under pressure, more so with South Africa’s new-ball bowlers spraying it around. Abhishek Sharma’s characteristic hard-hitting 18-ball 35 at the top of the chase eased things for Shubman Gill, who laboured to 28 off 28 balls after surviving multiple close calls.India eased past the target in 15.5 overs with seven wickets to spare, as Tilak Varma returned to the dressing room unbeaten on 26 off 34, alongside Shivam Dube, after an unconvincing Suryakumar was dismissed for 12 off 11 balls.India’s chase looked comfortable mainly due to Arshdeep and Rana literally bullying the South African batters with the hooping ball to reduce the visitors to 25/3 at the end of the powerplay.Coming into the game on the back of a horrific outing in the previous match in Chandigarh, Arshdeep wouldn’t have complained about seeing the ball jag around prodigiously both ways up front. Arshdeep and Rana dismissed openers Reeza Hendricks and Quinton de Kock lbw respectively in the first two overs before Rana knocked over Dewald Brevis in the fourth. Only Markram, displaying high-class technique, stood firmly in front of the moving ball.The conditions were so heavily in favour of seam that every seamer, including Hardik Pandya and Shivam Dube, picked up a wicket in their first over. Except for Brevis’s wild cover drive off Rana’s inswinger, all top-order batters fell to defensive shots.Not only did the opening burst with the new ball make up for Jasprit Bumrah’s sudden withdrawal, but it also offered respite to Indian batters who have been found wanting against the new ball too often.It also set the stage for the ever-menacing Varun Chakravarthy, who rushed through his four overs to return figures of 2/11, marginally better than wrecker-in-chief Arshdeep’s 2/13. It mattered little that India were ordinary in the field, dropping three regulation catches.The broad blade of Markram’s vertical bat against top-notch swing bowling made for absorbing viewing. Markram was the only batter to find the middle regularly. He capitalised on Rana’s inexperience in the final over of the powerplay, when the pacer inexplicably tried variations instead of sticking to seam and swing. Markram punished Rana again later, picking up 19 runs in the 18th over. Rana finished with figures of 2/34.Unlike Test cricket , the team batting first doesn’t have the luxury of time to see off the new ball and wait for conditions to ease.While Markram relied on his straight bat to hit six fours and two sixes, Donovan Ferreira got carried away with a couple of lusty blows before losing his stumps attempting a wild slog off Varun Chakravarthy. Ferreira’s 20 off 15 helped add 35 runs in 20 balls with Markram and briefly threatened to post a challenging total.",Arshdeep Singh and Harshit Rana took two wickets each for India. Aiden Markram top scored for South Africa with 61 off 46 balls. India eased past the target in 15.5 overs with seven wickets to spare. Abhishek Sharma’s characteristic hard- hitting 18-ball 35 eased things.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125963843,imgsize-229988,width-400,resizemode-4/ind-vs-sa-3rd-t20i-match.jpg"

Sharjah Warriorz produced a well-rounded performance to secure their first win of the DP World ILT20 Season 4, edging past MI Emirates by six runs at the Zayed Cricket Stadium on Sunday. The victory was built on a strong batting effort from Johnson Charles and a disciplined bowling display from the Warriorz attack.Charles set the tone with a composed 77 off 53 balls, including seven fours and four sixes, as the Warriorz posted 174 for 3. Tom Kohler-Cadmore supported with 30 runs, while stand-in skipper Sikander Raza contributed 29 off 22. The pair put together a solid platform, helping the team recover after a cautious powerplay start. Charles brought up his half-century off Rashid Khan in the tenth over, and Kohler-Cadmore rotated strike effectively to keep the momentum. In the death overs, Raza and James Rew added crucial runs to take the total to a competitive 175.MI Emirates started well, with Jonny Bairstow (31 off 23) and Muhammad Waseem (44 off 29) putting on a brisk 54-run opening stand inside six overs. Waseem struck a six off Taskin Ahmed and both batters found regular boundaries off Maheesh Theekshana. However, the middle overs proved costly as Sikander Raza and Junaid Siddique struck key blows. Raza removed Bairstow and Waseem, while Siddique accounted for Kieron Pollard and Romario Shepherd in quick succession, leaving MI Emirates struggling.Needing 25 runs off the final over, Nicholas Pooran threatened to snatch victory with three sixes, but Siddique held his nerve, conceding only 18 runs. MI Emirates finished on 168 for 5, falling short by six runs.MI Emirates skipper Kieron Pollard praised his side’s fightback but acknowledged the team had lost momentum in the middle overs. Sikander Raza said the team remained confident throughout, adapting to a slow surface and ensuring they crossed the line in a crunch game.Sharjah Warriorz 174/3 (Johnson Charles 77, Tom Kohler-Cadmore 30, Sikander Raza 29; Rashid Khan 1 for 22)MI Emirates 168/5 (Nicholas Pooran 48 not out, Muhammad Waseem 44, Jonny Bairstow 31; Sikander Raza 2 for 15, Junaid Siddique 2 for 35)Player of the match: Sikander Raza","Sharjah Warriorz secure first win of DP World ILT20 Season 4.

Areas to work on



Do MI need to go to an auction at all?



The five-time champions and one of the league's most ruthless teams, the Mumbai Indians (MI) have almost all their boxes ticked on paper heading into the IPL Auction 2026 on December 16 in Abu DhabiMumbai Indians, tied with Chennai Super Kings (CSK) as the most successful IPL team, were eliminated in Qualifier 2 last season (2025) by Punjab Kings (PBKS), thanks to a batting masterclass by Shreyas Iyer.Mumbai Indians came late to the party last season, as they so often do, after losing four of their first five games partly due to not having Jasprit Bumrah at the start of the season. Once Bumrah came back, MI took off and won six games on the trot and qualified for the playoffs.MI had a win percentage of 56.2 in the 2025 season, much better than the 28.6 they had in the previous one (2024), when they finished last in the points table.Before the auction, MI released Arjun Tendulkar (traded to LSG), Bevon Jacobs, Karn Sharma, Lizaad Williams, Mujeeb Ur Rahman, Reece Topley, Krishnan Shrijith, Satyanarayana Raju, and Vignesh Puthur.However, they have got Shardul Thakur (traded in from LSG), Sherfane Rutherford (traded in from GT), and Mayank Markande (traded in from KKR), to add depth in an already formidable squad.Ahead of the IPL Auction, here's a look at the strong points of MI, areas they need to work on, and what to expect from them in Abu Dhabi.If anyone just writes the names of Rohit Sharma, Jasprit Bumrah, Hardik Pandya , Suryakumar Yadav, Tilak Varma, Trent Boult, Mitchell Santner, Ryan Rickelton, Will Jacks, among others, and tells that they all play for the same team in T20s, then perhaps there's no need to write anything else about the strong points of that team. The names and their numbers tell the story on their own.In Jasprit Bumrah, MI have arguably the world's best T20 bowler; he has 183 wickets at an economy of 7.24 in IPL. In the 2025 season, Bumrah (18) and Boult (22) had among them 40 wickets and conceded runs at just 6.68 and 8.97, respectively. Continuing their trend of unearthing domestic talent, MI introduced left-arm pacer Ashwani Kumar last year, he took 11 wickets in 7 matches last season, and along with Deepak Chahar, Bumrah, and Boult, he played a key role in MI's success with the ball.With 717 runs at a strike rate of 167.92 and a ridiculous average of 65.18, Suryakumar Yadav had a dream season in 2025 and was the top scorer for MI.In Ryan Rickelton and Rohit Sharma, MI have an opening pair that may not be the most destructive, but surely one that can demolish any bowling lineup. Rohit, 418 runs at a strike rate of 149.29, and Rickelton, 388 runs at a strike rate of 150.97, were the second and third among the top scorers for MI last season.And in their captain Hardik Pandya, MI have the best T20 fast-bowling all-rounder. In the 2025 season, he scored 224 runs at a strike rate of 163.50 and was the third-highest wicket-taker for MI with 14 wickets. But perhaps most important for MI was his return as a finisher. Pandya scored only 58 runs in 44 balls at a below-par strike rate of 131.8 between overs 15-20 in the 2024 season. On the other hand, in 2025, the all-rounder scored 182 runs in 109 balls at a strike rate of 167.0Naman Dhir was also a key player in providing MI with good finishes in the 2025 season. He hit 201 runs at 187.9 in the overs between 15-20 last season.Santner and Karn Sharma's spin provided control to MI in the middle overs last season. In 13 matches, Santner took 10 wickets and gave away runs at only 7.92 runs per over. Karn played only 5 matches and was economical at 8.53 while also taking 7 wickets.While MI released Puthur and Karn before the auction, they have traded in leg-spinner Mayank Markande from KKR. Markande earlier played for MI in the 2018,’19, and 2022 seasons. MI will also have the services of Afghan off-spinner Allah Ghazanfar. MI bought him last season, but he was replaced by Mujeeb ur Rahman after being ruled out for the whole season due to injury.Not necessarily a weakness, but MI might be slightly concerned about Tilak Varma's strike rate. Among the top 5 run getters for MI last season, Tilak had the slowest scoring rate of 138.31. He hit 343 runs off 248 balls in 13 innings. To put things in perspective, he scored at a strike rate of 164.1 and 149.6 in the 2023 and 2024 seasons, respectively.Will Jacks also had a below-par strike rate of 135.47 last season. However, as a possible backup for him, MI traded in Sherfane Rutherford from GT, who struck at 157.29 last season.While MI have almost all its boxes ticked, there are some holes, though very small, to fill.With only Rs 2.75 crore in their purse and 5 remaining slots, one of them overseas, MI may want to have an Indian middle-order batter as a backup option in the auction. Someone like Sarfaraz Khan might be on their list, but expect their scout team to again unearth someone from the domestic circuit whose name many may not have heard before.What MI would also like to have are some more Indian spin-bowling options. In Raghu Sharma and Mayank Markande, MI have two Indian leg-spinners, they might go for one or two Indian finger spin options at the auction.However, whether MI get the desired players or not, the auction is unlikely to decide their upcoming season. Hardik Pandya's side looks formidable enough to take on any team to end their title drought and win the IPL silverware for a record sixth time.",Mumbai Indians (MI) have almost all their boxes ticked on paper heading into the IPL Auction 2026 on December 16 in Abu Dhabi.

Cricket icon Sachin Tendulkar described Lionel Messi ’s visit to Mumbai as a “golden moment” for both the city and the country, as the Argentine football superstar continued his India tour on Sunday. Tendulkar drew a parallel between Messi’s presence at the venue and India’s 2011 Cricket World Cup triumph, a historic moment that unfolded at the same ground.Addressing the gathering, Tendulkar recalled the memories associated with Mumbai, calling it a city where countless dreams have reached their destination. He referenced India’s ODI World Cup victory in 2011 and acknowledged the role of fans in making those moments possible. Tendulkar said the arrival of Messi, along with Inter Miami teammates Luis Suarez and Rodrigo de Paul, added another special chapter to the venue’s history and praised the warm reception given to the footballers by the city.Speaking about Messi, Tendulkar said there was little left to say about a player who has achieved everything the sport can offer. He highlighted Messi’s dedication, determination and commitment, while also stressing the humility he brings as a person. Tendulkar extended his best wishes to Messi and his family on behalf of Indians and thanked him for inspiring young athletes. He also expressed hope that Indian football would one day reach the heights it aspires to.During the interaction, Tendulkar presented Messi with a No.10 jersey signed by him, while the World Cup-winning Argentine captain returned the gesture by gifting a football.Messi arrived in Mumbai around noon amid World Cup-level security arrangements, marking the second day of his four-city “GOAT India Tour 2025”. He is scheduled to conclude the tour on Monday in New Delhi, where he will meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi The Mumbai event followed a mixed start to the tour. While the Kolkata leg on Saturday was marred by crowd management issues and security lapses, the evening programme in Hyderabad ran smoothly and ended on a positive note.","Sachin Tendulkar described Lionel Messi’s visit to Mumbai as a ‘golden moment’ for both the city and the country.

India skipper Suryakumar Yadav won the toss and chose to bowl first in the third T20I against South Africa on Sunday, with conditions and dew playing a key role in the decision at the HPCA Stadium in Dharamsala.India were forced into two changes. Jasprit Bumrah missed the match due to personal reasons, while Axar Patel was ruled out after falling unwell. Harshit Rana was drafted in to bolster the pace attack, and Kuldeep Yadav returned to the XI to strengthen the spin department. With the five match series locked at 1-1, India opted to chase under lights, anticipating heavier dew later in the evening.South Africa also made notable changes, bringing back Corbin Bosch, Tristan Stubbs and Anrich Nortje. David Miller, George Linde and Lutho Sipamla were left out as the visitors looked to back the momentum gained from their convincing win in the second T20I.Speaking at the toss, South Africa captain Aiden Markram highlighted the cold conditions, calling them very different from what his side experiences in Johannesburg. He said the surface looked good and could improve as the game progressed. Markram stressed the importance of consistency after their strong comeback in the previous match and said the team was keen to assess the first few overs before building a competitive total.Suryakumar Yadav said India were happy to bowl first, pointing to the quality of the pitch and the presence of early dew. He described Dharamsala as a wonderful venue and emphasised the need for intensity across all three hours of play. The India captain said the team’s focus was on responding positively after the last game and playing fearless cricket.(Playing XI): Reeza Hendricks, Quinton de Kock(w), Aiden Markram(c), Dewald Brevis, Tristan Stubbs, Donovan Ferreira, Marco Jansen, Corbin Bosch, Anrich Nortje, Lungi Ngidi, Ottneil Baartman(Playing XI): Abhishek Sharma, Shubman Gill, Suryakumar Yadav(c), Tilak Varma, Hardik Pandya, Shivam Dube, Jitesh Sharma(w), Harshit Rana, Arshdeep Singh , Kuldeep Yadav, Varun ChakaravarthyWith both sides making changes and conditions adding another layer of intrigue, the third T20I promised a crucial contest in the context of the closely fought series.","India skipper Suryakumar Yadav won the toss and chose to bowl first in the third T20I against South Africa.

Ashish Nehra interview: Gujarat Titans head coach backs out of form Shubman Gill

Former India batter Sanjay Bangar has underlined the importance of clearly defining Shubman Gill ’s role at the top of the order, urging the opener to concentrate on sound cricketing shots rather than chasing big hits. Bangar believes Gill’s value lies in providing stability, especially with explosive batters like Hardik Pandya , Jitesh Sharma and Shivam Dube waiting in the middle and lower order.Speaking on JioStar, Bangar said Gill should be entrusted with seeing off the new ball, managing difficult overs and absorbing early pressure in tight or low-scoring contests. “I’d clarify his role: there’s no need for big shots. Stick to proper cricketing strokes when you have so many fast scorers behind you. Lay the platform, particularly in crunch situations or low-scoring games. India needs someone who can handle the new ball and survive early breakthroughs, like that first-ball dismissal,” Bangar said.The comments come after Gill endured a tough start to the ongoing five-match T20I series against South Africa. He managed only four runs in the opening match and was dismissed for a golden duck in the second, as the series stands level at 1-1 heading into Sunday’s third T20I in Dharamsala.Gill’s recent numbers have raised concerns. In his last 14 T20I innings, he has scored 263 runs at an average of 23.90 and a strike rate of 142.93, figures that fall short of expectations given his stature.India’s earlier dominance at the top following their T20 World Cup 2024 triumph and the start of 2025 was powered by the opening pair of Sanju Samson and Abhishek Sharma . The duo averaged 33.43 across 16 innings and scored at a striking rate of 193.84, setting up strong middle and death-over returns.A change in strategy saw Gill replace Samson at the top, with selectors viewing him as a future all-format captain. However, the Gill–Abhishek combination has yet to deliver on its promise. While their numbers on paper appear healthy, the partnership has not translated into consistent impact for India so far.","Former India batter Sanjay Bangar has underlined the importance of clearly defining Shubman Gill ’s role at the top of the order.

IPL mini auction: Lot of interest for Cam Green | Wait ends for Prithvi Shaw, Sarfaraz Khan?

Building batting depth

Bowling balance holds the key

Sunrisers Hyderabad head into the IPL Auction 2026 with a reputation they have earned the hard way. Over the last three seasons, no team has swung between extremes quite like them. Wooden spoon in 2023, runners-up in 2024, and then a slide to sixth in 2025. For a franchise built on fearless cricket, volatility has become both a strength and a recurring problem.The identity of this side was fully established in 2024. Travis Head and Abhishek Sharma turned the powerplay into a demolition zone, striking at 191.55 and 204.21 respectively, and changing how teams approached the first six overs. Few batting units have been as intimidating early in an innings.But 2025 exposed the risks behind that approach. Head, Abhishek and Kishan all crossed 350 runs with healthy averages and strike rates, yet the season swung wildly from game to game. In four matches, all three were dismissed for under 25 in the same innings, and SRH lost every one of those games. When the top order failed together, there was no recovery.That is why the auction focus is unlikely to be on fixing the top order, but on safeguarding it.SRH already have one of the best opening pairs in the league, and the hope will be that Kishan finds greater consistency at number three after a stop-start season. What they need is depth rather than disruption.Backups who can slot in seamlessly and maintain the same high-tempo style will be on the radar. Finn Allen, Tim Seifert or Kusal Perera fit SRH’s aggressive batting philosophy and also offer wicketkeeping cover. Among Indian options, Anmolpreet Singh or Mayank Agarwal offer experience and insurance.The middle order remains both the team’s backbone and its biggest worry. Heinrich Klaasen carried SRH through long stretches last season, finishing as their leading run-scorer with 487 runs at an average of 44.27 and a strike rate close to 173. Retained for INR 23 crore, he remains central to everything SRH plans. His recent form outside the IPL has dipped, but the franchise will hope familiar conditions bring the best out of him again, possibly at number four. Nitish Kumar Reddy struggled to settle at that position, while Aniket Verma showed promise as a finisher. R. Smaran’s prolific Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy run makes him one to watch, and he could force his way into the eleven sooner rather than later.What SRH clearly lack is a proven match-winner at number seven. Someone who can finish games under pressure. Venkatesh Iyer offers that flexibility, while Liam Livingstone feels tailor-made for Hyderabad with his power and part-time spin. David Miller is another name that makes sense. With Head, Klaasen and Pat Cummins locked in as overseas starters, SRH may need to be clever about how they balance their foreign slots, but Miller’s ability to close tight chases could solve a problem that hurt them badly in 2025.Bowling is where the biggest decisions lie. Releasing Mohammad Shami just a year after spending INR 10 crore was a bold call, but his powerplay struggles left SRH leaking runs early. The pace unit otherwise looks settled under Pat Cummins, though adding an Indian fast bowler for depth would make sense over a long season.Spin remains the most urgent concern for them. The letting go of Adam Zampa and Rahul Chahar has left SRH short of experience, especially with Zeeshan Ansari and Harsh Dubey still works in progress. An overseas option like Wanindu Hasaranga adds quality but complicates balance. That is why Ravi Bishnoi looms as the most important target at the auction. With 77 IPL matches and 72 wickets, he fits perfectly, and a bidding war in the 13 to 15 crore range would not be a surprise.Matt Henry is another option worth watching. With Shami gone, SRH lack a proven new-ball partner for Cummins, and Henry’s ability to swing the ball early could bring much-needed control to the powerplay.With INR 25.50 crore in their purse, the third-highest among all teams, Sunrisers Hyderabad have room to be bold again. History suggests they will be. Whether that boldness brings brilliance or heartbreak will depend on how well they balance their love for chaos with the need for stability. The thrill will remain. The challenge is making it sustainable.","Sunrisers Hyderabad have swung between extremes in the last three IPL seasons. Travis Head and Abhishek Sharma turned the powerplay into a demolition zone.

Former India cricketer Mohammad Kaif has raised concerns over Suryakumar Yadav ’s current form, suggesting it poses a bigger challenge for the Men in Blue than Shubman Gill ’s as the team gears up for the ICC T20 World Cup 2026.The 10th edition of the T20 World Cup is scheduled to begin on February 7, 2026, and conclude with the final on March 8. India and Sri Lanka will co-host the tournament, featuring 20 teams across eight venues—five in India and three in Sri Lanka—over a span of 29 days.Suryakumar Yadav has struggled in T20Is this year, scoring just 201 runs in 19 matches, with no fifties, an average of 14.35, and a strike rate of 126.41. Gill’s form has also dipped, though slightly better, with 263 runs in 14 matches, no fifties, an average of 23.90, and a strike rate of 142.93.Kaif pointed out that while India have multiple options at the top of the order, the captain’s poor form is a bigger worry since a designated captain cannot simply be replaced. He wrote on X: “With T20 World Cup round the corner, Surya's form is a bigger concern for India than Gill's. India has many opening options but a designated captain can't be replaced.”India and South Africa are currently level in their five-match T20I series after South Africa’s 51-run win in the second game on December 11.

Derby misery for Newcastle

Manchester City and Aston Villa ensured the Premier League title race remains finely balanced with convincing victories on Sunday, responding quickly after Arsenal moved five points clear at the summit a day earlier.Arsenal had strengthened its grip on top spot with a 2-1 win over Wolves on Saturday. That advantage was trimmed back within 24 hours as both City and Villa collected full points. City eased to a 3-0 win away at Crystal Palace, while Villa produced a dramatic comeback to defeat West Ham 3-2 at the London Stadium. City now sit two points behind Arsenal, with Villa a further point back in third.Manchester City gained a measure of payback for last season’s FA Cup final defeat to Crystal Palace with a dominant performance. Erling Haaland opened the scoring late in the first half, bringing up his 101st Premier League goal, before Phil Foden doubled the advantage. Haaland sealed the result from the penalty spot in the 89th minute to continue a prolific campaign that has already yielded 17 league goals.Aston Villa’s remarkable run continued as they claimed a ninth straight league victory, despite twice falling behind against West Ham.The hosts struck early through Mateus Fernandes, who netted after just 29 seconds, the fastest goal of the season so far. Villa drew level when Konstantinos Mavropanos turned the ball into his own net, but Jarrod Bowen restored West Ham’s lead before the break.Morgan Rogers took centre stage after halftime. He equalised five minutes into the second half and then completed the turnaround with a decisive strike in the 79th minute, underlining Villa’s growing confidence under Unai Emery.Nottingham Forest moved further clear of relegation danger with a commanding 3-0 victory over Tottenham. Callum Hudson Odoi struck twice to put the hosts firmly in control, before Ibrahim Sangare added a late third. The defeat leaves Tottenham with just one win in seven league matches, increasing the scrutiny on head coach Thomas Frank ahead of a difficult fixture against Liverpool.Sunderland claimed local bragging rights in the Tyne Wear derby with a 1-0 win over Newcastle. The decisive moment came shortly after halftime when Nick Woltemade inadvertently headed into his own net. It was a difficult afternoon for the German forward, who struggled to make an impact before being substituted late on.The results ensured the title chase remains intense, with Arsenal still leading but facing relentless pressure from City and a fast closing Aston Villa.",Manchester City beat Crystal Palace 3-0 at Selhurst Park.

Sachin"" chants returned to their peak when the cricket legend joined Messi on stage later in the evening.""I have spent some incredible moments here. A number of dreams have seen the finish line on this very venue. And without your support, we would never have seen those golden moments on this ground in 2011 (ODI World Cup).""""And today, having all three of them here is indeed a golden moment for Mumbai, Mumbaikars and India.""""When it comes to Leo, what does one talk about him?

Fans throw objects, vandalise stadium after Messi leaves early | Hyderabad next

NEW DELHI: The All India Football Federation (AIFF) president Kalyan Chaubey has broken his silence on the chaos that marred Lionel Messi’s much-hyped appearance in Kolkata, squarely blaming political grandstanding and serious lapses in protocol for the disorder at Salt Lake Stadium.Speaking to ANI on Sunday, Chaubey said the event had drifted far from its sporting purpose. “Yesterday, the event we saw, it became West Bengal Sports Minister's personal event. People have seen on the television or other medium more of the West Bengal Sports Minister than Messi. It was of personal canvassing, election canvassing, and using an international player for a completely vested interest. And I think this will cost Bengal in the future,” he said.Chaubey stressed that strict adherence to protocol was non-negotiable while hosting international stars.“Law will take its own course. Bengal need to take lessons very seriously. All the protocols need to be implemented strictly whenever we host an international event and an international star. Had these protocols been followed, then this problem wouldn’t have happened,” he added.The AIFF, in an official statement on Saturday, expressed deep concern over the events at the Vivekananda Yuba Bharati Krirangan, where around 50,000 fans had gathered to catch a glimpse of Messi, along with Luis Suarez and Rodrigo de Paul.Many spectators had paid between Rs 4,000 and Rs 12,000 for tickets, while some reportedly shelled out as much as Rs 20,000 on the black market.However, within minutes of Messi’s arrival, he was engulfed by politicians, VVIPs, police officers and aides, forming a human barricade that left paying fans frustrated and angry.Clarifying its position, the AIFF distanced itself from the event.“This was a private event organised by a PR agency. The AIFF was not involved in the organisation, planning, or execution of this event in any capacity,” the federation said, adding that no clearance had been sought.The situation spiralled out of control as angry fans hurled bottles, ripped out chairs and vandalised infrastructure.Fibreglass seats were smashed, canopies torn, and parts of the stadium damaged before police managed to restore order, leaving behind a night that promised celebration but ended in chaos.ALSO READ: GOAT India Tour: The story of Lionel Messi's signed jersey in Kolkata","The All India Football Federation president Kalyan Chaubey has broken his silence on the chaos that marred Lionel Messi’s much-hyped appearance in Kolkata.

After the fiasco of Kolkata earlier in the day, this city held its collective nerve to keep its date with Lionel Messi on Saturday.The city wore a festive look in anticipation of the Argentine super star’s arrival, but the state government machinery here was forced into overdrive after the event in Kolkata unravelled and put the whole G.O.A.T India Tour 2025 in peril.Fans turned up in large numbers from the neighbouring states of Kerala and Karnataka and the govt aided the build-up by billing it as a match between Messi and chief minister Revanth Reddy With the CM taking active interest, what was a packed schedule for Messi became more hectic.Messi was to oblige fans who paid nearly Rs 12 lakh (with tax) for a photo-op with him and an autographed Argentina jersey and greet fans at the Rajiv Gandhi stadium, where ticket prices ranged between Rs 2,250 and Rs 30,000.A kickabout between Messi and the CM was squeezed into the schedule after a concert by Rahul Sipligunj of RRR fame.Tension mounted as the clock ticked past 4.30 pm and Messi’s plane landed at the Shamshabad airport around the same time when news trickled in that Satadru Dutta, the event’s chief organiser, was detained by the Kolkata police.The unease dissipated when images started emerging of Messi walking out of the airport and reaching the swank hotel in the old city, where he obliged 250 autograph seekers.Meanwhile, security was beefed up at the Uppal stadium as fans began taking their seats when the gates opened at 4 pm. A laser show and Sipligunj kept the crowd entertained as Messi headed to the stadium along with the CM and leader of opposition, Rahul Gandhi.A wave from the legend was all that they had come for. Kolkata became a distant dream.",Messi was to oblige fans who paid nearly Rs 12 lakh (with tax) for a photo-op with him and an autographed Argentina jersey.

NEW DELHI: ""Maath theke beriye jaan, aapnara please maath theke beriye jaan (leave the field. Everyone, please leave the field now),"" begged Satadru Dutta as loudly as he could over the microphone.Dutta, the key man behind bringing Lionel Messi to India and Kolkata on Day 1 of the football legend’s ongoing ""GOAT Tour,"" desperately tried to regain control at the Salt Lake Stadium.But as his requests fell on deaf ears and people, understandably uninvited on the field, kept piling on in an attempt not just to see the 38-year-old up close, but also to click photos with him and even touch him, Messi's entourage decided to take matters into their own hands, bringing a premature end to the ill-organised proceedings. They left the stadium, which had turned into a circus by then, much earlier than originally planned.If we check the clock, Messi’s stay at the Salt Lake Stadium, also known as the Vivekananda Yuva Bharati Krirangan (VYBK), lasted less than 25 minutes.What happened after that is all over the internet. Mentioning it again won’t pacify broken hearts; it may well aggravate them.Before Messi arrived at VYBK, though, it was a pleasant, sunny Saturday morning in Kolkata, a perfect time when every Bengali heart demands an outing. And if a glimpse of what many consider the greatest footballer of all time is on offer, who dares to say no?Salt Lake Stadium thus saw an outpouring of people. It all began smoothly with singing and dancing performances, followed by an exhibition match between Mohun Bagan Messi All Stars and Diamond Harbour Messi All Stars, with all players wearing Messi’s name and No.10 on their backs.Playing for Diamond Harbour was former India international Mehtab Hossain, for whom featuring on the occasion of an Argentine legend’s visit had become something of a ritual. He had earlier played a friendly match during Diego Armando Maradona’s visit to Kolkata in 2017.Love for football took him to Salt Lake’s turf once again. But this time, unlike during Maradona’s visit, Mehtab was appalled by the ruckus the City of Joy had to witness.""The friendly match was great. After that, I shook hands with Messi. He signed my jersey,"" Mehtab told TimesofIndia.com during an exclusive interaction on Saturday evening.""First of all, Messi is a very innocent, humble, good human being. You can tell that from his body language. He comes from a different culture. After seeing the response he got here, he was excited. The crowd didn’t come to see Luis Suarez or Rodrigo De Paul. They just came to see Messi.""According to Mehtab, things began to spiral out of control when “influential people” repeatedly breached security protocols to get close to Messi.""C’mon, it’s Lionel Messi. Everyone wanted to go near him; everyone wanted to take a selfie,"" said Mehtab, one of the very few players who got the opportunity to have their jerseys signed by Leo on the ground right after the exhibition match.However, it was not in his destiny to keep it for long.""After the chaos, one kid came running up to me. He was crying because he wasn’t able to see Messi at all. I felt bad. He was crying so much that I gave him my signed jersey. I told him, ‘Don’t cry, kid. Take this jersey with you,’"" revealed the former East Bengal midfielder.While others would go home, hug their jerseys while sleeping and frame them the next day, Mehtab went home without the jersey, but with a broader smile and a heart full of satisfaction.Summing up the mood, Mehtab added, ""The influential people only wanted to take photos with Messi, but those who came after paying Rs 10,000, they were middle-class fans. They truly love Messi from the heart.""The powerful people just wanted to take pictures to prove their status. Seeing that made people even angrier, because they didn’t come to take photos; they came just to catch a glimpse of Messi.""",Lionel Messi visited Kolkata on Day 1 of his GOAT India Tour.

Vikings out of playoff contention



The end came quietly, without a snap or a whistle. While the Minnesota Vikings were preparing for a prime-time showdown in Dallas, their season slipped away hundreds of miles north at Soldier Field. A lopsided result involving two other teams sealed their fate, confirming what weeks of uneven football had already suggested. Hope lingered on paper, but reality arrived swiftly and without mercy.This is not how a season that began with expectations of relevance was supposed to close. Instead of a late push or dramatic finish, the Vikings now face the uncomfortable space between disappointment and reflection. At 5-8, they are left staring at a final stretch that no longer carries postseason weight, only questions about direction, decisions, and durability.The Minnesota Vikings were officially knocked out of the NFC playoff race after the Chicago Bears crushed the Cleveland Browns 31-3, eliminating the last remaining mathematical path. The Vikings did not control their own destiny, but the result still landed hard.For the second time in three seasons, January football will not include Minnesota.This marks the earliest postseason elimination for the franchise since 2011, a year that spiraled into a 3-13 finish. The contrast is sharp when viewed against last season’s 14-3 run with Sam Darnold, a campaign that briefly restored belief before ending in a Wild Card loss to the Los Angeles Rams. That momentum did not carry forward. Instead, this year unraveled through narrow defeats, injuries, and inconsistency.Head coach Kevin O’Connell now finds himself under a brighter spotlight. More than three seasons into his tenure, the absence of a playoff victory has become impossible to ignore. Early division success promised stability, yet the results since have raised questions about adaptability when adversity hits. Two years ago, a torn Achilles to Kirk Cousins derailed a promising stretch. This season brought its own setbacks, none bigger than the lack of continuity under center.J.J. McCarthy’s development stalled as injuries kept him off the field for extended stretches. An ankle issue and time in concussion protocol disrupted timing and confidence. In today’s NFL, stability at quarterback is not a luxury. It is a requirement. Without it, even well-built rosters struggle to stay afloat.Now the conversation shifts, reluctantly, toward April. Minnesota currently sits outside the top ten of the 2026 NFL Draft order, but that could change quickly. Losses down the stretch could improve positioning while giving the coaching staff a chance to evaluate younger players. Games against the Giants, Lions, and Packers will not define this season, but they may shape the next one.For a franchise caught between recent success and present frustration, the offseason begins early. The challenge ahead is clear. Turning lessons into progress will matter far more than the standings ever did.Also Read: 2025 NFL playoff picture: How Week 15 loss to Bills reshaped Patriots’ playoff seeding and Super Bowl odds","The Minnesota Vikings were officially knocked out of the NFC playoff race after the Chicago Bears crushed the Cleveland Browns 31-3.

Patriots AFC playoff picture after stunning Week 15 collapse



Sunday afternoon was supposed to feel like a celebration in Foxborough. For one quarter, it did. Gillette Stadium buzzed as the New England Patriots jumped all over the Buffalo Bills, playing with pace, confidence, and control. The scoreboard told a story of dominance early. By the end, it told a very different one, and the silence felt louder than any cheer.What should have been a statement win instead became a warning. The Patriots let a golden opportunity slip through their fingers, falling 35-31 after holding multiple commanding leads. The loss did more than sting emotionally. It reshaped the AFC landscape and narrowed the Patriots’ margin for error at the most critical point of the season.The immediate damage came fast. Despite building a 21-0 first-quarter lead and carrying a 24-7 advantage into halftime, New England could not slow Josh Allen once Buffalo found its rhythm. The Bills scored touchdowns on five straight drives and dominated the second half, outscoring the Patriots 28-7. Defensive breakdowns, missed opportunities, and a sudden shift in momentum turned a comfortable afternoon into a costly defeat.From a standings perspective, the timing could not have been worse. Every other AFC team that entered Week 15 in a playoff position and played Sunday came away with a win. That collective success magnified New England’s loss. The Denver Broncos moved into sole possession of the No. 1 seed, capitalizing on both their own victory and the Patriots’ stumble. Jacksonville also stayed hot, setting up a pivotal stretch run near the top of the conference.The silver lining for New England is control. Despite the setback, the Patriots remain firmly in charge of their AFC East fate. Winning out guarantees the division title. Even if they finish tied with Buffalo, New England currently holds an edge in division record, though that cushion remains thin with two division games still ahead.The race for the conference’s top seed is more complicated. Denver holds the tiebreaker based on common opponents, making New England’s path steeper. Still, the Broncos face a demanding closing schedule, including matchups with Jacksonville and the Chargers. That leaves the door cracked open if the Patriots can steady themselves and take advantage.Meanwhile, chaos elsewhere in the AFC adds intrigue. Kansas City’s shocking loss to the Chargers and Patrick Mahomes’ torn ACL officially removed the Chiefs from the playoff race, something that has not happened since 2014. That result reshuffled expectations and removed a familiar postseason obstacle.If the season ended now, New England would host Houston in the Wild Card round. But this Patriots team is not thinking about first-round matchups yet. The focus is sharper and simpler. Clean up the mistakes, finish strong, and make sure Sunday’s collapse becomes a lesson rather than a legacy.Also Read: Bills win big, but Josh Allen’s calm handling of Hailee Steinfeld pregnancy question proves his MVP leadership off field","The New England Patriots lost 35-31 to the Buffalo Bills on Sunday.

Green Bay Packers star pass rusher Micah Parsons exits with knee injury



The silence came quickly, spreading through the stadium as Micah Parsons lay on the turf late in the third quarter. In a game already defined by physical play and mounting injuries, the sight of Green Bay’s defensive centerpiece clutching his knee shifted the tone instantly. What followed was concern, uncertainty, and a collective pause from both sidelines as trainers rushed out.For the Packers, Micah Parsons represents more than production. He is the engine of their pass rush, the pressure point offenses plan around all week. Losing him, even temporarily, creates ripples that reach far beyond one Sunday afternoon. As Green Bay continues to chase consistency in a crowded playoff picture, this moment could linger longer than the final score.Micah Parsons was forced to exit Sunday’s game against the Denver Broncos after suffering a non-contact left knee injury and was ruled out for the remainder of the contest. The injury occurred with 55 seconds left in the third quarter as Denver drove the ball from the Packers’ 29-yard line. On a first down play, Parsons broke through the offensive line, but planted awkwardly while closing in on quarterback Bo Nix and immediately went down grabbing his left knee.Trainers attended to him on the field as players from both teams took a knee. Parsons remained down for several moments before getting to his feet. While he was able to walk, he required assistance heading to the locker room. The Packers initially listed him as questionable, but later confirmed he would not return. As he left the field, the All-Pro could be heard saying, ""I'm out.""The injury compounded a difficult day for Green Bay. Wide receiver Christian Watson and tight end Josh Whyle had already suffered game-ending injuries earlier. Offensive lineman Zach Tom and safety Evan Williams were also hurt, leaving the Packers stretched thin across multiple position groups.Parsons’ absence is especially significant given his impact this season. Entering Sunday, he had recorded 39 tackles, 12.5 sacks, 26 quarterback hits, and a forced fumble. He also made history as the first player since sacks became an official stat in 1982 to begin a career with five straight seasons of at least 12 sacks.Green Bay invested heavily in Parsons after acquiring him from the Dallas Cowboys in exchange for defensive tackle Kenny Clark and two first-round picks. The team followed that move with a four-year, $188 million contract extension. Now, the Packers can only wait for further evaluation, hoping the injury does not alter the trajectory of their season.Also Read: Who is Bo Nix’s wife Izzy?

Who is Bo Nix's wife Izzy?



How Bo and Izzy met and built their life together



The Denver Broncos believed they had secured stability when they used the 12th pick of the 2024 NFL Draft on Bo Nix. That belief quickly turned into results. Nix delivered playoff football to Denver for the first time in years and gave the franchise a calm, confident presence under center. While fans focused on his poise in the pocket, those closest to him saw something else driving the rise. Behind the headlines and highlight throws stands a partner who has walked each uncertain step with him.Away from the roar of the stadium, Nix’s life is grounded in family, faith, and familiarity. Long before the NFL spotlight arrived, his personal foundation was already set. That foundation begins with his wife, Izzy Nix, whose story is woven deeply into his journey from college football pressure to professional promise.Izzy Nix, born Izzy Smoke, is more than a familiar face in the stands on Sundays. Raised in Birmingham, Alabama, she grew up immersed in sports, discipline, and competition. Gymnastics shaped her early years, demanding balance, resilience, and focus. Those traits carried into high school, where she also played soccer and basketball, winning a girls’ championship in 2017.She later attended Auburn University, earning a Bachelor of Science in Exercise Science with minors in Psychology and Sport Coaching.Her passion for fitness never faded. Today, Izzy works as a fitness coach at F45 Training, blending science, motivation, and movement. Her background as a former Auburn cheerleader and lifelong athlete mirrors the drive that defines her husband’s career.Izzy’s voice has often reflected quiet conviction rather than flash. After Bo entered the NFL, she shared a message that captured her long view of his path: “The day I met Bo, he told me about this God-sized dream of his. I will never stop praising the Lord for His faithfulness or have enough words to express how proud I am of you, Bo.”Their story began at Auburn, where routines overlapped and ambition connected them. Bo was leading the Tigers as quarterback. Izzy earned a spot on the cheer team despite no prior experience. Competition, faith, and shared goals drew them closer. As Izzy once explained, “Bo and I are equally competitive and ambitious. We both grew up playing multiple sports and were taught to never back down from a challenge. We push each other towards our goals and to be better versions of ourselves daily. ”Bo proposed in July 2021 at Jordan-Hare Stadium, a place filled with shared memories. He later wrote, “God is so good! I knew from the first moment I laid eyes on you that you were special. I cannot wait to be your husband. Here’s to forever with you, Izzy Smoke!”They married on July 2, 2022, in Alpine, Alabama, before moving to Oregon for Bo’s final college chapter. Today, as Denver looks ahead with hope, Bo Nix already knows the constant he can count on. His future was never built alone.Also Read: Patrick Mahomes's wife Brittany's game-day fashion ages badly as Chiefs’ disastrous defeat overshadows her attention-grabbing fit","Izzy Nix, born Izzy Smoke, is more than a familiar face in the stands on Sundays.

Patrick Mahomes injury leaves Kansas City Chiefs facing rare playoff absence



The stadium grew quiet long before the final whistle. For years, Arrowhead had been the place where seasons stayed alive, where January plans felt automatic. On Sunday, that certainty disappeared. A loss to the Los Angeles Chargers did more than end a game. It snapped a decade-long habit of playoff football and left Kansas City staring at an unfamiliar offseason.The moment that froze everything came late. Patrick Mahomes went down on the final drive, his knee buckling as bodies collapsed around him. Teammates waved urgently. Trainers rushed in. The face of the franchise was helped off, and with him went the last sliver of hope. Nearby, Brittany Mahomes watched in disbelief, her striking custom Chiefs outfit suddenly out of place against the weight of the scene.This loss landed harder because of what Mahomes represents. Drafted in 2017 out of Texas Tech, he turned stability into routine dominance. Every season brought playoff football. Five Super Bowl trips followed. Three Lombardi Trophies came home. That history made Sunday feel surreal, almost wrong.Kansas City still showed flashes. Mahomes completed 16 of 28 passes for 189 yards and scored early with a 12-yard rushing touchdown. His season totals reflect a year of resistance rather than ease: 3,587 passing yards, 22 touchdowns, and 11 interceptions. Yet numbers could not soften the ending. The Chiefs fell to 6-8 and out of contention, closing a run of 10 straight postseasons and seven under Mahomes.The injury now looms largest. Head coach Andy Reid did not hide the concern afterward. ""Patrick hurt his left knee. We'll get an MRI (Monday) or this evening whenever they get him in there,"" a somber Reid explained. The locker room mood matched his tone.Patrick Mahomes later spoke directly to fans, blending pain with resolve. ""Don't know why this had to happen. And not going to lie it's hurts,"" Mahomes said on social media. ""But all we can do now is Trust in God and attack every single day over and over again. Thank you Chiefs kingdom for always supporting me and for everyone who has reached out and sent prayers. I Will be back stronger than ever.""Through a difficult season, Brittany Mahomes remained a visible lift, from thoughtful game-day fashion to moments shared with their children. On this night, even that brightness could not cut through the disappointment.Kansas City now waits for medical answers and a long winter. The playoffs will feel different without the Chiefs. For the first time in years, the league moves on without Mahomes chasing another January run.Also Read: Bills win big, but Josh Allen’s calm handling of Hailee Steinfeld pregnancy question proves his MVP leadership off field","Patrick Mahomes went down on the final drive, his knee buckling as bodies collapsed around him.

"Philip Rivers Net Worth in 2025: How longevity, massive contracts, and smart choices shaped the Colts quarterback’s fortune",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/philip-rivers-net-worth-in-2025-how-longevity-massive-contracts-and-smart-choices-shaped-the-colts-quarterbacks-fortune/articleshow/125968339.cms,"Philip Rivers' $100 million net worth stems from his remarkable NFL durability and consistent performance over 17 seasons, earning over $240 million. His career, marked by smart contracts and stability, saw him command top dollar, even securing a $25 million deal late in his career. His unexpected 2025 return to the Colts highlights his enduring competitive spirit.

How Philip Rivers turned durability and timing into one of the NFL’s biggest career paydays

Philip Rivers built his legacy long before conversations about net worth ever followed his name. Known for durability, toughness, and an ironman-like presence under center, Rivers turned consistency into long-term financial power. Over nearly two decades in the NFL, his value was rarely questioned, and franchises paid accordingly.Now back in the spotlight after an unexpected return to the Indianapolis Colts in 2025, interest in Philip Rivers’ net worth and career earnings has surged again. His financial story isn’t built on flashy endorsements or sudden spikes, but on sustained excellence, timing, and stability, the same traits that defined his approach to football and life beyond the huddle.According to Celebrity Net Worth, Philip Rivers’ net worth in 2025 is estimated at $100 million, a figure that reflects both elite quarterback compensation and disciplined decision-making off the field.Over 17 NFL seasons, Rivers earned his wealth the traditional way: staying healthy, starting every week, and commanding trust from his teams. That reliability translated into contracts that consistently placed him among the league’s top earners throughout the 2010s.His total NFL career earnings surpassed $240 million, built across long tenures with the San Diego/Los Angeles Chargers and a final full season with the Indianapolis Colts in 2020. One of the defining moments of his financial peak came in 2015, when he signed a four-year, $84 million extension with the Chargers, a deal that cemented his place among the NFL’s financial elite. His final pre-retirement contract, a one-year, fully guaranteed $25 million deal with the Colts, further underscored how teams valued his experience even late in his career.In 2025, Rivers’ return to Indianapolis came under very different financial circumstances. Joining the practice squad amid quarterback injuries, his current salary remains undisclosed, though the move appears driven more by opportunity and competitiveness than money. Still, the comeback adds another chapter to a career already defined by rare longevity.Rivers’ financial footprint also extends into real estate. In Indiana, he purchased a “modest” home by pro-athlete standards for just under $1 million, later listing it for $1.05 million. In California, he sold a significantly larger property valued at $4.2 million, featuring luxury amenities befitting a long-time franchise quarterback.Ultimately, Philip Rivers’ net worth reflects more than earnings. It tells the story of a quarterback who maximized every season, avoided financial volatility, and quietly built generational stability, on the field, at home, and now, unexpectedly, back in the NFL spotlight.Also Read: Philip Rivers didn’t have anything left, so he pulled cleats from his trophy case — a story of his comeback","Philip Rivers' net worth in 2025 is estimated at $100 million, according to Celebrity Net Worth.

Josh Allen delivers an MVP moment on and off the field



What unfolded around Josh Allen this week felt bigger than football, yet it somehow made his performance on the field even louder. Personal joy and professional pressure collided in a way few athletes experience, let alone handle with grace. The Buffalo Bills quarterback stepped into a spotlight that followed him from a snowy family moment at home straight into one of the toughest road environments in the NFL The timing could not have been more intense. With the AFC East race tightening and the New England Patriots standing in Buffalo’s way, Allen carried more than a game plan into Gillette Stadium. He carried momentum, emotion, and expectation. What followed was not just a comeback win, but a reminder of why leadership still defines greatness in this league.Josh Allen’s week began with life changing news. Fresh off a lavish Southern California wedding on May 31, Allen and his wife, actress Hailee Steinfeld , shared a joyful announcement that they are expecting their first child. The video, filmed in the snow back in Buffalo, felt intimate and real. It showed a side of the quarterback fans rarely see. Calm. Grounded. Happy.Hours later, that same man walked into Foxborough facing a Patriots team sitting atop the AFC East.The game started brutally. Buffalo fell behind 21-0 and later trailed 24-7 at halftime. The stadium felt heavy. The moment looked too big. Then Allen flipped the script.The Bills played inspired football in the second half, leaning on Allen’s poise and precision. He finished the day with 193 passing yards, three touchdown throws, and 47 rushing yards in a stunning 35-31 win. Buffalo improved to 10-4, while New England slipped to 11-3. The victory split the season series and cut the Patriots’ divisional lead to one game, keeping Buffalo firmly in the AFC East hunt.After the game, Allen faced an awkward question linking on-field performance to his pregnancy announcement. The reporter asked, “Is there some power to maybe Dawson Knox having his daughter this week? You announcing that you will soon be expecting in terms of the production we saw on this field?” Allen did not hesitate. He replied, “I don't know about that. I'm obviously very happy and very blessed. I love my team. I love my wife. She's my favorite teammate.”That answer landed as cleanly as any touchdown pass. It showed respect, warmth, and maturity. Buffalo’s road ahead remains demanding, with Cleveland, Philadelphia, and the Jets still to come. New England faces its own grind. Yet suddenly, the idea of a Bills Super Bowl run, in their final season at a worn but beloved stadium, with Allen’s first child on the way, no longer feels poetic in theory. It feels possible.Also Read: Hailee Steinfeld’s adorable pregnancy reveal sends Josh Allen and half of Hollywood into full celebration mode","Josh Allen and his wife, actress Hailee Steinfeld, announced that they are expecting their first child.

How a dynasty-caliber run unraveled into a lost season

The Kansas City Chiefs’ once-unthinkable fall from perennial Super Bowl contenders became official in Week 15, and it happened in the most painful way possible. A narrow home loss to the Los Angeles Chargers didn’t just end Kansas City’s playoff hopes, it raised serious questions about the immediate future of the franchise.With Patrick Mahomes leaving the field late after a scary knee injury, the night felt symbolic of a season that steadily slipped out of control. Injuries, inconsistency, and lost late-game magic finally caught up to a team that had defined NFL dominance for nearly a decade. What followed Sunday night wasn’t just elimination, but a moment of reckoning for a Chiefs era that suddenly looks vulnerable.Mahomes’ exit with 1:53 remaining turned Arrowhead silent. The quarterback was scrambling when Chargers defensive lineman Da’Shawn Hand dragged him down from behind, immediately grabbing his left knee. Medical staff helped him limp off, and Andy Reid did little to soften the concern afterward, admitting the injury “didn’t look good” and confirming Mahomes would undergo an MRI.The timing made it worse. Kansas City trailed just 16-13 with the ball at midfield, still very much alive.Gardner Minshew stepped in, but the comeback died quickly when Derwin James Jr. intercepted a late pass. Mahomes finished with 189 passing yards and a rushing touchdown, yet the numbers felt secondary to the sight of him hobbling toward the locker room.Given that he had already been managing a minor knee issue earlier in the season, the MRI now carries weight not just for 2025, but for how cautiously the Chiefs approach the final weeks.The loss dropped Kansas City to 6-8 and officially eliminated them from postseason contention, snapping a streak of 10 straight playoff appearances and five Super Bowl trips in six years. Several factors converged. Mahomes was less efficient all season, the offensive line battled constant injuries, and the offense never found a consistent rhythm beyond flashes.Defensively, the pass rush failed to complement a strong secondary, forcing coordinator Steve Spagnuolo to gamble more than usual. Special teams, once a quiet advantage, became unreliable. Add a brutal schedule and repeated failures in one-possession games, and the margin for error vanished.This wasn’t a collapse built on one bad night. Week 15 simply confirmed what had been building all season: the Chiefs lost their edge, and for the first time in the Mahomes era.Also Read: Brittany Mahomes turns heads with an elegant holiday look at the Chiefs’ Christmas gathering","Kansas City Chiefs' playoff hopes ended with a painful home loss to the Chargers.

Who is Arthur Jones' wife? Exploring the personal life of Super Bowl champion who passed away at 39,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/who-is-arthur-jones-wife-exploring-the-personal-life-of-super-bowl-champion-who-passed-away-at-39/articleshow/125968299.cms,"Former NFL star Arthur Jones, a Super Bowl XLVII winner with the Ravens, has passed away at 39. Known for his private life, Jones was a devoted father to two children and deeply valued family, a trait shaped by early losses. His resilience and quiet strength defined his journey beyond the gridiron.

Exploring Arthur Jones’ private life with his wife and children after his sudden death

The sudden passing of former NFL defensive end Arthur Jones at the age of 39 sent shockwaves through the football world and beyond. Known for his grit on the field and his role in helping the Baltimore Ravens win Super Bowl XLVII, Jones lived a life shaped by both public triumph and deeply personal struggles. While his professional career was well-documented, Arthur Jones’ private life remained intentionally low-profile.In the days following his death, many fans have sought to understand the man beyond the helmet; his family, his relationships, and the quiet life he built away from the spotlight. From enduring family tragedies to embracing fatherhood, Jones’ personal journey reveals a story defined by resilience, loyalty, and love.Arthur Jones was reportedly married to Sunny Zupanic, a relationship he kept far from public view throughout his NFL career and retirement. Unlike many professional athletes who share their family lives online, Jones chose privacy, prioritizing normalcy for his loved ones.Together, Arthur and Sunny were parents to two children, Art IV and Skyler, aged 15 and 11. Friends and those close to the family have described Jones as a deeply involved father who valued time at home, often finding comfort in simple routines and his love for animals, including several family dogs.Family played a defining role in Arthur’s life. He was one of four siblings, including NFL star Chandler Jones and UFC legend Jon Jones. Their bond was forged through shared ambition and early hardship. The family suffered devastating losses long before Arthur’s passing; their older sister, Carmen, died from a brain tumor in 2000, and their mother, Camille, passed away in 2017 due to diabetes-related complications. These experiences shaped Arthur’s grounded personality and his decision to keep his own family shielded from public scrutiny.Jon Jones once reflected on Arthur’s discipline and mindset, stating, “The dedication that it would take for him to get down to the 265 heavyweight limit. I think it would transform him mentally into the warrior he needs to be to compete at a high level. And he would be faster than ever and mentally a stronger person. I think he would make a great contender, if not champion, in the UFC.”Arthur Jones reportedly passed away due to heart-related complications, having previously been diagnosed with cardiac issues and fitted with a pacemaker and defibrillator. His former Ravens team honored him by saying, “Arthur’s presence was a gift to everyone he encountered. His big, bright smile, infectious energy and eternal positivity created a presence that continuously uplifted others.”Beyond his athletic achievements, Arthur Jones leaves behind a legacy rooted in family, quiet strength, and unwavering love.Also Read: Arthur Jones cause of death: How did the Ravens’ Super Bowl champion die at 39","Former NFL star Arthur Jones has passed away at the age of 39.

Meet Philip Rivers’ 10 kids and grandchild as the 44-year-old quarterback makes a stunning NFL comeback,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/meet-philip-rivers-10-kids-and-grandchild-as-the-44-year-old-quarterback-makes-a-stunning-nfl-comeback/articleshow/125962909.cms,"Philip Rivers family (Credit: Philip Rivers)

Philip Rivers and Tiffany Rivers raise ten children while keeping family first





Philip Rivers never separated football from life. The same discipline that defined his years under center also shaped his home, where time, structure, and presence mattered more than headlines. Long before packed stadiums and playoff races, Rivers was building something quieter and far more lasting with his wife, Tiffany. Their story began in middle school, deepened through college, and matured alongside a growing household that eventually turned heads across the NFL Even during the busiest seasons of his career, Rivers stayed anchored to faith and family. That grounding showed in how he spoke about fatherhood, not as a balancing act but as a responsibility he chose daily. In May 2019, he summed it up simply while speaking to the Chargers: ""Be present. Just try to be there. Children want our time."" That philosophy followed him through retirement in 2021 and even into late 2025, when a reported workout with the Colts sparked talk of a return. Football may still call, but family has always answered first.Halle, the oldest at 23, arrived in 2002 while Philip and Tiffany were still students at North Carolina State.She saw firsthand how her father separated work from home. “He’s so selfless,” Halle Rivers told the Chargers in 2019. “He’s an NFL quarterback; he’s doing a million different things every day, but every day he comes home, and he wants to be with us. If he has one extra minute that he could do something else, he’ll be with us. ” By 2025, Philip had added another title when he revealed to Jon Gruden that he had become a grandfather six months earlier.Caroline, 20, mirrors her father’s drive. “We are a lot alike,” Philip Rivers told the Indianapolis Star in 2020. He added, “Caroline is very strong-willed, and I say that as a huge compliment.” Grace, 19, brings balance. “She goes with the flow,” Rivers said, calling her versatility a defining trait.Gunner, 17, carries resilience beyond his years after being diagnosed with type 1 diabetes at age five. Tiffany framed it plainly in 2019: “It’s our everyday. It’s our normal. It’s definitely a part of our life now.” Philip described Gunner’s football curiosity with pride, noting their pregame talks about trick plays and postgame breakdowns.The younger children each bring their own energy. Sarah, 15, is endlessly expressive. “Sarah’s got a big personality, loves to talk,” Rivers said. Peter, 14, earned the label of an old soul, while Rebecca, 12, and Clare, 10, share a birthday and a stubborn streak their father admires. Anna, 6, lights up rooms with humor. Andrew, born in October 2023, closed the circle. As Rivers told AL.com, “It doesn’t matter if it’s the first child or the 10th child. It’s an awesome miracle every time.”Also Read: Will Philip Rivers play tonight's game against Seattle Seahawks?

“Disaster”: UNC recruit’s leaked comment on Bill Belichick’s girlfriend Jordon Hudson ignites fresh controversy,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/disaster-unc-recruits-leaked-comment-on-bill-belichicks-girlfriend-jordon-hudson-ignites-fresh-controversy/articleshow/125960797.cms,"Bill Belichick's first season at UNC faced scrutiny beyond football, with off-field drama surrounding his personal life impacting recruit perceptions. While his ""business-like"" NFL approach resonates, unwanted distractions threaten to overshadow the program's rebuild. Belichick must balance elite coaching appeal with a clean focus on football to regain control of the narrative.

A recruit’s candid view underscores the balance Bill Belichick must strike at UNC

Bill Belichick’s first season at North Carolina was always going to be scrutinized, but not just for football reasons. The six-time Super Bowl winning coach arrived in Chapel Hill with unmatched pedigree and an NFL-style reputation, yet Year 1 quickly became a blend of rebuilding pains and constant off-field chatter.While the Tar Heels’ 4–8 finish and blowout loss to NC State ended hopes of momentum on the field, the program has remained a talking point nationally because of Belichick’s personal life. As recruiting ramps up for the next cycle, that attention has now reached the ears of prospects, one of whom has offered a candid reaction that highlights a growing tension between elite coaching appeal and unwanted distractions.According to reports, a UNC football recruit admitted he was uncomfortable with the off-field drama surrounding Belichick and his 24-year-old girlfriend, Jordon Hudson. While the comment was not meant as a direct attack, it revealed a reality many programs quietly face: recruits want stability, structure, and a clean focus on football. The idea of being pulled into personal controversy, even indirectly, can be a turnoff for players trying to launch their careers.At the same time, the recruit’s perspective was not entirely negative. Belichick’s approach inside the program still resonates strongly with prospects. As one report noted, “The legendary head coach has installed a ‘business-like’ approach at UNC, which recruits are apparently buying into.” That professional tone, shaped by decades in the NFL, remains one of Belichick’s biggest selling points despite the losing season.UNC is clearly attempting to reset. “Despite the season ending in disaster, with a 42-19 defeat to rivals NC State, the Tar Heels are retooling ahead of next year with a revamped roster.” Recruiting insiders believe Belichick’s long-term vision and credibility still carry weight, especially with players who value development over short-term wins.Complicating matters further is reported tension within Belichick’s own family. An ultimatum allegedly delivered by his daughter-in-law, Jen, has kept the spotlight on Hudson and intensified public scrutiny. Accusations that Hudson is controlling, along with criticism of her appearance, have fueled tabloid-style narratives that spill into sports coverage.For now, Belichick appears unmoved, standing by his relationship while continuing to reshape UNC football. The challenge ahead is clear: maintaining the disciplined, no-nonsense culture recruits respect, while ensuring off-field headlines don’t overshadow the program’s rebuild. If Belichick can reassert control of the narrative with wins and player development, the noise may eventually fade.Also Read: Bill Belichick and Jordon Hudson unexpectedly pulled into Sherrone Moore’s Michigan scandal as comparisons fuel controversy","Bill Belichick's first season at North Carolina was always going to be scrutinized, but not just for football reasons.

“A much bigger puzzle”: Gisele Bündchen and Tom Brady’s divorce followed years of shifting priorities and emotional growth,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/a-much-bigger-puzzle-gisele-bndchen-and-tom-bradys-divorce-followed-years-of-shifting-priorities-and-emotional-growth/articleshow/125960667.cms,"Tom Brady and Gisele Bündchen's divorce, once a subject of intense speculation, is now understood as a quiet unraveling. Sources reveal the split stemmed from two individuals growing in different directions, not a single dramatic event. Both have spoken of mutual respect and the natural evolution of long marriages, emphasizing personal growth over conflict.

Why Tom Brady and Gisele Bündchen divorced after growing in different directions

When Tom Brady and Gisele Bündchen finalized their divorce in 2022, the split instantly became one of the most analyzed celebrity breakups in sports history. At the time, speculation raced ahead of facts: football, fame and ultimatums. Yet with distance and reflection, a clearer and more human picture has emerged. This was not a sudden collapse, but the quiet unraveling of two lives that slowly began moving in different directions.Brady and Bündchen built a shared world rooted in ambition, family, and mutual sacrifice. For years, that balance held. But long marriages evolve, and so do the people inside them. As Bündchen later explained, love alone does not always guarantee alignment. Their divorce, now viewed in hindsight, reflected emotional growth rather than public drama or a single breaking point.In a 2023 Vanity Fair interview, Bündchen directly addressed the real reason behind the split. “Sometimes you grow together; sometimes you grow apart,” she said. “That doesn’t mean you don’t love the person.” She described marriage as “a dance” that requires balance and compromise, adding that authenticity sometimes means accepting when two people can no longer meet in the middle.Importantly, Bündchen rejected the idea that Brady’s football career alone caused the divorce. “What’s been said is one piece of a much bigger puzzle,” she explained. “It’s not so black and white.” She emphasized that she never wanted to control Brady’s choices, saying, “When you love someone, you don’t put them in a jail and say, ‘You have to live this life.’ You set them free to be who they are.”Both Brady and Bündchen echoed that tone when announcing their divorce. Brady wrote, “We arrived at this decision amicably and with gratitude for the time we spent together.” Bündchen shared a similar message, noting, “The decision to end a marriage is never easy, but we have grown apart.”Over the years, reports suggested long standing tension around priorities, time, and personal identity. Friends close to the couple later indicated those challenges had existed for nearly a decade. By the time the marriage ended, the decision was less about conflict and more about acceptance.Looking back now, their divorce reads less like a celebrity implosion and more like a difficult but honest conclusion. Two people who shared a life, raised children together, and ultimately chose growth over staying in something that no longer fit.Also Read: Gisele Bündchen tearfully opens up about the pain of her divorce from Tom Brady in a heartfelt interview","Tom Brady and Gisele Bündchen finalized their divorce in 2022.

Khloé Kardashian Amari care role reflects deeper family commitment



Khloé Kardashian did not soften her words this weekend. Recently, she met online cruelty head-on, responding to comments that questioned why Tristan Thompson’s younger brother, Amari, attends dance classes.At a time when public figures often choose silence, Kardashian chose clarity. Speaking directly to her audience, she addressed the remarks that followed a previous post showing Amari enjoying his dance class. Her tone stayed firm, protective, and deeply personal, shaped by years of hands-on responsibility and lived experience.In a video shared to her Instagram Stories, Kardashian explained what prompted her response. “Last time I posted Amari in his dance class, I heard some ridiculous commentary about how, ‘How is this dance? Does he even know what’s going on?’” she said.She made it clear that such reactions crossed a line. “All of this gross commentary that I don’t need [and] no one needs,” she added.Kardashian then delivered a direct message to critics. “So, if you don’t know or if you have never had someone with special needs in your life and you don’t know what their interests are or what makes them happy, don’t comment.And if you don’t like this type of content, you don’t have to watch it. We’re all good over here.”Kardashian confirmed she had permission to share footage from Amari’s class, explaining her goal clearly. “I want to highlight such an amazing dance academy that does so much for special children,” she said. “And it’s so beautiful and it’s so special and these kids are so happy.”Kardashian’s involvement in Amari’s life goes far beyond posting videos. After the death of Tristan Thompson’s mother, Andrea, in January 2023, Kardashian stepped in as Amari’s primary caregiver due to Thompson’s demanding NBA schedule.She has openly shared why that decision mattered to her. “Tristan is in the NBA and he is in a different state, literally, every other day or every few days, and it’s just not conducive for Amari to be on that many planes,” she explained previously. “Amari has a handful of seizures a day with the type of epilepsy that he has.”Now based in Los Angeles, Amari receives full-time care with the help of professional caretakers. Kardashian has also spoken about the importance of inclusion for her own children. She believes being around Amari helps them understand compassion and humanity at an early age.Alongside clips from the dance class, Kardashian shared a photo with Amari and his instructors, writing, “I’m so thankful for places like this and for human beings like this!”Also Read: “I used to hate…” – Shaquille O’Neal makes an honest confession about $165 million Lakers star in candid chat with Carmelo Anthony","Khloé Kardashian responded to gross commentary aimed at Tristan Thompson’s brother, Amari. “All of this gross commentary that I don’t need [and] no one needs,” she said.

Why the Golden State Warriors may move on

What comes next for Gary Payton II

The Golden State Warriors could soon be facing a difficult roster decision, with one long-time contributor potentially nearing the end of his run in the Bay Area. According to Blue Man Hoop’s Tyler Watts, the franchise appears to be gradually moving on from Gary Payton II, the son of Hall of Fame former Los Angeles Lakers guard Gary Payton.Payton II, once a vital defensive spark for a championship team, has seen his role shrink significantly this season. With his on-court impact declining and Golden State prioritizing flexibility and youth, Watts believes the writing may already be on the wall.“The Golden State Warriors are slowly moving away from Gary Payton II,” Watts wrote Friday. “They just did this with Kevon Looney, and he wasn’t the first member of their dynasty to decline his way off the franchise.” (H/t: Sporting News)Golden State Warriors have never been sentimental when it comes to sustaining its championship window. Over the past few seasons, the organization has quietly phased out key contributors from its dynasty era once their production dipped below rotation-level standards.Payton now appears to be the next name on that list. Watts summed up the emotional weight of the situation, writing: “GP2 is a legend in the Bay Area, but his time with the Warriors is ending. Fans should savor the final moments while they still can.”Gary Payton II joined the Golden State Warriors in 2020 and quickly carved out a niche under head coach Steve Kerr.Despite standing just 6-foot-2, the Oregon State product became one of the league’s most disruptive perimeter defenders.His impact during Golden State’s 2021–22 title run was undeniable. Payton’s on-ball pressure, help defense, and timely three-point shooting gave the Warriors a unique defensive weapon in their guard rotation, playing a meaningful role in the franchise’s fourth championship of the Stephen Curry era.After the championship season, Gary Payton II left Golden State Warriors following the 2021–22 campaign, only to return midway through the 2022–23 season. The reunion initially brought optimism, but his role has steadily declined since then.This season, Payton has struggled to earn consistent minutes in Kerr’s rotation. His defensive impact has not been as disruptive as in prior years, and his perimeter shooting has dipped to a level that limits his lineup versatility.Payton’s statistical output reflects his fringe role with the team.While his overall field goal efficiency remains respectable, the drop in three-point shooting has been a major concern for a Warriors team that relies heavily on spacing.Several factors are working against Payton as Golden State evaluates its roster:• Declining perimeter shooting efficiency• Reduced defensive impact compared to peak seasons• Limited offensive versatility in lineups needing spacing• Organizational trend of moving on from aging dynasty contributorsAs Watts noted, Payton’s nine years of NBA experience may not be enough to secure his place if his performance does not improve quickly.If Gary Payton II fails to elevate his play in the coming weeks, a change of scenery could be inevitable. His defensive instincts and championship experience still hold value around the league, particularly for teams seeking depth and veteran presence.Also read: NBA trade rumors: Los Angeles Lakers predicted to sign $68 million New Orleans Pelicans superstar, Maxi Kleber key trade asset? For the Warriors, however, the focus appears to be shifting toward maximizing roster efficiency rather than holding onto familiar faces.

He controls games at his own pace and bends defenses without relying on speed or vertical force. That reality recently pulled an unexpected confession from one of basketball’s most dominant legends.During a recent candid moment on The Big Podcast, Shaquille O’Neal admitted that his view of Doncic did not always come with admiration. Sitting alongside Carmelo Anthony, Shaq peeled back years of skepticism after seeing the Lakers star up close. However, the NBA legend went on to shower him with respect, as he had earned it through his understanding of modern basketball.Shaquille O’Neal has never hesitated to call out what he sees, and his Luka Doncic admission carried that same honesty. Speaking openly, the Hall of Famer shared how live exposure changed everything. “I used to hate on Luka for the longest, and then I seen him play live. I know he’s really good but how come people can’t stop him?”Carmelo Anthony offered a short explanation. “The game evolved,” he said, though it failed to fully satisfy Shaq.That frustration led to a deeper breakdown from the Big Diesel himself.“He’s not really fast, he don’t have a lot of lift, but he be busting everybody up. I’m like ‘Bro, block his shot!'”The answer lies in control. Doncic understands angles, timing, and space better than most defenders understand their own help schemes. He slows the game, accelerates when needed, and uses his body to create separation. That ability to stop suddenly during a sprint opens clean looks during fast breaks and half court sets alike.Luka Doncic has never needed explosive athleticism to produce elite numbers. His scoring touch, vision, and patience allow him to dismantle switches and punish defensive mistakes. This season with the Lakers, he is averaging 34.4 points, 8.9 rebounds, and 8.9 assists per game while sitting firmly in the MVP conversation.He leads the NBA in scoring, operates comfortably in late-clock moments, and adapts seamlessly alongside LeBron James, who has leaned into a connector role.His arrival as the Lakers’ long-term centerpiece feels inevitable. If Los Angeles holds its place atop the Western Conference, Luka’s first MVP award may be a matter of timing.Also Read: “I’m gonna miss him” – Dwyane Wade gets emotional in heartfelt tribute as LeBron James’ historic NBA career draws praise","Shaquille O’Neal admitted that his view of Luka Doncic did not always come with admiration.

Golden State Warriors vs Portland Trail Blazers: Game Context and Stakes (December 14, 2025)

Stephen Curry’s Impact on the 2025 Season

against the Portland Trail Blazers on December 14, 2025, delivering a major boost to the Golden State Warriors as they continue navigating a tight Western Conference race. After missing time with a left quadriceps contusion and muscle strain, the two-time MVP is no longer listed on the official injury report and is expected to take the floor at the Moda Center.Stephen Curry’s return comes at an ideal moment for Golden State. With the schedule intensifying and playoff positioning already taking shape, having their offensive engine fully available stabilizes rotations and restores the spacing that defines the Warriors’ identity. Fans in Portland can expect the familiar sight of deep pull-up threes and off-ball chaos as Curry resumes his role at the heart of the offense.Stephen Curry originally suffered the quad injury on November 26 against the Houston Rockets, forcing him to the sidelines as Golden State took a cautious approach with its franchise star. The injury required focused rehab to restore full range of motion and strength, particularly in the vastus medialis oblique (VMO) area of the quad.In total, Curry missed five games while working through the recovery process.By December 11, Curry had ramped up his on-court activity, participating fully in practices and expressing confidence that a return was imminent. That optimism proved justified earlier this week when he returned against the Minnesota Timberwolves. In limited minutes, Curry looked comfortable and efficient, showing no visible restrictions or lingering effects from the injury.Sunday’s matchup marks the third meeting between the Golden State Warriors and Portland Trail Blazers this season. Golden State has held the upper hand so far, leaning heavily on Curry’s scoring bursts to tilt momentum in prior contests. His availability once again shifts the balance in the Warriors’ favor.Golden State Warriors also receive a lift with Draymond Green returning after missing time for personal reasons, strengthening the frontcourt and defensive communication. Portland, meanwhile, enters the game shorthanded. Donovan Clingan is listed as questionable, while other rotation pieces, including Al Horford, who is dealing with back problems, remain unavailable. Tip-off is set for Sunday evening, setting the stage for a potentially high-scoring affair if Curry quickly finds his rhythm.Stephen Curry is averaging around 27 points per game this season, supported by elite three-point volume that continues to warp defensive game plans. His presence immediately elevates Golden State Warriors’ offensive efficiency, creating cleaner looks not just for himself but for shooters and cutters throughout the lineup.The speed of Curry’s recovery underscores his veteran savvy and conditioning, allowing him to turn a potentially disruptive injury absence into a seamless return. Against a depleted Portland roster, his shooting gravity could swing the game early, with highlight-reel threes and quick scoring runs once again defining the Warriors’ night.","Stephen Curry has been cleared to play against the Portland Trail Blazers.

What’s at Stake Against Los Angeles

status looms large over the Phoenix Suns’ December 15, 2025 showdown with the Los Angeles Lakers, with thedue to a lingering right groin strain. The designation marks a meaningful step forward after Booker spent the past three games on the sidelines, and it has injected cautious optimism into a matchup already dripping with Pacific Division tension.Phoenix has reason to hope. Booker was upgraded from out and logged a full practice on Saturday, a strong signal that his recovery is tracking in the right direction. Still, the Suns are expected to wait until closer to tip-off before making a final call, leaving fans, coaches, and the Lakers guessing until the last moment.Devin Booker’s questionable tag reflects progress rather than certainty. While full practice participation is encouraging, groin injuries often demand careful management, especially for a high-usage scorer whose game relies on explosive movement and sharp changes of direction. The Suns know his availability could dramatically swing this matchup, as Booker’s offensive gravity reshapes Phoenix’s spacing and late-game options.If Devin Booker is cleared, he would return just two weeks after initially suffering the injury, an aggressive but not unprecedented timeline given his recent on-court work.Devin Booker first tweaked his right groin on December 1 during a win over the Lakers, exiting early after scoring 11 points and never returning.Since then, he has missed three consecutive games, forcing Phoenix Suns to lean on depth pieces and improvised rotations.Role players such as Collin Gillespie and Grayson Allen were asked to shoulder extra scoring responsibility, delivering gritty minutes but lacking Booker’s shot-creation punch. Teammate Ryan Dunn highlighted Booker’s influence even while sidelined, pointing to his sharp practice sessions and steady presence around the team as he eased back into rhythm without pushing too far, too fast.Phoenix Suns enters the matchup with several rotation questions beyond Booker, underscoring how fragile their margin for error has become.• Devin Booker (SG): Questionable, right groin strain - trending toward a possible return• Dillon Brooks (SF): Questionable, left Achilles soreness - a new concern following a tough shooting outing against Oklahoma City• Jalen Green (SG): Out, right hamstring strain - not expected back before December 18• Isaiah Livers (SF): Out, right hip strain - also sidelined until at least December 18Bradley Beal carries no major injury designation in the latest reports and is positioned to serve as a primary offensive anchor if Booker is unable to go.Sitting around 14-11, the Suns badly need stability after recent turbulence, including a humbling NBA Cup loss. Booker’s typical 25-plus points per night could be the difference between regaining momentum and slipping further in a crowded Western Conference race.Also read: Is Luka Doncic playing tonight vs the Phoenix Suns? Latest update on the Los Angeles Lakers star's injury report (December 14, 2025) For the Lakers, a road win in the desert would sting even more if Phoenix welcomes its franchise scorer back.

What Will Decide the Game

night’s showdown against the Phoenix Suns, carrying no injury designation on the official NBA report for the December 14, 2025 matchup at PHX Arena. With the Lakers listed as 17–7 favorites despite a thinned rotation, all eyes turn to Doncic as Los Angeles looks to assert control in a heated Western Conference clash.The Suns, however, are far from a passive opponent. Phoenix enters desperate to flip the script after dropping an earlier meeting to LA by a 125–108 margin, and the home crowd in the desert will be primed for a statement performance. Doncic’s MVP-level production, 35.0 points, 9.0 rebounds, and 9.0 assists per game, sets the tone for what could be a high-octane, emotionally charged contest.This matchup features the fourth-seeded Lakers against the seventh-seeded Suns, two teams navigating turbulence following recent NBA Cup disappointments. Los Angeles is coming off a frustrating loss to San Antonio, a game that saw Luka Doncic pour in 35 points but still walk away empty-handed as defensive lapses proved costly.Phoenix, meanwhile, sees this contest as a chance to regain footing during a demanding home stretch. Tip-off is set for around 8:00 PM ET, and the narrative is clear: can the Lakers stabilize behind their stars, or will the Suns capitalize on LA’s short-handed rotation?Los Angeles Lakers will be without key contributors, placing added responsibility on its superstar duo.Austin Reaves is sidelined with a left calf strain after logging heavy minutes, while Maxi Kleber remains out with a lumbar muscle strain. Bronny James is unavailable due to his G League assignment. The silver lining: LeBron James is fully available, setting up a Doncic–LeBron pairing to absorb the offensive burden.Phoenix’s backcourt outlook remains uncertain. Devin Booker is listed as questionable with a right groin strain, a potential swing factor if he’s unable to suit up. Dillon Brooks also carries a questionable tag due to left Achilles soreness. Jalen Green and Isaiah Livers are both ruled out, thinning the Suns’ rotation further.Luka Doncic’s step-back shooting against Phoenix’s aggressive defensive schemes could define the night, especially with Reaves out and usage funneling toward Luka. JJ Redick is expected to tighten rotations after the Spurs loss, while Suns coach Jordan Ottle will lean heavily on home intensity and depth contributions.If Booker is limited or unavailable, the edge tilts toward Los Angeles but in a rivalry fueled by pride and playoff positioning, expect a tight finish with star power deciding the final minutes.",Luka Doncic is cleared and ready to go for Sunday’s Los Angeles Lakers vs. Phoenix Suns clash.

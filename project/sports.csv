Bangladesh seek T20 WC match shift from India after Mustafizur Rahman's IPL exit

Poll Do you think Bangladesh's security concerns for the T20 World Cup are valid? Yes, absolutely. No, they are overreacting.





NEW DELHI: Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) president Aminul Islam said the board will decide its next course of action only after receiving a response from the International Cricket Council (ICC), following Bangladesh’s formal request to move their T20 World Cup matches out of India citing security concerns.The BCB wrote to the ICC after Bangladesh’s premier left-arm pacer Mustafizur Rahman was released from the Kolkata Knight Riders squad ahead of the Indian Premier League , a move made under the directive of the Board of Control for Cricket in India ( BCCI ).“You know that we, along with all the directors of the cricket board, held two meetings before taking this decision and at this moment we do not feel secure sending our team to India to play the World Cup,” Aminul told reporters on Monday.Explaining the process, he added, “So we wrote a letter to the ICC, and in the letter we clearly stated what we wanted to say. Because to us, security appeared to be a major concern and that is what we are following. We have sent an email to the ICC and we are expecting them to tell us to have a meeting with them soon where we will express our concern.”Aminul stressed that the BCB’s next move hinges entirely on the ICC’s response.“But what our next step will be depends on the reply to the email we have sent. We do not know what feedback will come (from ICC), but the clauses we have given are within the MPO. We are not communicating with BCCI because this is an ICC event. We are communicating with the ICC,” he said.Amid the standoff, speculation has grown that India may be reluctant to tour Bangladesh for their scheduled white-ball series in September. However, Aminul dismissed any link between bilateral cricket and the current issue. “Look, cricket between the two countries (relationship between India and Bangladesh), like playing a bilateral series or playing in the World Cup, is one thing and security concern is another matter,” he said. “So for now, we are thinking about the World Cup issue (security).”Meanwhile, a day after the BCB’s request, Bangladesh’s Ministry of Information and Broadcasting ordered broadcasters to stop airing the IPL. Aminul maintained it was a sovereign decision. “This is India's domestic cricket, and in domestic cricket, whom to show or not to show is the decision of our government… we have nothing to say. However, it is true that we support the decision taken by the government,” he said.",Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) president Aminul Islam said the board will decide its next course of action only after receiving a response from the International Cricket Council.

The Indian Street Premier League is back, and Season 3 is shaping up to be the biggest yet. From January 9 to February 6, the Lalbhai Contractor Stadium in Surat will once again become the heartbeat of tennis-ball cricket, hosting a tournament that has quickly carved out its own space in India’s crowded cricketing calendar.What sets this season apart is not just the scale, but the ambition. A prize pool of ₹6 crore underlines how far the league has come, while the promise of a brand-new Porsche 911 for the Most Valuable Player adds a layer of glamour rarely seen in this format. In a fast-paced T10 competition where every ball matters, bowlers are expected to play a defining role, using skill, nerve and precision to swing matches in a matter of minutes.Defending champions Majhi Mumbai return with confidence, knowing every opponent will be chasing them. They will be tested from the very first match, with a marquee opening clash against Srinagar Ke Veer setting the tone for the season. Joining them in the title race are Tiigers of Kolkata, Chennai Singams, Bengaluru Strikers, Falcon Risers Hyderabad, Delhi Superheros and Ahmedabad Lions, making for a fiercely competitive lineup.Among the bowlers expected to leave a mark, Abhishek Kumar Dalhor stands tall. The Majhi Mumbai pacer was the backbone of their title run last season and earned the Best Bowler award for his efforts. Calm under pressure and relentless in execution, Dalhor’s journey from ISPL debutant to IPL net bowler with Kolkata Knight Riders speaks volumes about his growth. With 33 wickets across two seasons, he remains the standard others are measured against.Bengaluru Strikers will pin their hopes on Rajendra Singh, whose rise has been one of the league’s most compelling stories. From a development bowler in Season 1 to the most expensive bowler in ISPL auction history, his journey reflects both hard work and belief. Hailing from a small village in Rajasthan, Rajendra now steps into Season 3 knowing expectations are high and eyes will follow every spell he bowls.Chennai Singams have placed their trust in experience and leadership by naming Ankur Singh as captain. A proven match-winner, Ankur was central to Majhi Mumbai’s title win last season and finished as the second-highest wicket-taker. His ability to influence games in crunch moments, whether with ball or bat, makes him a natural leader in a format that leaves little room for hesitation.Srinagar Ke Veer bring a refreshing youth angle through 16-year-old Rudra Patil. Still in Class 11, Rudra represents the spirit of the ISPL, where raw talent meets opportunity. Trained at Shivaji Park under Pravin Amre, the young pacer has shown remarkable confidence against senior players. His story, rooted in family support and fearless ambition, adds an emotional layer to Srinagar’s campaign.Completing the list is Anurag Sarshar of Chennai Singams, a bowler whose value has doubled in a year. Trusted in high-pressure situations, Anurag’s calm at the death made him one of the most reliable performers last season. His retention reflects Chennai’s belief that quiet consistency can be just as valuable as headline-grabbing pace.With tickets starting at ₹99 on BookMyShow and live coverage on Star Sports Network and JioHotstar, ISPL Season 3 promises packed stands and widespread attention. As the league grows, so do the stories it creates, and this season, it may well be the bowlers who write the most memorable chapters.","The Indian Street Premier League is back for its third season. Majhi Mumbai, Chennai Singams, Bengaluru Strikers, Falcon Risers Hyderabad, Delhi Superheros and Ahmedabad Lions will compete.

'Not playing to survive': Joe Root defends Smith's approach after poor dismissal in fifth Ashes Test,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/ashes/not-playing-to-survive-joe-root-defends-smiths-approach-after-poor-dismissal-in-fifth-ashes-test/articleshow/126356002.cms,"Joe Root of England walks off after he was dismissed by Michael Neser of Australia during day two of the Fifth Test in the 2025/26 Ashes Series at Sydney Cricket Ground on January 05, 2026 in Sydney, Australia. (Photo/Getty Images)





England batter Joe Root defended teammate Jamie Smith after his dismissal in the first innings of the final Test in Sydney, saying a batter’s role is to score runs and not just stay at the crease. Root said England were trying to add runs quickly before the second new ball was taken.Jamie Smith’s Ashes campaign continued to be difficult as he fell four runs short of a second half-century in the series. He was dismissed after getting a start, with a commentator describing the shot as ""brainless"".Smith backed away to hit a shoulder-high short ball over the off side but found Scott Boland at deep cover. He was dismissed by part-time pacer Marnus Labuschagne for 46 off 76 balls. The new ball was taken five to six overs after his dismissal.Root said the plan was to make the most of the overs before the new ball.""It was completely different that second new ball, and it was almost maximising that 10-over period ahead of facing that new ball,” Root told reporters after the end of play.""You eke out an extra 20 runs that could be the difference later on down the line. So there was a method behind what we were trying to do.We are always trying to move the game forward. It was not necessarily a case of saying, 'Right, we are going to try and go at 15 an over for the next phase. But you see an opportunity, and you back yourself to make the right decisions,"" he added.Root said batters will make mistakes and need to learn from them without being too harsh or too relaxed.“With what he has achieved in his career to date, I am sure he will find a way of getting in that frame of mind next time he goes out and plays. When it does not come off, it can look a certain way, but you are never playing to get out. As a batter, your job is not to survive; it is to score runs. You cannot win games just by surviving. You have to score more runs than the opposition. It is making sure you have a good method in how you want to achieve that,” Root said.Smith has scored 185 runs in five Tests in the series at an average of 23.12 and a strike rate of 74. He has one fifty in nine innings, with a best score of 60.Root also spoke about vice-captain Harry Brook, who missed out on a maiden Ashes hundred in Australia. He said Brook should take confidence from his innings.“Brooky played exceptionally well, and it was a vital partnership for us to play in that manner,” Root said. “I hope he gains a huge amount of confidence from that, not look back at with regret. It could be a vital innings in the context of this game,” he added.Brook is the third-highest run-scorer in the series with 316 runs from five matches at an average of 39.50 and a strike rate of over 81. He has one fifty.England resumed day two at 211 for 3, with Root on 72 not out and Brook on 78 not out. Brook was dismissed for 84 off 97 balls, which included six fours and a six. Root went on to score 160 off 242 balls with 15 fours. England also received support from Smith, who made 46, and Will Jacks, who scored 27 off 62 balls. England were bowled out for 384 in 97.3 overs.Michael Neser was the leading wicket-taker for Australia with figures of 4 for 60. Mitchell Starc and Scott Boland took two wickets each.At the end of day two, Australia were 166 for 2. Travis Head was unbeaten on 91 off 87 balls, which included 15 fours.

Bangladesh seek T20 WC match shift from India after Mustafizur Rahman's IPL exit





On this day ten years ago, a quiet patch of ground in a Mumbai suburb became the centre of the cricketing world. There were no grandstands, no roaring crowds, and no television history attached to it. Yet on 5 January 2016, it witnessed an innings that school cricket had never seen before.Pranav Dhanawade was fifteen. He opened the batting for Smt KC Gandhi School in a two-day inter-school match for the HT Bhandari Cup. By the time his team declared, he had scored 1009 not out off 327 balls. It was the first time anyone had crossed four figures in a recognised school match. A 117-year-old record was gone. Arthur Collins’ 628 from 1899 was history.The numbers still feel unreal a decade later. One thousand and nine runs. One hundred and twenty-nine fours. Fifty-nine sixes. A strike rate of 308.56. He spent 396 minutes at the crease, batting for over six and a half hours across two days. His team finished on 1465 for 3. Pranav alone had scored close to seventy per cent of the total.Pranav started cautiously. At lunch on the first day, he was on 45. By stumps, he had raced to 652 not out.Somewhere during that long evening, phones began ringing in the Dhanawade household. Friends and relatives called to say records were falling. By the time he walked off, he had already gone past Prithvi Shaw’s Indian school record of 546 and Arthur Collins’ mark that had stood for more than a century.Tuesday morning arrived with a new target in mind. One thousand. Reporters started turning up. Curious locals leaned against the fence. By lunch, Pranav was on 921. After the break, he crossed four figures. There was no celebration that matched the moment, just a young boy raising his bat on a dusty field as cameras scrambled for space.“I wanted to score big runs,” he later told The Indian Express. “I remember my coach telling me that no one will take me in the Mumbai team if I score these hundreds and two-hundreds.”When he went out to bat, the plan was simple. “When I go to bat, I only keep in mind that I had to play a big innings,” he told the BBC. “After playing on and on, I scored 100 runs, 200, 300, 400 runs.”There was luck along the way. A few catches were dropped. A stumping chance went begging. The boundaries were short and the opposition inexperienced. None of that takes away the stamina it required to stay there, ball after ball, session after session.The umpire noticed it. “I would say he was 101% fit temperamentally, and even after scoring so much, he was not tired,” Sunimal Sen told ESPNcricinfo. “Many times we see that batsmen, after scoring a hundred, say ‘Sir, we want water’, but he did not create this type of disturbance.”By the end of the match, Arya Gurukul were bowled out for 56 in their second innings. Smt KC Gandhi School won by an innings and 1382 runs. The result barely mattered anymore.Pranav’s father, Prashant, drives an autorickshaw around Kalyan. On the first day, a friend called him mid-shift. “Your son has 300 and won’t stop,” he said. Prashant rushed to the ground, watched another flood of runs, then returned the next morning with Pranav’s mother, Mohini, to see the moment everyone was waiting for.By Tuesday evening, the narrow lanes around Wayale Nagar were blocked by television vans. Prashant and Mohini gave interview after interview, barely catching their breath. Their son was being spoken about across the world.The Guardian called him “the first cricketer to navigate the nervous 990s”. Sachin Tendulkar posted on social media, congratulating him and urging him to work hard and “scale new peaks”. Ajinkya Rahane sent a message. MS Dhoni spoke about the importance of guidance. “To score like that anywhere, at that age, is very difficult,” he said. “The limelight will be on him, and it is important for his coach and parents to guide him right.”Michael Atherton mentioned the innings during a Test match broadcast. Maharashtra’s sports minister announced support for his education and coaching. Comparisons followed quickly. Too quickly, perhaps.Mumbai has always produced prodigies. Tendulkar and Vinod Kambli once put on 664 runs together as teenagers. Sarfaraz Khan scored 439 at twelve. Prithvi Shaw made 546 at fourteen. Pranav’s 1009 joined that list, louder and larger than all before it.Years later, the story sounded different. Pranav, now in his mid twenties, spoke about inconsistency, missed selections, and the weight of expectation. The pandemic took away opportunities. Others from his age group moved ahead. He was still chasing a place.“The expectation was huge after the record,” he admitted. “Every time I walked out to bat, I felt the pressure,” he told Cricket Graph.Yet the meaning of that day has not faded. On this day ten years ago, a boy from a modest family stood at a crease and refused to get out. For two days, cricket stopped being about levels and pathways and became something simpler. Bat. Ball. Time. A reminder that sometimes, history chooses the most unexpected corners to announce itself.","Pranav Dhanawade scored 1009 not out off 327 balls.

‘Navgire extremely hard to stop when she gets going’

‘Excited to work with

Shikha Pandey

’





NAVI MUMBAI: It’s not easy to be the head coach of teams in both the Women’s Premier League (WPL) and the Indian Premier League (IPL). Former India and Mumbai allrounder Abhishek Nayar, in charge of both the UP Warriorz in the WPL and Kolkata Knight Riders in the IPL, is the first to do so. However, when it comes to the WPL, the former India assistant coach has found a simple way to ease his ‘workload.’Explaining why he chose to name Meg Lanning as the captain of UP Warriorz for WPL-4 during his team’s pre-season presser on Monday, Nayar termed the Australian legend, who thrice led the Delhi Capitals to the WPL final, as “the best mind out there in women’s cricket.”“For me, she is the best mind out there in women's cricket. So we are very happy to have her. I think something that was very important when we tried to form this squad was to get the best captain out there and someone who could lead this group. It was a very, very easy and obvious choice for us. Having Meg there makes things easier for me,” Nayar said.The Mumbaikar quipped that it’s Lanning who will “take all the pressure while he will be chilling, having coffee.”“Yes, it's the first time for me (as a women’s team coach), yes.But I've always believed the best teams have the best captains. And this format, especially, is a captain's format. So I wanted someone who could lead this team. And having Meg there makes things very easy for me because she's going to take all the pressure. I'm going to be chilling, having coffee. So no pressure. I'm very excited,” Nayar said.The WPL stint is of course, a new start for Nayar. “It's a new journey for me in women's cricket. But nothing changes. It's still cricket. It's still about the players. It's not about the coach. So I'm here to support her and the team in the best way possible. And hopefully, we can create a legacy of our own,” he said.Lanning, as a player, won two ICC Women’s Cricket World Cups and five ICC Women’s T20 World Cup titles. As captain, she led Australia to T20 titles in 2014, 2018, 2020 and 2023 and one ODI World Cup crown in 2022.One of the most consistent performers in WPL too, Lanning has amassed 952 runs in 27 matches, forming a hugely successful opening partnership with Shafali Verma at Delhi Capitals.Geared up for the new challenge, Lanning, who was bought by UPW for Rs 1.9 cr at the WPL auction, said, “I’m very excited to join UP Warriors and to be able to work with Abhishek and the group. I think we've assembled a really nice squad. We've got some really good balance there with experienced players. We've also got Deepti (Sharma) and Harleen (Deol) coming in, who will provide us with some good experience and depth there, and then some good, younger players as well. The team did a great job in putting the list together. We've covered a lot of different bases, and now we just get the opportunity to go out there and play and express ourselves and have some fun.”Lanning is excited to work with UPW’s young guns, India pacer Kranti Goud and explosive batter Kiran Navgire, who smashed the fastest-ever century (off 33 balls) for Maharashtra against Punjab. “I have seen her from the other side the last few years and it looks like she is extremely hard to stop when she gets going. The fact that it has been an excellent domestic season for her so far is great, coming with a lot of confidence and often cricket is based a lot around confidence so I am really excited to see what she can do for us this year,” Lanning said.“I am super excited to see what Kranti she has got and I will be backing her to be able to execute and do well,” she added.Having played the past three seasons of the WPL, Lanning has a fair idea about how the standard of Indian women’s cricket has improved over the years-India’s historic, maiden triumph in the Women’s ODI World Cup last year being a reflection of that. India’s players are now making significant contributions in their teams’ WPL wins.“I think the biggest thing that I have seen is just the depth and the amount of Indian players who are able to contribute and win games for their teams. Probably in the early part of the tournament, it was probably reliant on the internationals a fair bit and the big Indian players. Whereas now you have got contributions from a number of different people and they are putting pressure on the big stars which is really good to see. So, that has been one of the biggest points is that you have got so many more players now who can perform at the level required,” Lanning said.She felt that the WPL had “exposed India’s players to high-pressure situations.” “So that creates some really good depth for Indian cricket and we have obviously seen that with the success at the World Cup. So that is probably one of the things. The other thing is just exposing more players to high pressure situations. That is what the WPL has done. There is a lot of eyes watching every game and there is a lot of increased media attention and things like that. So the more you do that the more you get used to it and the better you get. I think we have seen that throughout the three tournaments that everyone is getting used to that a little bit more and thriving under those conditions,” Lanning explained.Having played for Australia from 2010-23, Lanning was naturally upset at Australia’s stunning defeat to Australia in the 2025 Women’s ODI World Cup semifinals? Did it even prompt the 33-year-old to male a comeback?“Obviously, I still know a fair few people in the team as well. I would have loved for them to be able to win that game and win the World Cup. That is the nature of elite sport. There are so many good teams out there now. That is just because everyone is developing. We have got programmes and tournaments in place that allow people to play better and keep developing their skills. It creates a good challenge for Australia to keep improving and work out how we can win more World Cups. Ultimately, that is what you want to do,” Laning said.“It is great for the game, I think. It has obviously been difficult to watch. I would have loved Australia to win. That is the way it goes. We will try and win the next one,” she said.Apart from Kanti, Lanning is confident in the abilities of her other prominent Indian fast bowler, veteran pacer Shikha Pandey. “I am really excited to work with Shikha again. I thoroughly enjoyed playing alongside her previously and she is just very experienced. She knows her game really well. She knows what her strengths are and what her different options are as well and very cool and calm under pressure and often in this format you are under the pump a lot as a bowler so I think she provides that for our team. I think she will be able to lead our pace bowling attack and provide some real good guidance for those bowlers there and help me in that role as well. She has shown that she is a proven performer across the whole innings,” Lanning said.“She can open the bowling, she can bowl through the middle and she can finish at the death. As a captain to have someone like that in your team, that just makes my job a little bit easier…I’m looking forward to another great season from Shikha,” she added.",Abhishek Nayar named Meg Lanning as the captain of UP Warriorz for WPL-4. Former India and Mumbai allrounder Nayar is in charge of both the WPL and Kolkata Knight Riders in the IPL.

Sam Curran press conference: Sam hails Desert Vipers’ consistency after historic ILT20 title win





Australia’s Marnus Labuschagne was at the heart of the action on Day 2 of the fifth Ashes Test in Sydney, making his impact felt both with the bat and the ball while also briefly clashing with England captain Ben Stokes late on Monday.During a tense moment just before stumps, Labuschagne appeared to rile Stokes while he was batting, prompting a fiery exchange on the field. But the Australian’s attempt to get under the English captain’s skin ultimately counted for little as Stokes had the final say, dismissing Labuschagne for 48 in the first innings. The 68-ball knock played a crucial role in Australia’s response, although he fell just short of a half-century.Asked about the on-field confrontation during the post-day press conference, Michael Neser was dismissive, saying, “Not a clue…” He went on to highlight Labuschagne’s competitive temperament, adding, “It's just the fact that he's such a strong competitor that he can get under your skin. It's just Marnus for you.”Labuschagne’s contributions with the ball were equally notable. Earlier in the day, he removed England’s Jamie Smith, who was well set on 46.Smith attempted an aggressive shot against a short delivery from Labuschagne and found a fielder on the boundary just before lunch. Neser explained that Labuschagne’s bowling is no accident, noting, “It's not like it's just a fluke. He's actually practiced it. The one thing about Marnus is his quicker ball is actually quite a lot quicker – he was in the 130s (kph) and then he can bowl anywhere from 112 to 130, so it's quite hard to get a read on him when he's going like that. ”Labuschagne’s ability to contribute with the ball is not new to his teammates. Neser said, “He loves bowling. We've seen it in Sheffield Shield cricket. It's not a surprise to us because he's actually done that role quite often in Shield cricket and got a fair few wickets bowling short.” His part-time spin and seam options provide Australia with valuable flexibility in the middle overs, adding depth to a batting-heavy line-up.England were bowled out for 384 in their first innings, leaving Australia with a manageable target to build momentum. By the close of play on Day 2, Australia had reached 166 for 2, with Travis Head leading the reply in impressive fashion. Head remained unbeaten on 91 from 87 balls, while Michael Neser held the other end at 1 not out, leaving Australia in a strong position as they looked ahead to the next day’s play.Labuschagne’s performance, both in frustrating Stokes and taking key wickets, reinforced his status as a pivotal all-round contributor for Australia in the Ashes series. His competitive edge, ability with the ball, and disciplined batting are proving crucial as the contest heads into the final stages.","Marnus Labuschagne was at the heart of the action on Day 2 of the fifth Ashes Test in Sydney. The Australia batsman was dismissed for 48 in the first innings. Earlier in the day he removed England’s Jamie Smith, who was well set on 46.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126353783,imgsize-140476,width-400,resizemode-4/australia-v-england-202526-ashes-series-fifth-test-day-2.jpg"

MANCHESTER: Ruben Amorim's sacking by Manchester United has exposed the dismal lack of progress since Jim Ratcliffe's arrival as co-owner promised a new dawn.Amorim was the latest manager unable to turn the tide at Old Trafford, which has witnessed more than a decade of decline since Alex Ferguson retired in 2013.The veteran Scot stood down after winning the club's 20th English league crown following two decades of domestic dominance gilded by European success.Since then United have not seriously competed to win the Premier League or Champions League despite a succession of big-name managers.Amorim, 40, is the first boss to be hired and axed since Ratcliffe took control of the club's football operations after acquiring a minority stake in the Red Devils.The British billionaire's arrival in February 2024 was greeted with glee by supporters desperate to see a new face at the helm after years of underachievement under the Glazer family, who still own a majority stake.Yet hopes that the boyhood United fan could make United competitive again at home and in Europe have so far been dashed.- No 'knee-jerk reactions' -Just a few months ago, Ratcliffe, 73, said Amorim had three years to prove himself despite a tough start at United, adding that the club would not be drawn into ""knee-jerk reactions"".But United have continued to drift, winning just one of their past five home games in the league.An apparent rift with the club's director of football Jason Wilcox over tactics and transfer targets appears to have increased the pressure on Amorim, who was dismissed on Monday after 14 months in charge.Wilcox moved into his current position in June last year, taking over the main role held by Dan Ashworth, who lasted just five months at the club in an early embarrassment for the new regime.Ratcliffe has so far done little to suggest he can deliver on his desire to restore a club he admitted ""has become mediocre"" to former glories.The club's ambition to win a 21st league title by the time of their 150th anniversary in 2028 looks less realistic with every passing season.United finished the 2024/25 campaign in 15th spot -- the club's lowest top-flight finish since they were relegated in 1974 -- and missed out on European football for only the second time in 35 years.Despite a marginal improvement this season, Amorim departed with his side 17 points adrift of leaders Arsenal after 20 games.The club are still within striking distance of the top four but cannot afford to lose further ground.- Transfer flops -Ratcliffe has been publicly scathing of some of United's transfer dealings prior to his arrival but the jury is still out on incomings on his watch.Joshua Zirkzee and Manuel Ugarte have largely been peripheral figures since being signed under the managerial regime of Erik ten Hag, Amorim's predecessor.Amorim was armed with an expensive new front three of Benjamin Sesko, Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo in the recent summer transfer window but they have scored just 12 Premier League goals between them so far.United's ability to spend their way out of their troubles is beginning to be squeezed by financial sustainability rules.The club's desperate need to return to the lucrative Champions League will have been a factor in their decision to axe Amorim, who arrived in November 2024 feted as one of the game's leading young managerial talents.To compound matters for United fans starved of success, Ratcliffe is asking them to pay more to attend games.At the same time, he has been criticised for swingeing job cuts as he tries to restore order to the club's finances.Last year United set out plans for a 100,000-seater stadium to replace their historic but creaking Old Trafford ground.Ratcliffe said the club planned to have the ""world's greatest football stadium"", with hopes it could be finished within five years, though there is major uncertainty over the timescale.Plans on and off the pitch are undoubtedly ambitious, but they are a long way from being realised.",Amorim is the first boss to be hired and axed since Jim Ratcliffe took control of the club's football operations. The British billionaire's arrival in February 2024 was greeted with glee by supporters desperate to see a new face at the helm after years of underachievement.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126358490,imgsize-79020,width-400,resizemode-4/mnh-49.jpg"
No more 3-4-3 as Manchester United sack head coach Ruben Amorim after Leeds draw; here's why,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/top-stories/no-more-3-4-3-manchester-united-sack-head-coach-ruben-amorim-heres-why/articleshow/126351096.cms,"Ruben Amorim





Manchester United on Monday sacked head coach Ruben Amorim, hours after the Portuguese spoke about tensions within the club following Sunday’s 1-1 draw against Leeds United. Amorim had said the club hierarchy needed to ""do their job"" and that he should be allowed to work without interference.The 1-1 draw at Elland Road was Amorim’s final match of his 14-month spell in charge. The result left Manchester United sixth in the Premier League after 20 matches.“With Manchester United sitting sixth in the Premier League, the club’s leadership has reluctantly made the decision that it is the right time to make a change,” United said in a statement. “This will give the team the best opportunity of the highest possible Premier League finish.”Former midfielder and current Under-18s coach Darren Fletcher is expected to take charge on an interim basis. His first match is likely to be away at Burnley on Wednesday night. The club is expected to make a permanent appointment in the summer.Reports had claimed that United’s head of recruitment, Christopher Vivell, asked Amorim to adapt his tactics after Fulham manager Marco Silva explained how his team planned to counter United’s system during their draw in August.Amorim changed his usual three-man defence for the win over Newcastle but returned to his preferred system in draws against Wolves and Leeds.Amorim was appointed in November 2024 after Erik ten Hag was sacked. The decision to remove him was taken by the club’s leadership, including chief executive Omar Berrada and director of football Jason Wilcox, following a breakdown in relations.Under the terms of his contract, which runs until 2027 with an option for a further year, United will have to pay the full amount, as there is no clause for a reduced exit.After the Leeds match, Amorim said, ""It’s going to be like this for 18 months or when the board decide to change. That was my point, I want to finish with that. I’m not going to quit. I will do my job until another guy is coming here to replace me.""Amorim had faced criticism for sticking to a 3-4-3 formation. Before the Leeds game, he spoke about differences over the system and difficulties in signing players suited to it. He again used the 3-4-3 against Leeds.",Manchester United sack head coach Ruben Amorim. The Portuguese had spoken about tensions within the club.

Under the supervision of a court-appointed committee, a tender was issued for the ISL’s commercial rights, but it did not attract any bidders.On Thursday, 13 of the 14 ISL clubs informed the AIFF that they ""may be ready and willing"" to participate in the delayed season if there is no participation fee and if the federation takes responsibility for organisational and operational costs of a shortened tournament.Meanwhile, the AIFF said on Saturday that the start date of the delayed ISL season will be announced next week after the Coordination Committee submitted its report.Following a meeting of its Emergency Committee, the AIFF said it will conduct the league, though clubs had raised concerns earlier.News agency PTI reported that that the AIFF may propose February 15 as the start date for the 2025-26 ISL season.""The AIFF Emergency Committee met today (January 3, 2025) to consider and acknowledge the report submitted by the AIFF-ISL Coordination Committee.

Arsenal fought back from a goal down to beat Bournemouth 3-2 on Saturday, stretching their lead at the top of the Premier League as Aston Villa extended their winning run at home. A goal from Gabriel Magalhaes and two from the returning Declan Rice sent the Gunners six points clear of second-placed Villa and seven ahead of Manchester City.Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta praised the character of his team, singling out Rice and Gabriel, whose sloppy pass set up Bournemouth for the opening goal.""I love the character of Gabriel, the way he overcome that situation -- it's just unbelievable, it says a lot about how much we've grown,"" he told Sky Sports.""The team found a way to beat them and it's a massive win.""The Spaniard said that Rice had worked hard to be available after missing Tuesday's 4-1 home win against Villa with a knee problem.""He has stretched himself to the very limit and the team were awarded with two great goals,"" he added.Evanilson gave impressive Bournemouth an early lead, stroking home after Gabriel's error but the Brazil defender made up for his mistake just minutes later, converting after Noni Madueke's drive to the byline.England midfielder Rice side-footed the Gunners ahead in the 54th minute from the edge of the area and gave them breathing space with about 20 minutes to go, producing a low finish from substitute Bukayo Saka's cutback.Junior Kroupi brought Bournemouth back into the game with a thunderous right-footed finish but Arsenal held on for a fifth straight Premier League win -- keeping them firmly on course for a first English title since 2004.Earlier, Unai Emery's Villa bounced back from their chastening defeat at Arsenal to beat Nottingham Forest 3-1, recording their 11th consecutive home win in all competitions.England forward Ollie Watkins gave Villa a deserved lead on the cusp of half-time with a powerful strike from just outside the area and John McGinn scored twice in the second half, either side of a Morgan Gibbs-White goal.Villa boss Emery said his players and coaching staff had held a meeting after their drubbing at the Emirates Stadium.""I am so happy,"" he said. ""We had to recover our energy and our confidence. Here, at Villa Park, the energy we create was really important.""Forest are competitive.

""It's about actions.

India’s top footballers have come together to make an emotional appeal to FIFA, asking the world governing body to step in as the Indian Super League (ISL) remains suspended with no clear return date. The appeal includes senior Indian players like Sunil Chhetri , Gurpreet Singh Sandhu and Sandhesh Jhingan, along with several foreign players who play in the ISL.The players said the continued delay of the 2025–26 ISL season has created deep uncertainty and fear. They warned that Indian football is slowly moving towards a complete standstill if the situation is not resolved soon.""It's January and we should be on your screens as apart of a competitive football game in the Indian Super League,” Gurpreet said in a joint video shared on social media.""Instead, here we are driven by fear and desperation to say aloud something which we all know,"" Jhingan added.In the video, the players said that the All India Football Federation (AIFF) is no longer able to manage the crisis and protect the future of football in the country. They asked FIFA to intervene and help bring stability back to the game.""But more importantly, we are here to make a plea. Indian football governance is no longer able to fulfil its responsibilities. We are now staring at a permanent paralysis. This is the last-ditch effort to save what we can.So we are calling the FIFA to step in and do what it takes to save Indian football,"" the players said.They also made it clear that their message was not political but based on urgent need.""We hope this message gets to the power that are in Zurich. This call is not political, it is not driven by confrontation but by necessity. It might sound like a big word but the truth is that we are facing a humanitarian, sporting and economic crisis. And of course, we need rescuing at the earliest. We just want to play football, please help us do it,” they said.Sunil Chhetri ended the appeal by stressing the impact on everyone involved. ""Players, staff, owners and the fans deserve clarity, protection and more importantly, a future,” he added.The ISL season was put on hold in July due to uncertainty over the renewal of the Master Rights Agreement between the AIFF and Football Sports Development Limited (FSDL). The deal expired in December, leading to legal issues and Supreme Court involvement. A fresh tender for ISL’s commercial rights also failed to attract bidders.With the season still delayed, clubs are worried about finances and player contracts. Thirteen of the fourteen ISL clubs have told the AIFF they may play if there is no participation fee and the federation covers operational costs.The delay also threatens clubs’ chances of qualifying for the AFC Champions League 2, as they may not meet the minimum match requirement.",India's top footballers have come together to make an emotional appeal to FIFA.

Poll Should Pep Guardiola consider a change in tactics after the frustrating draw? Yes, definitely No, the current tactics will work Only minor adjustments are needed





Manchester City missed the chance to keep pace with Arsenal at the top of the Premier League after being held to a frustrating 0-0 draw by Sunderland on Thursday, as a low-scoring start to 2026 saw three of four New Year’s Day fixtures end without a goal.City now trail league leaders Arsenal by four points after failing to capitalise on the Gunners’ emphatic 4-1 demolition of Aston Villa earlier in the week. Pep Guardiola’s side had won eight straight matches to close out 2025, but were unable to break down a resilient Sunderland team that preserved its unbeaten home record since returning to the top flight.Bernardo Silva thought he had given City an early lead, only for his effort to be ruled out for offside inside the opening six minutes. Despite Sunderland missing six players to the Africa Cup of Nations and centre-back Dan Ballard through injury, the hosts held firm. Goalkeeper Robin Roefs produced a string of fine saves to deny Erling Haaland and Josko Gvardiol, while Savinho blazed over a gilt-edged chance.“It’s a mystery,” Guardiola said. “We created a lot, especially in the second half. We take the point — it’s a long way to go.”Liverpool were also left frustrated after being held to a 0-0 draw by Leeds at Anfield.Reds boss Arne Slot lamented the absence of “individual special moments” as his side struggled without Mohamed Salah and Alexander Isak. Leeds thought they had snatched a late winner through Dominic Calvert-Lewin, but his effort was ruled out for a marginal offside, extending their unbeaten run to six games.Tottenham’s attacking woes continued in another goalless draw away to Brentford on Thomas Frank’s return to the club he once guided into the Premier League. Spurs fans vented their frustration late on, chanting “boring, boring Tottenham,” while Frank admitted, “We don’t create enough. We need to keep working on that.”Elsewhere, Crystal Palace’s winless run stretched to six games after a 1-1 draw with Fulham. Jean-Philippe Mateta opened the scoring before Tom Cairney struck a fine equaliser.","Manchester City were held to a frustrating 0-0 draw by Sunderland.

Why Deion Sanders’ name keeps surfacing in Browns coaching talk despite Cleveland’s reported doubts,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/why-deion-sanders-name-keeps-surfacing-in-browns-coaching-talk-despite-clevelands-reported-doubts/articleshow/126363838.cms,"Browns coaching search sparks Deion Sanders buzz (Imagn Images)

Deion Sanders and the Browns’ complicated equation







Deion Sanders does not need an invitation to dominate the conversation. His name alone carries weight, and in Cleveland, weight turns into noise fast. The Browns did not just fire a head coach. They reopened an old wound that fans know too well. Instability. When Kevin Stefanski was let go, the move felt less like an ending and more like another reset for a franchise still searching for its true identity. That vacuum is where speculation thrives, and Sanders naturally stepped into it.The timing only sharpened the intrigue. Cleveland has a young quarterback with a famous last name, a restless fan base, and ownership that has never shied away from bold decisions. Add those pieces together and the idea almost sells itself. Almost. Because behind the flash and headlines sits a far more uncomfortable truth about control, commitment, and whether the Browns are ready to tie their future to one family-driven vision.At first glance, Deion Sanders looks like a shortcut to relevance. He has rebuilt Colorado’s image, commands instant respect, and understands how to lead under pressure.Yet the Browns’ hesitation has less to do with his résumé and more to do with the ripple effects of hiring him. Bringing Sanders to Cleveland would not be just a coaching decision. It would be a declaration.That reality was laid bare by Chris Broussard while discussing Stefanski’s dismissal. “I think [Stefanski’s] handling of Shedeur is what doomed him,” Chris Broussard of Fox Sports 1 said on Monday, January 5. “If you hire Deion, you’re committing to Shedeur. And he has not shown me enough to know he’s my next franchise guy.”Those words explain why Cleveland may never seriously pursue Sanders. The Browns want options. Hiring Deion would narrow them instantly. It would signal complete belief in Shedeur Sanders as the long-term quarterback, something the front office may not be ready to do after one uneven season.Deion Sanders stayed publicly silent on the firing, but his social media post added fuel to the moment. “We’re gonna make it!” Deion Sanders wrote. “Please get that in your Heart, your Spirit & your way of Living! It’s 2026 & that means it’s a New Year therefore it’s time for New Things! A whole new mindset is warranted & must be established right Now! We’re gonna Win this Game of Life. #CoachPrime.” The message appeared less than an hour after Cleveland moved on, and its themes felt impossible to ignore.Still, Sanders’ focus remains in Boulder, where he is rebuilding a program and protecting the culture he created. Cleveland offers fame and pressure, but also risk. For now, the Browns’ interest feels more like fascination than intent, and Deion Sanders appears far more invested in finishing what he started.Also Read: Tom Brady’s first major move with Raiders revealed as head coach search begins post–Pete Carroll debacle",Cleveland Browns fired head coach Kevin Stefanski on Monday.

Tom Brady’s influence could define the Raiders’ next era







Tom Brady has stepped into a role the Las Vegas Raiders hope finally brings stability to a franchise stuck in constant reset mode. After another lost season and another coaching change, the Raiders are turning to one of football’s sharpest minds to help reshape their future. Brady, now a minority owner, is no longer a distant figure in the background. His influence will be felt at the most critical decision point for the organization.The move comes after Las Vegas dismissed Pete Carroll following a brutal 3–14 campaign that exposed deep flaws in leadership, roster balance, and direction. Expectations were high when Carroll arrived with championship credentials, but optimism faded quickly as losses piled up. With fans restless and patience thin, ownership made a decisive call that signaled urgency rather than comfort with the status quo.Raiders owner Mark Davis made the plan clear in his official announcement. ""Moving forward, General Manager John Spytek will lead all football operations in close collaboration with Tom Brady, including the search for the club’s next head coach,"" Davis said in a statement on Monday.""Together, they will guide football decisions with a shared focus on leadership, culture, and alignment with the organization’s long-term vision and goals,"" Davis’ statement concluded.Brady’s presence adds credibility to a search that carries enormous weight. This will be the fourth head coach hired since 2022, and the margin for error is gone. The Raiders are not just filling a vacancy. They are choosing an identity. Brady’s championship background offers insight into what sustainable success looks like, from locker room tone to weekly preparation.His partnership with Spytek is not built on theory. The two share history from their time around Michigan and later in Tampa Bay, where Spytek worked in the front office during Brady’s final NFL years. That familiarity could speed up decisions and reduce the kind of misalignment that has haunted previous regimes.The timing matters. Las Vegas owns the No. 1 overall pick in the 2026 NFL Draft, a rare opportunity that could alter the franchise for the next decade. Indiana quarterback Fernando Mendoza is already viewed by many as a potential cornerstone, but a young quarterback needs the right coach to thrive. Getting that hire wrong would waste both talent and time.Several teams are competing for top coaching candidates this offseason, increasing the pressure on the Raiders to present a clear vision. Brady’s involvement sends a message that Las Vegas is serious about doing things differently. After years of false starts, the Raiders are betting that the greatest winner the sport has known can help them finally choose right.Also Read: Who are Tom Brady's parents?

“It’s been a stressful time”: Travis Kelce’s guarded reaction hints at a deeply personal gift from his fiancé Taylor Swift,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/its-been-a-stressful-time-travis-kelces-guarded-reaction-hints-at-a-deeply-personal-gift-from-his-fianc-taylor-swift/articleshow/126351805.cms,"Travis Kelce said his favorite Christmas gift came from Taylor Swift but chose not to reveal what it was, sparking widespread curiosity.

Taylor Swift Travis Kelce Christmas gift signals a shift toward privacy





Taylor Swift Travis Kelce Christmas gift rumors did not begin with a flashy reveal or a carefully planned headline. They started with a pause. During a recent New Heights podcast episode, Travis Kelce casually admitted that his favorite Christmas gift came from Taylor Swift . Then he stopped himself. His reason was simple and telling: “It gives away things that we’re trying to keep in house.” That restraint instantly shifted the moment from playful to serious.Taylor Swift Travis Kelce Christmas gift chatter took off because Kelce is rarely vague. His silence suggested something personal, not performative. Fans quickly sensed the gift was less about celebration and more about protection. Privacy has become rare currency for the couple, especially as their engagement and future plans draw constant attention from fans and media alike.Speculation ran in every direction until insiders offered a striking claim. According to Closer Online UK, Swift may have purchased a private island near the Bahamas. The source explained, “They’ve always wanted somewhere with complete privacy, and Taylor’s been searching for a few months.” For two people whose lives unfold under stadium lights and camera flashes, the idea of total isolation feels intentional, not indulgent.The reported gift reflects where Swift and Kelce are right now. Wedding plans are underway. Careers remain demanding. Quiet moments are scarce. Insiders added context to the decision, saying, “With all the wedding planning and their hectic schedules, it’s been a stressful time. They’re looking forward to what may be their last Christmas, just the two of them – as they’re keen to start a family soon after the wedding. ”That detail reframes everything. This is not about luxury for its own sake. It is about creating space before life changes again. The rumored island represents calm, control, and a future built away from noise.Swift and Kelce confirmed their engagement on Aug. 26, 2025, with Swift writing, “Your English teacher and your gym teacher are getting married 🧨”. Since then, they have shared joy without oversharing. Whether the island exists or not, the message is clear. Their focus is no longer on spectacle. It is on building something lasting, quietly, and on their own terms.Also Read: Taylor Swift is reportedly choosing a wedding dress that mirrors her relationship with Travis Kelce","Travis Kelce said his favorite Christmas gift came from Taylor Swift but chose not to reveal what it was, sparking widespread curiosity.

TJ Watt's return has become more than a football headline. It has turned into a personal moment that blended grit, family, and quiet resilience inside the Watt household.Sunday night carried extra weight as the Pittsburgh Steelers lined up against the Baltimore Ravens. The stakes were high, the kickoff late, and the emotions even heavier. For Dani Watt, the night was not just about standings or playoff hopes. It was about watching her husband step back onto the field after weeks of uncertainty, pain, and recovery, while balancing the exhaustion of new motherhood.Dani Watt made her feelings clear through a candid glimpse into her game-day reality. Sharing a photo of her coffee cup on Instagram Stories, she joked about the late kickoff, writing, “This mama is tired. Been up since 3:20am 😅.” The message struck a chord with fans who saw a familiar mix of fatigue and determination behind the humor. Motherhood, long nights, and football Sundays had collided, yet her support never wavered.As the night unfolded, Dani’s pride shone brighter than her fatigue. In a follow-up post, she reminded everyone that commitment does not clock out early. Wearing a black and yellow Steelers t-shirt, she shared a video and wrote, “But we rally baby because 90 is BACK! 💛.”The short line carried the weight of weeks spent worrying, waiting, and believing.TJ Watt’s road back was far from routine. On Dec. 11, he was hospitalized after experiencing lung discomfort during practice. His brother, JJ Watt, later explained that the issue stemmed from a dry needling session at the team facility. JJ shared the update on X, stating, “Yesterday TJ had successful surgery to stabilize and repair a partially collapsed lung suffered Wednesday after a dry needling treatment session at the facility. ” He added, “Recovery timeline is still TBD, but all went well and he is being released from the hospital today. He and his family are very appreciative of everyone’s kind words and well wishes.”Dani echoed that gratitude in her own update, writing, “Yesterday TJ completed successful surgery to stabilize and repair a partially collapsed lung suffered early Wednesday after a dry needling treatment session at the facility.

At 42 and on a one-year deal, he admitted retirement remains uncertain and confirmed he will discuss his next move with his wife, Brittani. Though rarely seen publicly, she plays a key role in his decision-making beyond the season.

Aaron Rodgers wife Brittani shapes his next NFL move





Aaron Rodgers' wife Brittani has quietly become one of the most influential figures in the final chapter of the Steelers quarterback’s career, even though fans still know almost nothing about her. With Pittsburgh heading into a win-or-go-home Week 18 clash against the Ravens, the spotlight is firmly on Aaron Rodgers. At 42, he is staring down a moment that feels bigger than one game.Rodgers has spent the season proving he still belongs. He led the Steelers to nine wins on a one-year deal and steadied a locker room that needed belief. Now, with retirement questions growing louder, he has made it clear that football is no longer a solo decision.Rodgers recently acknowledged that his future will be discussed at home before it is decided publicly. Speaking honestly about what comes next, he told reporters:""I'm thinking about this week, but obviously I'm 42 years old and I'm on a one-year deal. Whenever the season ends, I'll be a free agent. So that'll give me a lot of options if I still want to play. I mean, not a lot of options, but there'll be options, I would think, maybe one or two, if I decide I still want to play.""That conversation, he confirmed, will include his wife. Rodgers has kept Brittani almost entirely out of the public eye, which only adds to the intrigue. No photos. No public appearances. No sideline moments. Yet her presence looms large as Rodgers weighs whether to chase one more season or finally step away.He later drew a firm line around how much he plans to share, saying: ""I don't really want to get too deep into it, you know? Obviously, I'll talk to my wife and then, you know, hopefully that's a decision down the line, but I'm not really going to talk about anything.""For now, Rodgers insists his attention is locked on Sunday night. Still, the message is clear. His legacy may be decided on the field, but his future will be decided at home.Also Read: “She didn’t sign up to be a celebrity”: Aaron Rodgers says his wife ‘deserves the right’ to live outside the public eye","Aaron Rodgers' wife Brittani has quietly become one of the most influential figures in the final chapter of the Steelers quarterback’s career.

Chloe Kim watched history unfold as Myles Garrett etched his name into the NFL record books on a tense Sunday night in Cleveland. The Browns’ defensive star delivered a season that refused to be ignored, and when the final whistle blew after a 20-18 win over the Bengals, celebration followed in the most personal way possible.The moment did not arrive with fireworks or speeches. Instead, it came quietly through a phone screen, where pride and affection met achievement. Garrett had just recorded his 23rd sack of the season, a number that lifted him above legends and placed him alone at the top. For Kim, the milestone called for something warmer, something homemade, something human.Soon after the game, Kim shared a snapshot that said more than statistics ever could. Over a photo of Garrett smiling while holding a plate, she wrote, “Proud of you!!!” The image featured a cinnamon roll, and Kim added, “Baking u all the cinnamon rolls your heart desires!!” with a heart emoji. The simplicity of the message matched the sincerity behind it. She later reposted a Browns graphic marking the record, punctuating the moment with a string of exclamation points.Garrett’s achievement carried weight beyond one game. His 23rd sack surpassed the 22.5 mark set by Michael Strahan in 2001 and later matched by T.J.Watt in 2021. It also reinforced a rare level of consistency. He is now the first player in league history to post at least 12 sacks in six straight seasons and the only one with double digit sacks across eight consecutive years.Speaking after the game, Garrett reflected on the milestone with calm confidence. He said the moment was “everything I expected” and that the “feeling couldn’t be better.” He credited preparation, belief, and the teammates around him for making it possible.Linked publicly since May 2025, the pair made their first red carpet appearance at the Crunchyroll Anime Awards in Japan and later confirmed their relationship during a sideline moment in Las Vegas. As Garrett prepares for his future in Cleveland after signing a four-year, $160 million extension, Kim has her own history within reach. The two-time Olympic gold medalist is aiming for Milan in 2026, chasing a third straight halfpipe title.Records may define legacies, but moments like this reveal the people behind them.Also Read: Travis Kelce drops hint on retirement timeline after Chiefs wrap up season with loss: “Either it hits me quick or …”","Chloe Kim celebrated Myles Garrett's NFL sack record with a heartfelt message.

Critics questioned the optics and impact on the program as UNC finished a disappointing 4–8 season. The controversy intensified due to the couple’s age gap and Belichick’s silence, fueling concerns about leadership, image, and focus within the university’s football program.

Jordon Hudson’s message reignites backlash around Bill Belichick





The Bill Belichick era at North Carolina was supposed to be about control, discipline, and football purity. Instead, as 2025 closed, attention drifted far from playbooks and practice fields. A short social media post from Jordon Hudson, Belichick’s girlfriend, pulled the program back into the spotlight for all the wrong reasons and reignited an already simmering debate around optics, age gaps, and leadership.The reaction was swift and loud. Fans, alumni, and even voices tied to the university questioned why the conversation around a storied football hire keeps circling back to personal matters. With North Carolina coming off a disappointing season, patience appears thin and scrutiny intense.Hudson, 24, closed out the year with an Instagram message that many critics viewed as provocative rather than reassuring. In the post, she addressed the public attention surrounding her relationship with the 73-year-old coach, writing, “Nothing changed for us in 2024 except for 'public knowledge' yet everything changed.” She followed that with, “4th calendar year. Going strong. I can't wait to take punches for you in 2026.” The caption also included the line, “Cheers to our 3rd midnights' kiss.”Those words struck a nerve. Online backlash quickly followed, with some arguing the post blurred personal expression and institutional responsibility. According to a Yahoo Sports report, concerns reached beyond social media and into academic circles, where questions surfaced about how the university’s image is being managed.One particularly sharp criticism summed up the mood. “When you agreed to pay a king's ransom to hire Bill Belichick, did you also know that you were hiring Jordon Hudson as the primary face of UNC athletics?” the message read, before adding, “Please end this circus.”Belichick, long known for his tight-lipped approach during more than two decades in the NFL, has not publicly responded. On the field, his first college season ended at 4 and 8, an underwhelming result given his reported $10 million annual salary.For now, the silence continues. But with results lagging and controversy growing louder, North Carolina finds itself wrestling with a narrative it never planned to manage.Also Read: “Something was dying in me”: Cardi B opens up about emotional burnout amid Stefon Diggs’ legal controversy",Jordon Hudson’s year-end Instagram post reignited backlash around her relationship with North Carolina head coach Bill Belichick.

Brittany Mahomes highlights strong bond with Patrick Mahomes’ mom





The Mahomes household closed out a difficult NFL season with a moment that had nothing to do with football and everything to do with family. As Patrick Mahomes recovers from a season ending ACL injury, the focus inside his inner circle has quietly shifted from wins and losses to support, gratitude, and togetherness. That shift became visible through a simple exchange on social media that fans quickly noticed.Brittany Mahomes has never shied away from showing loyalty to the people closest to her husband. This time, her words carried extra weight. With the Chiefs missing the playoffs and Patrick facing a long road back, Brittany’s public praise for his mother offered a glimpse into how the family is leaning on one another during an unexpected pause in his career.Ahead of the New Year, Randi Mahomes shared a holiday post reflecting on what mattered most after a challenging season. Alongside family photos featuring Patrick, Brittany, and the couple’s three children, she wrote, “Christmas with my family will always be my greatest gift. This Grandi’s heart is full!” The images showed Sterling Skye, Bronze, and Golden Raye enjoying quiet moments with their grandmother, far removed from stadium noise and game day pressure.Brittany’s response stood out immediately. In the comments, she summed up her feelings with a short but meaningful line, calling Randi the “Best Grandi Ever.” The remark may have been brief, but it spoke volumes about the relationship between the two women who play central roles in Patrick Mahomes’ life.The timing made the moment resonate even more. Patrick’s injury marked the end of a season filled with frustration for Kansas City, including their first missed postseason since 2014. Yet the Mahomes family chose to highlight stability instead of disappointment.Brittany and Randi have always been united in good and bad times, when it comes to celebrating titles and going through rough times. Their recent interaction supports the fact that football does not form the basis of the family.With Patrick concentrating on rehabilitation and the Chiefs looking forward towards the offseason fans can anticipate more glimpses of that strong bond. For now, the message is clear. The Mahomes family is focusing on connecting, being positive, and being there even in a rough year.Also Read: Brittany Mahomes shares glimpse of her New Year as Patrick Mahomes continues grinding through rehab","Brittany Mahomes publicly showed appreciation for Patrick Mahomes’ mother, Randi Mahomes, after a challenging Chiefs season.

Alix Earle’s dad makes Tom Brady nod with a viral blazer joke





Alix Earle’s dad makes Tom Brady nod after their St Barts party video went viral, and he is clearly enjoying the moment rather than running from it. While the internet buzzed with theories and side eye glances, Thomas “TJ” Earle chose humor as his response. The attention followed a New Year’s Eve sighting in St. Barts that placed his daughter, influencer Alix Earle, next to former NFL star Tom Brady in a clip that spread fast and fueled curiosity.Instead of issuing clarifications or dodging the chatter, TJ leaned into the joke at home. The moment unfolded casually, without scripts or polish, which only made it land harder. In a culture that often takes celebrity rumors too seriously, his reaction felt grounded and refreshingly human. It also reminded fans that not every viral moment needs a dramatic explanation.The St. Barts video showed Alix and Brady chatting, dancing, and sharing light physical closeness. Online speculation quickly followed, as it often does when two high profile figures appear together. Yet those close to the situation urged restraint, pointing out that public proximity does not always signal romance. The noise grew loud, but TJ’s lighthearted comment shifted the tone entirely.The humor surfaced in a TikTok posted by TJ’s wife, Ashley Earle, as she prepared for an evening out wearing a blue velvet blazer that once belonged to him. In the background, TJ casually revealed why the jacket caught his eye in the first place.“I actually got that jacket because I saw Tom Brady wearing one like that,” TJ said in the Saturday, January 3, clip, as per Us Magazine.Ashley, clearly amused, pressed him on the comment. “Are you joking?” she asked. TJ doubled down with, “I swear to God.” Her response landed with playful disbelief. “Are you serious? … You know what, honey, you just say the darnedest things. How ironic is that?” She later assured viewers she would not be “cutting” the exchange from her video, a choice that only amplified the laughs.While fans enjoyed the joke, sources moved quickly to cool dating rumors. One insider stressed that Alix and Brady “aren’t dating,” adding that “if they hang out again, it would be a fling at best.” Another clarification followed soon after. It is not that the 48 year old athlete “isn’t interested, it’s just too soon for anything more than a fun hangout.”In the end, TJ’s response may have done more to shape public perception than any formal statement. By laughing along, he reminded everyone that sometimes a viral moment is just that, a moment.Also Read: ""New beginnings"": Alix Earle breaks silence in her own way after being spotted with Tom Brady during buzzworthy New Year’s Eve","Thomas “TJ’ Earle chose humor as his response to dating rumors.

He said the university is conducting a cultural review alongside a legal probe. Manuel acknowledged the personal difficulty of the decision but said Moore’s dismissal was professionally necessary given Michigan’s standards and expectations.

Michigan AD addresses Sherrone Moore firing and investigation





Michigan’s football program entered a turbulent chapter this winter, and now its top athletic leader is addressing the fallout head-on. Athletic director Warde Manuel spoke publicly for the first time since the firing of head coach Sherrone Moore, pushing back against speculation while confirming that a broader review of the department is underway. His remarks offered clarity, restraint, and a clear signal that the university is bracing for uncomfortable truths.Manuel’s comments arrived as legal and cultural questions continue to swirl around the program. With an external investigation active and criminal charges filed against Moore, Michigan faces scrutiny well beyond the football field. Manuel acknowledged the strain on the community while drawing a firm line between personal empathy and professional responsibility.Speaking to reporters on December 28, Manuel made it clear that not everything circulating publicly is accurate. “There’s not much I can say,” he said. “There’s an investigation continuing into Coach Moore — there’s a cultural evaluation around the department — and so we will we obviously know some facts. There’s some things that are out there that I can’t comment on, that are untrue, and there may be some things that they find, but that’s why we do an investigation, and I’m very open to that.The University of Michigan has enlisted Chicago-based law firm Jenner and Block to examine the athletics department, with Moore’s conduct a central focus. Manuel said he personally requested additional oversight.“I asked the President to help with a cultural analysis and have somebody come in,” he explained. “So yes, I am very supportive of that, because as a leader, I face reality. There are things that happen. I don’t step away from it. Never have, never will.”Moore was fired on December 10 following an internal investigation that uncovered evidence of an inappropriate relationship with a female staff member. Later that day, he was arrested and charged with felony home invasion and misdemeanor offenses, including stalking. He was released on bond and is scheduled to return to court on January 22.Despite describing the situation as emotionally difficult, Manuel said the decision itself was straightforward. “Professionally, it was an easy decision to make because of the expectations that we have for everyone on our side.”Michigan has since moved forward, naming former Utah coach Kyle Whittingham as Moore’s replacement. In a statement, Manuel praised Whittingham as “a leader of exceptional character,” emphasizing discipline, respect, and accountability as the foundation for the program’s next era.Also Read: Sherrone Moore scandal deepens as five women come forward with detailed accounts of troubling interactions",Michigan athletic director Warde Manuel addressed Sherrone Moore’s firing for the first time.

While none of the rumored relationships have been confirmed, the speculation continues to follow him. Sources say Brady remains focused on his children and career, appearing in no rush to settle into a serious relationship.

Tom Brady’s rumored celebrity links since his divorce





Tom Brady’s post-divorce dating life has quietly turned into one of the most watched celebrity storylines in sports and pop culture. Since ending his marriage with Gisele Bündchen in 2022, the seven-time Super Bowl champion has stepped into a far looser chapter of life. Public sightings, party whispers, and casual run-ins have followed him from yachts to weddings, even as he avoids confirming any serious relationship.What makes the attention sharper is Brady’s contrast. On the field, his career thrived on structure and discipline. Off it, his personal life now feels fluid and undefined. While Bündchen has remarried and welcomed a child, Brady appears comfortable staying unattached. Those close to him say he remains focused on work and his children, letting speculation swirl without response.Over the past three years, Brady has been linked to several high-profile women from different worlds. Each rumor tells less about commitment and more about timing, access, and curiosity. The pattern suggests someone enjoying freedom rather than searching for permanence.The most recent buzz involved TikTok star Alix Earle after videos showed the two together during a New Year’s celebration in St.Barths. Earle later described the trip as “New friends, new beginnings”, leaving fans guessing about the nature of their connection.Supermodel Irina Shayk remains Brady’s most consistent link. First seen together in 2023, the pair reportedly reconnected again later, with insiders labeling it a “situationship”, suggesting a relaxed bond without pressure or labels.Sports Illustrated model Brooks Nader surfaced in rumors during summer 2024, though sources insisted their time together was never meant to be serious. Actress Sydney Sweeney entered the conversation briefly after they attended the same Venice wedding, but her camp quickly dismissed any romantic angle.Sofía Vergara and Brady also sparked chatter after being photographed together on a luxury yacht. Vergara later spoke about wanting a partner with “basics”, though she never tied that comment to Brady. Even Kim Kardashian was loosely linked after a viral photo at a Hamptons party, a rumor later brushed aside as friendly.Also Read: “I’m grateful for…”: Gisele Bündchen opens up on motherhood, healing, and life beyond Tom Brady","Tom Brady has been linked to several high-profile women since his divorce from Gisele Bündchen in 2022.

5. Mike Brown – New York Knicks ($10 Million)



4. Doc Rivers – Milwaukee Bucks ($11 Million)



3. Tyronn Lue – Los Angeles Clippers ($15 Million)



2. Erik Spoelstra – Miami Heat ($15 Million)



1. Steve Kerr – Golden State Warriors ($17.5 Million)







For a long time, NBA head coaches were often an afterthought in the league's grand financial landscape. While players saw their contracts skyrocket into the hundreds of millions, the person standing on the sidelines usually earned a fraction of that, despite being the one responsible for keeping the locker room together and making split-second tactical decisions. However, the tide has turned.The franchise owners have understood that investing in good guidance will breed a top-tier team. With team valuations hitting record highs and the pressure to win rings becoming more intense than ever, the market for elite leadership has exploded. This is an era where the best minds in the game are finally seeing paychecks that match their massive influence on the court.Mike Brown, in July 2025, signed as a Knicks’ head coach with a $40 million, four-year contract that’ll pay him $10 million annually. The Knicks are currently third in the East with a 23-23 record and a .639% percentage.Brown is known for his defensive mind and high-energy approach, and brings with him four NBA championship experiences as an assistant coach. The fact that $10 million is now the entry price for a top-tier coach shows just how much the market has shifted. For the Knicks, paying this price is a small investment if it means finally bringing sustained success back to the Big Apple.Sham Charania, back in January 2024, shared that Doc Rivers signed an extension contract with the Bucks worth $40 million through the 2026-27 season. Rivers remains one of the most recognizable voices in the league, and this $11 million per year is all justified by the veteran experience he brings in. He is currently registering a win percentage of .444% with the Bucks, who have won 12 of the 36 games so far in this season.Tyronn Lue boasts a record of 262-209 with a winning percentage of .556%. As per Sprotrac, Lue signed a 5-year, $70 million extension contract with the Clippers in the summer of 2024. And has earned every penny of his $15 million annual salary by being the ultimate problem-solver for the franchise, who dealt with constant injuries and roster shifts. He is widely respected for his honesty and fearless game adjustments. LA Clippers’ owner Steve Ballmer is known for spending big to win, and keeping Lue in the fold was clearly a top priority to ensure the team has a steady hand at the wheel.The Miami Heat showed their commitment to Erik Spoelstra with a monster eight-year deal worth $120 million in 2024. According to ESPN, this is the most money ever committed to in North American History. Under this contract, Spoelstra is set to earn an average of $15 million annually.He’s often called a coaching wizard because of his ability to turn even an average-looking roster into an Eastern Conference powerhouse. This salary is an appreciation for the 2 NBA titles that the Heat franchise has won under him in 6 finals appearances.Steve Kerr stands alone at the top of the mountain. After coaching the Warriors through one of the most dominant runs in sports history, he secured an extension that pays him a staggering $17.5 million annually, making him the highest-paid coach in NBA.Kerr signed in early 2024, signed a 2-year, $35 million extension contract, keeping him with the Warriors through the 2025-26 season. By the end of this NBA edition, a new discussion is pending. This salary isn't just for his wins and losses, but it’s a reward for the rare ability to manage the players and keep them grounded, so the only visible goal they have is the championship.Also read: From hoops to hollywood: NBA players who appeared on the silver screen and stole the spotlight","NBA head coaches were often an afterthought in the league's grand financial landscape.

2. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar – Airplane! (1980)

The intersection of professional basketball and Hollywood has long been a fascination for fans, serving as a bridge between high-stakes athleticism and cinematic storytelling. While many athletes falter with the shift from hardwood to red carpet, some figures exchanged their jerseys for something entirely new, and they made it memorable.From the neon-soaked aesthetics of the 90s to the high-tension dramas of the modern era, NBA players have used the silver screen to expand their personal brands and showcase surprising emotional depth. These performances offer more than just star power, they provide a unique cultural synergy where the gravity of sports meets the imagination of film.In this movie, Michael Jordan played a version of himself who has to save the Looney Tunes who were kidnapped by aliens to be showcased as new attractions at an amusement park. The movie is a replication of Jordan’s real life, where he left NBA to play baseball. This movie shows him rediscovering his love for basketball. It was during the climax that Jordan realised the perks of the cartoon world and delivered a game-winning dunk.How? He literally over–stretched his arm mid-air to deliver the dunk against the hulking Monstars. With this victory, the hero finally saved everyone and regained his old love for the game.Kareem Abdul-Jabbar’s role in this slapstick masterpiece is a masterclass in deadpan comedy. Playing Roger Murdock, a commercial co-pilot, he spends the first half of his screen time insisting he is not the Lakers' center. However, the facade breaks when a child passenger criticizes his hustle on the court. Kareem snaps, grabbing the kid by the collar and venting about the grueling nature of the NBA schedule and the physical toll of dragging Walton and Lanier up and down the court for 48 minutes. This combination of using an athlete’s real-life reputation with his comedic timing on the silver screen remains one of the most effective ways to create something timeless.As Jesus Shuttlesworth, Ray Allen didn't just play a basketball player, he carried the emotional weight of a Spike Lee joint. The film’s narrative tension peaks during a one-on-one game between Jesus and his estranged father, Jake (Denzel Washington), on a dark, urban court. With the stakes being: if Jake wins, Jesus signs with a specific college to shorten Jake’s prison sentence. Allen’s performance is hauntingly quiet, capturing the internal struggle of a young man who must decide whether to forgive the man who killed his mother while navigating the high-pressure collegiate basketball.In Uncut Gems, Kevin Garnett plays a fictionalised version of himself who is convinced that a rare Ethiopian Black Opal with mystical power fuels his performance on the court. The film uses real footage from the 2012 Celtics-76ers playoff series, weaving Garnett’s character into the plot as he bargains with Howard Ratner (Adam Sandler) to keep the gem. His portrayal of an athlete’s superstitious obsession is so convincing that it serves as the driving engine for the film's tragic finale.Shaquille O'Neal played Neon Bodeaux, a raw, towering talent from the Louisiana bayou who is illegally recruited by Coach Pete Bell (Nick Nolte). The movie highlights Shaq’s physical dominance through the game sequences where he literally shatters backboards- something that the NBA has seen in real life. Shaq’s role serves as the moral center of the film's corruption arc, where Neon’s innocence and pure desire to play are mistreated by the highly pressuring and demanding collegiate basketball, where talent is respected, and rest is disregarded.Also read: LeBron James breaks yet another historic record in Lakers’ win over Grizzlies","From the neon-soaked aesthetics of the 90s to the high-tension dramas of the modern era, NBA players have used the silver screen to expand their personal brands.

Knicks owner James Dolan reveals his sights are on the NBA Championship



James Dolan reveals why the Knicks fired Tom Thibodeau







James Dolan rarely speaks publicly. In his first wide-ranging media appearance since January 2023, the Knicks owner made it clear that recent success has not altered the organization’s long-term goal. Winning matters, but only in one form. Anything short of an NBA championship does not move the needle at Madison Square Garden.Speaking on WFAN’s “The Carton Show,” Dolan addressed the growing conversation around the Knicks’ NBA Cup victory in Las Vegas. The team celebrated the win alongside their fans. However, Dolan reveals that he is looking for the taste of the real thing and that is without a doubt, the NBA Championship.James Dolan, who has a whopping $2 billion fortune, confirmed the Knicks will raise a banner at Madison Square Garden, but not for the NBA Cup. His words left no room for misinterpretation.“We are going to raise the banner. We’re going to raise the NBA championship banner. That’s the banner we want to raise,” he said on WFAN. “We want an NBA championship, we don’t want some consolation prize.”The Knicks captured the NBA Cup with a narrow win over the Spurs, a moment Dolan acknowledged as valuable for evaluation rather than celebration.He described the tournament as a chance to test the team under pressure and measure how it might perform later in the season.“I was very proud of the guys. They did a great job and we’re proud to have the Emirates Cup, but we’re going to hang a championship banner, a real banner.”Dolan also expressed confidence in the current roster, pushing back on speculation about major trades. He praised the locker room dynamic and emphasized continuity.“We love our team. I’ve never seen more copacetic locker room,” he said. “This group could win a championship. I believe it.”Dolan also addressed the decision to part ways with Tom Thibodeau after the team’s deep playoff run. His explanation focused on direction rather than results.“The team is really built on the shoulders of Tom Thibodeau. He built that core,” Dolan said. “But we did come to the conclusion that we had an idea of how we wanted to organize the team.”Dolan explained the shift centered on leadership style and long-term development. Modern NBA success, he noted, depends on collaboration, internal growth, and adaptability.“If you want to build a long-term, competitive, compete for the … you need somebody who's more of a collaborator than Tom was,” he said. Still, Dolan made sure to credit Thibodeau’s impact.“Tom is still a great coach. He should coach again in the NBA.”Dolan’s latest interview has revealed lucid inside details of the franchise that is chasing the Championship.Also Read: Kobe Bryant's wife Vanessa Bryant says friends kept pushing her forward long after Los Angeles Lakers legacy froze time","Knicks owner James Dolan spoke on WFAN's ""The Carton Show"" Dolan said the team will raise a banner at Madison Square Garden, but not for the NBA Cup.

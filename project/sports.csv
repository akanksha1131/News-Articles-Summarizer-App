After their spiritual interaction, Kohli also visited several initiatives run by the ashram and paid his respects at the nearby hermitage of Gaurangi Sharan Maharaj, the spiritual mentor of Premanand Ji Maharaj.This was Kohli’s third visit to the ashram — he had previously come on January 10, 2024, and January 4, 2023.Kohli’s Test retirement marks the end of an era.

Barcelona win 28th La Liga title after beating Espanyol,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/top-stories/barcelona-win-28th-la-liga-title-after-beating-espanyol/articleshow/121199484.cms,"Getty Images

- Yamal breaks through -

A stunning Lamine Yamal strike helped crown Barcelona La Liga champions with a 2-0 win at local rivals Espanyol on Thursday, with victory ensuring Real Madrid cannot catch them at the top of the table. Yamal's effort and Fermin Lopez's goal took Hansi Flick's side seven points clear of Los Blancos with two matches remaining, to clinch Barcelona's 28th title and complete a superb domestic treble.Only the Champions League escaped an exciting young Barca side this season, as they won the league for the second time in six years, at Espanyol's ground again just as in 2023.Back then, celebrating Barca players were chased from the field by angry home supporters but this time Espanyol turned on the sprinklers to soak the jubilant visitors, who headed down the tunnel quickly.Yamal opened the scoring after 53 minutes of a tense derby clash with a brilliant curling effort, before Lopez added another in the 95th minute to secure victory.""It's time to celebrate,"" said Barca coach Flick, who said he would demand even more from his team next season.""It's in our DNA (to want to learn), it's normal, and this is what I want from the players, that they always try to get better and they have this hunger, it's crucial.""Outside the stadium before the match several Espanyol fans were hit by a car which drove into a big crowd, although none were seriously injured and police said it appeared to be an accident.Barcelona were seconds away from sealing their title triumph on Wednesday but Real Madrid snatched a 95th-minute winner against Mallorca to delay the inevitable.Flick's side started slowly in Cornella, with Espanyol, 16th, looking dangerous on the counter-attack and keen to secure their top-flight survival.Wojciech Szczesny made a fine save to deny Javi Puado who broke through on goal in Espanyol's best chance of the opening period.Barca dominated the ball but failed to create any clear opportunities themselves in the first half.The Catalan giants have often blown teams away this season, approaching a century of goals in La Liga, but with the title on the line and a hostile crowd against them, they needed something special to break through.That came from 17-year-old wing wizard Yamal, who zipped inside off the right flank and unleashed a rocket into the top corner from outside the box, in a replica of his goal for Spain against France in the Euro 2024 semi-finals.It was the teenager's eighth La Liga strike of the season but with goals in both matches against rivals Real and also in the visit to face Atletico Madrid, he has a penchant for the big occasion.""I don't know what to say about Lamine, he scored an amazing goal, he's had an amazing season,"" said Lopez.Barca's superb display in Sunday's Clasico, in which they beat their rivals 4-3 in a thrilling battle, effectively won them the title.They still had to get it over the line against their neighbours, though, and that became easier when Leandro Cabrera was sent off for an elbow into Yamal's stomach.Even though they had a player fewer, Espanyol pressured Barcelona heavily until Lopez drilled past Joan Garcia to end the hosts' resistance.Espanyol fans pelted Barcelona players with bottles as they celebrated the goal, but as the league's youngest squad wrapped up a title that most believed was unlikely at best after Kylian Mbappe's arrival at last year's champions Real, they did not care.""On the pitch it was clear we could not celebrate there... two years ago (there was trouble),"" Flick told reporters.""It's also about respect for the fans here, (so) of course we celebrated in the dressing room, fantastic, the players could do that, really good.""Tomorrow I will stand a little bit in the background and I also will enjoy it. When I see the people are happy and smiling I will enjoy it.""",Barcelona win La Liga title with 2-0 win at local rivals Espanyol. Goals from Lamine Yamal and Fermin Lopez seal victory. Barca seven points clear of Real Madrid with two matches remaining. Barcelona win domestic treble for second time in six years.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121199529,imgsize-121548,width-400,resizemode-4/Barcelona-1605-Getty.jpg"

Gauff joins Paolini

Jannik Sinner marched into the semi-finals of the Italian Open on Thursday after destroying Casper Ruud in straight sets 6-0, 6-1 as Coco Gauff won a marathon three-set battle with China's Zheng Qinwen to advance to the women's final.American Gauff will face Italy's Jasmine Paolini in Saturday's title match after pulling through 7-6 (7/3), 4-6, 7-6 (7/4) in a match that lasted over three-and-a-half hours.Ruud was supposed to be Sinner's toughest test in Rome since he came back from his three-month doping ban, as the Norwegian came into the match in hot form on clay after winning in Madrid earlier this month.In his previous matches Sinner looked to be still finding his feet after his suspension, accepted from the World Anti-Doping Agency for testing positive for traces of clostebol in March last year.But the 23-year-old demolished sixth seed Ruud in just over an hour with an ominous display of tennis, his domination such that the home fans at the packed centre court, seemingly out of sympathy, began to cheer the rare points that Ruud won.""I was feeling great on court today. I think we all saw that,"" said Sinner.""How I felt today was very, very positive signs for me... I was serving well and also returning well. Moving great on the court, so I'm very happy about that.""Ruud even got the loudest celebration of the match when he held his serve for the only time, in game three of the second set, holding his arms aloft in ironic joy.""He was just everywhere... it's just like playing a wall that you know shoots hundred miles an hour balls at you all the time,"" said a bewildered Ruud.Tommy Paul, a 7-6 (7/4), 6-3 winner over Hubert Hurkacz in the day's first match, will have wondered what on earth he can do to stop Sinner if the Italian brings that form to Friday's last-four clash.Sinner won the first set in just 27 minutes, giving up only seven points as he stalked the court with intent, dressed all in black as he has been all week.And he then maintained his record of not dropping a set in the tournament to not so much stroll as smash into the last four, and send a message to Carlos Alcaraz.Spaniard Alcaraz, Sinner's key Grand Slam rival ahead of the French Open, will contest the other semi-final with Lorenzo Musetti on Friday afternoon, with the blockbuster final tennis fans wanted still on.Gauff prevailed on a centre court left mostly empty by fans who headed for the exits in large numbers after watching Sinner's tennis clinic.Former US Open winner Gauff won her third straight match against Olympic gold medallist Zheng, after coming through a tie in which she made 15 double faults on serve and there were a combined total of 156 unforced errors.The 21-year-old is looking for her first title of the season after losing the Madrid final to Sabalenka, and against home hope Paolini will find herself in a much fiercer atmosphere than the soporific crowd which stayed till past midnight to watch her reach her second final of the year.""I told myself I'm ready to go home,"" said an exhausted Gauff.""It was tough for me, finding my rhythm especially at night, it was so slow, I just tried to stay in there.""I was frustrated. She forced me to get out of my comfort zone.""Sixth seed Paolini is the third Italian woman to reach the Foro Italico final, and the first since her doubles partner Sara Errani was thumped by Serena Williams in 2014.Late bloomer Paolini, 29, will have a chance to be the first woman from the Mediterranean nation to win in Rome since Raffaella Reggi in 1985, after beating Peyton Stearns 7-5, 6-1.""It's a privilege to be in this position. I matured late as a tennis player but everyone has their own path. Some mature earlier and some later,"" said Paolini.""I'm just enjoying it without thinking too much about the past.""Paolini could yet win both the singles and women's doubles tournaments, with her and Errani taking on Mirra Andreeva and Diana Shnaider in the semi-finals on Friday.","Jannik Sinner thrashes Casper Ruud in straight sets 6-0, 6-1. Coco Gauff beats China's Zheng Qinwen to reach women's final. Gauff will face Italy's Jasmine Paolini in Saturday's title match. Tommy Paul beats Hubert Hurkacz in day's first match.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121200918,imgsize-24478,width-400,resizemode-4/Jannik-Sinner-Rome-AP.jpg"

Bombay Sport Exchange Ep 5: Shane Watson on IPL, India-Australia rivalry | Part 1

NEW DELHI: Gujarat Titans currently sit atop the IPL 2025 points table and are training at full intensity ahead of their upcoming clash against Delhi Capitals on Sunday at the Arun Jaitley Stadium in Delhi. With 16 points from 11 matches, the Titans are well-positioned to secure a top-two finish in the league stage. Their remaining fixtures include matches against Delhi Capitals (away, May 18), Lucknow Super Giants (May 22), and Chennai Super Kings (May 25).As part of their preparations, head coach Ashish Nehra actively participated in the team’s fielding drills. Renowned for his sharp one-liners and playful personality, Nehra once again stole the spotlight during the session.With the tournament entering its business end, Gujarat Titans are leaving no stone unturned in their pursuit of playoff dominance — and with Nehra keeping the atmosphere light yet focused, the team appears to be in fine balance both mentally and tactically.“Bahot badhiya darling... Chhaa gaya miyaan aaj... Ek aur lele aaja... Base bana le, base bana le,” Nehra was heard saying in his trademark style, drawing laughter from players and support staff alike.The former India pacer led the fielding session with full commitment, working closely with several players, including all-rounder Shahrukh Khan.With the league stage of IPL 2025 entering its final stretch, the battle for playoff spots has intensified. Gujarat Titans and Royal Challengers Bengaluru currently sit at the top of the table, both with 16 points from 11 matches.Gujarat Titans lead the standings, thanks to a superior Net Run Rate (NRR) of +0.793, while RCB follows closely with an NRR of +0.482.Punjab Kings are hot on their heels with 15 points from 11 games, including one no-result. Their NRR of +0.376 keeps them in strong contention for a top-two finish. Mumbai Indians, despite having played one game more (12 matches), are also in the mix with 14 points and a healthy NRR of +1.156—the best among all teams so far.Delhi Capitals are placed fifth with 13 points from 11 matches. With one no-result and an NRR of +0.362, they are very much in the playoff hunt and could climb further up the table with strong finishes in their remaining games.Kolkata Knight Riders are hanging on to playoff hopes with 11 points from 12 matches. Their NRR of +0.193 may come into play if multiple teams finish with similar points. Lucknow Super Giants, at 10 points from 11 matches and an NRR of -0.469, face an uphill task to break into the top four.Sunrisers Hyderabad, Rajasthan Royals, and Chennai Super Kings have all been eliminated from the playoff race. SRH have 7 points with a poor NRR of -1.192, while RR and CSK share 6 points each but lag behind on NRR, at -0.718 and -0.992 respectively.With only a handful of games remaining, the margins are razor-thin, and every run could decide who makes it to the IPL 2025 playoffs.",Gujarat Titans currently sit atop the IPL 2025 points table with 16 points from 11 matches.

Poll Who do you think has been the best player for Real Madrid in La Liga this season? Vinicius Jr Thibaut Courtois Kylian Mbappe

Real Madrid 's title hopes in La Liga were hanging on by a thread ever since the 4-3 loss to rivals and likely winners Barcelona earlier last week. However, the Los Blancos' title hopes, no matter how small, almost came to a halt after narrowly escaping a draw in La Liga on Thursday. With Carlo Ancelotti's departure confirmed, the Spanish giant's only hope of securing a title is in the rare outcome that Barca fails to win all three of their remaining games in the competition.The defending league champions were up against 9th placed Mallorca at the Santiago Bernabeu, needing a win to sustain any hope of not letting Barcelona win the title. However, things did not start off well for the hosts as they went a goal behind in the first ten minutes. A composed finish from inside the penalty area, placing the ball out of reach for a diving Thibaut Courtois put Real in a precarious spot.Needing at least two goals to get back in the game, the men in white started sending in a flurry of shots from outside the penalty box. However, Mallorca keeper Leo Roman’s 10 saves throughout the game gave Real a difficult time in finding the net.The goals finally came for Real in the second half, when Kylian Mbappe found the net in the 68th minute. The Frenchman wriggled through the Mallorca defence and adeptly found the bottom right corner. With the shift in momentum, Real finally found themselves on the front foot.An impressive second half between the sticks for Roman came undone in what proved to be one of the last kicks of the game, as Real centre-back Jacobo Ramon forced the ball over the Mallorca keeper, winning it at the death. The win means that Real now have 78 points from 36 games, but will see their bitter rivals Barcelona crowned champions if they manage to win their game in hand against Espanyol on Friday.","Real Madrid beat Mallorca 1-0 at the Santiago Bernabeu.

NEW DELHI: In a historic milestone for Indian cricket Ravindra Jadeja has etched his name deeper into the sport’s legacy by maintaining the longest-ever reign as the No. 1 all-rounder in Test cricket history for 1,151 days.The star spinner and dependable lower-order batter continues to stand tall atop the ICC Men’s Test All-Rounder Rankings , an achievement no player before him has managed for such an extended period.Jadeja’s dominance at the top is not just a testament to his consistency but also his unmatched versatility across conditions. Whether it’s a gritty fifty on a crumbling pitch or a match-turning five-wicket haul, the 36-year-old has become a pillar of India's Test side.His reign as the world's best all-rounder underscores the rare balance he brings to the game, something few in cricketing history have achieved.But while Jadeja's place at the top remains unshaken, Bangladesh’s Mehidy Hasan Miraz is quietly making headlines of his own.Following a phenomenal Test series against Zimbabwe, where he scored 116 runs and claimed 15 wickets, Miraz climbed to No. 2 in the all-rounder rankings. His career-best rating of 327 puts him just 73 points behind Jadeja, adding an exciting edge to the next few Test series.The rankings also saw significant movement across the board. Bangladesh's Test win in Chattogram spurred leaps for players like Taijul Islam and Shadman Islam , while England's Joe Root remained the No. 1 batter. Jasprit Bumrah , meanwhile, retained his crown as the world’s top Test bowler.Still, the spotlight firmly belongs to Jadeja. In an era dominated by specialists, his prolonged excellence with both bat and ball has redefined what it means to be a modern all-rounder—and now, he's officially the greatest in that role Test cricket has ever seen.","Ravindra Jadeja has been the No. 1 all-rounder in Test cricket for 1,151 days.

Virat Kohli retires from Test cricket after 14 years

NEW DELHI: Modern-day batting legend Virat Kohli ’s retirement from Test cricket has sparked an outpouring of admiration from across the cricketing world, with former England captains Michael Atherton and Nasser Hussain leading the chorus of praise. After a 14-year journey that reshaped Indian cricket’s approach to the red-ball game, Kohli announced his retirement on Instagram, ending a legendary career with 9,230 runs in 123 Tests, including 30 centuries.""I loved watching him play every day of his 123 Tests,"" Atherton said, speaking to Sky Sports. ""You couldn't take your eyes off Kohli. He put his heart and soul into Test cricket, and that energy and passion never seemed to dim.""Reflecting on Kohli’s retirement note, Atherton said it was significant that Kohli acknowledged the unique challenges of Test cricket — a format he not only embraced but elevated with unmatched intensity.Kohli’s retirement leaves India facing a void at the crucial No. 4 position ahead of their five-Test series in England. ""You kind of pity the person who has to follow,"" Atherton remarked, noting the formidable legacy left behind by Kohli, much like his predecessor, Sachin Tendulkar Nasser Hussain echoed similar sentiments, hailing Kohli as a transformative figure. ""I’ve been a massive Virat Kohli fan over the last 14 years,"" Hussain said on the Sky Sports Cricket podcast. ""But he was so much more than just the stats — it was his aura, swagger, and passion. No one embodied the meaning of cricket in India more than Kohli.""Under Kohli’s leadership, India became the No. 1 Test side in the world, holding that position for a staggering 42 months. With 40 wins in 68 matches as captain, his aggressive style of leadership redefined India’s image in Test cricket — fearless, fiery, and fit.""He is the ultimate winner,"" Hussain added. ""He can’t go on the field and not be 100 per cent. Everything for Kohli is about winning. That’s why he was so good in run chases and why India became such a formidable force.""As Team India prepares for the next World Test Championship cycle, all eyes will be on who steps into Kohli’s shoes. But for now, the cricket world stands united in celebrating a once-in-a-generation player who brought fire and flair to the longest format.","Virat Kohli retires from Test cricket after 14 years.

'Every game a knockout now': Varun Chakaravarthy eyes momentum after KKR’s nail-biting win over RR

The final stretch of the 2025 Indian Premier League ( IPL ) is set to commence on the 17th of May. After a brief suspension following cross-border tensions between India and Pakistan, the premier competition is set to return after a nine day hiatus. As the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) communicated the decision to host the ""remaining League-Stage matches across six venues"", Kolkata's Eden Gardens will have to let go of the privilege of hosting this season's finale.The battle for the coveted trophy has been pushed ahead from 25th May to the 3rd of June. The six venues to be used for the remaining League games are Delhi, Jaipur, Lucknow, Ahmedabad, Mumbai and Bengaluru. As for the playoffs, the venues are yet to be decided. While this does not necessarily mean that no other venue will be considered, an official release by the IPL mentions that all 17 games will be played across the aforementioned arenas.The final was due to be played at the Eden Gardens on May 25 ahead of the competition being suspended. The revised scheduled most likely takes into account potential weather disruptions and other logistical concerns with keeping the playoffs and final in Kolkata.AccuWeather predicts showers and thunderstorms in Kolkata on June 3rd - the day of the final. The early onset of the Southwest monsoon, as per the India Meteorological Department (IMD), will see rains advance to some parts of the Bay of Bengal.Furthermore, Qualifier 2 has also been shifted to another location; it was originally allotted to KKR's home turf. Incidentally, Hyderabad, which was supposed to host Q1 and the eliminator, has also been relieved of its responsibilities.While the venue for the playoffs and final is yet to be announced, reports suggest that the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad has been shortlisted to host Qualifier 2 and the final. As opposed to 65 per cent probability of precipitation at the Kolkata venue, Ahmedabad only stands one-third the likelihood.","The final stretch of the 2025 Indian Premier League ( IPL ) is set to commence on the 17th of May.

RAIN PAIN

Bengaluru: The break in the IPL this season seems to have worked in Rajat Patidar ’s favour. The Royal Challengers Bengaluru captain, who suffered a right ring finger injury against Chennai Super Kings in a home game on May 3, got some time to recover for the remainder of the season, which resumes here on Saturday. With his availability a talking point ahead of RCB’s match against Kolkata Knight Riders here, the stylish right-hander made a statement on match eve on Thursday.On Thursday, Virat Kohli and Phil Salt were the first batters to start proceedings in the team’s first full training session after the break. As the opening duo showcased their range of shots, Patidar focused on basic fitness routines near the boundary line.The 31-year-old played shadow shots before heading towards the nets. To begin with, Patidar, who strapped his finger, took some low throwdowns. It was evident that the player was trying to test his finger, which was taped. Once Patidar felt comfortable, he walked towards the main nets and got down to business.Initially, he lacked power in his shots, even miscuing a few. Patidar, who was watched closely by batting coach and mentor Dinesh Karthik , pushed a few balls to either side of the wicket before unleashing his big hits. Most of it landed in the stands, with his timing being a standout feature. With every shot, Patidar grew in confidence and brought out his trademark aerial cover drives. While Patidar’s show during training is a huge relief for the team, it also strengthens the Madhya Pradesh player’s case for the England tour. Proving his match fitness will be crucial with an India A squad call-up in the pipeline.While focus was on Patidar’s fitness, others got their time in the middle, including Karnataka’s Mayank Agarwal, who is Devdutt Padikkal’s injury replacement. The bowling unit, led by Krunal Pandya and Bhuvneshwar Kumar, went through the grind. The latter has a huge role to play for the in-form franchise, with Josh Hazlewood’s availability in question and South Africa pacer Lungi Ngidi set to miss the Playoffs.The KKR squad, barring Rovman Powell and Moeen Ali, too got down to business. Confirming the duo’s absence, the franchise stated, “Powell and Ali couldn’t come back due to medical reasons. Rovman is undergoing a procedure, while Moeen and his family are down with a viral infection.”Saturday’s clash – with rain threat looming – is a big game for the visitors, who lie in sixth place and a defeat will make matters difficult for them in the Playoff race. On the other hand, RCB, who lie second with 16 points from 11 games, have all but sealed their berth.","Royal Challengers Bengaluru face Kolkata Knight Riders on Saturday.

Poll Do you believe Ben Stokes will return to peak form after his rehabilitation? No, I have doubts. Yes, absolutely!

Greenstone Lobo predicts Virat Kohli & Rohit Sharma's ODI future

England cricket star Ben Stokes , who has been sidelined since December due to a hamstring injury, discussed his rehabilitation journey and expressed his determination to return as a full-time pace bowling all-rounder . Speaking to Sky Sports, the 33-year-old detailed his recovery process since surgery in January and his preparations for upcoming Test series against India at home and the Ashes series in Australia.Stokes has been undergoing one of the longest rehabilitation periods of his career, focusing on comprehensive recovery to ensure he returns to the field in peak condition.""I always work hard. My ethos when I am injured is that I come back fitter than I was before I got injured,"" Stokes told Sky Sports.""I have worked incredibly hard on all aspects of everything, from my cricket to fitness, and know I am going to be in a position when I am back on the field to potentially be in physically the best possible shape I have been in,"" he said.The hamstring injury initially occurred during the Hundred tournament last August, causing him to miss four consecutive Tests against Sri Lanka and Pakistan.His attempt to expedite recovery for the New Zealand tour led to a relapse, but the current break in the international calendar has provided him adequate time for proper rehabilitation.""The first time I pulled my hamstring, there was such a small timeframe to try and get myself ready for that series against Pakistan,"" Stokes explained.""To walk back on to the field after nine weeks with the hamstring tear I had was a pretty good effort, but there were days I had no interest in doing what I needed to do.""""That rehab period then looked a lot different to this period. We had to fast-track certain periods of a normal rehab with a hamstring just to pass me fit to play, whereas this time around the medical team and I said we are going to nail it because we have got the time absolutely.""""The time has allowed me not to have to get into the mindset of every day waking up and thinking about what I need to do to feel right in my head that I am fit. Those are the unseen things that people from outside don't necessarily see.""""It was a tough old slog and was very tiring and taxing, not just physically but also mentally, doing something every single day to try and get myself to the next level of my rehab. It does take it out of you; it was pretty much every day for about six weeks where I had to do something, three or four sessions a day, it was tough.""Stokes emphasized that his current recovery has been more structured, allowing for gradual progression through various stages of rehabilitation.""I am not fully through that yet, but we are at the back end of the four-month period, and I am excited to get back to playing this summer,"" he stated.England will face Zimbabwe in a one-off Test on May 22 before their series against India.Stokes revealed his ongoing discussions with head coach Brendon McCullum about managing his return and regaining his world-class form.""I am 33, I don't want to expose myself to a situation where I am off the field when I don't have to be,"" Stokes said.""I talk to Baz a lot about many different things, we have spoken about this kind of stuff and how he is going to help me better, how he is going to speak to me a lot more about this stuff. We have worked together for so long, we know each other inside out, and those discussions we have had over the last couple of months have been very good.""""I feel great. Training and playing are completely different. No matter what you do at training, you cannot replicate the intensity your body is put through in a game. As excited as I am to get back on the field, I know it will be different to my training.""""But in terms of my role as a player, that full seamer, batting at six, trying to dominate every situation I find myself, whether I have got a bat or ball in my hand, is what I want to get back doing out on the field, on the biggest stage. I know I have done it before, it is something I am very confident in myself that I can do.""",England cricket star Ben Stokes has been sidelined since December due to a hamstring injury.

'Not a kid'

Bombay Sport Exchange Ep 5: Shane Watson on IPL, India-Australia rivalry | Part 1

At just 17 years old Lamine Yamal now has two La Liga titles to his name -- the same as Cristiano Ronaldo managed in nine years at Real Madrid.While his participation in the first was limited to a single brief cameo as a record-breaking 15-year-old debutant, the winger has been a chief architect of Barcelona's success this season. It was fitting he should make the breakthrough against Espanyol on Thursday with a sensational curling effort as Barca clinched the title.Yamal's breathtaking displays have brought a vibrancy and life back to Barcelona that had been lacking since the club's biggest icon, Lionel Messi, departed in 2021.Former Barca coach Xavi Hernandez brought Yamal on for the final seven minutes of a win over Real Betis in April 2023 at the Camp Nou, as the Catalans went on to win the league for the first time since 2019. It was a false dawn for a dutiful but dull Barca side, which ended the next season trophyless, precipitating Xavi's exit.Real Madrid's La Liga and Champions League double left Barcelona soul searching, with Yamal's growth the only bright spot. By early 2024 the fast dribbling, immensely skillful winger had emerged as the team's key attacker -- albeit one still lacking in consistency.Spain coach Luis de la Fuente placed his faith in the teenager's talent, saying Yamal was ""touched by the magic wand of God"", and he excelled in their Euro 2024 triumph. A good omen then for incoming Barca coach Hansi Flick, whose free-flowing attacking style clicked with Yamal, as well as veteran striker Robert Lewandowski and Raphinha on the left flank.Yamal won the right-wing position, which was the Brazilian dynamo's preferred role, but Raphinha was happy to shift to accommodate him. ""Seeing him come on in this stadium, with all these people, is incredible,"" said Raphinha after Yamal's debut, in front of 90,000 fans.""He will be very important for the club."" Raphinha was right, and it happened far quicker than he or Yamal could have reasonably expected. ""I left my fear in the park in (my hometown) Mataro,"" said Yamal, before playing in the recent Champions League semi-final against Inter Milan, where he produced two sensational displays as Barca came up fractionally short.Inter scraped through 7-6 on aggregate but their coach Simone Inzaghi labelled Yamal a ""phenomenon"", who only comes along ""every 50 years"".With 13 assists Yamal has the most in La Liga, and is the top dribbler, with nearly double the amount of his closest contender, Sevilla's Dodi Lukebakio. Yamal's irrepressible teen spirit is a big factor, with the youngster undaunted when Barcelona fall behind.""The mentality of my team is unbelievable,"" said Flick after Barcelona beat Madrid 4-3 on Sunday to virtually seal their Liga triumph. He thrived in all four Clasicos this season, as Barca triumphed each time.They won the Copa del Rey and Spanish Super Cup by beating Real in finals earlier in 2025, before completing a domestic treble with La Liga.""He's not a kid,"" said Flick, after Barca returned from two goals down against Madrid, inspired by Yamal, who gestured for calm when his team were up against the wall. ""He has the self-confidence, the belief in what he can do.""The winger remembers his roots and celebrates goals by signalling the 304 postcode of his neighbourhood Rocafonda. ""Three trophies for Barca, no trophies for Real Madrid, four Clasicos won by Barca,"" joked Barca great Hristo Stoichkov.Yamal is not afraid of a pithy jibe at rivals himself, making him a hit on social media and cementing his fan favourite status -- his No 19 shirt is the top seller. The winger will soon put pen to paper on a new Barcelona contract when he turns 18 in July.He marked his 17th birthday by winning Euro 2024 the next day, and this year he will celebrate by committing his future to the club he has been linked with since birth.Yamal joined Barca's feted La Masia youth academy aged seven, but as a baby remarkably was photographed being bathed by Messi for a charity calendar project.The teenager eschews comparisons to Barca's best ever player and the eight-time Ballon d'Or winner, yet they just keep coming.With Barcelona out of the Champions League, Yamal's hopes of winning the coveted individual award are dented but he might not have to wait long.""I'm really happy that this talent which comes along every 50 years plays for Barca,"" said Flick.",Lamine Yamal has won two La Liga titles with Barcelona. The 17-year-old scored the winning goal against Espanyol on Thursday. The winger has been a chief architect of Barca's success this season. He has been linked with a move away from the Nou Camp.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121201269,imgsize-42554,width-400,resizemode-4/Lamine-Yamal-vs-Espanyol.jpg"

Lamine Yamal delivers on the big stage of La Liga

A title built on unity, youth, and tactical discipline

FC Barcelona are the 2024-25 La Liga Champions after their battling 2-0 win over local rivals Espanyol at the RCDE Stadium saw off their challenge, and confirm their status as the dominant force in Spanish football. As a result of this outcome, Barca have now guaranteed an unassailable position at the top of the table mathematically guaranteeing the title with two games left to play.It is the club's 28th La Liga title and the first under head coach Hansi Flick, who has re-jigged the team tactically to great effect and helped them secure a dip in a season of steady, defensive capabilities and flashes from exciting young talents.The critical moment of the evening arrived in the 52nd minute, and fittingly from the boot of teenager prodigy Lamine Yamal. The 17-year-old left the visitors chasing shadows in a nervy Catalan derby, as he cut in from the right wing and sent a sensational curling shot into the far corner from the corner of the box, with Espanyol’s goalkeeper rooted to the spot. In the 96th minute, Fermin Lopez scored a stunner to give them a 2-0 lead.The target brought wild festive jubilations among the fans who made the trip to Madrid, aware that 3 points here would only be enough to secure the crown. Yamal was not only the match winner, but also emblematic of a generational change through the line-up — a guard that has been instrumental in driving Barcelona to their most recent domestic glory.The story of Barcelona’s 2024–25 season has been one of revival and regeneration. In his first season in charge, Hansi Flick has engineered a tactical revolution which has seen strict discipline blend with freedom in attack. The Stars’ resurgence has come from the ideal balance of youthful exuberance and dogged experience in the form of established world stars, Robert Lewandowski and Pulisic, alongside breaking-out performances from the young core such as Yamal, Fermin Lopez, Pau Cubarsi, and Ilkay Gundogan.Also Read: Here’s how much Barcelona can make by winning La Liga this season Richly pressed by Real Madrid and Girona earlier in the campaign, Barca held their nerve and began to close down the opposition, ultimately stringing wins together at crucial points in the run-in. A rock-solid defense — the anointed best in the league — and clinical finishing in close matches were the difference.When the final whistle sounded, Barcelona players celebrated their 2-0 victory on Espanyol’s field, confirming what their fans had longed to hear: that domestic dominance had been restored. Barcelona can now set about refocusing for the business end of the season and building into an era in which they can compete again for a place at the top table of European football.","FC Barcelona are the 2024-25 La Liga Champions after their battling 2-0 win over local rivals Espanyol.

Details of the incident outside RCDE Stadium

Match proceedings resume after the incident

The incident happened moments before the eagerly anticipated La Liga clash between Barcelona and Espanyol at the RCDE Stadium in Cornellà de Llobregat. The game was temporarily interrupted early in the opening minutes when a car drove into a group of fans outside the stadium. The incident immediately raised an alarm, with medical and police teams reaching the spot.A white Peugeot 208 reportedly driven by a woman spun out of control and drove into the fans outside the entrance of the stadium. The taxi was said to have driven in fits and starts, forwards and backwards, before it stopped. Thirteen were injured, nine slightly, four less seriously.Around a dozen are believed to have been injured, but none seriously, after a driver lost control of their vehicle and ploughed into fans prior to the game.The event has understandably spooked all those associated with the fans at the RCDE stadium, with increased security reported around the ground. The club and local officials have since revealed that they would review and add more elements to crowd safety protocols to ensure such an incident does not repeat itself.Meanwhile, outside the stadium, the tension continued, but for a while, the match went ahead. The game was stopped after about the eighth minute by referee César Soto Grado, who consulted with security officials and evaluated the circumstances. The stadium’s public address system informed fans that no one was seriously hurt, and the game continued a short time later.Also Read: Here’s how much Barcelona can make by winning La Liga this season The RCDE Stadium seats about 40,000 and is situated in the Barcelona metropolitan area. It is the stadium of RCD Espanyol, and due to its proximity to the major routes, it becomes a good area on match days. The episode has sparked questions about safety for pedestrians around the stadium.As investigations continue, both clubs have expressed their relief that the situation was resolved without any life-threatening injuries. The focus now shifts to ensuring the safety of supporters attending future matches and preventing such incidents from occurring again.","A Peugeot 208 reportedly driven by a woman spun out of control and drove into the fans outside the entrance of the stadium.

Renovation at Camp Nou stadium delays prompt fixture adjustments

Partial reopening with limited capacity at Camp Nou

FC Barcelona is to ask La Liga for the first three matches of the 2025–26 season to be given as away games . The strategic maneuver will buy some time to complete the ongoing renovation of the iconic Camp Nou stadium, which is expected to partially reopen by mid-September 2025.The total renovation cost on Camp Nou — to make it into Europe’s largest stadium, with 105,000 seats — has been estimated at €1.5 billion, and construction has been marred with multiple delays. Based on plans, then, for the November 2024 full reopening to the public, passage to the summer of 2026, both announced dates had become mere pipe dreams. To fit construction into their stadium, Barcelona have been playing home games at Estadi Olímpic Lluís Companys since May 2023.Barcelona has asked to play its first three league games away to enable the partially built Camp Nou to be ready to welcome fans safely and smoothly. The strategy is similar to that used by other clubs during stadium upgrades to avoid or reduce the impact on revenue from a lack of matches being staged.When reopened in September 2025, the Camp Nou will have a capacity of around 60,000, while some facilities, including fixed seating, full catering services, and permanent access routes, are yet to be fully built. The club will be using a digital season ticket system, which means fans will have to give advance confirmation of attendance in a bid to manage the limited capacity effectively. It follows the temporary withdrawal of the Seient Lliure system, which permits season ticket holders to release their seat for resale until the Camp Nou is 100% operational.Also Read: Here’s how much Barcelona can make by winning La Liga this season The last stage of construction, finishing with the roof of the stadium being installed, as well as refurbishments to VIP areas, will be complete by mid-2026, officials said. Once fully operational, Camp Nou will have better facilities to generate more revenues on matchdays and to offer fans a completely new match day experience.Barcelona's willingness to work with La Liga to rearrange their opening fixtures is a strong signal of the club’s desire to guarantee the best possible return to their iconic former home while offering their committed fans the safety and satisfaction they deserve.",Barcelona have asked La Liga for the first three matches of the 2025–26 season to be given as away games.

Expected earnings for FC Barcelona from the La Liga title win

Why a La Liga title would boost Barcelona’s financial recovery

If Barcelona wins the league this year, they will have a significant windfall. The Spanish top tier, at a time when in Spain it comes not only with profile and sporting success but also a huge chunk of media revenues and commercial incentives, which could relieve the club’s financial weight.Unlike some other leading European leagues, La Liga does not offer a set amount of prize money for the champion. The money-spinners are TV rights revenue, which is distributed between all 20 clubs. The highest share of the pool goes to the champion club.Barcelona would get a proportion of around 17% of that total, which is around €58.4 million based on the current figures. If you also added performance and market variable payments, the club could exceed €200 million. This consists of regular-season earnings plus bonuses based on the team’s success and final league standing.But we should remember that Barcelona already sold a piece of its future TV rights to the American investment firm Sixth Street. This short-term liquidating deal means a percentage of La Liga money will go towards paying that off.And La Liga doesn’t hand over the whole sum up front. The payment is doled out over five years: 35% the first year, 20% the second, and 15% each of the next three. This prevents financial insecurity and encourages responsible spending over the short term.The league title would be a significant step ahead for Barcelona on and off the pitch. There are financial incentives too – signing new players, renegotiating existing contracts, and even buying players with more reassurance.On the field, success also leads to enhanced sponsorship deals, global fan appeal, and greater brand presence. With the club still working through La Liga’s stringent financial fair play regulations , every extra euro goes toward rebuilding the club’s long-term financial structure.Also Read: FC Barcelona confirms new deal for 18-year-old left-back until 2028 Winning La Liga could potentially free them financially for the next few years and would help Barca to return to its desired status as the biggest global power in football. It would boost the club’s bargaining power in sponsorship and merchandising contracts, leading to more valuable deals. It would be good for fans, it would put bums in seats, and it would bring in more ticket and merchandise money.","La Liga does not offer a set amount of prize money for the champion.

The contract dispute at the heart of the battle

PSG's €98 million counterclaim raises stakes

Kylian Mbappé and Paris Saint-Germain are currently involved in a dispute about €55 million of wages that Paris Saint-Germain is allegedly owing the player. Parish Saint Germain has responded by filing a suit for nearly double the total, and tensions are growing between the footballer and the club where he made his name. It became even more challenging as Mbappé’s lawyers got a court order in April 2025 to freeze €55 million of Paris Saint-Germain’s funds, though only €14 million has been returned so far.The conflict started after Kylian Mbappé was temporarily kept from the first team due to an agreement between the club and the player made in the summer of 2023. Paris Saint-Germain says that Mbappé agreed to give up €55 million in bonuses when he decided to rejoin the squad, but his legal team claims that the agreement was never officially put in writing.According to Kylian Mbappé, in January 2024, the plan he made with the president protects everyone, but his legal team is now arguing that this agreement was not properly filed with the LFP, meaning it is not valid.On Monday, Paris Saint-Germain filed a counterclaim, requesting €98 million (around $109 million) from Kylian Mbappé, because of ""delays"" and ""misleading conduct"" during negotiations. Renaud Semerdjian, the club’s lawyer, went so far as to claim that Kylian Mbappé had ""asked for the world from Paris Saint-Germain, received it, and then tried to take it all away.""Kylian Mbappé’s lawyer, Thomas Clay, challenged Paris Saint-Germain by asking about their financial transparency. The club is funded all year by the sovereign state of Qatar. Accounting transparency is important, as the absence of it can result in recovery situations.The decision from the Paris Judicial Court will be made on May 26, 2025, right before Paris Saint-Germain plays in the Coupe de France final and the UEFA Champions League final against Inter Milan. Fans who are following the case will be able to watch the court decision on the major sports networks.Also Read: Kylian Mbappe net worth: How rich is the French superstar and Real Madrid’s newest signing?

Cristiano Ronaldo leads Forbes 2025 list of highest-paid athletes,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/news/cristiano-ronaldo-leads-forbes-2025-list-of-highest-paid-athletes/articleshow/121192063.cms,"Image Source: Getty

A record-breaking year for Cristiano Ronaldo

The competition wasn’t even close

Why Cristiano Ronaldo remains a global icon

Cristiano Ronaldo is at it again—on and off the pitch. The Portuguese soccer icon has been named the No. 1 earner on Forbes’ list of highest-paid athletes in the world for 2025, bankrolling an eye-popping $275 million over the past year. That figure makes for the third-highest-earning annual amount of all time, for any active athlete, in Forbes’ history and underscores the unmatched commercial power of Ronaldo even at 40.Cristiano Ronaldo’s $275-million net worth is a combination of his on-the-pitch salary and off-pitch revenue through endorsements and a range of business interests. Ronaldo, who moved from his former club to the Italian club Juventus, to Saudi Pro League team Al Nassr, is now believed to have his “wages more than double” to a reported north of $200 million a year. But what really sets him apart is his off-field earnings, which are comprised of lucrative sponsorships from around the world, personal brands, and plenty of business interests, including CR7-branded hotels, fragrances and gyms.For context, the closest athlete on the list, basketball superstar LeBron James, earned $133.8 million this year, less than half of what Ronaldo banked. But despite growing his business interests with movies and buying a sports team, James’ earnings still fall way short of Ronaldo’s record-breaking jackpot.What is even more revealing is that he standard for entering the Forbes top 50 highest-paid athletes has never been shinier. In 2025, the bottom of the list was $53.6 million, a 19 percent increase from the $45.2 million posted in 2024. In 2017, that figure was $27.2 million. At the time, if an athlete’s performance today would’ve plopped them at No. 6 overall.Also Read: Lionel Messi or Cristiano Ronaldo—find out whose team is more valuable in 2025 club rankings One of the most eye-opening aspects of Cristiano Ronaldo’s continued financial sway is just his age and how long he has been unstoppable. Most athletes see their earnings potential wane with age, but Ronaldo seems to be the exception to the rule. His transfer to Saudi Arabia not only prolonged his career but also expanded his reach and exposed him to new markets and audiences, thereby increasing his commercial value.Cristiano Ronaldo's domination of Forbes' list for 2025 shows he is more than just a footballer; the five-time Ballon d'Or winner has become a commercial juggernaut whose brand and reach are only expanding into his twilight years.This longevity of dominance is proof of Ronaldo’s genius brand building off the pitch. By launching his own CR7 clothing, fragrance, and fitness line, as well as working with mega brands such as Nike and Binance, Ronaldo has developed a diversified empire that doesn't rely solely on his on-field success. His enormous social media reach means anything he becomes affiliated with gets unprecedented global exposure, further securing his marketability even though he has outlasted the typical career trajectory of an ageing athlete.","Cristiano Ronaldo is the No. 1 earner on Forbes' list of highest-paid athletes in the world for 2025.

Ukrainian left-back Oleksandr Zinchenko talks the most

“He speaks too much,”

Best friend at Arsenal and future manager plans

Arsenal skipper Martin Odegaard recently enjoyed a light-hearted and open interview, giving supporters a unique insight into the atmosphere in the dressing room at the Gunners. Famed for his cool head on the pitch and his intelligent footballing brain, Odegaard has shown his funnier side with this lighthearted Q&A. While the Norwegian skipper didn’t hold back, especially when it came to picking out who he’d least like to be stuck in a lift with, or naming his best pals at Arsenal, or his future assistant manager.Asked which of his teammates he’d least like to be stuck in a lift with, Odegaard faculty named poor old Oleksandr Zinchenko.the Arsenal captain laughed, clearly in love with the Ukrainian left-back and coasting off his energy.To make things even more fun, Odegaard added that Zinchenko not only talks a lot, but he also talks fast. Even with the kidding, it’s clear they are the best of friends, the comment is more teasing than catty.The interview provided a fascinating insight into the characters that inhabit Mikel Arteta’s squad and also served as a timely reminder that, beyond all the tactics and congested fixtures list, there’s some serious lols and chemistry in the Arsenal changeroom.When Martin Odegaard was asked about his best friend at the club, he was quick to point out that he has a good relationship with most of the players, but Kai Havertz is the one. The two have forged a deep understanding, not just in Arsenal's midfield, but well beyond it.Indeed, when posed a hypothetical about which one player he would want as an assistant coach in 2050, Odegaard didn’t blink: Kai Havertz.It’s a measure of Odegaard’s respect for him — he was a Real Madrid player, too, and if he is here on loan, he is in London to serve as an equal, not a subordinate — and it’s a sign of just how settled Havertz has become at Arsenal since leaving Chelsea. Add a sense of humour, friendship, and forward-thinking to your Arsenal team culture , and Odegaard’s interview underlines the one gripping the soul of Arsenal this season.Also Read: English Premier League: Arsenal fight back to hold Liverpool; Newcastle inch closer to Champions League spot",Martin Odegaard gave a light-hearted and open interview to Arsenal fans.

The excitement is building ahead of the next Formula E race as Japan gets ready to host the second season of the Tokyo E-Prix. But the weather forecast shows a 100 percent chance of rainfall on both Saturday and Sunday. This is enough to concern the Formula E drivers, as—despite the much-improved Gen3 Evo cars this year running on Hankook tyres—racing in rain comes with hard-to-overcome challenges and risks. However, the rain may skip the Round 9 race Sunday evening. Here’s the complete weather forecast for the Tokyo Formula E race.According to Metcheck.com, the weather in Tokyo is expected to remain pleasant at 21 degrees Celsius on Friday, though it will be a cloudy day. There are only slight chances of rain as the Formula E drivers take part in the First Free Practice session at 4 pm (local time) and 12:30 pm IST.The temperature will remain in the range of 18–20 degrees Celsius on Saturday. However, there is a 100 percent chance of rain throughout the day. Rain in the range of 2.6 mm to 3.3 mm is expected during the Second Free Practice at 8 am (local time) and the Qualifying race at 10:20 am (local time). The rain is expected to be much lighter, at 0.9 mm, during the main Round 8 race at 3:05 pm (local time), which will be broadcast in India at 11:35 am.The temperature will be in the range of 19–20 degrees Celsius on Sunday, while the rain will continue to be as heavy as the day before. There is a 100 percent chance of around 3.8 mm of rain during the Third Free Practice at 8 am (local time) and the Round 9 Qualifying at 10:20 am. But the good news is that no rain is predicted for the main Round 9 race, which will start at 3:05 pm (local time) and 11:35 am IST.Mitch Evans told RacingNews365.com that it was “very, very tricky” to race in wet conditions with the Hankook tyres in the recent races. He said, “In qualifying it was like, I was terrible. Nothing, you can't wake them [the tyres] up. In the race I was way more comfortable from the start, but the pace difference between me and some other guys was huge. So yeah, you can quickly be two, three seconds a lap slower.”Also Read: Tokyo E-Prix 2025: Schedule, timing and where to watch Round 8 and Round 9 Formula E races Nyck De Vries told the portal about racing in wet conditions, ""If it's wet, you're not even reaching full throttle. So, it's more like surviving rather than racing in the wet. Obviously, street tracks are always challenging in the wet, and grip levels are low.""","The weather forecast shows a 100 percent chance of rainfall on both Saturday and Sunday.

This initiative is designed to offer hands-on experience and exposure to E-Karting, aligning with Formula E’s broader social impact mission of involving and engaging local communities at every race location.Japanese-American racing driver and content creator Hana Burton, along with active rally driver Maaya Orido—who competes in the XCR Sprint Cup Hokkaido and Rally Hokkaido—will also be present at the event. The FIA Girls on Track program is proudly supported by Hankook (Presenting Partner), ABB (Principal Partner), and Fortescue Zero (Official Partner).This marks the second season of the Tokyo E-Prix, following its debut last year.

It’s super technical and super challenging for us and the teams to set everything up properly. To get super close to the walls, you have to have good confidence in the car, and there’s even jumps that we have in a lap, so it’s a big mixture of everything! For me that is what Formula E is all about, to race so tight around these street circuits.”Jaguar TCS Racing driver Nick Cassidy, who earned the ABB Driver of Progress Award with 12 overtakes during the race, praised the track as well. Reflecting on his experience, he said, “It was a mega, a proper Formula E track. Bumps, fast corners, on the limit and you’ve really got to attack in qualifying. I thought the track was fantastic.”Set in the heart of Tokyo Bay , the 2.575km circuit features 18 turns and boasts a compact, technical layout that includes three long straights and three chicane sequences.

Drama at SCG! Nervous Rohit Sharma jumps out of his seat for Virat Kohli’s golden duck call,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/india-in-australia/drama-at-scg-nervous-rohit-sharma-jumps-out-of-his-seat-for-virat-kohlis-golden-duck-call/articleshow/116899509.cms,"Gautam Gambhir's serious one-on-one chat with Jasprit Bumrah

NEW DELHI: Just as the MCG Test had its share of drama, the SCG Test delivered a moment of high tension when a contentious umpiring decision went in favour of India’s star batter Virat Kohli . The drama unfolded in the 8th over when Kohli survived a golden duck on his very first delivery.After dismissing Yashasvi Jaiswal earlier in the over, Scott Boland nearly claimed his second wicket with a well-directed delivery that found Kohli’s outside edge. The ball flew toward second slip, where Steve Smith dived to his right, scooping it toward Marnus Labuschagne at gully.However, replays revealed the ball had brushed the ground after rolling off Smith’s fingers—a detail spotted by TV umpire Joel Wilson , who ruled Kohli not out.The Indian dressing room watched the drama unfold on the big screen, with Rohit Sharma , who had been excluded from the playing XI, visibly tense.Once the decision came through in Kohli’s favour, Rohit finally sat back, appearing more at ease.Rohit scored 31 runs in five innings across three Tests.Last year Rohit guided India to a much-awaited T20 World Cup title.","Virat Kohli survives a golden duck on his very first delivery.

Another controversy erupted early on the first morning of the fifth Test between India and Australia in Sydney when a relay catch involving Steve Smith and Marnus Labuschagne off Virat Kohli 's bat was ruled by the third umpire as not legitimate.With Indian openers KL Rahul (4) and Yashasvi Jaiswal (10) dismissed early, India were 17 for 2 when Kohli came in to bat and edged the first ball he faced from Scott Boland to the slips, where the Aussie players claimed the relay catch between Smith and Labuschagne.Diving low to his right, Smith believed to have got his fingers underneath the ball before lobbing it in the air for Labuschagne to complete the catch. The decision was referred by the on-field umpires for review, and the third umpire ruled that the ball grazed the ground before Smith lobbed it back up.Talking to Fox Cricket at the lunch break, Smith said he has no doubt that it was a clean catch, but they have to accept the decision taken by the match officials.""Did you get your hand underneath that ball?"" former England player turned commentator Isa Guha asked Smith?""100%, no denying it whatsoever. But the umpires made the decision, and we move on,"" replied Smith.After replays were shown on the giant screen and the third umpire announced his view, Kohli was seen shaking his head with a wry smile on his face.India went to lunch at a shaky 57 for 3, losing Shubman Gill (20) off the last ball delivered by off-spinner Nathan Lyon before the break, leaving Kohli on the crease at 20 not out. He was joined by Rishabh Pant post lunch.Earlier, India left captain Rohit Sharma out of the eleven, with Jasprit Bumrah doing the leadership duty and chose to bat first after winning the toss.India made two changes to their team. Shubman Gill took Rohit's place, while Prasidh Krishna came in for fellow pacer Akash Deep who is out with a back injury.","Third umpire rules Steve Smith and Marnus Labuschagne's relay catch off Virat Kohli not legitimate.

KOHLI IN ONGOING BGT:

NEW DELHI: Virat Kohli ’s struggles against deliveries outside the off-stump have become a glaring issue in the series, further denting the confidence of India’s star batter.During the SCG Test , Kohli’s lean patch with the bat continued as he fell to another outside-off delivery, this time from Scott Boland.Kohli managed 17 runs off 69 balls, marking the longest innings of his Test career without hitting a boundary. Boland bowled with precision, consistently targeting the corridor outside off and eventually induced an edge from Kohli.The catch was a stunner, as Beau Webster dived to his left to complete a brilliant grab, sending Kohli back to the pavilion.This marked the fourth time Boland has dismissed Kohli in Test cricket, with all four dismissals involving catches by the wicketkeeper or in the slip cordon.Kohli’s performance in the series has been below par, accumulating just 184 runs in 8 innings at an average of 26.29.Perth Test: 5 and 100*Adelaide Test: 7 and 11Brisbane Test: 3Melbourne Test: 36 and 5Sydney Test: 17 and Yet to bat",Virat Kohli dismissed by Scott Boland for 17 runs in SCG Test.

IND vs AUS: Rohit Sharma dropped! Exclusive visuals of his last session with India Test team

The Australian cricket team erupted in joy after what seemed to be an astonishing team catch off Virat Kohli ’s first ball on the opening day of the fifth Test at the Sydney Cricket Ground.However, third umpire Joel Wilson ruled it not out.Kohli edged the ball to Steve Smith in the slips, who dived low to his right and managed to pop the ball up, allowing Marnus Labuschagne to take the catch.Despite this, the decision was overturned by Wilson, as it appeared that the ball had grazed the ground after Smith’s attempt.This ruling has sparked considerable debate among fans and experts alike.Former Australia opener and coach Justin Langer believes Kohli was out. “From what I have seen there, that makes it more obvious to me that should have been out. Steve Smith had his fingers (underneath the ball), and you could see he was flicking the ball up, it was brilliant what he did,” he said on 7 Cricket.“He had his fingers under the ball, he flicked it up deliberately and in my opinion that’s out.”Ricky Ponting agreed with Langer.“As far as I was concerned, if (the ball) had’ve come out of (Smith’s) hand, he wouldn’t have been able to scoop it up,” he said on 7 Cricket.“I think his fingers are clearly underneath the ball … look where his pointer figure is there, it’s still underneath the ball.”Former Test umpire Simon Taufel on Channel 7 explained why the Virat Kohli first-ball review was hard to judge.“I think you described it very well when you said that depending upon which side of the fence you sit on you could probably build a case for either decision to be given,” he said.“Listening to Joel Wilson’s language there, where he said the fingers were underneath the ball and then he’s seen it roll on to the ground, by his own language he is telling us that he believes he’s seeing that ball on the ground.“So, there are two things that the TV umpire here is looking for. One is fingers underneath the ball. He was satisfied there. But then he believes through those pictures that he’s clearly seen the ball on the ground.“And here’s the challenge, slowing it right down with slow-mo. Play it at real speed and it looks pretty good.“I can certainly understand what the third umpire’s done there. He believes he’s seen the ball on the ground and called it way he’s seen it. Normally the ICC protocol on fair catches is if you see the fingers underneath the ball, that’s good to maintain a fair catch.“But here’s the problem: the on-field umpire’s no longer have the soft signal and make the decision, it’s purely in the hands of the television umpire now.”Mark Waugh, in commentary for Fox, also felt it was out.“Virat Kohli will breath a huge sigh of relief, Australian fans will feel they’ve been robbed, Indian fans (it’s) desperate relief,” Isa Guha said on Fox Cricket.Mark Waugh believes the finger was underneath the ball when it touched the turf.“It would’ve been a great catch … I think it was … he’s not happy,” he said.“You see his right finger just underneath it … I think he’s got away with one there Kohli.”Former Australian greater Allan Border was unsure. “Those ones looks so close, it’s hard to tell,” he said.Ex-India allrounder Irfan Pathan said Kohli was rightly given not out.“Virat Kohli was not out which was rightly called NOT OUT. will explain during the break,” Pathan wrote on X.","Virat Kohli edged the ball to Steve Smith in the slips, who dived low to his right and managed to pop the ball up, allowing Marnus Labuschagne to take the catch.

'Very disappointed with the way Ashwin left': Anil Kumble,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/india-in-australia/very-disappointed-with-the-way-ashwin-left-anil-kumble/articleshow/116899449.cms,"File photo of India spinner R Ashwin.

R Ashwin announces retirement from Test cricket

Sportstar

Why R Ashwin retirement was a last minute surprise for Ravindra Jadeja

The Indian cricket team is currently navigating a period of transition in Test matches. This shift became apparent after the third Test of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy when R Ashwin unexpectedly announced his retirement from international cricket.Ashwin participated in the second Test but opted for immediate retirement, returning home the day after the third Test at the Gabba in Brisbane.This abrupt decision sparked discussions regarding the team management's approach to the esteemed spinner. Anil Kumble , another Indian cricket legend, expressed his annoyance with the way it was handled.In acolumn, Kumble shared his belief that Ashwin deserved a more fitting farewell. He felt a structured plan for Ashwin's exit should have been in place.""Players who have contributed for such a long period deserve a grand farewell. They need to be sat down and offered an appropriate plan on how you want them to leave the game. I was very disappointed with the way Ashwin left,"" wrote Ashwin in his column.""Many cricketers in the past missed out on a farewell, too. The kind of benchmarks he has set won’t be easy for anyone to live up to. He served Indian cricket with distinction.""Ashwin retired as India's second-highest wicket-taker in Test matches, trailing only Kumble himself. Kumble finished his career with 619 wickets, while Ashwin had 537.Kumble revealed he had encouraged Ashwin to aim for 600 wickets and subsequently 619. He believed Ashwin had the potential to achieve these milestones.""I remember telling Ashwin he should get to 600 when he crossed the 500 mark — and then 619. The way he was going, he had a very good chance. He didn’t have a great series against New Zealand, but that was one in 14 years.""Kumble was left equally ""perplexed"" by the team management's decision over the years to not use him in overseas conditions.""Unfortunately, the team management did not consistently select Ashwin to play in England, South Africa, and Australia, which has always perplexed me. With Ravindra Jadeja bowling in tandem, India could have had these two in every match. Ashwin has consistently picked wickets on every surface he has played on. So to typecast him as a spinner, mostly in subcontinent conditions, is not fair,"" wrote Kumble.Ashwin's performance against New Zealand was unusually lacklustre, managing only nine wickets in three Test matches. This series marked India's first-ever whitewash defeat in a three-Test home series.It was also India's first Test series loss at home since 2012. This series underscored the changing dynamics within the Indian Test cricket landscape.","R Ashwin unexpectedly announced his retirement from international cricket.

NEW DELHI: Zimbabwe's experienced campaigner Sikandar Raza and young talent Newman Nyamhuri on Thursday claimed three wickets apiece, restricting Afghanistan to 157 runs on Day 1 of the second Test in Bulawayo.Following a four-hour delay due to wet conditions at Queens Sports Club, Zimbabwe reached 6-0 at the close of play.Skipper Craig Ervine 's decision to field first after winning the toss proved advantageous, particularly after his bowlers struggled in the previous drawn Test, where they conceded 699 runs in the first innings.The strategy proved successful as Raza (3-30) and Nyamhuri (3-42) delivered impressive performances, each securing crucial Afghan wickets.""Given the conditions, I was convinced bowling first was the way to go. The wicket had been under covers for some time,"" said Ervine.The previous Test had witnessed Captain Hashmatullah Shahidi and Rahmat Shah scoring double centuries whilst establishing a national record partnership of 364 runs for the third wicket.After Afghanistan lost openers Abdul Malik (17) and Test debutant Riaz Hassan (12) with the score at 29, Shah and Shahidi reunited at the crease.However, unlike their previous performance, both batsmen struggled, with Shahidi scoring 13 and Shah managing 19.Nyamhuri, the 18-year-old in his second Test, dismissed Shahidi leg before wicket after the captain had struck two boundaries in a 30-run partnership with Shah.Raza then removed Shah, who missed the delivery that struck his leg stump. Rashid Khan 's quick 25 suggested a potential recovery before he was caught by Brian Bennett at deep point following a poor shot selection.With Afghanistan struggling at 125-8, a final wicket partnership of 27 runs between Zia-ur-Rehman (8 not out) and Fareed Ahmad (17) helped improve their total.",Sikandar Raza and Newman Nyamhuri take three wickets each on Day 1 of second Test.

NEW DELHI: India skipper Rohit Sharma has been dropped from the final Border-Gavaskar Trophy Test which starts from January 3 in Sydney.Amid a woeful run with the bat, the tough call on Rohit has been taken by the team management, as reported by TimesofIndia.com , and young Shubman Gill, in all likeliness, will replace the India captain in the playing XI for the Pink Test.With just 31 runs in five innings in the ongoing BGT, Rohit averaged a horrendous 6.20 and was really struggling with the bat.But Rohit's struggle has not only been limited to his outings Down Under.In the previous India vs New Zealand series at home, Rohit performed terribly as well, scoring a mere 91 runs in three Tests.Amid Rohit's run rut, the team too struggled as India suffered an unprecedented 0-3 whitewash against the BlackCaps. In the BGT as well, India currently trails 2-1.Throughout India's recent poor showings, Rohit maintained that India batters performed poorly. But recently Rohit has also taken personal responsibility, saying he has indeed under-performed with the bat.Here's a look at what Rohit has said recently in his pressers, starting with the New Zealand series:""I am hurting a little bit because I made that call (on wrongly accessing the pitch). We found ourselves in a situation where we got bowled out for 46 runs. As a captain, it definitely hurts to see that number.""Though in 365 days, you will make two or three bad calls. That is absolutely fine, I guess.""""The challenge that was thrown at us, we didn't respond well. Sometimes you make the right call, sometimes you don't. I was on the other side of it this time around,""""It was a bad day for us. But we have played many such matches before.""""I do not doubt anyone's ability. I won't do much postmortem of this, but batters must come with their plans and trust on the plans like New Zealand batters showed.""It's disappointing. It's not what we expected. We got to give credit to New Zealand as they played better than us. We failed to respond to those challenges.""I didn't think we batted well enough to get runs on the board. You've got to pick 20 wickets to win, yes, but batters have to put runs on the board.""Something like this will be a very low point of my career and I take full responsibility for it.""Yes absolutely (bitter pill to swallow). Losing a series, a Test match, is never easy... something that is not easily digestible. We didn't play our best cricket. New Zealand played better throughout the series. There were a lot of mistakes we did,"" Rohit said at the post-match presentation ceremony.""The first two Tests we did not put enough runs in the first innings. This game we got the 30 runs (28) lead and the target was chaseable.""We failed as a unit. When you are chasing a target like that, you want runs on the board. That was in my mind and it did not come of. When it does not come off it does not look great.""I go in with certain plans and those did not come off this series. We did not play our best cricket in these conditions and are facing the result of that.""""I was not at my best as captain in leading the team as well as with the bat also. Collectively as a unit we failed to perform,"" the India skipper said.""The way he (KL Rahul) has batted outside India, he deserves it. I will bat somewhere in the middle. It was a fairly simple decision. Personally, it wasn’t easy but for the team, it was an easy decision to make.""Maybe in the future, things will be different. I don't know. Based on what has happened and what KL Rahul has shown outside of India, he probably deserves that place at this point in time. It is something that has brought us success in the first Test.""You have that one big partnership with Jaiswal on the other side, and it probably won us the Test match. When you come here, in a place like Perth, and you get 500 runs or so, it’s such a massive tick in the box,"" he elaborated.""Disappointing week for us, we didn't play well enough to win the game and Australia played better than us.""We knew it was going to be challenging with the pink ball. Like I said, Australia was better than us.""We are quite looking forward to it (Gabba Test), there's not much time in between as well. We want to go out there and think about what we did right in Perth and what we did last time when we were.""I have not batted well. There's no harm in accepting that. But I know what's in my mind, how I'm preparing myself. All those boxes are very much ticked. It's just about spending as much time as possible, which I'm pretty sure I'm just there.""As long as my mind, my body, my feet are moving well, I'm pretty happy with how things are panning out for me. Sometimes those numbers can tell you that it's been a while since he's got big runs.""But for a person like me, it's all about how I feel in my mind, what kind of prep I'm having before each game, and how I'm feeling about myself. That's the most important thing. And I'm feeling good about myself, to be honest. Runs are obviously not showing that, but inside it's a different feeling,"" he said.""A lot of the things I am trying to do are not falling in the place that I would want to.""Mentally, look, it is disturbing without a doubt if you've come here and you want to try to do successfully what you are supposed to.""But as of now that is where it is and there are things that we as a team need to look at, and I personally need to look at as well.""We will see what happens. There is still a game to go.","India skipper Rohit Sharma has been dropped from the final Border-Gavaskar Trophy Test which starts from January 3 in Sydney.

How will a win in Sydney impact India's WTC Final chances?

IND vs AUS: Rohit Sharma dropped! Exclusive visuals of his last session with India Test team

NEW DELHI: The upcoming Sydney Test against Australia is a crucial match for Team India, as their chances of reaching the ICC World Test Championship (WTC) final hinge on the outcome.South Africa's narrow two-wicket win against Pakistan in Centurion confirmed their place as the first team to qualify for the WTC final, scheduled at Lord's next June.With only one spot remaining, India, Australia, and Sri Lanka are in contention, but the dynamics are stacked against India after recent setbacks.Australia’s emphatic 184-run win over India at the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG) was a significant blow to India’s aspirations. The defeat saw India drop to third place on the WTC standings , with their win percentage slipping to 52.78—well behind Australia and South Africa.This was India’s first defeat to significantly shift qualification out of their control in this WTC cycle. A victory at Sydney is non-negotiable for India to keep their hopes alive.Winning at the Sydney Cricket Ground (SCG) would elevate India’s win percentage to 55.26, keeping them in the hunt for the final berth.However, India would also need favourable results from Australia’s two-Test series against Sri Lanka.Specifically, India would hope for Australia to fail to secure a win, as any Australian victory against Sri Lanka would end India’s hopes, regardless of India’s performance at the SCG.Australia, meanwhile, can secure their spot with a win at the SCG. This would raise their win percentage to an unassailable 57, locking them in for the WTC final regardless of Sri Lanka's performance.Even if the SCG Test results in a draw, Australia’s chances remain strong, requiring only a single drawn match in their series against Sri Lanka to edge out both India and Sri Lanka.For India, the stakes are monumental. Failure to win at Sydney would see them eliminated from contention, marking a disappointing end to their WTC campaign. Amid the high stakes and growing tensions, India have decided to drop Rohit Sharma for the fifth and final test of the series, as reported by TimesofIndia.com.With their destiny tethered to results beyond their control, the Sydney Test appears to be nothing short of make-or-break for India.","India's chances of reaching the ICC World Test Championship final hinge on the outcome of the Sydney Test against Australia.

Former Indian cricketer Madan Lal has shared his views on Rohit Sharma 's captaincy and the team's performance, highlighting the need for a collective effort against a strong opponent like Australia.""As a team, you have to perform. You're playing against Australia, not Sri Lanka. You have to seize the moment. And Jasprit Bumrah is the only bowler taking wickets. The rest of them, they're taking wickets too, but not breaking through at the right moments,"" he told IANS.""Like, if you see… Mohammed Siraj took wickets. But the thing is, when did he take those wickets? When 400 runs had already been scored, or 300 runs, or 250, or 400 runs,"" he added.Jasprit Bumrah's performance has been a highlight for India in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy . He currently leads the wicket-takers list with 30 wickets at an average of 12.83.Bumrah recently achieved the milestone of 200 Test wickets in Australia, becoming the fastest Indian pacer to do so. His 71 wickets in 2024 place him fifth on the list of most Test wickets by an Indian bowler in a calendar year.""When Bumrah is getting wickets, the bowler at the other end also needs to strike. Akash Deep took one or two wickets, but someone needs to bowl consistently. The only one consistently getting wickets is Jasprit. You need support from the other end too, and at the right time,"" he added.India faces a must-win situation in the Sydney Test to maintain their chances of reaching the World Test Championship Final . They also need Australia to lose at least one of their two Tests against Sri Lanka to secure their spot at Lord's in June.Madan Lal offered advice to the Indian team ahead of the crucial Sydney Test, emphasising the importance of staying calm and giving their best effort, despite the challenging conditions in Australia.""Don't panic. Believe in yourself. You have a good team with you, and you have a good bowling unit. You should come back strongly. It's a team game, not an individual game here. They are very, very experienced players, mature players, and they know their job.""He encouraged the team to avoid panic and believe in their abilities. He reminded them that they are a capable side with experienced players who understand their roles.""They need to do it with confidence. That's what I say. There is nothing to worry about. You are playing in Australia, at their home ground. You need to perform twice as well, because Australia is very strong at home, just like we are strong at our home.""Lal reiterated the importance of playing with confidence and recognising the strength of the Australian team at home. He compared it to India's dominance on home turf.""Whatever the team management decides, whatever the captain decides, you need to be in a good frame of mind when playing the Test match. Because being 2-1 down, if you win this Test match, you are worthy to square the series. That is very good, and I am sure they will do it.""",Former Indian cricketer Madan Lal has shared his views on Rohit Sharma's captaincy and the team's performance.

India's likely XI vs Australia for SCG Test

READ ALSO:

NEW DELHI: As reported by TimesofIndia.com, Team India are set to approach the final Test in Sydney without Rohit Sharma at the helm following a challenging run of form.His prolonged struggles with the bat, compounded by back-to-back defeats against New Zealand and Australia in the ongoing Border-Gavaskar Trophy (BGT), appears to have led to this omission.Despite experimenting with various batting positions, Rohit has been unable to revive his faltering Test career. The numbers tell a sobering story. In 2024, his performance fell well short of the high standards he once set. Averaging only 24.76 across 26 innings, his contributions include just two centuries and two half-centuries.In India’s last five Test defeats, Rohit's performance has nosedived, with his average plummeting to a mere 11.20 across 10 innings.His recent outings hint at a troubling pattern of inconsistency, yielding scores of 2 and 52, 0 and 8, along with a series of single-digit dismissals during the ongoing Australian tour.With India set to take the field at the Sydney Cricket Ground (SCG) on Friday without Rohit Sharma, here's a glimpse at how Team India could shape up against Australia:Rahul and Yashasvi Jaiswal have been the bright spots for India in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy. While Jaiswal's consistency at the top has been crucial, Rahul had to adjust to the No. 3 spot after Rohit Sharma opted to open at MCG, a position where he struggled to make a significant impact.With Rohit’s omission for the SCG Test, Rahul is set to reclaim his preferred opening slot, offering him a fresh opportunity to make a stronger impression.After being dropped for the fourth Test, Shubman Gill will likely return to the playing XI following an intense training session on the eve of the SCG Test.Meanwhile, Virat Kohli, despite his underwhelming form as well, is expected to retain his spot in the lineup. The same holds true for Rishabh Pant, whose shot-selection during the series has drawn significant criticism but who continues to be backed for his match-winning potential.Team India are expected to stick with the trio of Nitish Reddy, Ravindra Jadeja, and Washington Sundar for the SCG Test. After R Ashwin's retirement, the spin-bowling all-rounder department has felt his absence, but Sundar's recent form has provided some relief.Alongside Sundar, Jadeja's consistent bowling performances have ensured his place in the XI, despite his struggles with the bat. Nitish Reddy also seems certain to feature again, rounding out India's balanced all-round combination.Jasprit Bumrah, in the absence of Rohit, will captain the team. It rekindles the memories of his remarkable captaincy in the Perth Test, where his leadership and fiery bowling secured India an early 1-0 lead in the series.Mohammed Siraj, having taken 16 wickets, is already third on the list of top wicket-takers in BGT. However, whether India choose to go with Harshit Rana or Prasidh Krishna in the Team India XI is anyone's guess.Yashasvi Jaiswal, KL Rahul, Shubman Gill, Virat Kohli, Rishabh Pant, Nitish Reddy, Ravindra Jadeja, Washington Sundar, Harshit Rana / Prasidh Krishna, Jasprit Bumrah, Mohammed Siraj","Rohit Sharma dropped for final Test against Australia at Sydney Cricket Ground.

Premier League chief expresses concern over how the Club World Cup might impact Manchester City and Chelsea,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/epl/top-stories/premier-league-chief-expresses-concern-over-how-the-club-world-cup-might-impact-manchester-city-and-chelsea/articleshow/116891226.cms,"Manchester City (PTI Photo)

Richard Masters , the Premier League's chief executive, has voiced concerns about the scheduling of the Club World Cup . He believes it could pose significant challenges for Manchester City and Chelsea 's preparations for the 2025/26 Premier League season.The expanded 32-team tournament, hosted by the United States, will feature both English clubs. Players' unions are considering legal action due to welfare concerns, and national leagues are worried about the impact on their own competitions.The Club World Cup final is scheduled for July 13th, 2025, while the Premier League season kicks off on August 16th.“The leagues and the players' unions are not happy with the decisions that are being taken at a global level.”Masters expressed his concerns to Sky Sports, highlighting the tight turnaround between the two competitions.“We've seen the Club World Cup come in, and obviously that is going to have an impact on the Premier League.”He explained the potential conflict between the Club World Cup schedule and players' contractual right to a three-week break.“If either Manchester City or Chelsea get to the final of that competition, the Premier League starts four weeks later, and all players are supposed to have three weeks off as part of the contractual commitment.”Masters questioned how this scheduling clash could be resolved.“So how does that work? With great difficulty I would say.”Shifting his focus to the financial state of English football , Masters dismissed suggestions of an impending crisis. He reiterated the Premier League's concerns about the possible ramifications of an independent regulator.During the 2023/24 season, the Premier League incurred legal costs exceeding £45 million ($56 million) defending its rules against challenges from clubs.Further significant legal expenses are anticipated this season due to the ongoing disciplinary case against Manchester City.The reigning champions face over 100 alleged breaches of the Premier League's financial rules, with charges brought in 2023.An independent commission concluded its hearings between September and December, and a verdict is now awaited.Manchester City has also contested the legality of the league's associated party transaction (APT) regulations. These regulations are designed to ensure fair market value in deals involving organizations connected to a club's ownership.Both the current and previous British governments have advocated for an independent regulator. The goal is to ensure the financial stability of clubs in the top five tiers of English football.However, Masters argued that excessive regulation could stifle the excitement that fuels the Premier League's success.“We have that jeopardy, we have that constant fizz of compelling entertainment.”He attributed the Premier League's global appeal to various factors, particularly its unpredictable nature.“There are many different reasons (for the Premier League's global popularity) but that, I think, is what separates us from others.”Masters emphasized the importance of investment in maintaining the league's competitive balance.“We have always been pro investment within measured risks. The Premier League is not a pension fund, it is a place where capital is put at risk. There is no certainty of outcome -- that is one of the things that makes it interesting.”He expressed apprehension that an independent regulator might prioritize risk aversion, hindering clubs' investment capacity.“We do worry that a new regulatory function might be risk-averse and might inhibit clubs' ability to invest. And the ability to invest is key to competitive balance, and that jeopardy that I'm talking about.”",Premier League chief executive Richard Masters has voiced concerns about the scheduling of the Club World Cup.

Liverpool and Manchester United , once English football's fiercest rivals, face each other at Anfield on Sunday. The two teams are currently on very different trajectories.Liverpool is at the top of both the Premier League and the Champions League . They aim to match Manchester United's record of 20 Premier League titles, and potentially achieve even more. In the last seven years, Liverpool has only lost once to United in the Premier League. Their most recent encounter was a 3-0 victory for Liverpool at Old Trafford in September.Manchester United finds itself closer to the relegation zone than the top of the table. This season has been another difficult one, marked by the departure of a manager and sporting director, and the sidelining of a key player.The growing disparity between the two clubs is stark. Liverpool is vying for a quadruple of trophies, while Manchester United is battling to avoid relegation. This begs the question: how did two of England's most successful teams end up on such divergent paths?Manchester United's decline has been evident since their record 20th title win in 2013, Alex Ferguson's final season as manager. The club hasn't come close to winning the league since his retirement. Ruben Amorim is the sixth permanent manager appointed in the past eleven years.David Moyes, Louis van Gaal, Jose Mourinho, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, and Erik ten Hag have all been unable to achieve consistent success at United. The constant managerial changes have hindered the club's progress, leading to frequent shifts in direction.Amorim has quickly grasped the scale of the challenge, having overseen six defeats in his last eight games. He acknowledged the possibility of a relegation battle this week.“It is a possibility,” he said. “We have to be clear with our fans.”While Manchester United has struggled to replace a legendary manager, Liverpool's transition appears to have been seamless.Arne Slot took on the challenging task of succeeding Jürgen Klopp at the end of the last season. He has since propelled the team to new heights.Klopp achieved significant success at Anfield, winning a complete set of trophies. His only obstacle to further Premier League titles was Pep Guardiola's Manchester City.Under Slot, Liverpool currently leads the Premier League by six points with a game in hand. They also hold a three-point lead in the Champions League and have reached the semi-finals of the English League Cup.Slot may have benefited from Manchester City's decline this season. However, Liverpool's record of 14 wins from 18 league games is impressive in any season.Manchester United has spent billions on player transfers, yet costly mistakes have outnumbered successful acquisitions.High-profile signings like Angel di Maria, Alexis Sanchez, Paul Pogba, Casemiro, and Jadon Sancho have failed to meet expectations. Recent additions, including Joshua Zirkzee and Matthijs de Ligt, have also struggled.If Amorim wants to bring in new players in January, he might have to sell some existing ones. Marcus Rashford, recently dropped from the team, could be a valuable asset to generate funds.In contrast, Liverpool has been one of the most astute operators in the transfer market in recent years. Their significant expenditures have generally been wise, with players like Virgil van Dijk and Alisson becoming key figures in their trophy wins. Mohamed Salah and Andy Robertson were acquired for relatively modest fees.Under the ownership of Fenway Sports Group (FSG), the American conglomerate that also owns the Boston Red Sox, Liverpool has regained its prominence in English and European football, ending a 30-year wait for a Premier League title.Klopp's appointment was crucial to this success, but so was the contribution of sporting director Michael Edwards. Edwards played a key role in numerous successful transfers. He left in 2022 but has returned as FSG's chief executive of football and has helped to manage the transition to Slot.Manchester United's American owners, the Glazer family, have faced consistent fan protests since their leveraged buyout of the club in 2005.Last year, British billionaire Jim Ratcliffe made a minority investment in the club, which generated some optimism. He took charge of the club's football operations, but things haven't gone as planned.Erik ten Hag was dismissed just months after signing a contract extension, and sporting director Dan Ashworth left after less than six months. The signings made during Ratcliffe's first summer transfer window also appear questionable, with United currently 14th in the league, just seven points above the relegation zone.Liverpool is having an excellent season, but significant challenges remain.Mohamed Salah, Virgil van Dijk, and Trent Alexander-Arnold's contracts expire at the end of this season. Salah and Van Dijk are in their thirties, and there's disagreement over the length of the contracts Liverpool is willing to offer them. Alexander-Arnold has reportedly attracted interest from Real Madrid.Amorim's immediate priority is to improve Manchester United's performance. In the long term, his current squad seems ill-suited to his preferred playing style.","Liverpool and Manchester United are once English football's fiercest rivals.

Tough Start for Ruud

NEW DELHI: Germany made a strong start on Sunday in defending their United Cup title, with world number two Alexander Zverev and Laura Siegemund securing victory over Brazil, eliminating the South Americans from the mixed-team tournament.Zverev sealed the win with a commanding 6-4, 6-4 performance against Thiago Monteiro, following Siegemund’s gritty 6-3, 1-6, 6-4 triumph over Beatriz Haddad Maia, who is ranked 17th, 63 places above her.The result in Perth knocked Brazil out of group play after an earlier defeat to China.Germany now faces China on Monday, with the winner advancing to the quarter-finals.In Sydney, women’s world number four Jasmine Paolini cruised past Belinda Bencic 6-1, 6-1 in just 57 minutes, ensuring Italy’s victory over Switzerland.Meanwhile, men’s world number six Casper Ruud endured a tough battle against Tomas Machac but couldn’t prevent Norway’s loss to the Czech Republic.Zverev set the tone against Monteiro by breaking serve in the opening game of each set, wrapping up the 80-minute contest without facing significant pressure. It marked an unusual position for Germany, who often relied on deciding mixed doubles matches in last year’s tournament.""This is the first time we've ever been up 2-0,"" Zverev said. ""Last year, I played deciding (mixed doubles) matches every time.""It's nice to have this (tie) in the bag. I'm very happy to be playing for Germany again.""Siegemund battled for over two and a half hours to outlast Haddad Maia.After a dominant first set, the German faltered in the second but regained composure in a tense final set, winning after three consecutive service breaks and sealing the match on her first match point.Paolini’s strong form carried over from her stellar 2024 season, which included runner-up finishes at Roland Garros and Wimbledon. She overpowered Bencic, who is making a comeback after maternity leave.""I played a really good match. Today everything worked really well,"" said Paolini.""I was serving and returning well, and I think that was the key.""Earlier, Flavio Cobolli defeated Dominic Stricker 6-3, 7-6 (6/2), giving Italy an initial lead.Meanwhile, Ruud, the highest-ranked Norwegian in history, faced a grueling match against Machac. After nearly three hours, Ruud emerged victorious 7-6 (7/6), 5-7, 6-4, leveling the tie 1-1 after Karolina Muchova’s dominant 6-2, 6-2 win over Malene Helgo.However, Ruud opted out of the deciding mixed doubles due to left quad discomfort. Machac and Muchova capitalized, defeating Viktor Durasovic and Ulrikke Eikeri 6-4, 6-4 to secure the Czech Republic’s win.""You kind of hope that it won't be that tough, but what a way to start the new season,"" said Ruud, who banked 2024 tournament wins at Geneva and Barcelona.""If every match is going to be this tough, it's going to be a tough (season).""Ruud’s concern may grow as he faced nine break points during the match, despite his early control in the third set.","World number two Alexander Zverev and Laura Siegemund secure victory over Brazil.

'It was for all the supporters': Ishan Kishan on animated celebration after scoring hundred

NEW DELHI: Ashutosh Sharma stood firm, kept his composure, and unleashed his batting firepower when it mattered the most, guiding Delhi Capitals to a thrilling last-over victory against Lucknow Super Giants in their IPL 2025 opener at the Dr. Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy ACA-VDCA Cricket Stadium in Visakhapatnam.The young batter roared in celebration, swinging his bat and gesturing animatedly toward the Delhi Capitals dugout after sealing a breathtaking chase.Ashutosh was the hero of the night, smashing an unbeaten 66 off just 31 balls, rescuing his side from the brink of defeat and steering them to a stunning one-wicket win.Earlier, Lucknow Super Giants put up a formidable total of 209/8 in 20 overs, powered by Mitchell Marsh ’s explosive 72 off 36 balls and Nicholas Pooran ’s blistering 75 off 30. Despite their efforts, LSG couldn't keep Ashutosh from scripting a memorable turnaround.Delhi Capitals’ chase got off to a nightmare start as they crumbled to 7/3 within two overs, with Shardul Thakur and Manimaran Siddharth wreaking havoc. Jake Fraser-McGurk, Abishek Porel, and Sameer Rizvi fell cheaply, putting DC on the back foot.Captain Axar Patel (22 off 11) and Faf du Plessis (29 off 18) tried to rebuild, but DC still found themselves struggling at 113/6 in the 13th over, requiring 97 runs off just 45 balls.That’s when Ashutosh turned the game on its head.Displaying a perfect balance of composure and controlled aggression, he took on the LSG bowlers fearlessly, dispatching five boundaries and five towering sixes. His calculated counterattack kept DC alive in the chase.Vipraj Nigam provided vital support with a quickfire 39 off 15 balls, building a game-changing partnership with Ashutosh that reignited Delhi’s hopes.With 18 runs needed off the last two overs, Ashutosh kept his nerve, expertly maneuvering the strike and punishing loose deliveries. Despite losing Kuldeep Yadav in the penultimate over, he remained unfazed.Then, with just a few runs required, Ashutosh finished things off in style—launching a stunning straight six off the third ball of the final over, sealing an unforgettable win for Delhi Capitals and etching his name as the hero of the night.","Delhi Capitals beat Lucknow Super Giants by one wicket in their IPL 2025 opener.

LSG in IPL 2025: Rishabh Pant to lead Lucknow Super Giants in bid for first title

IPL: How will GT, LSG, DC, PBKS, RR fare? Greenstone Lobo predicts

Lucknow Super Giants owner Sanjiv Goenka met with Rishabh Pant for a discussion following Lucknow Super Giants' defeat to Delhi Capitals in their IPL 2025 opening match. Goenka-owned LSG had acquired Pant for a record sum of Rs 27 crore during the mega auction.LSG had DC struggling at 113 for six while defending 210 runs but couldn't secure the victory. Ashutosh Sharma's outstanding performance of 66 not out from 31 balls guided DC to victory with one wicket and three balls remaining in Visakhapatnam.Pant's debut as LSG captain was underwhelming across all aspects of the game. He scored a duck from six balls, falling to Kuldeep Yadav, in a high-scoring match where five batters achieved strike rates above 200.His leadership decisions were questioned, particularly regarding Shardul Thakur's limited use. Despite taking two wickets in his first over, Thakur only bowled two overs in total.With 22 runs needed from the final two overs, Pant chose inexperienced Prince Yadav over Shardul. Prince conceded 16 runs, including two fours and a six.In the last over, with just a run per ball required, Pant opted for left-arm spinner Shahbaz Ahmed instead of the experienced Shardul, who has previously secured victories for India in similar situations.A crucial stumping opportunity was missed by Pant in the final over. Though Shahbaz beat Mohit Sharma with an excellent delivery, Pant failed to collect the ball after it deflected off Mohit's back pad.""Definitely luck plays a part in this game and if it could have missed his (Mohit Sharma's) pads, it was a chance for stumping. But these things happen in the game of cricket, you can't focus on these things, but rather you need to play better cricket,"" Pant stated during the post-match presentation.Following the match, Goenka seemingly had a conversation with Pant and coach Justin Langer. While less intense than his previous discussion with former captain KL Rahul in IPL 2024, it served as a subtle reminder for Pant to improve his performance.Delhi's chase began poorly at 7-3 in the second over. The situation worsened when they lost five wickets for 65 runs, including Faf du Plessis who scored 29 in his first match for the team.DC captain Axar Patel contributed 22 runs quickly, while Tristan Stubbs added 34 to the chase.",Lucknow Super Giants owner Sanjiv Goenka met with Rishabh Pant following their defeat to Delhi Capitals in their IPL 2025 opening match.

We had a good camp in Dharamsala, where we got to know a lot of our Indian players, and we're very excited about the talent we have. They're very athletic, they're going to be a brave, brave cricket team,"" he said.With Ricky Ponting as head coach and Iyer at the helm, Punjab Kings have placed a strong emphasis on building a cohesive and dynamic unit.

I think we've got experience right through,"" he added.Haddin also praised the leadership of captain Shreyas Iyer, crediting him for fostering a culture of unity and commitment within the team.""I think the culture is driven from our leaders. We have a very driven captain in Shreyas Iyer who has had a lot of success in this format of the game. He has brought everyone together. The staff is on the same page as the players. We are a really tight group, but it's been led by the standards and the habits that the captain sets,"" Haddin said.",Punjab Kings take on Gujarat Titans in their IPL 2025 opener on Tuesday.

Former India opener Navjot Singh Sidhu , speaking as a JioStar expert during the ongoing IPL, showered high praise on MS Dhoni and Virat Kohli , calling them not just cricket icons but ""institutions"" in their own right. During a media interaction, Sidhu discussed their legendary status, leadership qualities and the immense impact they’ve had on the game across generations.""People call them icons. I call them institutions,” Sidhu remarked passionately. “Virat Kohli's name will stay for generations. Dhoni's name will stay for generations. Why? For stamping their supremacy throughout the world over a period of time with longevity and adapting to all formats, the attitude of a lion, right?”Sidhu highlighted Kohli’s charisma and his global influence, drawing parallels between Kohli and cricket legends of the past. He compared Kohli to Mansoor Ali Khan Pataudi, noting their ability to fill stadiums with their mere presence.""And someone with his charisma and magnetism has eclipsed across the globe. Across the globe, he is a great role model. The kids in the street want to be Virat Kohli. That's the kind of impact,"" Sidhu said.Turning to Dhoni, Sidhu did not hold back his admiration, particularly emphasising his leadership qualities and the respect he commands even at the age of 43.""Somewhere down the line, if you look at Dhoni, the best captain that India has ever produced by miles. The one who makes the world move. A leader is the one who moves forward. Man's rank is his ability to uplift. The one who instills faith in those who follow him. The one who makes ordinary people extraordinary,"" Sidhu asserted.He was particularly impressed by Dhoni’s recent wicketkeeping display, where the veteran cricketer’s lightning-quick stumping left fans and pundits in awe.""He is 42 (43) years old, friend. Look at the way he did that stumping. It was greased lightning yesterday. I mean, a young man will not be able to do it. How he inspires people,"" Sidhu exclaimed.Sidhu noted that Dhoni’s larger-than-life presence transcends the game itself, as opposing teams eagerly gather to interact with him after Chennai Super Kings matches, showcasing his unparalleled stature.","Former India opener Navjot Singh Sidhu was speaking as a JioStar expert during the ongoing IPL.

'He handled it superbly': Paras Mhambrey on Vignesh Puthur's dream debut vs CSK

Suspense over

continues

NEW DELHI: Mumbai Indians lost their opening match of the Indian Premier League 2025 against Chennai Super Kings at Chepauk on Sunday and the side left for Ahmedabad the next morning. With their next fixture against Gujarat Titans still a few days away, the Hardik Pandya-led unit will be spending a couple of rest days in Jamnagar for team bonding activities before preparations for the next game take over.It wasn't an ideal start for a depleted Mumbai unit as they went down to CSK in their season opener. On a sluggish surface, the team never got going with the bat and didn't have enough runs on the board to challenge the opposition. They will be bolstered by the return of regular captain Hardik Pandya , who missed the opening game due to a slow-over rate penalty from last season.Pandya did travel with the team, hit some lusty blows in the nets and his presence was felt as MI missed his all-round abilities against Chennai. Suryakumar Yadav led the side in his absence but wasn't able to make a substantial contribution with the bat.Rohit Sharma too was dismissed for a duck and the only positives for MI in that game were the contributions made by Deepak Chahar and instant impact of Vignesh Puthur . The 24-year-old chinaman returned with three wickets and showed no signs of pressure whatsoever on the big stage, in front of a packed crowd.There is no return date for Jasprit Bumrah yet but Mumbai Indians bowling coach Paras Mhambrey said that he is making good progress, and the MI management is in constant touch with the medical team overseeing his rehabilitation at the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) Centre of Excellence (CoE). Mhambrey asserted that the seamer has been an integral part of MI for years now and continues to be a valuable asset for the side.","Mumbai Indians lost their opening match of the Indian Premier League 2025 against Chennai Super Kings at Chepauk on Sunday.

SRH in IPL 2025: Sunrisers Hyderabad target title with big-hitting players

The controversial remark came after Klaasen hit consecutive boundaries against Archer.""London me kaali taxi ka meter tez bhaagta hai, Aur yaha pe Archer sahab ka meter bhi tez bhaaga hai (In London the black cabs meter runs fast and here the meter of Archer runs fast),"" said the former India spinner in commentary.The comment sparked outrage on social media, with fans demanding Harbhajan's immediate removal from the IPL 2025 commentary panel.Archer had a difficult debut in IPL 2025, conceding 76 runs without taking any wickets against Hyderabad.

MI in IPL 2025: After wooden spoon, Mumbai Indians target better show

IPL 2025: How will KKR, MI, CSK, SRH, RCB fare this season?

TimesofIndia.com in Chennai: Four players made their Indian Premier League debut in the Chennai Super Kings vs Mumbai Indians clash at Chepauk on Sunday but it was the little-known Vignesh Puthur who made a splash in front of a packed house. The 24-year-old chinaman bowler , son of an auto driver, from Malappuram in Kerala was the latest dispatch from MI's scouting stable, and the youngster made instant impact with 3/32 against a star-studded CSK outfit.Puthur's journey to MI's blue and gold is a fascinating one as he was picked up at the auction for Rs 30 lakh after an impressive show in the franchise's trials. Amongst the many who had assembled, Puthur caught the attention with his accuracy, consistent turn and ability to keep a cool head under pressure. It was enough to raise the paddle and from there on, the management chalked out a plan to groom the inexperienced spinner who had very little exposure at the higher level.The MI Cape Town unit was set to assemble in South Africa for the SA20 in January and Puthur was summoned as a net bowler and spent a lot of time working on his skills with the likes of Rashid Khan. The invaluable experience of rubbing shoulders with the greats of the game did his confidence a world of good and he even played three games for the Reliance team in the DY Patil T20 tournament before the pre-season preparations got underway.In the nets, during match simulations and practice fixtures, the management led by head coach Mahela Jayawardene were convinced to give the boy an early chance in the IPL and feedback from Rohit Sharma and Suryakumar Yadav also pushed his case.""Rohit, Surya, Tillak, all these guys batted against him (in the nets)... it wasn't easy that easy (to pick him). So one of the reasons we felt that we have the confidence of pushing him in this game. And it turned out to be excellent. It was a good decision,"" said MI bowling coach Paras Mhambrey .He lavished praise on the scouting team, who unearthed Puthur from the Kerala Cricket League, for unearthing a talent like him and further explained what they look for when picking these youngsters.""We have good guys who can spot talent. I think the idea with MI is seeing the potential more than anything else. And when we saw him for one of our trials, we saw the potential in him. Rather than looking into how much cricket he's played in the past. But it's purely thought that he has the potential. And you saw that today,"" added Mhambrey.Amidst deafening whistles and chants, Puthur returned with the wickets of Ruturaj Gaikwad, Shivam Dube and Deepak Hooda but what impressed the MI dugout the most was his ability to hold nerves and handle the pressure. It was something they had worked on behind the scenes and the regular conversations with coaches Mahela, Kieron Pollard and senior players like Rohit helped Puthur understand his role, expectations of the team and the culture of the MI dressing room.""Yes, he hasn't played much cricket. But we got an opportunity where he worked a little bit. Got an opportunity to work with him after we had a couple of trials. Not purely on the skill work so much really. I think that he is pretty much sorted out there I feel. But more about the conversations that he had an opportunity with MJ. Or Pollard. Or the batters, especially Surya and Rohit. I think that really helped with him in understanding the requirements. And understanding his role in the team. And what we expect out of him,"" explained Mhambrey.Sharing the dressing room with India and overseas stars, having a post-match chat with MS Dhoni is the stuff dreams are made of, and Puthur lived that on Sunday night. The social media traction sky-rocketed in lightning quick time but the bowling coach asserts he is a ""sweet kid"" just soaking it all in ""like a sponge"".""He's a lovely kid to have in the team. He's more like a sponge right now, just absorbing everything, looking around, you know, having conversations. I thought not everyone gets an opportunity in a dressing room to get an opportunity to chat with MJ, someone who has so much experience. Surya, Tilak, Rohit, you know, all these guys. He's just listening.""You have heroes, you see them playing on the TV, and all of a sudden you're sharing that dressing room with them, sitting next to someone like Rohit. It's a dream come true for a lot of these guys, right? But purely the way he responded... never looked like he was under pressure from the very first ball. And that was good to see,"" says Mhambrey.The first impression has been a good one and now everyone in the MI dugout would hope it turns out to be a long and successful innings like their previous boy wonders - Jasprit Bumrah, Hardik Pandya, Krunal Pandya, Tilak Varma - who went on to become household names.",Vignesh Puthur made his IPL debut against Chennai Super Kings on Sunday.

SRH in IPL 2025: Sunrisers Hyderabad target title with big-hitting players

RR in IPL 2025: Rajasthan Royals hope for first title in 17 years

Brief scores: SRH 286/6

beat RR 242/6

by 44 runs.

Hyderabad: Ishan Kishan made a sensational debut for his new team on Sunday. A stunning maiden, unbeaten 106 (47b, 11x4, 6x6) by the southpaw set up last year’s runners-up Sunrisers Hyderabad ’s 44-run win over Rajasthan Royals Courtesy the blitzkrieg, SRH racked up the league’s second-highest total of 286/6, just shy of their record of 287/3 they set against Royal Challengers Bengaluru last season. SRH now have the most 250+ totals — four — in IPL . Chasing an imposing target, the visitors, who played into SRH’s hands by inviting them to bat first on a belter, finished at 242/6.Ishan, whose first reaction after being acquired by SRH for Rs 11.25 crore at the mega auction was to call SRH opener Abhishek Sharma and ask what was expected of him, said 300 crossed his mind. “In the middle someone came with the message saying that we have to achieve that target. I said I didn’t know we had a target in mind. But, it is good posting such big totals,” said Ishan.Sunday’s innings could well prove a giant first step for Kishan’s return into national reckoning, after a couple of bleak seasons that may have forced introspection and a rekindling of ambition. It was such a rollicking start to his SRH stint that even the Rajasthan Royals batting coach Vikram Rathour had words of appreciation — “when someone scores a century of that kind, there is everything to like about it.”Kishan later said that the flying kisses after reaching his century were meant for his fans and his brother — Raj Kishan — who was in the stands. The SRH No. 3 credited the team management for his hurricane knock. “It was important for me to gain confidence from the start. The captain is so supportive, and the coach is on the mark. He told me that if the ball is in my slot, I should go for it. That sort of confidence from your team captain is a big boost,” Ishan said later.He justified coach Daniel Vettori’s faith by sending the Rajasthan bowlers on a leather hunt after SRH’s opening duo of Travis Head and Abhishek Sharma smashed 45 runs in 3.1 overs before Sharma was dismissed by Maheesh Theekshana.Head plundered 23 runs (4x4, 1x6) off Jofra Archer’s first over, as the Englishman had the ignominy of returning the worst figures in the league. His none for 76 eclipsed Mohit Sharma’s none for 73 for Gujarat.Kishan and Head took the hosts to 94/1 in the Powerplay and galloped past 100 in 6.4 overs. Head reached his fifty off 21 deliveries, but two overs later he departed hitting straight to Shimron Hetmyer off Tushar Deshpande. Head and Kishan added 85 off 39 balls as the hosts reached 135/2 at the halfway stage. Kishan and Nitish Kumar Reddy (30 off 15b, 4x4, 1x6) never took their foot off the pedal.Kishan clobbered Archer for three sixes in the 13th over and another off Farooqi as the hosts reached 200 in the 15th over.

As it happened:

NEW DELHI: Afghanistan's mystery spinner Noor Ahmad made an unforgettable debut for Chennai Super Kings (CSK), claiming a sensational four-wicket haul to script a memorable four-wicket win over Mumbai Indians (MI) in their IPL 2025 opener at the MA Chidambaram Stadium, Chennai, on Sunday.Ahmad’s figures of 4 for 18 were not only the best by any CSK spinner against MI but also pivotal in restricting the visitors to a modest 155/9 on a typically slow Chepauk surface.In a match that continued MI's unfortunate streak of not winning their opening game since 2012, Noor Ahmad was the undeniable game-changer. His spell broke the backbone of MI's batting, leaving them struggling to gain any momentum. After Khaleel Ahmed (3/29) struck early by dismissing Rohit Sharma for a duck and Ryan Rickelton for 13, Ahmad took over the middle overs with his deceptive variations.The highlight of Ahmad’s spell came when he dismissed MI's stand-in captain Suryakumar Yadav (29 off 26) with a lightning-quick stumping by MS Dhoni , who showcased his evergreen reflexes behind the stumps. Dhoni’s brilliance not only highlighted his continued prowess but also underlined Ahmad’s skill to fox the batter with a well-disguised delivery.Ahmad followed it up by trapping Tilak Varma (31 off 25) with a googly and dismissing Robin Minz and Naman Dhir in quick succession. The MI middle-order was left in tatters as Ahmad's wizardry spun them into disarray.Despite Deepak Chahar’s late resistance with a fiery 28 off 15 balls, MI could only muster 155/9, a total that never looked threatening.Chasing 156, CSK got off to a steady start, anchored by skipper Ruturaj Gaikwad, who smashed 53 off 26 balls before falling to IPL debutant Vignesh Puthur (3/32). Puthur briefly troubled CSK with his left-arm spin, removing Gaikwad, Shivam Dube and Deepak Hooda in quick succession. However, Rachin Ravindra’s unbeaten 65 off 45 balls ensured CSK’s march towards victory.The crowd erupted when MS Dhoni walked out to bat with just four runs needed, but it was Ravindra who sealed the win with a towering six, as CSK reached the target in 19.1 overs.With this victory, CSK extended their dominance over MI, having won six of the last seven head-to-head encounters since the second leg of IPL 2021.","Chennai Super Kings (CSK) beat Mumbai Indians (MI) by four wickets in their IPL 2025 opener at the MA Chidambaram Stadium, Chennai, on Sunday.

NEW DELHI: In a moment that lit up Chepauk and sent social media into a frenzy, MS Dhoni once again proved why age is just a number.The 43-year-old wicketkeeper pulled off a stunning stumping to dismiss Mumbai Indians ’ captain Suryakumar Yadav , leaving fans and commentators in awe of his reflexes and presence behind the stumps.The dismissal came in the 11th over of MI’s innings when Suryakumar looked to up the ante against debutant spinner Noor Ahmad.Trying to take on the left-arm wrist-spinner with an ambitious inside-out lofted drive, SKY was beaten in the flight.The ball spun away sharply, and before his bat could even complete its arc, Dhoni had already whipped the bails off with a swift, textbook gather and a sharp forward push -- hallmarks of his legendary glovework.Watch:Suryakumar's 29-run stay was ended in a flash, and Dhoni’s magic had once again turned the tide.The stumping wasn’t just quick; it was clinical, cold, and classic Dhoni.

LSG in IPL 2025: Rishabh Pant to lead Lucknow Super Giants in bid for first title

In a thrilling IPL 2025 match in Visakhapatnam, Lucknow Super Giants captain Rishabh Pant remained composed about a crucial missed stumping opportunity against Delhi Capitals .Ashutosh Sharma emerged as DC's hero with an unbeaten 66, leading his team to victory when the odds were against them. In the final over, with six runs needed from six balls, Pant chose Shahbaz Ahmed to bowl.The first ball of the final over saw Mohit Sharma step down the track and miss, with Pant failing to complete the stumping. Although Pant opted for a DRS review for LBW, the ball was shown to have missed the stumps.Mohit managed a single, bringing Ashutosh on strike. The 26-year-old then sealed the match with a six over Shahbaz's head, securing a one-wicket victory for Delhi Capitals.""Definitely, luck plays a part in this game, and if it could have missed his (Mohit Sharma's) pads, it was a chance for stumping. But these things happen in the game of cricket. You can't focus on these things, but rather, you need to play better cricket.""After winning the toss and choosing to field, DC faced a strong batting display from LSG. Mitchell Marsh scored 72 while Nicholas Pooran contributed 75, helping their team post a total above 200 runs.""I think our top-order batters played really well, and I think it was a pretty good score on this wicket. As a team, we are looking to take positives from every match, and as a team, we are looking to learn from it (every match.) The more basics we do right, the more it is going to be better for us in the future. We got early wickets, but we knew it was a good wicket to bat on. We had to keep doing the basics right more often than not.""DC's chase began poorly as they struggled at 65/5 in the seventh over. However, several crucial partnerships turned the game around.The partnerships included a 55-run stand between Ashutosh and Vipraj Nigam (39), 45 runs between Tristan Stubbs and Ashutosh, and 43 runs between Axar Patel and Faf du Plessis.""I think they had a couple of good partnerships. One with Stubbs, one with Ashutosh and one with one other guy (Vipraj Nigam.) I think he (Nigam) did a pretty good job and took the game away from us. There was enough for the bowlers, but I think we could have done the basics right.

'You don’t get more pressure than playing for India': Glenn Phillips on Shubman Gill

Mumbai Indians (MI) batter Rohit Sharma is hailed by fans and experts for his selflessness and desire to put the team ahead of personal milestones. Another Indian cricketer who adopts the same attitude in all aspects of the game is none other than Rajasthan Royals (RR) captain Sanju Samson , as evident from an anecdote shared by former India pacer Tinu Yohanan .""Sanju was in poor form during the 2021/22 season of the Vijay Hazare Trophy . I advised him that he would be able to get a big score if he faces a certain number of deliveries. Sanju said, 'That is not the kind of player I am. I won't play for myself in any scenario',"" said Yohanan, who was the head coach of the Kerala cricket team at that point, during an exclusive interaction with TimesofIndia.com.The former Indian pacer further highlighted Samson's desire to win at any cost as evident from his approach and mentality while leading Kerala in a Ranji Trophy group stage match against Rajasthan back in December 2022.""We were handed a daunting target of 395 runs in the second innings with the conditions quite bowler-friendly. While most captains attempt to go for a safety-first approach, Samson emphasised on looking to chase down the target. He set an example for the rest of the team, scoring 69 runs off 53 balls. We eventually finished pretty close to the target, scoring 299 runs which seemed pretty daunting before the chase began,"" said Yohanan.""Sanju is the ultimate team man and has gone out of his way on many occasions to defend his teammates. Players like Salman Nizar and Mohammed Azharuddeen, who impressed during the recently concluded edition of the Ranji Trophy, got quality support from him when they were struggling. Sanju has always been very approachable and generous,"" he added.","Rajasthan Royals captain Sanju Samson is the ultimate team man, says former India pacer Tinu Yohanan. Samson was in poor form during the 2021/22 season of the Vijay Hazare Trophy when he was advised to get a big score.

NEW DELHI: Punjab Kings will kick off their IPL 2025 campaign against Gujarat Titans on Tuesday, with Shreyas Iyer leading the charge in his first match as captain. The franchise, still searching for its elusive maiden title after 18 years, hopes Iyer’s proven leadership will inspire a turnaround. Iyer previously guided Kolkata Knight Riders to an IPL title and took Delhi Capitals to the final in 2020, making him an ideal candidate to revitalise Punjab’s fortunes.Punjab Kings have struggled to make an impact in recent seasons, failing to break into the top five in the last four editions. Their best performances came in 2014, when they finished as runners-up, and in 2018, reaching the semifinals. The franchise’s decision to appoint Iyer as captain marks a fresh approach, complemented by a reunion with coach Ricky Ponting , with whom Iyer has shared past successes.Both captains come into the match in excellent form following their performances in India’s recent Champions Trophy victory in Dubai. Iyer topped the run-scoring charts with 243 runs in five matches, while Gujarat Titans’ skipper Shubman Gill showcased his prowess with a century against Bangladesh.Gujarat Titans, who won the IPL title in 2022 and finished as runners-up in 2023, struggled under Gill’s captaincy last season, finishing eighth. Determined to bounce back, the Titans have assembled a formidable lineup, with Gill and Jos Buttler opening the batting and a solid middle order comprising Sherfane Rutherford, Sai Sudharsan, and Masood Shahrukh Khan. The all-round strength of Rashid Khan, Rahul Tewatia, Glenn Phillips, Washington Sundar, and Mahipal Lomror adds depth to their squad.The Titans’ bowling attack looks potent with Mohammed Siraj, Kagiso Rabada, Prasidh Krishna, Gerald Coetzee and Ishant Sharma in the pace department. Spin duties will be shouldered by Rashid Khan and Sai Kishore.Punjab Kings, on the other hand, will rely on Iyer, Josh Inglis, Prabhsimran Singh, Marcus Stoinis and Glenn Maxwell to anchor their batting. The team’s all-round depth includes Azmatullah Omarzai, Stoinis, Marco Jansen, Shahank Singh, and Musheer Khan. Arshdeep Singh will spearhead the pace attack, supported by Lockie Ferguson, Kuldeep Sen, and Yash Thakur. Spin responsibilities rest on Yuzvendra Chahal and Harpreet Brar.This season opener represents a crucial opportunity for both teams to set the tone for their campaigns. Punjab Kings will aim to overcome their historical struggles, while Gujarat Titans look to make a strong statement after last year’s disappointing finish.Shubman Gill (c), Anuj Rawat, Jos Buttler, Kumar Kushagra, Sherfane Rutherford, Sai Sudharsan, M Shahrukh Khan, Rashid Khan, Karim Janat, Mahipal Lomror, Glenn Phillips, Nishant Sindhu, Manav Suthar, Rahul Tewatia, Washington Sundar, Arshad Khan, Gerald Coetzee, Gurnoor Brar, Kulwant Khejroliya, Mohammed Siraj, Prasidh Krishna, Kagiso Rabada, Sai Kishore, Ishant Sharma, Jayant YadavShreyas Iyer (c), Priyansh Arya, Pyla Avinash, Harnoor Singh, Josh Inglis, Prabhsimran Singh, Vishnu Vinod, Nehal Wadhera, Azmatullah Omarzai, Aaron Hardie, Marco Jansen, Glenn Maxwell, Musheer Khan, Shashank Singh, Marcus Stoinis, Suryansh Shedge, Arshdeep Singh, Xavier Bartlett, Yuzvendra Chahal, Praveen Dubey, Lockie Ferguson, Harpreet Brar, Kuldeep Sen, Vijaykumar Vyshak, Yash Thakur.",Punjab Kings will kick off their IPL 2025 campaign against Gujarat Titans.

Travis Head also played a crucial role, smashing 67 off 31 balls as Sunrisers picked up right where they left off last season. Their total of 286/6 is now the second-highest in IPL history, just behind their own record of 287/3 against Royal Challengers Bengaluru in 2024.Interestingly, Sunrisers Hyderabad now holds the top three highest totals in IPL history.Impressed by their explosive start to the season, Steyn—who represented Sunrisers Hyderabad from 2013 to 2015—took to social media with a bold prediction:""Small prediction.

Shillong: When Shillong hosted its first-ever international match last Wednesday, less than 7,000 fans in this football-crazy region turned up at the JN Stadium to watch India clinch their first international win in 12 games, and the first since November 2023.The first taste of international football in Meghalaya was in stark contrast with the three Indian Super League matches played here, each of which garnered over twice the footfall for the FIFA friendly.Interestingly, the largest crowd was for NorthEast United FC’s match against Bengaluru FC — with fans filling up the venue to see Sunil Chhetri in action. But the veteran’s comeback in India colours inspired very few live-viewing enthusiasts.Even Shillong Lajong owner Larsing Ming , who has long been associated with Meghalaya and Indian football , couldn’t fathom the contrast, reluctantly attributing it to a probable “lack of awareness” for the fixture.However, locals are optimistic, and the picture is expected to be very different for India’s AFC Asian Cup Qualifier against Bangladesh on Tuesday with officials confirming that ticket sales have been quite high and are expecting the match tickets to be sold out by Monday.Arki Nongrum, the founder of sports management firm ISMG, told TOI on Sunday that his firm is working with the Meghalaya govt to facilitate the fixtures. “A lot of people are just eager to watch a Premier League player in action, like Hamza Choudhury,” he said of the local enthusiasts, who are huge followers of English football and would be there to see the Sheffield United player, on loan from former EPL champions, Leicester City, play live.","Shillong hosted its first-ever international match last Wednesday.

Paris: Holders Spain beat the Netherlands on penalties after a dramatic quarter-final second leg in Valencia finished 3-3 on Sunday to set up a Nations League last-four clash with France, who edged Croatia in a shoot-out after a 2-2 aggregate draw.On a dramatic night, Portugal battled past Denmark in extra time and will next face Finals hosts Germany after their tense 5-4 aggregate victory over Italy.European champions Spain took the lead in the tie, after Thursday's 2-2 first-leg draw, when Mikel Oyarzabal picked himself up after being fouled in the box to slot home an early penalty.The Netherlands equalised nine minutes into the second half as Memphis Depay also won and then netted a spot-kick.Oyarzabal grabbed his second in the 67th minute after a strong run forward by Nico Williams, only for the Dutch to level again with 11 minutes remaining through Ian Maatsen's fierce strike.Lamine Yamal struck shortly before the interval in extra time, though, curling the ball into the far corner after a couple of superb touches.There was yet another twist as Spain goalkeeper Unai Simon brought down Xavi Simons, who picked himself up to score.Spain edged home 5-4 in the shoot-out despite a miss from Yamal, as Simon saved from Netherlands winger Donyell Malen and Pedri struck the winning penalty.""We're Spain and we don't have to fear anyone,"" Pedri told TVE of facing 2021 Nations League winners France in the semi-finals in Stuttgart on June 5.France wiped out a two-goal deficit against Croatia at the Stade de France.Michael Olise's brilliant free-kick broke the deadlock on the night in the 52nd minute, before Ousmane Dembele swept Olise's cutback into the bottom corner to send the quarter-final to extra time.Theo Hernandez missed a penalty to win it for France in an eventful shoot-out, but Dayot Upamecano eventually secured a 5-4 success on penalties in sudden death.""We woke up thinking it could be a great night,"" Kylian Mbappe told TF1. ""We were convinced we were going to do something great.""Portugal, inspired by substitute Francisco Trincao, battled back after losing the first game 1-0 to win a thrilling last-eight encounter with Denmark 5-3 on aggregate. Cristiano Ronaldo , after a stuttering run-up, produced the tamest of early penalties which was comfortably held by Denmark goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel.Portugal were gifted the lead on the night when Joachim Andersen put through his own net.But the Danes restored their aggregate advantage 11 minutes into the second half through Rasmus Kristensen's excellent header.Ronaldo did get his 136th international goal, though, turning the ball in after Schmeichel tipped Fernandes' shot against the post.But Portugal were caught out in the 76th minute when Christian Eriksen tapped home.The hosts managed to force an added half-hour when Schmeichel's weak punch fell to Mendes, who teed up Trincao to drill a shot into the bottom corner.Trincao netted his second in the first minute of extra time and Goncalo Ramos secured a meeting with Germany in Munich on June 4.Julian Nagelsmann's Germans survived an Italy comeback to win 5-4 on aggregate after a 3-3 draw in Dortmund.Germany extended their overall advantage on the half-hour mark when Joshua Kimmich tucked home a spot-kick before playing a key role in a bizarre second goal.Italy goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma left his goal after making a save to complain at the referee and Kimmich took a quickly-taken corner which was flicked into an empty net by Jamal Musiala.Tim Kleindienst nodded in Kimmich's clipped cross on the stroke of half-time, but Moise Kean scored twice to give Italy a glimmer of hope heading into the last 20 minutes.Giacomo Raspadori converted a penalty in injury time to equalise on the night, but there was not long enough left for the Azzurri.""A football game is never perfect, but it was some unbelievable football, and the best I've seen us play,"" Germany coach Nagelsmann said.Elsewhere, Belgium narrowly avoided relegation to League B as two late goals from Romelu Lukaku helped them overturn a 3-1 first-leg deficit against Ukraine with a 3-0 victory.",Holders Spain beat the Netherlands on penalties after a dramatic quarter-final second leg in Valencia finished 3-3 on Sunday.

Argentina moved closer to securing their spot in the 2026 World Cup after defeating Uruguay 1-0 in Montevideo on Friday, thanks to a brilliant goal from Thiago Almada.The match appeared to be heading towards a draw against Uruguay, who had previously defeated Argentina 2-0 in Buenos Aires during the qualifying rounds.The decisive moment came when Almada, the 23-year-old attacking midfielder, received the ball on the edge of the area and unleashed a powerful shot into the top corner, beyond Uruguay goalkeeper Sergio Rochet's reach.Argentina's otherwise strong performance was slightly marred in stoppage time when Nicolas Gonzalez received a red card for a dangerous high boot challenge on Uruguay's Nahitan Nandez.Argentina coach Lionel Scaloni expressed satisfaction with his team's performance, particularly in Messi's absence due to injury.""How can I not be satisfied? Not just for the result -- but for how they gave it their all. The satisfaction comes from the fact that the team played a complete match. When one player is missing, another comes in (...) we have enough to go out onto the field calmly, but the team is there.""Argentina can become the first South American team to qualify for the 2026 World Cup in the United States, Canada and Mexico if they defeat Brazil in Buenos Aires on Tuesday.Argentina currently leads the South American qualifying group with 28 points from 13 games, followed by Ecuador in second place with 22 points and Brazil in third with 21 points.Uruguay holds fourth position with 20 points from 13 matches, just ahead of Paraguay on goal difference.The victory guarantees Argentina at least a seventh-place finish, ensuring them a minimum of an inter-confederation playoff spot, with the top six teams qualifying directly for the World Cup.In another South American qualifier, Ecuador strengthened their qualification chances by defeating Venezuela 2-1, with veteran striker Enner Valencia scoring both goals.Ecuador is pursuing their fifth World Cup appearance in the nation's history.Ecuador's coach Sebastian Beccacece commented on the team's performance while emphasizing the importance of staying focused.""When things are going well, like today when we've won three games in a row, we have to be cautious, calm, humble, and have a lot of discipline to continue growing in what's coming up.""","Argentina defeated Uruguay 1-0 in Montevideo on Friday. Thiago Almada scored the only goal of the game. Argentina can qualify for the 2026 World Cup in the United States, Canada and Mexico.

PANAJI: The All India Football Federation ( AIFF ) has told NorthEast United FC that Kerala Blasters cannot be punished for fielding Dusan Lagator, who had a pending suspension at the time of his transfer from Hungarian club Debreceni VSC to India.NorthEast had appealed with FIFA’s dispute resolution chamber.A January signing, the Montenegro midfielder was a second-half substitute against NorthEast in their goalless draw in Kochi and served his suspension in the next game against East Bengal.“There is no violation from either the club or the federation,” AIFF secretary general P Anilkumar told TOI on Friday. “NorthEast’s protest has been overruled. As per our records, there is no violation.”The AIFF swung into action after being informed by FIFA that the dispute between NorthEast and Blasters was of a “national dimension, the eligibility of a player in a competition falling under the auspices of AIFF.”","Kerala Blasters cannot be punished for fielding Dusan Lagator, who had a pending suspension at the time of his transfer from Hungarian club Debreceni VSC to India.

PANAJI: Hamza Choudhury ’s arrival in Bangladesh earlier this week, sparked a never-before frenzy for a footballer in south Asia. The midfielder’s car was mobbed by supporters, everyone wanted a piece of him, a touch, a selfie, good enough even if he caught the eye. And there was so much Hamza had to do, including, among other things, a meeting with the adviser for Youth and Sports to the Interim Government.All this, before the team left for India for the opening group clash of the Asian Cup 2027 final round qualifiers on Thursday.Hamza, 27, you could say, is no ordinary footballer. No Lionel Messi, but with 57 Premier League appearances for Leicester City until Januay this year, he’s the highest profile footballer to represent a south Asian country in internationals.Until his loan move to Championship side Sheffield United in January, the Foxes academy graduate was the only British Asian playing in the Premier League in over two decades. Zesh Rehman, of Pakistani origin, was the first British Asian to start a Premier League match, turning out for Fulham in 2003.The Birmingham-born Rehman chose to represent hosts Pakistan at the 2005 SAFF Championship — a tournament where incidentally, a 20-year-old striker called Sunil Chhetri made his international debut for India.Rehman went on to make 22 appearances for the Pakistan national team, even captaining the side. On Thursday it was a similar feeling towards the east of the region.“It feels like our Messi is here,” Bangladesh captain Jamal Bhuyan told reporters during the team’s official media briefing prior to Thursday’s departure. “The excitement is five times greater than when I first arrived. Hamza is a Premier League player, it’s a huge boost for us,” added Bhuyan.Bhuyan’s own story is equally fascinating. After showing promise as a junior in Denmark, he was on the verge of breaking into the senior team when he was caught in the crossfire of gang-related gunfire in the Danish capital, a bullet hitting his head and putting him into coma.His career slowed down, and in 2013, he eventually returned to Bangladesh. Five years later, he rose to become captain. Hamza is even more special. Born to a Grenadian father and a Bangladeshi mother, Hamza made seven appearances for England Under-21s and chose to represent Bangladesh in senior international football , thanks to his ancestry. The defensive midfielder is expected to make his international debut against India in Shillong on Tuesday.India go into the fixture on the back of a 3-0 friendly win against the Maldives on Wednesday. There were two goals from set-pieces; Rahul Bheke scored in his second successive game, Liston Colaco scored his first in India colours, but more importantly, Sunil Chhetri, coaxed out of retirement at 40 by coach Manolo Marquez, showed just why he can still be counted to deliver.For Bangladesh, who would have been watching closely, it’s Hamza who they are counting upon.“You can’t compare Sunil Chhetri to Hamza. Sunil has done great things for India, but let’s be honest, Hamza is a Premier League player,” said Bhuyan, the poster boy of Bangladesh football, until Hamza’s arrival.At 185th, Bangladesh is the lowest-ranked team in the Asian Cup 2027 qualifiers group, which also has Hong Kong and Singapore. But Hamza’s inclusion has raised hopes of qualification to the continental showpiece for the first time.“One player cannot fully change one team, but it’s true that Hamza’s inclusion has raised expectations around the national team,” former Bangladesh national team coach Oscar Bruzon told TOI.Now with East Bengal, Bruzon spoke of the edge Hamza’s presence adds.“When you have a player from the Premier League, the standards rise and the players around you are motivated to do their best. The advantage for Bangladesh is more psychological,” he said.Bruzon is no stranger to football in Bangladesh. In the five years that he spent there, he won the Bangladesh Premier League four times with Basundhara Kings and, in addition to his club duties, took charge of the national team.“Bangladesh has strong players (physically), but they are missing a little bit of creativity in the middle. Hamza can play centre-back or defensive midfield, but I think they will try and bring him forward (more). There will be changes in some patterns of play. He is definitely of a different level, so everyone will have to adapt and adjust on the pitch.“Hamza will be very motivated,” pointed out Bruzon. “The craze is un - believable. I don’t think adaptation will be difficult because Bangladesh already has some technically good players. Tariq Kazi (Finland), for example, is young and talented defender. They are looking for others too playing in higher leagues.”","Hamza Choudhury is the highest profile footballer to represent a south Asian country in internationals.

SHILLONG: Despite the first win in 2025, and one after 489 days, all is not well in the Indian camp.Late on Wednesday, Manolo Marquez was a worried man even after securing his first win after becoming India coach in July. Unable to pick the injured Lallianzuala Chhangte and Asish Rai for this FIFA window, Marquez will now miss winger Manvir Singh and midfielder Brandon Fernandes for the crucial AFC Asian Cup qualifier against Bangladesh here on Tuesday.While Manvir — in fine form for 2024-25 ISL Shield Winners Mohun Bagan Super Giant — was released from the squad ahead of the Maldives friendly that India won 3-0, Marquez said Brandon, too, is certain to miss the Bangladesh tie.“Brandon won’t be available, for sure. It’s really bad luck that we lost three players — in the last game of the ISL, Manvir on Tuesday during the break session and today Brandon,” he said after the game on Wednesday.One of the more influential players against Maldives till he was stretchered off from the ground in the 39th minute, Brandon also delivered the corner for Rahul Bheke’s opening goal on Wednesday.The Mumbai City attacking midfielder went down to the ground in great pain at the half-hour mark, before being able to carry on for only another 10 minutes. Marquez did not want to take any risk, and had Brandon substituted with Chennaiyin FC striker-winger Farukh Choudhary.The player was later seen with a heavily strapped knee.Brandon’s unavailability forces the coach now on finding an able replacement ahead of Tuesday’s competitive clash.“We will call someone. We will recover Brison, who was in the stands, but let’s see which player,” he said.Brison Fernandes, who had a fine season at FC Goa under Marquez himself, missed the Maldives tie with a minor injury. Marquez did not want to risk aggravating the niggle, but with Brandon out, he could step in after regaining match fitness in in the interim week.A contender for the ISL Emerging Player Award, the 23-year-old midfielder has seven goals and two assists in 22 appearances this season. With passing accuracy and a fine possession game, Brison has the ingredients to graduate into an asset under Marquez.Aiming for their third consecutive appearance in the Asian meet, India are clubbed with Hong Kong China, Singapore and Bangladesh in Group C of the qualifiers. With only one team progressing from each group, a winning start will be crucial to India’s fortune.",India beat Maldives 3-0 in a friendly in Shillong on Wednesday.

- 'Not to mock him' -

COPENHAGEN: Rasmus Hojlund earned Denmark a deserved 1-0 lead over Portugal in their Nations League quarter-final first leg clash on Thursday. The Manchester United forward delivered from the bench to split the teams in Copenhagen, providing the finishing touch Denmark previously lacked on a night where they dominated Roberto Martinez's side.The Spanish coach selected veteran Cristiano Ronaldo , 40, up front but the Al-Nassr striker was mostly frozen out of the game.Winners of the inaugural tournament in 2019, Portugal are aiming to become the first team to lift the Nations League trophy for a second time.However they will need to improve swiftly to reach the semi-finals as Denmark outclassed them and could have scored more on the night, with Christian Eriksen missing a penalty.""It was our worst performance in the last two years,"" Portugal coach Martinez admitted, speaking to RTP.""After a five-month break, we clearly didn't come out with the intensity we needed. Denmark's pressure was very effective.""We lacked a lot. We lacked intensity... the level of our performance is not at the level we expected.""Looking for their first win under coach Brian Riemer, who was appointed in October, the Danes were without injured captain Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg.Denmark piled on the pressure from the start, with debutant Mika Biereth charging down Diogo Costa's clearance, but the goalkeeper managed to escape with conceding only a corner.Jesper Lindstrom forced Costa into action again with an effort from distance, while Pedro Neto tested Kasper Schmeichel at the other end.The hosts won a penalty when Portugal defender Renato Veiga handled the ball but Costa produced a superb save to deny Eriksen.The Porto goalkeeper, an expert in saving spot kicks, dived low to his right to thwart the Manchester United midfielder.Costa made another stunning save from Biereth to keep his team level, as Denmark turned the screw.When the hosts finally beat Costa, Diogo Dalot was in the right place at the right time to clear Eriksen's effort off the line just before the break, after good work by Gustav Isaksen.Riemer's side stayed on top in the second half, with Costa saving an Eriksen free-kick, although Vitinha came close for Portugal, who showed occasional flashes of their quality on an otherwise lethargic display.Isaksen, a constant menace, had a shot deflected behind as Denmark started to fear their dominance would not translate into a lead. However Hojlund, on as a substitute, had other ideas.The striker, who ended a long Manchester United drought last weekend by scoring in his team's win at Leicester City, broke the deadlock by slotting home to cap a fine move.Eriksen spread the ball to another substitute, Andreas Skov Olsen, who picked out Hojlund with a low ball to finish coolly in the 78th minute.The forward imitated Ronaldo's jumping ""Siuuu"" celebration but said it was a tribute to the former Man United and Real Madrid superstar.""I'm playing against the world's best footballer, my idol, and to score and become the (match) winner, it couldn't be better,"" Hojlund told Denmark's TV2.""It was not to mock him or anything, I've always said he has had great importance for me and my football career.""Portugal's Bernardo Silva, making his 99th appearance for his country, had a penalty appeal late on waved away after falling under pressure from Patrick Dorgu in the box, and Schmeichel saved from Neto in the final stages.Portugal host Denmark in the second leg in Lisbon on Sunday.""Pressure is part of football, now it increases because we're one goal down, but we have time to correct that,"" Costa told RTP.""Everything is still up for grabs and we have to focus on that to give a reaction (to this defeat).""",Denmark beat Portugal 1-0 in their Nations League quarter-final first leg clash.

Alexandra Eala , a 19-year-old tennis player from the Philippines, achieved a historic victory at the Miami Open on Sunday by defeating Australian Open champion Madison Keys .This win marked a significant milestone as Eala became the first Filipino woman to defeat a top-10 ranked player since the ranking system's inception 50 years ago.The emotional victory saw Eala celebrating with her team, embracing them while fighting back tears.""It's a big thing to take in, and I feel it's important for me to take it in step by step. I'm so super proud of what I was able to accomplish, but it definitely fuels me more.""""I know and it's in my mind that I have a next match, but I need to stop, and I need to recognise that what I did today was really amazing.

Of course, my family should take credit for the foundation that they laid out before they sent me there.""""But of course, the academy was able to build on that foundation in such a way that I'm able to be where I am now. And I think the combination of everything that I've been through since I started tennis is what has led to this moment and what has led to me having all these opportunities.""The decision to move to Europe was made easier as her brother Miko also joined the academy.""It was definitely a big decision for me, for us. As soon as I heard that, I jumped at the opportunity because I knew that I had to get out of the country eventually to improve.""Eala's tennis journey began with her grandfather, a club player who coached her brother and cousins before focusing on her development.""I was kind of the next in line to do that and to spend time with him. It eventually blossomed into the career I have now.""Her victory came shortly after fellow Nadal Academy member Coleman Wong from Hong Kong defeated American 13th seed Ben Shelton in Miami.""I'm super happy for him and to see someone that I've known so long do so well is definitely an inspiration. Not just to me, but I feel in general a lot of people can take inspiration from him.""Despite her success, Eala maintains a humble perspective about being a role model for young players in the Philippines.""The young kids, the youth in the Philippines, they don't need to take inspiration from me.

BENGALURU: Vedant Mohan -- India’s most promising sub-junior tennis player (under-14) – has kickstarted the next step of his junior career, transitioning to the International Tennis Federation’s junior Tour (under-18).The 14-year-old, who had been locked down at his training base in Javea, a coastal town in Spain since February, started by playing a couple of base-level ITFs in Sri Lanka these last weeks. He's scheduled for more J30s and J60s in May, most likely in Africa.Vedant, left-handed, also plays on the Spanish circuit and has gained immensely in the last few years competing in Tennis Europe events alongside some of the best under-14 talents in the world. Vedant’s highest ranking in the under-14 section of the Tennis Europe ratings was achieved on his 14th birthday this January, when he still had another 12 months left in the age-group.He was ranked No.13 and at the time, the only Asian in the top 25.While playing in Europe helped grow Vedant’s game, the 5-feet-8-inch Indian couldn’t play the full circuit. He didn’t qualify for the European Championships, the Summer or Winter Cups, all big-ticket competitions, and open only to Europeans as they are team events.That, along with the fact that he was cash-strapped, contributed to Vedant’s rather limited matchplay in comparison to his peers (2011-born) who were ranked higher than him.For instance, the TE No.1 (U-14) Mario Vukovic of France has played 176 singles matches and the No.2 Greece’s Rafael Pagonis played 192 while Vedant has played just 102.The 14-year-old will now play a mix of U-16 and U-18 tournaments in Spain, while targeting ITF under-18s. Vedant’s parents – father Dhruv and mother Anisha – moved to Spain five years ago when their son, then nine, received a tennis scholarship.Mohan, a commercial pilot, has for most part funded Vedant’s mushrooming career, while also leaning on Anisha’s and his family back home in India. He lives in Muscat, while Anisha and their two sons live in Javea, where Vedant trains under Javier Ferrer, brother of former top-5 pro David.Vedant, who idolises tennis legend Novak Djokovic because of his mentality, says his favourite surface is clay.“I love that I can rip the ball hard and heavy with topspin on clay. Also, I love to slide,” he told TOI. “My favourite shot is my inside-out forehand. I like to play aggressively, my game is all court. I like to volley and also play with variation.”Mohan, a collegiate-level tennis player in India, winning gold medals in singles and doubles, is hoping his son will be part of junior Grand Slam draws in the next 18-to-24 months.“The ultimate goal is the pros, the ATP Tour,” he said, adding, “At this stage we’re only looking to develop his game.”","Vedant Mohan is India’s most promising sub-junior tennis player (under-14) The 14-year-old will now play a mix of U-16 and U-18 tournaments in Spain.

Miami: Carlos Alcaraz , ranked world number three, experienced an unexpected early elimination from the Miami Open on Friday. Belgian veteran David Goffin secured a remarkable comeback victory with a score of 5-7, 6-4, 6-3 at Hard Rock Stadium .Goffin, aged 34 and currently ranked 55th, had previously defeated Alcaraz in Astana three years ago. Noticing Alcaraz's subpar performance in the opening set, Goffin adopted an aggressive approach.Goffin, who once achieved a career-high ranking of No.7 in 2017, delivered impressive winning shots while Alcaraz struggled with unforced errors. The Belgian player managed to secure a break advantage in all three sets, and despite losing his lead in the first set, he maintained composure to secure the victory.""When I came out earlier... just to warm up on the court, I felt 'I'm moving well. I'm feeling quite relaxed. I'm hitting the ball really well' and so I hoped it would be the same during the match.""""I started the match well. I had the break in the first and he started to play really well at the end of the first.""""It's that kind of night that I will remember for sure -- against Carlos and in a stadium like that. And the night that gave me a lot of confidence to continue.""Daniil Medvedev also faced an early exit following a 6-2, 6-3 loss to Spain's Jaume Munar, ranked 56th. Meanwhile, Novak Djokovic secured a straight-sets victory over Australian Rinky Hijikata.Medvedev, who won the Miami title in 2023, displayed frustration by throwing his racket multiple times. Munar, the 27-year-old from Mallorca, achieved his third career victory over a top 10 opponent.The Russian player committed 32 unforced errors and failed to convert two break points in the final game despite having an opportunity to mount a comeback.""Yeah, I was not 100% physically, but I tried my best to get into the match. Every day was better and better. I had some problems after Indian Wells. Can happen.""""He played well, so that's why (he won) I wouldn't go to the match if I would kind of definitely know I'm not ready to win.""Djokovic, who previously lost to a lucky loser at Indian Wells, defeated 86th-ranked Hijikata 6-0, 7-6 (7/1), ending his three-match losing streak. He has now matched Rafael Nadal's record of 410 match wins in Masters 1000 tournaments since their inception in 1990.Karen Khachanov halted Nick Kyrgios's comeback with a 7-6 (7/3), 6-0 victory. Kyrgios, returning from wrist surgery, had secured his first tour-level win since October 2022 against Mackenzie McDonald but couldn't overcome Khachanov, a semi-finalist in Miami last year.In the women's competition, world number two Iga Swiatek advanced to the third round by defeating France's Caroline Garcia 6-2, 7-5. The match proved more challenging than their recent encounter at Indian Wells.Swiatek faced a 3-1 deficit in the second set and saved a set point while serving at 5-4 down before winning the final three games.""My energy level got down really fast. So I tried to wake myself up, keep the intensity from the first set, follow through and go for it,"" Swiatek said.Emma Raducanu demonstrated determination in her victory over eighth-seeded American Emma Navarro.

Miami:

Australian Nick Kyrgios won his first match since 2022 as he fought back from a set down to beat American Mackenzie McDonald 3-6, 6-3, 6-4 at the Miami Open on Wednesday.Kyrgios's career has been blighted by injuries in the last two years and he had to retire from his first round match at Indian Wells earlier this month.The flamboyant 29-year-old had suffered pain in his surgically reconstructed right wrist - a procedure that left him on the sidelines for 18 months.""It has been a long journey, even to just get to the start line of matches and be scared to just finish them,"" Kyrgios said.""To come off and get a win and feel like I belong again was special,"" added after the one-hour, 43-minute victory.Kyrgios, the 2022 Wimbledon finalist, has been plagued by injuries in his career but it was the wrist which caused him the most serious issues and he said he was deeply pessimistic about his chances of a comeback.""I never thought I would play tennis again to be brutally honest with you. I was having conversations with my camp and my team, and I said 'I don't know how long I can keep doing this for',"" he said.""This (win) puts some petrol in the tank but I need to be realistic and see how my wrist feels tomorrow because it is a grind out here,"" he added.There was a first round win for 38-year-old Frenchman Gael Monfils who became the second oldest man, after Jimmy Connors, to win at the Miami Open.Monfils beat last year's quarter-finalist, Hungary's Fabian Marozsan, 6-3, 3-6, 6-4.In the women's draw, Emma Raducanu claimed her first win, defeating 19-year-old wild card Sayaka Ishii of Japan 6-2, 6-1 in just 65 minutes.The 2021 US Open champion will face eighth-seeded American Emma Navarro in the second round, her first meeting with a top 10 player since losing to Iga Swiatek in the Australian Open third round.""It's going to be an extremely challenging match,"" Raducanu said in her on-court interview.

It was difficult today, a lot of nerves in the match.""Draper ended Alcaraz's 16-match winning streak at Indian Wells. He dominated the first set in 23 minutes as Alcaraz struggled against his left-handed serve.The second set saw a complete reversal as Alcaraz improved his game. After saving a break point with a 137 mph ace in the opening game, he broke Draper's serve three times to level the match.""It was a strange match in all honesty. Carlos came out a little flat, I sensed that. I had a chance in the first game of the second, and he came up with an ace... What happened to him happened to me, I got tight, I had low energy. I got lost out there for 25 minutes, but in the third, I was really proud of my competitiveness, my attitude and I somehow managed to get over the line.""In the third set, Draper broke Alcaraz for a 2-1 lead following a lengthy video review.

If you hit hard to him, he likes the pace and he responds well to being in the defence and hitting strong back. So I tried to make it difficult for him. I tried to mix it up, making every shot that he has to play annoying for him. Slices, slow slices, some mixing the tempo, hitting hard on some, looping some.""The first set saw an early exchange of breaks before Rune held serve at 4-4.

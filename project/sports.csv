Harvansh Singh Pangalia's Instagram bio reads - ""Trying to do better.""A self-confessed Marvel fan, Harvansh takes inspiration from Tobey Maguire's Spider-Man 2, a 2004 movie where Peter Parker first meets the brilliant Otto Octavius. The scientist says, ""You’re Dr. Connor’s student. He tells me you’re brilliant. He also tells me you’re lazy."" Peter’s response is as simple as it is necessary: “Trying to do better. ”""There's something about that scene, that dialogue. Then they repeated the same dialogue 20 years later in 'Spider-Man: No Way Home.' The answer gives me goosebumps,"" Harvansh told TimesofIndia.com from Hove.In the practice match against Young Lions Invitational XI, the 18-year-old showcased his explosive batting prowess with a whirlwind century. Walking in at 251/7, he smashed a rapid 100 off just 52 balls, including nine sixes, propelling India to a massive total of 442/9.In the last 24 hours, Harvansh's friends and family have shared a number of reels and memes featuring him, in which he has been touted as India's next batting sensation.His videos of six-hitting are all over social media feeds.The teenager still doesn't know how he managed to play such a jaw-dropping knock.""I was struggling. The first five balls I faced, I was all at sea, failing to connect a single one. I was batting on 13 off 23 balls. I was just not able to find the gaps, and I was getting frustrated. But then something happened. Something snapped, aap keh sakte ho ki maata aa gayi (you could say I was possessed!),"" Harvansh laughed.Harvansh hails from Gandhidham, a small town in Gujarat's Rann of Kutch. Growing up, he saw his father, Damandeep Singh, and uncle, Kunwarajeet Singh, who played cricket in their town, and interestingly, both of them were wicketkeepers. Now, his family, including his father, is settled in Canada, while Harvansh stayed back in Gandhidham with his mother. Harvansh's father moved to Canada in 2017 and is a truck driver.A couple of years ago, Harvansh visited his father in Brampton. The idea was to spend some quality time with him, but he hardly got to because of his work shifts.""He gets up early at 2:30am as his shifts start at 4am; then he comes back in the evening. We hardly got time to spend with him,"" he said.""Whenever I step out to bat, I see the faces of my mother and father. One lives in Gandhidham, while the other is in Brampton. I feel so bad for my mother. She stayed back so that I could live my dream. They have sacrificed so much for me,"" Harvansh added.Harvansh has promised his father that one day he will bring him back to India. Damandeep shares the confidence in believing that his son will play for India, but like any desi father, he is trying to save money for his son's future if cricket doesn't work out.But little does Damandeep know about his son's mentality. He is determined to reunite his parents, and he feels nothing is going to come in his way.""I admire Yuvraj Singh . I adore his mentality about how he won the World Cup for the country while battling cancer,"" said Harvansh.""The sportsperson I liked the most is the late Kobe Bryant. His Mamba Mentality. No athlete can match his work ethic. He used to train for six to eight hours, which is so inspiring,"" he added.Harvansh feels that after reaching a certain level, it is not the skillset that helps an athlete but their mentality and self-belief. He vows to play Test cricket for India, and Virat Kohli's post-match interview after winning the IPL for RCB in Ahmedabad has a key role to play in it. Virat Kohli had said one can only earn respect by playing Test cricket.""Test ka naam test hai because it tests your character. I love playing four-day cricket. That's the ultimate cricket,"" he said.Harvansh's teammates Vaibhav Sooryavanshi and his India U19 captain Ayush Mhatre have already played in the IPL and have lucrative deals. Harvansh takes inspiration from the duo, but he is more focused on his own game.""They are my friends; Ayush is my best mate in the team. I am happy for them. They do inspire all of us, but everyone has a different path.""""Mera bhi time aayega (My time will come as well),"" he said.India U19 will take on England U19 in the first Youth ODI at Hove on Friday.","India U-19 cricketer Harvansh Singh scored 103 off 52 balls against England's U19 team.

Poll Do you think the Indian cricket team can bounce back in the remaining Tests against England? Yes, definitely! No, I don't think so. It depends on their performance.

The moment you step out of the Birmingham bus station, plenty of cab drivers yell out, ""paaji, paaji where (brother where to?)"". From the accent, you can make out they are not from India but for them, an Indian face with a beard, wearing shorts and mid-rise sneakers is ""paaji"". A quick right towards the city and there are plenty of industrial buildings with endless graffiti. The locals call it an ""urban scruff"" and the attention to detail in some of the artwork is commendable.The Indian cricket team will be camped in the city for 12 nights and will certainly feel at home because of the ""desi"" touch, and the regular ""paaji, paaji"" calls will certainly be the comfort notes they would be looking for after losing the series opener at Headingley by five wickets. It was a game which India dominated for most periods, it was a game where five India batters scored a ton, it was a game where Jasprit Bumrah picked a five-wicket haul but it turned out to be a game where England chased down a record total to go 1-0 up in the series.Questions raised, shots fired, plenty fired back and the same old script has started to play out, as early as the first Test of the five-match series.A series where Bumrah is expected to play only three Tests and very likely to miss the second game in Birmingham to manage his workload. The Plan B's have to swiftly move into action and when they do, Shubman Gill and Co. need to get their act together for what is going to be a tough road ahead.Coach Gautam Gambhir has maintained that a winning dressing is a happy dressing room. The wins haven't come in the last few Tests - just one in the previous nine - and this is where the players need to have their arms around each other. It is understood that the camaraderie and the mood in the change room is better than what it had been in the past and senior players like KL Rahul and Ravindra Jadeja are taking the lead in keeping the youngsters comfortable.Jadeja has found a new wingman in Kuldeep Yadav for his coffee runs and KL Rahul has been spotted spending a lot of time with the youngsters. He has been taking them out for meals in the evening and continues to hang around with Karnataka boys Karun Nair and Prasidh Krishna. Gill has come across as a very personable leader and while he learns and grows on the job, the acceptance is there and it's important it stays that way.It's no secret that the changing room in Australia wasn't the best place to be and the results not going the side's way further affected the situation. India can't afford a repeat of that in England, at least from a dressing room perspective. The players need to be focussed on the job at hand, and the dressing room vibe will only help them perform to the best of their abilities in the middle.This is a very young and inexperienced Indian squad. Most are playing Test cricket for the first time in this part of the world but they showed that they have enough ammo to keep firing at the opposition. The missed the shots they should have taken, spilled the opportunities which were there for the taking but would now look to take the learnings in their stride and keep the eyes locked on the target - at the Birmingham Test where the ""paaji, paaji"" chants will make them feel like home.","The Indian cricket team will be camped in the city for 12 nights and will certainly feel at home because of the ""desi"" touch.

Poll In your opinion, was Roston Chase's LBW decision justified? Yes, it was justified No, it was not justified

Leeds to Birmingham: On the road with TOI Sports

NEW DELHI: Not one, not two, but three controversial third-umpire decisions became major talking points during the first Test between West Indies and Australia at Kensington Oval in Bridgetown, Barbados. West Indies gained the upper hand on Day 2, with Australia at 92/4 in their second innings, leading by just 82 runs. The match has been punctuated by several contentious calls from third umpire Adrian Holdstock, impacting both sides over the two days.Australia were dismissed for 180 in their first innings, with West Indies replying with 190. The contest remains delicately poised, with Travis Head and Beau Webster currently at the crease for the visitors.The string of controversies began on Day 1 when Travis Head was ruled not out, despite replays suggesting the ball had carried cleanly to the wicketkeeper off Shamar Joseph’s bowling. The third umpire, however, said there was not enough evidence to confirm a clean catch.Another questionable moment came in the first over of Day 2, when Roston Chase survived an LBW appeal off Josh Hazlewood. Despite a clear spike appearing before the ball hit the bat, the third umpire gave the benefit of doubt to Chase.Chase went on to score 44 before falling to another contentious decision. He was adjudged LBW to Pat Cummins, and although he reviewed the decision citing a visible deviation near the bat, the original verdict was upheld.""I disagree with the decision, I disagree with the technology, I thought he hit that but somehow, it's worked against Roston Chase,"" commented Ian Bishop during commentary.""I feel sorry for the officiating team there, in my view that should clearly have been not out. I apologise to the officials, but I'm in total disagreement, as he [Chase] is in bewilderment. You see a deflection, a change of direction of the ball as it approaches the bat. If you've watched the game for long enough, you can see it. If you're new to the game, maybe you don't notice it.""The controversy didn't stop there. Shai Hope was given out caught behind by Alex Carey, even though replays appeared to show the ball may have touched the ground during the catch.Australia now face the task of building a solid partnership on Day 3 to wrest back control of the match.","The first Test between West Indies and Australia continues in Bridgetown.

Spotted in Leeds! Indian Cricket Team Hits the Streets Ahead of 1st Test vs England

Endless coffee runs



The Indian cricket team left for Birmingham from Leeds in a bus on June 25. The entire squad and members of the support staff boarded the coach which was going to cover the around three-hour journey to India's next destination in the Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy. Plenty of players travelled with their own pillows for the road trip. KL Rahul took this up a notch with a foldable mattress in the luggage compartment.Upon prodding, it became evident that the batter prefers to carry his own mattress for uniformity in sleep. Are there some health/fitness concerns? Not really. Most players in the squad don't like the hotel beds and Rahul's own arrangement means he doesn't have to deal with the softer hotel beds.The team reached bright and sunny Birmingham on Wednesday (June 25) afternoon. Jasprit Bumrah made a run to the grocery store nearest to the coach station for some essentials. For the rest, it was a day of settling in a luxury hotel.Right from the Champions Trophy in Dubai, head coach Gautam Gambhir and batting coach Sitanshu Kotak have been spotted together during the evening hours. Wednesday was no exception as the duo were spotted strolling around a famous spot in the city.Rest period continues and there are more player sightings in store as the second Test is still some time away.Coffee runs started in Leeds, will continue in Birmingham, move to London then to Manchester before the long summer culminates at The Oval. The players stepped out in groups for coffee in Leeds, meals and it was a regular feature before the series opener got underway at Headingley.The senior players in the setup have been regularly spotted with the youngsters during the time the team is not training or busy with the game.Even before boarding the bus to Birmingham, the likes of Kuldeep Yadav , Karun Nair, Dhruv Jurel, Yashasvi Jaiswal and fielding coach T Dilip ensured to stock up on caffeine before Rishabh Pant and Arshdeep Singh could do their magic with the beats on the bluetooth speaker.India didn't train on Wednesday, have an off day today but there is a possibility of cricketing activity resuming on Friday.",The Indian cricket team left for Birmingham from Leeds in a bus on June 25.

Poll Which team's bowling attack has impressed you the most so far in the match? Australia West Indies

– Controversial Dismissals –

NEW DELHI: West Indies’ pace attack once again exposed the fragility of Australia’s top order, reducing the visitors to 92 for four at stumps on Day 2 of the first Test at Kensington Oval on Thursday. After being bowled out for 190 — trailing by just 10 runs in reply to Australia’s first innings total of 180 — the home side kept the pressure on, leaving the match finely poised. Australia now lead by 82 runs with six wickets remaining, setting the stage for a tense third day.It was another action-packed day in Barbados, with 10 wickets falling following the 14 that tumbled on the opening day. But beyond the wickets, much of the focus was on controversial third-umpire decisions that left the West Indies camp visibly frustrated.Travis Head, known for his aggressive counter-attacking style across formats, will resume on Day 3 alongside all-rounder Beau Webster . All four West Indian bowlers used in Australia’s second innings struck once, keeping their side in the hunt.After going wicketless in the first innings, Alzarri Joseph made the breakthrough in the final session, trapping Usman Khawaja lbw. Shamar Joseph, who had set the tone on Day 1, endured a frustrating moment when Sam Konstas was dropped twice in the same over in the slips.But persistence paid off 20 minutes later when Konstas dragged a delivery back onto his stumps.Jayden Seales, who took five wickets in the first innings, struck again by dismissing Josh Inglis for the second time in the match — this time bowling him as the batter offered no shot.Australia's ongoing experiment with Cameron Green at number three continued to falter, as he edged medium-pacer Justin Greaves to first slip, departing cheaply once again.Earlier in the day, a 67-run partnership between West Indies skipper Roston Chase and wicketkeeper Shai Hope helped stabilize the innings after they slumped to 72 for five in the morning session. Debutant Brandon King, who contributed 26, was bowled shouldering arms to Josh Hazlewood.Controversy resurfaced shortly after lunch when Roston Chase — playing his 50th Test and making a return to the format after more than two years — was adjudged leg-before to Pat Cummins. Television umpire Adrian Holdstock made the call, despite replays suggesting Chase had edged the ball onto his pads.Holdstock was again in the spotlight when Shai Hope, on 48, was ruled out caught down the leg side by a diving Alex Carey , giving Webster his second wicket. Hope had nearly reached the pavilion, convinced he was out, but multiple replays indicated the ball may have touched the ground as Carey completed the catch. Despite this, Holdstock upheld the decision.Alzarri Joseph chipped in with an unbeaten 23, but the West Indies innings wrapped up soon after. Mitchell Starc finished as Australia’s most successful bowler with figures of 3 for 65.Commenting on the disputed dismissals, Starc said, ""We can only ask the questions.""""That's what we have the technology for. The questions have to be asked in that direction, not at the players.""Reflecting on the state of the match, Starc noted that the pitch was keeping things competitive.""Throughout the two days it's shown that if you bowl in the right areas there are enough chances (created),"" he said.""Even when the ball got older or was changed it still did some sideways stuff so the bowlers have been in the game throughout so far and that is likely to continue tomorrow.""","West Indies bowl Australia out for 190 on Day 2 of first Test in Barbados.

Poll Should Jofra Archer start in the second Test against India? Yes, he should be in the starting XI Only if he's fully fit

Nearly a day before England named their squad for the second Test against India, former international Stuart Broad and England star Jos Buttler strongly advocated for Jofra Archer ’s inclusion. Archer, who last played a Test match in February 2021, is now in line to make a sensational comeback at Edgbaston after being named in the squad on Thursday for the second Test at Edgbaston.Speaking on their YouTube podcastFor The Love of Cricket , Broad said,He (Jofra Archer) played for Sussex this week, has taken a couple of wickets and looks like he's building up. And all the rumors and talk around the press box is he comes in at Edgbaston and he playsArcher recently turned out for Sussex in a first-class fixture against Durham, marking his return to red-ball cricket after four years. While he picked up just one wicket, his rhythm and fitness have been encouraging signs for England’s management. Clips of his sensational return have also gone viral on social media.Buttler, too, was optimistic of Archer's chances to make the squad.Hopefully he'll come through that game. He's playing up at Chester-le-Street unscathed. Looks like he's bowling well and he's actually put together a real bank of cricketHe also noted the importance of Ben Stokes being available as a bowler, which could help manage Archer's workload.And one of the big things for Jofra's workload that will help him I think is obviously Ben Stokes playing a fully fit part, you know, as that fourth seamer. Even if they don't pick him to play, it would just be fantastic to have him back around the group,added the Gujarat Titans player.Broad went a step further, backing Archer to start, sayingYeah, I think I play him, you know, I think if it was my decision, I'd play him… He's got a bouncer that makes everyone jump. So I'd be really, I'd be tempted to play him and I think every England fan would be buzzing if you saw Jofra Archer's name on that team sheetWith England taking a 1-0 lead after a stirring run-chase in Leeds led by Ben Duckett and Jamie Smith, Archer’s fiery pace could pose fresh questions for the Indian batting line-up in Birmingham.",Jofra Archer was named in England's squad for the second Test against India.

Al Nassr has announced a two-year contract extension with Cristiano Ronaldo that will keep him at the Saudi Arabian club until 2027. The announcement came on Thursday after months of uncertainty about his future.The 40-year-old star confirmed his commitment in a video released by the team where he stated: ""Al Nassr forever.""Ronaldo's arrival in 2023 sparked a trend, leading many established players in the latter stages of their careers to move to Saudi Arabia.There was speculation about Ronaldo's future when he posted ""This chapter is over"" after Al Nassr finished third in the Saudi Pro League without winning any trophies.""Ronaldo's presence is a key factor in developing the Saudi league in the last two years and a half. He opens the door for elite and young players to come to Saudi Arabia,"" said a source from the Public Investment Fund (PIF) to AFP.The Saudi PIF, which manages the country's sovereign wealth fund, oversees several Pro League clubs including Al Nassr, Al Hilal, and Al Ahli.The news of Ronaldo's extension follows Brazilian star Neymar's departure from Al Hilal in January.Neymar's brief 18-month stint saw him play only seven matches while earning a reported $104 million annually.Despite being the league's top scorer with 25 goals, Ronaldo has yet to secure any Saudi or continental titles with Al Nassr. The team recently lost in the Asian Champions League semi-finals.The five-time Ballon d'Or winner had previously mentioned the possibility of ending his career with Al Nassr, a team popular among Saudi royals.Saudi Arabia has transformed its football landscape by investing heavily in European talent, beginning with Ronaldo's transfer in late 2022. The country is also set to host the 2034 World Cup.Saudi football enthusiasts have enjoyed watching prestigious players like Ronaldo and Karim Benzema, who collectively hold six Ballons d'Or, during regular league matches.Some observers have drawn parallels between the Saudi Pro League and the Chinese Super League, which previously attracted players with high salaries before facing financial difficulties.The Saudi Pro League's development aligns with the country's broader goals of becoming a tourism and business destination before global oil demand decreases.Ronaldo initially joined Al Nassr two years ago in a deal reportedly worth $250 million, marking a significant shift in his career path to Saudi Arabian football.","Cristiano Ronaldo has signed a two-year contract extension with Al Nassr.

Poll Should India continue pursuing the opportunity to host the 2036 Olympic Games despite the delay? Yes, it's worth the effort No, they should focus on other priorities

What India are doing in Birmingham today, practice schedule, plan and more

India’s aspirations of hosting the 2036 Olympic Games have hit a temporary roadblock, with newly-elected International Olympic Committee (IOC) President Kirsty Coventry announcing a pause in the selection process for future hosts. Coventry, a former Olympic swimming champion from Zimbabwe and the first woman and African to lead the IOC, made the announcement on Thursday during an online press conference after her maiden executive board meeting in Lausanne.“There was an overwhelming support from the IOC members for a pause to be done and a review of the future host election process and we will be setting up a working group to look into this,” the 41-year-old said.A decision on awarding the 2036 Games, which was initially expected next year, will now be delayed as the IOC reconsiders its timeline and process for selecting host cities. Coventry cited the need for broader member engagement and a strategic reassessment of the timeline.“Firstly, members want to be engaged more in the process and secondly there was a very big discussion on when should the next host be awarded,” she said, as quoted by PTI.The IOC executive board emphasized the importance of learning from the experiences of upcoming hosts such as Los Angeles (2028 Summer Games), Brisbane (2032 Summer Games), and the French Alps (2030 Winter Games), all of which had varied timelines and challenges in their bids.“There was a lot of discussion on when is the appropriate time to elect a future host. And also how we should be selecting a future host,” she added.India had submitted a Letter of Intent for the 2036 Games in October 2023. A high-level delegation led by Sports Secretary Hari Ranjan Rao is expected to visit Lausanne next month for informal discussions. Coventry confirmed that the visit will go ahead.“We want all interested parties to be a part of this pause and reflect and of this review… They might be the first interested party for us to ask a couple of questions and to better understand from them,” she noted.She also acknowledged a glaring lack of representation from the Global South in past Olympic host selections. “I think the Global South, in terms of host cities, is not really represented at all. But my job is to ensure that policies are in place to allow anyone who has the ability to host the Games,” Coventry concluded.",Kirsty Coventry announces a pause in the selection process for future hosts.

Poll Should Jasprit Bumrah rest for the second Test in Birmingham? Yes, he should take a break. No, he should play to level the series.

Leeds to Birmingham: On the road with TOI Sports

IND vs ENG Series Schedule:

1st Test: England v India, 20-24 June 2025, Headingley, Leeds – England won by 5 wickets

2nd Test: England v India, 2-6 July 2025, Edgbaston, Birmingham

3rd Test: England v India, 10-14 July 2025, Lord’s, London

4th Test: England v India, 23-27 July 2025, Emirates Old Trafford, Manchester

5th Test: England v India, 31 July-4 August 2025, Kia Oval, London

Before they commence preparations for the second Test vs England from July 2, the Indian cricket team need to take that tough Jasprit Bumrah call. Well before the side arrived in the UK for the five-match series, it was decided that the ace seamer will only play three Tests to manage his body and workload.Which ones weren't revealed at that stage by chairman of men's senior selection committee Ajit Agarkar , and Bumrah maintained the three Test bit in an interview with Sky Sports without revealing too many details. So did head coach Gautam Gambhir during the post-match presser in Leeds.Bumrah sent down 44 overs during the Headingley Test and while the side is enjoying a two-day break in Birmingham, the team management, and the seamer himself, need to take that rest call. There is little turnaround time between the second and third Test and there will be a strong temptation to play him at Lord's from July 10. If he continues to play at Birmingham, playing the third Test goes out of the window because there will be only a four-day gap before he wears the whites again.Taking a cue from the schedule and Gambhir's comments in the press conference, there is a bright possibility of the second Test being the break fixture for the star seamer.The head coach had said that the series scoreline will not affect which Tests Bumrah plays and misses, and that call will be taken based on his workload as they need to manage him better for the cricket which is ahead of them.Former India head coach Shastri felt it could be a tough call to take as there will be a temptation to have him play in Birmingham, and level the series, and also have an eye at Lord's.“Bumrah said he'll play three Test matches. Now, which of the three he'll play, that's, you know, another question to be asked. I think if he takes a break, it'll be the next one, because he'll definitely want to play at Lord's, right? And there's a break, and then you go into Lord's, then there's a break, and then there's a choice between Manchester and the same. It could be 2-0 down. So that is the problem. I think he has got to play,” Shastri said on Sky Sports Cricket.But if the decision making remains on the expected lines - Bumrah missing Birmingham and staying fresh for Lord's - the other headache is going to be who replaces him for the second Test. India lacked bite, even with Bumrah, in the series opener and now a tough replacement call could await them.Former England quick Stuart Broad wants Arshdeep Singh to be drafted in for Bumrah, and the calls for Kuldeep Yadav's inclusion are only getting louder because of what he brings to the table. The direction which the Indian cricket team takes will be clear in the next few days but one thing is for sure - it could be a new-look bowling attack which takes the field for the Birmingham Test.","Bumrah sent down 44 overs during the Headingley Test. The ace seamer will only play three Tests to manage his body and workload. India lacked bite, even with Bumrah, in the series opener. The direction which the Indian cricket team takes will be clear in the next few days.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122092215,imgsize-69788,width-400,resizemode-4/122092215.jpg"

Poll Do you think PV Sindhu's approach to training is effective for her current career phase? Yes, adapting is crucial No, she should stick to her original style

Ace Indian shuttler PV Sindhu is embracing change, both in her game and approach as she navigates one of the most testing phases of her career. With early exits becoming more frequent, the two-time Olympic medallist has acknowledged the shifting dynamics of women’s singles badminton and is working to evolve accordingly.“The women’s singles (competition) has completely changed. Initially it was more of attack and fast rallies; it has become much more defensive with long rallies and long matches,” Sindhu said, as quoted by PTI.Sindhu’s current season has been far from ideal, with four first-round and three second-round defeats. Her only noteworthy result came at the India Open in January, where she reached the quarterfinals. Yet, the 29-year-old remains focused on long-term adjustments—especially in terms of endurance and patience.“Back then I used to attack but now every athlete is good in their defence. We are working on how patient I need to be… let’s say 30 strokes or 40 strokes,” she explained. “I need to keep a check on my physical fitness, endurance. Because I need to withstand the court for a very long period.”Training under Indonesian coach Irwansyah Adi Pratama for the last six months, Sindhu has also modified her training regimen to suit her body’s evolving needs.“It’s not going to be the same as it was 10 years ago… We adapt accordingly,” she noted.With her eyes on sustainability, Sindhu is now choosing quality over quantity. “You can’t just go out there and play five-six tournaments in a row and not be fit… You rather skip a tournament and train harder.”Despite recent tight losses, Sindhu is encouraged by signs of progress: “There’s been improvement… with some tough matches with top athletes. That’s a positive thing I can take and work on.”","Indian shuttler PV Sindhu is embracing change, both in her game and approach.

In one match, against Brighton College from Australia, Ben went from 100 to 150 entirely through reverse-sweeps.“Certainly, I didn’t want to take away his attacking flair. And although he had a big hunger for runs, he was not selfish.""He wanted to open the batting as school cricket was not going to be much of a challenge if he was coming in at No.4.

The International Cricket Council (ICC) has implemented new rules for Test cricket, including a stop clock system and fielding team's choice of striker in cases of deliberate short runs. These changes are part of the 2025-27 World Test Championship cycle.The new regulations took effect during the first Test match between Sri Lanka and Bangladesh in Galle, marking the beginning of the 2025-27 World Test Championship.The stop clock system, similar to limited-overs cricket, has been introduced to address slow over-rate concerns in Test matches.""The fielding side shall be ready to start each over within 60 seconds of the previous over being completed. An electronic clock will be displayed at the ground that counts up seconds from zero to 60,"" ICC stated, as quoted by PTI.Teams will receive two warnings for exceeding the time limit. A third violation results in five penalty runs awarded to the batting side.The ICC has specified that these warnings will reset after 80 overs are completed.Reports also indicate that umpires are no longer required to change the ball upon discovering saliva on it, although the ban on saliva usage remains active.There are suggestions that teams might deliberately apply saliva to force a ball change. However, the current Test cricket playing conditions document does not mention this modification.For decision review situations where both players and on-field umpires make referrals, the ICC has established that these will be handled in chronological order based on when they occur.","The International Cricket Council has implemented new rules for Test cricket.

Former India fast bowler Varun Aaron has taken a sharp dig at Ravindra Jadeja ’s performance on the final day of the first Test against England at Headingley.Jadeja, India’s senior left-arm spinner, came under scrutiny for his lack of precision, as England chased down a tricky target to win the match by five wickets and go 1-0 up in the series.Speaking on Star Sports’ Follow the Blues, Aaron said Jadeja failed to make the most of the rough patches on the fifth-day surface.“More than the reverse sweeps, if we go back and view that footage when Jadeja was bowling over the wicket, I would say he missed the rough a lot. He bowled either too short or he was bowling too fast, too full. They were all pitching in the middle of the wicket, not on the rough,” Aaron pointed out, referring to Jadeja’s inability to find consistent areas to trouble the batters.Jadeja's final figures of 1 for 104 in 24 overs reflected the lack of control and effectiveness that India needed during England's run chase. Ben Duckett , in particular, found it easy to reverse sweep and disrupt Jadeja’s rhythm, as England executed their aggressive approach with confidence.Aaron further criticised Jadeja’s failure to rise to the occasion, especially given his vast experience.“Somebody who is really experienced, who bowls into the rough really well, especially in Indian conditions where there is a lot of rough, and he and (Ravichandran) Ashwin have stitched together so many match-winning performances, you would back him to bowl into the rough on the fifth day and secure India a very historic victory,” he added.The criticism comes as a wake-up call for India’s bowling unit, which struggled to adapt to England’s counter-attacking style.While Jadeja has often delivered in clutch situations, his underwhelming outing at Leeds has sparked debate about India’s bowling strategies, especially in overseas conditions.",Former India fast bowler Varun Aaron has taken a sharp dig at Ravindra Jadeja ’s performance on the final day of the first Test against England at Headingley.

Poll Do you think England could have chased down a target of 450 runs? Yes, they would have succeeded No, that's too steep

England star Jos Buttler and former pacer Stuart Broad unpacked England’s remarkable chase against India in the first Test at Headingley, suggesting the hosts could have overhauled an even steeper target than the 371 they eventually chased down. Speaking on their YouTube podcast 'For The Love of Cricket ', the duo praised England’s aggressive intent and pinpointed key moments that turned the tide.India, powered by centuries from Yashasvi Jaiswal, Shubman Gill, and Rishabh Pant, had set the tone with a commanding 471 in the first innings. But England hit back hard, wiping out the lead with a response that left them just six runs behind. India then added 364 in the third innings, only for England to chase down the 371-run target in style, thanks to a scintillating 149 from Ben Duckett and a composed finish from Jamie Smith.Reflecting on the effort, Buttler made a bold assertion.I think it would've come down to time, but even if they were chasing 450, they'd have given it a go. They cruised that 370he said, underlining how fluent and in-control England looked in the final innings.He added that while the risk factor would naturally increase with a higher target, England’s batting lineup, particularly their top seven, had the firepower and belief to back themselves.They’d have had to take more risks, but they’d definitely have had a go at itButtler stressed.The statement is in line with captain Ben Stokes’ often-repeated mantra of not settling for draws, which is a hallmark of England’s Bazball philosophy.

Poll Will Jofra Archer's inclusion significantly impact England's chances in the second Test? Yes, definitely No, it won't make a difference vs India

England have named pacer Jofra Archer in their squad for the second Test against India, marking a sensational return to the longest format after more than four years. The 30-year-old fast bowler, whose career has been repeatedly disrupted by injuries, last played a Test in February 2021.Archer's inclusion comes as England look to strengthen their 1-0 lead in the five-match Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy series. The hosts sealed a memorable five-wicket win in the opening Test at Headingley on Tuesday, chasing down 370 with confidence.Archer’s last appearance for England came in March during the ICC Champions Trophy in Pakistan, where he featured in a one-day international against South Africa. However, the right-arm quick only recently returned to red-ball cricket, playing his first first-class game in four years for Sussex against Durham. Though he picked up just one wicket, selectors were encouraged by his rhythm and fitness. Clips of his first over after returning to the format, followed by his first wicket in the form of an lbw dismissal of Emilio Gay had earlier gone viral on social media, with fans buzzing about his return.With 42 wickets from 13 Tests at an average of 31, Archer’s record speaks volumes about his impact when fully fit. His pace, bounce and ability to bowl hostile spells provide England with an added edge, particularly at Edgbaston, where seamers have traditionally thrived.His return is also timely, with concerns over the workload and niggles of fellow quicks. Gus Atkinson is still recovering, while the situation of Josh Tongue and Brydon Carse is being monitored closely. Former England pacer Stuart Broad and Jos Buttler too have called for the inclusion of Archer for the second test.Archer’s comeback is set to energise the bowling unit and fans alike. With skipper Ben Stokes reiterating that England will continue to play aggressive, result-oriented cricket, Archer's return aligns well with the team’s motto under the Bazball regime.The second Test begins on July 2 at Edgbaston, a venue where England will look to extend their winning run with one of their most exciting fast bowlers back in the mix.",England have named pacer Jofra Archer in their squad for the second Test against India.

What India are doing in Birmingham today, practice schedule, plan and more

France captain Kylian Mbappe has filed a legal complaint accusing former club Paris Saint-Germain of ""moral harassment"", according to the Paris prosecutor's office, which confirmed on Thursday that an investigation into the matter has been opened.The 26-year-old, who officially joined Real Madrid this summer after a prolific seven-year spell with PSG, is also in a legal tussle with the French champions over unpaid dues. Mbappe is seeking €55 million ($64.4 million) in unpaid wages and bonuses from the club.Mbappe’s latest grievance stems from how he was treated during the early stages of the 2023–24 season. According to the complaint, the striker was excluded from the first-team setup and made to train separately with players PSG were actively looking to offload — a move he believes was punitive after he declined to extend his contract with the club.The issue echoes broader concerns about contract-related coercion in football, a topic that has previously drawn attention from the French players' union, which lodged a formal complaint in a similar context last year.bappe was also omitted from PSG’s pre-season tour of Asia in 2023 and missed the opening match of the campaign. He was later reinstated to the first team following talks with the club’s hierarchy.The legal action adds another layer of tension to Mbappe’s departure from the French capital, where he scored 256 goals in 308 appearances and won numerous domestic titles. Notably, PSG lifted the UEFA Champions League for the first time in their history just weeks after his exit.The outcome of the investigation could have significant implications for both Mbappe’s claims and the club’s management practices, particularly in how high-profile players are treated during contract disputes.","Kylian Mbappe has filed a legal complaint accusing former club Paris Saint- Germain of ""moral harassment"", according to the Paris prosecutor's office.

Poll What are your thoughts on Switzerland's recent defeat to Luzern’s Under-15 boys team? It's embarrassing for the national team. It's just a training match, no big deal.

In a surprising turn of events ahead of UEFA Women's Euro 2025, host nation Switzerland suffered a humiliating 7-1 defeat to Luzern’s Under-15 boys team in a behind-closed-doors friendly. The match, which was played in three 30-minute thirds, was meant to be confidential but was leaked via social media by chance.According to Swiss outlet, a Luzern youth player shared clips from the match on TikTok, exposing the near unbelievable scoreline. The footage, which featured Juventus forward Alisha Lehmann and fellow international Alayah Pilgrim, reportedly garnered over 70,000 views before it was deleted. Lehmann is one of the most popular figures in women's football , boasting close to 17 million followers on Instagram.This is not the first time the Swiss women’s team has faced youth opposition during their Euro preparations. At their training camp, they previously lost 2-1 to FC Solothurn’s U-15 side but managed to edge past FC Biel’s U-15s with a 2-1 win.While the result may seem shocking to many, the Swiss Football Association has downplayed the result. Spokesperson Sven Micosse clarified the purpose of these matches, saying, “It’s not uncommon in women’s football to compete against junior teams. The goal is to bring a certain competitive element. The focus during this phase of preparation is on the physical aspect. Regardless of the result, these training matches are very similar to our international matches in terms of intensity and mileage. ”Switzerland, who automatically qualified for Euro 2025 as hosts, will next face Czechia in a formal friendly on Thursday before kicking off their tournament campaign against Norway on July 2.",Switzerland lost 7-1 to Luzern’s Under-15 boys team in a behind-closed-doors friendly.

Poll Do you believe the German soccer federation (DFB) should face harsher penalties for tax evasion? Yes, definitely No, the fine is sufficient

The German soccer federation has been convicted of tax evasion related to its successful 2006 World Cup bid.It brought an end of sorts on Wednesday to a 10-year process prompted by allegations that Germany used a slush fund to buy votes from FIFA executive committee members to be certain of hosting the tournament.A regional court in Frankfurt fined the federation, known by its German acronym DFB, 110,000 euros ($128,000) at the culmination of a nearly 16-month trial at the end of the investigation process. Prosecutors had been pushing for a larger fine after accusing the DFB of failing to pay approximately 2.7 million euros (now $3.1 million) in taxes related to its payment of 6.7 million euros ($7.8 million) to FIFA, world soccer's governing body, in April 2005. 'That payment settled a loan that Germany great Franz Beckenbauer, the head of the World Cup organizing committee, had accepted three years earlier from Robert Louis-Dreyfus, a former Adidas executive and then part-owner of the Infront marketing agency.The money was channeled through a Swiss law firm to a Qatari company belonging to Mohammed Bin Hammam, then a member of FIFA's Executive Committee. The exact purpose of the money was never determined.Theo Zwanziger, who was DFB president at the time, told Spiegel magazine in 2015, ""there was definitely a slush fund in the German World Cup bid."" He accused his successor, Wolfgang Niersbach, of lying about it. Both were on the World Cup organizing committee.The DFB concealed the repayment of the loan as a contribution toward a planned World Cup opening gala, which was later canceled, and falsely declared it a business expense a year later. Zwanziger, Niersbach, and DFB general secretary Horst R. Schmidt were originally charged in the trial. The proceedings against all three, who consistently denied the allegations of tax evasion, were eventually dropped upon payment of fines.""The court is certain without a doubt that the DFB evaded taxes and that those involved put up with it,"" presiding judge Eva-Marie Distler said Wednesday in comments reported by news agency dpa.The DFB was initially fined 130,000 euros ($151,000), but 20,000 euros was waived because of the ""procedural delays"" in the case. Distler was scathing in her criticism of the DFB, saying it presented a ""catastrophic image"" in its investigation of the affair and must bear the costs for the proceedings.""The clock ticks differently at the DFB. It generates astronomical legal fees. The responsible people externalize responsibility. No one has to face personal consequences,"" Distler said. ""No DFB representative participated in either the investigation or the trial. You have to ask, are they not taking the justice system seriously?""The DFB has one week to appeal the ruling.","The German soccer federation has been convicted of tax evasion related to its successful 2006 World Cup bid.

Poll Was Auckland City's draw against Boca Juniors the biggest upset in Club World Cup history? Yes, definitely! No, there have been bigger upsets.

DAZN

In one of the most astonishing results at the 2025 Club World Cup, and in football altogether, Auckland City, a side ranked 4,971st in the world by Opta, held South American side Boca Juniors, ranked 152 on the planet, to a 1-1 draw on Tuesday.Auckland, the lowest-ranked team in the tournament and already eliminated after two heavy defeats - a 6-0 thumping by Benfica and a 10-0 demolition by German giants Bayern Munich, produced a defiant display to deny Argentina's six-time Copa Libertadores winners a spot in the knockout stages. Boca needed a win to stand a chance of progressing.Despite being out-shot 40 to 4 and conceding nearly 70% possession, Auckland’s grit and determination paid off.To put the scale of the upset into perspective, this was the equivalent of Scottish third-tier side Cove Rangers (ranked 4,844th) drawing with Juventus (ranked 25th), as per Opta.Boca went ahead in the 26th minute after Lautaro Di Lollo’s header hit the post and ricocheted in off Auckland goalkeeper Nathan Garrow for an unfortunate own goal. But Garrow recovered impressively, pulling off a series of second-half saves to preserve the scoreline.Auckland struck back in the 52nd minute when Christian Gray powered in a header from Jerson Lagos’ corner, which was incidentally the team’s first goal of the tournament.“It’s been a tough trip, we’ve had some tough results but I’m just happy for the team and the boys, I think we deserve it, we got a little bit of respect back I hope,” said goal scorer Gray to",Auckland City beat Boca Juniors 1-0 in their Group C clash. The result is the first time a South American side has beaten an Argentine side in the Copa Libertadores. Boca had already been thrashed 6-0 by Bayern Munich in their opening game.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122069424,imgsize-132756,width-400,resizemode-4/122069424.jpg"
Indian football in freefall: One win in 16 matches; five goals in two years,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/top-stories/indian-football-in-freefall-one-win-in-16-matches-five-goals-in-two-years/articleshow/122066985.cms,"Indian players stand for the national anthem (Photo: @IndianFootball on X)

Indian football is in freefall. Once seen as a nation on the rise, India now find itself sliding down the global and continental ranks with alarming speed.A 0-1 defeat to Hong Kong in a must-win AFC Asian Cup 2027 qualifier has brought things to a breaking point. Ranked 133rd in the latest FIFA rankings — just two spots above their worst position in a decade — the Indian men’s team has now won just one of their last 16 games across competitions.The loss to Hong Kong stung more because of how it unfolded. After a relatively encouraging first half, India conceded in the 94th minute when goalkeeper Vishal Kaith fouled Michael Udebuluzor in the box.Hong Kong’s Stefan Pereira slotted the penalty with ease. Another game lost. Another opportunity wasted.Missed chances defined India’s night — Ashique Kuruniyan missed a sitter, and even the returning Sunil Chhetri couldn’t convert from close range. The team has managed just five goals in two years, underlining the deepening crisis in attack.Chhetri’s comeback from retirement offered a glimmer of hope, but at 40, even his leadership and presence can’t mask the lack of quality and cutting edge in the squad.On that, scoring just five goals in two years highlights how significantly the Indian forwards have declined over time.In the broader Asian picture, India now rank 24th out of 46 AFC nations — behind countries like Vietnam, Kyrgyzstan, and Lebanon. Compare this to 2018, when India were ranked 96 in the world and competing closely with teams like Jordan.That same Jordan team is now in the 2026 World Cup and recently reached the AFC Asian Cup final. India, meanwhile, are still struggling to score.The situation off the field offers little reassurance. The national setup remains unclear, with coaching duties currently being split — officially or otherwise — between club and country.India's golden moment in football feels like a distant memory. Without a clear strategy, youth development pipeline, or consistent results, the path to recovery appears long and uncertain.The dream of qualifying for major tournaments like the AFC Asian Cup and even the World Cup now seems more distant than ever.","India lost 0-1 to Hong Kong in a must-win AFC Asian Cup 2027 qualifier.

Gautam Gambhir Explosive Press Conference: On Drop Catches, Batting Collapse, Shubman Gill Captaincy

At this time of the year, the city’s famed Maidan comes alive with its rain, rainbow and football’s pre-season rituals.The Calcutta Football League — Asia’s oldest football league — is set to commence on Wednesday and the city’s representatives in the Indian Super League , Mohun Bagan SG, East Bengal FC and Mohammedan SC, have already hit the ground running with their reserve teams, while others in the fray are aspiring to give the Big Three a run for their money in this traditional curtain-raiser.In the past, the CFL has served as a breeding ground for young talents to stake claims to the big league across the country. Like previous years, Bengal’s Santosh Trophy-winning coach Sanjoy Sen will be watching the players with his notebook. Scouts for big teams will also be on the alert, hoping to catch some of them young and unleash them in a bigger and better stage.There’s a catch, though. The sight of the big league seems as clear as mud. “We are also supposed to get going with our pre-season by this time, no?” asked an India player, “Is it happening?”Is the ISL happening? That’s the question hanging over Indian football as a pregnant pause this season. And the scenes in Kolkata could serve as a microcosm of the confusion and doubts plaguing Indian football stakeholders across the country.Despite there being no clarity over a fresh Master Rights Agreement (MRA) between the AIFF and Football Sports Development Limited (FSDL) which runs the ISL, the federation has obtained permission from the sports ministry to conduct the league from “second week of Sept 2025 to last week of April 2026.”Equally crucially, the subject pertaining to restructuring of the AIFF’s internal governance through a revised constitution is waiting for a Supreme Court go-ahead.Quiz: Who's that IPL player? Given this uncertainty, the clubs have not taken any decision about when the senior team players and coaches will arrive. Mohun Bagan and East Bengal are yet to sign the agreement to take part in Durand Cup (July 22 onwards) while Mohammedan SC are keeping the option open of participating in it with their CFL side.Several players — former and current — that TOI caught up with expressed concerns about this unprecedented state of play, the financial implications foremost on most minds. “If there’s no ISL, it will no doubt impact the players financially. If players can’t take care of themselves and their families, it is bound to affect their performance,” said former India player Alvito D’Cunha. “I only hope all stakeholders come together and get this problem resolved amicably,” he added.Bengal coach Sen too agreed that a swift end to this impasse was imperative. “Nowadays, most clubs enter into long-term deals with players. But for those youngsters, who aspire to be in the big league, it can be a difficult time,” pointed out Sen. Sen would know, having guided Mohun Bagan to an I-League trophy and once serving as an assistant coach with now-defunct ATK in the ISL.The FSDL is understood to have verbally informed the ISL club owners that the next edition of the league will not start until there is clarity on the MRA. However, players believe that the league will continue.“What is happening is unfortunate. After all, future of so many players, that too in the country’s premier league, is at stake,” said a former India player, associated with an ISL team but wishing to remain anonymous, “Like others I also expect this uncertainty to be over soon.”Mohammedan SC could be a case study in what all can go wrong with a football club. Not only did they finish last in their debut ISL season but were also hit by a player revolt over unpaid salaries following a standoff between investors over transfer of shares. The current ISL impasse could further compound their problems. Yet former player Dipendu Biswas, in the dual role of football secretary and senior team manager, is optimistic. “Our team will be back on its feet soon, so will the ISL,” he said.",The Calcutta Football League — Asia’s oldest football league — is set to commence on Wednesday.

Training local marshals at Formula E circuits

Safety and technical knowledge are paramount in Formula E, where the sport involves handling some of the world’s fastest electric cars. Now, the FIA has given fans a behind-the-scenes look at how local marshals in each host country are trained before every Formula E race to ensure that operations run swiftly, efficiently, and to the highest standards.A video shared on the FIA Official Instagram page features Benoit Dupont, Head of Circuit Operations at FIA Formula E, offering a glimpse into the marshal training process at the Jakarta E-Prix.Speaking about the preparation in Jakarta this year, Dupont explains, “Before each Formula E race, we make sure that marshals are trained to the correct level to understand how to efficiently remove and recover a car. It's very important to have precise and fast operations. We've been in Indonesia before, but it was two years ago, so the goal here is to bring everyone back up to speed.”He adds that Formula E cars require a specific method of being lifted, particularly using a strap in a defined way. As a result, every post is trained individually to ensure marshals are fully up to date.Dupont also highlights the crucial role of the clerk of the course, who acts as a bridge between FIA officials and local marshals.He says, “Leaving a legacy is an important part of what the FIA brings to these races. There are international procedures that might not be followed at local races, so we ensure they meet the latest standards. That’s why we conduct training sessions like this,” he says. “The clerk of the course connects with the marshals, all the trackside personnel, and the recovery team. Since they communicate in their local language, the clerk ensures the communication line remains as efficient as possible.”Commenting on the video, one Formula E fan wrote, “Well done on showcasing these wonderful men and women who keep races going and clear up the mess after an OOPS moment from the drivers.”Also Read: Dan Ticktum shares unfiltered pictures and a note after Jakarta win, mentions losing F1 chance: “It wasn’t down to my attitude” The Jakarta E-Prix was a single-header this year, unlike its double-header format in the 2023 season. With just four more races remaining, the 2024–25 Formula E season is nearing its conclusion. Next up is the Berlin double-header on July 11–12, followed by the season finale in London on July 26–27.","FIA gives fans a behind-the-scenes look at how local marshals in each host country are trained before every Formula E race.

The Tokyo E-Prix (Round 9) also broke records in Japan, registering the highest-ever Formula E TV audience in the country — a 20 percent rise over Season 10’s numbers on Fuji TV.Digital audiences have also shown notable growth. Data from Emplifi revealed a 13 percent increase in social video views and a 12 percent rise in engagement, underscoring the vibrant and interactive fan community that continues to grow around the sport.Commenting on the surge in popularity, Formula E CEO Jeff Dodds said, “The latest figures from our external providers are truly phenomenal and show the tremendous momentum behind the growth of our sport. They highlight that not only do we have world-leading technology and acceleration in the cars, but that it’s producing some of the best, most competitive racing that both old and new fans can’t get enough of.”“We’re building fan bases and loyalty in key and emerging markets, with Mexico and the US as prime examples of how our investment and long-term presence are paying off.

Nyck De Vries pens a post after Jakarta race



Nyck De Vries of Mahindra Racing has finally spoken up after his controversial race at the Jakarta E-Prix, where he received a ten-second time penalty for hitting Andretti’s Jake Dennis just moments before the race ended. Both were aiming for the podium, but the collision ended their chances of gaining any points or a podium finish. In his latest post on Instagram, De Vries summed up the race day and also mentioned his teammate Edoardo Mortara for his much-awaited podium.Nyck De Vries shared a heartbreaking picture of himself sitting dejectedly with his back to the chicane. He wrote along with it, “Unfortunate end to a good day. P3 in qualifying, leading the race, 6 seconds gap, 7 laps to go, forced to retire the car. Overall a positive weekend, a great podium by @edomortara and good performance all round. Proud of our team. Terima kasih (thank you) Jakarta.”His fans, however, refused to leave his side and showed their support in the comments section. One fan wrote, “Terimakasih for trying your best Nyck. Rooting for you for the remainder of the season! We can’t change the past but we can come back stronger! See you in Berlin.” Another said, “You did great, Nyck!

Dan Ticktum bares his feelings after maiden Formula E win



Dan Ticktum’s fans hail him for his unfiltered note



Dan Ticktum shared several memorable pictures from race day and the victory celebration after winning his maiden Formula E race in Jakarta. He penned a long note on his breakthrough win and, true to his unapologetic self, the Cupra Kiro driver didn’t mince words while opening his heart to fans on Instagram, along with a bunch of pictures. He reflected on the time when he was taking baby steps in Formula 1 but had to quit the field amid controversies.Dan Ticktum’s note comes just days after his first-ever Formula E win, following his victory at the Jakarta E-Prix and the traditional champagne bath on the podium. Starting from the very beginning, he wrote, “So there it is, first win in @fiaformulae in the books. I am immensely proud of what this great team of people have achieved this year. As some of you know, I was very close to being in F1 several years ago, but due to some political s****, it wasn’t meant to be. (For those too ignorant — no, it wasn’t down to my attitude). I was ready to give up racing, as at the time, my dream — to me at least — was over.”Moving to his switch to Formula E, he added, “However, an opportunity arose to take part in this exciting, relatively new championship, full of the best drivers in the world.@alexhuigusto and @russellohagan were instrumental in giving me this opportunity, and they, along with the rest of the team, have stuck by me during three very tough years being the least funded team on the grid. This year, with our new investment, it has enabled us to embark on an exciting new chapter with @porsche.motorsport and @cupra_official. The support from them has been immense.”He further wrote, “Long story short — I’m glad I didn’t give up and kept trying to pursue big things in motorsport. The @fiaformulae championship, and @jeffformulae in particular, have given me an environment where I can be me (mostly), and I can finally say that this year I’m enjoying my job again. Thank you to everyone who has supported me to this point. I know it’s only one race win, but it conjured up a lot of emotions for me personally, along with my father and family, who sacrificed so much. Plenty more to come, I hope. Onto Berlin!”Posting pictures of himself showing middle fingers to the camera, he added at the end, “P.S. Last 2 slides are for all those who doubted me.”IndyCar racer Louis Foster reacted to his post, saying, “Mega mega mega mate.” There was also a congratulatory message from the FIA Formula E page. Social media star Juca Vipari wrote, “YESSSSS BROTHER! The first of many!!”A fan also told Ticktum in the comments section, “Enjoy 1 million beers.” Another said, “A fight-or-flight mode and you chose the harder option with an EXTREMELY high reward — and it paid off! Congrats Dan! The first of many.” One more added, “So deserved. Thinking from the end of last year to where you and the team are now — seriously amazing work. So good to see you happy after some hard years. On to a great end of the year.

There’s then a glimpse of the garage, which smells like “focused rubber and podium energy.” He even has his own name for media day, which he calls “Smile until your face hurts.”It’s also revealed that Da Costa sits with the engineers to understand the data – and he actually gets it. As he suits up in his race gear, it’s said to be “30 percent style and 70 percent sweat.” The video also offers a close look at his Porsche electric car, which he races in the Formula E Grand Prix this season.His fans loved the fun video and called it “awesome”.

Sergio Aguero takes on the race track in a GEN3 Evo



All about GEN3 Evo Sessions

Manchester City star Sergio Aguero is one of the few chosen ones to get a chance to drive a Formula E car on a race track. The footballer had his own GEN3 Evo session, guided by none other than TAG Heuer Porsche driver Pascal Wehrlein. And Aguero nailed it by driving the electric race car like a pro, although he missed his engineer’s message to slow down to cool the tyres.Sergio Aguero got the opportunity to drive the Porsche 99X Electric GEN3 Evo Formula E car during Miami’s Evo Sessions on March 5 and 6. The video from his Evo session is pure entertainment, as he takes lap after lap, clearly enjoying the thrill of driving a race car.Earlier, the official handle of FIA Formula E shared a video from Sergio’s Evo Session on Instagram. It showed how the footballer missed the messages to slow down and continued at high speed despite the need to cool the tyres. He later asked them to raise the volume and eventually slowed down. Pascal Wehrlein was seen doing a great job coaching him over the radio.The 37-year-old told Formulae.com about the opportunity, “This is absolutely crazy: from footballer to racing driver in one of the fastest racing cars in the world.Every child is familiar with Porsche. The brand represents an iconic heritage, particularly in motorsport. I am absolutely delighted and would like to thank everyone involved for this unique opportunity.”Aguero and other participants underwent detailed training, which included simulator sessions, physical conditioning, driver coaching, hardware customization, and engineering briefings. It not only gave them the thrill of driving a race car but also gave viewers insight into the intricate world of Formula E — how a driver is trained and how the car is driven during a race. A complete documentary will be released later this year, showcasing the entire Evo Sessions footage.Sharing his reaction when Formula E CEO Jeff Dodds first presented the idea, he said, “The initial reaction when I presented the concept of ‘Evo Sessions’ to our teams and partners was, ‘This is wild!’ — which is when I immediately knew we had to bring it to life. We wanted to do something that has never been done before in motorsport; something that would give audiences and our fan base a unique perspective into the world of a Formula E driver, through the eyes of some of their favourite online personalities. ”He added, “Formula E is the fastest-growing motorsport in the world, and we have a clear target to hit half a billion fans by 2030. Through collaborating with some of the biggest names in popular culture right now, we’re able to open up Formula E to a whole new fanbase.”Also Read: Pascal Wehrlein on second place in Shanghai: “First time I felt like we were very competitive in the wet” Even the trainers are among the best Formula E drivers in the world.

Edoardo Mortara on his second place finish in Jakarta

Edoardo Mortara on being part of Mahindra Racing



Formula E Season 11 has turned out well for most teams, with new podium winners emerging in each round. At the recently held Jakarta E-Prix, it was Mahindra Racing’s Edoardo Mortara who secured his first podium of the season and the team’s second. While he’s happy to have claimed second place in Jakarta, he feels they could have achieved even more. His teammate, Nyck De Vries, was handed a ten-second time penalty for colliding with Jake Dennis as they approached the finish line.Edoardo Mortara joined Mahindra Racing in 2023 and had been chasing a podium finish ever since. Speaking after securing second place at the Jakarta E-Prix, the 38-year-old said, “I’m feeling kind of disappointed for the team because I think that more was possible for us, but actually happy for me. It’s been a long time coming, this podium, and if I look back, there were several occasions where, with a bit more luck, we could have changed it. ”Mortara found his podium opportunity when both his teammate Nyck De Vries and Andretti’s Jake Dennis were removed from contention after their collision. “But nevertheless, super happy with today’s race. I think we managed the strategy pretty well, especially with the first Attack Mode.We got a little bit unlucky with the Safety Car and Full Course Yellow because I think I could have made good use of my Attack Mode and passed Dan [Ticktum]. I was in front of him before the second Attack Mode. Nevertheless, super happy with second place and already looking forward to the next one,” he said.However, Mortara regrets that Jakarta isn't a double-header this year, unlike its last edition in 2023. ""Right from the start of the year, we're showing more and more performance, and this weekend we were really, really good. It's a shame that we only have one race here. I would have hoped to have a second one,"" he told FormulaE.com in an interview.Now running high on confidence, Mortara aims to continue the momentum in the upcoming Berlin double-header. He has achieved multiple podiums in Berlin in previous years, including one win.Reflecting on Mahindra Racing’s significant improvement this season, Mortara said, ""This year has been crucial for us. We brought some big updates in terms of software that helped us close a bit of the gap with the front-runners. I feel that now we have a package that is capable — not always, but on certain race weekends — of challenging at the front, and we probably had the best package in the race. Nevertheless, this result (Jakarta) shows great promise for the final race weekends, especially Berlin, which has always been a good one for me.

Former world heavyweight champion Anthony Joshua was hospitalised in Nigeria on Monday after being involved in a road accident that claimed the lives of two close friends and team members, his promoter confirmed. Joshua, 35, sustained injuries in the crash but is in a stable condition and remains under observation.“Matchroom Boxing and 258 BXG can confirm that Anthony sustained injuries in the accident and was taken to hospital for checks and treatment. He is in a stable condition and will remain there for observation,” Matchroom Boxing said in a statement. The promoter later identified the two fatalities as Sina Ghami and Latif Ayodele. “With profound sadness it has been confirmed that two close friends and team members Sina Ghami and Latif Ayodele have tragically passed away,” the statement added.Police said the accident occurred around 11:00 am local time in Makun, along the busy Lagos–Ibadan Expressway, a major route linking Ogun State to Lagos, Nigeria’s commercial hub. According to the Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC), the Lexus SUV carrying Joshua was suspected to have been travelling above the prescribed speed limit.“The vehicle lost control during an overtaking manoeuvre and crashed into a stationary truck by the side of the road,” the FRSC said.Photos circulating on social media showed Joshua being assisted from the wreckage, visibly in discomfort. Ogun State Police confirmed that Joshua, who was seated in the rear of the vehicle, suffered minor injuries and was receiving medical attention alongside another injured person.A joint statement from the Lagos and Ogun state governments said medical evaluations indicated that both patients admitted after the crash were stable and did not require emergency intervention. Nigerian President Bola Tinubu also spoke to Joshua by phone, offering condolences and wishing him a speedy recovery.Joshua, whose parents are from southwestern Nigeria, is a regular visitor to the country. Earlier this month, the two-time world champion knocked out YouTuber-turned-boxer Jake Paul in a Netflix-backed bout in Miami. Talks have also been ongoing over a potential mega-fight with Tyson Fury in 2026.","Former world heavyweight champion Anthony Joshua was involved in a road accident in Lagos, Nigeria on Monday.

Yashasvi Jaiswal press conference: On Shubman Gill, confusion in India team selection and more

MUMBAI: When the 2025-26 domestic season began, Vidarbha's young opening batter Aman Mokhade was given a 'simple' task by his Mumbai-based coach and mentor Jwala Singh, who is also the childhood coach/mentor of India's star opener Yashasvi Jaiswal . ""'You have to finish the season amongst the top 10 run-getters in the Ranji Trophy ,' I told him,"" Jwala Singh told TOI on Tuesday.Considering that Mokhade had scored just 107 runs in four matches at 13.37 in the 2024-25 Ranji Trophy season, struggling to even make it to the Vidarbha XI, Jwala’s ‘task’ seemed to be a tall ask for the young gun.However, so far, Mokhade has exceeded Jwala's expectations. For someone who has a modest record so far -he has scored 870 runs in 13 first-class matches at 39.54, 563 runs in 11 games in List A cricket, and 306 runs in 14 matches in T20 cricket- the Nagpur-based opener is enjoying a breakout season.At this point, the left-hander, who seems to have finally come of age, is this edition's highest run-getter in the ongoing Vijay Hazare Trophy, having scored 331 runs in three matches at 110.33, and a strike rate of 109.60, with two hundreds. He scored 110 off 99 balls against a Bengal attack which had Mohammed Shami, Mukesh Kumar, Akash Deep, and Shahbaz Ahmed, who have all played for India. On Monday, Mokhade slammed 139 off 125 balls against Jammu & Kashmir.In sizzling form, Mokhade has managed to outscore even India's 'keeper-bat Dhruv Jurel (307 runs in three matches), who has been in superb touch.In the first leg of the Ranji Trophy, the 24-year-old has scored 577 runs in five matches at 96.16, with three hundreds and a fifty and a highest score of 183, and is perched amongst the top six run-getters in the red-ball tournament.In the Syed Mushtaq Ali T20 Trophy, Mokhade made 206 runs in six matches at 34.33, with three fifties, and was the top run-getter for Vidarbha along with Dhruv Shorey.Talking about Jwala Singh helped him hone his game, Mokhade said, ""He helped me a lot in arranging practice sessions, like open nets scenarios. And playing on different surfaces, like on plastic cover, wet cement pitches. He also helped me with mental preparation.""Recalling how he came in contact with Jwala around three years back, the Vidarbha batter said, ""Since he was coaching Jaiswal and Prithvi Shaw, I knew Jwala sir for a long time. A friend of mine praised him a lot and showed me his videos too. I liked his coaching style, and hence went to him to develop my game,"" Mokhade said.""Like Yashasvi, Aman too is a left-handed opener! I was initially reluctant to coach him, but Vidarbha batsman Apoorv Wankhede, who trains under me, convinced me. The boy has serious talent,"" Jwala said.""I want to play for India and I also want an opportunity to play in the IPL,"" Mokhade said.","Vidarbha batsman Aman Mokhade is enjoying a breakout season.

On this day: Retirement that stunned Indian cricket - How MS Dhoni's Test career ended,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/on-this-day-retirement-that-stunned-indian-cricket-how-ms-dhonis-test-career-ended/articleshow/126253119.cms,"MS Dhoni. (Photo/social media)

India can survive without Virat and Rohit, not without Bumrah

From ticket collector to Test captain

The news did not arrive with drama. It did not wait for a farewell match, a final lap around the ground on the shoulders of fellow teammates, or a long speech explaining the moment. It arrived as a press release. No association was allowed to turn the moment into an event. There were no speeches. There was not even a farewell press conference.Without any ceremony, 44 minutes after MS Dhoni finished his post-match press conference following the Boxing Day Test at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, the BCCI sent out a press release. The news came an hour after India had managed to draw an away Test — the first time in the previous 14 Australia-India Tests that the visiting team had not lost. It came in the middle of a series. Nothing about the moment suggested an ending. But it was.Dhoni was batting on 24 when the match was called off early at the MCG. Four overs were left and India still had four wickets in hand. During the customary captain’s press conference at the end of the match, he made no mention of retirement. The announcement followed shortly through a BCCI press release, which cited “the strain of playing all formats” as the reason for his decision.Virat Kohli was named India’s captain for the final Test of the series in Sydney, a series India had already lost.In the months leading up to his retirement, Dhoni had dealt with fitness issues. He missed five One-Day Internationals against Sri Lanka in November due to a hand injury. The same injury ruled him out of the first Test against Australia in Adelaide. Since the start of 2008, counting international matches across formats as well as IPL and Champions League T20 games, Dhoni had played 398 matches. That was the most by any cricketer in that period. Suresh Raina was next with 369 games.Dhoni’s place in the Test side was not under question, but his batting returns dipped in 2014. He averaged 33 from 17 innings that year. India’s overseas results had also suffered under his leadership. From 2011 onwards, India won only two of their 22 away Tests and lost 13.But Dhoni’s Test career was never only about numbers.Dhoni’s journey to the top of Indian Test cricket had not followed a familiar path. He broke what many saw as a metropolitan hold on the game and carved out a distinct place in India’s Test history. His rise took him from working as a ticket collector with Indian Railways to leading the Indian Test team.His first Test as captain came against South Africa in Kanpur in April 2008, after regular captain Anil Kumble was ruled out due to injury. Dhoni took over the role full-time later that year when Kumble retired after the Delhi Test against Australia in October. Under Dhoni, India reached the No. 1 position in the ICC Test rankings in 2009, a spot they held until the tour of England in 2011.Across his Test career, Dhoni played 90 matches after making his debut in 2005. He scored 4,876 runs at an average of 38, with a highest score of 224 against Australia in Chennai in 2013. As a wicketkeeper, he accounted for 294 dismissals.Long before international success arrived, those close to Indian domestic cricket believed Dhoni was meant for bigger things. Yet, his career nearly took a different turn early on. After not being informed of his selection for the East Zone side, Dhoni accepted a lift to Kolkata airport. The car broke down midway, and he missed the flight. That allowed Deep Dasgupta to play the Duleep Trophy match the next morning. Dhoni was left out. The setback delayed his progress, but did not stop it.He continued to work his way through domestic cricket and finally earned his first Test cap against Sri Lanka in Chennai in 2005. Over time, the city would claim him as one of its own. Dhoni was never seen as a traditional Test cricketer. His methods, both behind the stumps and with the bat, stood apart. For him, the game was as much about decision-making as it was about skill.He did not hide his limitations. Instead, took over an Indian Test side in its twilight and handed it back, just before dawn. In the process, he became India’s most successful Test captain in terms of wins at the time, leading the team to 27 victories. He also presided over India’s 18-month run at the top of the Test rankings between 2009 and 2011.Dhoni’s Test career spanned 90 matches. He scored 4,876 runs at an average of 38, with a highest score of 224 against Australia in Chennai in 2013. Behind the stumps, he completed 294 dismissals, the fifth-highest tally in Test history.Before the Melbourne Test in 2014, the last drawn Test between India and Australia had come in Delhi in 2008. That match marked Anil Kumble’s final appearance in Tests. Six years later, after another drawn Test, Dhoni stepped away.There was no announcement from the podium, no moment set aside for reflection. Just a line in a press release, sent out 44 minutes after a routine media interaction, closing the chapter on one of India’s most significant Test careers.As he did so, the message was unspoken but clear: ""Over to you, Virat!""",MS Dhoni announced his retirement from Test cricket on Monday. The decision was announced in a press release 44 minutes after Dhoni's post-match press conference. The news came an hour after India had managed to draw an away Test against Australia. Dhoni was batting on 24 when the match was called off early.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126253630,imgsize-33400,width-400,resizemode-4/mnh-13.jpg"

The Indian Street Premier League (ISPL), India's trailblazing tennis-ball T10 cricket tournament, is set to illuminate Surat for Season 3 from January 9 to February 6, 2026, at the Lalbhai Contractor Stadium.Known as one of the nation's most exciting tennis-ball leagues, ISPL continues to elevate the game with elite talent, electrifying batting displays, and nail-biting finishes.Eight high-octane franchises will clash for supremacy when the season begins: Majhi Mumbai, Chennai Singams, Tiigers of Kolkata, Falcon Risers Hyderabad, Bengaluru Strikers, Srinagar Ke Veer, Ahmedabad Lions, and Delhi Superheroes.With a stellar mix of proven match-winners and emerging stars, spectators can expect towering sixes, high-pressure chases, and memorable individual performances.As anticipation builds for the season opener, here are the top five batters to watch in ISPL Season 3 — players capable of turning games on their head and defining the tournament with the bat.Vijay Pawle has built a reputation as a clutch performer, and his ISPL exploits have made him one of the league’s most valuable players.The West Zone star returned to Majhi Mumbai for Season 3 with the highest-ever ISPL bid, Rs 32.50 lakh, via the Right to Match (RTM) card.Known as the “Speed Master” of Indian tennis-ball cricket, Pawle combines explosive batting with sharp game awareness. His all-round value adds depth to his game, and he captained Majhi Mumbai to the Season 2 title. A previous Best Fielder Award in Season 1 underscores his athleticism. As Majhi Mumbai aim to defend their crown, Pawle’s influence with the bat will again be pivotal.Among the most destructive opening batters in ISPL tennis-ball cricket, Ketan Mhatre remains a name that commands attention. From Waklan village in Thane district, Mhatre was retained by Chennai Singams for Rs 26.40 lakh via RTM, the second-highest bid of Season 3. A fearless top-order attacker, he has built a reputation for aggressive stroke play and explosive power-hitting. Across 16 matches in Seasons 1 and 2, he totaled 384 runs at a striking rate of 180.75. As Chennai Singams prepare for another campaign, all eyes will be on Mhatre to provide explosive starts from ball one.Earlier known as Sagar Ali, Saif Ali has emerged as one of the most consistent and dependable batters in the ISPL. A left-hander from Kashiara village in West Bengal, Saif was picked up by Tiigers of Kolkata for Rs 23.65 lakh, making him one of the season’s top bids. In Season 2, he became the first ISPL player to score back-to-back fifties, highlighting his composure under pressure. Across 19 matches over two ISPL seasons, Saif has 595 runs with four half-centuries, cementing his status as a reliable run-scorer. He has also represented West Bengal at the youth level.Fardeen Kazi’s defining moment came in Season 2 with a dramatic last-ball chase against Chennai Singams, a performance that announced him as a premier finisher. Needing 22 runs off the final over, Kazi led a calculated assault, culminating in a match-winning six off the last ball, one of ISPL’s most memorable victories. Among the top-priced batsmen in Season 2, Kazi continued to command premium value in Season 3, joining Bengaluru Strikers for Rs 22.30 lakh. Now with Bengaluru, Kazi is expected to be a go-to player in high-pressure moments.Jagannath Sarkar has quietly become one of the ISPL’s most reliable and entertaining openers. Retained by Chennai Singams for Rs 20.02 lakh, the Tarakeswar-born batsman from West Bengal enters Season 3 with stronger form. In Season 2 (2025), he enjoyed a breakthrough campaign, scoring 226 runs in 10 matches to finish as the fourth-highest run-scorer. He combines aggression with control, posting a strike rate of 162.59 and hitting 16 sixes in Season 2. His performance peaked in a high-stakes clash against Majhi Mumbai, where he scored an unbeaten 50 to steer Chennai Singams to a crucial win.","The Indian Street Premier League (ISPL), India's trailblazing tennis-ball T10 cricket tournament, is set to illuminate Surat for Season 3.

In a major setback for India, ODI vice-captain Shreyas Iyer ’s return to competitive cricket has been delayed after the batter failed to receive the required clearance from the BCCI Centre of Excellence (CoE). As per the original plan, Iyer was expected to check out of the facility on December 30 but will now be spending at least a week more to get the Return to Play (RTP). While he continues to bat without any discomfort, the rapid weight loss due to the abdominal injury has pushed his strength below the optimum levels and a lot of attention will be paid on that in the coming week.Iyer has lost around 6 kgs due to the injury and while he has regained some of it, the drop in muscle mass has pushed his strength below optimum levels.""There is no problem with his batting but he lost around six kgs after the injury in Australia. While he has regained some weight, there has been a drop in muscle mass which has further affected his optimum strength levels. The medical team will not be taking any chances because he is a very important player in the ODI set up and his complete recovery is of utmost importance right now. The selectors and management will be conveyed about his present situation before they meet to pick team for New Zealand ODIs,"" a BCCI official tells TimesofIndia.com. As TimesofIndia.com had earlier reported , the right-hander was set to feature in the games on January 3 and 6 before the start of three-match ODI series in Vadodara on January 11 but there will be a late alteration as the right-hander is now expected to get the necessary clearances only by January 9 - two days before the New Zealand series starts and three days before knockouts of the Vijay Hazare Trophy.""There were a lot of positive developments as he batted in Mumbai, went to CoE and was pushing himself to feature in the New Zealand ODIs. There were indications of him playing the Vijay Hazare Trophy matches on January 3 and 6 too but we have now been told that he needs more time and will only be available from the knockout stages of the tournament,"" a MCA official tracking developments tells TimesofIndia.com.Iyer had already resumed training and regular gym work, and even had a hit in the nets a day before heading to the CoE on December 25. He spent six days undergoing numerous fielding, batting and fitness drills at the facility, and will continue to be there for more fitness work.The Vijay Hazare Trophy knockouts are scheduled from January 12 - a day after India play the first ODI vs New Zealand - and Iyer is now unlikely to make the cut for the last ODI bilateral before focus shifts to the T20 World Cup in India and Sri Lanka in the months of February and March.",ODI vice-captain Shreyas Iyer's return to competitive cricket has been delayed. Iyer failed to receive the required clearance from the BCCI Centre of Excellence (CoE) Iyer was expected to check out of the facility on December 30 but will now be spending at least a week more.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126251026,imgsize-264870,width-400,resizemode-4/australia-india-cricket.jpg"

RAW TALENTFancy a swig of raw milk? Good for your gut, and legs it seems. Head too. It’s superfood, just ask Super Haaland. He loves to visit a Cheshire farm to get his locally sourced bottles. And as you know, he rarely bottles up in front of goal – scoring 25 times in his 23 matches for City so far.

PSG’s success story in 2025 is one to behold -- How Luis Enrique rebooted the continent’s nearly men into European champions with discipline, teamwork, tactics, belief while deleting the individualist approach.All for one and one for all, Luis’ musketeers reeled in trophy after trophy but there was one battle PSG lost, to former talisman Kylian Mbappe, in the boardroom and the courtroom. In this sabre fencing, Paris employed the slashing technique, cutting off the Frenchman’s salary that included a so-called ‘ethics bonus’. Mad in Madrid, Mbappe’s riposte was of the legal kind. After the back and forth, the court ruled that the former employers pay up unpaid wages of 60m euros. Back in Spain, Mbappe earned some Real love from the Bernabeu faithful, after scoring 59 goals in 59 games, equaling his ‘hero’ Cristiano Ronaldo’s record, the most in a calendar year. How did he celebrate it? Siuuuuu…NO FAN’S LANDThe Big Leagues’ global expansion was put on hold. La Liga president Javier Tebas’ plan to ‘host’ a league match between Barcelona and Villarreal in Miami 7,500-km away from the shores of Spain was cancelled. The league had also chartered planes to take around 2,000 to 3,000 Villarreal fans to the US of A. In Oct, there were league-wide protests, stopping active play to express displeasure. Ultimately, Tebas had to bow down as organisers pulled out. Last week, a high-profile plan to stage a Serie A match -- AC Milan vs. Como -- in Perth was scrapped.DIAMONDS ARE FOREVEROne of the most viral pics of 2025 was of Georgina Rodriguez’s oversized diamond engagement ring reported to be valued between $2 and 5m, the kind of flashy display that one can associate with her fiancé Cristiano Ronaldo.

Ryan Rickelton press conference: 'Been tough last couple of months mentally in India'

Florian Wirtz's first Liverpool goal fired the Reds into the Premier League 's top four despite an unconvincing 2-1 win over Wolves on a day both clubs paid tribute to Diogo Jota . Jota, who was killed in a car accident alongside his brother Andre Silva in July, won four trophies after joining Liverpool from Wolves in 2020.Two of his children led the teams out as mascots, while his wife Rute Cardoso watched on from the sidelines.Both sets of fans sang chants in Jota's name in the 18th and 20th minutes -- the shirt numbers he wore during his spells at Molineux and Anfield respectively.""After the tragedy happened until now, I have seen so many special moments -- where the fans remembered him or our players conducted themselves unbelievably in the circumstances,"" said Liverpool boss Arne Slot.""Not only our fans but the fans of away teams have shown the respect both Diogo and his brother deserved. It was special to see his children being the mascot and how emotional it was before the game and then in the 20th minute.""On the field, both clubs have suffered this season with Wolves staring down the barrel of relegation after taking just two points from their opening 18 league games.Liverpool's form has improved of late and Wirtz is beginning to show flashes of the brilliance that lured the English champions into paying Bayer Leverkusen £100 million ($135 million) for the German international.The 22-year-old registered his first Premier League assist last weekend for a goal that came at some cost to Liverpool as Alexander Isak suffered a broken leg in opening the scoring against Tottenham.Shorn of the most expensive player in English football history for the coming months, there is even more pressure on Wirtz to deliver on his hefty price tag.""He's been very important for us throughout the season. But in football it is about results, you are mainly judged on results or on goals and assists,"" added Slot.""I think today he showed much more than just the goal he scored; he was special for us in many parts of the game.""Wirtz finally opened his account in his 23rd Liverpool appearance by prodding home Hugo Ekitike's pass to double the home side's lead.Just 90 seconds earlier, Liverpool had made the breakthrough when Ryan Gravenberch slammed in Jeremie Frimpong's cross.Yet, even with a 2-0 half-time lead against a side on course to become the worst in Premier League history, Slot could not relax.Santiago Bueno exposed Liverpool's frailty from set-pieces to pull a goal back just six minutes into the second half.Slot's men have made a habit of late collapses at Leeds and Tottenham in recent weeks and needed a perfectly-timed tackle from Conor Bradley to deny Jhon Arias a late equaliser.","Liverpool beat Wolves 2-1 in Premier League.

This year, most scrambled to check the Google Maps to find Curacao when the smallest-ever nation, in terms of population and size, qualified for next year’s mammoth World Cup 2026. With 155,000 inhabitants, the Caribbean island was guided to the top tier by Dick Advocaat, the former Rangers and PSV boss who has also worked with eight national teams including his native Netherlands (1992-94).Sebastian Migne never set foot on Haiti, another Caribbean nation, because international flights do not land there. They played all their World Cup home qualifiers in Curacao, some 500 miles across the sea.These football stories are the brightest beacon of 2025. In contrast, the darkness around Indian football seems to have grown deeper, unfathomable, with no light at the end of the tunnel.The year gone by has seen All India Football Federation officials spend more time making rounds of the courts than the national team spent on the field.It might delight a research scholar to know that AIFF has presented itself to the Supreme Court 16 times and counting.The national team has played only 12 matches. None of it, though, will bring cheer to the fans.Never since Independence has Indian football slipped into such a deep abyss. For the first time since 1996, when the national league was begun by then-AIFF president Priya Ranjan Das Munshi, it has stalled.One can say with a heavy heart that the league is an orphan now.The sponsorship ran out. The new occupants of Football House, who took charge in 2022, were aware of the matter. But the negotiations just refused to yield any money, assurance, or hope.Since 2010, the AIFF received Rs 50 crore every year from Football Sports Development Limited (FSDL), a Reliance Industries subsidiary, as part of an agreement. The 15-year contract ran out on Dec 8.It was obvious to all, except those in Football House, that no one wants to waste money to keep Indian football – once called a sleeping giant by Sepp Blatter just over a decade and a half ago – alive and awake.Till reports last came in, the AIFF plans to start the elite league around Feb 7-8 after presenting a 20-year plan to the ISL clubs. In accordance with the constitution, the league will be owned and operated by the AIFF and will “implement the principles of promotion and relegation.”“I am convinced we can start the league and then work out a long-term solution,” said IFA secy Anirban Dutta, a member of the committee to resolve the ISL crisis.All year, the stakeholders went into hair-splitting debates and nuanced offerings but the outcome, sadly, has been zero. Even a few clubs had temporarily stopped paying salaries to the players. There has been a frustrating sense of ennui.Last heard, there was some warmth shown by the beleaguered clubs towards the AIFF’s proposals. The format for a truncated league is expected to be confirmed in the year’s final week.Add to it the dismal performance of the national team. Hours after India lost to Bangladesh in their last Asian Cup qualification engagement, Haiti’s ticket to the World Cup sent euphoric shock waves around the world. To watch India’s matches this year, under coaches Manolo Marquez and Khalid Jamil, was like visiting the dentist with a severe toothache.The Indian senior men’s team failed to qualify for the 2027 AFC Asian Cup, which means no competitive football until at least Nov 2027. That is nearly three years without meaningful matches. One wonders what will be Khalid Jamil’s work schedule now?One question keeps haunting, though. If Curacao are able to hire the services of a world-renowned coach like Advocaat, why could India, claimed to be the fourth-largest economy in the world, never reach beyond the Manolos and the Stimacs and the Koevermans? One can keep waiting for an answer but there will only be silence from the All India Football Federation.Following some creditable performances against Bahrain (2-0) and Brunei (6-0), U-23 coach Naushad Moosa got stuck in Doha. Not one to be easily perturbed, even by the sudden bombing of the Qatari capital, Moosa showered rousing praise on the boys. But his enthusiasm was laced with bleakness.“What’s next for the boys? They will go back to their clubs and warm the bench. They won’t be getting any minutes,” he had said in Sept. With the U-17s, Bibiano Fernandes also made headlines by helping the boys cross the Asian Cup qualification hurdles.Repeating himself, Moosa confirmed his apprehensions in Dec. “Nothing is happening. The players too are sadly cooling their heels.” And we couldn’t but recall the days not too long ago, when the AIFF had to put a cap of 45 matches on the national team players.One may point out that these are silver linings. If so, then why can’t Manolo or Jamil do without Sunil Chhetri , India’s weather-beaten warhorse who is past 40? The striker had to break his retirement vows and don the India shirt again, confirming that Indian football’s cupboard is starkly bare.The year 2025 will stay in memory as the lowest point in Indian football.LEAGUE UNCERTAINTY: It’s the end of December, half-time in most football seasons, a time when clubs redraw their strategies, depending on the progress they’ve made in the league. This year, nothing. Indian football has never seen anything like this. There’s no word on the top tier ISL or the I-League, because the AIFF has simply failed to find a commercial partner. Everything’s at a standstill: clubs have paused first team operations, players have stopped training and many foreigners plan to move elsewhere once the transfer window opens on Jan 1. One club has told players they will have to “forego salaries” for months and they’d be “happy to resume payments” only from the date of restart.CAMPS WITHOUT PLAYERS: National team camps often kicked off without half the players. Coach Khalid Jamil wanted more time with the boys, but clubs refused to release players outside the FIFA international windows. It was no different for U-23 assignments. The trust deficit between the two parties has grown so much that Mohun Bagan SG, who have the maximum players at national camps, even accused the federation of negligence over the handling of their captain Subhashish Bose.MONUMENTAL FAILURE: In the 15 months between May 2024 and August 2025, the national team had three coaches — Igor Stimac, Manolo Marquez, Khalid Jamil — none of whom could ensure that India makes it to the AFC Asian Cup, the country’s first failure since the tournament was expanded to accommodate 24 teams. In the final round of qualifiers, India were the highest-ranked side but finished at the bottom, unable to register a single win and in five matches, scoring just twice. The defeat to Bangladesh in Dhaka, the first in 22 years, rankled the most.THE BIG EXIT: The City Football Group’s exit from Mumbai City FC was probably the biggest reflection of the mess that is Indian football. CFG, the world’s leading private owner and operator of 13 clubs, including Manchester City, had joined hands with Mumbai City with much fanfare. Their decision to divest its shareholding in the club is a huge blow. The reason: “CFG made this decision following a comprehensive commercial review and in light of the ongoing uncertainty surrounding the future of the Indian Super League (ISL). ”BUT, A SILVER LINING: The women’s team provided joy in an otherwise grim state. The senior team defied the odds to defeat World Cuppers Thailand and qualify for the AFC Asian Cup. The U-17 and U-20 teams also left India with three continental competitions to play for in the opening months of 2026. At club level, East Bengal’s SAFF Club Championship triumph and a first group stage win in the AFC Women’s Champions League brought cheer.UNDER MANOLO MARQUEZUNDER KHALID JAMILIndia won Bronze Medal at CAFA Nations CupTOTAL MATCHES: 11India Won: 3India Lost: 5Drawn: 3Goals Scored: 8Goals Conceded: 12","Indian football has slipped into such a deep abyss.

Rayan Cherki steals the show as Manchester City edge Nottingham Forest to go top of the Premier League,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/top-stories/rayan-cherki-steals-the-show-as-manchester-city-edge-nottingham-forest-to-go-top-of-the-premier-league/articleshow/126206283.cms,"Manchester City's Rayan Cherki celebrates with Erling Haaland (Barrington Coombs/PA via AP)

Rayan Cherki delivered another decisive statement of his growing influence at Manchester City as his late strike secured a 2-1 Premier League win over Nottingham Forest and lifted Pep Guardiola’s side to the top of the table on Saturday.The France international was at the heart of everything City did well at the City Ground. After setting up Tijjani Reijnders for the opening goal early in the second half, Cherki returned in the closing stages to fire home the winner, capping a standout display that underlined his importance to City’s title push.City had to weather sustained pressure from Forest, who matched Guardiola’s men for large spells and were level soon after falling behind. Omari Hutchinson, scoring his first goal for the club, punished a rare City mistake to bring the home side back into the contest and briefly threaten another memorable result against the champions.Guardiola’s team eventually found a way through, extending their winning run to eight matches in all competitions and six straight league victories. The result moved City one point clear of Arsenal, although the Gunners could reclaim top spot later in the day with a home win over Brighton.Before kick-off, Forest paid tribute to club legend John Robertson, who passed away on Christmas Day at the age of 72. The former Scotland winger was a central figure in Forest’s back-to-back European Cup triumphs in 1979 and 1980, and his flair and end product were fondly remembered by the City Ground crowd.Cherki, who joined City from Lyon in the summer, appears to share that same blend of creativity and cutting edge. At just 22, he has quickly become a key figure in Guardiola’s side and, should City edge Arsenal to the title, his contribution is likely to be pivotal.Guardiola had set a stern tone over the festive period, warning his players against excess and making it clear that fitness standards would not be compromised. He even cancelled a planned rest day after last weekend’s win over West Ham. When asked about his squad’s condition, Guardiola joked that he was the only one who had put on weight.Despite that discipline, City looked flat before the break and Forest had the better chances. Morgan Gibbs-White went close after meeting a Callum Hudson-Odoi cross, while City struggled to impose themselves. Erling Haaland, who has 19 league goals by Christmas, the joint-most at this stage in Premier League history, was largely kept quiet.The visitors finally found their rhythm just after the interval. Cherki drifted inside and slipped a clever pass to Reijnders, who finished calmly from 12 yards for City’s first shot on target. Cherki then tested goalkeeper John Victor with a fierce effort moments later.Forest responded swiftly. Reijnders lost possession near his own area, allowing Gibbs-White to release Igor Jesus, whose cross was drilled home by Hutchinson from close range. With City wobbling, Neco Williams forced Gianluigi Donnarumma into a save before Nicolo Savona blazed over from the rebound.The decisive moment arrived in the 83rd minute. A loose ball fell to Cherki just inside the box and the Frenchman lashed an unstoppable finish past Victor. He celebrated by mimicking Haaland’s trademark calm pose in front of the travelling supporters.It was a fitting end to a performance that highlighted why Cherki is fast becoming one of Guardiola’s most trusted match-winners as City continue their relentless pursuit of another Premier League crown.",Manchester City beat Nottingham Forest 2-1 at the City Ground.

The All India Football Federation (AIFF) on Friday proposed a new structure for the Indian Super League (ISL), under which the league would be owned and operated by the national body in accordance with its new constitution for the next 20 seasons.According to the new proposal the AIFF formulated after a meeting with the ISL clubs, the league will implement a promotion and relegation system from the upcoming season. Each season will be calculated from June 1 to May 31 of the next year.""We have sent the proposal to the clubs, we have to wait for their response in the next couple of days before finalising our plan,"" an AIFF source told PTI.""Let the clubs respond, we will try to find a solution after hearing them.""It is expected that the AIFF and the clubs will have two more rounds of meetings -- one on Sunday and the other on Monday.If all goes well, the ISL season may start in the first week of February, according to the source.According to the proposal, the ISL will have a predetermined 'Central Operational Budget' for every year that would come from yearly contributions from all 'revenue share holders' proportionate to their revenue share in the league.""This would be known as the 'League Membership Contribution'. Any operational expenses required for the league to be conducted and for clubs to comply with their applicable licensing criteria with the addition of prize money distribution would be capped and borne out of this budget,"" the proposal said.""Governance would be overseen by a Board that would be empowered by the AIFF general body with certain operational autonomy over commercial matters of the League. The jurisdiction of the board would be limited to the utilisation of unrestricted funds within the yearly operational budget earmarked for the same.""Each club, under the proposal, will pay the AIFF a 'standard participating fee' of Rs 1 crore a year at the beginning of the season. This would, however, be independent of any calculations of the 'Central Operating Expenditure'.""This amount would be fully reimbursable from the central revenue prior to distribution of 'Net Revenue'. The total participation fee for all clubs would be put at 20% of the 'central operational budget' of the League. In case the Board decides to raise the 'central operational budget' by 10% in the future, the 'standard participation fee' would proportionately increase.""Any profit, or savings from the operational budget, will be distributed equally amongst all revenue shareholders in proportion to the respective revenue shares.On December 20, a proposal from 10 ISL clubs for ""perpetual"" operational and commercial ownership of the country's top-tier competition failed to get the approval of the AIFF's General Body, which formed a committee to look into the matter.The AIFF panel was tasked with holding discussions with representatives of five clubs - Chennaiyin FC, Mumbai City FC, Delhi Sporting Club, NorthEast United FC and Mohun Bagan Super Giant from December 22 to 29.Under the AIFF's proposal, the total outlay of the first season of the ISL will be Rs 70 crore with the AIFF's revenue share pegged at 10 per cent (that is Rs 7 crore) in the first season, while 50 per cent (Rs 35 crore) will come from the clubs -- 14 as of now unless there is any pull out.But interestingly, a revenue share of 30 per cent has been reserved for a potential commercial partner. The AIFF is yet to get a commercial partner as it did not receive any bid after a tender was floated on the supervision of a Supreme Court-appointed committee under a retired SC judge.Though the AIFF has included a 30 per cent revenue share for a potential commercial partner in the proposal, it is learnt that since the number of matches this season could be less than earlier years, the ISL can be run with a 'central operating budget' of less than the proposed Rs 70 crore.",The All India Football Federation (AIFF) has proposed a new structure for the Indian Super League (ISL) The league would be owned and operated by the national body in accordance with its new constitution for the next 20 seasons.

RABAT: Organisers at the Africa Cup of Nations in Morocco are allowing supporters in for free after kick-off in matches where stadiums are not full, a Confederation of African Football source told AFP.The Group F game between Cameroon and Gabon on Wednesday in Agadir kicked off in front of almost empty stands but the ground filled up significantly over the course of the first half despite incessant rain.The official attendance was later announced as 35,200 inside a venue which can hold over 45,000.There have been similar scenes at numerous matches across the opening days of the competition, even leading to confusion over the attendance figures themselves.The crowd at Tuesday's Group D encounter between the Democratic Republic of Congo and Benin at Rabat's Al Medina Stadium -- which filled up considerably over the course of the game -- was initially announced as 6,703 before later being corrected to 13,073.The CAF source indicated that organisers, in agreement with African football's governing body, were opening stands around 20 minutes into games to allow fans gathered outside to enter without paying.Filling stadiums is an important issue for Cup of Nations organisers in Morocco, for which a successful hosting of the tournament is key as it builds towards the 2030 World Cup to be jointly held in the North African country, Spain and Portugal.CAF's official ticketing platform on Thursday showed seats available for almost all remaining group matches for prices starting at 100 dirhams ($10.96).The only matches shown as sell-outs were hosts Morocco's games against Mali on Friday and Zambia on Monday, as well as Algeria against Burkina Faso on Sunday and Algeria versus Equatorial Guinea next Wednesday.","Africa Cup of Nations organisers are allowing supporters in for free after kick- off in matches where stadiums are not full.

Where did it all go wrong for Indian football?

FC Goa players made a strong statement during their AFC Champions League 2 match against FC Istiklol by staging a silent protest before kick-off on Wednesday at the Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium.As the referee blew the whistle for kick-off, the FC Goa players staged the pre-planned protest and did not play for a few seconds.The protest was aimed at highlighting the “deepening uncertainty” that is affecting the Indian football ecosystem.Issues related to administration and commercial matters have caused major delays around top-tier domestic football competitions like the Indian Super League and the I-League.Players, coaches, and staff across clubs are feeling the impact of this situation.Soon after the incident, FC Goa released a statement on social media to explain their action.“This action was solely intended to draw attention to the broader challenges facing the domestic football ecosystem,” the club said in an official statement.FC Goa also made it clear that the protest was not against their opponents or the Asian Football Confederation.Instead, it was meant to show the frustration and concern felt by those involved in Indian football, who are unsure about the future of the game in the country.On the field, FC Goa started well despite the tense backdrop. The home team took the lead in the eighth minute when Dejan Drazic found space inside the box and scored with a fine curling shot into the top corner.In the second half, Istiklol made a strong comeback. A defensive mistake allowed Paul Komolafe to score the equaliser in the 53rd minute.Just three minutes later, another error led to a penalty, which Amirbek Juraboev converted to put the visitors ahead.FC Goa tried hard to score an equaliser, but their efforts did not succeed.Istiklol held on to win 2-1.

Lionel Messi India trip: Mumbai out in numbers for the superstar





No takers for game





Court hearings, President's appeal, sports ministry intervention





Women and juniors shine

NEW DELHI: Indian football remained in a state of terminal decline after experiencing arguably its darkest phase in a year marked by severe administrative crisis, court hearings, financial issues, absence of domestic leagues, and a steep decline in performance of the senior men's team.As the year drew to a close, the high-profile Lionel Messi GOAT India Tour generated some interest and forced a conversation around the sport.The much-publicised event did what it was meant to, and was not supposed to serve as a catalyst for real improvement in Indian football.If its own problems were not enough, the chaos and absolute disorder at Salt Lake Stadium on the first day of the Messi tour added to the embarrassment.While the breakdown of law and order in the 'Mecca of Indian football' was not good advertisement, the remaining three legs in Hyderabad, Mumbai and Delhi were well organised.Of the many disappointments, one on-field moment that still stings came when little-known Bangladeshi midfielder Sheikh Morsalin darted into the box and slipped the ball between the legs of Gurpreet Singh Sandhu with a delicate touch, completing another round of humiliation.The 11th minute strike, in an inconsequential 2027 AFC Asian Cup qualifying match on a November evening in Dhaka, meant the Indian senior men's team suffered its first defeat to Bangladesh in 22 years, after having struggled through the last 12 months to produce a result of any significance.While several factors contribute to a country's overall football ecosystem, globally the senior team's performance is often the most visible metric, and India was found severely wanting on that front.Unlike in 2024, when the team drew a blank in international matches, the Indian senior men's side did manage to churn out a few wins occasionally this year, including a bronze medal finish at the CAFA Nations Cup in the central Asian countries of Tajikistan and Uzbekistan in September.But, in the matches that mattered the most, India failed to deliver and could not qualify for the Asian Cup for the first time since the 2011 edition, following which the team plummeted further in the FIFA rankings.Besides Bangladesh, the team also suffered defeats to other lower-ranked opponents such as Hong Kong and Singapore, a 1-2 loss to whom dashed its hopes of entering the Asian Cup following a disappointing campaign in the Qualifications.While the men's team struggled on the field, especially when it came to scoring goals, the administrators grappled with issues off it.The game remained in the middle of a crisis due to the All India Football Federation's failure to secure a new commercial partner for the Indian Super League after its previous contract with the Reliance-owned Football Sports Development Limited (FSDL) expired on December 8.On expected lines, the lack of a commercial partner has had a crippling effect on the game. The ISL, which would have been into its third month now under normal circumstances, remains on hold.The sponsors are pulling out, clubs have put their operations on hold, players are staring at an uncertain future, after having implored each and every stakeholder to resolve the issue, and serious doubts hover over the domestic leagues' future.The ongoing crisis has highlighted a systemic failure in the country's football ecosystem brought about by poor governance, lack of long-term vision and the absence of proper youth development programmes.The year was also marked by frequent hearings at the Supreme Court and intervention from the union sports ministry to resolve the crisis. Even President Droupadi Murmu asked the stakeholders of Indian football to work together for the upliftment of the game in the country, reflecting the severity of the situation.When the Supreme Court approved the draft Constitution of the AIFF, prepared by former apex court judge L Nageswara Rao, in September, it was believed that a solution amenable to all concerned parties would finally be arrived at.However, no such thing happened in the ensuing months.Amid the gloom surrounding the sport, the women's national teams and the junior squads have impressed with their performances, raising hopes of a better future. In Chiang Mai, Thailand in July, the women's team scripted history by qualifying directly for the AFC Women's Asian Cup 2026, a feat never achieved before.Up against regional heavyweights and hosts Thailand in the final, the Indian women rode on Sangita Basfore's brilliant brace to emerge winners and make a statement of sorts. The achievement reminded one of former AIFF president Praful Patel's old statement that chances of the Indian women's team playing in a FIFA World Cup before their male counterparts are higher.While the girls still have a long way to go, they are definitely moving in the right direction.In another milestone, Indian Women's League reigning champions East Bengal FC became the first team from the country to win a main-draw match in the AFC Women's Champions League, helping the side earn a direct spot in the league stages of the next edition.As far as the junior teams were concerned, the India squad lifted its seventh SAFF U-17 Championship title in Sri Lanka, edging out Bangladesh in a dramatic final that went to penalties after a 2-2 stalemate.Under the guidance of Bibiano Fernandes, India then shocked continental giants Iran 2-1 to qualify for their 10th U-17 Asian Cup finals, even as the struggle to monetise the sport continued without a solution in sight.",Indian football remained in a state of terminal decline after experiencing arguably its darkest phase in a year marked by severe administrative crisis.

Zac Taylor future sparks growing divide in Cincinnati



Zac Taylor has become the loudest name echoing through Cincinnati, not from the sideline but from the stands. Frustration has spilled beyond social media and into the stadium itself, where one fan’s blunt message turned into a flashpoint. Wearing a T-shirt that read “Fire Zac Taylor,” the supporter was allegedly removed by team security, a moment that only sharpened the sense that voices inside Paycor Stadium are being muted. For a fanbase starving for accountability, that image carried more weight than any loss on the scoreboard.The anger did not appear overnight. Cincinnati sits at 4-9 entering Week 16, and patience has thinned after three straight seasons without playoff football. The Super Bowl run that once defined belief now feels distant. What stings most is not just losing, but the feeling that nothing will change, even as the roster still features a franchise quarterback in his prime.Despite the noise outside, the tone inside the building appears steady. NFL Network insiders Tom Pelissero and Ian Rapoport reported that the organization is not gearing up for sweeping change. “Despite a third straight non-playoff season and quarterback Joe Burrow 's recent musings about the future, there are no signs the Bengals are preparing to make major changes,” Rapoport and Pelissero said.“Coach Zac Taylor has two years left on his contract, and all indications are that Taylor should return.”That stance clashes sharply with public emotion. Cincinnati once looked like a perennial AFC threat under Burrow, but recent weeks have fueled speculation about his long term outlook. Burrow later clarified that his comments were not aimed at the franchise, yet the unease lingers. It reflects a wider fear that stability is turning into stagnation.Adding to the confusion was a report from The Athletic’s Paul Dehner Jr., revealing Taylor is under contract through 2027, longer than most fans believed. To outsiders, the Bengals do not resemble a team on the verge of firing its head coach. Financial reality supports that view, as moving on would mean paying out guaranteed deals across the entire staff.Still, former coach Bruce Arians injected another layer of intrigue. “Whoever wins it gets to stay,” Arians said on The Pat McAfee Show. “Now if they don't, the way s**** has been going in Pittsburgh, big win last week. But my pick last week was the Bengals. And damn, they had it too. They had it up in Buffalo, and the man pulled out his cape, Josh Allen. But yeah, I think this division is gonna go right to the last game, and again at least three guys could be gone. ”For now, Zac Taylor remains. But if the season ends quietly, the tension between loyalty and results may only grow louder.Also Read: Matthew Stafford vs. Drake Maye MVP race heats up as Ex-NFL star breaks down why the LA Rams QB’s experience gives him the edge","Zac Taylor has become the loudest name echoing through Cincinnati, not from the sideline but from the stands.

Dan Orlovsky breaks down why Matthew Stafford still deserves NFL MVP honors over rising star Drake Maye



NFL MVP race conversations have shifted quickly, and Drake Maye now sits at the center of a debate that refuses to settle quietly. Numbers, wins, and timing have pushed the Patriots quarterback into the spotlight, even as Matthew Stafford’s rough night lingered in voters’ minds. Yet the race is far from decided, especially with one influential voice refusing to follow the crowd.Maye’s rise has felt steady and confident, driven by clean execution and control rather than flash. He has turned New England into a weekly problem for opponents, stacking wins and efficiency while keeping mistakes low. That balance has pulled attention away from Stafford’s brilliance, even though the Rams quarterback still owns some of the loudest numbers of the season. The contrast has created a debate that goes deeper than box scores.Dan Orlovsky believes context should carry real weight in the NFL MVP race, and he made that clear on “The Pat McAfee Show.” Drawing from his years as Stafford’s teammate, Orlovsky acknowledged Maye’s excellence while standing firm in his pick.“One, if I was voting today, I would vote for Stafford. I think Drake Maye’s season this year I really believe is up there with as good a second-year performance a quarterback has had in the NFL.I think it’s a lot on par with what Joe [Burrow] did a couple years ago when he took Cincy to the playoffs and to the Super Bowl,” Orlovsky said.He then challenged how fans and analysts treat statistics without examining the road taken to earn them.“This is what I would say: For everybody that continues to point stats to me, OK, and I understand stats, context, all that, you guys all wanna talk about stats. You can’t in one hand talk about the stats and in the other conversation, ‘Well, who he did it against doesn’t matter.’ Yes, it does.“How you acquire the stats and who you acquire those stats against has to be a part of the conversation, and it doesn’t mean we have to knock people for it, but it has to provide context in how those stats were acquired. If I went right now and played high school football, I would be ridiculous. Now, if I played in the NFL, I would be awful. So, who you do it against has to matter.”When Darius Butler pushed back, Orlovsky sharpened the point.“I understand it’s different leagues, but, OK, so, if you took a quarterback and you played him against Seattle’s defense on a consistent basis and then you took a quarterback and played him against the Jets defense on a consistent basis, one quarterback is gonna have better stats because of that defense he’s playing against.“Or, if you took the same quarterback, had him play against Seattle, had him play against the Jets 10 times in a row, you’re gonna perform better against the Jets than you did against Seattle.”With one week left, Maye owns momentum and favorable odds. Stafford owns Orlovsky’s vote and a tougher résumé. That tension is exactly what keeps this MVP race alive.Also Read: What happens next for Stefon Diggs?

Brett Favre Parkinson’s update highlights early-stage reality

Brett Favre Parkinson’s update arrived with honesty and clarity, reflecting the mindset of a quarterback who built his career on toughness and transparency. One year after revealing his diagnosis, the Pro Football Hall of Famer is not hiding from the reality of the disease. Instead, Favre is explaining what it means for his daily life and how his body responds as time goes on.Favre shared the update during a recent episode of his 4th and Favre podcast, offering fans a window into how Parkinson’s has affected him physically, but not yet mentally. The former Packers star spoke calmly and without drama, choosing education over fear. His words carried weight because they came from lived experience, not speculation.During the podcast, Brett Favre explained the specific form of Parkinson’s he has and how it differs from common assumptions. ""I'm in the early stages of Parkinson's,"" Favre said. ""I thought there was one Parkinson's, and that was it. There's not. There's multiple, many forms of Parkinson's, and I have what's called idiopathic, which is the most common. And I think the other thing that most people, when they hear Parkinson's, they think of shaking.... I have very little shaking. I have some, but it's pretty rare.""As I've learned, the Parkinson's that I have has three different characteristics, and one of those three is you'll have as the dominant side effect whatever, it's cognitive, and memory is one; shaking and tremors is two; and rigidity and stiffness is three. I major in the rigidity and stiffness.""Favre also addressed the long-term outlook with realism rather than false hope. ""When I get fatigued, maybe mainly towards the end of the day, I do shake a little bit, but my cognitive memory part of it is not right now,"" Favre said. ""It's OK, but as you well know, there's no cure. I hear, you know, from time to time, well, they're five years away from a cure. I hope that's the case. I really do. But I'm not holding my breath.""Later appearances revealed how he manages symptoms through frequent medication. ""I can only imagine what I look like, but I feel like a pretzel,"" Favre said. ""Everything is so rigid. I take the medicine, and 20 minutes later, at least in my mind, it's like a total new body.""For a player who defined durability in the NFL , this chapter is different. Yet Favre’s voice remains steady, grounded, and focused on facing the challenge head-on.Also Read: Brett Favre slams NFL for choosing Bad Bunny for Super Bowl halftime, says league should “pick someone who loves our country”","Brett Favre shared a candid update on his Parkinson's disease one year after revealing his diagnosis.

Trevon Diggs faces uncertain but flexible next step



Trevon Diggs stood at the center of the Cowboys’ defensive plans not long ago, a playmaker trusted to change games with instinct and nerve. On Tuesday, that chapter closed abruptly. Dallas decided to waive the veteran cornerback, ending a relationship that once symbolized confidence in youth, swagger, and long term belief. The move landed quietly but carried weight across the league, especially given Diggs’ recent contract history and name recognition.The decision did not come out of nowhere. Tension had lingered for months, fueled by frustration over injuries, recovery timelines, and availability. Dallas weighed performance against potential and chose a clean break before the season’s final week. For Diggs, it marked a sharp pivot point at age 27, when careers often demand clarity more than patience.The financial mechanics explain why this release feels calculated rather than emotional. Any team claiming Diggs on waivers would have to absorb his remaining $472,222 game check, plus $58,823 if he suits up in Week 18. NFL Network’s Tom Pelissero noted that this obligation “makes it likely he clears waivers and then will become a free agent.”That outcome gives Diggs control without delay, allowing him to sign immediately rather than wait for the new league year.There is also no guaranteed money left on his deal beyond this season, a detail that made Dallas comfortable acting now. One source told ESPN’s Todd Archer the release stemmed from “a culmination of events, including performance.” Archer added that Diggs was “likely a candidate to be released after the season, which would have opened up roughly $12 million in cap space” for the Cowboys. The front office simply chose timing over optics.Injuries shaped much of Diggs’ recent story. He opened the year on the Physically Unable to Perform list following January knee surgery, then battled a second knee issue and a concussion from an at home incident. In eight games, he logged 25 tackles without a pass breakup or interception, a stark contrast to his All Pro peak.Still, league evaluators remember the corner who once led the NFL with 11 interceptions and changed coverage plans every Sunday. Diggs has hired David Mulugheta to guide the next phase, signaling intent rather than retreat. For a player with proven ball skills and renewed freedom, this exit may feel less like an ending and more like a reset waiting to be claimed.Also Read: Patrick Mahomes and Brittany’s daughter Golden flaunts balance and beautiful hair in sweet moment",Trevon Diggs was released by the Dallas Cowboys on Tuesday.

Kylie Kelce criticizes Jason Kelce as Eagles fandom crosses a line

Kylie Kelce criticizes Jason Kelce not out of frustration, but out of love, humor, and a shared understanding of how deep Eagles loyalty runs in their household. Even after retirement, Jason Kelce still watches Philadelphia games like the outcome rests on his shoulders. That passion has not faded. If anything, it has evolved into something louder, funnier, and occasionally over the line.For Kylie, Eagles losses hit close to home too. She has lived every high and low alongside Jason, even now that his playing days are behind him. During a recent episode of New Heights, she revealed a superstition she turns to when things go wrong. She physically turns away from the television, hoping her sacrifice might help the team.Kylie Kelce explained, “There's only so much control you have, and it's what you can do,” adding that it felt like “a selfless act” because she wanted to watch the game “so badly.”That admission sparked a playful but telling exchange. Jason quickly leaned into the idea, asking, “So the Eagles are still losing. How can we up this sacrifice?” Travis Kelce jumped in with a joke, suggesting, “black out the games.” Jason escalated the humor even further, saying, “I was going like, animal sacrifice? That's what went in my head.”Kylie was not amused. “Why do you always take it one step too far?” she asked, clearly stunned by how quickly the moment spiraled. Travis pushed again, asking what animal might be sacrificed, which led Jason to jokingly answer, “a cat.” Laughter followed, but Kylie rolled her eyes, signaling enough was enough. Travis then drew a line himself, telling his brother, “That was uncalled for.”Moments like these have made the Kelces fan favorites beyond football. The mix of honesty, teasing, and real boundaries feels relatable. It also shows how seriously Jason still takes the Eagles, even as an analyst and former player.With Philadelphia leading the NFC East at 11 and 5, Kylie has endured only a few losses this season.

Stefon Diggs felony charges overshadow Patriots season



Stefon Diggs felony charges have once again pulled the Patriots wide receiver into the center of an uncomfortable spotlight, this time blending serious legal trouble with eyebrow-raising social media behavior. It is during a time when the issue of discretion can count for a lot, that the latest Instagram efforts on the part of Diggs, have become the subject of intense discussion throughout the NFL community and wider.The disconnect between the seriousness of the charges and the light ambience of the posts made by Diggs on the web has raised eyebrows nevertheless in this case, where legal issues are floating around with no definitive matters set.The situation stems from an alleged incident on December 2, which led to Diggs facing a felony strangulation or suffocation charge along with a misdemeanor assault count.While the case details remain limited due to a sealed incident report, Diggs’ decision to share memes about dating a “latina” woman during this period has drawn widespread attention and mixed reactions. Some see it as tone-deaf. Others argue social media should not be treated as evidence of guilt or intent.The Patriots have publicly stood by their receiver, stressing that Diggs has denied the allegations. In a statement that remains central to the team’s stance, the franchise said: “The New England Patriots are aware of the accusations that have been made regarding Stefon Diggs,” the team said. “Stefon has informed the organization that he categorically denies the allegations.“We support Stefon. We will continue to gather information and will cooperate fully with the appropriate authorities and the NFL as necessary. Out of respect for all parties involved, and given that this is an ongoing legal matter, we will have no further comment at this time.”Legally, the road ahead remains uncertain. Diggs’ court arraignment has reportedly been pushed back, giving both sides more time as the process unfolds. At the field, he is still productive, yet the overall discussion has considerably expanded beyond catches and yardage. This reminds about the speed of the social change in the situation when personal decisions, online presence and the grave accusations meet in the contemporary NFL.Also Read: Cardi B makes bold game day appearance as Stefon Diggs takes the field for New England","Stefon Diggs is facing a felony strangulation or suffocation charge and a misdemeanor assault allegation related to a reported December 2 incident.

“He's been unbelievable”: Shannon Sharpe applauds Stefon Diggs’ leadership months after his yacht controversy,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/hes-been-unbelievable-shannon-sharpe-applauds-stefon-diggs-leadership-months-after-his-yacht-controversy/articleshow/126252585.cms,"Seven months after a yacht controversy raised questions about his judgment, Stefon Diggs has reshaped his narrative in New England. Shannon Sharpe praised the wide receiver’s leadership and production, crediting a direct conversation with coach Mike Vrabel and Diggs’ on-field performance. Diggs helped the Patriots clinch the AFC East and earned praise for elevating quarterback Drake Maye.

Shannon Sharpe calls Stefon Diggs ‘sensational’ after months of criticism

Seven months after the yacht video first went viral, the conversation around Stefon Diggs has shifted in a way few expected. What once raised questions about judgment and fit has now become a case study in how performance can change narratives. The Patriots took a calculated risk by handing Diggs a major contract, and time has slowly reframed that decision.The noise around the pink powder incident lingered well into the offseason, especially with a new coaching staff trying to establish standards. Yet as the season unfolded, Diggs let his play speak. The controversy faded into context, replaced by weekly production and a growing sense of accountability inside the locker room.When New England signed Diggs in March, expectations were high and scrutiny followed immediately. By May, concerns centered on culture and leadership. Now, with the Patriots sitting atop the AFC East, those early doubts feel distant, even if they are not forgotten.Shannon Sharpe addressed that shift directly while speaking on “Nightcap,” offering praise that carried weight because it acknowledged both sides of Diggs’ year.“Stefon Diggs has been playing out of his mind,” Sharpe said. “You know what I love? I love Mike Vrabel had that conversation with him earlier in the year. Y'all doing all that stuff. He's like, 'Look that didn't why he brought you here for bro.'”Sharpe did not stop there. “He's been sensational. He's been unbelievable. ... Stef, congratulations bro. You've been playing out your damn mind. Whatever the incentives were in your contract bro, I hope you get every last one of them, cause you've been playing your a** off.”Coach Mike Vrabel had addressed the situation months earlier, keeping his tone measured. “Obviously, we want to make great decisions on and off the field,” Vrabel said. “So the message will be the same for all the players. Try to make great decisions. Any conversation that I've had with Steffon will remain between him and I.”On the field, Diggs delivered. Through 16 games, he recorded 970 receiving yards and four touchdowns, helping New England clinch the division. He also praised quarterback Drake Maye after Week 17, saying, “No, I did not. He surprised all of us… I look forward to seeing more.”In the end, Diggs did not erase the controversy. He outplayed it.Also Read: Cardi B fires back at critics as Stefon Diggs faces backlash for spending Christmas with his kids from his ex-girlfriends",Shannon Sharpe says Stefon Diggs has been playing out of his mind.

Jason Kelce rips Josh Allen for rushed throw on failed two-point try in Bills’ one-point loss to Eagles,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/jason-kelce-rips-josh-allen-for-rushed-throw-on-failed-two-point-try-in-bills-one-point-loss-to-eagles/articleshow/126252442.cms,"Jason Kelce offered blunt criticism of Josh Allen after the Bills lost 13 to 12 to the Eagles, pointing to a rushed throw on a failed two point conversion. Allen admitted he missed the play and took responsibility. Despite the loss, Buffalo clinched a playoff spot, though concerns remain about late game execution heading into postseason play.

Jason Kelce criticism of Josh Allen highlights late game execution

The final seconds in Philadelphia left little room for nuance, and the missed two point conversion quickly became the defining moment of the Bills’ one point loss. Josh Allen had already carried Buffalo back into the game with his legs, but the final throw told a harsher story. The play lingered into the following day, turning a narrow defeat into a league wide talking point.What kept the moment alive was not the miss itself, but how directly it was addressed. Former Eagles center Jason Kelce offered an unfiltered breakdown that reflected how players see mistakes when the margin is razor thin. His comments shifted the conversation from sympathy to accountability.Buffalo’s loss came after a strange night. Allen struggled early, then surged late with two rushing touchdowns that gave the Bills a chance to steal the game. The failed conversion erased that effort and handed Philadelphia a 13 to 12 win. While the Bills still secured a playoff spot, the ending exposed how little separates success from regret.Speaking on NFL on ESPN, Kelce did not soften his assessment. “He did (rush the throw),” Kelce said. “To his credit, he was pressured a little bit. ... I guarantee he's watching that and he knows himself, 'Damn, I got to make that throw.'” The remark landed because it echoed what many quarterbacks admit privately after film review.Allen did not deflect blame either. After the game, he said, “Yeah, I just missed. It just comes down to us executing, making one more play than they did. And obviously you saw that we didn't make that last play.” The honesty matched the moment and reinforced his leadership.Outside voices were less forgiving. Colin Cowherd questioned Buffalo’s postseason ceiling, saying, “I think Denver will beat them (the Bills). I think Jacksonville would beat them… Yeah, I can see the Buffalo being a one-and-done team. I've had them in the Herd Hierarchy around 8,9,10. It's just hard for me.”Still, context matters. Allen finished the season with 3,668 passing yards, 25 passing touchdowns, and 14 rushing scores. The Bills ranked among the league’s best offenses. The missed throw hurt, but the larger test now shifts to whether Buffalo can respond when the stakes rise again in January.Also Read: Patrick Mahomes’ injury recovery takes powerful turn as teen fighting rare disease steps up to inspire him","Jason Kelce offered blunt criticism of Josh Allen after the Bills lost 13 to 12 to the Eagles.

Like father, like son. NFL legend Deion Sanders became the NFL Draft’s first fashion icon by wearing a monochrome tracksuit and glistening gold jewelry when the Atlanta Falcons picked him fifth overall in 1989. Years later, his son, Shedeur Sanders, wore a massive ‘Legendary’ chain reportedly worth over $100K to the 2025 NFL Draft.Cleveland Browns rookie quarterback Shedeur Sanders is known for his extravagant jewelry collection, from the 2025 NFL Draft to his popular watch flex celebration [particularly flashing a custom-made Audemars Piguet Royal Oak 15500 diamond watch].By late 2025, the former Colorado Buffaloes signal caller’s net worth was estimated at about $8 million, earned through major NIL deals in college and his rookie contract with Cleveland. Now, let’s look at his jewelry collection.Designed by Tajia Diamonds, the “Legendary” chain is a massive, diamond-encrusted custom piece created in 48 hours. The chain reportedly costs $100K. The statement piece features 71.7 carats of VVS diamonds, with 43.5 carats in a custom Cuban link chain and a 28.2-carat diamond pendant spelling out “Legendary.” The large iced-out silver chain also features his personal brand, $$2.Back in his Colorado Buffaloes days, Sanders wore a thin, square-blocked diamond chain with a comparatively small “Legendary” pendant. “Legendary” was written in a Microsoft Word art font.Sanders later switched to a double-layered, thick diamond silver chain with a “2” pendant reportedly made by Saki Diamonds. “2” was his college football jersey number. Then came a thick Cuban link diamond chain with a heavily diamond-encrusted “$$” pendant. He once shared a photo on Instagram with a silver Cuban link choker chain with no pendant.The customized stainless steel Audemars Piguet Royal Oak 15500 watch features 30 carats of VVS diamonds. It is made by Saki Mihalakos, owner of Saki Diamonds, a Jacksonville-based jewelry company. Without diamonds, it reportedly costs $27,800, and with diamonds, the price rises to $70K.In one of his Instagram posts, where Sanders wears the pendant “2” diamond chain, he also shows off this watch. The signal caller bought this watch in 2022 when he played college football for Jackson State.“That’s my watch on his wrist,” Saki Mihalakos said via Complex Sports in Sept. 2023. “It’s beautiful to see my piece on that stage, but it doesn’t happen like that as if you’re not good to that person. I’m grateful to be a part of that.I’m grateful for the attention that it’s caught, and the beauty of it all is that it goes along with the vision I had for Saki Diamonds, to build not just a nationwide brand but a global brand.”Also Read: “Tip toed all around that question”: Tom Brady took a moment of silence before speaking on Cleveland Browns rookie QB Shedeur Sanders",Cleveland Browns rookie quarterback Shedeur Sanders is known for his extravagant jewelry collection.

A new beginning for Gisele Bündchen and Tom Brady

Gisele Bündchen and Tom Brady have officially entered a new chapter this holiday season, proving that life after a high-profile divorce can be both peaceful and transformative. While the former NFL star spent his Christmas Eve bonding with his eldest son on a golf course in the Bahamas, Gisele is celebrating her first holidays as a newlywed once again.The Brazilian supermodel quietly tied the knot with her jiu-jitsu instructor, Joaquim Valente, in an intimate ceremony earlier this month.This milestone follows a monumental year for Bündchen, who welcomed a baby boy with Valente in February 2025. As the year winds down, the focus remains on the family’s evolution and the steady co-parenting relationship she maintains with her ex-husband.Three years after their 2022 split, the former couple appears to have found a stable rhythm. Brady recently showed his support for the mother of his children, including her in a heartfelt Mother's Day tribute that highlighted the ""incredible moms"" in his life.The message, which featured Gisele alongside his own mother and Bridget Moynahan, underscored the mutual respect they have cultivated despite their separate paths.The journey to this harmony was not without its hurdles.In late 2022, shortly after their decision to part ways, Bündchen returned to her roots in Brazil to heal. Sharing a glimpse of that first solo holiday, she posted photos of her children riding horses and singing karaoke, capturing the essence of her homeland with a moving sentiment: “Where everything that is planted grows and what blooms the most is love,” she wrote.“Always so good to be back home❤️.”Their divorce was a choice made with grace, as Brady noted at the time of their announcement: ""We arrived at this decision to end our marriage after much consideration. Doing so is, of course, painful and difficult, like it is for many people who go through the same thing every day around the world. However we wish only the best for each other as we pursue whatever new chapters in our lives that are yet to be written.""Today, those ""new chapters"" are in full bloom.

Los Angeles Lakers throws surprise a birthday celebration for LeBron James

LeBron James’ 41st birthday sparks reflection inside the Los Angeles Lakers locker room

The Los Angeles Lakers transformed a regular practice day into a big locker-room party for LeBron James ’ 41st birthday. The Lakers' practice session at Crypto.com Arena quickly turned into a celebration that showed the team’s bond and admiration for its longest-serving player. A well-orchestrated surprise, featuring cake, singing, and lots of laughter, provided James with a rare break in the midst of a tough season.The reaction spoke volumes. Grins appeared, cameras were rolling, and teammates gathered around, making the moment feel more like a family gathering than a franchise event. It wasn’t flashy or overly staged. It was intimate. The celebration gave a peek into how much James still matters to the team and why even the simplest actions around him hold significance.The celebrations began right after the Lakers finished their practice at the Crypto.com Arena. Head coach JJ Redick took the lead by unveiling a two-layer birthday cake that had special touches celebrating James' legendary ""King"" nickname. On top of that cake was a golden crown and displayed an image of James' personal brand logo.Rookie forward Adou Thiero took the spotlight next, grabbing a mic to sing ""Happy Birthday to You"" in front of the whole team.Chris Mañon, another rookie, joined in the fun, adding his voice to the birthday wishes. They caught the moment on video, which went viral, perfectly capturing the team's playful spirit.As the song came to an end, James' teammates rushed in for hugs and cheers, making the birthday boy laugh as he tried to break free. ""Get off,"" James said to his teammates, grinning widely during the hug fest. The official Lakers Instagram account later shared the video with the caption, “Squad celebrated the King’s birthday after practice.”The celebration gave James a short break, as he's been juggling serious training with team bonding for a while now. It showed how much his teammates respect him, especially since he's stepping into his 23rd season — a real nod to his professionalism in a league where staying power is hard to come by.James' birthday got his Lakers teammates thinking about how he keeps shining at 41. Center Jaxson Hayes chatted with Olympics.com before the Pistons game and credited James' careful routine as the key to his ongoing success.“Definitely his preparation. I’ve never seen someone so prepared. He has his whole schedule lined up, he sticks to it every day. He’s the first one in the gym every day, and that’s just a testament to him and how great of a player he is,” Hayes said.Hayes mentioned something that really resonated with the team about James' impact. The forward's habit of showing up early and putting in the work sets a benchmark that inspires everyone, contributing to the camaraderie displayed during the birthday surprise. Coach JJ Redick, who was born in the same year as James, provided a different but relatable viewpoint during a media session the day before the celebration.“I have trouble getting out of bed in the morning and got to get an injection on my knee. My body is old and broken. It’s like that [maxim]: If you don’t use it, you lose it. And once I stopped using it, I lost it all.”James talked about his ongoing fight with age in a post-practice interview two days ago, mentioning a Nike ad series where he takes on ""Father Time."" “When I did the father of time commercial thing, I’m in a battle with him, and I would like to say that I’m kicking his ass on the back nine,” James joked with ESPN's Dave McMenamin, making everyone laugh with his golf analogy.These conversations took place before the birthday, giving us a better understanding of why the team's gesture seemed so heartfelt. At 41, James is still the emotional backbone of the Lakers, mixing his veteran experience with his powerful performance on the court.Also Read: Ben Simmons reportedly puts his NBA return on hold after earning $270 million in contracts for a surprising reason","Los Angeles Lakers throw surprise a birthday celebration for LeBron James.

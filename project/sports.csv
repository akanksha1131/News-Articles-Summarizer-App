Bangladesh cricket in turmoil: What it means for the T20 World Cup?

Poll Do you agree with the ICC's decision to replace Bangladesh with Scotland? Yes, it was the right decision. No, Bangladesh should have participated.

NEW DELHI: The Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) has confirmed it will not challenge the International Cricket Council’s decision to replace Bangladesh with Scotland in the upcoming ICC Men’s T20 World Cup, ending weeks of uncertainty and controversy surrounding the tournament.BCB media committee chairman Amzad Hossain made the announcement after a board meeting in Dhaka on Saturday, firmly stating that the board has accepted the ICC’s ruling and will not pursue any form of arbitration or dispute resolution, according to a report on ESPNCricinfo.“We have accepted the decision of the ICC board,” Amzad said. “Since the ICC has said that we cannot go and play or they cannot shift our games to Sri Lanka, in this case we cannot go and play in India. Our position remains the same. We are not going to any separate arbitration or anything here.”Bangladesh’s withdrawal follows the government’s refusal to clear the national team for travel to India, citing concerns over player security. At an ICC Board meeting last week, Bangladesh were informed that failure to travel would result in replacement, a message the BCB subsequently relayed to the government.“After the ICC board meeting, there was a cabinet meeting of the Bangladesh government and a decision was made there,” Amzad said.“The decision clearly stated that our team will not be able to go to India. This decision has been communicated by the government.”According to Amzad, the ICC then gave the BCB a 24-hour deadline to confirm participation. “We told them politely that it is not possible for us to go and play according to this fixture,” he added.Contrary to reports, Amzad clarified that the BCB never approached the ICC’s dispute resolution committee. With Bangladesh declining to participate, the ICC moved swiftly to replace them with Scotland, the highest-ranked T20I side outside the original qualification list.The ICC, in its internal assessments, maintained that there was no credible security threat to the Bangladesh team in India and stressed the importance of protecting the integrity and schedule of the global event. After Bangladesh failed to confirm participation within the stipulated deadline, the governing body acted in line with its qualification and governance processes.During Saturday’s meeting, the BCB was also informed that board director Ishtiaque Sadeque had resigned, citing personal reasons, adding another layer of upheaval to a turbulent chapter for Bangladesh cricket.","Bangladesh Cricket Board will not challenge ICC's decision to replace them with Scotland.

Poll Do you believe the Sunrisers Eastern Cape can maintain their winning streak next season? Yes, they have a strong team. No, other teams will catch up.

On December 30, 2025, former South Africa seamer Dale Steyn made a bold declaration on social media. ""SEC [Sunrisers Eastern Cape] are def [definitely] one of my finalists. Possibly even champions again. But let's come back to this in two weeks. "" It wasn't an outlandish bet to make. They had been to the final three times in three seasons, winning two.As they booked a place in the final once again, for the fourth straight time, Steyn wrote, ""Surprise. Surprise. SEC in the FINAL, again.""A little over three weeks after Steyn's original prediction, SEC were on the field against the Pretoria Capitals at Newlands in Cape Town. The task at hand for the Tristan Stubbs-led side was to chase down 159 runs.The World Cup-bound Stubbs, who had a mediocre campaign, had Matthew Breetzke for company. The job was difficult: 56 runs needed in 24 balls. Lizaad Williams and Lungi Ngidi, who had gone for a paltry six an over, each had an over.Steyn was worried and the confidence in the SEC was shaky. ""SEC may have left this a little late. New champions on route,"" he posted.What transpired, however, was a remarkable turnaround. Stubbs, who was included in the T20 World Cup squad only because of injuries in the camp, played a captain's knock, turning a 35 off 28 balls into an unbeaten 62 runs off 41 balls. Breetzke was equally impressive, pulling off a 49-ball, 68-run knock.Even if Dewald Brevis' 101-run knock in the first innings earned him the Player of the Match award, Stubbs-Breetzke's 114-run partnership for the fifth wicket took SEC to their fourth title.Let that register fully. Four years, four finals and three titles. This is stuff of sporting dynasties. Like Perth Scorchers who won their sixth Big Bash League (BBL) title in 15 seasons on Sunday. In American sports, think the Boston Celtics, Chicago Bulls, the New York Yankees and the New England Patriots. You get the idea.What's the secret? ""I think we've got a very well-balanced team. No disrespect to others but I think we've probably got the most balanced of teams. We've got good spin, we've got good pace and high-quality batters and an experienced opening pair,"" said coach Adrian Birrell in an unprecedented press conference that assembled the entire playing XI.""I think we probably were the side that played the least number of players. Didn't chop and change, which is very hard on the bench, but we've got a fantastic bench that could have played and they were really high-quality players, which gave me as coach a lot of confidence. But I think we've got a really good squad here and I think that showed this year that we were probably the most consistent team,"" continued the former South Africa national team assistant coach.The numbers back that claim. SEC had topped the table this season. They also had the most bonus points in the league stage. Zooming out across the four seasons, SEC has the most wins, holds the best win-loss ratio and scored the most runs.From Aiden Markram earlier to Tristan Stubbs now, the leadership duties have been handled perfectly. And Stubbs has found a perfect ally in Quinton de Kock to lean on for support when required. But the decision to pass the captaincy armband to 'Stubbo', who has only had one strong season for the franchise (2024), speaks highly of their preference for building a team rather than highlighting individuals.""I've really enjoyed this month,"" said Stubbs in reflection of the season. ""I've had a great group to work with. We've planned really well for games. The bowlers are really experienced, so it's been easy. Me and Quinny [Quinton de Kock] have had this great thing going where we channelled a lot of the bowling changes. It's been a whole team effort. The senior players have been awesome. It's awesome to finish like this.""As the beers were passed around in the room to culminate another trophy-laden season, a look back at the start cannot be ignored.At the auction, the Sunrisers Eastern Cape signed Quinton de Kock and Anrich Nortje . De Kock finished as the leading run-scorer in the fourth season of the SA20 while Nortje was second on the wicket-taker's list. Wildcard pick Marco Jansen's 13 wickets made him the SA20's second-most successful bowler.Steyn sums things up nicely: ""SEC lead [sic] by Stubbs and the great coach Adi Birrell do it again 🏆. Stubbs you champion! SA20 you’re incredible! SA fans are special! What a tournament! Can’t wait for season 5!""","Sunrisers Eastern Cape (SEC) beat Pretoria Capitals (PC) by 6 wickets to become SA20 Champions during the final of the Betway SA20 season 4. Former South Africa seamer Dale Steyn made a bold declaration on December 30, 2025, that SEC were one of his finalists.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127524530,imgsize-153246,width-400,resizemode-4/sec-sa20.jpg"

Shivam Dube press conference: On Ishan and Surya’s knock & his role with the ball

Poll Will Abhishek Sharma break Yuvraj Singh's record of 12-ball half-century? Yes, it's possible! No, it’s too tough!

NEW DELHI: Explosive India opener Abhishek Sharma lit up the Barsapara Cricket Stadium on Sunday with a breathtaking display of power-hitting, smashing the second-fastest T20I half-century by an Indian during the third T20I against New Zealand as India cruised to a dominant eight-wicket win.Abhishek reached his fifty in just 14 balls, eclipsing Hardik Pandya’s 16-ball effort to move into elite company. Only Yuvraj Singh’s legendary 12-ball blitz against England in the 2007 T20 World Cup stands ahead of him.Chasing a modest 154, India stormed to 94/2 inside the powerplay, with Abhishek setting the tone in emphatic fashion. The 25-year-old remained unbeaten on a stunning 68 off just 20 deliveries, striking five fours and four sixes as the hosts wrapped up the chase with ease.“That’s what my team wants from me and I just want to execute all the time,” Abhishek said after the match. “Obviously, it’s not easy to do it every time, but I think it’s all about mental as well and the atmosphere you get around your dressing room.”When asked about the possibility of breaking Yuvraj’s iconic record, Abhishek was respectful yet quietly optimistic. “That’s more than impossible for anyone, but still, you never know,” he said.“Any batsman could do it because all the batters have been batting really well in this series and going forward, it’s going to be fun.”Abhishek also explained his fearless approach, including hitting another six off the first ball of the innings. “I wouldn’t say I want to go from the first ball. It’s just the instinct I get. I think about what the bowler could bowl to me and I just want to play on that ball,” he explained.Detailing his innovative footwork, he added, “It’s all about the field placement. If I get room for myself, then I have the whole off-side. I just want to play with the field.”Yuvraj Singh, meanwhile, responded with trademark wit. “Still can’t get a 50 off 12 balls, can you?” the World Cup hero posted on social media. “Well played — keep going strong!”","Abhishek Sharma hits second-fastest T20I half-century by an Indian.

Brief Scores

Pretoria Capitals:

Sunrisers Eastern Cape:

Sunrisers Eastern Cape cemented their status as the undisputed kings of the SA20 after clinching a third championship title, edging out Pretoria Capitals in a thrilling Season 4 final.A glorious, sold-out Newlands crowd was treated to entertainment of the highest quality as Sunrisers captain Tristan Stubbs and Matthew Breetzke shared an unbroken 114-run partnership for the fifth wicket to take their team home by six wickets with four balls to spare.The heroics were required after Dewald Brevis had earlier produced one of the finest innings the grand old ground at the foot of Table Mountain has witnessed.Brevis walked in with the Capitals reduced to 8/2 and launched a counter-attack of the highest quality, striking a sublime 101 off 56 balls, including eight fours and seven sixes, to lift his side to 158/7.For much of the Sunrisers’ chase, it appeared the total would be enough to hand the Capitals their maiden SA20 title, until the arrival of Stubbs.The Sunrisers skipper seized the initiative with 21 runs off Gideon Peters’ 18th over to breathe life into the chase.The Newlands crowd was on edge as 12 runs followed off Lungi Ngidi’s penultimate over before Stubbs delivered the coup de grâce, smashing two consecutive sixes off Bryce Parsons to send the Sunrisers into seventh heaven.“I am really proud and thrilled. It was a hell of a final. For Dewald to play like he did and for us to hold them to 158, and then needing 13 an over for the last four or five overs,” said Sunrisers coach Adrian Birrell.“I’m very proud. Four finals in a row is a fantastic achievement. I’m proud of every player and the whole squad. Some players haven’t featured, but we’ve got a very good bench. To get here again and give ourselves a chance is special.”The four Player of the Match contenders were Matthew Breetzke, Dewald Brevis, Marco Jansen and Tristan Stubbs, with the centurion winning 79.9 percent of the fan vote.“You want to win the trophy, but you want to do it the right way and set an example for the younger generation,” Birrell added.Stubbs was equally delighted with leading his team to a championship title in his first season as captain.“So stoked, I can’t explain it. Don’t know what we did or how we did it. Me and Matty were calm out there, though probably panicking too. We bat so well together and kept looking for an over to get momentum,” Stubbs said.“I came in during the 16th over and we ran with it. Funny things happen under pressure. I’ve really enjoyed this month. We’ve had a great group to work with, planned really well, and have a brilliant Orange Army backing us wherever we go.”The Capitals have now lost two finals to the Sunrisers after their defeat in the inaugural showpiece in 2023, with captain Keshav Maharaj admitting the pain will linger.“It is disappointing, to say the least. Two batters were in and had got set,” Maharaj said. “You feel the hurt of coming so close. The starts we get with both bat and ball are things we have to look at.“The boys will hurt for a bit. I’m not someone who dwells on negatives, but we have to rectify our mistakes if we want to win trophies as a unit.”158 for 7 in 20 overs (Dewald Brevis 101; Marco Jansen 3/10)162 for 4 in 19.2 overs (Matthew Breetzke 68 not out, Tristan Stubbs 63 not out; Keshav Maharaj 1/23)","Sunrisers Eastern Cape crowned champions of the SA20 season 4.

Jessica Pegula delivered a ruthless and emotionally charged performance to knock out defending champion and close friend Madison Keys, cruising into the quarter-finals of the Australian Open with a commanding 6-3, 6-4 victory on Monday.The sixth seed was clinical in an all-American clash on Rod Laver Arena, dominating from the baseline and exposing Keys’ uncharacteristic errors to set up a last-eight showdown against either fourth seed Amanda Anisimova or China’s Wang Xinyu.Pegula, still chasing her maiden Grand Slam title after finishing runner-up at the US Open in 2024, continues her impressive Melbourne consistency. This marks her fourth Australian Open quarter-final appearance, having previously reached the stage three times between 2021 and 2023. However, the 31-year-old has yet to break through to the semi-finals at Melbourne Park.The win came with mixed emotions. Pegula and Keys share a close bond off the court and co-host the podcast The Player’s Box alongside Desirae Krawczyk and Jennifer Brady. But sentiment was set aside as Pegula produced one of her sharpest displays of the tournament.“I’ve been playing really well, seeing the ball and hitting the ball really well this whole tournament,” Pegula said, revealing she has dropped just 17 games across four matches so far. “I wanted to stay true to that and lean on a couple of things I felt she would do.”Keys, who stunned Aryna Sabalenka in last year’s final to claim her maiden Grand Slam, looked tense and out of rhythm. She committed 27 unforced errors, fired six double faults and struggled to find consistency, particularly on serve.Pegula seized control early, racing to a 2-0 lead in the opening set and dictating rallies with depth and precision. Although Keys briefly threatened a comeback, Pegula quickly reasserted her authority, breaking again before calmly closing out the set.Distractions from an Australia Day air show briefly interrupted play in the second set, but Pegula remained unfazed. Three double faults from Keys handed her the initiative once more, and despite late resistance, the defending champion had no way back as Pegula emphatically ended her title defence.","Jessica Pegula beat defending champion Madison Keys 6-3, 6-4.

The Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) on Sunday said it was willing to play the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup 2026 in India but was bound by the decision of the Bangladesh government, which did not grant clearance for the tour.BCB director Abdur Razzak said government approval is mandatory for all overseas tours and not limited to the World Cup. Speaking to RTV, he said the board had consistently expressed its readiness to participate but had no option other than to follow official instructions.""We have always said that we want to play, but this is the government's decision. So we have to follow whatever the government tells us. And the decision that has been given by the government is not just for this time; whenever we have any tour, we have to get clearance from the government beforehand,"" the BCB director said, as cited by the news agency ANI.BCB Media Committee chairman Amzad Hussain later confirmed that Bangladesh has been removed from the tournament and that the board has accepted the ICC’s decision without taking the matter further.He said the BCB had asked the ICC to move Bangladesh’s matches to Sri Lanka and held several rounds of discussions before the final decision.""We requested the ICC to relocate our matches to Sri Lanka. We had several meetings with them.Their representatives arrived, and high-ranking government officials were also present. Following that, a Zoom meeting was held, and the ICC board informed us of their decision not to relocate our matches and that we would have to play in India, per the existing fixtures. However, the government held a cabinet meeting the day after the ICC board meeting. A decision was made there, clearly stating that if there are no changes to the fixtures, our team cannot participate in the tournament in India. This decision was conveyed by the government,"" he said.Amzad Hussain said the ICC later sought a response within 24 hours, after which Bangladesh reiterated its position.""After that, the ICC asked us to respond within 24 hours, and we politely informed them again that it is not possible for us to play according to these fixtures. Subsequently, we have accepted the ICC board's decision. Since the ICC has stated that we cannot play or that they cannot relocate our matches to Sri Lanka, we are not playing in India. Our stance remains the same. We are not pursuing any further arbitration or other avenues in this matter,"" Amzad Hussain added further.Scotland has officially replaced Bangladesh in the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup 2026. The ICC announced the decision on Saturday, January 24, 2026. The tournament will begin on February 7, 2026, and will be co-hosted by India and Sri Lanka.The withdrawal followed the Bangladesh government’s refusal to clear the national team’s travel to India. Amzad Hussain said the government cited security concerns for players, officials and media personnel.""Since we had already spoken with our government, and the government stated that playing the World Cup matches in India is not safe for us--for our players, journalists, or anyone accompanying our players, the entire contingent--we requested that the matches be relocated to Sri Lanka. However, the ICC did not respond to this request. We tried several times, even after multiple meetings, but they did not respond. There is nothing more we can do because this is a government decision. Due to security concerns, they believe that playing in India is not safe for us, and that is why this decision has been taken by the government,"" the BCB Media Committee Chairman said.Tensions had increased earlier after the BCCI asked IPL franchise Kolkata Knight Riders to release Bangladesh pacer Mustafizur Rahman for the 2026 season, citing unspecified ""developments all around"". The BCB viewed the move as a sign that safety assurances could not be guaranteed.The ICC said it held discussions with the BCB for more than three weeks, including meetings held in person and via video conference. It reviewed the concerns raised, commissioned independent security assessments, and shared security and operational plans covering central and state arrangements.According to the ICC, the assessments found no credible or verifiable security threat to the Bangladesh team, its officials or supporters in India. The ICC said changing the schedule was not appropriate and could affect the integrity of the tournament and future events.After its Wednesday meeting, the ICC Business Corporation Board asked the BCB to confirm participation within 24 hours. As no confirmation was received, the ICC followed its governance and qualification process to name a replacement.Scotland is the highest-ranked T20I team that had not originally qualified for the tournament. They are currently ranked 14th, ahead of Namibia, the United Arab Emirates, Nepal, the United States, Canada, Oman and Italy.","Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) says it is willing to play the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup 2026 in India.

NEW DELHI: Aryna Sabalenka produced another milestone moment at the Australian Open on Sunday, and in the process, she broke a Grand Slam record previously held by Novak Djokovic By dominating yet another tiebreak, Sabalenka claimed her 20th consecutive tiebreak win at Grand Slam events, moving past Djokovic’s mark of 19 and becoming the outright leader in the Open Era.The achievement quickly drew a reaction from Djokovic himself, who responded publicly and with humour.While acknowledging Sabalenka’s remarkable consistency under pressure, the Serbian star joked about losing the record, writing on X, “I’m upset right now.”His light-hearted comment highlighted the significance of the moment and showed respect for Sabalenka’s growing place in tennis history.Sabalenka reached the quarterfinals after a straight-sets victory over Canada’s Victoria Mboko after winning 6-1, 7-6 (1) on Sunday.Although Mboko is just 19 years old and seeded No. 17, Sabalenka took control early and set the tone with powerful serving and aggressive shot-making.She hit three aces in the opening set, controlled the rallies, and broke serve quickly. She wrapped up the set in only 31 minutes while looking calm and confident throughout.The second set proved more challenging, as the Belarusian made more unforced errors and Mboko lifted her level.Mboko chased every ball and played with belief, pushing Sabalenka and forcing longer rallies.Sabalenka built a 4-1 lead and later served at 5-4, but she missed three match points, allowing Mboko to gain momentum and force a tiebreak.However, once the match reached the tiebreak, Sabalenka’s dominance returned. She took control from the start, closed it out with ease, and sealed the record-breaking win.Sabalenka’s success in Melbourne has been consistent. She won the Australian Open in 2023 and defended her title in 2024 after finishing runner-up the year before, and she has also captured two US Open titles.","Aryna Sabalenka breaks Novak Djokovic's Grand Slam tiebreak record.

Bangladesh cricket in turmoil: What it means for the T20 World Cup?

Jason Gillespie post

Former Australia cricketer Jason Gillespie emerged as one of the most vocal critic of the ICC after Bangladesh were removed from the 2026 Men’s T20 World Cup, questioning what he described as a glaring lack of consistency in how the world body applies its own standards.Gillespie, who has previously worked as head coach of Pakistan , took to X to draw a direct comparison with the 2025 Champions Trophy, when India were allowed to play their matches at a neutral venue after citing security concerns about travelling to Pakistan.“Has there been an explanation from the ICC why Bangladesh could not play their games outside of India?” Gillespie wrote. “From memory, India refused to play Champions Trophy matches in Pakistan and were allowed to play those games outside the country. Can someone make this make sense?”The former fast bowler later deleted the post.Bangladesh were officially replaced by Scotland after a three-week impasse with the ICC. The Bangladesh Cricket Board had refused to send its team to India for the World Cup, repeatedly flagging security concerns and pushing for their matches to be shifted to Sri Lanka. The ICC, however, stood firm, citing multiple independent security assessments which concluded there was “no credible or verifiable security threat” to the Bangladesh team in India.The standoff intensified after a January 21 ICC board meeting, where all but two members rejected Bangladesh’s request to relocate matches and issued the BCB a 24-hour ultimatum to reconsider. Bangladesh did not back down, instead challenging the ICC’s assessment and claiming the threat level was higher than reported. That position was viewed internally as difficult to justify, especially given Bangladesh’s tour of Pakistan for the Champions Trophy the previous year under a higher threat perception.In its official statement, the ICC described Bangladesh’s removal as a “difficult decision”, stressing that it was not feasible to amend the schedule so close to the tournament. “Over a period of more than three weeks, the ICC engaged with the BCB through multiple rounds of dialogue,” the statement said, adding that detailed security and operational plans had been shared at several stages.","Former Australia cricketer Jason Gillespie emerged as one of the most vocal critic of the ICC.

NEW DELHI: Indian cricket stalwarts former men's team skipper Rohit Sharma and current women's ODI World Cup-winning captain Harmanpreet Kaur Bhullar will be conferred with the Padma Shri in the field of Sports, a recognition of their immense contribution to Indian cricket across formats and generations.Rohit Sharma’s honour comes on the back of a remarkable leadership phase with the Indian men’s cricket team. He guided India to two ICC titles, lifting the Men’s T20 World Cup in 2024 and the Champions Trophy in 2025. Shortly after winning the T20 World Cup, Rohit retired from the shortest format, bringing down the curtain on a glittering T20I career. He later stepped away from Test cricket in 2025 and now features exclusively in ODIs.Across international cricket, Rohit has amassed 20,109 runs, scoring 50 centuries and 111 half-centuries, numbers that underline his longevity and impact at the highest level. From a free-flowing opener to a World Cup-winning captain, Rohit’s journey has been defined by evolution and consistency.Harmanpreet Kaur’s Padma Shri recognition follows one of the most iconic moments in Indian women’s cricket history.She became the first Indian captain to lift an ICC Women’s World Cup after India defeated South Africa by 52 runs in the final at the DY Patil Stadium in Navi Mumbai.Defending a target of 299, India produced a dominant bowling performance. Deepti Sharma starred with a five-wicket haul, while Shafali Verma’s all-round contribution played a key role as South Africa were bowled out for 246 in 45.3 overs. The victory sealed India’s maiden Women’s World Cup title on home soil.With this triumph, Harmanpreet also became only the second Indian captain to win a World Cup at home. MS Dhoni was the first to achieve the feat when he led the men’s team to the 2011 World Cup title at the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai.The Padma Shri honour for Rohit Sharma and Harmanpreet Kaur stands as recognition of leadership, legacy, and moments that reshaped Indian cricket history.",Former men's team skipper Rohit Sharma and current women's ODI World Cup-winning captain Harmanpreet Kaur Bhullar will be conferred with the Padma Shri in the field of Sports.

Pakistan Cricket Board chairman Mohsin Naqvi on Sunday said that the announcement of the T20 World Cup squad does not mean Pakistan has decided to take part in next month’s ICC event.Naqvi repeated that the PCB is still waiting for a green light from the Pakistan government before taking a final call on participation in the T20 World Cup, which will be held in India and Sri Lanka.The International Cricket Council (ICC) on Saturday removed Bangladesh from the tournament and named Scotland as their replacement after the Bangladesh Cricket Board refused to send its team to India, citing security concerns following Mustafizur Rahman’s exit from the IPL.""We are waiting for the government's advice and whatever the government tells us to do we will do it.

Shivam Dube press conference: On Ishan and Surya’s knock & his role with the ball

MS Dhoni may have stepped away from international cricket five years ago, but the questions around his future refuse to fade. The Chennai Super Kings icon, now 44, is preparing for what will be the 19th season of the Indian Premier League, having already begun training in Ranchi nearly two months before the expected start of IPL 2026.Dhoni has featured in six IPL seasons since his last appearance for India in 2019, and with CSK bringing in several big names, including India wicketkeeper Sanju Samson , speculation has grown that the veteran could transition into a non-playing role. Former teammate R Ashwin , however, does not see that happening.Ashwin, who retired from IPL cricket in August 2025 after his final season with CSK, believes Dhoni could even take on a radically different batting role this year. Speaking on his YouTube channel, the off-spinner suggested that Dhoni may look to impact games early rather than finishing them late.“Dhoni looks set to play as he has already started practising. He’s looking fit. Some said he may not play in the 11, or this might be his last season. But it looks like he got motivated seeing Imran Tahir. Looking at him, it doesn’t look like he’ll bat at No.9. He looks like he’ll come out to bat at No.3 in the Powerplay and be the enforcer, the way he has begun practice,” Ashwin said.CSK endured a difficult campaign last season, finishing bottom of the table, while Dhoni himself managed 196 runs at a strike rate of 135.17 across 14 matches. Despite that, Ashwin feels the franchise has put together a formidable squad ahead of the new season.“They’ve scouted very well and boast a powerhouse of a batting lineup. Ruturaj Gaikwad, Sanju Samson, Ayush Mhatre, Dewald Brevis, Shivam Dube, Karthik Sharma, and Prashant Veer is a batting lineup, barring the inexperience in the last two, you ask how are teams going to stop this batting lineup? Even a 200 to 200 becomes really difficult for teams to stop CSK to,” Ashwin added.He also highlighted the depth and versatility within the squad, pointing to overseas reinforcements and young Indian talent as key strengths.“Even Jamie Overton is going great guns. Only the combination CSK decides to go with is to be seen. Ayush Mhatre, irrespective of what happens in the U-19 World Cup, will deliver in the IPL. CSK’s batting is a tough one to stop. If they get the combination and momentum right, that is a batting lineup that’s really going to make work very difficult for bowlers around the tournament.”With Dhoni already back in training and Ashwin hinting at an aggressive new role, the CSK captain’s future once again promises intrigue as another IPL season approaches.",MS Dhoni is preparing for what will be the 19th season of the Indian Premier League.

Bangladesh cricket in turmoil: What it means for the T20 World Cup?

Ex-India off-spinner Harbhajan Singh has weighed in on the controversy surrounding Bangladesh’s exclusion from the 2026 T20 World Cup and Pakistan ’s public backing of the country. The Pakistan Cricket Board had earlier suggested that its own participation in the tournament would be guided by government advice, a statement that some interpreted as a hint Pakistan might pull out in solidarity with Bangladesh.Harbhajan was critical of Pakistan’s stance, calling it an unnecessary attempt to frame the situation as a “2 vs 1” battle. He questioned both the intent and timing of the PCB’s move, noting that Pakistan already had matches scheduled in Sri Lanka and that their intervention was not needed. According to him, it is Bangladesh and its players who are bearing the real cost of the dispute.“Pakistan was fishing in muddy waters and trying the game of 2 vs 1. (Pakistan and Bangladesh against India),” Harbhajan told PTI.“They already are playing in Sri Lanka, this wasn't their matter. Why interfere where you are needed? In the end, it is Bangladesh cricket team and its players who are losing. The players missing out on a World Cup participation is massive.”The ICC confirmed on Saturday that Scotland will replace Bangladesh in the tournament, calling it a “difficult decision.”Officials explained that there was no feasible way to accommodate the Bangladesh Cricket Board’s request to shift their matches to Sri Lanka with the World Cup just around the corner.Harbhajan also criticised the BCB, suggesting that the board let ego guide its decisions rather than seeking a resolution.“BCB should have kept channels open for discussion with ICC,” he said. “They should have kept the channels open for discussion with the ICC before straightaway saying 'no' to coming to India.”He added that PCB chief Mohsin Naqvi had no right to issue a pull-out threat on Saturday, calling it unnecessary.From a cricketing perspective, Harbhajan pointed out that Bangladesh could have performed well on Indian pitches, particularly with the quality of spinners in their squad.“Had the T20 World Cup been played in England or Australia, they didn't even stand a chance, but here they could have actually made it to the second round and maybe cause a few upsets in the Super Eights. So it's no one's loss but Bangladesh's,” he said.","Harbhajan Singh criticises Pakistan's stance on T20 World Cup. Ex-India spinner says it is Bangladesh and its players who are bearing the cost.

Shivam Dube press conference: On Ishan and Surya’s knock & his role with the ball

India’s T20I batting depth and intent touched a new high in Guwahati on Sunday as the men in blue registered their fastest-ever team fifty in the format, racing to 50 in just 3.1 overs against New Zealand. The record-breaking start now sits at the top of India’s quickest team fifties list, ahead of several other explosive efforts over the past five years.The landmark came during a ruthless chase in the third T20I, where India hunted down 154 in only 10 overs to seal an eight-wicket win and take an unassailable 3-0 lead in the five-match series. At the heart of it was Abhishek Sharma, whose fearless approach summed up India’s new-age T20 mindset.Abhishek smashed a breathtaking 14-ball fifty, the second-fastest by an Indian in T20Is, and finished unbeaten on 68 off just 20 balls. His assault, combined with Suryakumar Yadav ’s fluent 57 not out off 26 deliveries, turned the contest into a one-sided spectacle. Together, they added an unbroken 102 runs for the third wicket in only 40 balls, leaving New Zealand shell-shocked.India’s lightning fifty in 3.1 overs pushed previous benchmarks down the list.The next quickest came in 3.4 overs against Bangladesh in Hangzhou in 2023, followed by a cluster of fifties reached in 3.5 overs against teams like Scotland, Australia, Nepal, Zimbabwe and England across different venues. None, however, matched the ferocity of the Guwahati start.The chase did begin with a brief stumble as Sanju Samson was dismissed for a golden duck, continuing his tough run at the top. But any nerves were quickly settled by Abhishek and Ishan Kishan . Ishan, fresh from a match-winning knock in Raipur, tore into Matt Henry , while Abhishek danced down the track to dismantle Jacob Duffy. India thundered to 94 for 2 in the powerplay, their second-best ever, effectively ending the contest inside six overs.Earlier, India’s bowlers laid the foundation with a disciplined display. Jasprit Bumrah led the charge with three for 17, while Hardik Pandya and Ravi Bishnoi applied constant pressure to restrict New Zealand to 153 for 9. Bishnoi, returning to the XI, impressed with his control and timely breakthroughs.In the end, the night belonged to India’s batting firepower.

NEW DELHI: India produced a ruthless all-round performance to crush New Zealand by eight wickets in the third T20I at Guwahati on Sunday and pocket the five-match series with a 3-0 score.After winning the toss, India opted to field, and their bowlers justified the decision with a disciplined and aggressive display.Jasprit Bumrah led the attack superbly, finishing with figures of 3 for 17 and setting the tone from the outset.Harshit Rana struck early to remove Devon Conway, while Hardik Pandya kept things tight and picked up two key wickets, including Rachin Ravindra and Daryl Mitchell.Spinner Ravi Bishnoi was outstanding in the middle overs, claiming 2 for 18 and breaking a crucial partnership by dismissing Glenn Phillips and Mark Chapman.Phillips was New Zealand’s top-scorer with 48, while Chapman contributed 32 and captain Mitchell Santner added a late 27.However, the visitors struggled to build sustained momentum as wickets fell regularly. Despite Santner’s late hitting, New Zealand were restricted to a modest 153 for 9 in their 20 overs.In reply, India made light work of the chase. The hosts suffered an early setback when Sanju Samson was bowled first ball, but that only sparked a fierce counterattack.Ishan Kishan played a brisk knock before falling, setting the platform for Abhishek Sharma and captain Suryakumar Yadav to take charge.Abhishek was sensational, blasting 68 not out off just 20 balls, while Suryakumar produced a trademark innings of 57 not out from 26 deliveries.The duo punished anything loose, found the boundaries at will, and kept the scoreboard racing.

I'm really happy to have in this state of form and above all, because of the great work they are doing.""They are really committed to the team, they are the first who are pressing... they're giving this effort and solidarity that we need from them, so I'm very happy that their reward comes in the form of goals.""It was a lively but imprecise start at Villarreal's Estadio de la Ceramica, as the game glowed but neither side was able to seriously threaten.Georges Mikautadze lashed a volley narrowly wide after veteran forward Gerard Moreno found him with a floating cross.At the other end, Madrid midfielder Arda Guler fired straight at Villarreal stopper Luiz Junior after some tidy footwork, and then shot high over the bar at the end of a swift break.Villarreal's Juan Foyth limped off hurt in a blow for the hosts, who created a good chance for Pape Gueye just before the break.The Senegal midfielder, a champion at the Africa Cup of Nations last weekend, powered narrowly wide of the post.Vinicius, who excelled in Madrid's 6-1 Champions League rout of Monaco in midweek, also came close with a rasping effort that sailed across Luiz Junior's goal and wide.The 25-year-old Brazil forward went a 13th straight La Liga match without scoring, but was involved as Mbappe found the net two minutes into the second half.- 'Nightmare for defences' -Vinicius came into the box from the left flank and his low cross was blocked but Mbappe was on hand to squeeze home his 20th league goal of the campaign from close range.""They are a nightmare for defences,"" said Madrid goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois. ""I hope they can keep bringing joy.""Villarreal had the better of the second half as they worked hard to pull level, but Moreno spurned their best chance by firing inches over when well-placed.In stoppage time, Mbappe was felled clumsily by Alfonso Pedraza in the box and the French forward cheekily dinked home the resulting penalty to seal Madrid's victory.Mbappe's team-mate Brahim Diaz, who missed a similar attempted Panenka penalty for Morocco in the Africa Cup of Nations final, was on the pitch to see it as he returned to action for his club.""For you,"" Mbappe appeared to say to Diaz during the celebration, indicating it was a gesture of support.""For me, the most important thing is that (the players) are united, we saw it last Wednesday with Vinicius's goal (against Monaco) and we saw it again today, with Brahim,"" Arbeloa told reporters.The Yellow Submarine are now 10 points behind leaders Madrid, having played one fewer match than Arbeloa's side.""We have to be a bit more accurate in attack against these kinds of teams,"" admitted Villarreal midfielder Alberto Moleiro.Elsewhere, fifth-placed Espanyol fell to a 3-2 defeat at Valencia that left them seven points behind Villarreal.",Kylian Mbappe scores twice as Real Madrid beat Villarreal 2-0 in La Liga. Alvaro Arbeloa's side move two points clear of Barcelona at the top of the table.

Having made a blockbuster €140 million move from Bayer Leverkusen to Anfield, Florian Wirtz has had a tricky start to life at Anfield and in the Premier League . Widely regarded as one of Europe’s most gifted creative attackers, the 22-year-old Germany international arrived at Liverpool on the back of a standout spell in Bundesliga, where his freedom, intelligence and ability to control games marked him out as a generational talent.In the 29 games he's played at Liverpool across competitions, he's scored four goals and provided seven assists.Before the eventual move to the Merseyside, there was interest also from Bayern Munich. But Wirtz’s decision to embrace the Premier League underlines both his ambition and belief in Liverpool’s long-term vision.In this wide-ranging exclusive conversation with TimesofIndia.com, facilitated by JioStar, Wirtz reflects on the pull of Liverpool’s history, the challenge of meeting sky-high expectations, and the clarity provided by the manager’s plans for the team.Liverpool's immense stature as a club first and foremost. The team that clinched the Premier League last year. Above all, the manager's vision convinced me.Tactics aren't much different from the Bundesliga or Germany duty.In-game, it's the physicality I need to adapt to most.They've had many great midfielders. I just focus on giving my best on the pitch. I don't know what sets me apart—whether I do better or they did. I simply want to play my game and achieve success with the club.Probably the first Newcastle game. It was wildly intense — the early red card, endless long balls, two-footed tackles, everything. The crowd went berserk. That moment made me think, 'This league is different from the Bundesliga.’I don't measure success in specific terms. I focus on delivering my best performance wherever I am — at Liverpool or with the national team—to be vital for the squad and drive achievements.

Trump Booed Loudly As Miami Stadium Erupts During College Football Playoff

AI to help with planning itineraries

BENGALURU: For those who are preparing to pack their bags to watch the likes of Lionel Messi, Kylian Mbappe, and Lamine Yamal in any of the 11 American cities that will host the World Cup 2026 matches, the Americans are determined to make it football’s best ever showpiece event. Awaiting the fans are fast-tracked visas and curated experiences, including road trips to explore the heart of the US, Route 66 being the most famous of them.The US joins Mexico and Canada to host the FIFA World Cup, the games in the US will begin with the hosts taking on Paraguay in a Group D match in Los Angeles on June 12, day after the tournament kicks off in Mexico City. That will set football (soccer for Americans) rolling across 11 cities for the next one month. The Americans, who put American football, baseball and basketball, above the world’s most popular sport are keen to make it the biggest ever spectacle for the millions of fans offering them an unbelievable time.“From New York to Miami to LA and Seattle, it’s quite a diverse list of host cities. I think each of the host cities are excited to put on a great show, and really engage their communities because it is very much about the communities that are hosting as well.The fan fests are going to be a great way to go beyond the stadium into the community. Local food, culture, music, and engaging with local communities as well. It’s hard to describe how exciting it’s going to be. I think it's going to be beyond any of our expectations,” Fred Dixon, president and CEO of Brand USA, told TOI in an exclusive interview.Speaking on the sidelines of the Brand USA Travel Week India held here, Dixon said the authorities also plan to make it easy for the spectators to get the US visa. “If you decide to buy tickets to the World Cup and you don’t have your visa yet, there actually is a way to facilitate that process to identify yourself as a ticket holder, and then the State Department will work to facilitate the visa processing faster for those travelers,” Dixon said.Dixon was particularly excited to welcome the Indians travelling for the World Cup. “In places like New Jersey and New York, places like Atlanta and Dallas, Texas, those are obviously big communities. The communities will come to life through the fan fests and so there will be the official fan fest events for every host city. So you'll be in the communities with the locals or with your friends and the people you're traveling with. With more than 5 million Indians living in the US, seeking out and traveling with or spending time with family and friends will be a big component of that,” Dixon said.On whether there will be any relaxation for the fans from Haiti and Iran, Dixon didn’t have an answer. “You’d have to check with the State Department,” he said.For those millions who get entry into the US and the special ones who get lucky through the draw, FIFA said there were 500 million requests for tickets to watch the matches, the US wanted to wow them. On top of the list are the road trips including the iconic Route 66.“It’s a unique moment as well because it’s the 250th anniversary of America. So you have America, 250 activities happening all across the country as well. The other anniversary that’s happening this year is Route 66. It's the 100th anniversary of the famous highway (opened on Nov 11, 1926) that connects California and Chicago -- from Chicago to Santa Monica. It winds through small, interesting towns all across the west of the US. And so you’re going to see a lot of themes around road trips, that freedom of the open road in America. So I think there will be a lot of curated experiences around road trips,” said Dixon.“In the host cities themselves, you’re going to have lots of curated experiences, whether it relates to museums, art, exhibitions. The travelers are going to benefit from the focus on a lot of Americana, both historical, but also what American brands, I think, have meant to the world. The Fleet Week, which is one of the big celebrations in New York every year in the harbour, has been moved from what is normally in late May. It’s now moving to July 4th. So just imagine the Statue of Liberty with fireworks and all the Navy fleets, you know. It’s expected to have the largest gathering of tall ships in the world for America 250, which will travel up the east coast of the US. So there is an unlimited amount of curated experiences to have,” Dixon added.“At americathebeautiful.com , we actually have AI integration to help with trip inspiration, particularly when you are dealing with an event that is multi-city, multi-date. We know what the group schedule will be, but as teams advance beyond the group, who’s going to the quarterfinals, who’s going to the semifinals, how would you route yourself? The itineraries may be dynamic if you’re following a particular team. And so our new website has an AI component built into it to help with itinerary suggestions and plannings and ideas.“You also can integrate what your passion points are. So if it’s culture, if it’s history and food, it will help give you highlights and ideas for how you can route yourself. It’s not a booking platform, but it's an inspiration platform. We’ve used AI in a way to help tap into really what is the best of America, and then to inspire travelers to travel, you know, far and to travel deep when they're in the US to explore the World cup, specifically,” Dixon signed off.","The US joins Mexico and Canada to host the FIFA World Cup.

Jay Shah’s 2036 Olympic blueprint for India: '8 Medals won’t cut it'

NEW DELHI/KOLKATA: Former India and East Bengal defender Ilyas Pasha died on Thursday after a prolonged illness.He was 61. He is survived by his wife, two daughters, and two sons.The All India Football Federation (AIFF) condoled the death of Pasha, who was one of the best footballers to have come out of Karnataka.A committed and soft-spoken footballer, Pasha carved out a distinguished career in an area of the field that demanded resilience and composure - defence.Primarily operating as a right wing-back, he was renowned for his impeccable sense of timing, calm demeanour, and ability to read the game astutely.Rarely flustered under pressure, Pasha's disciplined positioning and well-judged tackles ensured that opposing left wingers found little joy on his flank, while goalkeepers behind him operated with added confidence.At the international level, Pasha made his senior India debut on January 27, 1987, against Bulgaria in the Nehru Cup at Kozhikode.He went on to earn eight international caps, featuring in two editions of the Nehru Cup (1987 and 1991), the 1991 SAF Games, and the 1992 Asian Cup qualifiers.Pasha began his football journey with Vinayaka Football Club, Vyalikaval, in north Bengaluru, where he also resided.His consistent performances soon earned him a move to Indian Telephone Industries in the mid-1980s, a period that marked his emergence at the national level.From 1987 onwards, he became a regular feature for Karnataka in the Santosh Trophy , representing the state at the tournaments held in Kolkata in 1987, Quilon (now Kollam) in 1988, and Guwahati in 1989.His performance in Guwahati stood out, as Karnataka narrowly missed out on a final berth. He also won two Santosh Trophy titles with Bengal in 1993 and 1995.On the back of his domestic exploits, Pasha was signed by Mohammedan Sporting, where he continued to enhance his reputation, winning the Sait Nagjee Trophy and the Nizam Gold Cup in 1989.He later joined East Bengal, a move that ushered in the most defining phase of his club career. Representing the iconic red and gold from the early 1990s through the end of the decade, Pasha became an integral part of one of the club's most successful eras.He captained East Bengal during the 1993-94 season and was a trusted figure under the late coach Subhas Bhowmick.With the Red and Gold Brigade, he won the Calcutta Football League on five occasions (1991, 1993, 1995, 1996 and 1998), the IFA Shield five times (1990, 1991, 1994, 1995 and 1997), and the Durand Cup four times (1990, 1991, 1993 and 1995).His trophy cabinet also included two Rovers Cups (1990, 1994), the Federation Cup (1996), the historic Wai Wai Cup in Kathmandu (1993), Airlines Trophy titles in 1990, 1992, 1995 and 1997, the Bordoloi Trophy (1992), ATPA Shield (1992), Kalinga Cup (1993), McDowell Trophy (1995, 1997), and the Super Cup in the 1996-97 season.He was also a member of East Bengal's celebrated triple crown-winning side in 1990 and captained the team to its first international title at the Wai Wai Cup in 1993.He also wore the captain's armband when East Bengal registered a sensational 6-2 victory over Iraq's Al Zawraa SC in the 1993-94 Asian Cup Winners' Cup.He got a special Lifetime Achievement Award from East Bengal in 2012.The AIFF said it has joined the Indian football fraternity in mourning the loss of Pasha, a defender of rare composure and consistency, to honour his lasting contributions to the game.In Kolkata, the East Bengal flag was kept at half-mast on the day, while the club's Under-16 team observed a minute's silence before training.Former East Bengal skipper Falguni Dutta, who played alongside Pasha for two years, remembered him fondly. ""I came to know early in the morning. I was shocked.""When I came to the club in 1997, I was a raw talent and he was there to guide me as a mentor. He played in the same position as me, but I never saw any jealousy in him. He was like an elder brother -- a guide and a coach. He inspired us,"" Dutta said.East Bengal Club bid a final farewell to Pasha at his Bengaluru residence.Working committee member Dipten Bose paid his respects, while former players Saravanan, Thomas and Feroz were also present.","Former India and East Bengal defender Ilyas Pasha dies at 61. Pasha was renowned for his impeccable sense of timing, calm demeanour, and ability to read the game astutely. The All India Football Federation (AIFF) condoled the death of Pasha.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127144379,imgsize-58888,width-400,resizemode-4/mj-61.jpg"
From Rs 275 crore to bare bones: AIFF faces a tough test to sell ISL broadcast rights,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/news/from-rs-275-crore-to-bare-bones-aiff-faces-a-tough-test-to-sell-isl-broadcast-rights/articleshow/127128213.cms,"With no takers for its first tender, the AIFF is scrambling to find a broadcaster for ISL 2025–26.

Time for recalibration

What does the current RFP say?

Poll What is your opinion on the AIFF's decision to issue a second Request for Proposal for ISL broadcast rights? It's a necessary step for improvement It shows a lack of planning It's too late to make a difference I have no opinion on this

Last week, the All India Football Federation (AIFF) floated a Request for Proposal (RFP) tender looking for a broadcast partner for the 2025-26 Indian Super League (ISL) season. This was the second time in six months that the AIFF had issued such a document as the first version, released in October 2025, demanded an annual minimum guarantee of Rs 37.5 crore. For a variety of reasons, that didn't find any takers.Ever since, Indian football is in a free fall.AIFF's deal with Football Sports Development Limited (FSDL), which had started the ISL in 2014, expired on December 8, 2025. Between AIFF Constitutional changes, court visits, lack of commercial partners and eventual intervention by the Sports Ministry, ISL has taken a massive hit to its credibility, even if it now has a start date in February 14.The fixtures for ISL 2025-26, which have been tucked away in the draft folder for days due to home venues being in shambles, add to the challenge for any prospective broadcast bidder(s).With 91 matches to be played in the upcoming truncated season in a single leg home-and-away format, this race against time only gets trickier with each passing day. The fact that AIFF have not officially appointed an agency to oversee the broadcast bids process doesn't bode well either.In 2021, the BCCI brought in audit, tax and financial advisory consultants KPMG to advise them on the media rights sale for the IPL. The objective was clear: earn 'top dollar.' It resulted in media rights for the IPL going at Rs 48,390.32 crore over five years - a 100 percent jump in value per match.AIFF, which has hardly showcased its competence in the past few months, is alone in this regard. Before FSDL stepped away, the ISL had a broadcast deal worth Rs 550 crore over two seasons with games showcased on linear TV and OTT. At first, ISL matches were broadcast on the Star Sports Network before moving to the Viacom18-owned Sports18/JioCinema.The Rs 275 crore-a-year deal was reportedly a 37.5 percent increase on what Star India, who had a majority stake in the ISL, had been paying in the first 10 years of the competition.This Rs 275 crore funded things such as match production, league marketing, revenue for the clubs and fixed payments to the federation. Despite this, FSDL posted losses of Rs 14.34 crore in FY23, Rs 46.3 crore in FY22, Rs 13.7 crore in FY21 and Rs 27 crore in FY20. The league only turned profitable when operations were scaled down, posting a net profit of Rs 45.2 crore in FY24.Now, in this post-FSDL era, AIFF and, by extension, the ISL clubs have little room to negotiate with any potential bidders. With the ISL set to be played in multiple cities, it adds to the costs involved with only Rs 9.77 crore budgeted for Production and Transmission. In the past, it hovered around Rs 70 crores.It means the quality output of the broadcast will be lower. Instead of multi-camera setups in different parts of the ground, one can expect 3-4 cameras, similar to the I-League coverage where equipment is placed at a high vantage point, behind the goal and near the half-way line.An ISL club official, who spoke to TimesofIndia.com on the condition of anonymity, said that organising the league in multiple cities could dissuade potential bidders. He also reminded that options are limited anyway, as February-March is also the period for the T20 World Cup in India and Sri Lanka, which JioStar will broadcast.The logic is simple: higher viewership means higher sponsorship for clubs and with an inferior product, that Rs 5-6 crore piece of the puzzle is going to take a hit. All clubs are braced for another year of red in their balance sheet. Even though many will cut costs operationally and have reduced player wages, the losses are expected to be three times the normal in the absence of commercial revenue.Like other aspects of the ISL including franchise fees and player salaries, the broadcast rights value also needs to be recalibrated for a healthier future. While this upcoming season can largely be logged as a stop-gap solution-finding exercise, the exercise towards an economically viable product needs to begin now. As ICC and BCCI have found out, mindless pricing of broadcast deals will drive away smaller players in the streaming space. And unlike sports like cricket and kabaddi - whose audience still consumes coverage on linear TV - football's young viewership exists on OTT.Subsequently, if players stay away due to pricing, it will further dwindle AIFF's options. Among the major broadcast players - on linear TV and digital - there are few options outside of JioStar and Sony Sports Network.AIFF's RFP for media rights of the ISL is a 39-page document that lays down the detailed eligibility framework for prospective bidders and specifies the timelines for bids to be submitted, examined and assessed.As per the schedule, the AIFF has fixed January 23 for a pre-bid meeting with interested parties, while any written queries or requests for clarification may be addressed by up to January 27.Bids must be submitted no later than 5:00 pm IST on February 1, with each submission accompanied by a security deposit of Rs. 5 lakh.Eligibility conditions require bidders to be broadcasters or internet operators with a minimum of three years’ operational experience.In addition, bidders must have recorded a net worth of at least Rs. 10 crore in the most recent financial year (2024–25) and an average annual revenue of no less than Rs. 10 crore across the last three completed financial years — 2022–23, 2023–24 and 2024–25.In the case of consortium bids, a maximum of three entities may come together under a special purpose vehicle (SPV). One member must be designated as the ‘Lead member’ and hold at least a 51 percent equity stake in the SPV’s paid-up and subscribed share capital.Each bid will be evaluated in two components — Technical and Financial — carrying weightages of 70 percent and 30 percent respectively. The bidder securing the highest overall score will be awarded the rights for the forthcoming season.","The All India Football Federation (AIFF) floated a Request for Proposal (RFP) tender looking for a broadcast partner for the 2025-26 Indian Super League (ISL) season.

France’s sports minister on Tuesday said the country's government is not considering, as of now, a boycott of the 2026 football World Cup in the United States, despite rising political tensions linked to US President Donald Trump’s remarks on Greenland.""At the moment we are speaking, there is no desire from the ministry to boycott this major, much-anticipated competition,"" sports minister Marina Ferrari told reporters, as cited by news agency Associated Press""That said, I am not prejudging what might happen.""Ferrari said she wants sport to remain separate from politics.""The 2026 World Cup is an extremely important moment for all sports lovers,"" she said.The men’s World Cup is scheduled to begin in June and will be jointly hosted by the United States, Canada and Mexico.

Stefon Diggs lets emotion pour out after AFC title win

On January 25, 2026, the New England Patriots secured their place in Super Bowl LX. The final score mattered. But above all, the emotion did. For Stefon Diggs , the moment unfolded slowly, then all at once.As the clock expired in Denver, Diggs stood near midfield trying to process it. This was not just another playoff win. Instead, it marked the end of a long comeback. By the time he reached the interview area, the weight of the season finally showed.The Patriots defeated the Denver Broncos 10-7 in the AFC Championship Game at Empower Field at Mile High on Sunday night. The game stayed tight from start to finish. Both defenses controlled the pace. As a result, every possession carried pressure.Steffon Diggs finished with five receptions for 17 yards. The numbers did not stand out. Still, his presence shaped the game. Denver shaded coverage toward him all night, which opened space elsewhere in the offense.Moments later, Diggs spoke during a live on-field postgame television interview on January 25. Almost immediately, his voice cracked.“I’m just so proud of this team, man,” Diggs said during the AFC Championship postgame interview.“You don’t know how hard this year has been, battling the injury and coming back. Being around the right group of guys. Great quarterback, great OC, great team, great head coach. It made it all worth it.”Then, Diggs addressed the criticism that followed him throughout the season.“They were calling me washed,” he said in the same interview. “Saying I didn’t have it no more. I just wanted to prove to myself I am who I say I am. Eliot Wolf took a chance on me. This team took a chance on me. I just wanted to make them proud.”That doubt traced back to 2024. Diggs suffered a torn ACL while playing for the Houston Texans, ending his season early. Because of that injury, questions followed him into free agency. However, the Patriots believed the risk was worth it.Earlier in the 2025 season, off-field issues brought more scrutiny. Nevertheless, Diggs stayed available and productive. He played all 17 regular-season games and led New England with 85 receptions and 1,013 receiving yards.Previously, Diggs had lost two conference championship games with the Bills and Vikings. This time, the outcome changed. As a result, the Patriots now head to Super Bowl LX. More importantly, Diggs arrives there with proof that the doubts did not define him.","New England Patriots defeated the Denver Broncos 10-7 in the AFC Championship Game.

Kennedy Stidham responds as backlash grows around Jarrett Stidham

The snow in Denver did not just slow the game; it stopped it. It slowed the Broncos’ season to a stop. On January 25, 2026, the New England Patriots beat Denver 10–7 at Empower Field at Mile High to win the AFC Championship and book a spot in Super Bowl 60. By the final whistle, frustration hung heavier than the snowfall.Jarrett Stidham walked into the postseason spotlight under extreme circumstances. He replaced an injured Bo Nix and faced the league’s top-seeded defense in brutal weather. By Sunday night, fans questioned his decisions. By Monday, criticism followed him everywhere. That was when his wife decided to speak.In her latest post, Kennedy Stidham sent a message after the Broncos’ season-ending loss. Her words came as scrutiny around her husband intensified across television, social media, and talk radio.“We love this team, we love this city,” Kennedy Stidham wrote on X on Monday morning. “Thank you all for the kindest support all week. This city is so special, this team is so special. We wanted this so badly for everyone.”She later reshared Denver’s official postgame message on Instagram and added a short note thanking God.The timing mattered. Jarrett Stidham faced growing criticism for turnovers and missed opportunities in a game decided by three points.Stidham started strong. On January 25, he connected with Marvin Mims Jr. for a 52-yard gain on Denver’s second drive. Two plays later, he hit Courtland Sutton for a six-yard touchdown. The Broncos led 7–0 and controlled early momentum.The game turned late in the second quarter. Under pressure on third down, Stidham attempted to throw the ball away. The pass went backwards. New England recovered the fumble inside Denver territory. Patriots quarterback Drake Maye scored on a six-yard run two plays later to tie the game.Criticism sharpened after halftime. Snow worsened. Denver’s offense stalled. Fans questioned Sean Payton’s decision to skip a short field goal while leading 7–0 and go for it on fourth-and-1. The drive failed. Stidham later threw an interception to Christian Gonzalez with under three minutes left, ending Denver’s final possession.He finished 17 of 31 for 133 yards, one touchdown, one fumble, and one interception. Analysts pointed to ball security. Fans debated the experience. CBS viewers also criticized Tony Romo’s commentary, accusing him of being overly protective of Stidham during the broadcast.New England advanced by leaning on defense and discipline. The Patriots allowed no points after the first quarter and held Denver scoreless in the second half.For Jarrett Stidham, the loss brought harsh judgment. For Kennedy Stidham, it brought perspective. Her message did not answer critics. It reminded them that behind every playoff loss stands a family feeling it too.","Kennedy Stidham responds as backlash grows around her husband.

Veronika McVay makes rare public appearance to support husband



Sean McVay, the Los Angeles Rams head coach, marked his 40th birthday yesterday with one eye on history. Already the youngest coach ever hired in NFL history at just 30, McVay now stands on the brink of becoming the youngest coach to lead a team to three Super Bowls. The milestone couldn’t come at a more dramatic moment, as his Rams faced off against NFC West rival Seattle Seahawks in a high-stakes NFC Championship clash.The NFC Championship game carried more than just playoff significance- it was personal. McVay’s opponent, Seattle’s new head coach Mike McDonald, is 38 years old, making for a rare showdown between two of the NFL’s youngest coaching stars. Winning on the road, in front of the Seahawks’ famously loud 12th man, would be the perfect birthday gift for McVay and a chance to assert his leadership on a grand stage.At his side for the big game was wife Veronika McVay, who has largely stayed out of the public eye. The FOX Sports broadcast captured a tender moment as the couple shared a kiss following McVay’s warm embrace with their two-year-old son Jordan. This was Veronika’s first public outing since giving birth to their second son, Christian, in mid-December. The Rams playfully announced the arrival of Christian as part of their “latest transaction moves.Veronika, originally from Ukraine, met McVay while she was studying at George Mason University. He was then a rising offensive coaching star with the Washington Commanders. Their relationship blossomed over the years, culminating in a proposal in Cannes, France, on June 22, 2019, and a wedding at the Beverly Hills Hotel on June 4, 2022. Today, Veronika balances her role as a mother with a career in luxury real estate, accompanying McVay to Los Angeles as he transformed the Rams into perennial Super Bowl contenders.Fans and pundits alike are hoping Veronika’s rare appearance serves as a good-luck charm, pushing McVay and the Rams past Seattle and into a Super Bowl rematch against the New England Patriots. With history, family, and high stakes all intertwined, McVay’s 40th birthday feels like a pivotal moment in both his life and career.",Veronika McVay makes rare public appearance to support husband Sean.

Heading to Super Bowl LX? Here’s where Patriots fans can grab their tickets today



It’s been a long six years, but the New England Patriots are back in the Super Bowl. Sunday’s AFC Championship game was a defensive showdown, with the Patriots edging out the Denver Broncos 10-7 in snow-swept Denver. The win not only secured New England’s 12th conference title but also marked a turning point for a team that had struggled through consecutive 4-13 seasons under different head coaches.Quarterback Drake Maye led a team that relied heavily on defense and his legs to overcome a challenging game environment. “It’s a new team, it’s a new era,” Maye said. “I respect and appreciate what the Patriots dynasty did, and unfortunately they didn’t come out with some wins here, but we changed that narrative and look forward to bringing our best football for [the Super Bowl].”Drake Maye’s passing stats were modest: 10 completions on 21 attempts for 86 yards- but his mobility proved decisive. Early struggles forced New England to punt on its first four drives, and points were scarce. The offense finally found life in the second quarter when a defensive fumble recovery set up Maye’s 6-yard touchdown run to tie the game 7-7.“It was tough elements for offense, but the defenses were playing great,” Maye said.“Really just [giving us] a chance to not lose the game and turn the ball over or do something where we’re putting our defense in a bad spot. Our defense showed up every time, time and time again.”Maye’s scrambling ability continued to shape the game. His 28-yard run early in the third quarter set up the game-winning field goal, and a critical first down on a late third-and-6 play allowed the Patriots to run out the clock in victory formation. “It’s cool,” Maye said. “It’s pretty special. It’s something I won’t forget. Road warriors, 9-0 on the road, playing for this team and finishing in victory formation, I head-bumped Will [Campbell], and that was probably the hardest head bump of my life after I picked up the first down. ”With Super Bowl LX set for Feb. 8 at Levi’s Stadium in Santa Clara, Calif., Patriots fans can secure tickets through VividSeats, SeatGeek, or StubHub. After a season of transformation and resilience, New England is ready to return to football’s biggest stage, proving once again that perseverance and teamwork can rewrite a team’s destiny.","The New England Patriots beat the Denver Broncos 10-7 in the AFC Championship game.

Is Sam Darnold married ? What we know so far



Sam Darnold’s personal life is capturing just as much attention as his on-field performance, and the focus is on his fiancée, Katie Hoofnagle. The Seattle Seahawks quarterback, now eyeing a Super Bowl appearance in 2026, has had a rollercoaster journey across five NFL teams since 2018. As he is leading Seattle against the Los Angeles Rams in the NFC Championship on January 25, Hoofnagle is there by his side, offering unwavering support.Darnold has openly credited Hoofnagle for understanding the grind of professional football. In a March 2025 interview with Us Weekly, he said, “You know, the fact that she just understands it. She’s a former athlete herself, and just gets kind of the grind of everything. When I just want to chill, she’s very up for that, especially during the season.” He added, “She’s great. She’s always been my biggest supporter. And I love her, and I thank her for that all the time. ” Their partnership, both on and off the field, has become a highlight of Darnold’s journey in Seattle.The short answer is no. Darnold is not married yet, but his wedding is officially on the horizon. He and Hoofnagle got engaged in July 2025 in California, sharing a jubilant joint Instagram post simply captioned, “YES!!!!!” Their wedding is scheduled for April 3, 2026, meaning their engagement will be less than a year.Sources suggest that timing, more than anything else, has delayed their nuptials. With the NFL season and now a playoff run occupying Darnold’s schedule, wedding planning has understandably taken a backseat.Katie Hoofnagle, a University of South Carolina graduate, is a marketing specialist at Renvio, a company providing software for dialysis machines. Before that, she worked in finance in Charlotte, North Carolina, climbing the ranks from loan officer assistant to mortgage loan officer. The couple’s history hints at a North Carolina connection—Darnold played for the Carolina Panthers from 2021 to 2022, while Hoofnagle lived and worked there from 2020 to 2024. They went Instagram official in June 2023, though some reports suggest they may have met after Darnold’s trade to the San Francisco 49ers in March 2023.Despite the uncertainty of exact meeting details, the couple is clearly focused on enjoying their engagement. Fans following their journey can expect a post-season wedding celebration, while Darnold continues his quest for a Super Bowl victory with the Seahawks.","Sam Darnold and Katie Hoofnagle got engaged in July 2025 in California.

Drake Maye achieves postseason milestone Tom Brady never did, rewriting Patriots history in Denver



Drake Maye and his Super Bowl dreams are now reality in New England, forged not through nostalgia but through nerve, legs, and poise under pressure. On a snow-choked afternoon in Denver, the Patriots punched their ticket to the franchise’s 12th Super Bowl appearance, this time without the familiar shadows of Bill Belichick, Tom Brady, or Rob Gronkowski. What emerged instead was a new face of the franchise, calm in chaos and fearless when the elements stripped the game to its rawest form.The blizzard at Empower Field forced football back to its basics. Passing lanes vanished. Timing broke down. And yet, when New England needed answers, Drake Maye found them in ways few expected. He did not dominate the stat sheet through the air, but he dictated the game with sharp decisions, timely runs, and unshakable confidence. In doing so, he quietly rewrote a piece of Patriots playoff history.The defining edge came on the ground. With snow piling up and the Broncos daring New England to beat them another way, offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels leaned into Maye’s mobility. The gamble paid off. Maye gashed a disciplined Denver defense with decisive runs, including a perfectly sold fake handoff followed by a naked bootleg that sealed the win.Drake Maye powered the New England Patriots to the Super Bowl with grit and mobility in a snowbound AFC Championship win at Denver. The second-year quarterback broke a Tom Brady playoff rushing record, relied on his legs when passing failed, and led a new-era Patriots team one victory away from a championship.He finished the AFC Championship Game with just 86 passing yards, but his legs told the real story. Maye rushed 10 times for 65 yards and a touchdown, averaging 6.5 yards per carry. That output pushed his career postseason rushing total to 141 yards, surpassing Tom Brady’s playoff mark of 133. The touchdown, a quarterback draw, stood as the Patriots’ lone trip to the end zone in a 10-7 victory, complemented by a field goal from Andy Borregales.The moment carried deeper meaning.

The legacy continues, just in a different stride.","Drake Maye led the New England Patriots to the Super Bowl with grit and mobility in a snowbound AFC Championship win at Denver.

Drake Maye's Super Bowl run became real in the harshest setting possible, with snow, nerves, and history colliding in Denver on Sunday night.

In a game that felt more like survival than spectacle, Maye used grit and instinct to push his team past the Broncos and into Super Bowl LX. It was cold, chaotic, and unforgettable. While the stat sheet told a modest story, the moment told a bigger one.The 23-year-old quarterback threw for only 86 yards and failed to find the end zone through the air. Yet his legs rewrote the script. Ten rushes for 65 yards changed field position, tempo, and belief. His early rushing touchdown tied the game. His late scramble sealed it. For New England, this marked a return to the Super Bowl stage for the first time since the Tom Brady era ended in 2019.As snow piled up and visibility dropped, one voice cut through the moment off the field. Ann Michael, Maye’s wife, captured the emotion in a single post after the 10-7 win.

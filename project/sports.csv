India's ageing warriors Virat and Rohit seem to have turned the clock back at the perfect time

DUBAI: When the 2025 ICC Champions Trophy was about to begin, there were plenty of questions revolving around the future of India’s two modern-day greats of the game-superstar Virat Kohli and captain Rohit Sharma The debate around even their position in the team-it still stays relevant in the context of Test cricket-was justified, as across the eight Tests in different conditions in the three-Test series at home against New Zealand last year, and in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy in Australia after that, the superstar duo - barring Kohli’s century in the first Test at Perth - failed consistently.However, a change of colour of the ball and the format seems to have done the ‘Ro-Ko’ pair a world of good. In the ODI home series at home against England and then in the 2025 ICC Champions Trophy, both have inched their way back to their vintage best.After scoring one half-century (52) in the series against England, and succumbing for 22 while trying to cut leggie Rishad Hossain, Kohli, who was persistently dismissed by deliveries on the channel on or outside the off-stump, was criticised for being vulnerable to spinners too.However, on Sunday night at the Dubai International Stadium, the 36-year-old, under pressure to deliver against arch-rivals Pakistan in a key Group A match of the Champions Trophy, cracked his 51st hundred- a majestic, unbeaten 100-extending his record to a whopping 51st ODI century, to help India romp to a 242-run chase with 45 balls left in the match.While he kept unleashing those exquisite cover drives, Kohli ran between the wickets at lightning speed and has taken a few sharp catches at point and in the deep, proving that he is still one of the fittest cricketers around in Team India and perhaps in world cricket.Struggling at one point to even get into double figures and being forced to opt himself out of the Sydney Test, Rohit, who cracked 119 against England against Cuttack in the second ODI earlier this month to dust off his horrible run, has fired cameos of 36-ball 41 against Bangladesh and 15-ball 20 against Pakistan in the Champions Trophy, providing India with the perfect kind of brisk starts which crack the game open right away. Much to India's relief, the 37-year-old has rediscovered his lazy elegance.On Sunday, talking to reporters during the India versus Pakistan match, former India opener Shikhar Dhawan , had brushed off concerns about Kohli’s low returns during the last few months before the batter unleashed his latest masterclass. “It’s a normal phase which every cricketer has faced in his career. For someone who is about to complete 14,000 ODI runs, Virat has a complete idea about his game. He’s also a human being! He’s a very big player. He knows how to make runs. It's just about one good innings. Once he plays one good knock, this whole pressure (on him), this talk (about his poor form) will vanish quickly. This is why his name is ‘King’ Kohli. He has earned that sobriquet,” Dhawan said.Pakistan, of course, are in awe of Kohli. In 17 ODIs, the veteran warrior has slammed 778 runs against them, with four hundreds and two fifties, at an average of 59.84, and a highest score of 183 not out.Asked about how Kohli always manages to score big runs against Pakistan - he was supposed to be out of form coming into this game- Pakistan captain Rizwan Ahmed complimented, “I’m surprised at his hard work. He must have worked really hard. The world says he is out of form, but he comes to these big matches, which the world is waiting for, and easily hits the ball. We don’t want to give him runs, but he plays (well) and gets away from us. As a cricketer, I will definitely praise his fitness level and hard work. We tried hard to get him out, but he took the game away (from us). The whole world said he was out of form, but he did it in this big match.”Having seen Kohli’s century from close quarters-he scored a fluent 67-ball 56 in a 114-run partnership with the senior batter, Shreyas Iyer said, “I've never thought of Virat struggling for runs. It's just the mindset that he possesses over the years. He's always hungry for runs and I remember yesterday he had come almost an hour before us for the practice session. He played a few balls, and he was looking as crisp as he looks all the time.”Asked if Rohit and Kohli-both India’s ageing superstars should make way for the newcomers now, Dhawan asserted, “I feel that the seniors are very important. They pass on their experiences to the youngsters. The youngsters coming into the side should always look up to someone. The seniors’ presence makes a huge difference. Virat’s presence at the crease is very big. The opposition fears him. So, Virat and Rohit have a lot of cricket left in them.”Dhawan pointed out the value of the quickfire starts that Rohit has been providing, which frees up India from the pressure of the run rate. “It’s not always about scoring a century or a half-century. Like today, Rohit chipped in with a quick 20. That also carried a value. He has created a fearless environment for the whole team. He got out, that’s fine. But he created that energy, and now the other (Indian) batsmen are riding on it,” the retired left-hander pointed out.","India's ageing warriors Virat and Rohit seem to have turned the clock back at the perfect time. Kohli scored his 51st hundred- a majestic, unbeaten 100-extending his record to a whopping 51st ODI century, to help India romp to a 242-run chase.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118532413,imgsize-49136,width-400,resizemode-4/118532413.jpg"

Australia vs South Africa

: High-stakes battle for knockout berth

EXCLUSIVE: 'Rohit Sharma way better than Virat Kohli and Babar Azam' | Former Pakistan pacer

New Zealand and India have stormed into the semi-finals of the ICC Champions Trophy 2025 from Group A, leaving hosts Pakistan and Bangladesh out of contention.Rachin Ravindra 's sublime 112 powered New Zealand to a five-wicket win over Bangladesh in Rawalpindi on Monday, sealing their knockout berth and in turn confirming India’s progression as well. Both teams now boast two wins in two matches and will clash in Dubai on Sunday to determine the group winner.The tournament has been a disaster for Pakistan, the defending champions and hosts of their first ICC event since the 1996 ODI World Cup. They suffered back-to-back defeats against New Zealand and India, ending their campaign prematurely.New Zealand have been the dominant force in Group A, following up their emphatic 60-run win over Pakistan with a composed chase against Bangladesh. Michael Bracewell’s career-best 4-36 set up the victory, restricting Bangladesh to 236/9. New Zealand stuttered early but found stability in Ravindra’s ton and Tom Latham’s 55, securing a comfortable chase.With the Group A semi-finalists locked in, the focus now shifts to Group B, where Australia and South Africa will clash in a crucial match on Tuesday in Rawalpindi. Both sides, brimming with batting firepower, will look to take a decisive step toward the semi-finals.Australia, often doubted before ICC events, proved their critics wrong with a stunning record-breaking chase against England in Lahore, showcasing their resilience once again.Dew played a major role in that match and could influence the outcome again in Rawalpindi. Australia’s depleted bowling attack, missing Pat Cummins, Mitchell Starc and Josh Hazlewood, is a concern, but their audacious batting — led by Josh Inglis, Matthew Short, Marnus Labuschagne, Alex Carey and Glenn Maxwell — has been a revelation.South Africa, meanwhile, will rely on their more potent bowling attack, spearheaded by Kagiso Rabada , to challenge Australia. Ryan Rickelton’s aggressive century against Afghanistan, coupled with strong middle-order performances, has boosted their confidence. However, Heinrich Klaasen’s availability remains uncertain after missing the previous match due to injury.Despite an underwhelming build-up, South Africa remain determined to challenge for the title, while Australia aim to prove their tournament pedigree once again. With a semi-final berth on the line, expect a high-stakes, high-intensity battle in Rawalpindi.","New Zealand and India have qualified for the semi-finals of the ICC Champions Trophy 2025 from Group A, leaving hosts Pakistan and Bangladesh out of contention.

""I think things like that don't really happen too often.""He said: ""I'm very grateful to have a great support crew around me in terms of Black Caps set up, coaches and doc and physio that have been able to come out of it reasonably well and I'm extremely grateful for the love and support of everyone.""With New Zealand struggling at 15-2, Ravindra came into bat and came up with some crucial stands, notably a 129-run fourth-wicket partnership with Tom Latham , who scored 55.The knock came after Michael Bracewell used off-spin to return figures of 4-26 and limit Bangladesh to 236-9.""It's obviously been interesting dealing with the return to play protocols and stuff,"" said Ravindra.""But having the support around me has been great and being able to come here and contribute to a win for the Black Caps, an environment that I hold dearly and I enjoy so much playing for... it was cool to come back and really enjoy my cricket again after that weird moment.""After hitting a ton on his 2023 ODI World Cup debut and adding another later in the tournament against Pakistan, Ravindra's most recent innings confirmed his passion for ICC events.""He's doing Rachin things I guess,"" said skipper Mitchell Santner who was full of praise for the 25-year-old who struck 12 fours and a six.""He loves ICC events. Looks like he never left the game. He wasn't as fluid as he'd have liked but when he gets going he's tough to stop. His partnerships were good too.""On Sunday, New Zealand will play India in their last group encounter in Dubai.","Rachin Ravindra hits match-winning 112 as New Zealand beat Bangladesh in Champions Trophy.

NEW DELHI: Two sides with a lot of batting strength, Australia and South Africa, will try to outmuscle one another in Rawalpindi on Tuesday in order to advance to the Champions Trophy semifinals.Few were giving a diminished Australia a chance in the competition, but they once again demonstrated their ability to step up in ICC competitions with their historic chase against England in Lahore.The dew helped the pursuing team the other night in Lahore and might help them again in Rawalpindi.Australia will undoubtedly miss the pace trio of Josh Hazlewood, Mitchell Starc, and Pat Cummins during the tournament, but their bold batting performance made up for it at least in the first game.After playing the innings of his life, with runs also coming from Matthew Short, Marnus Labuschagne, Alex Carey, and Glenn Maxwell Josh Inglis must be feeling extremely confident.Only captain Steve Smith and opener Travis Head remain in the batting lineup, and they have a chance to score a significant knock against the Proteas.Maxwell was again on the costly side against England, and left-arm pacer Spencer Johnson should have put up a stronger bowling display. Labuschagne and Short are set to share the job as sixth bowler.After a century against Afghanistan, Ryan Rickleton would be smiling with confidence in the South African dressing room, just like Inglis. Striking half-centuries at numbers three, four, and five bode well for the team captained by Temba Bavuma Due to an injury, Heinrich Klaasen was unable to play in the last game, and it is uncertain if he will play on Tuesday.With Kagiso Rabada at the forefront, South Africa's pace attack is unquestionably more potent than their rivals'.South Africa did not have the ideal build-ups for the Champions Trophy because their first-choice players were unavailable, but they are still supporting themselves to win.""I think as a group we might not have had the best results coming into this tournament, but quietly I think everyone's quite confident. We do have incredibly good players in this team, not just in the team but obviously the whole squad as well,"" said Rickleton.""There's guys that are maybe a bit young in the side as well that are also looking to make an impact. But I don't think we're too burdened by the hunt to win the whole thing.""Obviously, we're here to do that. But we don't let that restrict us.

NEW DELHI: A returning Rachin Ravindra put up a batting masterclass, slamming a solid ton to steer New Zealand to an easy five-wicket win over Bangladesh in the Champions Trophy Group A game in Rawalpindi on Monday.The win secured semifinal spots for both New Zealand and India from the group while eliminating hosts Pakistan and Bangladesh from the tournament.India and New Zealand have maintained perfect records with two wins each, including victories against Pakistan.Pakistan, hosting an ICC tournament for the first time since the 1996 World Cup, needed a lot of results to go their way to ensure their qualification for the semifinals after the first two losses.

New Zealand vs Bangladesh: A decisive clash

EXCLUSIVE | Rohit Sharma way better than Virat Kohli and Babar Azam: Former Pakistan pacer

NEW DELHI: Star batter Virat Kohli produced a vintage knock, scoring an unbeaten 100 to steer India to a dominant six-wicket victory over Pakistan in the ICC Champions Trophy . Kohli’s match-winning century pushed the defending champions Pakistan to the brink of elimination, leaving them reliant on Bangladesh to keep their hopes alive.Chasing 242, India lost Rohit Sharma (20) early to Shaheen Afridi, but a solid 69-run stand between Kohli and Shubman Gill (46) ensured stability. Kohli played a measured innings, becoming only the third player to surpass 14,000 ODI runs, following legends Sachin Tendulkar (18,426) and Kumar Sangakkara (14,234). His 51st ODI century, reached in 111 balls, sealed the match with 45 balls to spare, propelling India to the top of Group A with two wins in two games.""My job was to control the middle overs and take on the pacers later,"" Kohli said post-match. ""It's about managing expectations, keeping my energy levels in check, and focusing on my game.""With India virtually sealing their semifinal spot, attention now shifts to the crucial New Zealand vs Bangladesh clash on Monday. The Black Caps, who defeated Pakistan by 60 runs in their opener, will secure qualification with a win. Their strong net run rate (1.200) gives them an edge.Bangladesh, reeling from a six-wicket loss to India, face a must-win scenario. Their net run rate (-0.408) leaves them in a vulnerable position, and a defeat would knock them out. Bangladesh’s batting lineup, which struggled against India, must step up against New Zealand’s formidable pace attack.New Zealand, meanwhile, face a selection dilemma with Rachin Ravindra potentially returning from injury. The Kiwis will look to continue their clinical performances and avoid any surprises, knowing that Bangladesh stunned them in the 2017 edition to knock them out.If New Zealand win, Pakistan will be eliminated, and the semifinalists from Group A will be confirmed. However, if Bangladesh triumph, the group will remain wide open, making for an intense final round of matches.","Virat Kohli scores unbeaten 100 to guide India to six-wicket victory over Pakistan.

I remember yesterday, he had come almost an hour before us for the practice session and he played a few balls and he was looking from outside.""He looked as crisp as he looks all the time.

There is no injury concern to them,"" he said.Iyer had a two-layered innings, first concentrating on singles and then opening up to punish the Pakistan bowlers.The 30-year-old gave an explanation of the reasoning for his strategy.""See, it is clear as sweeps and reverse sweeps cannot be played straightaway. But rotating the strike is going to be important because that puts a decent amount of pressure on the bowlers.""They keep changing their line lengths. And once you keep taking singles, the bowlers are more under pressure and you can keep hitting the scoreboard from there on,"" he added.On his aggressive approach in the latter part of the innings, Iyer said: ""I love to take on the bowlers when we are under pressure. And that is my mindset. If we take charge, if we gain the momentum towards us, then it is easy to steady the ship.""And from there on, the rest of the batsmen, when they come in, it becomes easy for them.""Iyer praised the Indian spinners for keeping the Pakistani batsmen quiet in the middle overs.""They bowled tremendously, especially in the middle phase where the ball was turning. As we know, even in the previous game when we played over here, the wicket is a bit slow.""It's spinner friendly and the way they have been bowling consistently over a period of time, I think the amalgamation of all three bowlers mixing up quite well, also the experience that they possess. I think that brings a lot of clarity in their bowling,"" he said.","Shreyas Iyer describes India's Champions Trophy win over Pakistan as ""sweet"" India all but guaranteed a spot in the ICC showcase semifinals with victory. Iyer praised his senior teammate Virat Kohli for reaching a century with ease. Mumbaikar also eased worries about injuries to veteran pacer Mohammed Shami and captain Rohit Sharma.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118516120,imgsize-50370,width-400,resizemode-4/118516120.jpg"

Champions Trophy: 'Any victory against Pakistan is sweet,' says Shreyas Iyer

LIVE from Dubai: It’s that man Virat Kohli, AGAIN. India humiliate Pakistan in Champions Trophy

Another ODI run-chase, another hundred, another win and the story continues...When the helmet came off and the bat was pointed towards the stands, Virat Kohli was not just celebrating his 51st ODI hundred but also another clinical run-chase as India outclassed Pakistan in the Champions Trophy by six wickets. An assuring gesture for his childhood coach Rajkumar Sharma, who was in attendance at the Dubai International Stadium , followed and he then turned towards the dressing room to acknowledge the applause.The King was back in his elements, back to his dominant best, back to calculating and mastering run chases and back to the showmanship. Nobody, nobody does it better than Kohli in this format and his control during run-chases can be a case study for future generations.The risk element is completely eliminated as he prefers to pick the gaps and avoids the flashy, airy approach unless there's a desperate need for it. The ones effortlessly become twos and the fielders in the ring are kept on their toes as a quick-single is always on the cards. Alarm bells start ringing for the opposition if the cover-drives connect and it happened twice during a Haris Rauf over early in Kohli's innings. While the first was a more cautious check shot, the other was way more fluent and would have switched the Chase Master™ on in the big game vs Pakistan.He thrives in situations like these and Sunday was another reminder of why he remains the absolute beast in 50-over cricket. The staggering numbers are a testament to that but more than the numbers, it's how he he builds a run-chase and then controls it. Even when the boundaries don't come, the sprints between the wickets keep his strike-rate hovering in the 90s and there were as many as 46 singles and 13 doubles during his unbeaten hundred. The fitness levels were tested under the unforgiving sun but in spite of staying on the field for more than 85 overs, he was pushing for those doubles towards the fag end of the chase.In a chat with the broadcaster after the match, Kohli spoke about the knock, keeping the ""noise away"" and how the next few days will be about keeping the feet up and recharging the batteries before India's last group stage fixture vs New Zealand on March 2.Also See: ICC Champions Trophy Points Table 2025 ""My job was to control the middle overs against the spinners without taking too many risks, towards the end Shreyas accelerated and I got a few boundaries as well. It allowed me to play my usual ODI game. I have a decent understanding of my game, it is about keeping the outside noise away, staying in my space and taking care of my energy levels and thoughts,"" said Kohli.""To be honest, at 36, it feels really good. Will put my feet up for a few days as it takes a lot out of me to put that kind of effort into every game,"" he added.The story is set to continue for a bit longer as the protagonist still has enough gas in the tank. He scaled Mt 14,000 on Sunday, scored his 82nd hundred in international cricket , collected a record Player of the Match award but it was just another day of Kohli doing Kohli things.","Virat Kohli scored an unbeaten century in India's win against Pakistan in the Champions Trophy.

NEW DELHI: India captain Rohit Sharma downplayed worries about his fitness on Sunday after taking an unplanned break during his team's six-wicket victory over Pakistan in a pivotal Champions Trophy group A match in Dubai.It appeared that Rohit had injured his hamstring as he was observed straining during fielding. At the presentation ceremony, the captain, who also briefly left the field during the Pakistan innings, responded that he was ""okay"" when questioned about his hamstring.""Hamstring's okay at the moment,"" the 37-year-old said in the presentation ceremony following the win that has almost clinched a semifinal slot for India. Virat Kohli , who reached his 51st ODI century with the game-winning boundary down the off-side, was clearly the day's star, even if the bowlers set the stage by dismissing Pakistan for 241.Rohit lavished his longtime India teammate with admiration.""Virat loves representing the country, doing what he does the best, which is what he did today. People sitting inside the dressing room aren't surprised with what he did,"" Rohit said.With Kohli fewer than ten runs from reaching his century and India drawing closer to victory, Rohit was spotted urging the star batsman to reach the milestone with a few big hits.Rohit said all the players did what was required of them.""We started superbly with the ball. We knew wicket could get slower but backed our experienced batters to go out there and get 240. Credit goes to Kuldeep, Axar, Jadeja who have played a lot.""(Mohammad) Rizwan and Saud (Shakeel) stitched a good stand, it was important not to let the game drift. Not to forget how (Mohammed) Shami, Hardik (Pandya), and Harshit (Rana) bowled as well. It was a good performance from the entire unit. Boys understand what kind of job is required out of them.Also See: Champions Trophy 2025 Points table ""It's tricky at times because not all will get to bowl. I try to figure out who's creating the most problems to the batters and make decisions,"" Rohit said.Pakistan captain Muhammad Rizwan claimed that bad shot selection hurt their cause after they chose to bat first and urged fielding to be improved.""We won the toss, but we didn't get the benefit of toss. Their bowlers bowled very well. Me and Saud Shakeel , we wanted to take it deep. But our shot selection was bad and we lost wickets, which is why we were kept to 240,"" Rizwan said.Tournament hosts Pakistan's second loss in the competition puts them in danger of being eliminated.Rizwan added, ""They put us under pressure. Whenever you lose, you didn't perform in all departments. We wanted to squeeze, but we couldn't.""Kohli and Gill batted very well and took the game away. We need to improve in our fielding. We did a lot of mistakes in this match."" Shubman Gill was dismissed for 46 by spinner Abrar Ahmed , who said he did not regret sending the Indian batsman out in a heated fashion. Ahmed said he attempted to maintain discipline.""It's not an issue. I celebrate the same way even when I get wickets in Pakistan. Match is about winning and losing,"" said Abrar, who finished with impressive figures of 1/28 in 10 overs.Additionally, he claimed that batting in the second innings was easier.""The wicket was much better to bat in the second innings.

And then, Virat Kohli skipped out of the crease, unleashed that thunderous cover drive off Khushdil Shah for a four, and there it was. Century no 51 in the ODIs-two more than the legendary Sachin Tendulkar 's 49, and the first since the landmark No 50 came, with Tendulkar watching, at the Wankhede Stadium in the 2023 World Cup semifinals against New Zealand.Soon after hitting the boundary which took him past his ton and India to a seven-wicket win over a listless Pakistan, Kohli took his helmet off and looked towards the skies, and then asked his captain, Rohit Sharma to calm down, since he was there in the middle!Shrugging off all talk about his ability to play spin, 'King Kohli,' who trained for an extra couple of hours on the eve of this match against the local spinners with India's batting coaches to help him out, roared back into form in grand style when it mattered in the big game-or is an India versus Pakistan match even a big game anymore considering that India cruise through it nowadays without much challenge?Unleashing his vintage form with premier pacer Jasprit Bumrah , currently out injured, and India's T20 captain Suryakumar Yadav watching from the stands along with several other former cricketing stars of India and Pakistan, India's ageing warrior, bring out is vintage form, cracked a regal century (100 not out, 111b, 7x4), adding 114 in 128 balls for the third wicket with the in-form Shreyas Iyer (56, 67b, 5x4, 1x6) to help India coast to a comfortable six-wicket win over Pakistan in a Group A match of the 2025 ICC Champions Trophy on Sunday night at the Dubai International Stadium.Also See: Champions Trophy 2025 Points Table Going past the landmark of 14,000 ODI runs - by reaching there in just his 287th innings, he broke Tendulkar's record (350 innings) during his umpteenth memorable knock with a trademark cover drive off Haris Rauf, the 36-year-old reached his half-century, off 62 balls, with a four to deep cover for four off Shaheen Shah Afridi.Riding on Kohli's magic, India, the 2023 World Cup finalists, have now virtually entered the semifinals of the Champions Trophy. Meanwhile, much to their embarrassment and their fans' disappointment, the crushing defeat to their arch-rivals has almost sent Pakistan, the defending champions and the tournament hosts, packing after they lost their first two matches to New Zealand and India. If New Zealand beat Bangladesh in Rawalpindi on Monday, India are through to the last four, while Pakistan will be officially out.Apart from their below-par bowling and batting, Pakistan were left to rue their poor fielding too, as they left off Iyer on 25 when Saud Shakeel dropped a chance at mid-wicket off Khushdil Shah. Khushdil himself was guilty of dropping India opener Shubman Gill at mid-wicket in the 11th over off Rauf.Continuing his blazing form, Gill cracked a stroke-filled 46 (52b, 7x4) before he was castled by a 'jaffa' from leggie Abrar Ahmed-the ball turned a fair bit to hit the top of the off-stump- while Indian captain Rohit Sharma again provided India a brisk start with a 15-ball 20-run cameo that included three fours and a six. Rohit lost his middle stump to a superb inswinging yorker unleashed by Shaheen Shah Afridi, conjuring up memories of an lbw dismissal for duck at the hands of a similar 'masterpiece' by Afridi back in the 2021 T20 World Cup.That was the only cheer for Pakistan and Afridi on the night, as the left-arm quick went for 2-74 in eight overs.Earlier, delivering an efficient show, India's bowlers wrapped up Pakistan's innings for 241 in 49.4 overs.Opting to bat first after winning the toss, Pakistan, apart from a phase when middle-order batters Saud Shakeel (62, 76b, 5x4) and skipper Mohammed Rizwan (46, 77b, 3x4) added 104 for the third wicket in 144 balls, kept losing wickets regularly, with Chinaman bowler Kuldeep Yadav (three for 40 in nine overs) and allrounder Hardik Pandya (2-31 in eight overs) being the pick of the lot.Fighting for survival in the tournament, Pakistan's plight would've been worse had it not been for a cameo by Khushdil, who followed up on his 49-ball 69 in the last match against New Zealand with a crucial 38 (39b, 2x6), even as the 2017 Champions Trophy winners, suffering a late collapse, lost their last five wickets for just 41 runs in 42 balls.Openers Imam-ul-Haq and Babar Azam added 41 in 50 balls, before Pandya broke the partnership in the ninth over as Babar Azam (23, 26b, 5x4), who was looking impressive till then, nicked an away going ball behind.Pakistan lost their other opener in the next over itself when Imam ul Haq, included at the last minute after both first-choice openers Saim Ayub and Fakhar Zaman were ruled out injured, was run out for 10 while going for a risky single, as a direct hit by Axar Patel, from mid-on found him short.","India beat Pakistan by seven wickets in Champions Trophy Group A match.

This is the truth. As a captain, I don't like depending on others. If you are good enough, you show it by winning and keeping things in your hands. Waiting on other teams, I don't like worrying about their results. What matters is that India and New Zealand beat us. We accept it. They played strong and we didn't play well.

""When you lose, you're obviously disappointed and it's a difficult time, difficult questions come up. We made mistakes in all three departments, that is why we lost today.

NEW DELHI: England have made a strategic change to their squad for the Champions Trophy 2025 , replacing injured fast bowler Brydon Carse with the young leg-spinning all-rounder Rehan Ahmed .The ICC Event Technical Committee has officially approved this replacement ahead of England's crucial group-stage matches.Carse, aged 29, featured in England's tournament opener against Australia, where the defending champions successfully chased down a challenging target, handing Jos Buttler 's side a five-wicket defeat.However, Carse has been hampered by a persistent blister on his left foot, severely impacting his ability to bowl effectively. His injury worsened after the opening match, forcing him to miss England's training session at the Gaddafi Stadium in Lahore on Monday.Recognising the potential impact on Carse's availability for the remainder of the tournament, the team management decided to bring in Ahmed as a replacement.The 19-year-old leg-spinner has already represented England in six ODIs and is regarded as a promising talent within the national setup. His inclusion adds a fresh spin-bowling option to England's squad, providing more variety alongside Adil Rashid With qualification for the semi-finals at stake, England may also consider making additional changes to their playing XI.Jamie Overton, who was left out of the first game, could now be in contention for a spot in the next match against Afghanistan as England look to recover from their opening defeat.The approval of squad replacements in ICC tournaments is overseen by the Event Technical Committee, which consists of ICC officials, representatives from the host nation, and an independent former international cricketer.As England prepare for their next group match against Afghanistan on Wednesday, the inclusion of Ahmed adds a new dimension to their bowling attack, potentially providing the necessary impetus to bounce back from their opening loss.",England have replaced fast bowler Brydon Carse with leg-spinning all-rounder Rehan Ahmed.

With that, Pakistan became the third host nation, after India and South Africa, to be eliminated in the group stage of the tournament.In a dead rubber on Thursday, Pakistan will lock horns against Bangladesh in their final group-stage match of the tournament.Over the years, different nations have hosted the ICC Champions Trophy, with varying levels of success for the home teams.In 1998, Bangladesh was awarded hosting rights to promote cricket in the country, though they did not participate as they were not yet a Test-playing nation. Despite devastating floods threatening the tournament, it went ahead, with 10% of gate revenue donated to flood relief efforts.In 2000, Kenya hosted the event but was eliminated in the pre-quarter-finals after an eight-wicket loss to India, with Rahul Dravid starring with the bat and Anil Kumble winning Player of the Match.In 2002, Sri Lanka hosted and topped their group, eventually reaching the final against India. However, rain on both the final and reserve days forced the teams to share the trophy.England hosted the 2004 edition, reaching the final but losing to the West Indies.In 2006, India hosted the tournament but failed to progress past the group stage, finishing behind Australia and the West Indies.South Africa hosted in 2009 but had a disappointing campaign, finishing fourth in their group and failing to advance.England and Wales hosted again in 2013, with India defeating the hosts in the final to claim their second Champions Trophy title.In 2017, England once again hosted but were eliminated in the semi-finals by Pakistan, who went on to win their maiden Champions Trophy.Now, in 2025, Pakistan hosted the tournament but suffered an early exit, marking another instance where the host nation failed to capitalise on home advantage.","Pakistan are knocked out of the ICC Champions Trophy 2025 after back-to-back defeats against New Zealand and India.

Champions Trophy: 'India put in more effort, were braver than us,' admits Mohammad Rizwan

NEW DELHI: Former chairman of the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) and cricketer Ramiz Raja raised concerns about Pakistan's strategy in the Champions Trophy after their six-wicket defeat to India in the Champions Trophy on Sunday.He questioned the decision to start their campaign against New Zealand instead of Bangladesh, considering Bangladesh as a relatively easier opponent compared to New Zealand.Raja believed that playing Bangladesh first would have put equal pressure on both teams in Group A, rather than allowing New Zealand to gain an early advantage. Pakistan's defeat to New Zealand added unnecessary pressure on the team, which was further compounded by their loss to India.""I wonder why Pakistan played their first match against New Zealand. They should have played their first match against Bangladesh. Even though Bangladesh is a strong side, it was still comparatively an easy match for them,"" Ramiz said on his YouTube channel.In the high-stakes clash against India, Virat Kohli 's exceptional performance played a pivotal role in jeopardising Pakistan's title defence. Kohli's unbeaten century, coupled with his calm and attacking approach, guided India to a six-wicket victory, leaving Pakistan in a precarious position.Ramiz praised Kohli's knock, describing it as a complete package, adding, ""Virat's knock had everything. There was calmness and attack. He maintained the pace well. Overall, Virat Kohli was a complete package. He keeps on challenging himself. He played confidently against every bowler and didn't allow anyone to settle.""","Former chairman of the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) and cricketer Ramiz Raja raised concerns about Pakistan's strategy in the Champions Trophy.

NEW DELHI: Former Indian cricketer Navjot Singh Sidhu hailed Virat Kohli 's outstanding performance against Pakistan, predicting that Kohli will play for another 2-3 years and possibly score 10-15 more centuries.In the Champions Trophy group match against Pakistan, Kohli crafted an unbeaten century, scoring 100 runs from 111 deliveries at a strike rate of 90.09. His innings proved crucial in India's successful chase of Pakistan's 241. This marked Kohli's first Champions Trophy century and his sixth overall in ICC ODI tournaments.""Character is not made in a crisis, it is exhibited. This is a man (Virat Kohli) with pedigree, with passion. And after this 100, I can say with conviction that this man is playing for the next 2 or 3 years and he is getting another 10 or 15 hundreds. That, you take it from me. Because, you see, the ultimate litmus test for anyone is how he goes through the adverse times, and how he embraces adversity. In the last six months, there has been so much going on that he chose his moment. When he scored runs against Pakistan, people are not going to forget it for 10 years,"" Navjot Singh Sidhu told JioHotstar.In Sidhu's assessment, Kohli serves as an exemplary figure for young cricketers.""Look, when you assess Virat Kohli, what is his trademark? If I look at Sachin Tendulkar , it was always the backfoot punch that he would give. Look at Gavaskar, the straight drive. When you look at Virat Kohli, it's the cover drive. And when he gets his head on top of the ball and he's cover driving beautifully, you know he's back. If you look at the initial part of his innings, if you look at these drives, you know that this is the Virat Kohli of old. And to me, it's the character that he exhibited when the chips were down. These are the people who've inspired the kids in the street,"" Sidhu said.""For the game to grow, you need role models, who are above everything. Virat Kohli is a once-in-a-generation cricketer, a 'Kohinoor'. You must understand the value that he brings to international cricket- 99 innings, and an average of 89.6 in successful chases means that he handles pressure without allowing it to affect him. And the tougher it gets, the more he thrives in that situation. That's the hallmark of a great cricketer,"" Sidhu added.Kohli's brilliant performance against Pakistan demonstrated his ability to adapt his batting style to match the situation, leading India to a significant victory against their traditional rivals.","Former Indian cricketer Navjot Singh Sidhu hails Virat Kohli's outstanding performance against Pakistan.

NEW DELHI: New Zealand’s all-rounder Michael Bracewell stole the show with a four-wicket haul, helping his side restrict Bangladesh to 236 for nine in their Champions Trophy clash in Rawalpindi on Monday. The left-handed batter and off-spinner delivered impressive figures of 4/26 in his 10 overs, setting the tone for a disciplined New Zealand performance.Bangladesh’s innings was anchored by skipper Najmul Hossain Shanto , who top-scored with 77 off 110 balls, though his efforts couldn’t prevent a collapse in the middle overs.Number seven Jaker Ali provided a spark with 45 off 55 balls, offering a glimpse of what could have been if the top and middle order had been more consistent.New Zealand’s decision to field early didn’t yield immediate breakthroughs as Shanto and Tanzid Hasan built a 45-run opening stand before Tanzid was dismissed for a run-a-ball 24 by Bracewell. The left-hander’s well-disguised delivery caught Tanzid off guard, and a diving catch by Kane Williamson at midwicket soon followed.Bangladesh’s Mehidy Hasan Miraz got off to a flying start, using his feet to drive a Bracewell delivery for a six, but his momentum faded after misjudging a fuller ball on the pads.As Shanto continued to accumulate runs, New Zealand struck again by dismissing Towhid Hridoy for just 7, thanks to a brilliant catch by Williamson, who sprinted from extra cover to secure the dismissal.With Bangladesh reeling at 97 for three in the 21st over, Mushfiqur Rahim was brought in to steady the ship. However, his contribution was short-lived, as he managed only two runs off five balls before falling to Bracewell, who was enjoying a highly productive spell.Mushfiqur attempted to counter the pressure with a slog-sweep, but his shot lacked the power needed, and Rachin Ravindra completed the catch at deep midwicket.Skipper Shanto eventually reached his half-century with a single to deep square leg, but the damage had been done — the team’s batters had played 86 dot balls in the first 21 overs.Bracewell then wrapped up his impressive performance by claiming his fourth wicket after Mahmudullah’s leading edge cost him dearly. The dismissal of Shanto by William O’Rourke further cemented New Zealand’s dominance, complicating Bangladesh’s path to a comeback.",New Zealand restrict Bangladesh to 236 for nine in their Champions Trophy clash in Rawalpindi.

NEW DELHI: England's campaign in the Champions Trophy has encountered an early setback, with fast bowler Brydon Carse likely to miss their crucial Group B encounter against Afghanistan on Wednesday due to a blister on his left foot.The 29-year-old pacer, who featured in England's opening five-wicket defeat to Australia, has been struggling with the injury, raising concerns about his availability for the remainder of the tournament.Carse's absence from England's training session at the Gaddafi Stadium on Monday has forced the team management to consider their options, with Jamie Overton potentially being handed a spot in the playing XI.With only three group-stage games to secure a semi-final berth, England's selection dilemma comes at a critical juncture.Veteran batter Joe Root expressed cautious optimism about Carse's recovery but acknowledged that the next 48 hours would be crucial in determining his availability.""We will have to wait and see,"" Root stated. ""There is still a good way to go until the game, to find exactly what is up with Carsey. We will see how things pan out over the next few days.""Carse's potential absence would be a significant blow for England, who are already under pressure following their defeat to Australia. The fast bowler's raw pace and ability to generate bounce were expected to play a key role against Afghanistan's aggressive batting lineup, despite his expensive outing against Australia.Currently third in Group B, England needs a win to stay in contention for the semi-finals. With South Africa and Australia leading the group, another loss could leave the English team in a precarious position.If Carse fails to recover in time, England has the option to call in a replacement for the rest of the tournament, but their immediate focus remains on finding the right balance for the must-win clash against Afghanistan.",England fast bowler Brydon Carse likely to miss Group B clash against Afghanistan.

When Afghanistan stalwart Rashid Khan lifted the IPL 2022 trophy following the Gujarat Titans ' (GT) stunning triumph in their maiden IPL season, he must have certainly experienced a wave of jubilation. Well, why wouldn't he, having won his first-ever trophy while representing a team?While individual accolades had come his way, the feeling of lifting the trophy after winning a tournament hits differently.Rashid would have certainly expected more silverware to come his way after being named the captain of SA20 franchise Mumbai Indians Cape Town (MICT).However, the cricketer as well as fans of the franchise were in for a shocker as MICT finished bottom in the inaugural season.While the campaign started off with a win against Paarl Royals, it was soon followed by a loss against Durban Super Giants (DSG).MICT only managed to win two out of the remaining eight matches. Rashid personally had a season to forget, accounting for nine wickets in 10 matches. Kagiso Rabada was the franchise's top wicket-taker, picking 11 wickets while Roelof van der Merwe, the season's top wicket-taker accounted for 20 dismissals in comparison.There was a clear gap even in the run-scoring charts with MICT's Rassie van der Dussen (243) finishing as the team's leading run-scorer in comparison to the league's top run-getter Jos Buttler (391).To make matters worse, Rashid was ruled out of the tournament's second season due to a back injury. Things were expected to take a turn for the better under the leadership of MI legend Kieron Pollard . While MICT started off the season with a narrow 11-run loss against DSG, they bounced back with a 98-run win against Joburg Super Kings (JSK).However, old habits die hard as they say. Inconsistency crept in and matches were conceded from positions of power. MICT's struggle clearly reflected in their 10-wicket loss against JSK, whom they'd thumped earlier. While Ryan Rickleton (530) led the run-scoring charts, the South African was largely left waging a long battle. Even Rabada had an average season by his lofty standards, picking nine wickets. MICT finished bottom of the table for the second consecutive year, resulting in a wave of despair and hopelessness all around. There was even talk of a complete overhaul in the squad buildup, indicating the uncertainty.However, as the saying goes, ""It is often in the darkest skies that we see the brightest stars."" Just when things seemed done and dusted for MICT, in came Rashid to save the day. ""I got a phone call ahead of the third season asking whether I wanted to lead. I said yes,"" said the Afghanistan all-rounder.A team which had struggled to string together even a couple of wins in the previous editions suddenly found its groove.One of the key factors behind this turnaround was the dominance in powerplay and intent shown consistently by Rassie, Rickleton, Dewald Brevis and George Linde.Batting first had been a concern for MICT in the opening two editions, with only three wins in 11 matches batting first. Things changed in the third season as MICT won six out of their eight completed matches batting first.There was an all-round focus on performances with unheralded players like Delano Potgieter making their presence felt. A team which was rock bottom managed to pull off a miracle reaching the tournament's final.However, the sternest of challenges awaited them, with Sunrisers Eastern Cape (SEC) their opponents for this tough encounter. SEC had won the previous two editions of the tournament, entering the final for the third consecutive time.Rassie and Rickleton got MICT off to a strong start, scoring 50 inside five overs. However, the loss of three quick wickets threatened to detail the MICT innings. It was at this point that Brevis, popularly known as 'Baby AB', stepped up and delivered the goods, helping MICT post 181. Brevis smashed 38 off 18 balls, in a knock comprising two fours and four sixes.""I had lot of things in my head. I won't forget the last season. It was tough. I wanted to focus on few things and give it my best,"" stated the South African batter. The bowlers further stepped in and rose to Rashid's rallying call, knocking out the opposition for 105 in 18.4 overs, in a stunning show of intent. Rabada was the pick of the bowlers, accounting for four wickets.""Throughout this season, we didn't play a selfish innings. Every player thought about what the team needs. This is the only franchise which has won every tournament. We have won the IPL, MLC, the ILT20 and now the SA20,"" said Rashid, whose relentless pursuit for a second trophy had finally come to an end. While the Afghanistan all-rounder wouldn't have imagined such an agonising wait, it finally arrived in the sweetest and grandest of ways.","Afghanistan all-rounder Rashid Khan lifted the IPL 2022 trophy.

Why Liverpool have been unstoppable in Premier League,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/epl/top-stories/why-liverpool-have-been-unstoppable-in-premier-league/articleshow/118544329.cms,"Seldom in recent years has the English Premier League title been all but sealed as early as February. But such has been Liverpool 's supremacy in a season where otherwise perennial winners Manchester City slipped into oblivion, and closest challengers Arsenal have endured untimely setbacks in the title race, that it looks good as done. Arne Slot's Liverpool, who made a thumping statement with the league double over defending champions City on Sunday, enjoy a 11-point cushion at the summit with about one-third of the season remaining. TOI analyses the key factors for the Reds' dominant run among Europe's elite leagues this term…Fitting in the Slot: While Kop favourite Jurgen Klopp established a base for future success and left behind a fine squad for Slot to inherit, the Dutchman has surprised the sceptics by seamlessly adapting to the English game. In his maiden EPL season, Slot has gone toe to toe with the best, thanks to his flexibility and tactical tweaks - the 'relocation' of Cody Gakpo for one. The Dutch international is relishing his current role on the left wing after being used primarily as a striker under Klopp. ""It felt a little bit like the 'old me'. I feel really good in this position,"" Gakpo, owner of eight EPL goals this season, said. On Sunday, Slot showed his tactical nous again, employing midfielders Curtis Jones and Dominik Szoboszlai up front in the absence of an out-and-out striker.Run like the Egyptian: Mohamed Salah has been enjoying an extraordinary season, forever raising an already high bar. With 25 goals and 16 assists in 27 appearances, the north African has been the league's most productive player by a distance. For perspective, Salah's closest rivals (Alexander Isak (Newcastle United) and Erling Haaland (City)) trail him by six goals in the standings. ""He gets the ball and does something special, that is sometimes difficult. But not many things seem difficult for Mo,"" Slot said of his 32-year-old spearhead. ""We need another title. Me and the big guys in the team, we need another title,"" Salah, whose current deal is set to expire at the end of the season, said.Ryan's gig: Ryan Gravenberch has proved indispensable to Slot's system, so much that even a slight dip in form has been overlooked. Forging a strong partnership with Alexis Mac Allister in the middle of the park, the Dutch midfielder has shone in his deep-lying defensive role. The 22-year-old has been handed a start in every EPL match thus far and Slot has used like-for-like replacement in Wataru Endo off the bench. ""When you come to Liverpool, you always want to be in the first XI,"" Gravenberch had said. ""When Slot told me that he sees me as a No. 6, I knew what I had to do. Of course, I have had to adapt a little bit, but it has been going really well,"" the youngster had added.Moderate means more: Where everyone simply splashes the cash, Liverpool did not spend big in the last two transfer windows. The only senior arrival was Italian forward Federico Chiesa. Yet, despite not possessing a luxurious squad depth, Slot has managed available resources admirably. Liverpool have reaped the rewards of their emphasis on injury prevention, hardly losing key players to long-term injuries - nine players have made 25 appearances or more so far this season. Training sessions not being as intense as they were during Klopp's era and Slot's ""patient"" and ""possession-based"" style have greatly helped in this regard.Virgil's vigil: Led by their talismanic centre-half Virgil van Dijk , Liverpool have the second-best defensive record in the league; they are behind Arsenal, having conceded 26 goals. The Reds are perched at the top of the 'clean sheets' table with 11 shutouts, despite not being at their best defensively in recent fixtures. ""Clean sheets are one of the reasons why you win a lot,"" is the Slot maxim.","Arne Slot's Liverpool are 11 points clear at the top of the EPL table. The Dutchman has impressed since taking over from Jurgen Klopp. Liverpool have the second-best defensive record in the league, having conceded 26 goals. Mohamed Salah has been the league's most productive player.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118544297,imgsize-75418,width-400,resizemode-4/118544297.jpg"

KOLKATA: On a night when India and Pakistan were busy playing out cricket's greatest rivalry in Dubai, the sight of hundreds of cars causing a traffic jam on EM Bypass in this part of the world was not normal.On a night when Indian club football's biggest prize was up for grabs and runaway leaders Mohun Bagan SG were at home, the sight of Jose Molina's team huffing and puffing for a goal in the regulation time, and that too in their formidable fortress, was not normal. Then, everything became normal, almost with a sense of inevitability, at the Salt Lake Stadium on Sunday.Dimitrios Petratos , coming off the bench late in the second half, received a ball from Manvir Singh, swivelled to transfer his striking power from right to left foot and took an aim towards the goal from the edge of the box. The ball flew past a jungle of feet before settling into the bottom left corner of Odisha FC goalkeeper Amrinder Singh's net.It was the third of the nine-minute stoppage time but good enough for Mohun Bagan to beat a 10-man Odisha FC 1-0 and become the first Indian club to defend the ISL Shield . Unlike last season when the team under Antonio Lopez Habas required a win over Mumbai City in the last match of the league stage to lay their hands on the Shield, Molina's side sealed the deal with two games in hand.Their 12th straight wins at home this term also took their tally to 52 points from 22 matches, breaking another new ground in the league and turning nearest rivals FC Goa's late push into insignificance now.Sergio Lobera's Odisha came here with a plan. They were happy to play second fiddle to Bagan's buccaneering pace and potency, defending in numbers and hoping to catch the hosts off guard with quick counter-offensives whenever such an opportunity presented itself. Their ploy appeared to pay off until the 83rd minute when Mourtada Fall was forced into a challenge from behind on a goal bound Jamie Maclaren inside the D and referee Harish Kundu flashed a straight red card to Odisha's Senegalese defender.It proved to be a game-changer.Molina went for an all-out attack, bringing on Jason Cummings in place of defender Tom Aldred. This forced Lobera to react, sacrificing his Piano player Hugo Boumous and bringing in his place more defender in Narender.The tall order for Odisha suddenly had become even taller. Petratos - who replaced Aldred in the 78th minute - then seized his moment, bringing purpose to the occasion, delving into his trademark stein gun celebration and sending even a hard-nosed Molina to break into a jig.In the presence of more than 50000 green-and-maroon spectators at the stadium, the lingering anticipation had been palpable even before the kickoff. Bagan dominated, first forcing Amrinder to come up with back-to-back saves denying Greg Stewart and Maclaren in the closing stages of the opening half and Manvir and Maclaren awfully squandering more chances from close after the break.Thus reprieved, Odisha, now with 29 points from 22 matches, hoped to stay on track for making the playoffs.Then the visitors suffered the game changing fall through the expulsion of Fall. Bagan suddenly sensed their chances and Petratos made the most of it, sending the stands into rapture.Odisha's defeat also meant that Jamshedpur have qualified for the playoffs.",Mohun Bagan become the first Indian club to defend the ISL Shield.

Especially when you are in the title race, it is incredible,"" said Salah after Liverpool's first league win at the Etihad for a decade.""Me and the big guys in the team, we need another title.""This was another heartbreaking loss for the deposed English champions, who are currently 20 points behind the top, only days after losing to Real Madrid in the Champions League Throughout Pep Guardiola 's illustrious leadership, Liverpool has frequently failed in the great rivalry of English football in recent years.However, in Arne Slot's first season as manager, it currently looks as though they will be able to break Manchester United 's record of 20 English top-flight titles in a matter of months.""We work every single day to achieve this and it is three months of very hard work (ahead) to maintain this,"" said Slot.""It is important to understand why we are where we are.""The pressure on Liverpool, which had increased after they lost two of their previous three games at Everton and Aston Villa, was reduced by Arsenal's shocking 1-0 home loss to West Ham on Saturday.The hardest test of all has traditionally been a trip to the Etihad, but City's defensive weaknesses were readily shown, and they also missed the injured Erling Haaland 's offensive presence.In contrast, Liverpool's star was healthy and playing well, as Salah increased his incredible season total to 25 goals and 16 assists in 27 Premier League games.The Egyptian's masterfully performed set-piece move put the visitors ahead in the 14th minute.Szoboszlai flicked Alexis Mac Allister's corner into Salah's path, and his shot ducked off Nathan Ake and beyond Ederson's dejected dive.Omar Marmoush had gone offside before Phil Foden brought him in, but City's own Egyptian international shown his ability to finish at the other end.Trent Alexander-Arnold was being skipped past by City winger Jeremy Doku at will, but the Belgian kept missing with a telling cross or strike.When he sprinted onto a long ball over the top and teed up Szoboszlai to wrong-foot Ederson, Salah was not so understanding.If Liverpool had been equally accurate on the counterattack after the half, the ultimate result may have been far more humiliating for City.A VAR review disallowed Curtis Jones' third goal for offside after Szoboszlai's run through the center of the City defense was just not timed.Only an incredible last-ditch tackle by Abdukodir Khusanov stopped Szoboszlai a second goal, and Ederson was forced into a spectacular save by Luis Diaz.In last weekend's 4-0 victory over Newcastle, Marmoush scored a hat-trick and continued to be a dangerous threat by putting another effort in front of Alisson Becker's goal.However, City didn't produce enough to reach the 70 percent possession mark.Despite suffering their eighth league loss of the year, Guardiola's team is still in fourth place and will be sure to qualify for the Champions League the next year, as a top-five finish is probably sufficient.However, City now looks like yesterday's club following an incredible run of four straight victories, with Liverpool emerging as the new champions.",Liverpool beat Manchester City 2-0 at the Etihad Stadium.

A costly error by Alba led to Martinez scoring NYCFC's second goal.Despite limited service to Messi and an underwhelming performance from Luis Suarez, who was later substituted, Miami persisted.

Shambolic defending

Liverpool, Feb 22, 2025 -Bruno Fernandes inspired a Manchester United rally from two goals down to avoid another damaging defeat for Ruben Amorim in a 2-2 draw at Everton on Saturday.United were headed for a ninth defeat in their last 13 league games as goals from Beto and Abdoulaye Doucoure put the Toffees 2-0 up inside 33 minutes.The visitors had not mustered a shot on target until Fernandes' free-kick pulled a goal back 18 minutes from time before Manuel Ugarte's equaliser salvaged a point for United.More late drama was to come as Everton were awarded a penalty deep into stoppage time, only for referee Andy Madley to overturn his decision after a VAR review.A point edges Everton up to 12th, while United remain in 15th.Everton were in a battle for survival when David Moyes returned for his second spell in charge last month, but they have taken 14 points from a possible 18 in their last six games to ensure their 71-year stay in the top flight will not come to an end.Amorim conceded before the game that Moyes, who himself was sacked after less than a season in charge of United in 2014, was doing a better job than he has managed since arriving from Sporting Lisbon in November.When the sides last met in Amorim's first home league game, United cruised to a 4-0 win at Old Trafford, but he has managed just three victories in 13 Premier League games since.Everton have just five more matches to come at Goodison Park before they move to a new 53,000-capacity stadium next season.The home fans and team are determined to make the most of what is left at the club's home since 1892 and put a United side lacking in confidence under pressure from the off.But when Everton did take the lead on 19 minutes it was thanks to comedic United defending.The Red Devils had multiple chances to deal with a corner into the box before the ball eventually broke for Beto to fire into the ground and over Andre Onana.The striker has been transformed since Moyes' return, scoring five times in his last four Premier League appearances after netting just four times in his first 44 for the club.Beto also had a big part to play in the second as his run in behind opened up the United defence before he fed Jack Harrison with a low cross.Onana could only parry Harrison's shot into the air and Doucoure outmuscled Harry Maguire to head in the loose ball.Doucoure was denied a second by a fine save from Onana as Everton looked to build on their lead early in the second half.But, not for the first time, Fernandes was United's one source of inspiration.The Portugal international's free-kick wrong-footed Jordan Pickford to kickstart the fightback.Another Fernandes free-kick was the source of the equaliser as this time Ugarte pounced on Beto's headed clearance to fire in his first goal for the club.Both sides had chances to win it in a thrilling finale.Beto planted a header from close range too close to Onana, while Pickford tipped over Fernandes' dipping effort from the edge of the box.United, though, were fortunate to escape in added time when Ashley Young looked to have been pulled down by a combination of Maguire and Matthijs de Ligt.The referee pointed to the spot but was instructed to take a second look and overturned his decision to save Amorim from further embarrassment.",Manchester United held to 2-2 draw by Everton at Old Trafford. Goals from Beto and Abdoulaye Doucoure put Toffees 2-0 up. Bruno Fernandes free-kick pulled United level 18 minutes from time.

PANAJI: On a flight from Goa to Mumbai last week, FC Goa coach Manolo Marquez had some advice for goalkeeper Lara Sharma .FC Goa were flying to Mumbai for their Indian Super League (ISL) clash and the goalkeeper and coach were seated next to each other. Manolo told Lara: ""You will arrive where your mind wants you to. You can be very good technically, tactically, physically, but if you are not strong enough here (in the mind), you won't make progress.""Lara needed to hear those words.On the sidelines for nine months with an ACL injury he picked up last season, Lara returned to the first team in December but soon realised he still had plenty of ground to cover with his fitness. Manolo also admitted he could have erred in rushing back the goalkeeper too soon, and it's only now that the 25-year-old has been part of the match-day squad for the last three games.Lara is yet to make an appearance for FC Goa, who he joined this season, but knows he must be ready whenever called into action.""I don't know when my chance will come, but whenever I get a chance (to play), I know I have to come up with good performance,"" Lara told TOI during the pre-match media interaction on Friday. ""It does not matter whether I get a chance tomorrow, after a month, two months or even next season. But whenever I play, I have to do well. I have to be patient.""It hasn't been an easy ride for Lara in the Indian Super League (ISL).Having graduated from the famed Tata Football Academy (TFA), Lara had stints with Indian Arrows, India juniors and ATK reserves, before moving to Bengaluru FC where he was second choice to India goalkeeper Gurpreet Singh. Nobody raised an eyebrow when he was loaned to Kerala Blasters due to lack of game time, but just when things were beginning to look up, he picked up an injury in the playoff against Odisha FC.The injury turned out to be serious. It was Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) which needed surgery and a lengthy spell out of action.""It was difficult for me because I never had injuries in my life from the day I start playing football. This was a big injury, it was really, really difficult, especially the first three-four months when I was at home. For pre-season (with Goa), there were senior players like Sandesh (Jhingan), Odei (Onaindia), Iker (Guarrotxena) who motivated me. It helped me during the rehab. It was a difficult period but taught me a lot,"" said Lara.Lara was meant to be first choice goalkeeper for Goa, until the injury disrupted plans.Laxmikant Kattimani was then signed from Hyderabad and the experienced keeper grabbed the top spot. Hrithik Tiwari was forced into action only when Kattimani was injured and since then the youngster has given a good account of himself.Lara knows his time will come.""The team is performing good, Hrithik is also playing well. It's been tough for me (on the sidelines). When I returned in December, I thought the injury was gone, I'm good, but on the pitch it was different. When I spoke with the coach, he told me I need more time (to make a comeback), so I started seeing videos of my training sessions every day. I noticed I had to improve on some things.""Then there were doubts too whether the injury will reoccur. Speaking with someone like Sandesh helps a lot. He's always positive (with his words). He's always motivating and told me injuries are part of a footballer's life. Recovery takes time, it's a process and I'll return to the field (for a competitive game),"" said Lara.",Lara Sharma is yet to make an appearance for FC Goa this season.

They also met in the 2013 Champions League group stage.The winner of the tie will progress to face either Lyon or FCSB in the quarter-finals. FCSB recently lost 2-0 at home to United in their final group phase match.Rangers will travel to Istanbul for their first leg against Fenerbahce. Mourinho has previous success in this competition, winning it with Manchester United in 2017 and the UEFA Cup with Porto in 2003.A Fenerbahce victory could set up a quarter-final clash between Mourinho and his former club Roma. However, Roma faces a challenging tie against Athletic Bilbao, who are eager to reach the final at their home stadium, San Mames, on May 21.Tottenham's tie begins with an away leg in the Netherlands against AZ, whom they previously defeated 1-0 in the group phase.The winner of the Tottenham-AZ tie could face another Dutch journey in the quarter-finals, meeting either Ajax or 2022 champions Eintracht Frankfurt.While Manchester United and Tottenham can only meet in the final, United could potentially face Mourinho's Fenerbahce or Rangers in the semi-finals.Greek side Olympiakos, last season's Conference League champions, will compete against Norwegian champions Bodo/Glimt. The victor will advance to face either group phase winners Lazio or Czech Republic's Viktoria Plzen in the quarter-finals.","Manchester United paired with Spanish side Real Sociedad.

Andreeva, the only teenager in the top-100 of the rankings, was relentless in her attitude and approach even if her tennis at times was weary.The Russian noted that confidence is easy to wear when things are going your way. ""The ball is flying, you hit a lot of winners,"" she said. ""The hardest part is to be positive, to be there (in the moment) 100 per cent mentally, when things are not going your way.""For much of her near two-hours on court against the in-form Tauson, the Russian tried but couldn't produce the tennis that saw her put out three Grand Slam champions - Marketa Vondrousova, Iga Swiatek and Elena Rybakina - in a week. ""I told myself, you can either let that negativity come into your head or you can choose to fight for every point,"" Andreeva said. ""I've been listening to a lot of LeBron James interviews. He said it's easy to be confident and to play good when everything goes your way. What makes you a champion is when you're giving your best when you don't feel great. That's what I tried to do in the final.""Andreeva's goal for the 2025 season was to break into the top-10, now that she has debuted in the top tier at No.9 this week, the teenager promptly raised the bar.""The higher your ranking is, the slower the climb (becomes) because the difference in the points is very little,"" she said. ""If I win another tournament, I'm going to be top-eight maybe. If I win another tournament, I can still be top eight. It's going to be hard to enter the Top-five. That is the goal I'm going to set for myself, to be Top-five by the end of the year.""When asked what she'd do with this week's earnings of $597,000, Andreeva shrugged. She felt she had everything she needed.""I don't know what I want, I feel like I have everything. I won the tournament. I've already reached the goal that I had set for myself for the end of the year,"" she said, adding, ""My family is traveling with me. I have a great team. I feel happy, and this is all I need.""A couple of minutes later she was asked if she likes to shop, Andreeva's face mirrored a light bulb.""Yes, of course I like shopping, it doesn't matter what I buy, just as long as I buy something, I already feel good. It can be jewelry, a pair of jeans, socks, cap… As long as I buy something, I feel like the day is successful,"" Andreeva said, noting that her father Alexander doesn't like to shop. ""I like to buy something, even something from the grocery store.""It's easy to forget Andreeva's age when she's on the tennis court, serving big and painting the lines with her groundstrokes. Just as well that she doesn't hold back when she's not aiming for the lines.","Mirra Andreeva is the youngest winner of a WTA 1000 title.

DUBAI: Alex de Minaur put it simply. In modern-day tennis, where power brings glory, the 26-year-old has had to 'adapt or die'.De Minaur, the second seed in the Dubai Duty Free tennis championships - a 500 Series event for the men which gets underway on Monday - is one of five men in the ATP's top25, who stands at 6 ft (183 cms), the shortest in the top-tier of the sport.The Aussie, ranked eighth in the world, broke into the top-10 for the first time last Jan, and has spent most of the last 14 months in that elite bracket.De Minaur, who opens against the 6-ft-6-in veteran Marin Cilic in the first round here, shares a 2-2 head-to-head record with the 36-year-old Croat. ""I'm looking forward to a tough first-round match - a veteran player with a lot of experience, very dangerous, especially on these types of courts. I'm expecting a battle,"" he said.De Minaur, who took Carlos Alcaraz the distance in the final at Rotterdam in early Feb, likes how he has started the year.""I'm happy, I have played some great tennis. I've lost to Jannik (Sinner), to Carlos (Alcaraz) and now I lost to Andrey (Rublev in Doha last week) after having a match point, the last one stings a little bit because I feel like I had my chances. It's all about putting myself in those situations, giving myself the opportunity.""De Minaur said, ""People are hitting the ball with a lot more force (today). You're losing a little bit of that variety that you had with the likes of Roger (Federer). It feels like everything's a lot more fast-paced, because of the tech, racquets, balls… Conditions are slower, everyone is hitting the ball so much harder.""Nice guy De Minaur, nicknamed 'Demon', found inspiration in where he finished last year, inside the top-10 and making the season-ending field in Turin.Mirra Andreeva became the youngest at 17 years to clinch a WTA 1000 title since its inception 16 years ago.

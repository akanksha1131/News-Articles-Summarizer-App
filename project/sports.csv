SALT ASSAULT

BENGALURU: After KL Rahul (93 not out; 53b; 7x4; 6x6) scored the winning runs for Delhi Capitals (DC) with a six, he sauntered to the adjoining pitch, drew a circle and thumped his bat on the ground. After all, the M Chinnaswamy Stadium is his home turf, and Rahul simply owned the stage on Thursday night.A flamboyant yet classic batter whose repertoire of strokes runs delightfully deep, Rahul in his backyard is a dangerous proposition, especially if he is dropped by the opposition even before he gets going, as Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) found out the hard way.Rahul, dropped by Rajat Patidar on five, turned match winner in Capitals’ six-wicket victory in a tricky chase of 164, ensuring DC cantered home with 13 balls to spare. Rahul oozed class and composure as he soaked in the pressure of losing early wickets to stitch together a match-winning 111-run (55 balls) fourth-wicket partnership with Tristan Stubbs (38; 23b; 4x4; 1x6).Defending a modest total, RCB’s bowlers were on the money in the first half of DC’s chase. The new-ball pair of Bhuvneshwar Kumar (2/26) and Yash Dayal had the crowd on their feet with their swing and testing lengths, sending back openers Faf du Plessis (2), Jake Fraser -McGurk (7) and Abhishek Porel inside the Powerplay.At 58/4 in the ninth over, the visitors had their backs to the wall. Even as the cloudy Bengaluru skies threatened to open up, Rahul stepped on the accelerator in the 15th over, picking the seasoned Josh Hazlewood for a display of delectable drives and magnificent cover drives, as the over yielded 22 runs.From there on, it was just a matter of formality as Rahul and Stubbs ensured a four-match winning streak for the Capitals.There was an aura of invincibility around Phil Salt. The only person who could have stopped the explosive opener was the Englishman himself. All it took was a stumble on the turnaround and a communication lapse and the momentum tilted in DC’s favour.RCB raced to 61 off 23 deliveries with Salt contributing 37 (17b; 4x4; 3x6). Just when it seemed like the combination of Salt and Virat Kohli (22) had set the tone for a run feast, Salt, after a failed bid for a cheeky single, stumbled and then scrambled to make his crease even as Rahul — that man again — hit the stumps.Salt’s dismissal snuffed the impetus as the RCB batting line-up mostly made guest appearances at the crease, crumbling around the lack of pace from spinners and poor shot selection. It took an unbeaten 20-ball 37 from Tim David to take RCB to 163/7, with 36 runs coming off the last two overs.Devdutt Padikkal’s stay at the crease was laboured and Mukesh Kumar ended it in quick time. The hosts ended the Powerplay with 64/2. The onus was on Kohli and skipper Rajat Patidar (25) to resuscitate the innings, but Capitals unleashed leggie Nigam to render the boisterous crowd speechless.Kohli, looking to drive, failed to control his shot and Starc rushed in from long-off to complete a brilliant catch. Axar Patel’s blend of spin and pace attack choked the RCB batters and ensured wickets at regular intervals. Kuldeep Yadav (2/17) and Nigam, with their googlies and flighted deliveries, were impressive",Delhi Capitals beat Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) by six wickets. KL Rahul (93 not out) and Tristan Stubbs (38) scored the winning runs. RCB were bowled out for 164 in their 20 overs.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120187682,imgsize-49838,width-400,resizemode-4/KLrahul.jpg"

Poll Do you believe that home advantage is significant in IPL matches? No, it doesn't matter Yes, it plays a crucial role

Bombay Sport Exchange Episode 1: Interview with Sanjog Gupta, CEO (Sports) at JioStar

Bombay Sport Exchange Ep. 2: GroupM's Vinit Karnik on IPL's growth and emerging sports

'Gill going to hold us in good stead'

Jos Buttler Exclusive Interview: I owe Jayawardene for letting me open in T20

Way forward

Sai Sudharsan Exclusive Interview: 'The dream is to play Test cricket'

In football, home advantage counts for a lot. The hosts are aware of the pitch, the stadium, and enjoy local support which plays a big part in swaying the referees and creating hostile environments for the visitors.In cricket, especially franchise cricket such as the Indian Premier League ( IPL ), that isn't necessarily the case. The teams can't dictate the make-up of the surface but the other tangibles remain the same: fans, understanding the conditions and the dimensions of the stadium. These are all aspects that the home teams are expected to know more than the visiting sides.Defending champions Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) were one of the teams that made the most of home conditions in their title run. They, alongside Chennai Super Kings (CSK), Delhi Capitals (DC) and Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH), won five home matches last season. Last year, as Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) reeled off six straight wins to qualify for the playoffs, three of them came at home.This season, plenty has been made of lack of home advantage. KKR skipper Ajinkya Rahane, Lucknow Super Giants mentor Zaheer Khan and CSK coach Stephen Fleming have been the loudest voices against curators not preparing surfaces suitable for the home teams. PBKS assistant bowling coach Trevor Gonsalves argued, ""there is no home advantage in the IPL.""When probed about the franchise vs curator debate, Gujarat Titans COO Colonel Arvinder Singh told TimesofIndia.com, ""Look, the rules and regulations on this are very clear and not just from this season. They've been clear right from the very beginning.""""The rules of the game are very clear and they are common for everybody. No franchise has any right to say, 'I want this kind of a pitch'. That's not something that the rules allow you to do.""""The home advantage has to stem from the fact that that is your home. You are supposed to know those conditions better than anybody else who's coming because that is where you play most of your games, where you practice. So from that perspective, if you're looking at a home advantage, well, why not? You deserve all the home advantage that you can take.""To say that I need home advantage because I want this kind of a pitch. Sorry, I don't think that cuts any ice with anybody,"" he added.The IPL Playing Conditions back Singh's argument. As per 'The Match' definitions, section 1.11 reads, ""Ground Authority is the entity responsible for the selection and preparation of the pitch and other functions relating to the hosting and management of the match, including any agents acting on their behalf (including but not limited to the curator or other ground staff).""For the record, the 2022 champions have made a promising start at their home venue in Narendra Modi Stadium, winning two of three played so far.Zoom out even further and GT have been stellar with the season 24 matches through. They've posted four wins out of five played, pocketed eight points, and sit top of the pile as things stand.With former IPL champions such as five-time winners CSK and MI struggling alongside SRH, KKR and RR, GT are the only former champions who haven't lost the plot in the 18th season.""I think it's still early days. By God's grace, yes we have done well thus far, but there's still a long way to go. It's a long drawn tournament. So we don't want to get ahead of ourselves and start thinking of the playoffs already. There's a long way to go and we need to win more games,"" said Col. Singh.""It's not easy to get to the top four and be there consistently. Some teams continue the same momentum throughout and some teams start early, but are not able to sustain that momentum. And then you suddenly find somebody coming through, like what happened with RCB last year.""So it's too early to discount anything and say that any former champion or even those who have not been champions are out of the race this early in the tournament,"" he added.In his opening season as GT captain last year, Shubman Gill had a challenging start. Having taken over from Hardik Pandya, GT finished eighth in IPL 2024. The decision to appoint Gill as captain raised eyebrows, especially considering the fact that he had led his state side Punjab in only two matches. To make matters worse for the top-order batter, runs dried up too.Early days in IPL 2025 but the team has looked promising with Sai Sudharsan, Jos Buttler, Sai Kishore, Mohammed Siraj and Prasidh Krishna all making an impact.Col. Singh feels vindicated with his, and the management's, choice of backing Gill when not many held that enthusiasm.""It is his coming of age now as a leader more than a captain. You can see it in his body language, the control, whether it's the strategy that he's adopting, whether he's reacting to situations on ground. It's amazing to see how young Shubman has developed into a leader of the pack and still being able to be one of the finest players as far as GT is concerned,"" said the franchise COO of Gill who has scored 148 runs in five innings this season at a strike rate of 146.53.""So it is amazing to see his growth. We have always said that at GT we like to do things from a longer-term perspective and not look at short-term solutions. So last time we were criticised a little bit to say that, you know, it's too early for him (to captain) and there were other options available. But you're always looking at it from a longer-term perspective, you know, and I think we can happily say that that decision was a good decision and it's going to hold us in good stead over a number of years going forward,"" he explained further.With an eye always on the long-term picture, GT plan on recalibrating after the season ends to devise a growth strategy, such as a potential Women's Premier League (WPL) team.Ahmedabad-based Torrent Group , a healthcare major, had acquired a majority 67 per cent stake in GT before the season began. While the specifics of the deal were not made official, the figure is expected to highlight the growth of the franchises and IPL by extension.As per reports, CVC had bought GT in 2021 for Rs 5,625 crore. For the majority acquisition, Torrent Group is believed to have spent Rs 5025 crore which takes GT's valuation at Rs 7500 crore.It is in keeping with the growth story of the IPL, which has grown faster than Gold and the Sensex since its inception in 2008.""When we started out in 2008, nobody knew how it was going to pan out. It took more than a couple of years for IPL to kind of realise its potential,"" said Col. Singh who has been part of Kings XI Punjab, Gujarat Lions and Gujarat Titans during his various IPL stints.""It was only after the fourth or fifth year, where it was a gradual growth all along. But after the fourth year, we realised that it is the quality of cricket that is going to define the longevity of the league. It is the quality of the cricket that happens on the ground, the quality of players and the type of cricket that is showcased therein which is going to draw in eyeballs.""At that point we realised it is something that, as Indians, we can be proud of. Today you see what it has grown into. In terms of growth, it is more than 10x (from) where it started off.""IPL has seen its ups and downs over the number of years. But if you look at a sporting property in 17 years where nothing like this had ever happened in our country. From what it was and what it is today, I think it is something that all of us can be pretty proud of,"" he concluded.","Gujarat Titans COO Colonel Arvinder Singh says there is no home advantage in the IPL. The 2022 champions have made a promising start at their home venue in Narendra Modi Stadium, winning two of three played so far. Last year, as Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) reeled off six straight wins to qualify for the playoffs, three of them came at home.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120186948,imgsize-37658,width-400,resizemode-4/Gujarat-Titans-COO-Colonel-Arvinder-Singh.jpg"

Excerpts from an interview...

Opener or No. 3, which position suits you better?

There are so many contenders for that slot in the Indian team. How does the intense competition make you feel?

Which batter or left-hander have you fashioned your game on?

You are the fastest Indian to 1000

runs. Next target?

You were bought for Rs 20 lakh in 2022 and retained before this IPL for Rs 8.5 cr. That’s a quantum leap. Does that motivate or unnerve you?

You played for Surrey in 2023. Are you looking at a county contract this year too?

How has it been playing alongside former England captain Jos Buttler?

MUMBAI: IPL 2025 is turning into a happy hunting ground for Tamil Nadu opener Sai Sudharsan . He is the second-highest run-getter of the season so far, with only Lucknow Super Giants’ Nicholas Pooran ahead of him.Anybody would love to open the innings in T20s. You have a little bit more time. I’m enjoying opening in this format.India has great talent and there are quality openers and top-order batters. I focus on myself and try to improve so I can be a better batter. Whenever I get an opportunity to play for the country, I should be equipped for that.I’ve been watching a lot of Murali Vijay (former India & Tamil Nadu opener) videos. I love the way he moved at the crease and the way he batted.The record for most runs in the IPL, I’d love to have that. But right now, it’s all about taking baby steps and going for wins.That’s a good question. I look at it differently. Now I’m in a different price bracket. It gives me more freedom because there is no fear or restriction from my point of view. It’s all about cricket from now on. It’s all about exploring and giving my best rather than thinking about what I will do to earn money.I’d love to play a few more county games. A county stint will definitely have a big impact on my batting. I was exposed to a lot of difficult fast bowling and swinging conditions when I played for Surrey.It’s been exciting. The experience and knowledge that he brings reassures me out there. I get to learn a lot from him.","Sai Sudharsan is the second-highest run-getter of the season so far. Tamil Nadu opener is the fastest Indian to 1000 runs in the IPL. He is looking at a county contract this year too, he says.

BENGALURU: Coming in at No. 6 in the 16th over against Mumbai Indians on Monday, Jitesh Sharma got going against Trent Boult following up a boundary with a maximum. In fact, the Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) wicketkeeper-bat scored 24 off eight Boult deliveries. He even picked up a loose ball from Jasprit Bumrah to send it into the long-on stands during his unbeaten 19-ball 40.Sharma’s repertoire of shots garnered a lot of attention. A utility player of high value, Sharma, who was roped in by RCB for Rs 11 crore this season, came into his own with the Punjab Kings in 2022. At RCB, Dinesh Karthik has taken the 31-year-old under his wings and the result — from one finisher to another — is telling.Sharma, a like-to-like replacement to Karthik — who hung up his boots after last season — worked extensively with the now RCB batting coach during the off-season. On the eve of RCB’s home game against Delhi Capitals, Sharma spoke about Karthik’s role in reshaping his game.“It’s been a great journey till now. During the off-season I worked hard with him (Karthik). The shots I am playing right now are a replica of what he used to play. He is trying to turn me into a new player because he believes that I can play all around the circle.”After an underwhelming 2024 season, Sharma emphasised on the mental blocks he has been able to clear.“Last year’s performance was because of mental issues. I was not mentally in the game because I was thinking ahead and about the future. When I met Dinesh bhai, he told me that it’s a human error. It’s not rocket science; it happens to everyone,” he explained.Having sorted his mental demons, Sharma also revealed that confidence building is a part of his training regime.“My confidence doesn’t rely on the score. It always depends on my process and how I train. It’s because, if I have confidence in the end result, then the variables go up and down. So, I mostly keep my confidence high during practice,” he added.",Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) wicketkeeper-bat scored 24 off eight Boult deliveries.

The Royals batter instantly opted for a DRS review. Replays showed a spike on UltraEdge as the ball passed the bat, prompting the third umpire to uphold the on-field decision.However, Parag was visibly dissatisfied, seemingly convinced the spike came from his bat grazing the ground rather than an edge.

Poll Who do you think will hit more sixes in IPL 2025? Rohit Sharma Virat Kohli

Two icons of Indian cricket, Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma, are not just competing for team glory in the IPL, but they're also locked in a captivating duel of sixes. This battle of legends is turning into a spectacle, reminding everyone of their enduring power and prowess.Virat Kohli is just four sixes away from equaling Rohit Sharma's career IPL total.Currently, Rohit Sharma holds second place on the all-time list with 282 sixes in 256 innings. He is closely followed by Virat Kohli, who has hit 278 sixes in 248 innings.Chris Gayle, who retired four years ago, leads the chart. His IPL six-hitting numbers are staggering. With 357 sixes in 141 innings, he remains the undisputed leader. His single-season record of 59 sixes in 2013, after hitting 51 in 2012, further underlines his dominance. Remarkably, 127 of those sixes were struck at Bengaluru's M. Chinnaswamy Stadium.Virat Kohli is the highest run-scorer in IPL history, with 8168 runs from 256 matches, including eight centuries, the most by any batter.On Monday, Virat Kohli completed 13,000 runs in T20 cricket, becoming only the fifth player and the first Indian to achieve this milestone. He reached this landmark during his team's IPL match against Mumbai Indians at Wankhede Stadium.So far in IPL 2025, Virat has scored 164 runs in four matches at an average of 54.66 and a strike rate of over 143, with two half-centuries and a highest score of 67. He is the sixth-highest run-scorer in the tournament to date. Kohli also scored one of his fastest IPL fifties against MI at Wankhede Stadium on Monday.Meanwhile, Rohit Sharma has struggled to find form in this year's IPL.

Sai Sudharsan Exclusive Interview: 'The dream is to play Test cricket'

During the IPL 2025 clash between Punjab Kings and Chennai Super Kings on Tuesday, CSK made a tactical decision to retire out opener Devon Conway Also See: RR vs GT Live Score, IPL 2025 Batting on 69 off 49 balls, Conway left the crease in the 18th over, replaced by Ravindra Jadeja , with CSK needing 49 runs from 13 balls to chase down a 220-run target. The decision was tactical — not injury-related — but CSK fell short, losing by 18 runs.This was the second instance this IPL season of a player being retired out, following Mumbai Indians' use of the same move with Tilak Varma against Lucknow Super Giants . So, what exactly does retired out mean, and how is it different from the more common term retired hurt ?In cricket, a batter who leaves the field due to injury or illness is deemed retired hurt (also known as retired – not out). Crucially, they can return later in the innings — if fit and if their team hasn't lost all its wickets. Statistically, they are not considered out, and their innings continues if they return.In contrast, the retired out is a strategic decision. The batter voluntarily leaves the field — not because of injury — and cannot return to bat again. It's essentially a self-declared dismissal, used to bring in a new batter who may better suit the match situation.While rare, these tactical moves are now gaining attention, adding a new layer to T20 strategy and forcing fans and broadcasters to rethink the term “retired.”","CSK made a tactical decision to retire out opener Devon Conway.

IPL 2025

, Bengaluru weather prediction

Rajat Patidar-led Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) will lock horns against Axar Patel's Delhi Capitals (DC) in Match No 24 of the Indian Premier League (IPL) at the M Chinnaswamy Stadium in Bengaluru. With three wins in as many games, DC are currently placed at the second place, while RCB are at the third position on the points table.RCB have mastered conditions as distinct as Kolkata, Chennai and Mumbai and their lone stumble came at home against Gujarat Titans. It was more to do with a rather out of character Chinnaswamy pitch taking them by surprise than any sudden erosion in skills.Royal Challengers Bangalore's in-form captain, Rajat Patidar , is expected to be a key player, particularly against spin. Delhi Capitals, therefore, will be looking to their left-arm spinner, Axar Patel, for a significant contribution. However, Patel has had a quiet start to the season, bowling only eight overs in three matches and failing to secure a wicket.The fitness of Faf du Plessis will be a key factor for Delhi Capitals, after he missed the game against CSK. If he is fit to open with Rahul, RCB's new ball bowlers will have to be on their game from ball one.The M. Chinnaswamy Stadium in Bengaluru is known for its characteristics that often lead to high-scoring T20 cricket matches. The pitch often provides good bounce and carry, which can assist fast bowlers, especially in the early overs. Dew can play a significant role in evening matches, making the ball slippery and challenging for bowlers.Virat Kohli, Phil Salt, Devdutt Padikkal , Rajat Patidar (c), Liam Livingstone, Jitesh Sharma (wk), Tim David, Krunal Pandya, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Josh Hazlewood, Yash Dayal,Rasikh SalamFaf du Plessis, Jake Fraser McGurk, Abishek Porel, KL Rahul (wk), Tristan Stubbs, Axar Patel (c), Vipraj Nigam, Mitchell Starc, Kuldeep Yadav, Mukesh Kumar, Mohit SharmaAshutosh SharmaRajat Patidar (c), Phil Salt, Virat Kohli, Devdutt Padikkal, Liam Livingstone, Jitesh Sharma (wk), Tim David, Krunal Pandya, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Josh Hazlewood, Yash Dayal, Suyash Sharma, Rasikh Dar Salam, Manoj Bhandage, Jacob Bethell, Swapnil Singh, Abhinandan Singh, Romario Shepherd, Lungi Ngidi, Nuwan Thushara, Mohit Rathee, Swastik Chikara.Axar Patel (c), Jake Fraser-McGurk, Faf du Plessis, Abishek Porel(w), Sameer Rizvi, Tristan Stubbs, Ashutosh Sharma, Vipraj Nigam, Mitchell Starc, Kuldeep Yadav, Mohit Sharma, Mukesh Kumar, Karun Nair, Donovan Ferreira, Tripurana Vijay, Darshan Nalkande, Dushmantha Chameera, KL Rahul, T Natarajan, Ajay Jadav Mandal, Manvanth Kumar L, Madhav Tiwari.311911The weather is expected to be partly to mostly cloudy during the match.

PSL owners' disputes

Jos Buttler Exclusive Interview: I owe Jayawardene for letting me open in T20

Decline of PSL

Bombay Sport Exchange Episode 1: Interview with Sanjog Gupta, CEO (Sports) at JioStar

Rashid Latif has stated that there is no comparison between the Indian Premier League (IPL) and the Pakistan Super League (PSL), as the former is considered the top league in cricket, while the latter is not even among the top five. The former Pakistan captain believes that the exclusion of Pakistani players from the IPL has hindered their development."" IPL vs PSL - There is no comparison,"" he told TimesofIndia.com from Islamabad.Rashid Latif, who played 37 Tests and 166 ODIs for Pakistan, highlighted the progress of Afghanistan and New Zealand cricketers, attributing their success to their participation in the IPL.""Afghanistan cricket has reached this level because of the IPL. They have worked hard on their grassroots, but playing in the IPL has given them crucial exposure. The same applies to New Zealand cricket. Look at their depth; many of their key players were in the IPL, and their second-string team defeated our full-strength Pakistan side in the ODIs,"" said the former Pakistan skipper.""Pakistan cricketers are not evolving. If they had played in the IPL, their game might have improved.""""Currently, they are playing against Bangladesh, West Indies, and Ireland. With no disrespect to these teams, they consistently lose miserably against stronger opponents.""In the past year, Pakistan has suffered embarrassing losses to Ireland and the USA, resulting in a dramatic group-stage exit from the T20 World Cup, endured a 2-0 home whitewash by Bangladesh, finished at the bottom of the World Test Championship (WTC) table, and were eliminated from the home Champions Trophy in the group stage.Earlier this week, Karachi Kings owner Salman Iqbal criticised Multan Sultans' counterpart Ali Tareen, who had accused the PCB of failing to deliver on promises of a ""bigger and better"" PSL.""How is PSL 10 bigger and better? Someone explain to me. When we say these hollow words that this is going to be the best PSL, what does that even mean? How will it be the best PSL? It’s the same games, same teams,"" Ali Tareen stated on a Cricwick podcast.Responding to Tareen’s comments, Salman Iqbal, owner of Karachi Kings, said, ""Since the start of PSL, many doubted us, critics from India and even some local tv channels. But what truly hurts is when one of our own, a team owner, chooses to publicly ridicule and disrespect this league despite its continuous growth.""Rashid Latif suggested that the PCB has a role to play in this infighting among the PSL owners.""This is the last PSL under the current franchise agreements. New bids will be held, and two new teams will join PSL 11. The current team owners want to devalue the PSL to acquire it at a lower cost. They want to reclaim their teams cheaply. This is a possibility.""The PCB also desires this. They don't want to damage the PSL's market because the owners and the authority are aligned.""Latif also pointed out the reasons for the PSL's decline. ""In the last two years, the PSL's graph has declined - both in quality and financially.""The PSL's first four years were excellent. The cricket was good. Top players participated, and the production and broadcasting were of high quality.""The downward trend began from the fifth season, possibly due to instability within the PCB, with numerous PSL directors being replaced. Many of those appointed were unprofessional. To date, no cricketer has been given the authority to manage the PSL.""In their draft – platinum, diamond, gold, silver, and emerging – there has been no increase in player remuneration. This was a significant error. They should have increased the pay, as all franchises are generating substantial revenue.""The resurgence of the Bangladesh Premier League (BPL) and the Lankan league, along with the emergence of SA20, MLC, and ILT20, has also negatively impacted us. The PSL was once the second-best league globally but has now dropped to sixth or seventh. There was no contingency plan. The PCB failed to capitalise on the PSL's potential as a product.""Take the IPL as an example. Despite its challenges, it has consistently grown larger and more successful. This is primarily due to professional management. The PSL has regressed into a local tournament. It could have achieved greater heights, but its potential has been squandered.""The 10th edition of the PSL will commence on Friday with a fixture between Islamabad United and Lahore Qalandars in Rawalpindi.","Rashid Latif says there is no comparison between the Indian Premier League (IPL) and the Pakistan Super League (PSL) The former is considered the top league in cricket, while the latter is not even among the top five. The former Pakistan captain believes that the exclusion of Pakistani players from the IPL has hindered their development.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120185860,imgsize-185078,width-400,resizemode-4/PSL.jpg"
"Captain Pant inspires LSG to embrace indomitable attitude, secure key wins",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/ipl/captain-pant-inspires-lsg-to-embrace-indomitable-attitude-secure-key-wins/articleshow/120164813.cms,"Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) have cruised to wins in three out of their five Indian Premier League (IPL) 2025 games so far, as they are placed fifth in the points table with six points.At the forefront of marshalling a largely inexperienced, and an all-Indian bowling unit has been Rishabh Pant , whose captaincy has come to the forefront with LSG emerging triumphant in some close finishes off late.While his batting in the middle has been uninspiring, Pant has made heads turn with his calm head behind the stumps, effectively guiding rookie leg-spinner Digvesh Rathi and his out-of-form counterpart Ravi Bishnoi. Rathi, who hails from Delhi and replicates Sunil Narine’s bowling action, has been a breakout star on the back of seven wickets in five encounters at an economy rate of 7.75. Pant has been often heard easing pressure off his state mate on the stump mic, asking him to focus on his line and lengths, leaving the field placements to the skipper.“Forget about his batting. Pant has justified his Rs 27 crore price tag merely with his captaincy here,” seasoned broadcaster and former India opener Navjot Singh Sidhu said, as LSG went about storming a phenomenal comeback to clinch a narrow four-run win against the Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) on Tuesday.“Pant has done the work worth Rs 50 crore here. He’s a true leader to have inspired LSG to a victory here. He led from the front, showed his men the direction, and swayed the momentum of the game back in their favour after a minor blip,” Sidhu had added.Going in with a foreigner-heavy batting lineup, LSG have had to make adjustments on the bowling front, going in with pacers such as Shardul Thakur, Akashdeep Singh, and Avesh Khan, with frontline speedster Mayank Yadav still out owing to injury.In such circumstances, Pant’s leadership has been a standout factor. He has taken brave calls, bringing Shardul Thakur into the attack in the 13th over to stop an onrushing Ajinkya Rahane. Thakur started sluggishly, bowling five consecutive wides, but eventually trapped the KKR skipper at short covers owing to a smart placing of the man there by their captain.""He might not be scoring runs, but he's worth his weight in Gold as a captain,” said Sunil Gavaskar on commentary, as the southpaw led his team to a 12-run win against LSG earlier this month.While Pant’s swashbuckling skills have never been under doubt, so far, he has managed to make a mark on the leadership front too. “10-15 years down the line, people will speak of Rishabh in the same breath as MS Dhoni and Rohit Sharma while discussing the best IPL captains,” co-owner Sanjeev Goenka had said in January.Pant seems to be working steadfastly in that regard so far.",Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) have won three out of their five Indian Premier League (IPL) games so far. LSG are placed fifth in the points table with six points. Rishabh Pant has been at the forefront of marshalling an all-Indian bowling unit.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120164802,imgsize-91482,width-400,resizemode-4/LSG-team-1004-sds.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Royal Challengers Bengaluru ( RCB ) star Jitesh Sharma credited former Australian legend Adam Gilchrist for his inclination towards wicketkeeping.In a video posted by IPL on their social media platform, the 31-year-old wicketkeeper-batter explained the importance of a strong technique with the gloves, including proper squatting and foot positioning.Jitesh also admitted that he focuses on keeping his shoulder and knee aligned like a box, ensuring that his body is always in a defensive position.""I think this love for wicketkeeping is because of Adam Gilchrist. The way he used to keep the ball so easily, the way he used to catch the ball, I was very inspired by that. In wicket keeping, there are some basics like Squat position and ball of the feet. These are some thumb rules,"" Jitesh Sharma said, as quoted by ANI.""But for me, I always try that my shoulder and my knee should be like a box. Whenever I move, I should move like a box. If my head is near the ball, automatically my body will be behind it. So, my second line of defence will be active. I should be close to it. Like I am throwing the ball far away. So, I should go like this and catch the ball rather than like this.""Also See: DC vs RCB Initially bought by the Mumbai Indians in the IPL 2016 auction, Jitesh was then retained in 2017.However, he didn't get a chance to play in a single match.He was once again purchased in the IPL 2022 by Punjab Kings , where he made his name as a destructive finisher.Jitesh scored 234 runs at a strike rate of 163.64 in IPL 2022 and continued with a remarkable season in 2023, scoring 309 runs at a strike rate of 156.06.As a lower middle-order batter, his small match-winning performances during IPL earned him his T20I debut against Nepal in October at the Hangzhou Asian Games.Ahead of IPL 2025 , RCB bought him for Rs 11 crore.In four matches so far, he has aggregated 85 runs with an average of 42.50 and a strike rate of 184.RCB will take on Delhi Capitals in the 24th match of the IPL 2025 on Thursday at the M Chinnaswamy Stadium, Bengaluru.",Royal Challengers Bengaluru ( RCB ) star Jitesh Sharma credited former Australian legend Adam Gilchrist for his inclination towards wicketkeeping.

Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) conceded first but rallied brilliantly to force three goals in their 3-1 win over Aston Villa at home in the first leg of their Champions League quarterfinal at the Parc des Princes stadium.Following their triumph over Liverpool in the round of 16, Luis Enrique's squad now finds themselves well-positioned to advance to the semifinals for the second consecutive season.Villa, on the other hand, now face an uphill task to reach their first semifinal since their triumphant campaign in 1982 as they need to put up an exceptional performance in the return leg.Morgan Rogers put Villa ahead in the 35th minute, but PSG swiftly equalised through an impressive finish from Desire Doue. Khvicha Kvaratskhelia then became the focal point with his brilliant strike at 49 minutes, followed by Nuno Mendes securing a vital third goal in added time, providing PSG with a considerable advantage before the return fixture in Birmingham next Tuesday.Enrique, currently pursuing PSG's maiden Champions League title, managed without his captain Marquinhos due to suspension and opted to start without Bradley Barcola for the first time in this season's European fixtures.Doue and Kvaratskhelia joined forces with top scorer Ousmane Dembele to form the home team's attacking line-up.Villa entered the match with an impressive streak of seven consecutive victories across all competitions, while Marco Asensio, currently on loan from PSG, began on the bench against his primary employers.The away side adopted a defensive stance, with the first-half action concentrated in their territory. Dembele initiated proceedings with a fierce shot that required Argentine goalkeeper and World Cup winner Emiliano Martinez to tip over the crossbar.Nevertheless, Villa managed to secure an unexpected lead in the 35th minute through Rogers, contrary to the flow of play.PSG responded swiftly, as Martinez nearly conceded when fumbling Doue's shot, before the equaliser was scored from the ensuing corner. The home side manoeuvred the ball across the pitch to Doue, who advanced towards the box and executed a precise curling shot past Martinez into the distant corner.This brilliant display from the 19-year-old French international was surpassed by Kvaratskhelia's effort, as the Georgian footballer put PSG in front shortly after the interval.Emery substituted Cash at the break, following the defender's yellow card for a challenge on Kvaratskhelia.Disasi was brought on as a substitute but struggled to contain Kvaratskhelia, who received a pass from Fabian Ruiz on the left flank and moved into the penalty area. The ex-Napoli player outmanoeuvred Disasi with skilful ball control before unleashing a powerful shot that struck the near post and went past Martinez into the net.In stoppage time, Dembele set up Mendes, who went around Martinez to score PSG's third and decisive goal.","Paris Saint-Germain defeated Aston Villa 3-1 in the first leg of their Champions League quarterfinal at the Parc des Princes.

Barcelona got a foot inside the semifinals of the Champions League after their commanding 4-0 victory over Borussia Dortmund in the quarterfinal first leg on Wednesday.The Barca dominance was led by Robert Lewandowski 's double strike, which has put the Spanish giants on the verge of their first semifinal appearance in the tournament since 2019The victory also extended Barca's unbeaten run to 23 matches.The five-time champions initiated the scoring through the in-form Raphinha, before Lewandowski reached his remarkable 40-goal milestone for the season with two clinical finishes.Young sensation Lamine Yamal showcased an exceptional performance throughout the match, skilfully adding Barcelona's fourth goal as Dortmund struggled to contain the onslaught.Barcelona, whose last Champions League triumph came in 2015, will travel to Germany next Tuesday, aiming to secure a semi-final place against either Inter Milan or Bayern Munich.Barcelona, the current leaders of La Liga, dominated early and broke the deadlock after 25 minutes. A precise free-kick from Lopez found Inigo Martinez at the far post, who directed it to Pau Cubarsi, setting up a goal-bound attempt. Raphinha, the competition's leading marksman, ensured the ball crossed the line by sliding in to claim his 12th goal, though Cubarsi's initial shot was already destined for the net.The Brazilian winger waited anxiously as VAR officials verified he was not offside.Before half-time, Serhou Guirassy missed two clear opportunities to equalise for the away side.Niko Kovac's Dortmund faced consequences for Guirassy's missed opportunities when Lewandowski scored his 10th goal of the tournament in the early stages of the second half.Three minutes after the break, Yamal delivered a cross to Raphinha, who directed a header towards Lewandowski at the far post, allowing him to score from close range beneath the crossbar.Barcelona continued their pursuit of a decisive third goal, with Lopez hitting the post and narrowly missing the target. The breakthrough arrived in the 66th minute when Lopez assisted Lewandowski, who found the net with a powerful shot at the near post.The former Dortmund forward's strike marked his 29th goal in 28 matches against his previous club, while also bringing his Barcelona tally to 99 since his arrival in 2022.Yamal, who consistently troubled Dortmund's defence throughout the match, rightfully scored after the visitors left significant gaps, allowing Raphinha to set him up for a clear shot on goal.The sole concern for Barcelona emerged when Yamal requested a substitution near the end, though he appeared cheerful while receiving applause from the crowd.Barcelona's pursuit of four trophies this season appears promising, given their impressive display in this match.",Barcelona beat Borussia Dortmund 4-0 in Champions League quarterfinal first leg.

Thomas Mueller equalised for Bayern in the 85th minute before Frattesi's late winner.Bayern, dealing with multiple injuries, dominated the early stages with Michael Olise and Harry Kane creating several chances in the first half-hour.The German side's injury crisis particularly affected their defense, with only Eric Dier and Kim Min-jae available as center-backs.

Arsenal secured a commanding 3-0 victory over Real Madrid in their Champions League quarter-final first leg at the Emirates Stadium on Tuesday. Declan Rice scored two stunning free-kicks in the second half, while Mikel Merino added a third goal before Real's Eduardo Camavinga was sent off late in the game.Rice's performance was particularly remarkable as he had never scored a free-kick in his career before this match. His two strikes left even Real Madrid's goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois unable to respond.The win puts Arsenal in a strong position ahead of the second leg at the Bernabeu on April 16. The winner will face either Paris Saint-Germain or Aston Villa in the semi-finals.Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta had described this match as the ""biggest night"" of his career, urging his players to make history by pursuing Arsenal's first Champions League title.The Gunners, who currently trail Premier League leaders Liverpool by 11 points, haven't reached the Champions League semi-finals since 2009. Their only final appearance ended in defeat to Barcelona in 2006.Real Madrid's defeat exposed their vulnerabilities, having already lost 10 times this season. They currently sit four points behind Barcelona in La Liga.The match began with Real Madrid showing early promise.

But Halder also committed blunders allowing Bagan the necessary routes to turn things around.First, Halder handled Tom Aldred’s header off a Cummings corner. Cummings made no mistake from the resultant penalty. Then, Apuia provided the proverbial coup de grâce, after Halder gave the ball away to Anirudh Thapa who laid it in the Mizo’s path.",Mohun Bagan SG are alive with their dream of an Indian Super League ( ISL ) ‘double’ A penalty by Jason Cummings (51) and a banger from Lalengmawia Ralte ‘Apuia’ (90+4) helped Jose Molina’s League Shield winners subdue a doggedly defensive Jamshedpur FC 2-0.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120083779,imgsize-68342,width-400,resizemode-4/Mohun-Bagan.jpg"

Bombay Sport Exchange Ep. 2: GroupM's Vinit Karnik on IPL's growth and emerging sports

Mumbai: He may have only been at the Santiago Bernabeu for a season, but it was enough for Michael Owen to understand the weight of wearing the Real Madrid jersey. And when you join one of the most decorated football clubs in the world, comparisons with its past greats are inevitable, Owen says.That’s the moment Madrid’s superstar summer signing Kylian Mbappe is currently living. Having equalled his idol Cristiano Ronaldo ’s tally of 33 goals in his first season with the Madrid giants, the France captain has got his coach Carlo Ancelotti wishing Mbappe can go on to match the Portuguese great’s towering accomplishments at the club.“The thing with Real Madrid, of course, is everybody compares you to greats of the past and you almost have to win virtually every trophy just to keep up with the demand and the expectation,” Owen said ahead of the ‘Legends Faceoff’ fixture in Mumbai on Sunday.“(With) Real Madrid winning the league, winning Champions Leagues in recent years, if Mbappe then turns up and they don’t have a good season, everybody blames him. That is an incredible pressure because they were winning before. I’m sure they will continue to be successful as well, but I think he’s done very well.“He is one of the most destructive players on the planet. He’s quick, he’s got great touch, he can score great goals, so I always thought it was going to be a great signing.”The former England international also analysed how football has evolved over the years, particularly the role of the number 9.“Everybody had two strikers when I played professional football. Now hardly anybody does. Somebody like myself, I guess I don’t know where I would fit in in today’s game. Maybe I’d have to play in one of the wider areas, I don’t know. The profile of the striker has definitely changed,” Owen said.Many pundits and former players attribute this change to Pep Guardiola, whose breathtaking Barcelona team from 2008–2012 soon became a template which teams across Europe couldn’t resist copying. Owen joined the chorus who feel it has turned football into a monotonous watch.“Yeah, I do agree. Everybody sees a great manager and their success and feels as if they have to copy that. And certain players, certain teams are not really capable in many ways of it, yet they still play that way and give away goals. It doesn’t suit all players,” he said, also expressing concern over the decreasing number of footballing ‘geniuses’.“It’s a much more athletic game now. It’s as important to be a good runner than it is to have skill which was never ever the case. Those old maverick players, just genius types of players, they’re slowly disappearing from our game and now it’s about hard, fast stats and running stats. So it is changing but it’s fascinating and it will continue to change again.”A technically gifted striker with a great eye for goal during his prime, Owen, now 45, scored 16 goals from 45 games in the famous Los Blancos shirt, including one in a 4-2 El Clasico win against Barcelona at the Bernabeu.“I was fortunate that I played in virtually all of the big derbies in England, but I don’t think anything compares to El Clasico. As a one-off game. I think it’s the biggest.“Scoring and playing in front of your own crowds and winning a big game was probably my biggest and best memory of playing for Real Madrid,” said Owen who had the opportunity to relive those memories as he featured for the Real Madrid Legends side at DY Patil Stadium.",Michael Owen believes Real Madrid's Kylian Mbappe is one of the most destructive players on the planet.

When will CSK legend MS Dhoni retire from IPL? Astrologer Greenstone Lobo predicts

Chennai: For over a decade now, Manchester United have been a shadow of the indomitable force that they were under serial winner Alex Ferguson.The trophy cabinet has had to be opened only a few times since Ferguson’s departure in 2013 and United have constantly been playing catch-up in England. One player who saw the English Premier League outfit reach multiple troughs during his 12-year stint (2011 to 2023) was defender Phil Jones . The former England international crisply summed up how United’s stocks have fallen drastically over the years, saying that mid-table teams and relegation battlers in the EPL are no longer frightened when making the trip to the iconic Old Trafford .“Around 2011, when we were in the tunnel before playing matches against lower-ranked teams, we had won even before we walked out onto the pitch. They (opponents) were petrified playing at Old Trafford, you could see the fear in them. We have sort of lost that and that is where we need to get back to,” said Jones, who was in Chennai for the final of the third edition of Apollo Tyres ‘Road to Old Trafford’, a five-a-side tournament supported by United.While Jones acknowledged that there is heaps of work to be done for United to get back to the upper echelons, he backed manager Ruben Amorim to guide them to great heights. “Amorim should be given a long run. He has been brought in for the right reasons, to improve United. I love how honest and open he is. You can understand where he is coming from, he is not hiding anything. I really like that side of him,” Jones said of the Portuguese.“It is going to be difficult for Amorim. He loves to play a different style and brand of football to the formation that we are used to, so we need to prepare to go through (this journey). We have to be patient and believe in what he is building,” added Jones.The two-time World Cupper is expecting United, stuttering in the league this term, to turn the tide next season. “There is still a great chance to qualify for the Champions League (by winning the Europa League). We could see success this season but hopefully, we see the best of United next season. There are a lot of young players in the team, there are a lot of players who are suffering from lack of confidence. Confidence is a huge thing in any sport. Slowly but surely, Amorim will build leaders who will bring that winning mentality,” Jones said.","Manchester United have been a shadow of the force that they were under Alex Ferguson.

Formula E is now in its 11th season since its debut in 2014, and the electric motorsport has achieved impressive success, carving its own identity despite the dominance of Formula 1. One of the key indicators of this success is the growing grid of 11 teams and 22 drivers—one more than the 10 teams in F1. While drivers like Oliver Rowland and Pascal Wehrlein have previously tested their skills in F1, it seems they've found their true calling in the more sustainable and rapidly evolving Formula E.Oliver Rowland is currently leading the Formula E standings with 68 points, thanks to his victory at this season’s Mexico City E-Prix. Rowland had a brief stint with F1 team Williams in 2018 before transitioning to Formula E, where he raced for Mahindra Racing and then Nissan, ultimately making a name for himself with the Japanese team. Antonio Felix da Costa, driving for Porsche, is also a formidable force in the series. He currently sits in third place with 39 points this season, continuing to prove his prowess on the track.Maximilian Günther has made a strong impression after his move from Maserati MSG Racing to DS Penske. At the Jeddah E-Prix, Günther took pole position, posted the fastest lap, and ultimately clinched the victory. With this standout performance, he’s now eyeing an even higher position, currently sitting fourth in the driver standings.German driver Pascal Wehrlein, another former F1 racer, began his Formula E career with Mahindra Racing before joining Tag Heuer Porsche. After winning the Formula E World Championship last season, Wehrlein has maintained his strong form, registering the fastest lap in two races this season—at the São Paulo and Mexico City E-Prix. He’s currently in eighth place with 25 points but remains a serious contender with 7 career wins and 6 pole positions to his name.Mitch Evans, a consistent presence with Jaguar TCS Racing since 2016, continues to be among the best drivers in Formula E. He secured a win for Jaguar at the São Paulo E-Prix in December, propelling him to seventh in the standings with 25 points, keeping him in the mix for the championship.At just 20 years old, Taylor Barnard is quickly establishing himself as one of the brightest young talents in Formula E.

Who founded Formula E

All eyes are currently on Formula 1 , as the season kicked off last month in Australia. However, there's another motorsport series that deserves just as much attention—one that not only thrills but is also in tune with the global movement for sustainability. Enter Formula E, the FIA-recognized single-seater world championship. Like Formula 1, it showcases high-speed racing, but with a key distinction: it’s environmentally conscious. Formula E uses all-electric cars, offering a cleaner, greener alternative to traditional motorsports while also driving innovation in the electric vehicle sector.Formula E cars are smaller, lighter, and require far fewer tire changes over the course of the season, which helps minimize their environmental footprint. And if you’re wondering whether these electric racers can deliver the same level of excitement as Formula 1, consider this: the Generation 3 Formula E car can reach speeds exceeding 100 km/h, proving that sustainability and speed can indeed go hand in hand.The ABB FIA Formula E Championship is currently in its 11th season, with the next race—the Miami ePrix—set for April 12. The season will run until July 27, with many more thrilling races scheduled across the globe.Formula 1 has been around since 1950 and has only evolved into hybrid vehicles relying on fossil fuels like E10 fuel (a mix of 90% petrol and 10% renewable ethanol). In contrast, Formula E is the motorsport of the 21st century after coming into existence in 2014. These races feature all-electric cars that run on powertrains converting energy from a battery into motion.One of the most striking differences between the two sports is how the cars handle tire changes. In Formula 1, teams often swap tires multiple times during a single race due to varying track conditions. In Formula E, however, teams are only allowed to change tires twice throughout the entire championship. The tires used in Formula E are made from natural rubber and recycled fibers, and are specifically designed to perform well in all weather conditions.Despite this difference, Formula E is by no means inferior. While a Formula 1 car can reach speeds in excess of 350 km/h, the new Formula E Gen3 Evo can reach 322 km/h, but it can accelerate faster than a F1 car. It can go from 0-100 km/h in 1.86 seconds., faster than many Formula 1 cars.Although both series use the same chassis, battery, and tires, the real performance differences come from the powertrains provided by each team. There is one aspect where Formula 1 still holds an edge, primarily due to the electric car's battery limitations. As the battery depletes, an electric car loses speed, requiring a pit stop to recharge in a flash. A Formula 1 car, on the other hand, can maintain top speed even with a quarter tank of fuel.Additionally, Formula E cars must be kept light—around 284 kg for the battery, which accounts for one-third of the car's weight that’s fixed at 840 kg, including the driver.Despite the technical differences, Formula E has its own appeal. Even Red Bull driver Max Verstappen has acknowledged how difficult it can be to drive the RB21. In comparison, electric cars in Formula E are simpler, with single-speed transmission and no gear shifts necessary, unlike the multiple gears in a F1 car.Currently, Formula E features 11 teams, with 22 drivers. Unlike Formula 1, where the top speeds are often the focus, Formula E records are typically based on average race speeds. The fastest race in Formula E history took place in Cape Town in 2023, with an average speed of 132.2 km/h.Practice sessions are held on Friday and Saturday, lasting 30 minutes each, giving drivers a chance to fine-tune their performance.Qualifying: Drivers are split into two groups based on their championship standing. Each group has a 10-minute session to set the fastest lap at 300 kW. The top 4 from each group then advance to the ""duels"" stage, where drivers face off head-to-head at 350 kW in a series of quarter-finals, semi-finals, and a final. The winner of the final claims pole position.The top ten drivers receive points using the standard FIA system (25–18–15–12–10–8–6–4–2–1). The pole position winner earns an additional 3 points, while the driver setting the fastest lap (if they finish in the top ten) receives 1 point.Drivers can deploy a combined 8 minutes of Attack Mode during the race. It provides additional power, activated by driving through a designated area of the circuit off the racing line. All Attack Modes must be used before the end of the race.A new feature has been introduced this season. It requires all drivers to make a mandatory 30-second pit stop to recharge their car's batteries at 600 kW. This adds 3.85 kWh of energy (around 10% more) to be used for the remainder of the race.Formula E was founded by Spanish businessman Alejandro Agag, who serves as the company's Chairman, while Jeff Dodds is the Chief Executive Officer. Many may not realize that Warner Bros. Discovery is among its shareholders.","Formula E is the FIA-recognized single-seater world championship.

Since its inception, the Nissan Formula E Team has led the charge, but a number of other teams are rapidly closing the gap in a sport that blends speed, innovation, and sustainability.All teams are currently using the Formula E Gen3 Evo cars fitted with Hankook tires. These cars can reach a top speed of 322 km/h—the fastest for any Formula E car—and accelerate even quicker than an F1 car. Needless to say, the Formula E fever is rapidly spreading among motorsport fans. Among the 11 teams, Nissan boasts 21 wins in 136 races, along with 50 podium finishes. Envision Racing, Jaguar TCS Racing , and Lola Yamaha ABT Formula E Team are also among the top contenders.Nissan recently added another victory to its impressive tally. Oliver Rowland steered the team to a win at Jeddah E-Prix II in February, marking their second victory of the season after the Mexico City E-Prix in January. Rowland is now joined by Norman Nato, who took a transfer from Andretti.Tag Heuer Porsche won the 2023–24 Formula E World Championship, thanks to Pascal Wehrlein. This year, he remains in top form, having recorded the fastest lap in two races. He has been joined by Antonio Felix da Costa, the Season 6 champion, who is also performing well, having won four out of five races last season. The team now has 12 wins and 25 podium finishes in 78 races.DS Penske is also having a strong season, with Maximilian Günther claiming a victory at the Jeddah E-Prix I after taking over as the lead driver. Günther dominated the weekend by securing pole position and recording the fastest lap. Jean-Éric Vergne, the other DS Penske driver, is expected to maintain his strong form this season.Jaguar TCS Racing started the season with a win. Mitch Evans led the team to victory at the São Paulo E-Prix in December. Both Evans and Nick Cassidy earned four wins last season, alongside multiple podium finishes and pole positions. The team now has 17 wins and 47 podium finishes in 115 races.Andretti Formula E Team has been around for a while, securing 11 wins and 37 podium finishes. Driver Jake Dennis continues to impress, and he is now joined by new addition Nico Mueller.Envision Racing is consistently among the top teams in Formula E, with 16 wins and 53 podiums in 136 races. Both drivers, Sébastien Buemi and Robin Frijns, are experienced and remain in top form.Neom McLaren has 8 wins and 29 podium finishes in 91 races. Taylor Barnard, who became the youngest driver in Formula E history at 19, is now a full-time driver for the team, alongside Sam Bird.Maserati MSG Racing has been taking a slower approach, with 10 wins and 28 podium finishes in 136 races. The team has added two new drivers: Jake Hughes and Stoffel Vandoorne.The team recently faced a setback when Nico Mueller moved to Andretti after contributing significantly to the team’s success. Lucas di Grassi, along with rookie Zane Maloney, is competing for the team this year. Lola Yamaha ABT has 14 wins and 47 podium finishes in 119 races.Mahindra Racing has yet to fully catch up with the competition, having secured only 5 wins and 24 podium finishes, despite competing alongside top teams like Nissan and Envision Racing. Nyck de Vries and Edo Mortara are driving for Mahindra Racing.Cupra Kiro is trailing behind in the competition, but there is hope for the team this season, as David Beckmann set the fastest lap at the São Paulo E-Prix. Dan Ticktum is the other driver for the team.","The current Formula E season is in full swing. 11 teams and 22 drivers are battling it out across 16 races at 10 locations.

PUNE: Ankita Raina and Prarthana Thombare pulled off the decisive doubles rubber to help India pip Thailand 2-1 in their second match of the Billie Jean King Cup Asia-Oceania Group 1 women’s team tennis competition on Wednesday. The Indians overcame Peangtarn Plipuech and Patcharin Cheapchandej 7-6 (3), 3-6, 10-3 to help the hosts register their first win of the competition at the Shiv Chhatrapati Sports Complex in Mhalunge-Balewadi, Pune.Shrivalli Rashmikaa once again put the team in front as she beat a higher-ranked Lanlana Tararudee 6-2, 6-4 but Sahaja Yamalapalli conceded the second singles against Mananchaya Sawangkaew due to cramps one game into the third set.With temperatures running in excess of 40 degrees Celsius for the fourth successive day, it was a gallant effort from Sahaja to level the scores 3-6, 7-6 (3). But the fightback in energy sapping conditions took a toll and the 24-year-old, writhing in pain, was helped off the centre court after two hours and 18 minutes of gruelling duel.“She is fit; we will see to it that she is ready tomorrow,” captain Vishaal Uppal said. India take on Hong Kong on Thursday.In the other matches, New Zealand beat South Korea 2-1 and Hong Kong upset Chinese Taipei 2-1.Shrivalli demonstrated her growing confidence while giving a winning start to the Indian team. The Hyderabad girl — with a smooth serving action and fluid, strong ground strokes on both the flanks — broke Tararudee twice in both the sets, although in different circumstances.Shrivalli — ranked 345th in the world, which is nearly 190 spots lower than her rival — nudged ahead 4-2 in the first set when Tararudee double-faulted on second breakpoint. The Thai saved the first one with an ace down Shrivalli’s backhand before the latter set up another chance with an accurate service return that landed right at Tararudee’s feet.Tararudee, impressive with her accuracy and placement, upped her intensity in the following game, pulling Shrivalli wide and opening up the court. But the Indian did well to hold off the challenge. Shrivalli rode on the momentum to close the set in the 10th game when Tararudee put an overhead smash into the net on breakpoint.The 23-year-old Indian dropped serve in the opening game of the second set against the run of play and it seemed Tararudee, world No. 166, had taken control of the proceedings for a while. Shrivalli then turned it around brilliantly when, trailing 2-4, took the next four games in a row to clinch the match.The focus then shifted on Sahaja, who ran away to a 3-0 lead.","Ankita Raina and Prarthana Thombare pull off the decisive doubles rubber to help India pip Thailand 2-1 in their second match of the Billie Jean King Cup Asia- Oceania Group 1 women’s team tennis competition.

They lost to Latvia away the following year. Four years on, things couldn’t have been more different.The highest-ranked player in the field is World No. 41 Lulu Sun from New Zealand. The 23-year-old of mixed heritage caught the attention with her quarterfinal run at the Wimbledon as a qualifier last year, beating then World No. 8 Qinwen Zheng in the first round. Besides Sun, Thailand’s Mananchaya Sawangkaew (world ranked 110) and Lanlana Tararudee (166) as well as Joanna Garland of Chinese Taipei pose a major threat.“It’s a very even group. If you see the rankings of all the teams, they’re very similar, not much to choose from. So that makes the group very tough and very competitive,” Uppal said.Changes have swept through the Indian team as well. None of the players is ranked in the top-300, unlike in 2021 when Ankita Raina was 183. The side is also without Karman Kaur Thandi, who had broken into the top-200 in 2018 but is currently unranked owing to a lengthy injury layoff. Yet, Shrivalli Rashmikaa and Sahaja Yamalapalli have kept the hopes alive with some stand-out performances.There couldn’t have been a stronger fourth singles player than Vaidehee Chaudhari while Prarthana Thombare brings in the much needed experience and solidity as the doubles player.",India's women play in the AsiaOceania Group 1 competition of the Billie Jean King Cup.

Carlos Alcaraz revealed at the Monte Carlo Masters press conference on Sunday that the pressure to overtake suspended Jannik Sinner as World No. 1 has negatively impacted his performance this season, with his only title in 2025 coming at Rotterdam two months ago.The 21-year-old Spanish tennis star currently sits at world number three, trailing Sinner by 3,610 points in the rankings.""A lot of people are asking me, or are telling me, that I have the chance to become number one if Jannik is not playing. So probably that pressure has killed me in some way,"" Alcaraz said during the press conference.""I'm not surprised because the people always say that we have to win the tournaments or the top people have to be there all the time playing finals or winning tournaments,"" he added.The Monte Carlo Masters marks the beginning of the clay-court season, a surface where Alcaraz has previously excelled, winning the French Open last year and consecutive Madrid Masters titles in 2022 and 2023.Sinner, the current world number one, received a three-month doping ban in February after testing positive twice for clostebol traces in March last year. The 23-year-old Italian is expected to return at the Rome Open in May.""I'm just thinking that I'm not able to become number one... in the clay season, even if Jannik is not playing, I don't have the chance to do it,"" Alcaraz stated. ""I think I'm too far from Jannik. So I'm just here and I realise that I don't have to think about it and just go there and play.

NEW DELHI: Jannik Sinner , the three-time Grand Slam champion , received a three-month ban after testing positive twice for the banned substance clostebol .The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) agreed to the ban after Sinner admitted ""partial responsibility"" for team mistakes.Umberto Ferrara , Sinner's former physical trainer, has spoken publicly about the scandal for the first time. He claims to be blameless and places the responsibility squarely on Sinner's former physiotherapist, Giacomo Naldi .""I was perfectly aware that it was banned so I always kept it safely stashed away in my wash bag. I suggested to Naldi to use it for a cut which had not healed and was affecting his work. I was absolutely clear when I spoke to him about the nature of the product and it was imperative it never came into contact with Jannik. In effect I told him to use it only in my bathroom. Naldi did not deny he had been told, but he said he could not recall,"" he told Gazzetta dello Sport.Ferrara states that he had been using a spray containing clostebol, prescribed by a doctor for an illness, and had kept it safely stored away.He suggested that Naldi use the spray for a cut that was not healing, but explicitly warned him to use it only in Ferrara's bathroom and to ensure it never came into contact with Sinner.According to Ferrara, Naldi did not deny being warned about the nature of the product but claimed he could not recall the instructions.Ferrara alleges that Naldi treated Sinner without gloves and without washing his hands after using the spray, despite the warnings.Ferrara acknowledges that, in hindsight, he would not have handled the situation the same way. He expresses regret over the behavior of others and claims to have suffered due to the ""bad faith of some.""Sinner's suspension ends on May 4, allowing him to return in time for the French Open. The clay-court tournament in Hamburg will be his second tournament after his return, followed by the Italian Open in Rome.","Jannik Sinner received a three-month ban after testing positive twice for the banned substance clostebol.

Instead, he delivered a near-flawless performance, using his powerful serve and aggressive baseline game to become the first Czech player since Tomas Berdych in 2005 to win an ATP Masters 1000 event.Djokovic, appearing troubled by an issue under his right eye, frequently applied eye drops and consulted his team.Still, Mensik capitalised, racing to a 3-0 lead in the first set before Djokovic clawed back. In the tie-break, Mensik dominated, building a 5-0 advantage before closing it out with an overhead smash.The second set saw Djokovic applying pressure from the baseline, but Mensik remained composed, dropping just one break point in the match.

World number one Aryna Sabalenka secured her first Miami Open title by defeating American Jessica Pegula 7-5 6-2 in the WTA 1000 event final at Hard Rock Stadium on Saturday. This victory marks Sabalenka's second title of 2025, following her Brisbane triumph in January, and her eighth WTA 1000 title overall.Sabalenka, who had recently lost the Indian Wells final to Russian teenager Mirra Andreeva, showed determination not to repeat that outcome in Miami.""I'm super happy to have this trophy, I was able to play my best tennis in the final,"" said Sabalenka, acknowledging Pegula's performance and referencing their previous encounter at the US Open final.The first set was marked by service struggles, featuring seven breaks of serve.

She broke twice to establish a 3-1 lead and maintained her dominance to complete the victory in one hour and 27 minutes.""I think I was able to completely forget about (it being) the final, about the outside things and I was just so focused on the game,"" Sabalenka reflected.The Belarusian has won 12 of her last 14 matches against top 10 players, attributing her success to her performance in crucial moments.""It is all about those key moments of the match, about playing aggressive and staying with the game plan, going for shots without being afraid of losing the point,"" she explained.This marked Pegula's third loss to Sabalenka in a final.

Football superstar and Argentina's World Cup-winning captain Lionel Messi was in attendance at the Hard Rock Stadium on Friday, where Novak Djokovic advanced to the Miami Open final with a commanding victory over 14th-seeded Grigor DimitrovIn pursuit of his 100th singles title, and seventh in Miami, Djokovic won 6-2, 6-3 and will face upstart Jakub Mensik, who upset Taylor Fritz 7-6 (7-4), 4-6, 7-6 (7-4) in the other semfinial, for the title.During his post-match court interview, Djokovic recognised that Messi, who currently represents Inter Miami in Major League Soccer, was present, referring to him as ""King Leo.""Djokovic revealed that Messi, accompanied by his wife and children, visited the locker room where they exchanged presents. While Djokovic had previously attended Messi's matches, this marked the first occasion where the football star watched him play.""Obviously, it's a thrill to have his whole family,'' Djokovic said. ""It's a huge honour. He's such a great athlete, not just a football player. His impact on the world of sports in the last 20 years has been immense.""To have him watch me live brings me great joy and excitement and also a little pressure. It's definitely different when he brings his family. I was touched by that.""The 37-year-old Djokovic's performance hasn't been up to his lofty standards, beginning with a withdrawal due to injury at the Australian Open in January. At Indian Wells earlier this month, he suffered a first-round defeat against Botic van de Zandschulp.During the third game, play was halted when security personnel escorted a disruptive spectator from the venue. The chair umpire descended from his position and approached the stands while summoning security staff.Dimitrov engaged in a verbal exchange with the spectator and proceeded to direct the umpire's attention to the location of the troublesome fan at the sideline.""It's just heckling, it's fine,'' Dimitrov said. ""I'm a very calm guy overall. I don't pick any fights but don't trigger me.''Despite Dimitrov securing an early break against Djokovic in the opening game, the Serbian regained composure and secured the first set in 32 minutes.The current men's record holder of 24 Grand Slam titles displayed remarkable serving efficiency, landing 87% of first serves with merely six misses throughout the match. He maintained exceptional control, recording only five unforced errors during the 70-minute contest.""Now I know how it feels to be (John) Isner and (Reilly) Opelka,'' Djokovic said of two serving behemoths. ""Maybe my serve has been a bit underrated.""Djokovic extended his dominant head-to-head record against Dimitrov to 13-1. The Bulgarian player showcased his finest performance during the match.""He wears confidence like a stain on your shirt,'' Dimitrov said. ""It's beautiful to see. Only a few athletes on earth possess that quality.''Mensik, who entered the Miami Open as world number 54, has yet to reach a final in an ATP 1,000-point tournament.In a crucial moment against Fritz, he displayed remarkable composure at 4-4 in the final tiebreaker, securing victory by winning three consecutive points.Throughout the match lasting two hours and 25 minutes, Mensik failed to break serve but managed to win with a brilliant backhand winner down the line at 5-4. Fritz subsequently lost the next two points, sending a forehand long after a 20-shot exchange and netting a forehand on match point.Prior to the match, Mensik had a handshake with Messi. ""I didn't wash my hands before I stepped on the court,"" Mensik said.Tennis inspiration came to Mensik through Djokovic, whom he faced in a three-set match at the Shanghai Masters last October. The age difference between them stands at 18 years.","Novak Djokovic beats Grigor Dimitrov 6-2, 6-3 to reach Miami Open final.

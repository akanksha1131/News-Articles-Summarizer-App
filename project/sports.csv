India vs Australia: Mitchell Starc's perfect response to Yashasvi Jaiswal in Adelaide,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/india-in-australia/india-vs-australia-mitchell-starcs-perfect-response-to-yashasvi-jaiswal-in-adelaide/articleshow/116061642.cms,"Mitchell Starc and Yashasvi Jaiswal (Image credit: AP)

ADELAIDE: Perth wasn’t an outlier. India and Australia kept Test cricket’s flag flying high here as the series acquired an edgy tone. The absorbing day evoked memories of past skirmishes and reminded us why reprising a five-Test series between these two is an idea whose time has come.You could see it even before a ball was bowled, when the turnstiles went into overdrive as the crowd swelled on a working day. You could see it when Mitchell Starc all but copyrighted the phrase ‘smiling assassin’ with just one delivery, his first, ripping apart Yashasvi Jaiswal ’s manicured swagger and then letting out a satisfying roar.You could see it in Shubman Gill’s fluent drives and composed attempts at resurrecting the innings. You could see it in under-fire Pat Cummins’ return to new-ball duties. You could see it in the recalled, 35-year-old Scott Boland’s nagging lengths. You could see it in the precocious Nitish Kumar Reddy’s flailing against the tide as India’s wickets kept tumbling.You could see it in Jasprit Bumrah’s heated exchanges with Marnus Labuschagne, as he fought to keep his place in the team. You could see it in Siraj’s fury as a drunk Aussie fan carrying an impressive beer snake interrupted the game. You could see it in Virat Kohli and Rishabh Pant’s constant chirping, a serious, coordinated attempt at unsettling the Aussies in the middle.Bizarrely, you could even see it when the lights went out at the stadium and South Australia’s minister for infrastructure immediately tweeted, “I can confirm there was no lack of power supply.”So, who turned the lights out?! This Test is where the stakes are rising. Soon there will be no second chances for the team which slips up. This is no scripted drama but real pressure. This is Test cricket, every tiny moment is part of a larger tapestry. When it all comes together well, there is no format quite just like it. And when India and Australia play, the masks are off.Australia ended the day on the ascendancy but they did so on the first day in Perth too, a game they eventually lost.India let Jaiswal and KL Rahul retain their opening combo and Rohit Sharma came down the order. Neither move worked. Ashwin earned a recall over Washington Sundar, but we don’t know why yet.“This team doesn’t need the coaches to go into the dressing room and tell them why they have to fight,” India’s assistant coach Ryan Ten Doeschate said, refuting notions that India was on the back foot in this Test.The ever-smiling Starc said on the Jaiswal dismissal: “Nice to sneak one past. He had a good Test match but that was last week. We’ll have to work on him (again) in the second innings.”With that one ball, Starc demolished notions that this ageing Aussie team had gone ‘too soft’, or that it lacked the fight. Wasn’t it Jaiswal who told the veteran seamer in Perth that he was “coming too slow”? India pacers struggled to control the pink ball under lights.Does Starc know where they fell short?“I’m not their bowling coach,” he offered.","India and Australia kept Test cricket’s flag flying high here as the series acquired an edgy tone.

We can get back in the game with a few tweaks: Ryan ten Doeschate

England's Gus Atkinson produced a sensational hat-trick on Saturday, dismantling New Zealand's lower order and setting the tone for a dominant performance on day two of the second Test in Wellington.Atkinson's stunning feat came in the morning session, making him the first England bowler in seven years to claim a Test hat-trick. He bowled Nathan Smith for 14, had Matt Henry caught behind, and trapped Tim Southee LBW in successive deliveries, leaving New Zealand all out for 125.Atkinson finished with figures of 4/31, sharing the spoils with fellow pacer Brydon Carse , who took 4/46.New Zealand resumed on 86/5 but could only add 39 runs in the first 40 minutes of play. Carse removed both overnight batters, bowling Tom Blundell for 16 and trapping nightwatchman Will O'Rourke LBW for a 26-ball duck. The Kiwi tail had no answer to Atkinson's accuracy and pace.With a commanding first-innings lead of 155, England's batters further tightened their grip on the match. Openers Ben Duckett and Zac Crawley started England's second innings, but Crawley's lean series continued as he was caught at midwicket off Matt Henry for eight, leaving him with an average of just 10.15 in 19 Test innings against New Zealand.Undeterred, Duckett and Jacob Bethell counterattacked, adding 73 runs off 82 balls by lunch. Duckett raced to 39 not out, while Bethell, intent on erasing his first-innings disappointment, contributed an unbeaten 34. England reached 82/1 at the break, extending their lead to a formidable 237 runs.Atkinson's hat-trick not only highlighted his growing stature in Test cricket but also shifted the momentum firmly in England's favour. As the visitors eye a series-clinching victory, their bowlers and batters seem to be firing in unison, leaving New Zealand with a mountain to climb heading into the remainder of the Test.","Gus Atkinson took a hat-trick on day two of the second Test in Wellington.

NEW DELHI: Vaibhav Suryavanshi , the 13-year-old prodigy, continued his remarkable form in the U-19 Asia Cup ODI tournament, leading India to a comprehensive seven-wicket victory over Sri Lanka in the semi-final.His blistering knock of 67 runs off just 36 balls, laced with five sixes and six fours, propelled India's chase of 174 with a staggering 170 balls to spare.India's bowling attack, spearheaded by Chetan Sharma (3/34), Kiran Chormale (2/32), and Ayush Mhatre (2/37), restricted Sri Lanka to a modest total of 173/9 in 46.2 overs.Despite a valiant effort from Lakvin Abeysinghe (69 off 110) and Sharujan Shanmuganathan (42 off 78), the Sri Lankan innings struggled to gain momentum against the disciplined Indian bowling.India's chase was built on a solid foundation laid by Ayush Mhatre (34 off 28) and Vaibhav Suryavanshi, who shared an opening partnership of 91 runs.Suryavanshi's aggressive intent was evident from the outset, as he started with consecutive sixes and a boundary off Sigera, who conceded 31 runs in his opening over.Despite losing his opening partner, Suryavanshi showcased remarkable maturity, forging another crucial partnership with C Andre Siddharth (22). He continued to take the attack to the bowlers with his aggressive strokes, including scoring two sixes off Aayan Khan.Skipper Mohamed Amaan (25 not out) and KP Karthikeya (11 not out) then completed the chase in style, guiding India to the final, where they will face Bangladesh on Sunday at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium.Bangladesh defeated Pakistan by seven wickets in the other semi-final, chasing down a modest target of 117 in 22.1 overs.","India beat Sri Lanka by seven wickets in the U-19 Asia Cup semi-final.

NEW DELHI: World chess number one Magnus Carlsen has delivered a stark assessment of the ongoing World Chess Championship match between India’s D Gukesh and defending champion Ding Liren .Reflecting on the state of the match after the ninth game, Carlsen, five-time world champion, remarked, “I think we have finally arrived at a moment when Gukesh is not a favourite in this match anymore. It’s as pure a 50-50 match as it comes.”The tightly contested championship has seen Gukesh and Liren locked in a dead heat, with the score tied at 4.5-4.5 after six draws and one victory apiece in earlier games.Gukesh, the 18-year-old prodigy from India, and Liren, the reigning champion from China, now have just five classical games left to determine who will claim the coveted title and the $2.5 million prize.Gukesh’s journey so far has been marked by moments of brilliance and frustration.While he secured a crucial victory in the third game, his inability to convert promising positions into wins in the seventh and ninth games has cost him dearly.Liren, a seasoned player at 32, has demonstrated resilience and resourcefulness, often pulling out surprises to neutralize Gukesh's attacks.A significant challenge for Gukesh lies in the possibility of tie-breakers. If the match remains deadlocked after 14 games, faster time controls will be employed—an area where Liren is considered stronger.Gukesh, aware of the stakes, has expressed confidence but acknowledges the need to refine his performance in critical moments.As both players head into the decisive final stretch, Gukesh is focusing on maintaining energy and composure. The rest day on Friday offers a brief respite before the 10th game on Saturday, where the young challenger will seek to regain the initiative and tilt the balance in his favour.","Magnus Carlsen says India's D Gukesh is not a favourite in World Chess Championship match against China's Ding Liren.

India start the second Test vs Australia with confidence

NEW DELHI: Sri Lanka batter Pathum Nissanka 's resilient knock of 89 runs played a pivotal role in Sri Lanka's fightback against South Africa on the second day of the second Test at St George's Park.Despite being dropped early in his innings, Nissanka capitalized on the opportunity and led Sri Lanka's response to South Africa's first-inning total of 358.Nissanka's innings was characterized by his ability to blunt South Africa's hostile seam attack, forming crucial partnerships with Dimuth Karunaratne and Dinesh Chandimal His 109-run stand with Chandimal for the second wicket laid the foundation for Sri Lanka's strong position at the end of the day's play, giving the Lankans some much-needed hope.While Nissanka missed out on a well-deserved century, being dismissed by Keshav Maharaj for 89, his contribution was instrumental in Sri Lanka reaching 242-3 at stumps, trailing South Africa by 116 runs.Earlier in the day, Kyle Verreynne 's counterattacking century propelled South Africa's first-inning total to 358 all out.Verreynne's aggressive batting, coupled with valuable contributions from the lower order, allowed South Africa to extend their innings and set a challenging target for Sri Lanka.Sri Lanka will aim to erase the deficit and establish a lead on a surface that appears conducive to batting on Day 3 of the encounter.The performances of Angelo Mathews and Kamindu Mendes, who remained unbeaten at the close of play, will be crucial in determining the outcome of this must-win Test for both teams in their pursuit of the World Test Championship final.","Pathum Nissanka played a pivotal role in Sri Lanka's fightback against South Africa.

England players mull Hundred boycott amid NOC policy dispute,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/england-players-mull-hundred-boycott-amid-noc-policy-dispute/articleshow/116053213.cms,"(Photo by Gareth Copley/Getty Images)

A potential player boycott of the Hundred competition next year is brewing, according to a report. This stems from the England and Wales Cricket Board 's ( ECB ) revised No Objection Certificate (NOC) policy for participation in overseas franchise tournaments.Approximately fifty prominent English cricketers are reportedly considering this action. This information comes from a recent report highlighting player discontent with the ECB's new policy.Last week, the ECB announced its intention to withhold NOCs for tournaments clashing with the English summer. The exception to this rule applies to cricketers with white-ball-only county contracts, reported The Telegraph.""This includes the Pakistan Super League , which moves to a slot concurrent to the Indian Premier League (which is controversially exempt from the policy) in April and May next year,"" the report said.The new policy appears to prevent players from receiving NOCs for any competitions overlapping with the Vitality Blast or the Hundred.""Next year, that includes Major League Cricket , Canada's Global T20 league and the Lanka Premier League, as well as the Caribbean Premier League. The list of leagues clashing with the domestic summer is only likely to grow,"" the report said.The ECB's stance has prompted several discussions between the players and the Professional Cricketers' Association (PCA). Players met with PCA members on Monday, followed by a meeting between their agents and PCA officials on Wednesday.The report suggests that ""a group of 50 leading English cricketers"" are contemplating a Hundred boycott. It remains unclear whether any players currently on the Test tour of New Zealand are involved in these discussions.""It is understood, however, that the players have held early discussions about the possibility of taking a collective stance around next year's Hundred,"" the report said.The players' proposed strategy reportedly involves refusing to negotiate retention contracts with their current teams. They would also refuse to participate in the draft unless the NOC situation improves.""The nascent plan involves refusing to enter negotiations around being retained by their teams, and then refusing to enter the draft unless the NoC situation is resolved more to their liking.""The number of players engaged in these discussions is estimated to be between forty and fifty. Many of these players have represented England at the international level.""It is thought that between 40 and 50 players have been involved in discussions around this already, with more hoped to follow. This group includes a significant number of players who have represented England.""This potential player boycott could have ramifications for the ECB's efforts to sell stakes in the eight Hundred teams. The league's success relies on attracting and retaining top-tier talent to maintain a high standard of play. The report underlines that the best players are needed to ""keep the standard high"".","A potential player boycott of the Hundred competition next year is brewing, according to a report.

We can get back in the game with a few tweaks: Ryan ten Doeschate

India's assistant coach Ryan ten Doeschate explained the decision to select Ravichandran Ashwin over Washington Sundar for the second Test in Adelaide. The team believed Ashwin's experience and pink-ball Test record made him a more potent option on the Adelaide Oval surface.Australia finished the first day strongly, reaching 86/1 after dismissing India for 180. This marked a significant turnaround after their heavy defeat in the series opener at Perth.Ten Doeschate acknowledged Sundar's consistent performance since joining the team. He pointed out Sundar's contributions during the New Zealand series. The decision to prioritize batting depth influenced the selection for the Adelaide Test.""Yeah, Washy hasn't put a foot wrong since he's come into the fold, halfway through that New Zealand series... I guess the thinking going into the last Test, we wanted to strengthen the batting,"" ten Doeschate said at the post-day press conference.""And given what we saw of Nitish in the first Test, we kind of thought we'd go with what we perceived to be the guys bowling the best spin at the moment. And we feel Ash is more likely to get wickets in these conditions.""""When you get the confidence of Nitish batting at 7, it doesn't really matter with Ash batting at 8. And that was the thinking. Not much to choose between them. And we just thought that Ash would be slightly more effective on this wicket,"" he added.Despite Australia's substantial lead, ten Doeschate remained optimistic about India's chances. He highlighted the team's fighting spirit and ability to stage comebacks, as demonstrated in Perth.""I know that the scores look like there is a big gap between the two teams but we still feel we are in the game and with a few tweaks tomorrow (Saturday), we can get back in the game.""Ten Doeschate emphasized the team's inherent resilience and desire to perform well. He expressed confidence in their ability to turn the match around.""This team doesn't need the coaches to go into the dressing room and say we need to fight. The guys understand that implicitly and it's obviously a very proud team who wants to come here and do well.""We feel slightly behind the game now but there certainly won't be any letting up and certainly won't be any surrendering. There certainly is a little bit of swing and a little bit of seam still there. So we're pretty confident we can still turn it around.""He reiterated the team's determination, drawing parallels to their comeback in the Perth Test. He dismissed the notion of surrender.""At Perth, we got bowled out for 150 and still we got back into that game. This is a proud team and the players want to come here and do well. We may be slightly behind in the game now but there certainly won't be any surrendering.""Addressing the question of limited pink-ball experience, ten Doeschate acknowledged the format's unique challenges. He emphasized the team's efforts to adapt during the preparation week.""I just think it's the nature of it. If you're going to bring the pink ball into it, it's obviously great for the crowds. It's a little bit different for the players and we try to use the week as best we can to help them to adapt to the small differences.""I don't think there are huge differences and I certainly don't think there's anything to read into about how the guys performed today.He attributed the cluster of wickets to the nature of pink-ball cricket and Mitchell Starc's effective bowling. He highlighted the need to learn from the first innings performance.He added that things happen a bit faster with the pink ball.""Things happen in clumps, we lost wickets in clumps, which we wanted to avoid. I also thought that Mitchell's (Starc) stock ball was very good and there are lessons to be learnt from that first innings. We will look at how we can play better in the second innings.""Ten Doeschate praised the 21-year-old all-rounder Reddy for his resilient innings on the first day. He acknowledged Reddy's significant contributions in both Perth and Adelaide.""We are so chuffed with him. From the prep week in Perth, where he looked like he still needed to figure things out, the way he worked in Perth and the game plans he implemented in Perth, to get crucial runs there, I think to get us to 150 in that first game was amazing.""Just the way he's gone about his work here. It's obviously the first pink ball game he's playing in. There's still a little bit of work to do. He's very raw. But for a young kid, a 21-year-old, to come out like that and play three innings of the quality he has, it's super exciting.""There's obviously a chat about Washy not playing. But he's done everything a young player could do in a very short space of time. And we think he's got a very high ceiling.""Ten Doeschate outlined India's strategy for the second day, emphasizing an aggressive approach in the first session while keeping the overall match situation in mind.""I think we'll go as hard as we can in the morning but be slightly conscious of what the rest of the day looks like and what we need to do to get back into the game.""","Australia finished the first day strongly, reaching 86/1 after dismissing India for 180. This marked a significant turnaround after their heavy defeat in the series opener at Perth.

England dominated the first day of the second Test against New Zealand in Wellington. Harry Brook 's century and a late flurry of wickets put the visitors in a commanding position.New Zealand finished the day at 86-5, trailing England's first innings total of 280. Brydon Carse's dismissal of Kane Williamson just before stumps was a significant blow for the hosts. Tom Blundell and nightwatchman Will O'Rourke were at the crease at the close of play, with New Zealand facing an uphill battle.The first day's play was fast-paced, mirroring the tempo of the first Test in Christchurch, which England won convincingly.Harry Brook's impressive 123 off 115 balls was the cornerstone of England's innings. He continued his excellent form from the first Test, where his 171 was instrumental in England's victory.England found themselves in early trouble at 43-4 after being asked to bat on a green Basin Reserve pitch. Brook's innings proved to be a rescue act.Brook rated this century as his ""favourite"" among his eight Test hundreds. This is a notable statement, considering his 317 against Pakistan in Multan.Brook's aggressive approach, charging down the pitch to disrupt the New Zealand bowlers, proved highly effective.""Just the circumstances really. The pitch was doing quite a bit, seaming and swinging, and I put my attacking mode on, really took it to them.""""In the situation of the game, and the way I played, I felt I was really putting them under a lot of pressure.""New Zealand's top order struggled against the pace and bounce of the England attack in the final session.Devon Conway was the first to fall, caught behind off Gus Atkinson for 11. Tom Latham was then bowled by Ben Stokes for 17.Rachin Ravindra was caught by a diving Carse at close quarters off Chris Woakes for three.Carse then dismissed the dangerous Kane Williamson, caught by Ollie Pope for 37. This wicket was a crucial moment in the day's play. Daryl Mitchell edged Carse to Pope, leaving New Zealand reeling at 86-5. Carse finished the day with figures of 2-28.Williamson had a fortunate escape earlier in his innings when he was bowled by a no-ball from Carse.Brook and Ollie Pope's 174-run partnership for the fifth wicket was the turning point of England's innings. Their counter-attacking approach rescued England from a precarious position.The partnership echoed their 151-run stand in the first Test, which also played a vital role in England's victory.Brook's innings included five sixes and 11 fours. He was eventually run out on the last ball of the second session.Brook took responsibility for his dismissal, attributing it to a misjudgment in calling for a tight single.Nathan Smith, who took 4-86 for New Zealand, praised Brook's talent and described him as a rising star.""He's in that crop of new young cricketers -- him, Rachin (Ravindra) and the guy from India (Yashasvi Jaiswal) -- put those guys in the same category.""""He's world-class and today he was keen to take the game on and it paid off for him. He played some ridiculous shots so full credit to him.""Will O'Rourke dismissed Pope and Stokes in the second session before Smith wrapped up the tail after tea. O'Rourke finished with figures of 3-49.New Zealand's catching, which was a concern in the first Test, was much improved. They took three sharp catches in the opening overs.Matt Henry dismissed Ben Duckett and Zak Crawley early on. Duckett was caught by a diving Latham at second slip for a duck, while Crawley was bowled for 17.Smith had Jacob Bethell and Joe Root caught behind. Mitchell took a sharp catch at first slip to dismiss Root. Bethell scored 16, while Root managed only 3.","England dominate first day of second Test against New Zealand in Wellington.

India start the second Test vs Australia with confidence

NEW DELHI: The opening day of the second Test between India and Australia at Adelaide Oval on Friday was marked by an unusual and frustrating interruption — a floodlight failure that halted play twice in quick succession during Australia’s first innings.The incident caused the stadium to be plunged into darkness in the final session of the day, leaving players and fans alike puzzled.The disruption came at a pivotal moment during India’s bowling attack, with pacer Harshit Rana bowling at the time, as witnessed in a video that has since gone viral across social media platforms.As the lights flickered off, he appeared visibly frustrated, with his rhythm completely broken by the delay.After a brief pause, the match resumed, but the floodlight failure had already sparked a frenzy on social media, where fans couldn’t resist commenting on the strange turn of events.One user humorously referred to the situation as a ""Karachi feels in Adelaide"" moment, drawing comparisons to similar lighting issues witnessed in the past during matches in Pakistan.The incident quickly went viral, with memes and jokes flooding X (formerly Twitter), making light of the bizarre interruptions.Many pointed out the striking similarity to past instances of chaos due to malfunctioning floodlights, adding to the fun of the moment.Despite the disruptions, the match continued, with Australia’s performance at stumps leaving them trailing India by 94 runs.At the close of Day 1, Australia’s score read 86/1, with Marnus Labuschagne (20*) and Nathan McSweeney (38*) at the crease.India had posted 180 all out in their first innings, with Mitchell Starc causing most of the damage, taking six wickets for 48 runs.The day ended with both teams left to reflect on a rather eventful evening, one that would surely be remembered for more than just the cricket played on the field.","A floodlight failure halted play twice in quick succession during Australia's first innings.

NEW DELHI: The third season of the International League T20 ( ILT20 ) is set to commence on January 11, 2023, in Dubai. The tournament has gained a reputation for its competitiveness and serves as a platform for UAE players to develop their skills.One of the standout players preparing for the new season is West Indies batter Nicholas Pooran , who led MI Emirates to the title in the previous edition.Pooran is determined to make an impact once again and is hopeful of retaining the title with his team.“It's nice to be back for the third season of the ILT20. We're really looking forward to this season. We're hoping to do our best again this year and try to retain the title, but there's a lot of hard work ahead for me and the team to make that happen,” said Pooran.“Each year, I feel the quality of the tournament keeps improving. The ILT20 is doing a better job every single year. I think competitiveness is important and it feels like international cricket with nine overseas players and two UAE guys,” he added.Pooran also recognized the ILT20's crucial role in nurturing cricketing talent in the UAE, providing local players with the opportunity to learn from some of the best in the business.“It's obviously challenging. Every year, every competition brings new challenges. Going into this season, preparation begins over the Christmas period. I'm working on getting my body back in shape, hitting a lot of balls, and getting my mind in the right place. When January comes, hopefully, I'll have some luck on my side. You play each game on its merit—every game is a new opportunity, and it's about doing what the team needs. So, let's see how the new season goes,” Pooran opined.Last season, Pooran was the second-highest run-scorer, amassing 354 runs at an impressive average of 50.57 and a strike rate of 170.Another standout performer from MI Emirates was UAE's Muhammad Waseem , who finished as the fourth-highest run-scorer in the tournament.Pooran praised Waseem's aggressive batting and consistency, saying, ""There are a lot of talented players in the UAE. I've played with Waseem over the years, and he has been incredible right from when he got his chance. He seized that opportunity, and he's been brilliant for us with MI in both seasons. He's one of my favourites, for sure. I hope he continues to do great things for himself and his family.""As the new season approaches, Pooran is focused on preparing himself physically and mentally, working on his fitness and spending time in the nets.“We have passionate fans, not just here but in India and across the world. Hopefully, we can keep putting smiles on their faces and bring more titles to them,” concluded the West Indies cricketer.","The third season of the International League T20 ( ILT20 ) is set to commence on January 11, 2023, in Dubai.

Pink-ball Blues: India batters flounder on 11-wicket day in Adelaide,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/india-in-australia/pink-ball-blues-india-batters-flounder-on-11-wicket-day-in-adelaide/articleshow/116044073.cms,"Australia quick Mitchell Starc dismissed Virat Kohli for 7 in the first session on Day 1. (Photo credit: ICC)

Mitchell Starc scalps six

KL Rahul promises, perishes

Nitish Kumar Reddy spunk continues

India fail to make the most of twilight

Much like the first day of the opening Test, the second Test also witnessed a wicket-ravaged start in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy . If the first Test had 17 wickets fall on Day 1 in Perth, the day-night Test in Adelaide accounted for 11 wickets on Friday. 10 of those 11 wickets belonged to India who lost their last nine wickets for 111 runs. At the other end, they lost a wicket on the first ball of the contest.Once looking at reaching 200-250 runs, India were dismissed for 180 and led by 94 runs at close with the Aussies reaching 86/1 at stumps. Mitchell Starc claimed a career-best 6/48 and was the lynchpin behind India's collapse inside two sessions. With the new pink ball in hand, Starc struck first ball to send Yashasvi Jaiswal packing and his massive roar made clear how much they fancied that wicket. Jaiswal had struck a match-changing 161 runs in Perth to put the game beyond Australia's reach.Just when KL Rahul and Shubman Gill looked to be getting into the groove of things, Starc returned to end the 69-run stand with KL guiding the ball to Nathan McSweeney at gully. Next over, Virat Kohli 's indicisiveness got the better of him as well to become Starc's third.Starc dismissed R Ashwin for 22 and bowled Harshit Rana in the same over to complete his five-wicket haul - his first against India in Test cricket.With backs against the wall, Nitish Kumar Reddy tried to go into the attack but was done in by the extra pace from Starc.KL Rahul opened the batting for India after being promoted to the spot in the first Test in Rohit Sharma 's absence. He took his time to get underway and rode on plenty of luck. The right-hander, on nought at the time, was dismissed off Scott Boland on a no-ball and then was let go of by Usman Khawaja in the same over.When he got going, he looked in good touch and was careful in his approach - not going after ones that were outside the off stump and not succumbing to the pressure applied by the Aussie quicks.Not for the first time in the series, KL Rahul was guilty of reacting late - this time getting the bat to a rising Starc delivery and was caught in the gully region.It is also not the first time he's been unable to make a positive start count. The 32-year-old has played 94 innings and been dismissed in under-25 runs on 57 occasions. When he's gone past that mark, which he did in Adelaide, he's been unable to convert that into fifties or century on 13 of 37 instances or 35% of the times.Nitish Kumar Reddy continued to make his mark in just his second Test match. After 41 and 38* in Perth, the 21-year-old maintained that scoring spunk in Adelaide even though he was getting his first test of the pink ball.With wickets falling on the other side and the Aussie quicks dominating the proceedings, Nitish played fire with fire, hitting three sixes. One such maximum was an audicious reverse scoop off Scott Boland that brought out a smile from Jasprit Bumrah at the other end and a sheepish grin from the Visakhapatnam-born player.Like Perth, Nitish top-scored in the first innings for India and didn't retreat into a shell. Maybe that is something for the rest of the batting lineup to consider.India bowled 33 overs in the final session but were only able to show one wicket off it. Bumrah, Mohammad Siraj and Harshit Rana were pumped, aggressive, beat the bat plenty of times and swung the ball around beautifully but were guilty of not targeting the stumps enough.In Perth, where India took seven Australian wickets on the opening day, they largely bowled wicket-to-wicket. On Day 1 at Perth, India bowlers bowled 31% on the stumps and just 10.9% balls were outside off. Result? 7/65. Today, meanwhile, they bowled only 20.3% of the deliveries at stumps and 21.3% were outside off. Not so surprisingly, the result was 1/86.",Mitchell Starc takes career-best 6/48 on Day 1 of second Test in Adelaide. India lose their last nine wickets for 111 runs to be bowled out for 180. Australia reach 86/1 at stumps on day two of Border-Gavaskar Trophy match.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116046554,imgsize-51082,width-400,resizemode-4/116046554.jpg"

Barcelona 's first La Liga win in a month was powered by their skipper Raphinha who disturbed the net twice to lead his team's emphatic 5-1 victory over Mallorca on Tuesday.The game also marked the return of Lamine Yamal after almost a month since his ankle injury, while the tournament's leading goal-scorer Robert Lewandowski was given a much-deserved rest after playing 20 games in a row across competitons.Four of Barcelona's game came in the second half as they tormented the Mallorca defence in the last 45 minutes of the match. The league leaders had secured just one point in three matches before Tuesday.Barcelona now lead the standings with 37 points, maintaining a four-point advantage over Real Madrid, who have two matches remaining. Atletico Madrid hold third position with 32 points.""We knew how important it was to win again,"" Raphinha told Movistar Plus. ""In the last three games something has been missing. Today we were good; it wasn't our best game, but winning was the most important thing.""The visitors secured an early advantage when Ferran Torres capitalised on a defensive error in the 12th minute. The sequence began when Johan Mojica's clearance struck his teammate, with the ball falling to Torres, who finished by shooting between the goalkeeper's legs.Barca created a few chances in a slow-paced first half and Mallorca striker Vedat Muriqi levelled the scoring from a quick counter attack just before the break.Yet Barca came out flying in the second half and Raphinha, who almost scored from a free-kick minutes earlier, restored their lead from the penalty spot in the 56th minute after Yamal was fouled inside the box.Yamal crossed to Raphinha to extend Barca's lead with a tap-in in the 74th minute and substitutes Frenkie De Jong and Pau Victor added to the goal-feast with late strikes from inside the box to wrap up an easy win.",Raphinha scores twice as Barcelona beat Mallorca 5-1.

NEW DELHI: A tragic stampede at a football stadium in southern Guinea resulted in 56 fatalities and numerous injuries following fan clashes, as announced by the Guinean government on Monday.The government has initiated an investigation to identify those responsible for the Sunday incident, according to Communications Minister Fana Soumah 's televised statement.Local media and political groups reported that children were among those who lost their lives, reported news agency AP.The incident occurred on Sunday afternoon at Nzerekore stadium during a local tournament final between Labe and Nzerekore teams, organised to honour military leader Mamadi Doumbouya , as stated by Prime Minister Amadou Oury Bah on X.Bah confirmed casualties without providing specifics, noting that regional authorities were working to stabilise the situation.According to local reports, security forces deployed tear gas to control the chaos that erupted after a contested penalty decision.Media Guinea reported that the disputed penalty sparked supporter outrage, leading to stone-throwing and subsequent tear gas deployment by security forces. The outlet noted that children were among the deceased, with several critically injured victims receiving treatment at a regional hospital.Video footage from the venue showed supporters protesting referee decisions before conflicts erupted, with spectators spilling onto the pitch.The recordings captured people fleeing the stadium, with many scaling the high perimeter fence.Additional footage showed numerous casualties on a hospital floor surrounded by people providing assistance to the wounded.The National Alliance for Alternation and Democracy opposition group demanded an inquiry, criticising the tournament as a vehicle for promoting the military leader's ""illegal and inappropriate"" political aspirations.Guinea has been under military governance since the 2021 coup that removed President Alpha Conde. It joins other West African nations, including Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso, where military takeovers have delayed civilian rule restoration.Doumbouya, who led the coup three years ago, claimed to prevent national chaos and criticised the previous administration's unfulfilled promises, though he faces criticism for not meeting public expectations.","A tragic stampede at a football stadium in southern Guinea resulted in 56 fatalities and numerous injuries.

Clashes erupted at a football match in N'Zerekore , Guinea , on Sunday, leaving many dead.According to hospital sources quoted by AFP, ""There are bodies lined up as far as the eye can see in the hospital. Others are lying on the floor in the hallways. The morgue is full.""""There are around 100 dead"", said one doctor, while another said there were ""dozens of dead"".According to witnesses, the anger was fueled by a referee's decision that was contested, after which the fans invaded the pitch and later also set the N'Zerekore police station on fire.Media reports indicated that the game was organised as part of a tournament dedicated to Guinea's current president and junta chief, Mamadi Doumbouya , who took control through a coup in 2021.In Guinea, these tournaments have become increasingly prevalent as Doumbouya appears to be positioning himself for the anticipated presidential elections next year, whilst political alignments continue to develop.In September 2021, Doumbouya, then serving as a colonel, led a successful coup against President Alpha Conde. Ironically, Conde had previously appointed Doumbouya to lead an elite unit responsible for protecting the president from such takeovers.Despite international demands and his initial commitment to transfer authority to civilian leadership by December 2024, Doumbouya has since reversed his stance and indicated he will retain power.","Clashes erupted at a football match in N'Zerekore, Guinea, on Sunday, leaving many dead.

I managed to stay in the game and in the set...""We're in the semis now, we're very happy, let's look forward to Friday.""Shapovalov clinched the first set against Struff with a fine forehand winner with the only break in the 10th game.Veteran Struff, world number 43, was up against the ropes for much of the second set but produced a break in the 11th game before holding to force a third set.The big-serving Shapovalov committed several double faults, with one resulting in Struff breaking for a 4-3 lead in the third set, moments after the Canadian had smashed his racquet onto the floor in frustration for losing the previous point.Shapovalov, ranked 56th, recovered to break for 5-5 as Struff faltered when serving for the match, leading to a tie-break.However the Canadian lost the match and the tie for his country with his 13th double fault.World number 88 Altmaier racked up a 5-0 lead in the first set tie-break against Diallo before closing it out to take the lead.In the second set Altmaier survived two break points in the first game and then broke himself in the 10th and final game to triumph as Diallo crumbled.""I wish I could have brought my team the point. They counted on me to deliver and I didn't deliver, so that's on me,"" said Diallo.Altmaier admitted he felt extremely nervous ahead of the match.""Definitely the nerves were a lot, I was saying to the captain in the morning when I was warming up I was really nervous coming up to the match,"" he said.""I guess (it) helps me a lot to communicate this openly, not to hide away my nerves.""","Germany beat Canada 2-0 in Davis Cup quarter-final in Malaga.

Questions linger over the format's feasibility but for now, the five-day game is enjoying a fine run in Australia. The

contest will only ramp up the expectations

MCG CEO Stuart Fox: 'We're going to go well over 2,50,000 through the gates'

MELBOURNE: The 'G' is calm. The picturesque Yarra Park offers shady trails and a pleasant afternoon breeze. In the distance, Melbourne's famous trams roll by. They are the soul of this city's public transport, not relics of a bygone era like elsewhere. People walk their dogs. An old lady sits on a bench, reading a book. Even the usually frenzied cyclists take a minute to slow down and soak in the vibe. In the distance, there's the sound of bat on ball.A nets session is on. The players are dressed in Test-match whites. It's open to public viewing. The superstars are training. There are people watching but there's no heckling, no mad rush for a glimpse. The pace is unhurried.It's the calm before the storm. Come Thursday, for the first time in an Australian summer, the 90,000-capacity colosseum that is the Melbourne Cricket Ground will see a full house for a Boxing Day Test . Across this rare five-Test series, it has seemed as if the crowds just can't stop pouring in. Even in Brisbane, where rain marred the contest on all days, the Gabba notched up the highest total attendance for a non-Ashes Test at 91,195.Earlier, Adelaide broke the record for an India-Australia Test match as 1,35,012 total spectators turned up for the pink-ball Test. In Perth, the opening two days broke attendance records.It's become fashionable to run the Test format down but talk to young fans across venues and there's no moaning over the format's length. Here, during the Border-Gavaskar Trophy , it's a good time to be a cricket traditionalist. Yet, peel away the layers and concerns linger over the future. This is a marquee series between two top teams on a strong financial footing and boasting a rich tradition. Even here, though, in the commentary boxes, in the members' stands, among the top cricket brains soaking in the action, there are murmurs of concern.Why are only the top teams playing so many Tests? Why are there so many uneven contests? Why is the format being allowed to fade away in the poorer cricketing nations? Why is it so hard to prepare a perfect Test-match pitch these days? Why aren't players playing out sessions anymore? Should there be four-day Tests? And most important of all, will the format still be financially viable if India loses interest?Through the course of this series, the questions have always lingered, and some of Australia's top cricketing minds have weighed in on the issue. Greg Chappell , former India coach, former Australia captain, has taken the pragmatic view. He believes it's a blessing, not a curse, that the big teams are playing the most Tests.""It's important for India, South Africa, Australia, England to at least keep playing Test cricket, otherwise the T20 format can completely take over,"" he said. ""The top players still love playing Tests, but it's the rung just below that which is vulnerable. These players can play 20-over cricket, even 50-overs, but Tests are sometimes too hard for them. We forget how hard it is to actually play Test cricket.""Chappell believes the decline of the West Indies, not the birth of One-Day Internationals, was a huge blow. ""One of the tragedies has been losing West Indies. Sri Lanka have declined because they don't produce enough fast bowlers. They just need to look towards India. In the last 15 years or so, India have made a focus of producing pacers. Now they're beating everybody everywhere,"" he said. Former Australia heavyweight Adam Gilchrist said the attitude of modern batsmen has altered the natural rhythm of the format.""It's been a really entertaining period of Test cricket to watch. Is it very difficult for batters to be defensive these days? I have a different theory here. They've got the ability to do it. At this level, they also have the skills to do it. It's just a mindset thing,"" he said.""In general, teams are playing a more attacking style of Test cricket. There were teams in previous eras who could do that too, but there's definitely been an effect of T20 cricket filtering into long-version cricket. The best players still know when they can slow down a bit, when they've got more time.""Gilchrist is convinced four-day Tests would work better. "" Michael Vaughan (former England captain) mentioned that maybe you can have four-day Tests. That will help with scheduling and workloads. Then you can put it in the calendar, like a weekend thing. It's very hard to follow any Tests, where it's on, when it's on. Maybe there's something in that idea to invest in. I think we're going to see more and more shortened Tests just because of what we spoke about, the attacking part.""The legendary Allan Border , an Australian institution, has a different view. ""Sometimes the pitches dictate the contest,"" he said. ""Four-day Tests would be a bit artificial. You won't get the 300s, the guys making the big scores. No one wants boring draws but with five days, you really get the time to resolve matters. The wickets have to be more natural. I'm also not sure Pakistan have declined along with the rest. They just need a good captain to bring it all together, like when they had Imran Khan . The West Indies have become a T20 team.""In the end, like Chappell said, ""the administrators are going to go with the money"". This has been an interesting year for Test cricket in general, with West Indies beating Australia in Brisbane, India winning in Cape Town, New Zealand whitewashing India, Bangladesh beating Pakistan in Pakistan, Pakistan beating England. Even India beating England at home was an absorbing series earlier in the year.The BCCI poured money into the format to keep players interested. The World Test Championship race has been intriguing. However, smaller teams kept slipping away because of broadcaster disinterest. It's unclear how the ICC's mooted 'Test match fund' will work. Tests have ceased to be a level-playing field.This has been a frenetic series so far, so perhaps the biggest question going into the MCG Test is, how long will it last? With huge demand for tickets, broadcasters would want a longer game but as always with Tests, there are no guarantees.Happily, for now, Test cricket seems to be in its natural habitat here in Australia. Much like the Melbourne weather though - blazing hot one moment and bone-chilling the next - there could be turbulence ahead.","Questions linger over the format's feasibility but for now, the five-day game is enjoying a fine run in Australia.

Jacob Bethell: A 'generational talent' in the making?

Caribbean roots, cricketing dreams

The evolution of Jacob Bethell: From classy Test batter to explosive white-ball cricketer

Stadium Walkthrough series: Inside The Gabba

What can RCB expect from young Bethell?

NEW DELHI: The cricketing fixture between Rugby School and Marlborough College, two of Britain’s most historic independent schools, is a cherished tradition in the English sporting calendar. Dating back to the mid-1800s with the only recent interruption being the COVID-19 pandemic, which disrupted life as we knew it, this storied rivalry holds a special place in the hearts of cricket buffs across Wiltshire and Warwickshire.In 2021, during one such historic encounter, English cricket was on the brink of discovering what Indian spinner R Ashwin has recently described as a potential ""generational talent"". The player in question? None other than Royal Challengers Bengaluru 's newest Rs 2.6 crore recruit, Jacob Bethell .Representing the shades of Rugby School, where he honed his cricketing skills after moving to the UK, Jacob Bethell chose the first innings of the annual two-day fixture to demonstrate his overall mettle. With a stunning knock of 202, he caught the attention of many, including Michael Powell, Rugby School’s Director of Cricket and a former Warwickshire captain.""We had scored over 400 before tea on the first day, with Jacob contributing 200 of those runs. He was playing at a different level from everyone else that day. Then, he went on to take nine or ten wickets in the match as well. The way he went about his business was remarkable,"" recalled Michael during an exclusive interaction with TimesofIndia.com.Michael Powell, however, finds it hard to decide what is more remarkable — the dazzling innings from that fixture or the meteoric rise of young Jacob Bethell, now 21.Over the past few months, Bethell has achieved what few can claim: making his ODI, T20I, and Test debuts within the span of just three months. Even more striking, he became the first English batter since Mike Gatting in 1978 to earn a Test cap without a first-class century to his name, showcasing the high regard in which England Cricket holds him.Coach Michael is a firm believes that his protégé Jacob is destined for greatness. Hailing from a family deeply rooted in cricket — his father and grandfather both being former professional cricketers — Jacob has justified his decision to leave the Caribbean and test his legacy with the willow in the UK.""I took a call from a good friend of ours who was on a cricket tour in Barbados - a cricket tour that I had set up at my previous school in Scotland but had subsequently left. This friend, whose sons were in my boarding house because I was a housemaster there, said that there was a young boy, about 11 years old, who was smashing all their 17-and 18-year-old bowlers around Barbados at the moment. He used to work with the boy's father, Graham Bethell, and that was my first point of contact,"" shared Michael.""He put me in touch with Graham and Giselle Bethell, Jacob's parents, and we started a dialogue. Eventually, they brought Jacob to Rugby School. I then took him over to Edgbaston, to Warwickshire, and introduced him to the academic director, Paul Greetham. That’s how it all began. They explored quite a few schools in the UK because Jacob had trained with the Franklyn Stephenson Academy before. Eventually, they decided on Warwickshire and Rugby School.""Recalling his first meeting with Jacob around a decade ago, the former Warwickshire cricketer continued, ""Jacob was only 11 years old when he first came to visit. He met me, and we had a great afternoon looking around the school. I had already seen a few videos that had been sent to me, including one that has since become quite famous on Instagram — showing him pulling shots as a very young 10-year-old batsman [batter] in the West Indies.""Barbados-born-and-raised, Jacob is known for being deeply family-oriented. The 21-year-old manages to carve out time for his father Graham, mother Giselle, and sister Rebecca, who followed her brother's footsteps and joined Cheltenham College a year later, marking a shared commitment to education and opportunity in the UK.The siblings spent around 32 weeks annually in the UK, dedicating the rest of the year to cherished family moments back home in Barbados.The cricketing blood in Jacob’s veins runs deep, with his father Graham spending many years playing for Sheffield Collegiate in England, where he was teammates with Joe Root ’s father, Matthew Root. Meanwhile, his grandfather, Arthur, was the former captain of the Barbados cricket team in the West Indies.""When he was growing up as a youngster, he probably had a bat in his hand by the age of three. Just the way he operated as a young player at the time — in all aspects, batting, bowling, and fielding — was remarkable. He had a really natural bat swing, as if the bat had been in his hands since his earliest days.""Growing up in Barbados, cricket was in the family and in his genes. He lived an outdoor life in Barbados, blessed with good weather. At home, he had a lovely little setup with a rope and a ball at the end of it, and he would spend hours swinging and hitting the ball. His bat swing was incredibly natural,"" noted Michael.Understood to be a natural athlete, Jacob grew up immersed in a variety of sports — surfing on the beaches of Barbados, playing cricket in the sand, and enjoying golf, tennis, and squash. His innate sporting talent has likely been a key factor in his seamless transition from a graceful stroke-maker in Test cricket to a dynamic power-hitter in white-ball formats.""His early setup and approach to batting were very much Test-match-oriented. As a young player, he was very respectful in how he played and left the ball, yet positive in how he looked to score. However, when he was younger, he didn’t have the power he has now. That’s something he’s gained over the last four or five years,"" explained his childhood tutor.From a young age, Jacob was incredibly stylish, particularly excelling against short-pitched bowling, having grown up facing tall West Indian bowlers who frequently bowled bouncers, which helped him develop his ability to handle the short ball.""I remember the first time I saw him bat — a tall West Indian lad ran in, bowled a bouncer, and Jacob pulled it away. Not many 9-or 10-year-olds could do that. He had a real fluency and fluidity in his bat swing, with great energy and rhythm in how he picked up and swung the bat. He handled taller, faster young West Indian bowlers remarkably well,"" Michael said.""His game has since developed to adapt to the modern game, particularly the white-ball format. Now, as we’ve seen more recently, he can hit the ball out of the park. When I first met him, he struggled to hit the ball off the square or in front of the wicket. He was fantastic with the pull shot and a great sweeper of spin bowling but lacked the physical power to pierce gaps in front of the wicket,"" he added, ""Of course, that power develops with time as a young player grows, and now he’s a strong, athletic young man. He has the ability to hit 100-metre sixes just as easily as he can play the softer game: rotating and manipulating the ball with finesse.""With RCB stacking up their top-order with right-handers, Jacob Bethell, as a left-hander, could be the perfect solution. With Virat Kohli and Phil Salt likely to open the innings, Bethell could slot in at No. 3, with Rajat Patidar following at No. 4, creating a balanced lineup. This versatility, along with his handy slow left-arm orthodox bowling and wicket-keeping skills, has many RCB fans predicting that the English talent will be a regular fixture in the playing XI.""To me, he always looked like a top-order batsman. He thinks like a top-order batsman. The nature of T20 cricket, The Hundred, and white-ball cricket, in general, has pushed him to develop his skills further. Fundamentally, his technique is built for Test cricket, but he’s also developed into a very potent white-ball cricketer. You could class him as an all-rounder or a top-order batsman who bowls very effectively, keeps wicket and fields brilliantly,"" Michael told TimesofIndia.comIn terms of attitude, Michael thinks he is a natural leader. ""As a youngster, Jacob was in England's senior team very early on, and he’s always been a natural leader by example. He’s in a fantastic environment, surrounded by the likes of Joe Root, Ben Stokes, Brendon McCullum , and Marcus Trescothick , who have all performed at the highest level for extended periods. He has the benefit of learning from some of the best minds in the game,"" he added.""For him to be put into the IPL auction, to be chosen, and to have the opportunity to play cricket in that environment is incredible. The IPL is the biggest league in the world, and now he has the chance to be around players like Virat Kohli,"" the man, who has seen Jacob blossom in front of his eyes, concluded.""I know Jacob is made for this—he’s been working toward this his whole life. It’s an incredible opportunity for someone who has put in so much effort. I’m sure RCB fans will thoroughly enjoy watching him, as he’s looking forward to becoming part of the RCB family.""","Jacob Bethell is Royal Challengers Bengaluru's newest Rs 2.6 crore recruit.

While acknowledging the move, Donald was effusive in his praise.“It really is incredible to have an absolute Indian legend join us. He’s such an intelligent cricketer, and for me, it’s a joy to watch and listen to him commentate. He’s truly a breath of fresh air. It’s wonderful to see an ex-international player with such a wealth of IPL experience being signed for SA20. It’ll be amazing to watch him play if he does take the field,"" Donald said.""He is still a fine cricketer and can perform at a high level.

Having him around will be fantastic and will mean so much to young cricketers, without a doubt,"" he added.Donald credited the IPL with revolutionizing cricket , noting how its growing popularity influences leagues worldwide. “As I’ve said before, young cricketers everywhere in the world are looking up to Indian superstars and the Indian Premier League, which continues to get bigger, better, and faster every year.

FIFA introduces interim regulatory framework for player transfers after Lassana Diarra case,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/top-stories/fifa-introduces-interim-regulatory-framework-for-player-transfers-after-lassana-diarra-case/articleshow/116607908.cms,"FIFA (AP Photo)

NEW DELHI: FIFA, the international governing body for football, has implemented an "" interim regulatory framework "" concerning player transfers .This decision follows a ruling by the European Court of Justice (ECJ) earlier this year in a case involving former French midfielder Lassana Diarra.The changes come just over a week before the January transfer window opens and were made after consulting with key stakeholders.The interim framework addresses several aspects of FIFA's regulations governing the status and transfer of players, including compensation for contract breaches, joint and several liability, inducement for contract breaches, International Transfer Certificates , and proceedings before the Football Tribunal .The objective is to provide clarity and stability ahead of upcoming registration periods while upholding globally uniform rules.The ECJ ruling in October found that certain FIFA rules regarding transfers were contrary to European Union laws on freedom of movement, siding with Diarra in a case dating back to 2014.Diarra's contract with Lokomotiv Moscow was terminated, and the Russian club sought €20 million in compensation from the player. Diarra refused and requested compensation from Lokomotiv.FIFA initially ordered Diarra to pay €10 million to his former club, a decision upheld by the Court of Arbitration for Sport, and he received a backdated 15-month suspension.The ECJ ruled that FIFA's regulations, which could make clubs liable for fines if they signed Diarra, were contrary to EU law and hindered free movement and competition between clubs.FIFA's interim regulations will apply immediately and will not affect ongoing discussions regarding potential long-term changes to the player registration and transfer system.","FIFA has implemented an "" interim regulatory framework "" concerning player transfers.

Fans protest with banners

KOCHI: The usual fanfare surrounding a home fixture of the Kerala Blasters at the Jawaharlal Nehru International Stadium was missing as they took on Mohammedan SC here on Sunday night. There was an unprecedented silence at the stadium when the Blasters players took the field for the match, as the home fans held the Blasters’ management responsible for their poor run in ISL this season.However, by the end of 90 minutes, Blasters not only rediscovered their winning touch by blanking MSC 3-0 but also managed to turn that silence into cheer from a small turnout of 15,000 who came in for a holiday fixture.With this win, Blasters are now in tenth spot in the points table with 14 points from 13 matches, while MSC remain at the bottom of the heap with five points from 12 matches.Though the first half of the game was more about missed passes from both teams, the dynamics changed after MSC goalkeeper Bhaskar Roy’s goalkeeping blunder helped Blasters open their account in the 62nd minute,. MSC defender Joe Zoherliana conceded a corner, which was taken by Adrian Luna. Goalkeeper Bhaskar Roy tried to punch the ball away but his mistiming saw the ball falling into his own net, giving the hosts a 1-0 lead.After conceding the lead, MSC were forced to attack, but they were guilty of opening up space in their defence, which Blasters striker Noah Sadaoui exploited. In the 80th minute, MSC failed to clear the line as Korou Singh, after receiving a pass from Luna, found Sadaoui with a long cross from the right. With a brilliant header, Sadaoui doubled the lead for Blasters.In the 90th minute, Alexandre Coeff, who came on as a substitute replacing Sadaoui in the 86th minute, scored Blasters' third goal. Coeff received a pass from Luna and beat Bhaskar Roy to complete the tally for the hosts.On Sunday, Manjappada, the official fan group of Kerala Blasters, stayed away from their usual stadium activities, including chanting and singing the anthem. Around 15,000 spectators turned up for the match, of which a group came with a banner that read ‘Leaders or Liars’, venting their ire at the team management. There was another banner on the east stand which read, ‘Promises made, trust betrayed.’",Kerala Blasters beat Mohammedan SC 3-0 at the Jawaharlal Nehru International Stadium.

NEW DELHI: Manchester United suffered a humiliating 3-0 home defeat against Bournemouth on Sunday, marking their second consecutive disappointing result after their League Cup quarter-final exit at Tottenham on Thursday.Bournemouth took the lead in the first half through Dean Huijsen's goal, capitalising on United's poor set-piece defending.

'Super afraid': Jannik Sinner and Iga Swiatek doping issues heighten tension among players,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/top-stories/jannik-sinner-and-iga-swiatek-doping-issues-heighten-tension-among-players/articleshow/116601911.cms,"Jannik Sinner (AFP Photo)

Professional tennis players are increasingly worried about unintentional doping violations due to contamination, especially after recent high-profile cases involving Jannik Sinner and Iga Swiatek . Both players faced doping charges but were eventually cleared. These incidents highlight the challenges athletes face regarding supplement contamination and the complexities of the anti-doping system.Sinner and Swiatek, who both reached the top ranking in professional tennis, incurred substantial expenses to demonstrate the unintentional nature of the banned substances found in their systems. This financial burden raises concerns for players with fewer resources.“A lot of the players I know are quite apprehensive,” former U.S. Open champion Emma Raducanu said.Raducanu expressed her concerns about the risk of contamination in supplements and the financial burden of batch testing. Many players are cautious about the supplements they take due to the risk of contamination.“Everything we take, we're aware of the situation and how easily things can be contaminated. There are certain supplements that I may want to take, but I can't take them because they're sold over the counter and not batch tested.”The cost of batch testing, exceeding $1,000, creates a financial barrier for many athletes.Russian tennis player Andrey Rublev , a former world number five, shared similar anxieties about consuming anything he's not entirely certain about. He admitted to being 'super afraid.'Andrea Petroczi, a researcher on anti-doping at Kingston University in London, confirmed the growing apprehension among elite athletes worldwide regarding unintentional doping violations due to contamination. Her research reveals increasing concerns among athletes about the potential consequences of such violations.“(They) expressed fear and anxiety about unintentionally violating anti-doping rules that could have grave consequences on their reputation, careers and livelihoods,” Petroczi explained.Athletes are adopting various precautionary measures to minimize the risk of contamination. These measures include thoroughly checking medications, avoiding unnecessary treatments, and opting for third-party tested supplements.Athletes also meticulously record batch numbers of supplements and medicines. Some even go to the extent of maintaining detailed logs and avoiding specific foods in certain countries. However, they recognize that even these precautions cannot entirely eliminate the risk.“Importantly, it's also crucial to acknowledge that the resources and strategies required for this level of vigilance aren't universally accessible,” Petroczi emphasized.The accessibility of resources and strategies for such vigilance varies across different regions. This disparity in access creates additional challenges for athletes in certain areas.“There is a clear 'Global North'/'Global South' divide, with disparities in education, resources and support systems, leaving many athletes more vulnerable.”Jannik Sinner's case involved trace amounts of clostebol, an anabolic androgenic steroid. He successfully demonstrated to doping authorities that the substance entered his system through massages administered by his physiotherapist.Despite being cleared, Sinner faces a potential ban of up to two years due to an appeal by the World Anti-Doping Agency. The ongoing appeal creates uncertainty regarding Sinner's future participation in professional tennis.Iga Swiatek, who tested positive for trimetazidine, a hormone and metabolic modulator, served a one-month ban. She attributed the positive test to contamination of her sleep medication.Swiatek revealed the significant financial costs she incurred in defending her case, including legal fees and expert opinions. She spent $70,000 on a lawyer and over $15,000 on expert opinions.“Importantly, it's also crucial to acknowledge that the resources and strategies required for this level of vigilance aren't universally accessible,” Petroczi emphasized.The handling of Sinner and Swiatek's cases contrasts with the experiences of other players, such as Simona Halep and Tara Moore , who have criticized the anti-doping system for lengthy delays in their cases. The contrasting experiences highlight inconsistencies in the handling of doping cases.The International Tennis Integrity Agency (ITIA) assumed responsibility for tennis's anti-doping program in 2022. The ITIA was formed by the seven governing bodies of tennis after a comprehensive review of the previous system, which was overseen by the International Tennis Federation.Sinner and Swiatek's cases are the most high-profile investigations undertaken by the ITIA since it took over. Both players held the world number one ranking when they failed their tests, further highlighting the significance of these cases.The ITIA asserts that all doping cases are handled impartially, based on evidence and facts, irrespective of a player's ranking, name, or nationality. However, concerns about potential discrepancies in the system persist.Petroczi highlighted the impact of limited access to legal representation and advanced analytical testing on an athlete's ability to effectively contest a doping case . These limitations create further disparities within the system.Being unable to access legal representation and advanced analytical testing would impact an athlete's ability to fight a doping case, Petroczi added, and sports federations and anti-doping organisations had to address this disparity in resources.Addressing the disparity in resources available to athletes requires collective efforts from sports federations and anti-doping organizations. These efforts should focus on ensuring equitable access to expert support and transparency in processes.“Efforts could include providing equitable access to expert support, ensuring transparency in processes, and exploring ways to mitigate the impact of resource gaps,” Petroczi suggested.Unlike athletes in many other sports, tennis players are essentially self-employed. Therefore, any time away from the game due to a doping ban or related legal battles directly impacts their income.Andrey Rublev advocated for quicker rulings in cases of accidental contamination and a degree of flexibility in the anti-doping rules. He believes the current system is overly strict and creates undue fear among players.“Of course, you want to have a clean sport,” Rublev stated.He emphasized the importance of maintaining a clean sport while also expressing concerns about the strictness of the current rules. He believes the system needs to be more flexible to avoid penalizing players for unintentional violations.“But you also want (it to be) not so strict because then you make all the tennis players so afraid that even those situations (that are not you fault) cost you a year.”The current system can lead to significant penalties, including lengthy bans, even in cases of accidental contamination. This creates a climate of fear among players.“It shouldn't be like that.”",Professional tennis players are increasingly worried about unintentional doping violations due to contamination.

Before this, he had triumphed in 2022, when he won the men's doubles Wimbledon title alongside Matt Ebden.He also finished as a runner-up in the Australian Open men's doubles final in 2020 and 2022.Purcell said he told the ITIA he had ""unknowingly received an IV infusion of vitamins above the allowable limit of 100ml"".""I was fully convinced that I had done everything to ensure that I had followed the WADA (World Anti-Doping Agency) regulations and methods,"" he said on Instagram, adding that he had been as transparent as possible.""This news was devastating to me because I pride myself on being an athlete who always makes sure that everything is WADA safe.""Tennis Australia made clear that the breach was for a prohibited method, rather than a prohibited substance.""The International Tennis Integrity Agency confirmed the breach relates to the use of a prohibited method, rather than the presence of a prohibited substance,"" it said in a statement carried by Australian media.""As the matter is currently under investigation, it is inappropriate to comment further at this time.""The ITIA is the same organisation that charged Jannik Sinner and Iga Swiatek over breaches of its anti-doping programme.Sinner was exonerated after twice testing positive for traces of the steroid clostebol in March.

CHENNAI: Touted as one of the brightest young players from India, 15-year-old Maaya Rajeshwaran Revathi has been called up to train at the prestigious Rafa Nadal Academy in Spain. Several top players have successfully graduated from the academy and made a mark in the sport.The Tamil Nadu teenager, who has signed a one-year contract, will begin her stint formally in January. Looking for training opportunities in Europe, Maaya chose the Rafa Nadal Academy.“We wanted her to train in Europe as it is one of the best places. The offer came directly from the Rafa Nadal Academy. They conducted a screening process for about a week or 10 days. After the screening, they offered her a contract for one year,” Manoj, Maaya’s personal coach and mentor for the past five years, told TOI on Friday.“Maaya has been assigned a dedicated coach. She will also have a coach who could travel with her for tournaments. Maaya had visited a couple of other academies and in the end, we (her coach and family) decided to take up the offer from Nadal’s academy,” Manoj added.The past few months have been pretty good for Maaya as she has defeated several top junior players in the ITF circuit . She went on to reach the final of the National Championships after getting through the qualifying stage. The stint at the academy could prove to be a game-changer and will be worth its weight in gold.“The next couple of years are very crucial for her. She needs to climb the ladder pretty quickly. I think that the focus should be more on doing well at the senior level. She needs to start doing reasonably well in the women’s circuit in another year or year-and-a-half. She has the potential to do well. On the women’s side, I think that she is the next bet forIndian tennis ,” said Manoj about Maaya, India No. 2 among juniors.While Maaya will be training in Spain, Manoj will continue to mentor her from India. “If she travels to or within Asia, maybe I could probably travel with her if that is a requirement,” Manoj said.Up next for the youngster is three ITF tournaments in India from December to January. “Maaya has opted not to play the junior Australian Open (if she gets into the qualifying draw). She has to get her visa to be in Spain for a year, so that will take a little bit of time.”","Maaya Rajeshwaran Revathi has been called up to train at the prestigious Rafa Nadal Academy in Spain.

Novak Djokovic will run out of energy: Andre Agassi,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/top-stories/novak-djokovic-will-run-out-of-energy-andre-agassi/articleshow/116235405.cms,"American legend

Andre Agassi

believes Djokovic will miss Federer & Nadal, the guys he came to the dance with

Excerpts:

Djokovic's longevity:

Andy Murray coaching Djokovic:

Carlos Alcaraz

and longevity…

American men haven't had results like the women:

Graf was the hardest victory I ever had: Agassi

BENGALURU: Andre Agassi wondered if the 24-time major winner Novak Djokovic would miss his greatest rivals -- the now-retired Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer -- in the last leg of a glittering career where the 37-year-old goes for more history.The eight-time Grand Slam champion, in the city for the TiE Global Summit, assessed Djokovic's run and the Serb's recent partnership with friend and rival Andy Murray in a candid chat with media.It's hard to say, Father Time always wins. He has already done so much for so long, it's hard to imagine longer. We said that about (Roger) Federer too. I think Novak will run out of energy more than capability. Cannot be easy, especially when the people you came to the dance with have left, that's a big thing.When Pete (Sampras) retired it was a blow to me, it set me back a little bit. It made me rediscover my inspirations on some level. Djokovic has lost the guys he made history with. It'll probably get tougher and tougher emotionally, but I would never bet against them. Bet against them at your peril.In any coach-student relationship you need trust and trust can take time, but it's nice when it starts with believing in somebody because you know that they know your experience. There's an asset to their history as competitors.Any success of a relationship is based on complete buy-in and that's always the part you have to wait and see. It's not what I know that changes your career, information doesn't lead to transformation, somebody has to counter that. That's the connector. I'm sure there's going to be a lot of trust immediately, we'll see how the results go.Alcaraz defends like Novak, has more power and spin like Nadal, hands and finesse like Federer but just because he has the best of all the three doesn't mean he can do what they did. There are so many parts to the game such as decision-making, injuries, luck. So how long can (Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner) do it (for)? They could do it for 20 years or not.The women's game hasn't had to deal with Roger Federer, Novak Djokovic, Rafael, Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz, but they have their version of it. Serena Williams is the Novak of the women's game and you got Coco as a potential, like Alcaraz has potential and Sinner has potential.How the game evolves is interesting. The women's game has gotten very powerful, just straight power. For lack of a better example, Lindsay Davenport was powerful, tall, precise through the court and now you have a lot of that. There's still room for somebody who can offset that kind of power, like an Ash Barty.The men's game has changed in the sense that guys have gotten bigger with longer levers, which means they're better athletes, they can move and they need more time, they start playing further back. Soon you're going to start seeing the net game start coming back, everything morphs in its own way. But the biggest issue for American (men) not winning is an unfortunate set of decades where the guys were very stingy and very greedy -- 66 Grand Slams in the same generation. There's not a lot left there (for others)!Andre Agassi - the second of five men to achieve a career Grand Slam in the Open Era and the first man to complete a career golden slam - has won it all, including a stirring love match.""She was the hardest victory I ever had,"" said Agassi of his wife German tennis legend Steffi Graf, a 22-time major winner.Agassi, who has won eight major titles and the Olympic gold, speaking during a session at the TiE Global Summit, said, ""We all live a hero's journey - first part of life is about performing and achieving. Then life hits us with broken relationships and dreams. I went through it all. Finally, in the last phase of the journey, it's about serving others.""The 54-year-old said, ""At 28 my (tennis) career started over. Without the struggles, I would've never gotten Steffi to say yes. I tried to get her for years.""On a lighter note, Agassi said he likes to keep his trophies out of the house. ""I don't bring my trophies home, because if I bring my trophies home, then she brings her trophies home - and that's bad math!""",Andre Agassi believes Novak Djokovic will run out of energy more than capability.

NEW DELHI: Legendary player Andre Agassi observed that Carlos Alcaraz embodies distinct qualities from Novak Djokovic Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal , while advising the tennis world against anticipating the young Spaniard to match the extraordinary achievements of these tennis legends.The collective Grand Slam victories of Federer, Nadal and Djokovic stand at 66, whilst Alcaraz, aged 21, has secured four major titles thus far.""I'm not a genius and I don't have a crystal ball. What I can tell you is Alcaraz defends like Novak, has power and spin like Nadal and has hands and finesse like Federer,"" said Agassi during a talk session in Bengaluru.The eight-time Grand Slam victor Agassi elaborated on why excessive expectations shouldn't burden Alcaraz.""Just because he has the best of all those three doesn't mean he can do what they did because there're so many other parts to the game, which mean decision-making, injuries, you know, luck,"" he said.With Djokovic at 37, approaching retirement, Agassi noted that the Serbian's competitive edge might diminish without Nadal and Federer in the arena.""He's already done so much, so long, and it's hard to imagine longer. I think he'll run out of the energy for it more than the capability of it, I would imagine.""It cannot be easy, especially when the people you came to the dance with have left.""The American provided additional context to his assessment.""When Pete (Sampras) retired, it was a blow to me. It set me back a little bit. It made me have to rediscover my inspirations on some level.""And he's (Djokovic) lost the guys that he's made history with. So, it's probably emotionally going to get tougher and tougher quickly, but I would never bet against him. Bet against him at your own peril,"" said Agassi.Regarding Djokovic's recent appointment of Andy Murray as coach to extend his career, Agassi expressed interest in their partnership's development.""They've been fierce rivals on court, and now Murray will be coaching Djokovic.

Trust can take time.""I think there's an asset to their history as competitors, but any success of a relationship is based on complete buy-in.""",Andre Agassi says Carlos Alcaraz embodies distinct qualities from Novak Djokovic Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal.

NEW DELHI: Tennis icon Andre Agassi on Tuesday highlighted how sports should remain integral to education, noting their role in teaching children to cope with defeat.At a Bengaluru event focussed on sports and education's role in fostering excellence, Agassi shared his insights.""Even when you have a failure, you have to get up and play again the next day. So, what sports is teaching you is that focusing on winning and losing is really a distraction from what we need to be thinking about. We need to be thinking about how to get better,"" he said.Since 2001, Agassi has invested in education for underprivileged children, establishing 130 schools serving approximately 80,000 students in the United States. He attributes this achievement to his persistent drive to overcome obstacles.His demanding tennis career shaped his ability to maintain focus and adapt when necessary.""Sports is all about problem-solving. Tennis taught me how to navigate a very intense environment and maintain my objectivity and problem-solving abilities. It forces me to be present, but also to understand the context of what I'm doing,"" Agassi said.Regarding his earlier defiant period, Agassi acknowledged it as a necessary phase in his journey.""Vulnerability is essential for growth, and I think vulnerability eventually leads to humility,"" he added.He recognised technology's crucial role in education, particularly in providing individualised learning opportunities for children. This belief influenced his investment in the Indian EdTech company, Square Panda .""I think technology can play an essential role, not just in scalability, but also in optimising personalised learning. That's why I got involved with Square Panda.

Head coach feels lucrative prize money & better scheduling could draw top stars

BENGALURU: Over the past five years, the number of Indian star shuttlers featuring in the individual events at the Senior national badminton championship has dwindled sharply. The ongoing competition at the Karnataka Badminton Association (KBA) here is no different. Of the six Indian men ranked inside the top 50 in the BWF rankings, only Satish Kumar Karunakaran, ranked 45, is competing, while Anupama Upadhyaya (ranked 46) and Aakarshi Kashyap (47) are the top-ranked women players in fray.As a result, Badminton Association of India (BAI) secretary general Sanjay Mishra recently said the federation in future could make the premier domestic event mandatory.India head coach Pullela Gopichand remarked, ""It’s always a challenge when you want (top) athletes to play two circuits, international and national, or national and state. Ideally, there should be only one calendar,"" he said here Sunday.""…the importance of the national championship has gone down. How do we revive it?"" he questioned.Scheduling is one of the key reasons for top players not featuring in the nationals. With the competition played at the year’s end, it is internationally offseason and an ideal resting period for the players. It is also the phase during which many of them begin preparations for the next season, which starts in early January.With star players focusing on major international events, which offer bigger prize money and ranking points, how can a player be convinced to play in the nationals?""You must give them benefits. Making it mandatory is one way, but they could just come, walk the first day, lose a match and walk off. That’s not the purpose. So, you want them to come here prepared and perform. So, either the prize money needs to be at a point where it is motivating or certain things such as an honour or a facility should be there,"" said Gopi.He also suggested the duration of the competition be reduced to three days.","Head coach feels lucrative prize money & better scheduling could draw top stars.

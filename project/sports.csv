ICC Champions Trophy 2025: India rest & reset ahead of New Zealand clash

Crisp Kohli, intense Shami

After a two-day break, the Indian cricket team was back to business as they had their first training session after the win (against Pakistan) on Sunday. The Men in Blue assembled at the International Cricket Council (ICC) Academy and trained for well over two hours under the lights.Right from the start of the session, where players warmed up by playing football, doing laps of the ground and shuttle runs, captain Rohit Sharma took it easy and didn't participate in any strenuous physical activity. He stayed with the team before the nets but largely remained in the background as the rest trained at full intensity.An hour into the session, Rohit started jogging gently under the watch of Strength & Conditioning coach Soham Desai but didn't seem to move freely. The skipper did some damage to his hamstring in the game against Pakistan and while he assured that it was okay, the movements on Wednesday suggested otherwise.Rohit didn't even face any gentle throwdowns and only did some shadow batting during his numerous discussions with head coach Gautam Gambhir and other members of the coaching staff. The game against New Zealand is still some time away (on Sunday) and the Indian camp would hope the captain is good to go for the last group game of the Champions Trophy Fresh from a hundred, Virat Kohli was at his crisp best when he batted for over an hour. He hit the ball long and looked in control while playing the cover drives too. The right-hander faced a mix of spin and seam and also faced throwdowns to break the monotony.Apart from Rohit, there was some concern around Mohammed Shami as well as the seamer played two games with very little gap and went off briefly in the match against Pakistan to get his ankle treated. There were however no visible signs of any discomfort on Wednesday when he bowled full tilt to the likes of Kohli, Rishabh Pant, Shreyas Iyer and KL Rahul and got constant feedback from bowling coach Morne Morkel, who rejoined the team after a personal emergency forced him to fly back home.The entire team looked in good spirits throughout the session and there was a lot of banter during their unique catching game right after the warm-up. India have already booked a semis spot after winning their first two games and would now look to maintain the unbeaten run before the knockouts.",The Indian cricket team had their first training session after the win (against Pakistan) on Sunday.

I thought we had our chances in the game. Another fantastic game of cricket, but disappointing to come out on the wrong side,"" added Buttler, whose side was in the match till the 48th over when they lost the wicket of Jamie Overton, who was going great guns at the back end.Buttler admitted that Afghanistan's strong batting in the final ten overs made things difficult for his team.""They got away from us there in the last 10 overs. Credit to Ibrahim (Zadran), he played a fantastic innings. If we look back and reflect, 113 off the last 10 pushed them up to a score that was a very good score on that pitch.""Root's ability to remain composed in the face of adversity and score his 120 was commended by the captain.""He played an unbelievable innings tonight.

NEW DELHI: Ibrahim Zadran 's magnificent 177 and Azmatullah Omarzai 's five-wicket haul propelled Afghanistan to a nail-biting eight-run win over England on Wednesday, eliminating the latter from Champions Trophy contention.In this crucial encounter at Lahore, Afghanistan amassed 325-7 before dismissing England for 317 in 49.5 overs, keeping their semi-final hopes alive whilst ending England's tournament journey.Despite Joe Root's valiant 120, England suffered their second consecutive ODI defeat to Afghanistan, following their unexpected loss during the 2023 World Cup in India.In a tense finale, with England requiring 13 runs from the final over with one wicket remaining, Omarzai displayed remarkable composure, conceding just four runs and claiming Adil Rashid's wicket.Afghanistan, competing amidst British political controversy regarding women's rights under Taliban rule, chose to bat first, aiming to recover from their initial loss to South Africa.The 23-year-old Zadran surpassed his previous ODI record of 162, crafting a masterful 146-ball innings that included 12 boundaries and six maximums.After a challenging start at 37-3 within nine overs, Zadran steadied the innings through a crucial 103-run partnership with captain Hashmatullah Shahidi, who contributed 40 runs.Subsequently, Zadran formed another significant partnership of 111 runs with Mohammad Nabi, who scored a quick-fire 40 from 24 deliveries.The 23-year-old Zadran surpassed his previous ODI record of 162, crafting a masterful 146-ball innings that included 12 boundaries and six maximums.He not only broke his own record for Afghanistan's highest individual ODI score but also a tournament record, days after Ben Duckett's 165 in England's opening loss to Australia.""I think it was one of the best ODI innings I have ever seen,"" said Shahidi.Wood's knee injury during his fourth over affected England's bowling performance, limiting him to just eight overs of action.England's response began poorly, with Mohammad Nabi's first delivery dismissing Jamie Smith for nine, leaving them struggling at 30-2.Despite Duckett and Root stabilising the innings with a 68-run partnership, Rashid Khan ended Duckett's innings at 38 with an lbw decision.A promising innings from Harry Brook ended on 25 when he offered a return catch to Nabi, further destabilising England's chase.Root maintained his composure whilst Buttler, after a cautious start, struck two sixes in their 83-run stand to keep England in contention.Afghanistan's disciplined bowling, featuring numerous dot balls, paid off when Omarzai dismissed Buttler for 38, caught at deep square-leg, followed shortly by Livingstone's departure.Root achieved his first ODI century in nearly five years and 37 innings, continuing to score boundaries alongside Jamie Overton.However, Omarzai ultimately claimed Root's crucial wicket, having him caught behind.""He played an unbelievable innings tonight.

He had another injury while bowling at the National Cricket Academy (NCA) after he had recovered from the first one.He made his debut for India last October. He finished the series with four wickets after hitting the 145 kmph speed often in his four-over performance in the opening match. Before the T20Is against South Africa in November of last year, he suffered another injury. Although he hasn't played competitive cricket since, LSG spent Rs 11 crores to keep him during the mega auction because of his pace and potential.Umran rose to fame in the 2022 Indian Premier League after a 20-wicket season for Sunrisers Hyderabad, during which he reached the 150 kph threshold several times.

""Kohli always knew he'd perform against Pakistan"" | Rajkumar Sharma | Exclusive interview

NEW DELHI: Australian cricket legend Ricky Ponting has heaped praise on Virat Kohli , acknowledging the Indian superstar's consistency and longevity in One Day Internationals (ODIs). Speaking on The ICC Review, Ponting — himself one of the highest run-scorers in ODIs — expressed confidence in Kohli's ability to finish as the format's all-time leading run-getter.Kohli, during his stunning century against Pakistan in Dubai at the ICC Champions Trophy , surpassed the 14,000-run milestone, and is ahead of Ponting, who is fourth with 13,704 runs, in the all-time ODI run charts. With 14,085 runs, Kohli trails only Kumar Sangakkara (14,234) and Sachin Tendulkar (18,426).""He's obviously been a champion player for a long, long time. And particularly in the white-ball formats, where he's been an unbelievably good 50-over player,"" Ponting said. ""I don't think I've ever seen a better 50-over player than Virat Kohli. Now that he's gone past me and with only two ahead of him, I'm sure he would want to give himself the best chance to be remembered as the all-time leading run scorer in the game.""Ponting believes Kohli's fitness and hunger will play a crucial role in his bid to surpass Tendulkar's 18,426-run landmark, a record many once deemed untouchable. ""As long as the hunger's there — obviously physical-wise, he's probably as fit as he's ever been and works exceptionally hard on that side of his game,"" he added.Despite Kohli needing over 4,000 more runs to overtake Tendulkar, Ponting refuses to rule him out. ""It's crazy when you think about it, isn't it? Just how good Virat's been over such a long period of time, yet he's still 4,000 runs behind Sachin. It just goes to show how good Sachin was, but also his longevity in the game,"" Ponting said. ""But with someone like Virat, you never write him off. If the hunger's still there, then I'm never going to write him off.""Kohli's century against Pakistan was another testament to his brilliance in high-pressure situations. His unbeaten knock not only steered India to a six-wicket win but also cemented his legacy with more individual milestones.The Indian bowlers, led by Kuldeep Yadav (3/40) and Hardik Pandya (2/31), restricted Pakistan to 241, ensuring a manageable chase. India stumbled early, but Kohli's unshakable presence in the middle, combined with Shreyas Iyer's composed 56, helped the Men in Blue get across the line comfortably.","Ricky Ponting hails Virat Kohli's consistency and longevity in ODI cricket.

"Big events do not bog Rachin Ravindra down, says his mentor Sriram",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/icc-champions-trophy-2025/big-events-do-not-bog-rachin-ravindra-down-says-his-mentor-sriram/articleshow/118569440.cms,"CHENNAI: Rachin Ravindra loves the world stage. The elegant southpaw has been New Zealand's man for the big occasions in recent 50-over global tournaments.Having racked up runs and finished as NZ's highest scorer in the 2023 World Cup in India, Rachin appears to be on a mission to conquer other lands of Asian cricket in the Champions Trophy . The 25-year-old could not have asked for a better initiation to the CT; the 'comeback man', walking out with NZ in a precarious position in the chase, struck a well-compiled match-winning century in the victory over Bangladesh in Rawalpindi on Monday.His composed knock in the Group A clash put a smile on the face of Sriram Krishnamurthy , a coach who has seen Rachin grow from a player with talent to a potential superstar. The left-handed batter, who had credited Sriram for his resurgence in recent years, had worked extensively with him at different teams in NZ, before the latter moved to Chennai to take up the head coach's role at the Super Kings Academy .The two of them share a close bond and connect frequently with distance not being a barrier. ""Rachin does not make it too big in his head. It is normal for us to think that we are playing on a much bigger stage. Sometimes, that can cripple us in terms of our mindset and how we naturally play. But with Rachin, knowing the boy, he does not get bogged down by the magnitude of the events. He approaches the games just like any other matches,"" Sriram told TOI when asked how the Kiwi manages to dish out his best at the highest level.""It allows Rachin to succeed because he does the same things that he normally does. Of course, in cricket, one cannot succeed in every game. But it is a nice coincidence that he happens to do well in ICC events,"" Sriram added.The Super Kings Academy chief coach felt that Rachin could pose a threat to the spin-heavy Indian pack in the forthcoming group match in Dubai, courtesy his ability to handle slow bowlers well. ""He is a good player of spin. He had shown it during the WC in India; he had scored 80-odd (75) against India in Dharamsala. He did well in the Test series in India as well. There is every evidence that he can contribute to a healthy NZ batting lineup,"" Sriram said.""He has played in Pakistan in the last few weeks, so the ultimate challenge will be to adapt to the surface in Dubai.

NEW DELHI: The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has confirmed the arrest and banning of the pitch invader who breached security during the Champions Trophy Group A match between New Zealand and Bangladesh in Rawalpindi on Monday. The individual, reportedly carrying a photograph of Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan leader Saad Rizvi, managed to evade security at the Rawalpindi Cricket Ground and approached New Zealand batter Rachin Ravindra for a hug before being apprehended by security personnel.This security breach has created concerns for the PCB, particularly as Pakistan is serving as the host nation for a major ICC event for the first time since the 1996 World Cup, marking a 29-year gap.“The PCB has taken serious note of the security breach that occurred yesterday when a spectator entered the field of play. Ensuring the safety of players and officials remains our top priority. As a responsible organisation, we have engaged with local security agencies, who have committed to increasing security personnel around the field of play at all venues and strengthening access control measures,” PCB said in a statement.“The individual involved was arrested and presented before a court of law today (Tuesday). In addition, he has been permanently banned from entering all cricket venues in Pakistan,” the statement read.Ravindra appeared unsettled after the spectator's unauthorised entry onto the field.“To prevent such incidents in the future, the PCB is working closely with security agencies and venue authorities to review and reinforce security protocols,” the PCB said.Ravindra's stunning century (112 off 105 balls) powered New Zealand to a five-wicket victory, securing their spot in the semi-finals.New Zealand will now take on India in their final group-stage match on Sunday.","The Pakistan Cricket Board has confirmed the arrest and banning of the pitch invader who breached security during the Champions Trophy Group A match.

Australia Test skipper Pat Cummins slammed a media outlet on Tuesday (25 February) for misquoting him about India playing all their matches in Dubai in the ongoing ICC Champions Trophy The seamer, who is nursing an ankle injury and recently became father for the second time, is not part of the eight-team ODI tournament which is taking place in Pakistan and Dubai. He took to social media to slam Code Cricket , an Australian digital sports platform for attributing a quote to him that he never said.""I have definitely never said this @codecricketau,"" Cummins posted on X., in a now deleted post, alleged that the Aussie fast bowler called out the unfair advantage given to India by the ICC in the Champions Trophy and termed the tournament a 'farce', saying teams should not be able to pick and choose where they want to play.India are playing their matches, including a potential final, in Dubai in the Champions Trophy owing to security concerns in Pakistan . The tripartite agreement was reached before the tournament began with BCCI, PCB and ICC the parties involved. Meanwhile other teams must travel between Pakistan and Dubai for their fixtures.The outlet shared comments by ex-England cricketer and now broadcaster Jonathan Agnew as that of Cummins. In them, Agnew said, ""I feel very uncomfortable about the way that India is being treated at the moment,"" he told""This is wrong; if you're going to play international tournaments, you can't pick and choose where you play and where you're not going to play. I don't see how long this can carry on for? It makes a farce of these tournaments,"" he added. Pat Cummins did, however, speak about the topic at hand .

ICC Champions Trophy 2025: India rest & reset ahead of New Zealand clash

DUBAI: He may not have taken a five-wicket haul or scored a fifty so far, but Axar Patel has played a huge role in both India’s wins in the 2025 ICC Champions Trophy at the Dubai International Stadium so far.In the first game against Bangladesh, Axar was on a hat-trick straight away when he was introduced into the attack in the ninth over as he had Tanzid Hasan and Mushfiqur Rahim out caught behind. Axar’s twin strikes left Bangladesh limping at 35 for five, and although they recovered to post 228, India comfortably won by six wickets. On Sunday, against Pakistan, it was Axar’s electric fielding that made the difference.Executing a stunning direct hit from close range- a quick pick-up followed by a bullet throw, the left-arm spinner caught Imam-ul-Haq short of his crease, as the batter perished while attempting a quick single off Kuldeep Yadav to mid-on. Making his first ODI appearance since the 2023 ODI World Cup, Imam was dismissed for 10 off 23 balls.Reflecting on the moment of his brilliant direct hit in the 10th over of the Pakistan innings, Axar revealed that he had visualized the dismissal even before the delivery, anticipating that Imam-ul-Haq might attempt a risky run.“The ball before I was visualizing that he may look for a quick single, and I can pull off a direct hit. I was a few steps behind initially, but charged in quickly. The movement played out exactly as I expected and I was able to make a direct hit at the stumps. After it happened, I told myself that it was good that I visualized the ball before, so I was prepared for it,"" Axar Patel told ICC after the match.“When I came onto bowl in the powerplay, he had taken a single through mid-off where Harshit Rana was fielding. So, I thought that it must be in his plans, and whatever videos I had seen of him, he was always stepping out to take quick singles against spinners. So, I had this scenario in mind, and when the moment came, I was ready,"" Axar added.Later in the 49th over, Axar showed off his classy fielding skills again when he fired in a superb throw from deep mid-wicket to run out Haris Rauf while he was going for two runs. It wasn’t a surprise, therefore, when Axar, who also took a sharp catch to dismiss Saud Shakeel off Hardik Pandya, won the ‘Best Fielder of the Match’ medal in the Indian dressing room, which was presented to him by ‘Mr ICC,’ former India opener Shuikhar Dhawan , who was invited to do the honours.During the medal-giving ceremony, Indian cricket team fielding coach T Dilip praised the players, especially Axar, for their effort in the field and their ‘five direct hits today’. “Good fielding unit is like a Formula One pit crew. Why? Which makes split-second decisions and there is no hesitation. And that’s what exactly we did with those two run outs, crucial run outs at the important juncture of a match. Well done,"" Dilip said in a video posted by the BCCI.Axar has sizzled with his fielding brilliance on many occasions previously too. In the T20 World Cup last year, he pulled off a spectacular catch at deep square leg with his with non-dominant right hand to dismiss Mitchell Marsh off Kuldeep Yadav’s bowling, in India’s 24-run win over Australia in a crucial Super Eights clash ay the Daren Sammy National Cricket Stadium in St Lucia. Axar’s stunning, football goalkeeper-like stunt was hailed as the ‘catch of the tournament.’In Nov last year, he took a breathtaking catch to send back David Miller in the third T20I against South Africa at the SuperSport Park in Centurion.After Miller pulled a short delivery from Hardik Pandya to deep mid-wicket, Axar, with the ball going well over his head, quickly judged the height of the ball and timed his jump perfectly to pull off a sensational grab.In the post-match presentation after India's six-wicket win over Pakistan, Indian captain Rohit Sharma jokingly pledged to compensate Axar for his dropped catch at sli during the Bangladesh match, which denied Axar his hat-trick, by taking the spinner out for dinner. Had Rohit successfully caught the ball, the 31-year-old would have become only the second player in Champions Trophy history to record a hat-trick. Later Axar came up with a social media post where he playfully reminded Rohit about his dinner promise. ""Wickets in the bag, win on the board… @ImRo45 Dinner pending hai,"" Axar wrote on X.""We have a six-day break. I think we have qualified as well. So, I think now I will have a chance to ask him for my dinner,"" Axar said while speaking to the ICC.So far, Axar has taken three wickets in two matches@ an economy rate of 4.84 in the Champions Trophy, returning figures of 2-43 in nine overs against Bangladesh and 1-49 in 10 overs against Pakistan. Besides his bowling and batting at No 5, Team India will bank majorly on Axar’s magical fielding to win them their first Champions Trophy since 2013.Realizing his growing potential, the selectors gave Axar the vice-captaincy in the T20 format. The day is not far when Axar, now playing alongside his senior left-arm spin allrounder colleague Ravindra Jadeja, could be in for a bigger role in India’s ODI team too in the future.","Axar Patel has played a huge role in both India’s wins in the 2025 ICC Champions Trophy at the Dubai International Stadium. The left-arm spinner caught Imam-ul- Haq short of his crease, as the batter perished while attempting a quick single off Kuldeep Yadav to mid-on. He also took a sharp catch to dismiss Saud Shakeel off Hardik Pandya.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118583821,imgsize-27862,width-400,resizemode-4/118583821.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Former India opener and Mumbai cricket stalwart Wasim Jaffer believes Virat Kohli has at least three to four more years of cricket left in him and is well on course to surpass Sachin Tendulkar ’s record of 100 international centuries. The 36-year-old Kohli currently boasts 82 international centuries across formats, with his most recent ton coming in India’s dominant six-wicket win over Pakistan in the Champions Trophy in Dubai.""As a cricket fan you want to see Virat as much as you can. With the form he was in (against Pakistan), nobody wants to see him get out. When he makes runs everybody is happy, and I am sure everyone wants Virat to play for 3-4 more years and break all records,"" Jaffer said on Wednesday.""The century record is one that looks like Virat is going to break. When Sachin Tendulkar made 100 centuries it looked it will never be broken but the way Virat made runs since 2010 it looks he will break that impossible thing. If Virat breaks that Sachin Tendulkar will also be very happy,"" he added.Jaffer also lauded Shubman Gill but emphasised that comparing him to Kohli would be unfair.""It will be unfair on Shubman to judge him with Virat Kohli, Shubman is making his own road. He is playing terrific cricket. In England series, he was man-of-the-series, he made a good start to the Champions Trophy and I hope he will continue because everybody has expectations from him. He and the likes of Yashasvi Jaiswal are going to take Indian batting forward.""It is nice to watch the way he is playing cricket,"" he said.Former South Africa opener Herschelle Gibbs shared Jaffer’s sentiments, stating that Kohli still has plenty of cricket left in him.""I think its long time because of his (Kohli's) fitness and his hunger, he can go for at least another 4 years. He is in the same boat like AB de Villiers, AB might have retired a bit too early but there were never issues with their fitness and hunger. Virat's hunger for runs in unbelievable,"" Gibbs said.""The way he copes pressure specially while chasing in ODI cricket is phenomenal.""Gibbs said India are favourites to win the Champions Trophy and also called Gill a ""special player"".""Shubman is a special talent, he is technically correct and bit more talented,"" he said.""India are obviously the favourites, they look very strong.

NEW DELHI: Opener Ibrahim Zadran smashed a sensational 177 off 146 balls as Afghanistan posted a commanding 325 for seven in their crucial Champions Trophy clash against England on Wednesday. His innings, laced with 12 boundaries and six sixes, anchored Afghanistan’s recovery after a shaky start.Zadran found strong allies in skipper Hashmatullah Shahidi (40 off 67, 3x4), with whom he stitched a vital 103-run fourth-wicket stand, and Azmatullah Omarzai (41 off 31), adding another crucial 72 runs for the fifth wicket. Later, he accelerated further, plundering 111 runs for the sixth wicket alongside Mohammad Nabi (40 off 24), putting England under immense pressure.With both teams fighting to stay in contention for the semifinals, Afghanistan’s innings initially wobbled. Opting to bat first, they were rattled early by Jofra Archer (3/64), who removed Rahmanullah Gurbaz (dragged onto stumps), Sediqullah Atal (lbw), and Rahmat Shah (caught at square leg) inside the powerplay, reducing them to 37/3.Zadran began cautiously but shifted gears after reaching his fifty off 65 balls. He launched Jamie Overton for consecutive boundaries before losing Shahidi to Adil Rashid’s sharp leg-spin. However, he found support in Omarzai, and the duo counterattacked to put England on the back foot.Despite a knee injury limiting Mark Wood’s bowling to eight overs, England struggled to contain Zadran. He brought up his sixth ODI century off 106 balls and then tore into Overton and Archer, hammering multiple boundaries to race past 150.The onslaught continued as he and Nabi scored at over 11 runs an over in the final 10 overs, punishing England’s tiring attack. Afghanistan added 113 runs in the last phase before Zadran eventually fell to Liam Livingstone in the final over.Livingstone, however, later left the field with an apparent hamstring issue, adding to England’s concerns in this high-stakes encounter.",Ibrahim Zadran smashes 177 off 146 balls as Afghanistan post 325 for seven.

ICC Champions Trophy 2025: India rest & reset ahead of New Zealand clash

NEW DELHI: ICC Hall of Famer Ricky Ponting expressed confidence in Australia 's performance despite the absence of star pace trio Pat Cummins Mitchell Starc and Josh Hazelwood .During The ICC Review, the former Australian captain expressed optimism about the bowling unit gaining crucial tournament experience, particularly in their challenging match against England.""That could be really good for a team going forward. I was a little bit worried. But even though they had some injuries, every time Australia puts a team on the park, you know they're going to be very competitive,"" Ponting said as quoted by the ICC.""Winning a game like that when ... it might've been 75-25 probably in England's favour going into the second innings, to be able to pull off a win like that. That's the sort of thing at the start of a tournament that can do wonders for a team,"" the former Australian skipper added.Australia began their ICC Champions Trophy 2025 campaign with an extraordinary performance, featuring Josh Inglis 's century and crucial partnerships with Alex Carey and Glenn Maxwell, successfully chasing 352 runs against England at Lahore on Sunday, with five wickets remaining.This chase established multiple records: the highest in ICC ODI events, surpassing Pakistan's 345 against Sri Lanka at the 2023 Men's Cricket World Cup; the highest total in ICC Champions Trophy history; Australia's second-highest ODI chase; their highest against England; and the highest ODI chase on Pakistan soil.Spencer Johnson , Nathan Ellis and Ben Dwarshuis are currently replacing Cummins, Starc and Hazelwood in this tournament. While Johnson and Ellis went without wickets, conceding 105 runs in 17 overs combined, Dwarshuis secured 3/66 in his 10 overs.Ponting particularly commended Josh Inglis's performance, whose unbeaten 120 from 86 deliveries was instrumental in Australia's successful chase.""Inglis was absolutely magnificent.

On March 16, they will meet Newcastle again at Wembley in the League Cup final. Mikel Arteta , the manager of Arsenal, had declared that his team would give up the title ""over my dead body"".Although the Gunners still have a match against Liverpool, Arteta could have to concede that the City Ground draw was the last straw for Arsenal's hopes of winning a first championship since 2004.At the City Ground, the toothless Gunners, who were without a known striker, only mustered one effort on goal, with Riccardo Calafiori striking the post in the first half.With just one victory in their previous five games, third-place Forest's unexpected bid for Champions League qualifying has also faltered.After recovering from an injury, Erling Haaland helped Manchester City defeat Tottenham and move into fourth place.Due to a knee injury sustained on February 15 against Newcastle, Haaland had missed City's previous two losses against Real Madrid and Liverpool.With the first-half victory in north London, the Norway star showed no signs of rust as City moved up one point above Chelsea, who were in fifth position.After a lackluster start to the season, Haaland silenced the doubters with his 28th goal in all competitions, 10 of which came in his past 11 games.This was a much-needed win for City, who had lost four of their previous six games in all competitions. They had a solid start but were fortunate to see Tottenham squander many second-half opportunities.After being sent off in the first half for his role in a disastrous Ipswich opener, Patrick Dorgu's humiliation was lessened when Harry Maguire's header gave Manchester United a hard-fought victory at Old Trafford.Maguire's header in the second half put a stop to United's three-game league losing streak and provided some respite following the club's announcement of a second round of layoffs on Monday.Even though Dorgu and goalkeeper Andre Onana made a terrible mistake that gave Jaden Philogene an early goal, Ruben Amorim managed to record just his fifth league victory as United's manager.Prior to Dorgu's night becoming worse, United had taken the lead through an own goal and an effort from Matthijs de Ligt. A VAR review later, the 20-year-old was sent out for a high challenge on Omari Hutchinson.Third-bottom Ipswich's hopes of surviving were dashed when Maguire headed in from a Bruno Fernandes corner after Philogene's cross crept in first-half stoppage time.After a 1-1 draw at Brentford, Jake O'Brien's debut goal for Everton extended their winning streak to seven league games.Brentford took the lead in first-half stoppage time thanks to Yoane Wissa's 13th goal of the season, but O'Brien tied the score in the 77th minute.",Liverpool beat Newcastle 2-0 to move 13 points clear of second-place Arsenal.

It might have something to do with the 27-year-old's catchphrase 'responsibility' which has him turning inward.Rublev is back at the Dubai Duty Free tennis championships , where he was defaulted 12 months ago, following an animated rant at a lines judge at the fag end of the semifinals. The Russian, known as much for his mercurial temper as for his penchant for self-harm, beating himself with his racket and leaving his hands and legs bloodied, spoke about his struggles with burnout and depression.""I was completely lost. I was thinking what's the purpose of living,"" said Rublev, who has battled in the dark for a few years now. ""The thing is when it happens for a few months, you still have patience (that you can overcome), but when it goes on for years you feel you cannot take it anymore.""It's like a pain,"" he said, pointing at his arm. ""It starts to grow more and more, and you want to cut the arm.""Rublev, who fell in the first round of the Australian Open , won his 17th career title in Doha last week. ""I was taking antidepressants, but after one year of taking antidepressants, I realized that in the beginning you feel a bit better, then nothing afterwards,"" he said. ""After some time I realized that while it's not getting worse, something was weird. I didn't like that feeling so I stopped taking the medication.""With the help of his charismatic compatriot Marat Safin , a former World No. 1, Rublev started finding his way back. ""Marat made me understand myself, that was a bit of a restart from the bottom. From there, little by little, I started to move in a better direction,"" he said, adding, ""I'm not in a good or a bad place (now), but I'm not feeling any more stress, I'm not feeling anxious, I'm not having depression. I'm just neutral. Not happy, not bad, but I have found a base and that's a beginning.""The main thing is to be honest with yourself,"" the World No. 9 said. ""All of us think that we (may not be) honest with people, but with ourselves we are honest. This is a huge lie because most people are not even honest with themselves. I was the same. I (thought) I have no problem saying if I'm wrong, if I'm right, if I made a mistake.""I was lying to myself about many things. I didn't even want to understand or notice it. You need someone who can make you see yourself in an honest way.""""People put masks on, they make excuses for that, I'm doing that because someone hurt me or I don't want them to see the real me.,"" he said, ""They are already lying, running away from the problem, finding an excuse. They don't want to face themselves. The first thing is to be honest with yourself, then start to be more aware.""This search for his true self is stirred by a one-word reminder - responsibility -which Rublev writes on his shoes. Every time he looks down the word stares back at him. ""I'm putting that word there to remind myself that I'm the one, it's not because of anything or anyone. If something bad or good happens to me, it's not because of luck but because I made a mistake (or did something right). You cannot blame anything or anyone, this is a reminder to myself not to complain.""",Andrey Rublev talks about his struggles with burnout and depression.

Teen sensation Mirra Andreeva sets sight on top-5 finish this season,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/top-stories/teen-sensation-mirra-andreeva-sets-sight-on-top-5-finish-this-season/articleshow/118521390.cms,"DUBAI: Mirra Andreeva acts her age at times, like when she's talking shop, but in the rectangle, sentineling the lines, she flaunts a steel that belies her years.The 17-year-old, who on Saturday claimed the Dubai Duty-Free tennis championship with a 7-6 (1), 6-1 win over Clara Tauson , is the youngest winner of a WTA 1000 title . Andreeva, the only teenager in the top-100 of the rankings, was relentless in her attitude and approach even if her tennis at times was weary.The Russian noted that confidence is easy to wear when things are going your way. ""The ball is flying, you hit a lot of winners,"" she said. ""The hardest part is to be positive, to be there (in the moment) 100 per cent mentally, when things are not going your way.""For much of her near two-hours on court against the in-form Tauson, the Russian tried but couldn't produce the tennis that saw her put out three Grand Slam champions - Marketa Vondrousova, Iga Swiatek and Elena Rybakina - in a week. ""I told myself, you can either let that negativity come into your head or you can choose to fight for every point,"" Andreeva said. ""I've been listening to a lot of LeBron James interviews. He said it's easy to be confident and to play good when everything goes your way. What makes you a champion is when you're giving your best when you don't feel great. That's what I tried to do in the final.""Andreeva's goal for the 2025 season was to break into the top-10, now that she has debuted in the top tier at No.9 this week, the teenager promptly raised the bar.""The higher your ranking is, the slower the climb (becomes) because the difference in the points is very little,"" she said. ""If I win another tournament, I'm going to be top-eight maybe. If I win another tournament, I can still be top eight. It's going to be hard to enter the Top-five. That is the goal I'm going to set for myself, to be Top-five by the end of the year.""When asked what she'd do with this week's earnings of $597,000, Andreeva shrugged. She felt she had everything she needed.""I don't know what I want, I feel like I have everything. I won the tournament. I've already reached the goal that I had set for myself for the end of the year,"" she said, adding, ""My family is traveling with me. I have a great team. I feel happy, and this is all I need.""A couple of minutes later she was asked if she likes to shop, Andreeva's face mirrored a light bulb.""Yes, of course I like shopping, it doesn't matter what I buy, just as long as I buy something, I already feel good. It can be jewelry, a pair of jeans, socks, cap… As long as I buy something, I feel like the day is successful,"" Andreeva said, noting that her father Alexander doesn't like to shop. ""I like to buy something, even something from the grocery store.""It's easy to forget Andreeva's age when she's on the tennis court, serving big and painting the lines with her groundstrokes. Just as well that she doesn't hold back when she's not aiming for the lines.","Mirra Andreeva is the youngest winner of a WTA 1000 title. The 17-year-old Russian beat Clara Tauson 7-6 (1), 6-1 in the Dubai Duty-Free final.

DUBAI: Alex de Minaur put it simply. In modern-day tennis, where power brings glory, the 26-year-old has had to 'adapt or die'.De Minaur, the second seed in the Dubai Duty Free tennis championships - a 500 Series event for the men which gets underway on Monday - is one of five men in the ATP's top25, who stands at 6 ft (183 cms), the shortest in the top-tier of the sport.The Aussie, ranked eighth in the world, broke into the top-10 for the first time last Jan, and has spent most of the last 14 months in that elite bracket.De Minaur, who opens against the 6-ft-6-in veteran Marin Cilic in the first round here, shares a 2-2 head-to-head record with the 36-year-old Croat. ""I'm looking forward to a tough first-round match - a veteran player with a lot of experience, very dangerous, especially on these types of courts. I'm expecting a battle,"" he said.De Minaur, who took Carlos Alcaraz the distance in the final at Rotterdam in early Feb, likes how he has started the year.""I'm happy, I have played some great tennis. I've lost to Jannik (Sinner), to Carlos (Alcaraz) and now I lost to Andrey (Rublev in Doha last week) after having a match point, the last one stings a little bit because I feel like I had my chances. It's all about putting myself in those situations, giving myself the opportunity.""De Minaur said, ""People are hitting the ball with a lot more force (today). You're losing a little bit of that variety that you had with the likes of Roger (Federer). It feels like everything's a lot more fast-paced, because of the tech, racquets, balls… Conditions are slower, everyone is hitting the ball so much harder.""Nice guy De Minaur, nicknamed 'Demon', found inspiration in where he finished last year, inside the top-10 and making the season-ending field in Turin.Mirra Andreeva became the youngest at 17 years to clinch a WTA 1000 title since its inception 16 years ago.

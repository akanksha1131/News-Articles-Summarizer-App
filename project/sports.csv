MUMBAI: So nervous was Ashwani Kumar before making his IPL debut for the Mumbai Indians against the Kolkata Knight Riders on Monday night that he couldn’t even have his lunch, preferring to just have a banana instead.A few hours later, the 23-year-old left-arm pacer dazzled his way into the limelight under the lights at the Wankhede Stadium, and became one of the most googled names in India. Enjoying the best-ever debut by an Indian bowler in the history of the IPL, the young turk from Punjab dismantled KKR’s batting line-up, taking four for 24 in a sensational three-over spell that broke the back of KKR.Inspired by Ashwini’s dream initiation into the IPL, MI, after suffering defeats in their first two matches, finally got their campaign going, as the hosts logged their first win of IPL-2025 in style, thrashing KKR by eight wickets with 43 balls remaining in the match.Playing their first match at home this season, the five-time IPL champs thus enjoyed a sweet homecoming.After asking KKR to take first strike, MI shot out the defending IPL champs for 116 in just 16.2 overs. Ashwini , of course, capitalized on early strikes by MI’s senior pacers Deepak Chahar ( two for 19 in two) and Trent Boult (1-23 in four overs), while the hosts also thrived on some electric fielding by Naman Dhir, who took three catches, the last one, a diving effort to pouch Harshit Rana (4) off Puthur, being a gem.MI than coasted home by the 13th over itself, as their new recruit, South African opener Ryan Rickelton (62 not out, 41b, 4x4, 5x6) tore into the KKJR attack, while Suryakumar Yadav (29 not out, 9b, 3x4, 2x6) finished off the game in trademark style, scooping an Andre Russell delivery over the ‘keeper’s head for a six. Never mind that their former captain Rohit Sharma (13) failed again.Missing out on his lunch, Ashwani chose to feast on KKR’s batsmen instead, scalping the opposition captain Ajinkya Rahane (11) with his first ball in the IPL, before following up with the wickets of Rinku Singh (17), Manish Pandey (19) and Andre Russell (5) to leave a 30,000 home crowd, making a deafening noise by now, delirious.Flashing an infectious smile after his first-match heroics, Ashwani, who hails from a small town called jhanjeri, near Chandigarh, revealed that it was his captain Hardik Pandya’s advice to bowl a sort of a ‘bodyline’ that did the trick for him. “Hardik bhai told me to bowl short and to bowl at the body and that led to a wicket. In my village, everyone would be watching. They were just waiting for my debut, and by God's grace, I got an opportunity tonight and did well.”Introduced into the attack in the fourth over, the Punjab quick struck gold with his first ball in the IPL as Rahane sliced a full and wide delivery to Tilak Varma, who nearly made a mess of the catch before recovering well to pouch the ball with his left hand. He then had Rinku caught at deep point by Naman Dhir.Turning his IPL debut into a fairytale story, he unleashed a ’jaffa’, as Pandey was bowled neck and crop by a back-of-length delivery that cut him into half, leaving him caught at the crease before hitting the top of leg stump.For his fourth wicket , the talented rookie, after setting up Russell with a few short balls, produced a slightly fuller ball that Russell went to dispatch into the crowd, but only ended up hearing the ‘death rattle.’Only three bowlers have enjoyed a better IPL debut than Ashwani, with Alzarri Joseph (6-12 for MI vs SRH in 2019) heading the list. Ashwani has only played four senior T20 matches prior to his IPL debut, in addition to two Ranji Trophy and four List A matches for Punjab.This is the first time in his career that Ashwani picked up a four-wicket haul in a match. His previous-best was three for 37 in List A cricket and one for 19 in T20 cricket.The seamer has a really good and a deceptive bouncer. Known for his pace variations, Ashwani also has very good wide yorker and impressed the MI talent scouts in the Sher-E-Punjab T20 Trophy last year, where he closed out plenty of matches with his effective death bowling.Clearly, MI’s talent scouts are doing something right, though credit must also be given to MI’s bowling coach-former India bowling coach Paras Mhambrey for ensuring a talent like Ashwani was provided this big stage early in his promising career.If it was left-arm spinner Vignesh Puthur who made an impressive debut in the opening match against Chennai Super Kings, taking three for 32 in four overs, it was Ashwini’s turn to zoom into the limelight at the Wankhede.Playing at the Wankhede for the first time in MI colours, Boult gave the hosts the perfect start when he sent KKR opener Sunil Narine packing for a duck with a signature full delivery, just the fourth ball of the match.Chahar accounted for Quinton de Kock (1), who was well-caught by a leaping Ashwani at mid-off in the second over, and Venkatesh Iyer (edged behind an upper-cut. Tottering at 45 for five in seven overs, KKR were saved the embarrassment of being bowled out under 100 purely due to the cameos of local boy Angkrish Raghuvanshi (26, 16b, 3x4, 1x6) and Ramandeep Singh (22, 12b, 1x4, 2x6).",Ashwani Kumar makes IPL debut for Mumbai Indians against Kolkata Knight Riders.

LUCKNOW: Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) will be eyeing their first victory at home this season when they take on Punjab Kings (PBKS) at the Ekana International Stadium in Lucknow on Tuesday.Skipper Rishabh Pant will be keen to make his presence felt after LSG suffered a narrow one-wicket defeat in their season’s opener against Delhi Capitals in Vizag. However, LSG made a strong comeback with an impressive five-wicket victory over Sunrisers Hyderabad in the second away outing, thanks to Nicholas Pooran (70), Mitchell Marsh (55), and Shardul Thakur (4/34), who excelled with his impressive bowling.LSG’s top-order was explosive, with Mitchell Marsh and Nicholas Pooran creating a strong foundation for the team. Aiden Markram, like Pant, did not perform well and will be hoping to make amends.Pant, who became the most expensive player in the IPL auction last year, will be determined to justify his hefty Rs 27 crore price tag after low returns as a batter in the first two outings. A good innings in front of the home crowd will go a long way towards easing some of the pressure.Mention should also be made of Abdul Samad, who scored an eight-ball 22 against SRH, while Shardul Thakur, who replaced Mohsin Khan, has done well with the ball. LSG have strategically opted for three spinners on the slow Ekana pitch and will look to Ravi Bishnoi to deliver.Seasoned leg-spinner Yuzvendra Chahal will be the leader of the spin attack for Punjab, with Glenn Maxwell also expected to roll his arm over. This will also be an interesting clash between the most expensive and second-most expensive players in IPL history.In contrast to Pant’s struggles, Shreyas Iyer, who was roped in for Rs 26.75 cr, led from the front with a match-winning 97 not out of 42 deliveries against Gujarat Titans.

Overcoming challenges and changing Mindset

A tough IPL and a fitting T20 farewell

A career of highs and lows: Rohit Sharma's journey

Bombay Sports Exchange Episode 1: Interview with Sanjog Gupta, CEO (Sports) at JioStar

NEW DELHI: Reflecting on India's incredible run in ICC tournaments, Rohit Sharma highlighted the team’s resilience over the past nine months, navigating cricket’s highs and lows. Under his leadership, India won the ICC Champions Trophy and the T20 World Cup , but the only blemish was the heartbreaking defeat to Australia in the 2023 ODI World Cup final.""Look at what this team has achieved in this big three tournaments. After playing the tournament like that and getting defeated only once, and that too in a final (2023 ODI World Cup),"" Rohit said in a video posted by Mumbai Indians on their X (formerly Twitter) handle. ""But imagine if we had won that as well to go undefeated in three ICC tournaments is crazy, never heard of, but I will take this, 23 wins in 24 games is unheard of. It looks very nice from the outside, but the team has gone through a lot of ups and downs.""We had some really tough times as well, but that is when you've got to celebrate. If you do things like this, you've got to celebrate. I feel that all the people who played these three tournaments deserve respect.""Rohit credited India’s success to the shift in mindset that began after their semifinal exit in the 2022 T20 World Cup in Australia. The team focused on clarity, fearless cricket, and collective responsibility.""But thereafter, we made a lot of things clear with the players that this is what we expect from you, and this is how we want you to play. So there was a lot of clarity, a lot of conversations with the players to perform,"" he added.""There needs to be freedom amongst the group so that they go out and play without any fear. There were a few lows, a few series that we lost, but we never panicked and we never went away from our thought process. When you are building a squad, the first thing that you need to put in front of you is what the team want. Where did we lack in the previous series, previous tournaments? Why did we not get the results?""Interestingly, Rohit's remarks came on the day when BCCI’s top brass was set to discuss India's future roadmap, though the meeting was later postponed.The journey was not without setbacks. In between the three ICC tournaments, India lost a rare home Test series to New Zealand and struggled in Australia. But Rohit saw these challenges as learning experiences.""These nine months are a perfect example of how life is -- it’s always going to be up and down. Any sportsman going through a low wants to fight back, bounce back, and turn things around. And that’s exactly what we did,"" he reflected.Rohit also opened up about his disappointing 2024 IPL season, where Mumbai Indians finished last. Despite the setback, he remained focused on the bigger picture -- ending his T20I career on a high.He continued, ""It (2024 IPL) was a low for the team, and I think we didn't play our best cricket also, and there were so many things after IPL to look forward to.""""I knew there was a World Cup coming up and I had to shift my focus to the World Cup, knowing that this is going to be my last T20 World Cup. So I really wanted to make it count, and obviously I knew without the help of other players it is not going to be possible. So we just got around as a group, and there was a lot of collective performance from everyone throughout the tournament,"" he said.India went on to defeat South Africa by 7 runs in Barbados, securing the T20 World Cup title.""My career for 17-18 years has always been up and down, and these nine months were no different,"" Rohit admitted.Speaking about his journey with Mumbai Indians, he acknowledged the changes over the years, adding, ""Obviously, since the time I started till now lot of things have changed because I used to bat middle-order then, now I am opening the batting. I was captain then (MI), but now I am not the captain. There were a few teammates with whom I won championships, they are not there, they are in the coaching role now.""So, the roles have changed, a lot of things have changed but the mindset has not changed. What I want to do for this team has not changed, just to go out there and win games and trophies, that is what MI is known for all these years.""","Rohit Sharma reflects on India's incredible run in ICC tournaments.

Lionel Messi made an impressive return from injury, scoring within two minutes of coming on as a substitute in Inter Miami 's 2-1 victory over the Philadelphia Union on Saturday.The Argentine star had been sidelined with an adductor strain, which caused him to miss Argentina's World Cup qualifiers during the international break. His last appearance was in Miami's 2-1 win against Atlanta on March 16.The scoring began when Finnish winger Robert Taylor found the net in the 23rd minute. The goal came after Jordi Alba's run down the left flank, with Benjamin Cremaschi providing the final low pass to Taylor.Messi entered the game in the 55th minute under coach Javier Mascherano's direction. His former Barcelona teammate Luis Suarez set him up on the right side, where Messi created space before scoring with a low right-footed shot into the far corner.Philadelphia reduced the deficit in the 80th minute through Daniel Gazdag. The Hungarian midfielder controlled Quinn Sullivan's cross from the right before finishing with a precise shot.Inter Miami remains undefeated and leads the Eastern Conference with four wins in their first five matches of the season.The team faces a challenging schedule ahead, starting with a CONCACAF Champions Cup quarter-final first leg against LAFC in Los Angeles on Wednesday. They then host Toronto the following Sunday before returning to Los Angeles for the second leg.""We didn't want to risk him from the start because we thought he might be at risk playing the whole game, but we did want him to get some minutes,"" said the Argentine coach.""The plan is that he can recover and travel to Los Angeles. He played today because he was fine. Maybe he wasn't ready for the full 90 minutes but it was good for him to play 45 minutes. If nothing unusual happens the plan is for him to travel.""In other MLS action, Atlanta United secured a thrilling 4-3 victory over New York City FC.

Bombay Sports Exchange Episode 1: Interview with Sanjog Gupta, CEO (Sports) at JioStar

NEW DELHI: A high-voltage Indian Premier League (IPL) clash between Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) and Chennai Super Kings ( CSK ) saw tempers flare, with Virat Kohli and Khaleel Ahmed at the center of an intense face-off.The heated moment came after RCB broke their 17-year jinx at Chepauk with a commanding 50-run victory over CSK.The spark was ignited during RCB’s innings when Khaleel Ahmed bowled a sharp bouncer to Kohli, who missed the delivery.The CSK pacer followed through aggressively, getting uncomfortably close and giving a fierce stare at Kohli. The RCB batter did not take kindly to it.However, the real drama unfolded after the match during the customary handshake.Kohli, who scored 31 off 30 balls, was visibly agitated when Khaleel approached him -- possibly to extend a peace offering.While shaking his hand, Kohli shoved the pacer away, making his frustration evident.Watch:Standing nearby, MS Dhoni watched the incident unfold with his signature calm demeanor, but the exchange was already caught on camera, sparking discussions among fans.Later, Kohli was seen having a light-hearted chat with Ravindra Jadeja before his demeanour suddenly changed upon noticing Khaleel Ahmed approaching him.His aggressive reaction was caught on camera, showcasing an intense exchange. However, the heated moment eventually cooled down, ending with both players shaking hands in a show of sportsmanship.Earlier in the game, RCB posted a solid 196/7, thanks to a gritty 51 off 32 by Rajat Patidar and a late cameo from Tim David (22 not out off 8).Despite a brisk start by Phil Salt (32 off 16) and Devdutt Padikkal (27 off 14), the innings stumbled in the middle overs before Patidar and David provided the finishing touches.CSK’s chase faltered early as Josh Hazlewood (3/21) and Yash Dayal (2/18) rattled their top order, leaving them at 52/4.Rachin Ravindra (41 off 31) and MS Dhoni (30 not out off 16) fought back, but it wasn’t enough as CSK fell short, finishing at 146/8.While RCB celebrated a historic win, Kohli’s fiery moment ensured that the drama didn’t end with the match.READ ALSO: MS Dhoni becomes CSK’s highest run-scorer in IPL history",Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) beat Chennai Super Kings (CSK) by 50 runs.

NEW DELHI: Chennai Super Kings (CSK) head coach Stephen Fleming was visibly frustrated with a journalist during the post-match press conference following his team's loss to Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) on Friday. The former New Zealand captain reacted strongly when the journalist compared CSK's style of play to other teams, dismissing the question as ""silly.""The match marked CSK’s first defeat of the season, with RCB securing their first victory at Chepauk since 2008, winning by 50 runs.Tensions flared in the press conference when Fleming confronted the journalist over the criticism of CSK’s approach.: ""In the first game, you chased 156 in almost 20 overs. Today, you scored 146. I know this is your way of playing cricket, but do you think it's kind of getting outdated?"": ""What do you mean by my way of playing? You talk about firepower. We have got firepower all the way through. I don't understand this question. Just because we don't swing from ball No.1 and have some luck go our way, just see at the end, who wins it. It is a positive brand of cricket. Don't discount us."": ""I am not discounting you."": ""You sort of are. Silly question.""Addressing the notion of ""home advantage,"" Fleming argued that Chepauk no longer provides CSK with a clear edge, as the team has struggled to read the pitch consistently.""Well, as we've been telling you for a number of years, there was no home advantage at Chepauk. We've won away from home a couple of times. And we haven't been able to read... we've been really honest with you,"" Fleming said in the post-match press conference.""We haven't been able to read the wickets here in the last couple of years. So, it's not new. We are trying to come to grips each day with what we get, and we don't know. It's not the Chepauk [of old] where you can just go in and play four spinners. We're having to work really hard to try and understand what the nature of each pitch is, and it's quite different,"" he added.",Chennai Super Kings (CSK) lost to Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) on Friday.

His heroics paved the way for Mumbai Indians' emphatic eight-wicket victory at the Wankhede Stadium on Sunday.The 23-year-old left-arm pacer from Jhanjeri, near Chandigarh, carved his name into IPL history, becoming the first Indian bowler to take four wickets on debut. His remarkable spell played a crucial role in bundling out KKR to a mere 116 in 16.2 overs.Ashwani's debut heroics place him in an elite list of IPL debutants, alongside Alzarri Joseph (6/12) and Andrew Tye (5/17), reinforcing his potential as a future match-winner.With this dominant win, Mumbai Indians not only strengthened their campaign but also introduced a promising left-arm pace sensation in Ashwani Kumar. As the tournament unfolds, all eyes will be on this young pacer, who has already made a lasting impact on the grand stage.KKR’s innings started on a disastrous note as Sunil Narine was bowled for a duck by Trent Boult in the very first over. The collapse continued when Quinton de Kock (1) followed in the next over, caught by Ashwani off Deepak Chahar.With KKR reeling at 2/2, skipper Ajinkya Rahane (11) attempted to stabilise the innings but fell victim to Ashwani, edging one to Tilak Varma at deep backward point. While Angkrish Raghuvanshi (26 off 16) showed some promise with fluent stroke play, he too perished, courtesy of Hardik Pandya (1/10). KKR's powerplay ended at 41/4, leaving them in a dire situation.Ashwani continued his carnage, striking in the 10th over by dismissing Rinku Singh (17), who holed out to Naman Dhir at deep point. Two deliveries later, the debutant bowled Manish Pandey (19) with a beauty.KKR's last hope, Andre Russell (5), also succumbed to Ashwani’s brilliance, clean bowled as he attempted an aggressive shot.With Ashwani leading the attack, supported by Chahar (2/19), Boult (1/23), Pandya (1/10), and Vignesh Puthur (1/10), KKR’s innings never found momentum. They were eventually bowled out for 116 in 16.2 overs.Chasing a modest 117, Mumbai Indians openers Rohit Sharma (13 off 12) and Ryan Rickelton (62 off 41)* provided a solid start. While Rohit fell to Andre Russell (2/32) in the sixth over, Rickelton played a sublime knock, finding gaps with ease and rotating the strike effectively.Will Jacks (16 off 17) was Russell’s second victim, but by then, Mumbai Indians were firmly in control at 91/2 in 10.4 overs.

‘One defeat cannot define who Brazil are’

Chennai: With the World Cup little over a year away, Brazil find themselves in a not-so-ideal situation. The five-time champions, often expected to cruise through the qualifiers, are huffing and puffing on their way to the football extravaganza.The South American heavyweights are terribly low on morale after enduring their heaviest defeat in WC qualifying history, a 1-4 drubbing at the hands of bitter rivals and defending champions Argentina recently. Making matters worse, Brazil are without a head coach following the ouster of Dorival Jr and have gone back to square one.World Cup winners Dunga and Gilberto Silva , who know a thing or two about dazzling for Brazil on the global stage, remarked that the national federation should have finalised the manager for the World Cup a long time ago. “We have a lot of good coaches in Brazil, but here is the problem. We have one year to go for the WC and we are still looking for a coach. Postponing things might be the biggest problem. You start winning the World Cup off the field,” said Dunga, who is in Chennai for the Brazil Legends-India All Stars match and Football Plus summit.The seasoned Carlo Ancelotti, currently under contract at La Liga giants Real Madrid, has been heavily linked with the Brazil top job. “Sometimes, people take decisions based on emotions. This is not the solution. Sometimes, we have to be in this kind of situation, which is very disappointing. We are going to look for a manager one year before the start of the competition. This makes the work of the players even harder (tougher). I hope that whoever they (federation) decide, we start to play well again,” said Gilberto.Brazil have been let down by the indifferent international form of potential game-changers Vinicius Jr and Raphinha, players who have been delivering at club level.On why they are struggling to replicate their club form playing for the country, Gilberto said: “There is a massive difference between club and country. In a club, you are there every day, training with your colleagues and coach. In the national team, you may have the opportunity to spend time with your colleagues and manager about six times a year. It is not enough. In the short time, the players have to do as much as they can to maintain a high level.”The 2002 WC-winning member, who made the defensive midfielder’s position his own, added: “When you are in the national team of any country, there is massive pressure. When you are in Brazil, people do not understand how high the pressure is, how difficult it is to play under pressure. We, as supporters of the Brazil team, put pressure on everyone. We have been there, so we know the difficulties. We have to support them.”Dunga stressed that patience is key when trying to create a world-beating unit, something that Brazil have not managed to construct over the last 20 years. “We have to understand how hard it is to be a champion. We had a very strong group and it takes time to build that. It takes time to build champions and legends,” said Dunga, a 1994 WC winner.“Brazil struggled between 1970 and 1994, they did not win (the WC) for many years. Talent and technique are important, but only those are not enough to become a champion. It is important to have a ‘team’, which understands what discipline and sacrifice are. Sometimes, one shot is all that is there for us to win,” added Dunga, who also served as Brazil chief coach.Gilberto emphasised that the recent thrashing against Argentina cannot be considered the end of the world for Brazil. “It does not matter when we win a couple of games. When we lose one game, it is a big story. While preparing for the 2010 World Cup, we beat Argentina 3-1. From time to time, these kinds of situations happen. One defeat cannot define what we are at the moment. We should have in mind what we are capable of,” said Gilberto.","Brazil are without a head coach following the ouster of Dorival Jr. World Cup winners Dunga and Gilberto Silva say the national federation should have finalised the manager a long time ago. The seasoned Carlo Ancelotti, currently under contract at La Liga giants Real Madrid, has been heavily linked with the Brazil top job.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-119791662,imgsize-52806,width-400,resizemode-4/119791662.jpg"

Barcelona secured a commanding 4-1 victory over Girona at the Olympic Stadium on Sunday, with Robert Lewandowski scoring twice to help his team move three points clear at the top of La Liga. The win came after Real Madrid had temporarily drawn level on points following their victory against Leganes on Saturday.Barcelona extended their unbeaten run to 20 matches this year, with goals coming from a Ladislav Krejci own goal, Lewandowski's double, and Ferran Torres's strike. Girona's Arnaut Danjuma managed to score an equalizer during the match.Lewandowski, who remains three goals ahead in Spain's golden boot race against Real Madrid's Kylian Mbappe, shared his thoughts on the victory: ""We played with patience, we had a plan and if we play with that plan we can always score a lot of goals and win the game.""The 36-year-old Polish striker expressed confidence about his future in the sport: ""I know a lot of people are talking about my age but... I want to play more years at the top level. I feel very good physically, I think looking at the stats there's no difference now to a few years ago.""Girona, currently sitting in 13th place, had previously beaten Barcelona twice last season but failed to replicate that form. Their coach Michel Sanchez acknowledged Barcelona's superiority: ""They were superior. There's a difference between the teams and that's the truth... Barcelona dream of titles every year.""Manager Hansi Flick rotated his squad with an upcoming Copa del Rey semi-final against Atletico Madrid in mind. The first half saw Barcelona dominating possession, with Lamine Yamal and Fermin Lopez providing attacking threats.A controversial moment arose when Barcelona appealed for a penalty after Fermin was brought down by Yaser Asprilla. While VAR showed contact inside the area, the referee ruled that Lopez had fouled Asprilla.Barcelona broke the deadlock before halftime when Yamal's free-kick was deflected into his own net by Krejci. Girona equalized through Danjuma early in the second half, but Lewandowski quickly restored Barcelona's lead with a clever finish.The Polish striker added his second goal after being set up by substitute Frenkie de Jong. Torres completed the scoring, while Yamal hit the crossbar in the closing stages.This performance marked the 20th time this season that Flick's team has scored four or more goals in 45 games, as they pursue a potential treble.Flick expressed his satisfaction with the team's attacking mentality: ""This is what I love about my team, they always want to score goals, it's always like that. This is the mentality and the attitude of the team and it's good, I think everyone loves it, you love it, the fans love it, the club loves it, and everyone is happy at the moment.""In other La Liga matches, Athletic Bilbao drew 0-0 with Osasuna at home, while Villarreal defeated Getafe 2-1 to close the gap on fourth place to six points.Real Betis continued their impressive form with a sixth consecutive victory, beating local rivals Sevilla 2-1 in a derby match.Valencia moved to 15th place after securing a 1-0 victory over Mallorca, putting them four points clear of the relegation zone.",Barcelona defeated Girona 4-1 at the Olympic Stadium on Sunday.

Sels heroics

Brighton, Mar 30, 2025 -Nottingham Forest reached the FA Cup semi-finals for the first time in 34 years as Belgian goalkeeper Matz Sels starred in a 4-3 penalty shoot-out win over Brighton on Saturday.After the quarter-final clash at the Amex Stadium finished 0-0 following extra-time, Sels took centre-stage to send Forest to Wembley.Sels saved spot-kicks from Jack Hinshelwood and Diego Gomez and, although Forest's Neco Williams blazed over, Ryan Yates held his nerve to stroke home the winner.Forest also needed shoot-outs to get past third-tier Exeter and top-flight strugglers Ipswich in the fourth and fifth rounds respectively this season.Nuno Espirito Santo 's side are enjoying a remarkable season that could culminate in Champions League qualification and a first FA Cup final appearance since 1991.""It was such a stressful moment. Matz saved us again. He's been doing really well. It's the third time and we've always been successful. Credit to him,"" Nuno said.""We are so happy. It's a huge moment for all of us to share with our fans.""We have to focus on the Premier League but it's going to be a beautiful moment for all of us on our journey.""Forest, who last won the FA Cup in 1959, have climbed to third in the Premier League, leaving them within touching distance of appearing in the Champions League for the first time since 1980-81.They are five points clear of fourth-placed Chelsea and six ahead of fifth-placed Manchester City with nine games to go.Brian Clough's men were the last Forest team to make the FA Cup semi-finals, beating West Ham before losing the final to Tottenham.Forest join Crystal Palace in the last four after the Eagles won 3-0 at Fulham in Saturday's other quarter-final.On Sunday, Manchester City travel to Bournemouth and Aston Villa visit Championship side Preston, the last club from outside the top tier in this season's tournament.Forest crushed Brighton 7-0 at the City Ground in Premier League in February, a result that ranked as the Seagulls' heaviest defeat for 67 years.Since that humbling loss, Brighton had won four times in a five-game unbeaten run in the league, but they were unable to stop Forest's penalty mastery.Nuno surprisingly dropped wingers Callum Hudson-Odoi and Anthony Elanga to the bench in a move that appeared to prioritise Tuesday's league clash with Manchester United.Forest were also without Chris Wood after their leading scorer suffered a hip injury on international duty with New Zealand.Wood's replacement Taiwo Awoniyi went close to an early opener, accelerating on to Ola Aina's pass for a stinging strike that Bart Verbruggen saved at his near post.But, shorn of their best attacking options, Forest struggled to make headway after that.Brighton were hardly much more incisive, with Pervis Estupinan's long-range blast pushed away by Sels.Carlos Baleba was inches away from putting the Seagulls ahead on the stroke of half-time, lashing just wide from the edge of the area.After their tepid start, Forest finally showed signs of life when Morgan Gibbs-White's strike from distance forced a superb save from Verbruggen.But Nuno had seen enough and sent on Hudson-Odoi and Elanga.Verbruggen repelled Elanga's close-range effort to force the tie into extra-time.Gomez nearly won it for Brighton in the closing stages, but his header from Brajan Gruda's cross was brilliantly saved by Sels, foreshadowing the keeper's heroics in the shoot-out.smg/dj",Nottingham Forest reach the FA Cup semi-finals for the first time in 34 years.

Real Madrid striker Kylian Mbappe equalled Cristiano Ronaldo 's first-season record of 33 goals for the club after scoring twice in Saturday's 3-2 victory over Leganes in La Liga , matching the Portuguese star's tally from the 2009-10 campaign across 44 appearances in all competitions.Mbappe's performance helped Real Madrid come from behind to secure the win at the Santiago Bernabeu , bringing them level with Barcelona at the top of the table before the Catalans' Sunday match against Girona.The French forward opened the scoring with a Panenka-style penalty down the middle and later completed Madrid's comeback with a free-kick after the team had fallen behind.""It's very special... to have the same number of goals as Cristiano is always good,"" Mbappe told Real Madrid TV. ""We know what he means for Real Madrid and me, we speak, he gives me a lot of advice, he scored many goals -- but we have to win trophies here.""Real Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti praised Mbappe's recent form following his summer transfer from Paris Saint-Germain.""He's doing very well, he's a lot more active and present in (the team's) play,"" Ancelotti told reporters.

CHENNAI: In an otherwise disappointing Indian Women’s League (IWL) campaign for Sethu FC, Amnah Nababi has been one of the few shining lights.But it is not just the on-field performances – she is Sethu’s best performer with six goals and one assist in 10 appearances – that have made her stand out in her maiden IWL season. The Uganda international, in her constant fight against poverty back home, is using football as a powerful tool to perform social work and give back to her community.The 26-year-old Amnah is allotting 20% of her IWL salary to “support” underprivileged children in her home district Luweero, situated about 70 kilometres from Kampala, where she is currently based. “Poverty is one thing that we are struggling with in Uganda. There are a lot of kids who do not have enough food at home, they do not have enough money to pay school fees. Their background is not really good. I pursued my education through scholarships, so I feel that I should go out there and support the kids from the money I receive through football,” said Amnah, who netted a brace in Sethu’s 3-1 victory over Odisha FC on Thursday.“Whenever I get an opportunity, I share the money with them. Obviously, I have been using my Sethu salary for the cause. One of the things I am planning to do after the IWL season is to go back home and give them more,” she added.Amnah, a capable operator in both attack and midfield, took the noble initiative a few years ago and now leads her “team” comprising about 30 children.“I started doing this during Covid. I had to do personal training (in Luweero) and the kids would come and play football with me. I used to play with them because I was free. After that, I became busy with football and work (she worked at an NGO). I have a small team, I cannot call it an academy because it is not registered. The kids stay around my home in Luweero and they get together after school in the evenings. I try to support them with small things.”Amnah relies on her friends when she is on duty away from home. “There are people who take care of the kids. Some of the kids who are now 15 or 16 years old take care of the younger ones. I have a lot of things to do when I go back home, many people are waiting for me. I hope to go there (Luweero) and spend time with the children,” Amnah said.Amnah, with a heart of gold and plenty of footballing tricks up her sleeve, is “setting an example” both on and off the field.","Amnah Nababi is Sethu FC's best performer in the Indian Women's League.

The management thanks him and wishes him success for the rest of his career,"" the CBF said in a statement.Dorival, aged 62, took over the managerial role in January 2024, replacing interim coach Fernando Diniz. However, his tenure has been marked by underwhelming performances in the 2026 World Cup qualifying matches for the tournament to be held across the United States, Mexico and Canada.Brazil's upcoming qualifying fixtures include an away match against Ecuador and a home game against Paraguay, scheduled for June 4 and June 9, respectively.""Nobody expected what we saw today (against Argentina), and the responsibility is entirely mine,"" the Brazil coach had said after the crushing defeat.Dorival assumed leadership of the Selecao following his successful tenure securing championships with Flamengo and Sao Paulo.Brazilian press reports suggest that Ancelotti remains a candidate to replace Dorival, alongside Portuguese tactician Jorge Jesus, who presently manages Al Hilal in Saudi Arabia.Another Portuguese coach, Abel Ferreira, who achieved multiple championships with Brazilian side Palmeiras, is also considered a potential candidate for the position.Ancelotti, however, is confident of completing the term of his contract in Madrid which runs until June 2026.The incoming manager's primary responsibility will be to revive Brazil's distinctive playing approach and secure their first championship since claiming the Copa America in 2019.","Dorival Junior has been dismissed from his position as Brazil's head coach.

Instead, he delivered a near-flawless performance, using his powerful serve and aggressive baseline game to become the first Czech player since Tomas Berdych in 2005 to win an ATP Masters 1000 event.Djokovic, appearing troubled by an issue under his right eye, frequently applied eye drops and consulted his team.Still, Mensik capitalised, racing to a 3-0 lead in the first set before Djokovic clawed back.

World number one Aryna Sabalenka secured her first Miami Open title by defeating American Jessica Pegula 7-5 6-2 in the WTA 1000 event final at Hard Rock Stadium on Saturday. This victory marks Sabalenka's second title of 2025, following her Brisbane triumph in January, and her eighth WTA 1000 title overall.Sabalenka, who had recently lost the Indian Wells final to Russian teenager Mirra Andreeva, showed determination not to repeat that outcome in Miami.""I'm super happy to have this trophy, I was able to play my best tennis in the final,"" said Sabalenka, acknowledging Pegula's performance and referencing their previous encounter at the US Open final.The first set was marked by service struggles, featuring seven breaks of serve.

She broke twice to establish a 3-1 lead and maintained her dominance to complete the victory in one hour and 27 minutes.""I think I was able to completely forget about (it being) the final, about the outside things and I was just so focused on the game,"" Sabalenka reflected.The Belarusian has won 12 of her last 14 matches against top 10 players, attributing her success to her performance in crucial moments.""It is all about those key moments of the match, about playing aggressive and staying with the game plan, going for shots without being afraid of losing the point,"" she explained.This marked Pegula's third loss to Sabalenka in a final.

Football superstar and Argentina's World Cup-winning captain Lionel Messi was in attendance at the Hard Rock Stadium on Friday, where Novak Djokovic advanced to the Miami Open final with a commanding victory over 14th-seeded Grigor DimitrovIn pursuit of his 100th singles title, and seventh in Miami, Djokovic won 6-2, 6-3 and will face upstart Jakub Mensik, who upset Taylor Fritz 7-6 (7-4), 4-6, 7-6 (7-4) in the other semfinial, for the title.During his post-match court interview, Djokovic recognised that Messi, who currently represents Inter Miami in Major League Soccer, was present, referring to him as ""King Leo.""Djokovic revealed that Messi, accompanied by his wife and children, visited the locker room where they exchanged presents. While Djokovic had previously attended Messi's matches, this marked the first occasion where the football star watched him play.""Obviously, it's a thrill to have his whole family,'' Djokovic said. ""It's a huge honour. He's such a great athlete, not just a football player. His impact on the world of sports in the last 20 years has been immense.""To have him watch me live brings me great joy and excitement and also a little pressure. It's definitely different when he brings his family. I was touched by that.""The 37-year-old Djokovic's performance hasn't been up to his lofty standards, beginning with a withdrawal due to injury at the Australian Open in January. At Indian Wells earlier this month, he suffered a first-round defeat against Botic van de Zandschulp.During the third game, play was halted when security personnel escorted a disruptive spectator from the venue. The chair umpire descended from his position and approached the stands while summoning security staff.Dimitrov engaged in a verbal exchange with the spectator and proceeded to direct the umpire's attention to the location of the troublesome fan at the sideline.""It's just heckling, it's fine,'' Dimitrov said. ""I'm a very calm guy overall. I don't pick any fights but don't trigger me.''Despite Dimitrov securing an early break against Djokovic in the opening game, the Serbian regained composure and secured the first set in 32 minutes.The current men's record holder of 24 Grand Slam titles displayed remarkable serving efficiency, landing 87% of first serves with merely six misses throughout the match. He maintained exceptional control, recording only five unforced errors during the 70-minute contest.""Now I know how it feels to be (John) Isner and (Reilly) Opelka,'' Djokovic said of two serving behemoths. ""Maybe my serve has been a bit underrated.""Djokovic extended his dominant head-to-head record against Dimitrov to 13-1. The Bulgarian player showcased his finest performance during the match.""He wears confidence like a stain on your shirt,'' Dimitrov said. ""It's beautiful to see. Only a few athletes on earth possess that quality.''Mensik, who entered the Miami Open as world number 54, has yet to reach a final in an ATP 1,000-point tournament.In a crucial moment against Fritz, he displayed remarkable composure at 4-4 in the final tiebreaker, securing victory by winning three consecutive points.Throughout the match lasting two hours and 25 minutes, Mensik failed to break serve but managed to win with a brilliant backhand winner down the line at 5-4. Fritz subsequently lost the next two points, sending a forehand long after a 20-shot exchange and netting a forehand on match point.Prior to the match, Mensik had a handshake with Messi. ""I didn't wash my hands before I stepped on the court,"" Mensik said.Tennis inspiration came to Mensik through Djokovic, whom he faced in a three-set match at the Shanghai Masters last October. The age difference between them stands at 18 years.","Novak Djokovic beats Grigor Dimitrov 6-2, 6-3 to reach Miami Open final.

Teenage tennis sensation Alexandra Eala maintained remarkable composure after delivering one of the WTA season's biggest upsets. The Filipina displayed minimal emotion after breaking world number two Iga Swiatek 's serve for the eighth time to advance to the Miami Open semi-finals.Despite her face momentarily quivering on the verge of tears following her victory, Eala remained composed. She celebrated modestly and proceeded with her post-match responsibilities with professional poise.""I think I was so in the moment, and I made it a point to be in the moment every point that it's hard to realise what just happened. It's hard to realise that you won the match,"" she explained, when asked about her immediate emotions to beating the five-time grand slam winner.""I really tried to soak it all in, because this has never happened to me before, and that's why I was looking at the screen. You know, I really wanted to keep that moment in my mind.""Eala exhibited remarkable poise in the biggest match of her WTA Tour career, showcasing excellent preparation despite her limited experience.""I don't have a lot of experience on the WTA Tour, that's for sure, but I do have experience with compartmentalising. I have experience with being professional.""""I have no hesitation to bring that part of me out when I'm on court and when I'm in a setting that calls for professionalism.""Eala's professional journey began at age 13 when she left the Philippines to join Rafael Nadal's academy in Mallorca. She has spent six years immersed in tennis, training alongside top coaches and aspiring tour players.Her disciplined approach stems more from family influence than her academy training.""It's not something I learned in the academy. It's something I've gotten from, I guess, from my experience as the things I have been through leading up to this moment. It's also something my family has guided me through, it's part of my family's values.""""They are successful people in business, they are successful in their own fields and people I look up to. I think they lead by example when it comes to that.""The match drew special supporters to her box. Her parents traveled from the Philippines, accompanied by an uncle and cousin from Seattle. Toni Nadal , Rafael's uncle and former coach, represented the academy.""So a lot of extra motivation for my match today. I really wanted to have my family see me winning, but I know they'd be happy just to see me compete in this setting.""""And Toni also came in to Miami. That did mean a lot, because I have been working closely with him for so long, alongside my main coaches from the academy, it showed a lot about the confidence and the pride the academy has in me.""Eala recalled a previous photograph with Swiatek at an academy graduation event two years ago. She expressed hope that her victory would inspire young people in the Philippines to pursue tennis.The 19-year-old from Quezon City joins a list of teenagers who have made dramatic entrances into WTA elite competition.

Miami Gardens: Alexandra Eala , a 19-year-old wildcard from the Philippines, produced a huge upset at the Miami Open on Wednesday, defeating world number two Iga Swiatek 6-2 7-5 to reach the semi-finals.Ranked 140th in the world, Eala, the first woman from her country to reach the last eight of a WTA 1000 tournament, took advantage of a unusually poor display from Swiatek, keeping her focus as she fought back from 4-2 down in the second set.Eala broke the Pole for the eighth and final time when Swiatek was serving to stay in the match at 6-5 down in the second set and looked stunned as she struggled to contain her emotions.""I'm just in disbelief right now.

The American came through 6-4, 6-7, 6-2.""Just because I won this match or the one before doesn't make the next one any less tough. If anything it will be more tough, so it will take everything that I have,"" said Eala.Swiatek will look forward to moving on to the clay season after conceding that she had been far from her usual level.""I'm sure I wasn't playing my best game and I felt like my forehand collapsed a little, so it wasn't comfortable and Alexandra, for sure, used her chances and pushed me, so for sure she deserves to win this match,"" she said.""I don't want to think about this too long. It's nice to learn from losses but there are other things ahead and I am happy we are going to play on clay.""",Wildcard Alexandra Eala beats world number two Iga Swiatek 6-2 7-5 in Miami.

Thiruvananthapuram:

Gautam Gambhir's year as India coach ends like it started - on a chaotic note

Under the lights at Thiruvananthapuram’s Greenfield Stadium, cheered on by nearly 6,000 fans, India delivered another emphatic all-round performance to surge 3–0 up in the five-match T20 series against Sri Lanka on Friday. Winning the toss for the third consecutive game, Harmanpreet Kaur once again chose to field, and India exploited the conditions perfectly, strangling Sri Lanka to 112/7 before Shafali Verma's dazzling riposte.The Indian opener's staggering assault left Sri Lanka scrambling for cover. Her unbeaten 79 off 42 was the cornerstone of a dominant chase, powering India home with more than six overs to spare and eight wickets in the shed, underlining the gulf between the teams.Medium-pacer Renuka Singh, who was adjudged the Player of the Match, set the tone for India early. Sharp, skiddy and relentlessly accurate, she was the enforcer-in-chief, ripping through Sri Lanka’s middle order with figures of 4/21.Sri Lanka opener Hasini Perera briefly lit up the evening with a breezy 25, but her resistance was snuffed out swiftly. Harshitha Samarawickrama chipped straight back, Nilakshika Silva was pinned in front of the crease.Imesha Dulani was the Himachali girl's fourth scalp.If Renuka brought the fire, Deepti Sharma brought the ice. Returning after missing a game due to fever, the allrounder slipped straight back into command mode, picking up three vital wickets and becoming the joint-highest wicket-taker in women's T20Is. She has now equalled Megan Schutt with 151 international wickets in this format.Sri Lanka opener Chamari Athapaththu’s scratchy stay ended in Deepti’s web, and later she removed Kavisha Dilhari — after a punchy 20 hinted at a shift in momentum — and Malsha Shehani to ensure Sri Lanka never escaped the squeeze.In pursuit, India barely allowed the contest to breathe. The girl from Rohtak continued her purple patch with a second consecutive fifty in the series, reaching the landmark tonight in just 24 deliveries. Shafali bats like she’s borrowed Virender Sehwag’s playbook: fearless, uncluttered and unapologetically aggressive.She was particularly brutal against left-arm spinner Nimasha Meepage, hammering 29 runs from her two Powerplay overs, and unfurled one irresistible cover drive off pacer Malki Madara that brought the crowd to its feet. Like Sehwag, Shafali thrives on instinct rather than convention, trusting her eye, timing and power over textbook technique. In that sense, she doesn’t just echo his style, but embodies his philosophy, reimagined for the new generation.Her dominance allowed the rest of the batting group time and freedom to settle, as India cruised home in complete control. Ruthless with the ball, fearless with the bat, India once again dictated every phase, in a performance as commanding as it was entertaining.""It was a great series for all of us. That's what we discussed after the (ODI) World Cup that we have to raise our standard and be more aggressive in T20s because the (T20) World Cup is coming up so we are happy with our overall performances,"" Harmanpreet beamed at the post-match presentation.",India thrash Sri Lanka by eight wickets to take 3-0 lead in T20 series. Shafali Verma scores unbeaten 79 to power India home in Thiruvananthapuram. Deepti Sharma takes three wickets and becomes joint-highest wicket-taker in women's T20Is.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126192913,imgsize-291954,width-400,resizemode-4/ind-w-vs-sl-w-3rd-t20i-match.jpg"

Poll What do you think is the main reason for England's struggles in the Ashes series against Australia? Inadequate preparation and mindset Poor performances from key players Overconfidence in Bazball philosophy Australia's superior cricketing skills

The Bazballers arrived on Australian shores with plenty of noise, wrapped in bravado and belief, armed with soundbites about fearlessness and a self-appointed mission to save Test cricket -- a cause they have gone gaga over for the past few years. But the aura has thinned. The defiance feels rehearsed. Australia have done what they have done to almost every visiting side -- barring India in 2017–18 and 2020–21 -- strip away the noise, test the method, and grind it down to its barest truths.This was not a clash of philosophies; it was a reality check.England swung hard, spoke louder, and clung to conviction even as conditions, quality, and context caught up with them. England's Bazball didn’t just lose the Ashes in 11 days; it lost its credibility. The idea still survives, loudly defended by its believers, but the illusion of invincibility is gone. And once that disappears, cults are forced to confront the hardest question of all: what remains when faith turns to failure?Eight weeks into this Ashes, the Bazball philosophy lies bruised on the mat, sobered and unmistakably exposed. Australia is not an easy place to win. The scoreline is unforgiving at 3–0, and after Day 1 at the MCG, there appears to be no end to England’s suffering. Twenty wickets fell on a frenetic opening day, but it was the home side who emerged on top with a sizeable first-innings lead of 46 runs.England have been under intense scrutiny since landing Down Under, with several former greats -- including former captains Michael Vaughan , Ian Botham and Geoffrey Boycott -- publicly questioning Brendon McCullum’s side and its preparation for the series.There had been genuine optimism ahead of the tour that England might finally end their 14-year wait for an Ashes triumph in Australia. Instead, history repeated itself. England once again fell short, extending their winless run on Australian soil to 18 Tests. That number may well reach 19 by the end of the week.Individually, two of England's modern day greats - Joe Root and skipper Ben Stokes - have never won a Test in Australia. Overall, Root has lost 21 Ashes Tests and Stokes 17.England have also drawn attention during the tour for their off-field activities. The team was first spotted playing golf in Perth both before and immediately after their two-day defeat in the opening Test.Following their eight-wicket loss at The Gabba, the 'Bazballers' then took a pre-arranged mid-series break in Noosa. Players were seen relaxing with drinks and a casual kickabout on the beach. In the aftermath of the third Test, the BBC reported that England’s players had been out drinking for six days following the second Test.During England’s 4–1 mauling at the hands of Rohit Sharma’s young Indian side a couple of years ago, former England captain Nasser Hussain had remarked: “At times, Bazball in this regime has been described as a cult where you cannot criticise, either within or externally.”That mindset has been one of the cornerstones of Stokes and Brendon McCullum’s leadership since they took charge in the summer of 2022. No finger-pointing, only good vibes. Crusty old quotes from former players, media and critics are ignored, irrespective of results. Winning, as has been said repeatedly, isn’t even the most important thing.Bazball may sound like a novel idea in modern cricket, but it finds precedent in the world of club football -- particularly among the Ultras. The term refers to supporters whose loyalty crosses into fanaticism, defined by uncompromising devotion to their teams.Their history has often been marred by violence and gang rivalries, giving the movement a bloodstained reputation. Yet the intensity of their support is such that Ultras, usually stationed behind the goals, wield real influence, commanding the attention of players and club hierarchies alike. Trophies matter, but what truly defines an Ultra is the disciplined, almost militaristic backing of the club through success and failure.Take the example of Berlin’s top clubs. Hertha Berlin and Union Berlin, shaped on opposite sides of the Wall, carry a more understated identity than Germany’s global powerhouses Bayern Munich and Borussia Dortmund. There were even periods when Berlin lacked a top-flight club altogether. Still, beneath the surface, the city’s football culture has remained vibrant and deeply entrenched.“If you want to define culture as being about success, titles, numbers and industry, f**k off. Then you have to go to Bayern Munich or Borussia Dortmund,” rapper Liquit Walker, a lifelong Union Berlin fan, once told Copa90. “But if you want to see real culture, real football culture, this is the place to be.”Much like football Ultras, the Bazball movement has found loyal supporters -- particularly among sections of the media and former cricketers, who have sold the idea as though cricket has been reinvented.But cricket can never be football. No matter how it is packaged, the Bazball idea is falling flat, and its accompanying arrogance has only made matters worse.Take Alastair Cook, England’s hero during the 2010–11 Ashes -- the last time they won in Australia. Cook scored 766 runs. In India in 2012, another rare overseas triumph, he made 562 runs. Substance, not slogans, defined those victories.But Stokes has famoulsy said that even England’s greatest past players might not have survived in the current regime. They went all in on the cult of Bazball and initially found the backing of fans to flourish. But in recent weeks, Australia -- a side Stuart Broad had labelled the “weakest since 2010” — have outplayed England in every facet, despite not fielding their best XI in every Test.This England side, like many cults before it, is beginning to fracture. The Bazballers, once tipped to be invincible, appear closer to their reckoning.Former England captain Mike Atherton captured it succinctly in his column for The Times: “The biggest fascination for me about ‘Bazball’ was always whether ‘no-consequence’, carefree cricket could hold up under the fiercest pressure… The answer, clearly, has been no. The harsh realities of professional sport have resurfaced and swamped them.”So far, this Ashes for the Bazballers has been defined by golf, beaches, booze -- and batterings.",England have been under intense scrutiny since landing Down Under. Former greats have publicly questioned Brendon McCullum’s side and its preparation for the series. England have also drawn attention during the tour for their off-field activities.

Why Rohit Sharma got really emotional at a promotional event

JAIPUR: Call it the sport’s multiplier effect. Following Rohit Sharma ’s entertaining batting display against Sikkim on Wednesday, the Rajasthan Cricket Association (RCA) officials are bracing themselves for another surge, this time greater, of fans when the star studded Mumbai play their second Vijay Hazare Trophy match at the Sawai Mansingh Stadium here on Friday.It will be Blockbuster Friday should Rohit continue his magical batting show against Uttarakhand.On Wednesday, around 20,000 spectators showed up and enjoyed the match as Rohit unleashed his wide range of strokes to hammer a 94-ball 155 runs as Mumbai cruised to an eight-wicket win over the minnows.With Christmas holidays on, the organisers are expecting more spectators Friday.“We are opening two more stands in the north block as we are expecting more cricket lovers on Friday. There were at least two-three thousand fans waiting outside on Wednesday as the stands we opened were absolutely packed. We will make all possible efforts so that more people can watch the Mumbai match tomorrow. It will be free entry for all the spectators,” RCA ad-hoc committee convener DD Kumawat told TOI on Thursday.Uttarakhand, who lost to Himachal Pradesh in their opening match on Wednesday, also had a practice session on Thursday.The Mumbai team, meanwhile, had an optional practice session on Thursday and only eight players turned up at the RCA Academy ground in the afternoon session.Most of the senior players including Rohit and captain Shardul Thakur opted to rest.The Khan brothers — Sarfaraz and Musheer — had a long batting session in the nets. Upcoming batter Suryansh Shedge and experienced left-arm spinner Shams Mulani sweated it out in the nets. Those players who did not get a chance to play against Sikkim showed up at the optional practice along with the support staff. After nets, all of them went through fielding drills and catching sessions.Some of the die-hard fans also turned up at the RCA Academy ground hoping to get a glimpse of Rohit but they were disappointed as the star did not come to the venue. “We are obviously disappointed not to see him today at the practice but we will be surely coming to see the match tomorrow and hoping to get full entertainment from Rohit’s batting display,” said some of the fans on Thursday.","Mumbai play second Vijay Hazare Trophy match at Sawai Mansingh Stadium on Friday.

Gautam Gambhir's year as India coach ends like it started - on a chaotic note

Former England captain Michael Vaughan has strongly criticised the pitch used for the Boxing Day Test at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, saying it was too difficult for batters. The match saw an unusual amount of action on Day 1, with as many as 20 wickets falling, something that has not happened in an Ashes Test for 75 years.Vaughan felt the pitch offered far too much help to the bowlers and did not provide a fair contest between bat and ball. Australia ended the first day at 4 without loss and held a lead of 46 runs, but the focus remained on the nature of the surface.“We’re always looking for a fair balance between bat and ball. I thought that was unfair for the batters. The pitch has done plenty. There’s been plenty of movement out there. It’s not been easy for both sides, but I don’t like seeing a pitch do so much,” Vaughan told the BBC.The fall of 20 wickets in a single day underlined just how challenging the conditions were. Australia were bowled out for 152 in their first innings, with England pacer Josh Tongue picking up an impressive 5 for 45. In reply, England struggled even more and were dismissed for just 110 runs. Australian bowlers Michael Neser and Scott Boland made full use of the conditions, taking four and three wickets respectively.Despite Australia holding a clear advantage, Vaughan cautioned against writing England off.He pointed out that England have shown in recent times that they are capable of chasing big totals in the fourth innings.“They are a good chasing side. We have had three heavy rollers already, and there will be another one tomorrow morning. This England team can chase. Australia are favourites, but don’t rule England out,” Vaughan said.With the pitch expected to change as the match progresses, the Test remains finely poised despite the dramatic first day.","Former England captain Michael Vaughan has criticised the pitch used for the Boxing Day Test at the Melbourne Cricket Ground.

Virat Kohli's childhood coach makes a big statement on 2027 ODI World Cup

Indian batting stalwart Virat Kohli once again showed why he is regarded as one of the greatest batters of all time. On Friday, the former India captain played a brilliant knock of 77 runs for Delhi against Gujarat in the Vijay Hazare Trophy match in Bengaluru.While the innings helped his team, it also earned Kohli a special place in cricket history.With this knock, Kohli went past former Australian cricketer Michael Bevan to become the highest-averaging batter in the history of the List A cricket, among players with at least 5,000 runs.Kohli’s List A average now stands at 57.87, just ahead of Bevan’s record of 57.86.Bevan was widely known as one of the best finishers in one-day cricket, and his record had stood strong for many years.Kohli’s innings against Gujarat came off just 61 balls. Over the years, Kohli has often been compared to Sachin Tendulkar for his hunger for runs and centuries.In recent months, questions had been raised about Kohli’s form and his place in the one-day setup.Instead of slowing down, the 37-year-old has responded with an incredible run of scores.In his last six List A matches, Kohli has scored 584 runs at a staggering average of 146.00.His scores during this period include 77 against Gujarat, 131 against Andhra, an unbeaten 65 against South Africa, 102 and 135 in other games against South Africa, and 74 against Australia.Kohli’s form throughout 2025 has been just as impressive.His strike rate in List A cricket this year has stayed above 110, proving that he has adapted well to the faster pace of modern white-ball cricket.Recently, Kohli also became the fastest player in history to reach 16,000 List A runs. He achieved this milestone 61 innings quicker than Sachin Tendulkar.","Virat Kohli scored 77 runs for Delhi against Gujarat in the Vijay Hazare Trophy match in Bengaluru.

Gautam Gambhir's year as India coach ends like it started - on a chaotic note

Former England captain Alastair Cook delivered a forthright critique of the Melbourne Cricket Ground surface after a chaotic opening day of the Boxing Day Test that saw all 20 wickets tumble, leaving batters from both sides searching for answers.From the outset, conditions proved hostile. The ball moved appreciably through the air and deviated sharply off the pitch, making strokeplay a high-risk exercise. Even players who appeared set at the crease struggled to trust the bounce, with constant seam movement forcing errors. The difficulty of batting was starkly underlined by the scorecard, which showed not a single half-century across the entire day.Traditionally viewed as a venue that offers balance between bat and ball, the MCG did not live up to that reputation on Friday. Australia, sent in to bat, were dismissed for just 152 before responding emphatically with the ball to bowl England out for 110. Wickets fell at a relentless pace, offering little respite and ensuring the contest remained on a knife-edge after an extraordinary first day.Speaking on TNT Sports, Cook did not hold back in his assessment of the surface, arguing that it tilted the contest too heavily in favour of the bowlers.“This is not a great Test wicket. Unless this flattens out on days two, three and four, if we get there, then that was too heavily weighted in the bowlers’ favour. The bowlers didn’t have to work that hard for wickets,” Cook said.By stumps, Australia had reached 4 without loss, extending their overall lead to 46 runs. Scott Boland was unbeaten on four, with Travis Head yet to take guard, setting up a delicately balanced situation heading into the next day.Cook acknowledged that both batting line-ups could have shown greater application, but felt the conditions made scoring runs exceptionally difficult from the very start.“Could both sides have batted slightly better? Yes, but if you put the ball in the right area, it was going to nip either way. It was a bit of an unfair contest,” he explained.He also highlighted the challenge posed by Australia’s bowlers, singling out Boland for his relentless accuracy and movement.“I was watching Boland, in particular, and I was thinking, ‘I don’t know how you face that’. To left-handers he was coming around the wicket, attacking the stumps, with some balls jagging one way and some the other. I also don’t know where you go as a right-hander. The pitch should flatten out tomorrow, but the groundsman was telling me he doesn’t think it will,” Cook added.","Alastair Cook criticises Melbourne Cricket Ground surface.

Gautam Gambhir's year as India coach ends like it started - on a chaotic note

Star batters Virat Kohli and Rishabh Pant struck composed half-centuries before Gujarat unravelled under pressure, allowing Delhi to sneak home by seven runs in their Elite Group D Vijay Hazare Trophy clash on Friday. Kohli was named player of the match after a fluent 77 off 61 balls, while Pant contributed a measured 70 from 79 deliveries as Delhi posted 254 for nine in their 50 overs. Gujarat, despite being well placed for long periods of the chase, were bowled out for 247 in 47.4 overs.Kohli once again had to walk in early following the dismissal of opener Priyansh Arya and immediately looked at ease. After defending his first delivery, he drove pacer Chintan Gaja straight down the ground for four, setting the tone for a stylish innings. While Delhi’s other batters struggled to break free against disciplined bowling, Kohli found rhythm with ease in his favoured white-ball format.A pulled six off Gaja and a wristy flicked boundary off Arzan Nagwaswalla followed as Kohli stepped up the tempo. The 37-year-old brought up his fifty in just 29 balls, an innings that featured 10 fours and a six. He later registered his 85th List A half-century by carving Ravi Bishnoi over the covers.Kohli looked set for back-to-back hundreds before left-arm spinner Vishal Jayswal brought his innings to an end. Reading Kohli’s movement early, Jayswal fired one through to have him stumped by Urvil Patel, leaving Delhi at 108 for four. The spinner had earlier removed Nitish Rana and Arpit Gupta, tightening the screws further.With wickets falling, Pant took it upon himself to stabilise the innings. Resisting his natural attacking instincts, the Delhi captain focused on strike rotation and partnerships. He crossed fifty in 64 balls, with his first moment of invention coming via a falling scoop off Bishnoi, which he attempted again later against Gaja. Pant’s stay ended when he lost his stumps to Jayswal, bringing an end to a vital 73-run stand with Harsh Tyagi, who made 40.Late runs from Simarjeet Singh and Ishant Sharma helped Delhi cross the 250 mark, giving their bowlers something to defend.Gujarat’s chase began promisingly on a slightly tacky surface at the BCCI Centre of Excellence. Urvil Patel and Aarya Desai put on 67 for the opening stand, before Aarya and Abhishek Desai added another 54 to take Gujarat to 121 for one after 25 overs.From there, the chase derailed rapidly. Aarya, Abhishek, Jaymeet Patel and Hemang Patel fell in quick succession as Gujarat slipped to 144 for five, adding only 23 runs in the process. Saurav Chauhan, who once represented Royal Challengers Bengaluru in the IPL, revived hopes with a counter-attacking 49 off 43 balls, adding 69 runs with Vishal Jayswal for the sixth wicket.Chauhan struck Arpit for two sixes to keep the asking rate manageable, but Simarjeet Singh returned to dismiss him, triggering another collapse at a crucial stage. A late run-out of Gaja left Gujarat needing 12 runs from 17 balls with one wicket in hand.The final blow came when Prince Yadav produced a sharp delivery to dismiss Bishnoi, finishing with figures of three for 37. Kohli sprinted in from cover to take the catch, celebrating emphatically as Delhi sealed a hard-fought victory.Brief scoresDelhi: 254/9 in 50 overs (Virat Kohli 77, Rishabh Pant 70, Harsh Tyagi 40; Vishal Jayswal 4/42)Gujarat: 247 all out in 47.4 overs (Aarya Desai 57, Saurav Chauhan 49; Prince Yadav 3/37, Ishant Sharma 2/28)","Kohli named player of the match after a fluent 77 off 61 balls.

The All India Football Federation (AIFF) on Friday proposed a new structure for the Indian Super League (ISL), under which the league would be owned and operated by the national body in accordance with its new constitution for the next 20 seasons.According to the new proposal the AIFF formulated after a meeting with the ISL clubs, the league will implement a promotion and relegation system from the upcoming season. Each season will be calculated from June 1 to May 31 of the next year.""We have sent the proposal to the clubs, we have to wait for their response in the next couple of days before finalising our plan,"" an AIFF source told PTI.""Let the clubs respond, we will try to find a solution after hearing them.""It is expected that the AIFF and the clubs will have two more rounds of meetings -- one on Sunday and the other on Monday.If all goes well, the ISL season may start in the first week of February, according to the source.According to the proposal, the ISL will have a predetermined 'Central Operational Budget' for every year that would come from yearly contributions from all 'revenue share holders' proportionate to their revenue share in the league.""This would be known as the 'League Membership Contribution'. Any operational expenses required for the league to be conducted and for clubs to comply with their applicable licensing criteria with the addition of prize money distribution would be capped and borne out of this budget,"" the proposal said.""Governance would be overseen by a Board that would be empowered by the AIFF general body with certain operational autonomy over commercial matters of the League. The jurisdiction of the board would be limited to the utilisation of unrestricted funds within the yearly operational budget earmarked for the same.""Each club, under the proposal, will pay the AIFF a 'standard participating fee' of Rs 1 crore a year at the beginning of the season. This would, however, be independent of any calculations of the 'Central Operating Expenditure'.""This amount would be fully reimbursable from the central revenue prior to distribution of 'Net Revenue'. The total participation fee for all clubs would be put at 20% of the 'central operational budget' of the League. In case the Board decides to raise the 'central operational budget' by 10% in the future, the 'standard participation fee' would proportionately increase.""Any profit, or savings from the operational budget, will be distributed equally amongst all revenue shareholders in proportion to the respective revenue shares.On December 20, a proposal from 10 ISL clubs for ""perpetual"" operational and commercial ownership of the country's top-tier competition failed to get the approval of the AIFF's General Body, which formed a committee to look into the matter.The AIFF panel was tasked with holding discussions with representatives of five clubs - Chennaiyin FC, Mumbai City FC, Delhi Sporting Club, NorthEast United FC and Mohun Bagan Super Giant from December 22 to 29.Under the AIFF's proposal, the total outlay of the first season of the ISL will be Rs 70 crore with the AIFF's revenue share pegged at 10 per cent (that is Rs 7 crore) in the first season, while 50 per cent (Rs 35 crore) will come from the clubs -- 14 as of now unless there is any pull out.But interestingly, a revenue share of 30 per cent has been reserved for a potential commercial partner. The AIFF is yet to get a commercial partner as it did not receive any bid after a tender was floated on the supervision of a Supreme Court-appointed committee under a retired SC judge.Though the AIFF has included a 30 per cent revenue share for a potential commercial partner in the proposal, it is learnt that since the number of matches this season could be less than earlier years, the ISL can be run with a 'central operating budget' of less than the proposed Rs 70 crore.",The All India Football Federation (AIFF) has proposed a new structure for the Indian Super League (ISL) The league would be owned and operated by the national body in accordance with its new constitution for the next 20 seasons. The league will implement a promotion and relegation system from the upcoming season.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126192353,imgsize-47578,width-400,resizemode-4/aiff.jpg"

RABAT: Organisers at the Africa Cup of Nations in Morocco are allowing supporters in for free after kick-off in matches where stadiums are not full, a Confederation of African Football source told AFP.The Group F game between Cameroon and Gabon on Wednesday in Agadir kicked off in front of almost empty stands but the ground filled up significantly over the course of the first half despite incessant rain.The official attendance was later announced as 35,200 inside a venue which can hold over 45,000.There have been similar scenes at numerous matches across the opening days of the competition, even leading to confusion over the attendance figures themselves.The crowd at Tuesday's Group D encounter between the Democratic Republic of Congo and Benin at Rabat's Al Medina Stadium -- which filled up considerably over the course of the game -- was initially announced as 6,703 before later being corrected to 13,073.The CAF source indicated that organisers, in agreement with African football's governing body, were opening stands around 20 minutes into games to allow fans gathered outside to enter without paying.Filling stadiums is an important issue for Cup of Nations organisers in Morocco, for which a successful hosting of the tournament is key as it builds towards the 2030 World Cup to be jointly held in the North African country, Spain and Portugal.CAF's official ticketing platform on Thursday showed seats available for almost all remaining group matches for prices starting at 100 dirhams ($10.96).The only matches shown as sell-outs were hosts Morocco's games against Mali on Friday and Zambia on Monday, as well as Algeria against Burkina Faso on Sunday and Algeria versus Equatorial Guinea next Wednesday.","Africa Cup of Nations organisers are allowing supporters in for free after kick- off in matches where stadiums are not full.

Where did it all go wrong for Indian football?

FC Goa players made a strong statement during their AFC Champions League 2 match against FC Istiklol by staging a silent protest before kick-off on Wednesday at the Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium.As the referee blew the whistle for kick-off, the FC Goa players staged the pre-planned protest and did not play for a few seconds.The protest was aimed at highlighting the “deepening uncertainty” that is affecting the Indian football ecosystem.Issues related to administration and commercial matters have caused major delays around top-tier domestic football competitions like the Indian Super League and the I-League.Players, coaches, and staff across clubs are feeling the impact of this situation.Soon after the incident, FC Goa released a statement on social media to explain their action.“This action was solely intended to draw attention to the broader challenges facing the domestic football ecosystem,” the club said in an official statement.FC Goa also made it clear that the protest was not against their opponents or the Asian Football Confederation.Instead, it was meant to show the frustration and concern felt by those involved in Indian football, who are unsure about the future of the game in the country.On the field, FC Goa started well despite the tense backdrop. The home team took the lead in the eighth minute when Dejan Drazic found space inside the box and scored with a fine curling shot into the top corner.In the second half, Istiklol made a strong comeback. A defensive mistake allowed Paul Komolafe to score the equaliser in the 53rd minute.Just three minutes later, another error led to a penalty, which Amirbek Juraboev converted to put the visitors ahead.FC Goa tried hard to score an equaliser, but their efforts did not succeed.Istiklol held on to win 2-1.

Lionel Messi India trip: Mumbai out in numbers for the superstar





No takers for game





Court hearings, President's appeal, sports ministry intervention





Women and juniors shine

NEW DELHI: Indian football remained in a state of terminal decline after experiencing arguably its darkest phase in a year marked by severe administrative crisis, court hearings, financial issues, absence of domestic leagues, and a steep decline in performance of the senior men's team.As the year drew to a close, the high-profile Lionel Messi GOAT India Tour generated some interest and forced a conversation around the sport.The much-publicised event did what it was meant to, and was not supposed to serve as a catalyst for real improvement in Indian football.If its own problems were not enough, the chaos and absolute disorder at Salt Lake Stadium on the first day of the Messi tour added to the embarrassment.While the breakdown of law and order in the 'Mecca of Indian football' was not good advertisement, the remaining three legs in Hyderabad, Mumbai and Delhi were well organised.Of the many disappointments, one on-field moment that still stings came when little-known Bangladeshi midfielder Sheikh Morsalin darted into the box and slipped the ball between the legs of Gurpreet Singh Sandhu with a delicate touch, completing another round of humiliation.The 11th minute strike, in an inconsequential 2027 AFC Asian Cup qualifying match on a November evening in Dhaka, meant the Indian senior men's team suffered its first defeat to Bangladesh in 22 years, after having struggled through the last 12 months to produce a result of any significance.While several factors contribute to a country's overall football ecosystem, globally the senior team's performance is often the most visible metric, and India was found severely wanting on that front.Unlike in 2024, when the team drew a blank in international matches, the Indian senior men's side did manage to churn out a few wins occasionally this year, including a bronze medal finish at the CAFA Nations Cup in the central Asian countries of Tajikistan and Uzbekistan in September.But, in the matches that mattered the most, India failed to deliver and could not qualify for the Asian Cup for the first time since the 2011 edition, following which the team plummeted further in the FIFA rankings.Besides Bangladesh, the team also suffered defeats to other lower-ranked opponents such as Hong Kong and Singapore, a 1-2 loss to whom dashed its hopes of entering the Asian Cup following a disappointing campaign in the Qualifications.While the men's team struggled on the field, especially when it came to scoring goals, the administrators grappled with issues off it.The game remained in the middle of a crisis due to the All India Football Federation's failure to secure a new commercial partner for the Indian Super League after its previous contract with the Reliance-owned Football Sports Development Limited (FSDL) expired on December 8.On expected lines, the lack of a commercial partner has had a crippling effect on the game. The ISL, which would have been into its third month now under normal circumstances, remains on hold.The sponsors are pulling out, clubs have put their operations on hold, players are staring at an uncertain future, after having implored each and every stakeholder to resolve the issue, and serious doubts hover over the domestic leagues' future.The ongoing crisis has highlighted a systemic failure in the country's football ecosystem brought about by poor governance, lack of long-term vision and the absence of proper youth development programmes.The year was also marked by frequent hearings at the Supreme Court and intervention from the union sports ministry to resolve the crisis. Even President Droupadi Murmu asked the stakeholders of Indian football to work together for the upliftment of the game in the country, reflecting the severity of the situation.When the Supreme Court approved the draft Constitution of the AIFF, prepared by former apex court judge L Nageswara Rao, in September, it was believed that a solution amenable to all concerned parties would finally be arrived at.However, no such thing happened in the ensuing months.Amid the gloom surrounding the sport, the women's national teams and the junior squads have impressed with their performances, raising hopes of a better future. In Chiang Mai, Thailand in July, the women's team scripted history by qualifying directly for the AFC Women's Asian Cup 2026, a feat never achieved before.Up against regional heavyweights and hosts Thailand in the final, the Indian women rode on Sangita Basfore's brilliant brace to emerge winners and make a statement of sorts. The achievement reminded one of former AIFF president Praful Patel's old statement that chances of the Indian women's team playing in a FIFA World Cup before their male counterparts are higher.While the girls still have a long way to go, they are definitely moving in the right direction.In another milestone, Indian Women's League reigning champions East Bengal FC became the first team from the country to win a main-draw match in the AFC Women's Champions League, helping the side earn a direct spot in the league stages of the next edition.As far as the junior teams were concerned, the India squad lifted its seventh SAFF U-17 Championship title in Sri Lanka, edging out Bangladesh in a dramatic final that went to penalties after a 2-2 stalemate.Under the guidance of Bibiano Fernandes, India then shocked continental giants Iran 2-1 to qualify for their 10th U-17 Asian Cup finals, even as the struggle to monetise the sport continued without a solution in sight.",Indian football remained in a state of terminal decline after experiencing arguably its darkest phase in a year marked by severe administrative crisis.

The return of war

A story that lives on

On Christmas morning in 1914, something happened that no military plan could have predicted and no weapon could have forced. In the middle of World War I , one of the bloodiest conflicts in human history, soldiers laid down their guns and stepped out of their trenches. And what did they do? They ended up playing football.For a few precious hours, war made way for humanity. This moment, now known as the Christmas Truce, remains one of the most powerful stories ever told about football and peace.Fought between the Allied Powers, backed by France, Britain, Russia, later joined by the US, Italy, and Japan, and the Central Powers, led by Germany, Austria-Hungary, the Ottoman Empire, and Bulgaria, World War I had erupted in the summer of 1914.Europe was torn apart as nations rushed into battle with confidence and somewhat misplaced optimism.Many soldiers believed the war would be short.“Home by Christmas,” they said.Instead, by December, the war had stalled into a brutal deadlock. Soldiers on both sides were trapped in muddy trenches across Belgium and northern France.Life there was unbearable. Freezing cold, constant shelling, disease, hunger, and fear became daily companions.Young men, many of whom were barely out of school, faced death every hour.Christmas was approaching, but joy felt impossible.On the night of December 24, something strange happened along parts of the Western Front. British soldiers heard singing coming from the German trenches.At first, they suspected a trick. But the tune was unmistakable. The Germans were singing Christmas carols.“Stille Nacht”, which translates to Silent Night in English, floated gently through the cold air. British troops replied with their own songs.Soon, laughter replaced gunfire. Shouts of “Merry Christmas!” crossed no man’s land, the deadly strip of ground that usually meant instant death.Against all logic, the blazing sounds of gunfire went silent.As dawn broke on Christmas Day, soldiers cautiously climbed out of their trenches. Hands raised. No weapons. No orders. No one fired.British and German soldiers met in the middle. They shook hands. They smiled awkwardly. They exchanged cigarettes, chocolate, buttons, badges, and even small gifts sent from home.Photographs of loved ones were shown. Stories were shared. For the first time, soldiers saw the faces of the men they had been told to hate. They discovered something shocking. The enemy looked just like them.Then came the football. In some places, it was a proper leather football. In others, it was a bundle of rags tied together. It didn’t matter. There were no goalposts, no referee, no rules. Hwever, soldiers marked goals with caps or coats. Their boots were heavy, and the ground was frozen and uneven. But they couldn't care less.British soldiers kicked the ball with German soldiers. Scores were kept loosely, if at all.Some accounts claim the Germans won one match 3–2. Others say the result didn’t matter, because the real victory was simply playing.Soldiers used the calm to recover bodies that had been lying in no man’s land for weeks. Joint burial services were held. Prayers were said together.Men who would soon be ordered to kill each other stood side by side in silence.Many later wrote letters home describing how surreal it felt.One British soldier wrote that it seemed “too wonderful to be real.” Another admitted he struggled afterwards to fire at men he had just shared laughter with.The Christmas Truce was never officially approved. High-ranking officers were furious when they learned what had happened. To them, the truce threatened discipline and the will to fight.Orders were quickly sent down the line. By December 26, the guns roared again. The war resumed its brutal course. Many of the men who played football that day would be killed in the months that followed.For years, the Christmas Truce was pushed aside. Military leaders feared it showed too much humanity in war. Some reports were censored. Others were ignored. But stories have a way of surviving.Letters were found in attics. Diaries were published. Veterans spoke quietly of that day when the war stopped making sense. Slowly, the truth emerged.Football already belonged to everyone in 1914. It was played in England, Germany, France, and beyond. It needed no shared language. No explanation. You just kicked the ball.That simplicity made football powerful. It reminded soldiers of home. Of weekends. Of joy. Of life before the trenches.Football did not end the war. But it proved that hatred was learned, and humanity was natural.Today, more than a century later, the Christmas Truce is remembered across the football world. Memorial matches are held. Statues stand near former battlefields. Clubs and fans share the story every December.Because on Christmas Day in 1914, football did something extraordinary. It reminded the world that before we are soldiers, enemies, or nations, we are human beings. And sometimes, a simple game is enough to make us remember that.","In the middle of World War I, soldiers laid down their guns and stepped out of their trenches. For a few precious hours, war made way for humanity. This moment, now known as the Christmas Truce, remains one of the most powerful stories ever told about football and peace.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126163701,imgsize-106194,width-400,resizemode-4/soldiers-playing-football-in-no-man39s-land-a-year-after-the-christmas-truce-in-1914-photo-credit-universal-history-archiveuiggetty-images.jpg"

KALYANI: Captain Dangmei Grace struck a brace as Sreebhumi FC registered a resounding 4-0 win over Gokulam Kerala FC in an Indian Women's League match here on Wednesday.Grace was the standout performer, scoring in the fourth and 59th minutes, while midfielder Rimpa Haldar added the third goal in the 66th minute before Anju Chanu rounded off the scoreline in the 77th minute.The contest was effectively set in motion within the opening minutes, with Sreebhumi wasting no time in asserting themselves. Barely four minutes had elapsed when Grace opened the scoring, capitalising on a swift move down the right flank. Sibani Devi swung in an inviting cross, and the Sreebhumi captain rose above defender Kritina Devi to power a header into the net.Stung by the early setback, Gokulam Kerala attempted to respond with greater urgency, but found space and time hard to come by.Sreebhumi continued to look threatening, with Sibani Devi and Rimpa Haldar dictating proceedings from midfield.The confidence gained from a strong first half translated seamlessly into the second. Sreebhumi resumed with renewed intensity and doubled their advantage in the 59th minute. Haldar slipped a precise through ball into the penalty area, and Grace timed her run perfectly to guide the ball home.Gokulam's resistance faded further seven minutes later when Rimpa Haldar added a third.Picking up possession at the edge of the box, she showed composure to round goalkeeper Sowmiya N before rolling the ball into an empty net.The rout was completed in the 77th minute. A cross from the left caused chaos inside the Gokulam box, with Sowmiya initially saving Sibani Devi's effort and Anju Tamang clearing off the line. The danger was not fully averted, however, as Anju Chanu reacted quickly to loft the ball over the goalkeeper into the net.Garhwal United pip Kickstart==================In Kolkata, Garhwal United earned their second win in as many matches, defeating Kickstart FC Karnataka 1-0.Lhingdeikim (79th) scored the only goal of the match as newly promoted Garhwal United provisionally moved to the top of the table with six points from two matches -- two ahead of second-placed Nita Football Academy.","Sreebhumi FC registered a resounding 4-0 win over Gokulam Kerala FC in IWL.

Poll Do you think Aston Villa can win the Premier League this season? Yes, they have a strong chance No, they will fall short Not sure yet They need to improve further

Aston Villa continued their stunning Premier League title charge on Sunday as Morgan Rogers’ brilliant brace sealed a 2-1 victory over Manchester United at a raucous Villa Park, extending Unai Emery’s side’s extraordinary winning run.Rogers put Villa ahead late in the first half with a moment of individual brilliance before restoring the lead after the break, his goals securing a 10th consecutive victory in all competitions and keeping the Midlands club firmly in the title conversation.Third-placed Villa now sit just three points behind leaders Arsenal and one adrift of Manchester City, chasing what would be their first English league title since 1981. Their current run is their best in all competitions since 1914, while seven straight top-flight wins marks their strongest league streak since the 1989-90 season.Villa’s rise has been remarkable given their dismal start to the campaign, when they collected just two points and scored a single goal from their opening five matches — their worst beginning for 28 years. Under Emery, however, Villa Park has become a fortress, with only one Premier League home defeat in 2025, fewer than any other side.Even Manchester United, who had lost just once in their previous 26 visits to Villa, could not halt Emery’s momentum. United briefly responded after Villa’s opener, Matheus Cunha finishing clinically after Matty Cash gifted possession on the stroke of half-time.But the loss of captain Bruno Fernandes to an apparent hamstring injury at the interval proved decisive. Already depleted by injuries, suspension and Africa Cup of Nations absences, Ruben Amorim’s side lacked control after the break.Villa regained the lead in the 57th minute when Rogers showed greater hunger than Leny Yoro, pouncing on a loose ball in the box and finishing confidently for his sixth goal in as many league appearances. Emery celebrated wildly on the touchline, tossing his jacket skywards as Villa closed in on another statement win.United had chances to respond, with Emiliano Martinez producing key saves and Cunha wasting a gilt-edged header, but Villa held firm. Amorim handed a debut to teenager Jack Fletcher late on, yet the evening belonged to the hosts.",Aston Villa beat Manchester United 2-1 at Villa Park on Sunday.

Fans throw objects, vandalise stadium after Messi leaves early | Hyderabad next

NEW DELHI: Former India football captain Bhaichung Bhutia has strongly criticised the chaos that took place during Lionel Messi ’s public event at the Salt Lake Stadium in Kolkata.Speaking on Sunday, Bhutia called the incident unfortunate and said sports events should always be treated with importance, without unnecessary delays caused by politics or formalities.He said fans come to stadiums to enjoy the sport and watch their favourite players, not to sit through long speeches or wait for VIPs to arrive.“I think when there is a sports event, sports should get priority,” he said.He also pointed out that this problem is seen often across India. According to Bhutia, many sporting events are delayed because organisers wait for politicians or chief guests. He said such practices only harm the experience for fans and players.“Many times across India, we see sporting events getting delayed because of political speeches, chief guest handshakes and all that. That is not necessary. Fans and players are coming to watch the sport, and the sport should begin rather than waiting for VIPs.”Talking about Lionel Messi’s recent G.O.A.T. Tour of India, Bhutia said the response from fans clearly showed what people really want. He said fans in Kolkata and other cities only wanted to see Messi and enjoy the sport, without any extra drama.“It was good to see not just in Kolkata, but across different cities, fans just wanted to see the sporting event, who just wanted to see Messi and nothing else.”Bhutia hopes that what happened in Kolkata will act as a wake-up call for organisers and authorities in the future.“I hope this is a lesson we will learn and that this trend will change,” he added.The promotional event featuring Lionel Messi turned chaotic due to poor planning and crowd control.Thousands of fans were disappointed as politicians, celebrities and officials surrounded Messi, limiting his interaction with the public.His time on the field was also cut short. Frustrated by the situation, some spectators created disturbances inside the stadium.","Bhaichung Bhutia has strongly criticised the chaos that took place during Lionel Messi’s public event at the Salt Lake Stadium in Kolkata.

Erling Haaland continues to motor along at better than a goal a game for Manchester City in the Premier League His latest victim was West Ham on Saturday.The Norway striker scored in each half to move to 19 goals in 17 matches in this campaign and also set up Tijjani Reijnders' goal in a 3-0 win at Etihad Stadium on Saturday.The victory lifted City into first place, a point ahead of Arsenal before the deposed leader's match at Everton later Saturday.Haaland has 38 goals in a combined 28 games for club and country in what is shaping up to be the most prolific season of his career. Injury permitting, the season will end in him going to his first World Cup with Norway.His double gave him 104 in the Premier League, one more than Cristiano Ronaldo having played 122 games fewer.Haaland scored at the second attempt from Phil Foden's cross to give City a fifth-minute lead and took advantage of a defensive mix-up to make it 3-0 in the 69th. In between, Haaland slipped a short pass to Reijnders, who took a touch and rifled a shot into the roof of the net in the 38th.Woltemade's week What a difference a week made for Nick Woltemade.Last weekend, he scored an own-goal to consign Newcastle to a derby loss at fierce rival Sunderland.Six days later, he netted twice in the opening 20 minutes to give his team a fast start against Chelsea.Chelsea recovered, though, to draw 2-2 with Joao Pedro's equalizer coming off a rare assist from a goalkeeper.Robert Sanchez smashed a long clearance up to Pedro, who headed the ball forward and ended up collecting it himself after Fabian Schar slipped. Pedro slotted a finish underneath Newcastle goalkeeper Aaron Ramsdale to earn Chelsea a point in the 66th.""I wanted to give a good performance today and I think I did,"" Woltemade said. ""I just want to say thank you to the fans for still being good with me.""Reece James launched Chelsea's fightback by curling a free kick in off the post after halftime.Chelsea stayed in fourth place and has won only one of its last five games in the league.

Armando Broja grabbed Burnley's equalizer in the 90th.Sunderland is doing much better since promotion. A 0-0 draw at Brighton put the north-east team in fifth place.Remaining games There are three more games to be played on Saturday: Tottenham vs. Liverpool, followed by Everton vs. Arsenal and Leeds vs. Crystal Palace.",Erling Haaland scores twice in Manchester City's 3-0 win over West Ham.

NEW DELHI: Satadru Dutta, the main organiser of Lionel Messi’s event held on December 13 and now under arrest, has told investigators that the footballer was unhappy with physical contact during his appearance at the Salt Lake Stadium and left the venue before completing the scheduled programme, news agency PTI reported on Saturday, quoting a source in the Special Investigation Team (SIT).During questioning, Dutta told SIT officers that Messi ""did not like being touched on the back or being hugged"" and that this concern had been communicated in advance by foreign security officials assigned to protect the footballer, the source said.""Despite repeated public announcements to restrain the crowd, there was no impact. The manner in which Messi was surrounded and embraced was completely unacceptable to the World Cup-winning footballer,"" Dutta told investigators during his grilling on Friday, the source added, as cited by the PTI.West Bengal sports minister Aroop Biswas was seen close to Messi during the programme, with visuals showing him holding the footballer around the waist while posing for photographs. Biswas has been accused of using his influence to allow relatives and personal acquaintances access to Messi. Amid criticism, he resigned from his post as sports minister pending completion of the investigation.Investigators are examining how a large number of people were allowed to access the ground area.Dutta claimed that initially only 150 ground passes were issued, but the number was tripled after a ""very influential person"" arrived at the stadium and ""overpowered him"". Police are checking whether the increase in access led to the crowd control failure.""The arrested accused also claimed that once that particular influential person reached the stadium, all the flow-chart for the Messi programme got disturbed and he could not control it,"" the official told PTI.Dutta also shared financial details related to Messi’s India visit. ""Lionel Messi was paid Rs 89 crore for the tour, while Rs 11 crore was paid as tax to the Indian government,"" he told investigators, putting the total cost at Rs 100 crore. Sources said 30 per cent of the amount came from sponsors and another 30 per cent from ticket sales.SIT officers also found more than Rs 20 crore in Dutta’s frozen bank accounts. On Friday, they seized several documents during raids at his residence.""Dutta claimed that the amount in his bank account was the money which he got from selling the tickets for the Messi event in Kolkata and Hyderabad and also from the sponsors. We are verifying his claims,"" the officer said.What was supposed to be a marquee football spectacle turned into widespread violence and disorder at the stadium last week after Messi’s brief and tightly ring-fenced appearance, his first at the venue since 2011, left large sections of the crowd frustrated.They failed to catch a glimpse of their superstar despite having travelled from far and wide, paying hefty sums for tickets.The West Bengal government has formed an SIT comprising senior IPS officers Piyush Pandey, Javed Shamim, Supratim Sarkar and Muralidhar to investigate the vandalism, security lapses, access violations and the role of organisers and officials in the incident, the officer added.","Satadru Dutta, the main organiser of Lionel Messi’s event held on December 13 and now under arrest, has told investigators that the footballer was unhappy with physical contact.

Emotional Chiefs Travis Kelce Jokes Powerball & Love for KC Fans in Possible Final Home Game | Post

Travis Kelce’s career and future in the NFL



Travis Kelce, the Kansas City Chiefs tight end and fiancé of pop superstar Taylor Swift , had a playful moment during the Christmas Day press conference that quickly went viral. When asked if the Chiefs’ matchup against the Denver Broncos might be his last home game, Kelce didn’t dodge the question-he just added a humorous twist. “No. The only time it ever crossed my mind is [when] I was driving in the other day, and I saw how much the Powerball was, and I was like, ‘Man, if I could just win that, I wouldn’t have to work another day of my life,’” he quipped, drawing laughter from the room.Despite the joke, Kelce made it clear where his priorities lie. “No, man. Honestly, I’ve been just focused on trying to win football games, man. I’ll let that be a decision that I make with my family, friends, the Chiefs organization, when the time comes,” he added, emphasizing that his potential retirement isn’t a matter of finances or fame. While the Powerball jackpot hit $1.817 billion on Christmas Eve, the Chiefs star-worth roughly $90 million-remains committed to his team and family over the allure of instant wealth.Kelce, who has played for the Chiefs since 2013, has faced mounting speculation about his NFL future. This season brought unexpected challenges, including a season-ending ACL injury for star quarterback Patrick Mahomes and the Chiefs’ first absence from the playoffs in over a decade.Kelce admitted that this year left a “sour taste” in his mouth, and the team’s struggles have made retirement discussions more pressing.His brother, former Eagles player Jason Kelce, shared insight into the decision-making process, saying, “In my opinion, to nail that decision, you gotta step away from the game for a little bit. It’ll come to you with time.” Kelce himself recently discussed the future with retired Chiefs tight end Tony Gonzalez, weighing the factors that would convince him to play another season. With one final game left against the Las Vegas Raiders on Jan. 4, the football star remains focused on closing the season strong, keeping fans guessing about whether he will return to Arrowhead Stadium or step away for good.Also Read: ""Good human beings"": Chiefs’ Creed Humphrey shares how Patrick Mahomes and Travis Kelce bring great vibes that fuel the team culture","Travis Kelce jokes hitting the Powerball would let him retire instantly.

Kirk Herbstreit exposes Broncos QB Bo Nix’s dog phobia after awkward encounter at Denver game,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/kirk-herbstreit-exposes-broncos-qb-bo-nixs-dog-phobia-after-awkward-encounter-at-denver-game/articleshow/126198544.cms,"Bo Nix fears of dogs (Getty Images)

Denver’s quarterback turns “overdog” into a cause



Bo Nix, the Denver Broncos quarterback, has been fearless on the field all season, but off it, he admits some fears are there in his mind- especially when it comes to dogs. The 25-year-old recently confronted that fear during a playful interaction with ESPN analyst Kirk Herbstreit’s golden retriever, Peter, right before Denver’s Christmas Day showdown against the Kansas City Chiefs. “It’s just not my thing,” Nix confessed, opening up about why dogs have always made him uneasy.For Nix, the hesitation isn’t about being aloof- it stems from a childhood incident. “I just think when I was little I got attacked by one, and I didn't know any better,"" he explained. “My family didn't grow up with them. My whole family's not really a dog family. We had one when I was a kid, and then it passed away and we didn't get a new one."" What followed was a viral moment months ago when Nix appeared standoffish with Peter, sparking social media criticism. On Thursday, however, the quarterback made amends, gently petting the dog while admitting, “My wife will be shocked.”Bo Nix isn’t just showing bravery with pets- he’s redefining it on the field. After leading the Broncos to a stunning 34-26 victory over the Green Bay Packers, the quarterback jokingly dubbed the team “overdogs.”The term has stuck, and Nix has turned it into more than a meme. Through his “Overdogs” apparel line, a portion of proceeds will benefit the Denver Rescue Mission, supporting efforts to combat homelessness across Metro Denver and Northern Colorado.While Broncos fans are focused on playoff positioning, Nix is proving his courage goes beyond football. After Christmas Day’s win over the Chiefs, Denver holds a 13-3 record, on track to secure the AFC’s top seed. And though NFL defenses don’t intimidate him, a friendly canine companion was a different challenge- one that Nix now seems willing to face. Between leading the Broncos and supporting local causes, Bo Nix is showing fans that overcoming fears- whether on the field or off- can inspire both victory and compassion.Also Read: Jordan Love faces backlash after gifting teammates 'cheap' sneakers for Christmas despite earning a massive $55 million salary","Bo Nix, the Denver Broncos quarterback, has been fearless on the field all season, but admits some fears are there in his mind- especially when it comes to dogs.

Ann Michael Maye (Instagram)

Drake Maye stands at the center of New England’s late season urgency, and the message coming out of Foxborough could not be more direct. With two games left, the Patriots are not measuring success in small steps or moral victories. The goal is larger, louder, and rooted in legacy. This team wants control of its division back, and its young quarterback is not hiding from that expectation.There is no hesitation in the locker room tone as New England heads into a decisive stretch. The Patriots already secured a playoff spot, but the conversation has shifted beyond clinching. It is about finishing with authority, owning hostile stadiums, and reminding the AFC East that the road still runs through them.“It’s as simple as go win the division,” Maye said. “That’s what the goal was. It wasn’t to make the playoffs. It was to win the division, and that’s what we’re going to try to do.”The Patriots enter Sunday’s matchup against the struggling New York Jets at 12-3, with a rare opportunity to lock up the AFC East for the first time since 2019. A win at MetLife Stadium, combined with a Buffalo stumble against Philadelphia, would seal it.Even a tie could do the job under the right circumstances. Beyond the standings, another road victory would keep New England perfect away from home at 8-0, a feat achieved only twice before in franchise history.While Maye drives the Patriots toward a division crown, his wife Ann Michael Maye is carving out her own lane away from game plans and scoreboards. After weeks of holiday themed social media moments that captured the attention of fans, she has shifted focus with purpose. The North Carolina native traded festive pajamas for a sleek black cocktail dress to support Dressember, a campaign that uses fashion to raise awareness about human trafficking and violence.Through Instagram Stories, she highlighted the cause with sobering context, noting that roughly 500,000 children in the Philippines alone were trafficked to produce exploitation material. “That's enough children to fill 10,000 school buses.”Her growing confidence online has not gone unnoticed, especially as Patriots fans have embraced her authenticity. Some even call her the Queen of New England, a title rooted in relatability rather than spectacle.""She's just being herself,"" Maye said recently. ""I love her for it. I tell her that all the time, 'Don't change for anything.'""As New England pushes toward a division title, the Mayes continue to resonate for different reasons. One leads with precision on Sundays. The other uses visibility to spotlight causes that matter. Together, they reflect a franchise finding its voice again.Also Read: ""Good human beings"": Chiefs’ Creed Humphrey shares how Patrick Mahomes and Travis Kelce bring great vibes that fuel the team culture","Drake Maye and Ann Michael Maye reflect leadership on and off the field for the New England Patriots.

Shilo Sanders calls out “stepmom” Karrueche Tran after Deion Sanders skips his Christmas gift,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/shilo-sanders-calls-out-stepmom-karrueche-tran-after-deion-sanders-skips-his-christmas-gift/articleshow/126198140.cms,"Shilo Sanders joked on his YouTube channel after noticing all the Christmas gifts at Deion Sanders’ house were labeled for Karrueche Tran, leaving him empty-handed. Laughing off the moment, Shilo teased Tran as his “stepmom,” fueling online buzz about Deion’s rumored relationship while showing a lighthearted family dynamic.

Shilo Sanders jokes about Karrueche Tran stealing the Christmas spotlight

Shilo Sanders did not expect Christmas at his father’s house to turn into a lighthearted roast, but that is exactly what happened. Instead of unwrapping presents, the NFL free agent found himself staring at stacks of neatly wrapped gifts that were clearly meant for someone else. The moment quickly became a family joke, captured on camera and shared with fans who know the Sanders household rarely lacks humor.It was a laid-back moment, and Shilo handled it with jokes rather than any real disappointment. He laughed, leaned into the humor, and showed he was at ease poking fun at himself and his dad. At the same time, the moment quietly reminded viewers how Deion Sanders’ personal life continues to attract attention beyond the game.While filming a video for his YouTube channel, Shilo noticed that nearly every gift was labeled for his father’s girlfriend. Laughing as he scanned the room, he summed it up bluntly. “Bro, everything says Mrs. K on here,” he said. “That means Karrueche. She has so much stuff. What if all this is just for her? And I didn't get anything?”The comment instantly made waves online, blending humor with ongoing interest in Deion Sanders’ rumored relationship with actress Karrueche Tran.Though neither Deion nor Tran has publicly confirmed their romance, the two have been linked for months. Tran was seen earlier this year asking fans to pray for Deion ahead of his bladder cancer surgery, and later hinted on a podcast that she was happily dating someone.“I’m at a point in my life, like, I know what I want,"" Tran said. ""I’ve dated a lot. I’ve done a lot. I’ve did this, did that. Young, old. And so, if I wasn’t happy and content, and feeling good in my situation, I’m not wasting my time.”Shilo also recalled how Deion first introduced Tran to him, sharing another moment that leaned more funny than serious. “I remember when I first met Karruenche, dad said, 'Say hello to your stepmom,'” he said.Away from the jokes, Shilo continues to work toward his NFL future after a brief stint with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. For now, though, his Christmas story offered something simpler. A reminder that even in a high-profile family, holiday moments can still be messy, funny, and very real.Also Read: Shilo Sanders opens up on first meeting with Deion Sanders’ girlfriend Karrueche Tran, plans to ask quirky question on dad’s toes","Shilo Sanders joked about Karrueche Tran stealing the Christmas spotlight at his father's house.

With retirement speculation growing and the season nearing its end, his emotional entrance at Arrowhead Stadium stood out during what could be his final home game, highlighting loyalty amid uncertainty.

Travis Kelce turns a Christmas tunnel walk into a statement moment

Travis Kelce arrived at Arrowhead Stadium on Christmas Day with more weight on his shoulders than usual. As retirement rumors continued to swirl and the Chiefs faced what might be his last home game of the season, the veteran tight end made his entrance count. Wearing the team’s colors from head to toe, his walk through the tunnel felt personal and purposeful. It was more than a style choice. It reflected his bond with Kansas City, the moment, and the journey that brought him there.The moment landed heavier given the Chiefs’ difficult season. Kansas City entered the game already eliminated from playoff contention for the first time in a decade. Injuries, close losses, and shifting expectations defined the year. Against that backdrop, Kelce’s arrival felt symbolic, like a quiet acknowledgment of uncertainty while still honoring the team and city that shaped his 13 year career.Kelce wore a red Chiefs Essentials sweatshirt layered under a long black trench coat, paired with black pants and matching shoes. The look blended comfort with purpose, drawing attention without demanding it. The choice of red on Christmas Day felt intentional, especially as rumors swirl that this could be his last appearance at Arrowhead Stadium.While Kelce has avoided giving a clear answer about retirement, those closest to him have weighed in. His brother Jason Kelce has publicly shared thoughts on the decision, while head coach Andy Reid has acknowledged the emotional weight surrounding the game. Kelce himself has kept the focus on football and his teammates, even as questions continue to follow him.The emotions of the season came into sharper focus after Patrick Mahomes suffered a season ending ACL injury earlier this month. On his New Heights podcast, Kelce did not hide the impact. “It's never easy seeing your guys go down. We had a bunch of guys get hurt this past game, and we fought, man. We fought.” He added about Mahomes’ injury, “And on a freakish play to see one five go down like that, man, it f------, it was almost like it wasn't real. And s--- just sucks, man.”As the Chiefs prepare for their final regular season game, Kelce’s Christmas entrance lingers. Not because of the price tag or the labels, but because it felt like a quiet salute. To the fans. To the stadium. And possibly to a chapter nearing its end.Also Read: Travis Kelce reveals the unexpected habit of Taylor Swift that quietly changed his health","Travis Kelce wore a red Chiefs Essentials sweatshirt on Christmas Day.

Who was John Madden?

About the Madden movie teaser

Madden movie energy hits immediately, not with nostalgia, but with swagger. The first teaser does not whisper about legacy. It announces it. Airing during NFL Christmas Day games, the preview wastes no time reminding viewers why John Madden still looms over football, broadcasting, and gaming culture. The film does not frame him as a relic. It frames him as a force. Loud, brilliant, stubborn, and joyful.The teaser opens the door to a story that feels bigger than football. It leans into personality, obsession, and invention. Nicolas Cage appears completely transformed, not just physically, but in presence. The voice, posture, and sheer mass of the man feel lived in. This is not imitation. It is interpretation. The timing matters too. In an era flooded with sports biopics, this one chooses a bolder lane by treating Madden as a cultural architect, not just a coach.John Madden (1936-2021) still shapes the way football is watched, taught, and remembered decades after his greatest wins.From the opening snap of his coaching career to his final broadcast booth appearance, John Madden carried football with an infectious joy that never felt forced. He turned the Oakland Raiders into champions, guiding them to a historic Super Bowl XI victory, and later transformed living rooms into classrooms with his sharp yet friendly breakdowns of the game.His voice felt familiar, his lessons simple, and his passion impossible to miss.Away from the sideline, Madden bridged generations. He helped translate football for casual fans, young players, and gamers alike, making the sport accessible without stripping away its soul. Few figures have influenced how football is played, explained, and consumed across so many platforms.His impact stretched beyond trophies and ratings. As NFL commissioner Roger Goodell said, ""Nobody loved football more than Coach,"" adding, ""There will never be another John Madden, and we will forever be indebted to him for all he did to make football and the NFL what it is today."" Madden’s legacy lives on in every broadcast, playbook, and game controller he inspired. Madden won 16 Emmy Awards and covered 11 Super Bowls from 1979 to 2009. He was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2006.“There’s only one John Madden – they didn’t make another one!”That line lands because it is true. Madden was never only about wins or losses. He was about how the game felt, how it sounded, and how it could be shared. The teaser suggests a film more interested in momentum than milestones. It moves fast, yet lets moments breathe. Super Bowl triumph blends into late nights, chalkboards, microphones, and eventually pixels.What separates the Madden movie from routine biopics is its focus on creation. The story stretches from Oakland’s raw sideline intensity to the unlikely birth of a video game that redefined sports entertainment. The film frames Madden NFL not as a side project, but as a second act powered by curiosity and refusal to slow down.A synopsis for Madden says it “follows Madden’s remarkable journey — from his Super Bowl-winning partnership with Al Davis and the Raiders, to creating Madden NFL, and becoming one of the most iconic voices in football history.”Christian Bale’s Al Davis looks sharp-edged and relentless, a perfect counterweight to Madden’s booming warmth. Their dynamic promises tension, loyalty, and collision. Around them, Kathryn Hahn, John Mulaney, and Sienna Miller fill out a world that feels textured and alive rather than staged.Director David O. Russell frames the soul of the film clearly.“Nicolas Cage, one of our greatest and most original actors, will portray the best of the American spirit of originality, fun and determination in which anything is possible as beloved national legend John Madden,” Russell said in a statement in August 2024.“Together with the ferocious style, focus and inspired individualism of Al Davis, owner of the underdog Oakland Raiders, the feature will be about the joy, humanity and genius that was John Madden in a wildly inventive, cool world of the 1970s.”The Madden movie does not aim to explain why John Madden mattered. It assumes you know. It shows you why he still does.Also Read: ""Good human beings"": Chiefs’ Creed Humphrey shares how Patrick Mahomes and Travis Kelce bring great vibes that fuel the team culture","John Madden (1936-2021) still shapes the way football is watched, taught, and remembered decades after his greatest wins.

The holiday outing marked a rare public reunion focused on co-parenting amid ongoing legal proceedings tied to a domestic dispute. The moment highlighted shared parenting despite personal and legal challenges.

Tyreek Hill and Keeta Vaccaro show united parenting at Christmas Wonderland

Tyreek Hill and Keeta Vaccaro came together again this Christmas, not as a couple, but as parents choosing to show up for their child. Months after their separation became public, the former couple stepped into a festive setting with one clear focus: their daughter, Capri. For followers watching from afar, it was a rare glimpse of cooperation after months defined by separation and legal strain.The timing mattered. Nearly eight months after divorce papers were filed, the holiday outing carried emotional weight without making declarations. No captions tried to rewrite the past. No explanations followed. Instead, photos told a softer story of two people navigating parenthood during a complicated chapter, choosing calm in a season usually tied to family and reflection.The Christmas Wonderland visit at Miami’s Tropical Park placed the focus squarely on Capri. Images shared through her Instagram account showed Tyreek Hill holding his daughter near glowing decorations and later sitting with her in front of a Ferris wheel.Keeta Vaccaro appeared in nearby photos, smiling beside illuminated displays. The setting felt intentional. Public, joyful, and centered on a child who remains their shared priority.The outing also marked Hill’s first Christmas celebration with Capri in nearly five months. Earlier that day, he shared quieter moments indoors, wearing headphones as Capri sat close by in a red and white outfit topped with a bow. Vaccaro later posted similar images, reinforcing the sense of coordination rather than coincidence.Their public togetherness stood in contrast to the difficult events that followed their separation. Court filings and police reports detailed a tense domestic dispute earlier this year, though authorities confirmed Capri was found healthy and Hill was not charged. One statement from the report continues to echo online. “I have the same rights as a father as her as a mother, and I can take my baby whenever I want.”Since then, life has moved forward in parallel paths. Hill is recovering from a severe knee injury that ended his season, while legal proceedings outline significant financial support for Vaccaro and their daughter.Against that backdrop, the Christmas reunion did not attempt to resolve the past. It offered something simpler. A reminder that even amid conflict, shared moments with a child can still create warmth, stability, and memory.Also Read: Who is Keeta Vaccaro?

Travis Kelce’s controversial 2010 college suspension resurfaces as retirement rumors continue to grow,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/travis-kelces-controversial-2010-college-suspension-resurfaces-as-retirement-rumors-continue-to-grow/articleshow/126183182.cms,"Travis Kelce's football future was nearly derailed by a college suspension. This setback forced him to grow up and embrace a new position. He moved from quarterback to tight end, a change that redefined his career. This early lesson in accountability now feels relevant as Kelce considers his NFL future.

A college setback that reshaped Travis Kelce’s mindset and career trajectory

As retirement chatter swirls around Travis Kelce following a rare down year for the Kansas City Chiefs, an old chapter from his college days has quietly resurfaced and it offers a deeper lens into how he became the player fans know today. Long before Super Bowls, pop-culture fame, and record-breaking playoff runs, Kelce faced a moment that nearly derailed his football future.As Kelce weighs what could be his final NFL decision, that early setback feels newly relevant.While playing at the University of Cincinnati, Kelce was suspended for the entire 2010 season after failing a drug test just days before the Sugar Bowl. At the time, he wasn’t even a tight end, he was still listed as a quarterback, trying to find his place on the roster. The suspension forced him off the depth chart and into football limbo, but it also created unexpected clarity.Reflecting years later, Kelce admitted the moment forced him to grow up fast, saying it made him realize he “gotta tighten the f*** up.” Instead of transferring or walking away, he accepted a humbling role on the scout team. That year away from games pushed coaches to see him less as a passer and more as a raw athlete with size, speed, and instincts traits that would eventually redefine the tight end position in the NFL.The move proved transformative. When Kelce returned, he embraced the tight end role fully, developing into a matchup nightmare that later became his calling card with the Chiefs. In many ways, the suspension didn’t stall his career, it redirected it.Now, at 36, with Kansas City missing the playoffs and Kelce openly reflecting on letting down head coach Andy Reid, that early lesson in accountability feels full circle.

The foundation's initiatives, like Read for 15 and Volunteer for 15, foster positive development in young people.

How Patrick Mahomes’ foundation became a source of pride beyond football

As the Kansas City Chiefs grind through a demanding NFL season, Brittany Mahomes has increasingly drawn attention for something far removed from wins, losses, or playoff math. While criticism and pressure often follow Patrick Mahomes on the field, his work away from football has continued to grow quietly and steadily.Recent recognition tied to his charitable efforts highlighted a side of the Chiefs quarterback that doesn’t show up on stat sheets. For Brittany, that impact appears to matter just as much, if not more, than the weekly noise surrounding the team.Patrick Mahomes’ 15 and the Mahomies Foundation has reached a stage where its influence is measurable, visible, and increasingly community-driven. Its partner organization, Youth Volunteer Corps has recently published annual estimates of 92, 714 hours of volunteer work done by young people equating to the community value of an estimated 3.2 million dollars. Brittany Mahomes made the most of such an achievement with a very modest yet informative gesture, as she interacted with the post, expanding its popularity.The numbers only tell part of the story. For many volunteers, Mahomes’ example has become personal motivation. Luke from Hampton explained why the quarterback’s leadership resonates with him.“Patrick Mahomes has inspired me to volunteer because of the way he uses his platform to give back to the community (being a core sponsor of Youth Volunteer Corps).“Beyond his talent on the field, he demonstrates leadership, generosity, and a commitment to helping others, showing success comes with the responsibility to make a positive impact,” Luke said.The philosophy has formed the growing programs of the foundation. Programs such as Read for 15 will help young children develop the reading habit on a daily basis, and Volunteer for 15 will expose older students to organized community service. Another branch, 15 for 15, provides funding across academics, science, athletics, and the arts.Earlier this fall, Patrick and Brittany Mahomes hosted the sixth annual 15 and the Mahomies Foundation Gala, drawing more than 900 supporters and raising $1.5 million for 27 local charities. As football narratives fluctuate, the foundation’s steady growth offers a reminder that Mahomes’ influence and Brittany’s pride in it extends well beyond Arrowhead Stadium.Also Read: Randi Mahomes’ powerful reaction to Brittany’s holiday surprise quickly caught fans’ attention","Patrick Mahomes' 15 and the Mahomies Foundation is making a significant community impact.

“Not talk to anyone”: Hailee Steinfeld opens up about struggling with anxiety as she and Josh Allen expect their first child,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/not-talk-to-anyone-hailee-steinfeld-opens-up-about-struggling-with-anxiety-as-she-and-josh-allen-expect-their-first-child/articleshow/126182245.cms,"Hailee Steinfeld's candid discussion on anxiety, emphasizing a 'gentle pause' over constant action, has struck a chord. She advocates for intentional stillness to manage stress, a refreshing approach against hustle culture. Her reflections on learning on her own terms and prioritizing mental well-being offer a grounded perspective on navigating public life and professional demands.

Why Hailee Steinfeld’s “gentle pause” approach resonated long after the headlines faded

When Hailee Steinfeld spoke openly about anxiety earlier this year, the moment stood out precisely because it wasn’t dramatic or headline-chasing. At the time, the actress and singer was navigating a packed professional schedule while also adjusting to heightened public attention as the fiancée of Buffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen Rather than presenting anxiety as a buzzword or branding tool, Steinfeld framed it as something nuanced and often misunderstood. Looking back now, her comments feel less like a trend-driven confession and more like a grounded reminder of how mental health conversations can evolve with honesty and restraint.In her Beau Society newsletter, Steinfeld reflected on how casually people often use the word anxiety before fully understanding it. She acknowledged that earlier in life she lumped stress, pressure, and anxiety together, only later realizing they weren’t the same experience. That distinction shaped how she learned to cope.Rather than forcing productivity during anxious moments, Steinfeld described choosing intentional stillness. “I take a step away from whatever is making me feel that way, sit, and do nothing,” she shared. She pushed back against the idea that anxiety must be met with action, adding, “You can curl up with your favorite blanket and not talk to anyone for ten minutes.Take a gentle pause.”The simplicity of that advice resonated because it ran counter to hustle culture, especially for someone balancing Hollywood expectations and proximity to the NFL spotlight. Her comments also aligned with another unconventional choice she revisited: leaving traditional schooling early. Steinfeld explained how homeschooling allowed her to learn on her own terms, noting, “I really enjoyed math, but I always found my own way to get to the answer. ”With time, her reflections feel less like a personal revelation and more like a broader philosophy. In an environment that rewards constant visibility, whether on screen, on stage, or on the sidelines, Steinfeld’s emphasis on slowing down quietly challenged the assumption that success requires nonstop motion.Also Read: Hailee Steinfeld and Josh Allen are expecting their first baby as they begin life beyond the spotlight","Hailee Steinfeld spoke openly about anxiety earlier this year.

Inside Bry Burrows ’ life: Education, Professional rise, and How she met with Jalen Hurts

From Engagement to Wedding: Jalen Hurts’ love story with Bry Burrows



Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts is married, and the spotlight has firmly turned toward the woman who has been part of his journey long before the wedding headlines. Bryonna “Bry” Rivera Burrows is more than just the wife of an NFL star. She has built an impressive professional career while standing beside Hurts through some of the defining moments of his football life.They first gathered media attention in January 2023 when Burrows appeared on the field with Hurts after the Eagles won their NFC Championship victory. Until then, Hurts had been careful about keeping his private life separate from his career. When he did speak about their relationship, he spoke with rare certainty, saying he had known long ago that she was the right person for him.Hurts and Burrows met at the University of Alabama, where both were students. Although Hurts established himself as a great collegian before transferring to play for Oklahoma, Burrows was more interested in academics and leadership. A member of Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc., she began her career with IBM and steadily climbed the corporate ladder, working in consulting, technology strategy, software financing, and later becoming an Artificial Intelligence partner.Her career path reflects ambition, intelligence, and stability, qualities that complement Hurts’ disciplined professional identity.Their relationship wasn’t rushed. It moved through its own phases over the years, strengthening with time. Even as Hurts’ NFL profile expanded, Burrows built her career away from the spotlight, appearing publicly only when the moment truly mattered. Over time, the couple began sharing more appearances together, including the Time100 Next Gala, film premieres, and major cultural events.Their engagement became public in 2024, when Burrows was spotted wearing a ring at the Eagles’ season opener. Soon after that, the two confirmed this and began to appear in public places together. The most important event for both of them took place in February 2025, when Philadelphia beat Kansas City in the Super Bowl. Burrows celebrated with Hurts on the field, symbolizing the fact that his personal life was now entwined with his success on the field.The pair got married in the spring of 2025 and eventually stepped onto the red carpet at the Met Gala. This marked another important event in a relationship founded upon several years of history and growth. However, for all people wondering who Jalen Hurts’ wife is, Bry Burrows, is all evidence of strength and many years of partnership founded upon his own growth within the NFL.Also Read: Jalen Hurts vs Bry Burrows Net Worth: A detailed look at the NFL star couple’s wealth","Bryonna ""Bry"" Rivera Burrows is the wife of Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts.

“Her toxic divorce was…”: Gisele Bündchen found peace after divorce as Tom Brady’s life after football turned uncertain,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/her-toxic-divorce-was-gisele-bndchen-found-peace-after-divorce-as-tom-bradys-life-after-football-turned-uncertain/articleshow/126182091.cms,"Gisele Bündchen and Tom Brady's divorce marked a turning point. Bündchen embraced a private life, finding emotional clarity and new love. Brady transitioned to broadcasting and ownership. Both focused on co-parenting. Their separation appears as a realignment of lives, one seeking quiet fulfillment, the other reinvention.

How Gisele Bündchen found peace, purpose, and new love after leaving a public marriage

When Gisele Bündchen and Tom Brady finalized their divorce in October 2022, it marked the end of one of the most scrutinized relationships in sports and entertainment. At the time, public attention focused on what went wrong. With distance, however, a clearer picture has emerged of how both moved forward in very different ways.Bündchen stepped into a more private, grounded phase centered on emotional clarity and family, while Brady redirected his legendary competitiveness toward broadcasting and ownership. Looking back now, the separation appears less like a rupture and more like a turning point for both.In the years following the divorce, sources close to Bündchen suggested the supermodel experienced a profound emotional shift. According to Life & Style, she felt an immediate connection with jiu-jitsu instructor Joaquim Valente, with one source saying he “has felt right to her from the beginning” and that “everything seemed easy and organic.” The relationship reportedly offered something she felt was missing for years.“She wasn’t sure she would ever have feelings like this again, and to have it happen so soon after her toxic divorce was a surprise,” the source said.Another revealing detail added, “Gisele finally feels seen,” hinting at emotional gaps that lingered during her 13-year marriage.By the time news of her pregnancy surfaced, it was clear this wasn’t a fleeting rebound but a deliberate step forward. Reports reportedly shared that “Friends are saying she calls Joaquim her soulmate,” and marriage was something she envisioned after welcoming their child.In the meantime, Brady became another person in terms of professional identity. Taking the place of the field by the broadcast booth, he initially received early criticism but was still in the limelight, calling both the big NFL matches with a minority stake in the Las Vegas raiders. Even without any romantic ties, Bundchen and Brady were still involved in sharing their children, and they continued their concentration on their children as stabilized.Reflectively, this chapter does not read as a tale of a break up, but of two lives revisiting, one to silent satisfaction, the other reinventing following football.Also Read: Tom Brady’s ex-wife Gisele Bündchen turns heads as she redefines bold fashion in an effortless gold look","Gisele Bündchen and Tom Brady finalized their divorce in October 2022.

Austin Reaves injury update: Lakers guard sidelined for multiple games amid calf strain,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nba/top-stories/austin-reaves-injury-update-lakers-guard-sidelined-for-multiple-games-amid-calf-strain/articleshow/126198913.cms,"Austin Reaves.

Austin Reaves injury update and return timeline



The Los Angeles Lakers must adjust without Austin Reaves



Austin Reaves’ strong season run came to an abrupt pause on Christmas Day. The Los Angeles Lakers guard exited at halftime against the Houston Rockets with renewed calf soreness, and follow-up testing confirmed a setback far more serious than first hoped. Earlier, it was expected to be just a caution, but a new report indicates a clear absence at a critical stretch of the schedule.Reaves had recently returned after missing games earlier this month and was playing without a minutes limit. He looked controlled early, scoring efficiently before the discomfort returned. By Friday, the team confirmed that the injury would sideline him for multiple games.As per a report by Dan Woike of The Athletic, it was revealed that Austin Reaves suffered a Grade 2 strain in his left calf and will be re-evaluated in approximately four weeks. The injury forced him out after halftime against Houston, one day after he had reclaimed his spot in the starting lineup. Reaves finished with 12 points in 15 first-half minutes before being ruled out with left calf soreness.ESPN’s Shams Charania also confirmed, “Los Angeles Lakers guard Austin Reaves has been diagnosed with a grade 2 left gastrocnemius strain and will be reevaluated in four weeks.”This diagnosis explains the cautious language that followed his earlier return.Reaves had already missed three games with what the team initially labeled a mild strain. The re-injury changes the picture. He is now expected to miss at least a month, with the earliest possible return lining up near the start of the Lakers’ Grammy road trip later in January.Luka Dončić, who has dealt with a similar injury, offered perspective after the game.“I know how it is to go to a calf injury. It’s not fun at all,” Dončić said. “[I’ll] just be there to support him. Take your time. Calves are dangerous so take your time.”Around the league, calf injuries have drawn closer attention following multiple Achilles tears last postseason. Teams have grown increasingly careful, and the Lakers appear set to take that approach with Reaves.Reaves’ absence will create a huge gap in the roster. He entered the week averaging a career high of 26.2 points per game while serving as the team’s second-leading scorer. Losing that production comes as the Lakers ride their first losing streak of the season and search for defensive stability.Coach JJ Redick has already signaled tougher internal conversations after recent blowout losses. With Reaves sidelined, the rotation will shift. Marcus Smart, Dalton Knecht, and potentially Bronny James are positioned for expanded roles in the backcourt alongside Dončić. Offensive responsibility will lean even heavier on Dončić and LeBron James.Also Read: Austin Reaves gets heartfelt support from Lakers’ bestie Luka Dončić amid calf injury","Los Angeles Lakers guard Austin Reaves suffered a calf strain against the Houston Rockets.

Luka Dončić sent a heartfelt message to his Lakers' buddy Austin Reaves



Austin Reaves and Luka Dončić are new best friends in the Lakers



Austin Reaves’ Christmas night ended early. The Los Angeles Lakers suffered a heavy loss to the Houston Rockets. The blow extended when team watched one of its most reliable guards, Austin Reaves, leave the floor before halftime, clutching the same calf that had sidelined him earlier this month.As medical evaluations loomed, Reaves received immediate backing from someone who knows the toll of that injury better than most. Luka Dončić , his new best pal, shared his honest and heartfelt message for Reaves as he is recovering for a stronger comeback to lift the roster from heavy heartbreaks.Austin Reaves was ruled out after halftime with left calf soreness. Following the game, Luka Dončić confirmed that Reaves would undergo further testing and extened his support.“I talked to him,” Luka said. “He just said he didn’t know. He’ll have an MRI tomorrow. I just said, ‘If you need something to help, I know what it is to go through calf injury.’ It’s not fun at all. Just be there to support him. Calf (injuries) are dangerous so just take your time.”Medical clarity arrived soon after. Reaves was diagnosed with a Grade 2 left gastrocnemius strain and is expected to be re-evaluated in roughly four weeks.His absence leaves a noticeable gap. Reaves entered the game averaging over 26 points per night, and his efficiency and playmaking have been vital to the Lakers’ offense. With him sidelined, the burden shifts further onto Dončić and LeBron James while the rotation adjusts.The connection between Reaves and Dončić has grown rapidly since Luka’s arrival in Los Angeles. Their chemistry shows up during games, but it is rooted in genuine trust off the court.“We act like we're probably 10-year old best friends,” Reaves told ESPN recently. “You have a deeper care for one another than just basketball. And then that bleeds into basketball, because you don't want to let that person down. ... You don't want to not give it your all.”Dončić also shared his thoughts on the friendship. “We kind of understand each other -- what the other is going to do. So I would say it's a little bit natural.”Reaves is reportedly sidelined for at least a month with a calf injury.Also Read: “He does nothing” — Ex-NBA coach delivers rare Luka Doncic criticism while comparing him to Stephen Curry",Luka Dončić sent a heartfelt message to his Lakers' buddy Austin Reaves.

Sam Mitchell slams Luka Doncic in his comparison to Stephen Curry



Who is Sam Mitchell?



Yes, Luka Doncic gets slammed, too. Doncic’s numbers have been impressive, and he has been adding records to his name. However, a blunt assessment from a former NBA coach has put him in a different light. Certainly, Doncic is one of the faces of the league and the Los Angeles Lakers, but he is not far from criticism for his gameplay either.The remarks arrived at a sensitive moment for the Lakers. Recent losses, including a devastating Christmas Day defeat, have magnified concerns around ball movement, defensive strategies, and offensive flow. Of course, their position in the standings is still favorable; however, scrutiny has followed the team’s stars. Recently, Sam Mitchell, a legend in the league and former basketball coach, showered his unfiltered criticism on Doncic.Speaking on SiriusXM NBA Radio, former NBA Coach of the Year Sam Mitchell shared his direct stance on Luka Doncic. His critique focused on off-ball activity and how elite players influence teammates without controlling every possession.“Luka Doncic cannot play basketball without the ball. He don’t cut, he don’t move, he don’t set screens.He’s great with the ball -- he does nothing to make his teammates better when he doesn’t have it. And the problem with the Lakers is, Austin Reaves and LeBron James are the same way. They gotta have the ball, because they don't want to do the hard things -- pass, cut, move, set screens.”Mitchell then pointed to Stephen Curry as a contrasting example of superstar impact away from the ball.“The reason we give Steph Curry so much credit is not because he’s a traditional great point guard. He averages about four and a half to five assists per game for his career. Steph Curry do the hard things. He’s always cutting and moving without the ball, which—when you’re a great player and you make a hard cut—somebody’s going to follow you.”The numbers provide context to Mitchell’s argument. Los Angeles ranks near the bottom of the league in assists per game despite elite shooting efficiency.

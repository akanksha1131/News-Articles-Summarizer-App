EXCLUSIVE | Shreyas Iyer and Yuzvendra Chahal key to Punjab Kings' hunt for maiden IPL title: Shashank Singh

NEW DELHI: It is that time of the year. Indian Premier League (IPL) 2025 is set to kick off -- but with a host of rule changes, many of which have already drawn attention.While most of the recent updates make sense to an extent, both current and former players are keen to see how the changes pan out over the next two months.Among the headline-grabbing rules are: the return of saliva to shine the ball and the introduction of a second ball for the second innings in evening matches.With these new regulations in place, certain questions have started creeping into the equation: What was the need for these new norms? How could these benefit the players -- bowlers in this case? And are these rules a game-changer or gimmick?""If you look at it, saliva is used less on a new ball; sweat is used more because the new white ball is lighter,"" Parvinder Awana, who played three IPL seasons for Kings XI Punjab, toldOver the past few seasons, 200-plus scores have become routine in the IPL, thanks to flat wickets and flamboyant bravado of the batters. The Impact Player rule made a significant difference last season.Bowlers, particularly pacers, have struggled to get much purchase off the surface with the white ball.The lifting of the saliva ban might just tilt the balance slightly in their favour.""When the ball gets a bit older, one side needs to be made slightly heavier for reverse swing. That’s when saliva is applied, and it helps the ball shine better,"" the 38-year-old explained.""The red ball shines more because its leather is softer. The white ball is harder, and its shine wears off quickly. It swings early on, but as it ages, the swing reduces.""However, for saliva to be effective, the playing surface needs to be conducive to reverse swing. That means some wear and tear on the pitch -- and on one side of the ball.""If the pitch and ground conditions are a bit rough, and if some saliva is applied to shine one side while keeping the other side rough, the ball will reverse swing,"" Awana elaborated.While it remains to be seen how much of a difference saliva can make, the introduction of a second ball in the second innings of evening games is expected to bring noticeable relief for bowlers.By giving bowlers a worn-down ball after the 11th over of the second innings, the second ball rule aims to counter the dew factor -- a perennial issue in night matches.This move is expected to restore some balance between bat and ball, and reduce the toss advantage often gained by the chasing side.""In evening matches, there's usually dew. So if a second new ball is used, it would help bowlers with grip. And a new ball could also swing,"" Awana pointed out.READ ALSO: Don't think Virat Kohli necessarily turned down RCB's captaincy: AB de Villiers However, the implementation of this change is not automatic.The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) has left the decision on ball replacement to the discretion of the on-field umpires.While acknowledging the potential impact of this move, Awana is cautiously optimistic and keen to observe how it plays out in real-timeHe concluded, ""As a fast bowler myself, it’s a good thing for bowlers; it’s something new. Let’s see how it plays out when the season starts.""","IPL 2025 is set to kick off with a host of rule changes, many of which have already drawn attention.

NEW DELHI: The pressure will undoubtedly be on Shubman Gill to guide Gujarat Titans back into the playoffs—and ultimately, to their second IPL title. Expectations are high, thanks to the franchise's impressive past performances.Making their IPL debut in 2022, Gujarat Titans, under Hardik Pandya’s captaincy, scripted history by winning the title in their very first season. They continued their dominance in 2023, reaching the final once again, only to fall short in a thrilling clash against Chennai Super Kings.However, 2024 was a different story. With Pandya’s move to Mumbai Indians, the captaincy baton was passed to Shubman Gill, but the transition did not go as planned. Gujarat Titans endured a disappointing campaign, managing just 5 wins in 14 matches and finishing eighth, crashing out in the league stage.Now, with a revamped squad, Shubman and his team will be determined to turn things around in IPL 2025 .Ahead of the IPL 2025 Auction, Gujarat Titans retained their core, including Rashid Khan , Shubman Gill, B Sai Sudharsan, Rahul Tewatia, and Shahrukh Khan. They included England's batting star Jos Buttler (Rs 15.75 crore), Mohammed Siraj (Rs 12.25 crore), and Kagiso Rabada (Rs 10.75 crore) as their marquee signings in the IPL 2025 mega Auction.With a fresh squad and renewed ambitions, will Gujarat Titans erase the 2024 disappointments and reclaim the IPL trophy?Gujarat Titans will enter IPL 2025 with a formidable batting lineup. With a mix of proven batters and explosive all-rounders, the Shubman Gill-led side is expected to pile on the runs this season.At the top, Sai Sudharsan, Jos Buttler, Anuj Rawat, and Shubman Gill provide stability and firepower, ensuring solid starts for the team.The middle order is packed with big-hitters like Glenn Phillips, Shahrukh Khan, Rahul Tewatia, Mahipal Lomror, Sherfane Rutherford, Rashid Khan, and Washington Sundar, giving GT multiple match-winning options.Gujarat Titans also boast a well-rounded bowling unit, with both spin and pace arsenals covered.With depth in both batting and bowling, Gujarat Titans look well-equipped to make a strong statement in IPL 2025.Shubman Gill (C), Jos Buttler (wk), Sai Sudharsan, Glenn Phillips, Rahul Tewatia, Washington Sundar, Rashid Khan, Mohammed Siraj, Sai Kishore, Kagiso Rabada, Prasidh KrishnaShubman Gill (C), Jos Buttler, Sai Sudharsan, Shahrukh Khan, Kagiso Rabada, Mohammed Siraj, Prasidh Krishna, Rahul Tewatia, Rashid Khan, Nishant Sindhu, Mahipal Lomror, Kumar Kushagra, Anuj Rawat, Manav Suthar, Washington Sundar, Gerald Coetzee, Arshad Khan, Gurnoor Brar, Sherfane Rutherford, Sai Kishore, Ishant Sharma, Jayant Yadav, Glenn Phillips, Karim Janat, Kulwant Khejroliya.","Gujarat Titans made their IPL debut in 2022, winning the title in their very first season.

NEW DELHI: Indian cricketer Yuzvendra Chahal 's advocate, Nitin Kumar Gupta, addressed the media on Thursday, confirming that the court has granted the decree of divorce, officially ending the leg-spinner's marriage with Dhanashree Verma .""The court has granted the decree of divorce. The court has accepted the joint petition of both parties. The parties are no longer husband and wife,"" Gupta stated.Both Chahal and Dhanashree arrived separately at the court on Thursday, wearing masks to avoid being photographed.Dhanashree and Chahal got engaged in 2020 and tied the knot in December of the same year in a private ceremony in Gurugram.A day earlier, the Bombay High Court approved an application filed by the estranged couple seeking a waiver of the cooling-off period in their ongoing mutual consent divorce proceedings.Justice Madhav Jamdar of the Bombay HC directed the family court to decide on the divorce petition on Thursday itself, considering Chahal’s participation in the upcoming Indian Premier League (IPL).The leg-spinner was acquired by Punjab Kings (PBKS) for ?18 crore in the IPL 2025 auction.The Justice Jamdar-led Bench acknowledged that the couple had been living apart for over two and a half years and had fully complied with the consent terms regarding the payment of alimony, as agreed upon during mediation.Under Hindu law, if a husband and wife have been living separately for a year or more, they may file for a mutual consent divorce. However, Section 13B(2) of the Hindu Marriage Act mandates a statutory cooling-off period of at least six months from the date of filing to allow for the possibility of reconciliation.In a landmark 2017 ruling, the Supreme Court held that the six-month cooling-off period is not mandatory and may be waived if the court is satisfied that there is no chance of the couple resuming cohabitation.Dhanashree, 28, is a well-known dancer famous for her fusion performances that combine traditional Indian dance forms with contemporary styles.Recently, Chahal was spotted among the spectators at the Champions Trophy Final, sitting next to social media star RJ Mahvash.

NEW DELHI: Mumbai Indians , one of the most successful franchises in Indian Premier League (IPL) history, are set to make a strong comeback in the 2025 season after a forgettable campaign last year, where they finished at the bottom of the table under new captain Hardik Pandya. As five-time champions, the franchise will be determined to reclaim their glory with a revamped squad featuring a blend of experienced campaigners and exciting new additions.The franchise has retained its core lineup, including skipper Hardik Pandya, batting maestro Rohit Sharma, India's T20I captain Suryakumar Yadav, rising star Tilak Varma and pace sensation Jasprit Bumrah. These core players have been instrumental in Mumbai Indians' success over the years and will continue to be the backbone of the team. With the addition of new signings and renewed motivation, MI will aim to secure a record sixth IPL title.One of the most significant signings for the 2025 season is New Zealand's premier fast bowler Trent Boult. Known for his deadly swing and pace, Boult will bolster the pace attack alongside Deepak Chahar and English seamer Reece Topley. Boult's experience with Mumbai Indians in the past will be crucial in guiding the younger bowlers, and his ability to swing the new ball both ways will add a new dimension to the bowling lineup. These additions will complement Bumrah's fiery spells, forming a formidable pace battery that can trouble any batting lineup in the league.On the batting front, the acquisition of South African wicketkeeper-batter Ryan Rickelton brings fresh firepower at the top of the order. Known for his aggressive stroke play and consistency, Rickelton will be pivotal in providing quick starts. Alongside him, former captain Rohit Sharma and Suryakumar Yadav will continue to be the bedrock of Mumbai's batting unit.

Virat Kohli set to return as RCB captain from the 2025 edition of the IPL

Royal Challengers Bengaluru Auction Review: RCB had an excellent auction and have covered most bases

RCB SWOT Analysis

Strengths

A more balanced squad compared to previous seasons, with depth in both batting and bowling

Power-packed middle and lower order featuring Liam Livingstone, Tim David, Romario Shepherd, and Jitesh Sharma

Improved bowling resources with the addition of experienced pacers like Josh Hazlewood and Bhuvneshwar Kumar

A more pragmatic approach at the auction focusing on roles over star power

Homegrown talent in Patidar leading the side could bring a fresh, fearless leadership style

Weaknesses

Historical struggles at the M Chinnaswamy Stadium, where high-scoring matches and spin woes persist.

New leadership under Patidar could face pressure, given the team's passionate fanbase and scrutiny over captaincy

Over-reliance on Virat Kohli at the top and the unproven nature of the Phil Salt-Kohli opening pair.

Injury clouds over key players like Hazlewood and Bethell may disrupt early momentum.

Opportunities

Emerging talents like Rasikh Salam and Jacob Bethell can break out and fill important roles.

The new squad composition gives RCB a chance to improve their poor home record.

Patidar has the opportunity to establish himself as a long-term leader.

Threats

High-pressure games at home could lead to familiar collapses if spin issues remain unresolved.

Stiff competition in the mid-table battle from teams like CSK, RR, and LSG.

Injuries to key players like Hazlewood or Livingstone could stretch the squad’s resources

RCB Expected Playing XI

RCB squad for IPL 2025

NEW DELHI: Royal Challengers Bengaluru enter Indian Premier League (IPL) 2025 with renewed hope after last season’s dramatic turnaround, where they clawed back from winning just one in eight matches at the start to make the playoffs, only to be stopped in the Eliminator. The upcoming edition marks a new era with Rajat Patidar as captain, reflecting a shift towards trusting local talent over big overseas names.They've added depth and balance to their squad. Reliable bowlers like Josh Hazlewood and Bhuvneshwar Kumar aim to solve their long-standing bowling woes at the M Chinnaswamy Stadium . Multi-skilled players like Liam Livingstone, Jacob Bethell, and Krunal Pandya give them tactical flexibility.The challenge will be for newly installer skipper Patidar who will have to marshal a squad blending experienced internationals and hungry domestic players. A key storyline is whether Phil Salt can complement Virat Kohli at the top and if Devdutt Padikkal can reignite his career.RCB’s middle-order, once overly reliant on individual brilliance, now has layers with the likes of Tim David and Romario Shepherd adding explosiveness. The squad also reflects a more analytical approach to squad-building under Mo Bobat and Andy Flower, focusing on match-ups and roles rather than marquee signings alone.The bowling attack — historically a weak link at home — will be tested. Hazlewood’s fitness and Rasikh Salam’s emergence as a breakout candidate will be critical.With an improved support staff, a new-look squad, and key players needing to prove themselves, RCB’s hunt for that elusive first title enters yet another compelling chapter.Virat Kohli, Phil Salt, Rajat Patidar (c), Liam Livingstone, Krunal Pandya, Jitesh Sharma (wk), Tim David, Rasikh Dar, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Josh Hazlewood, Yash DayalRajat Patidar (c), Virat Kohli, Yash Dayal, Josh Hazlewood, Phil Salt, Jitesh Sharma, Liam Livingstone, Rasikh Dar, Suyash Sharma, Krunal Pandya, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Swapnil Singh, Tim David, Romario Shepherd, Nuwan Thushara, Manoj Bhandage, Jacob Bethel, Devdutt Padikkal, Swastik Chhikara, Lungi Ngidi, Abhinandan Singh, Mohit Rathee.","Royal Challengers Bengaluru enter Indian Premier League (IPL) 2025 with renewed hope after last season’s dramatic turnaround.

MUMBAI: In a bid to get decision-making as close to 100% as possible in IPL (Indian Premier League) 2025, the BCCI (Board of Control for Cricket in India) has introduced an innovative method to judge short deliveries for no balls and wides .At present, the fast bowlers are allowed two bouncers in an over in the IPL. The third is adjudged to be a no ball . Any ball above the batter's head is deemed to be a wide.Building on its innovative approach in IPL 2024 to judge waist-high full tosses -- often a point of contention -- by measuring each player's waist height using a measuring tape, the BCCI has now extended the process to include measurements up to the shoulder and head as well""The measurement of the waist, shoulder and head height will be applied when the batter is standing upright in his popping crease.

PANAJI: Hamza Choudhury ’s arrival in Bangladesh earlier this week, sparked a never-before frenzy for a footballer in south Asia. The midfielder’s car was mobbed by supporters, everyone wanted a piece of him, a touch, a selfie, good enough even if he caught the eye. And there was so much Hamza had to do, including, among other things, a meeting with the adviser for Youth and Sports to the Interim Government.All this, before the team left for India for the opening group clash of the Asian Cup 2027 final round qualifiers on Thursday.Hamza, 27, you could say, is no ordinary footballer. No Lionel Messi, but with 57 Premier League appearances for Leicester City until Januay this year, he’s the highest profile footballer to represent a south Asian country in internationals.Until his loan move to Championship side Sheffield United in January, the Foxes academy graduate was the only British Asian playing in the Premier League in over two decades. Zesh Rehman, of Pakistani origin, was the first British Asian to start a Premier League match, turning out for Fulham in 2003.The Birmingham-born Rehman chose to represent hosts Pakistan at the 2005 SAFF Championship — a tournament where incidentally, a 20-year-old striker called Sunil Chhetri made his international debut for India.Rehman went on to make 22 appearances for the Pakistan national team, even captaining the side. On Thursday it was a similar feeling towards the east of the region.“It feels like our Messi is here,” Bangladesh captain Jamal Bhuyan told reporters during the team’s official media briefing prior to Thursday’s departure. “The excitement is five times greater than when I first arrived. Hamza is a Premier League player, it’s a huge boost for us,” added Bhuyan.Bhuyan’s own story is equally fascinating. After showing promise as a junior in Denmark, he was on the verge of breaking into the senior team when he was caught in the crossfire of gang-related gunfire in the Danish capital, a bullet hitting his head and putting him into coma.His career slowed down, and in 2013, he eventually returned to Bangladesh. Five years later, he rose to become captain. Hamza is even more special. Born to a Grenadian father and a Bangladeshi mother, Hamza made seven appearances for England Under-21s and chose to represent Bangladesh in senior international football , thanks to his ancestry. The defensive midfielder is expected to make his international debut against India in Shillong on Tuesday.India go into the fixture on the back of a 3-0 friendly win against the Maldives on Wednesday. There were two goals from set-pieces; Rahul Bheke scored in his second successive game, Liston Colaco scored his first in India colours, but more importantly, Sunil Chhetri, coaxed out of retirement at 40 by coach Manolo Marquez, showed just why he can still be counted to deliver.For Bangladesh, who would have been watching closely, it’s Hamza who they are counting upon.“You can’t compare Sunil Chhetri to Hamza. Sunil has done great things for India, but let’s be honest, Hamza is a Premier League player,” said Bhuyan, the poster boy of Bangladesh football, until Hamza’s arrival.At 185th, Bangladesh is the lowest-ranked team in the Asian Cup 2027 qualifiers group, which also has Hong Kong and Singapore. But Hamza’s inclusion has raised hopes of qualification to the continental showpiece for the first time.“One player cannot fully change one team, but it’s true that Hamza’s inclusion has raised expectations around the national team,” former Bangladesh national team coach Oscar Bruzon told TOI.Now with East Bengal, Bruzon spoke of the edge Hamza’s presence adds.“When you have a player from the Premier League, the standards rise and the players around you are motivated to do their best. The advantage for Bangladesh is more psychological,” he said.Bruzon is no stranger to football in Bangladesh. In the five years that he spent there, he won the Bangladesh Premier League four times with Basundhara Kings and, in addition to his club duties, took charge of the national team.“Bangladesh has strong players (physically), but they are missing a little bit of creativity in the middle. Hamza can play centre-back or defensive midfield, but I think they will try and bring him forward (more). There will be changes in some patterns of play. He is definitely of a different level, so everyone will have to adapt and adjust on the pitch.“Hamza will be very motivated,” pointed out Bruzon. “The craze is un - believable. I don’t think adaptation will be difficult because Bangladesh already has some technically good players. Tariq Kazi (Finland), for example, is young and talented defender. They are looking for others too playing in higher leagues.”","Hamza Choudhury is the highest profile footballer to represent a south Asian country in internationals.

SHILLONG: Despite the first win in 2025, and one after 489 days, all is not well in the Indian camp.Late on Wednesday, Manolo Marquez was a worried man even after securing his first win after becoming India coach in July. Unable to pick the injured Lallianzuala Chhangte and Asish Rai for this FIFA window, Marquez will now miss winger Manvir Singh and midfielder Brandon Fernandes for the crucial AFC Asian Cup qualifier against Bangladesh here on Tuesday.While Manvir — in fine form for 2024-25 ISL Shield Winners Mohun Bagan Super Giant — was released from the squad ahead of the Maldives friendly that India won 3-0, Marquez said Brandon, too, is certain to miss the Bangladesh tie.“Brandon won’t be available, for sure. It’s really bad luck that we lost three players — in the last game of the ISL, Manvir on Tuesday during the break session and today Brandon,” he said after the game on Wednesday.One of the more influential players against Maldives till he was stretchered off from the ground in the 39th minute, Brandon also delivered the corner for Rahul Bheke’s opening goal on Wednesday.The Mumbai City attacking midfielder went down to the ground in great pain at the half-hour mark, before being able to carry on for only another 10 minutes. Marquez did not want to take any risk, and had Brandon substituted with Chennaiyin FC striker-winger Farukh Choudhary.The player was later seen with a heavily strapped knee.Brandon’s unavailability forces the coach now on finding an able replacement ahead of Tuesday’s competitive clash.“We will call someone. We will recover Brison, who was in the stands, but let’s see which player,” he said.Brison Fernandes, who had a fine season at FC Goa under Marquez himself, missed the Maldives tie with a minor injury. Marquez did not want to risk aggravating the niggle, but with Brandon out, he could step in after regaining match fitness in in the interim week.A contender for the ISL Emerging Player Award, the 23-year-old midfielder has seven goals and two assists in 22 appearances this season. With passing accuracy and a fine possession game, Brison has the ingredients to graduate into an asset under Marquez.Aiming for their third consecutive appearance in the Asian meet, India are clubbed with Hong Kong China, Singapore and Bangladesh in Group C of the qualifiers.

- 'Not to mock him' -

COPENHAGEN: Rasmus Hojlund earned Denmark a deserved 1-0 lead over Portugal in their Nations League quarter-final first leg clash on Thursday. The Manchester United forward delivered from the bench to split the teams in Copenhagen, providing the finishing touch Denmark previously lacked on a night where they dominated Roberto Martinez's side.The Spanish coach selected veteran Cristiano Ronaldo , 40, up front but the Al-Nassr striker was mostly frozen out of the game.Winners of the inaugural tournament in 2019, Portugal are aiming to become the first team to lift the Nations League trophy for a second time.However they will need to improve swiftly to reach the semi-finals as Denmark outclassed them and could have scored more on the night, with Christian Eriksen missing a penalty.""It was our worst performance in the last two years,"" Portugal coach Martinez admitted, speaking to RTP.""After a five-month break, we clearly didn't come out with the intensity we needed. Denmark's pressure was very effective.""We lacked a lot. We lacked intensity... the level of our performance is not at the level we expected.""Looking for their first win under coach Brian Riemer, who was appointed in October, the Danes were without injured captain Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg.Denmark piled on the pressure from the start, with debutant Mika Biereth charging down Diogo Costa's clearance, but the goalkeeper managed to escape with conceding only a corner.Jesper Lindstrom forced Costa into action again with an effort from distance, while Pedro Neto tested Kasper Schmeichel at the other end.The hosts won a penalty when Portugal defender Renato Veiga handled the ball but Costa produced a superb save to deny Eriksen.The Porto goalkeeper, an expert in saving spot kicks, dived low to his right to thwart the Manchester United midfielder.Costa made another stunning save from Biereth to keep his team level, as Denmark turned the screw.When the hosts finally beat Costa, Diogo Dalot was in the right place at the right time to clear Eriksen's effort off the line just before the break, after good work by Gustav Isaksen.Riemer's side stayed on top in the second half, with Costa saving an Eriksen free-kick, although Vitinha came close for Portugal, who showed occasional flashes of their quality on an otherwise lethargic display.Isaksen, a constant menace, had a shot deflected behind as Denmark started to fear their dominance would not translate into a lead. However Hojlund, on as a substitute, had other ideas.The striker, who ended a long Manchester United drought last weekend by scoring in his team's win at Leicester City, broke the deadlock by slotting home to cap a fine move.Eriksen spread the ball to another substitute, Andreas Skov Olsen, who picked out Hojlund with a low ball to finish coolly in the 78th minute.The forward imitated Ronaldo's jumping ""Siuuu"" celebration but said it was a tribute to the former Man United and Real Madrid superstar.""I'm playing against the world's best footballer, my idol, and to score and become the (match) winner, it couldn't be better,"" Hojlund told Denmark's TV2.""It was not to mock him or anything, I've always said he has had great importance for me and my football career.""Portugal's Bernardo Silva, making his 99th appearance for his country, had a penalty appeal late on waved away after falling under pressure from Patrick Dorgu in the box, and Schmeichel saved from Neto in the final stages.Portugal host Denmark in the second leg in Lisbon on Sunday.""Pressure is part of football, now it increases because we're one goal down, but we have time to correct that,"" Costa told RTP.""Everything is still up for grabs and we have to focus on that to give a reaction (to this defeat).""",Denmark beat Portugal 1-0 in their Nations League quarter-final first leg clash. Rasmus Hojlund scores the only goal of the game in the 78th minute. Portugal host Denmark in the second leg in Lisbon on Sunday.

SHILLONG: Sunil Chhetri justified being coaxed out of his international retirement by a beleaguered India coach Manolo Marquez with a performance on his return to the national fold, which seemed like he had never left at all. That, and a fine glancing header for his 95th career goal helped give India its first international win in over a year — after 489 days — a 3-0 scoreline against Maldives here on Wednesday.Chhetri who started the game and stayed in the thick of things till he was substituted in the 82nd minute, helped himself to a goal in the 76th. Before that, Rahul Bheke (34) and Liston Colaco (66) had done enough to put the issue beyond Maldives’s reach.Marquez got his first win as India head coach and India got their first victory after over a year. They were winless in their last five international games with two of those being losses.For the first half hour, however, both sides looked to be playing a friendly game without fire as the play lacked any quality moves at both ends of the pitch. Once Bheke scored the opener with a header from Brandon Fernandes corner from left, the complexion of the match changed for the better for the home side.Despite the pre-game craze, the official attendance for India’s first ever international game in Shillong was a modest 6,798. On the lukewarm response, the Meghalaya Football Association (MFA) said it being a weekday as well as a friendly could be they reason for low turnout.They were optimistic it would be a full house when Bangladesh come calling Tuesday. Still, there was enough support for Chhetri, the crowd screaming his name, and he didn’t disappoint.The first half ended with India keeping their nose ahead with the sole lead. Five minutes after the change of ends, India found themselves with a brilliant chance to double their lead, only to be denied off the goalline by the Maldives defence.In the 66th minute, Maldives goalkeeper Hussain Shareef forced an excellent save with his leg, but the resultant corner produced the goal India were looking for. This time Naorem Mahesh Singh curled his corner from left towards the second post where an unmarked Colaco rose to the occasion to double the advantage and broke into a Cristiano Ronaldo-like celebration near the corner flag.But the stand erupted in joy only when Chhetri brought in his 95th strike towards the end on his international return as he flicked a header following Colaco’s assist.Maldives barely entered the Indian territory throughout the match.",India beat Maldives 3-0 in their first international game in over a year.

NEW DELHI: Sunil Chhetri made a remarkable comeback to the national team after retiring from international football in May last year. In a friendly match against Maldives on Wednesday, Chhetri's presence proved to be the catalyst for India's commanding 3-0 victory, helping the team snap their 12-match winless streak that had persisted since November 2023.The match unfolded with Rahul Bheke giving India the lead in the 35th minute, followed by Liston Colaco extending the advantage to 2-0 in the 66th minute.The 40-year-old Chhetri, who had returned to the national team, etched his name in the scoresheet with a glancing header in the 77th minute, marking his 95th international goal .Chhetri's impact was evident as he narrowly missed a scoring opportunity in the 47th minute, denied by the Maldives goalkeeper. He was eventually substituted in the 82nd minute, having made a memorable contribution to the team's victory.This triumph held significance as it marked India's first win in 16 months and the first under the guidance of Manolo Marquez , who was appointed as the head coach in July last year. India's previous victory came against Kuwait (1-0) in their 2026 FIFA World Cup qualifying round match in Kuwait City on November 16, 2023.The friendly match served as a dress rehearsal for India's crucial AFC Asian Cup qualifier against Bangladesh, scheduled for March 25 at the same venue. Chhetri's return to the national team was specifically aimed at aiding the team's successful navigation through the qualifiers.With Maldives ranked 162nd in the world, 36 places below India (126th), the match provided an opportunity for the Indian team to regain their winning momentum and prepare for the upcoming challenges in the AFC Asian Cup qualifiers .",India beat Maldives 3-0 in a friendly match on Wednesday.

SHILLONG: India’s friendly international against Maldives here has gathered more firsts than it promised. When the schedule for India’s matches in this FIFA international window was announced, Wednesday’s friendly was marked as the first time that the senior national team will play in Meghalaya’s capital, ahead of their more important 2027 AFC Asian Cup Qualifier against Bangladesh next week.More than the match being the first of its kind in Shillong, however, is Sunil Chhetri ’s comeback in national colours. As the 40-year-old is ready to play his 152th international game, after being coaxed out of retirement by the India head coach Manolo Marquez earlier this month, all focus and talk around the game has been around Chhetri.On Tuesday, Marquez confirmed that India’s all-time leading scorer, who has been training with the team here since Saturday, will have a part to play against Maldives.“For sure, he will play some minutes. I don’t know whether as a starter or from the bench. We can use six substitutions, so 17 players can play, Sunil will be one of them,” said Marquez. “Sunil is the Indian player with the most goals this season. It doesn’t matter if a player is 20, 40, or my grandfather at 87. If they are in better shape, they will be here,” the Spaniard asserted.“The national team is not about developing players. Developed players have to arrive here. The main team needs to win games. And if we need to win games, we need to call players who are in better shape.”With his first competitive game since becoming India coach in July last year just a week away, Marquez is banking on the Maldives friendly as an opportunity to take stock and assess his combination before the March 25 Asian Cup qualifier.“It’s a friendly game to prepare for the Asian Cup qualifier. We knew that the target during the previous FIFA windows was to arrive in the best possible condition against Bangladesh next Tuesday. I don’t think we will play with the same team against Bangladesh that will play tomorrow. Obviously, you can’t change all 11. Some will repeat. It has to be a good game and a good preparation for Bangladesh,” said the coach.Maldives, who had reportedly requested to shift this match out of Shillong due to logistical issues earlier, will be using the friendly to prepare for their Asian Cup qualifier against Philippines next Tuesday.",India face Maldives in a friendly international in Shillong on Wednesday.

Miami:

Australian Nick Kyrgios won his first match since 2022 as he fought back from a set down to beat American Mackenzie McDonald 3-6, 6-3, 6-4 at the Miami Open on Wednesday.Kyrgios's career has been blighted by injuries in the last two years and he had to retire from his first round match at Indian Wells earlier this month.The flamboyant 29-year-old had suffered pain in his surgically reconstructed right wrist - a procedure that left him on the sidelines for 18 months.""It has been a long journey, even to just get to the start line of matches and be scared to just finish them,"" Kyrgios said.""To come off and get a win and feel like I belong again was special,"" added after the one-hour, 43-minute victory.Kyrgios, the 2022 Wimbledon finalist, has been plagued by injuries in his career but it was the wrist which caused him the most serious issues and he said he was deeply pessimistic about his chances of a comeback.""I never thought I would play tennis again to be brutally honest with you. I was having conversations with my camp and my team, and I said 'I don't know how long I can keep doing this for',"" he said.""This (win) puts some petrol in the tank but I need to be realistic and see how my wrist feels tomorrow because it is a grind out here,"" he added.There was a first round win for 38-year-old Frenchman Gael Monfils who became the second oldest man, after Jimmy Connors, to win at the Miami Open.Monfils beat last year's quarter-finalist, Hungary's Fabian Marozsan, 6-3, 3-6, 6-4.In the women's draw, Emma Raducanu claimed her first win, defeating 19-year-old wild card Sayaka Ishii of Japan 6-2, 6-1 in just 65 minutes.The 2021 US Open champion will face eighth-seeded American Emma Navarro in the second round, her first meeting with a top 10 player since losing to Iga Swiatek in the Australian Open third round.""It's going to be an extremely challenging match,"" Raducanu said in her on-court interview.

I felt like I was in control. I knew what I needed to do. I just went for it and played to win.""In his first Masters 1000 final, Draper established control early, taking a 4-0 lead. He lost only four points on serve in the opening set, while Rune committed 10 of his 19 unforced errors.Rune, who had previously won the Paris Masters in 2022, managed to hold serve twice before losing the first set. The set concluded with Draper's ace, followed by Rune's backhand error.""I think today was very clear that I didn't play well enough. He was serving amazing, for sure. But I think I could have done my part better. Jack was playing extremely well, but the few chances I had to make it difficult for him, I didn't quite take them, because I wasn't really trusting every shot of my game today.""The second set began with Draper breaking Rune's serve.

After a forehand error on his first match point, he claimed victory when Rune hit a long backhand.Draper's run to a third career title included victories not only over Alcaraz but also over 2022 Indian Wells winner Taylor Fritz and big-hitting home hope Ben Shelton.""Last year I lost here and I felt so uncomfortable playing here,"" Draper said. ""My serve was really struggling. I didn't feel like I was in control of the ball, and I lost my way mentally last year.""So I knew coming here this year is a challenge, but not only for me but for a lot of the players. I think Taylor and Carlos play in a way where they are very aggressive with their forehand, they serve great.""As the matches went on, I felt more and more confident in these conditions.""Draper, who claimed his two prior ATP titles in 2024, said his biggest title to date was a testament to his perseverance.""I feel like I deserve it, in all honesty,"" he said.

Carlos came out a little flat, I sensed that. I had a chance in the first game of the second, and he came up with an ace... What happened to him happened to me, I got tight, I had low energy.

BENGALURU: The first two months of the 2025 tennis season has been all uphill for Sumit Nagal , starting in Melbourne in January and then on clay in Rosario and Buenos Aires, laid low by a flu.The 27-year-old will make a return to tournament play in the ATP Challenger in Murcia next week after staying away from the Tour for about a month.Nagal, whose ranking is down to 132, was thrown a curveball by what he suspects was a bout of Covid-19 in January. The Indian, who chose the rigour of the South American swing over the four-week ATP Challenger series in India in February, was caught unawares in Argentina.“If I knew I was (so) unwell I would never have gone to South America,” Nagal told TOI during a telephone interview. “You’re going so far away, not feeling your best, that makes no sense.”Nagal, who has spent the last few weeks at his training base in Germany, is gradually working his way back.“I never really felt good since Australia, it was maybe Covid-19 over there, I wasn’t sure,” the India No.1 said. “When I was in Argentina I was practicing a bit and then I wasn’t really practicing. It wasn’t a great few weeks for me. I was struggling so much with my health, I was fatigued, I was barely practicing. And when I practiced or played I would feel super tired.”“It has been good in the last two weeks. I have been practicing quite a bit, pushing a bit,” said Nagal, who marked his fitness at eight on a scale of 1 to 10.Nagal, who climbed to a career-high No.68 in the ranking last July, is now chasing a main draw berth at Roland Garros. He’s scheduled to play two ATP Challengers, followed by Monte Carlo Masters 1000, where he went through qualifiers last year to make the round of 32, after which the Indian will look at 250 Series tournaments.While there are nine Indians in the top-150 of the doubles rankings, Nagal is the only Indian in the top-250 of the singles rankings on the men’s and women’s tours.","Sumit Nagal will make a return to tournament play in the ATP Challenger in Murcia next week.

Sabalenka trounces Keys in Australian Open re-match

Russian teenager Mirra Andreeva ended the defending champion Iga Swiatek 's quest for a historic third Indian Wells title, defeating the world number two 7-6 (1), 1-6, 6-3 on Friday to advance to the final.At just 17, Andreeva snapped Swiatek's 10-match winning streak at Indian Wells, marking her second victory over the Polish star in three weeks—having previously triumphed in Dubai's quarter-finals en route to becoming the youngest WTA 1000 champion ever.On Sunday, Andreeva will face Aryna Sabalenka , who dominated Australian Open champion Madison Keys . The American veteran Keys had denied Sabalenka a third consecutive title in Melbourne, where she claimed her first major in January.Andreeva is the youngest finalist at Indian Wells since Kim Clijsters, who was 17 in 2001.In the match against Swiatek, Andreeva showcased her skills in the first set tiebreaker and managed to regroup after a challenging second set.Although Swiatek started confidently, dropping only one point in her first three service games, Andreeva seized a 5-4 lead with a crucial break, benefiting from a double fault by Swiatek. The match proceeded to a tiebreaker where Andreeva dominated.""I felt like I'm gonna go and play the tiebreak like it's the last tiebreak of my life,"" she said. ""So I just went for all my shots. My serve was great. I just felt super comfortable and confident,"" she said.""I saw my mom's nervous face in the big screen,"" Andreeva told the crowd. ""I tried not to look there.""Despite Swiatek rebounding in the second set with three breaks, the momentum shifted back to Andreeva in the third. She ultimately secured victory with her third break of the set.""I just decided to kind of still play the same but maybe go for my shots more, trying to play a little bit more aggressive,"" she said.""I feel also that I was dealing with the nerves and the pressure pretty good, so I just feel proud of myself.""World number one Aryna Sabalenka dispatched Madison Keys 6-0, 6-1 to reach the Indian Wells final, avenging her loss to the fifth-ranked American in the Australian Open final.In just 51 minutes, Sabalenka set up a title match against Andreeva.The Belarusian, seeking revenge after her January defeat to Keys, was sharp from the start, completing the first set in just 23 minutes.""I was hungry,"" said Sabalenka, who had made no bones about wanting revenge. ""That Australian Open match was really heartbroken for me, and I really needed some time to recover after that.""And if I would lose today again, it would get in my head and I didn't want that to happen. I was really focused -- I was just really hungry to get this win against Madison.""Keys, who had a 16-match winning streak culminating in her Australian Open victory, struggled to make an impact.""I think tactically I played really great tennis,"" said Sabalenka, adding her strategy was to ""just keep her out of the rhythm"".Despite overcoming the cold, swirling winds on Stadium Court and winning the first 11 games, Sabalenka's dominance was clear. Keys managed to hold serve for the first time at 5-1 in the second set, but Sabalenka quickly closed out the match.This marks Sabalenka's second appearance in the Indian Wells final; she was the runner-up to Elena Rybakina in 2023.","Russian teenager Mirra Andreeva beat defending champion Iga Swiatek 7-6 (1), 1-6, 6-3.

Madison Keys powered into the Indian Wells semifinals on Thursday, dismantling wild-card Belinda Bencic 6-1, 6-1 in just 65 minutes to notch her 16th straight victory. The fifth-seeded American, who claimed the Australian Open title earlier this year, now sets up a highly anticipated rematch with world No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka . The two last met at Melbourne Park in January, where Keys defeated Sabalenka in a three-set battle, halting the Belarusian’s bid for a third straight title.Despite upsetting No. 4 seed Coco Gauff in the previous round, Bencic — a 28-year-old from Switzerland — had no answers for Keys’ relentless play.Elsewhere in the women’s draw, defending champion Iga Swiatek continued her dominant run in the California desert, advancing to her fourth straight semifinal at Indian Wells with a 6-3, 6-3 win over eighth-seeded Qinwen Zheng. Swiatek, the No. 2 seed and a five-time Grand Slam winner, is aiming to become the first woman to win the event three times. She’s riding a 10-match win streak at Indian Wells, having also lifted the trophy in 2022.Zheng, who had ended Swiatek’s 25-match winning streak at the Paris Olympics last year, couldn’t replicate that magic. Though she broke Swiatek twice and won six games — equaling the total games Swiatek had lost all tournament — the Polish star converted all five of her break points to seal the match.In the men’s draw, two-time defending champion Carlos Alcaraz fought off determined challenger Francisco Cerundolo 6-3, 7-6 (7/4) to reach the semi-finals.On another cold, blustery night in the California desert, Alcaraz battled back from 1-4 down in the second set, coming up with a break and two love service holds to force the tiebreaker as he kept his bid to join Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic as the only men to win three straight Indian Wells titles on track.Alcaraz had to save break points in each of his first three service games. But after an emphatic hold for 4-3 he gained the first break of the contest with a deft volley and just like that he was serving for the first set.After sliding to pop a drop volley winner over the net for set point Alcaraz drilled a deep forehand that Cerundolo could barely get a racquet on.But it was Cerundolo who broke first in the second, finally converting his ninth break point of the match then holding for 4-1.But he couldn't hold off the world number three, who raced to a 5-2 lead in the tiebreaker on the way to victory.""It was really difficult for me to start the match,"" said Alcaraz, who looked less comfortable in the windy weather than he did just a day before.""He got a lot of chances in the first set,"" Alcaraz said. ""I'm just pleased about saving all of them and taking the only one that I had.""I didn't hit the ball as clear as yesterday, but I just did what I had to and that's what it's about.""Alcaraz next faces Britain's Jack Draper, who reached his first Masters 1000 semi-final with a 6-4, 7-5 victory over American Ben Shelton.Draper took the opening set with one break of serve then rallied from 0-3 down in a second-set slug-fest.Shelton's 32 unforced errors included five double-faults -- including one to hand Draper a break for 6-5 in the second.Russian Daniil Medvedev , runner-up to Alcaraz each of the past two years, rallied from a break down in a wild, wind-blown final set to beat Arthur Fils 6-4, 2-6, 7-6 (9/7).The world number six booked a semi-final meeting with Denmark's Holger Rune , a 5-7, 6-0, 6-3 winner over Tallon Griekspoor.Medvedev, a six-time Grand Slam finalist, trailed 20-year-old Fils 2-4 in the third set of a compelling clash that was momentarily paused as gusting winds sent towels and trash cans flying on Stadium Court.France's Fils had shown admirable maturity in the face of Medvedev's formidable defensive skills.He cut down on the unforced errors that marred his first set to win the second with ease and maintained his poise as he erased an early break in the third to seize the lead.But Medvedev wouldn't be denied and after forcing the tiebreaker prevailed on his third match point when Fils pushed a backhand volley long.Medvedev, who had won just one of his past nine third-set tiebreakers, gave a leap of sheer joy after securing the win in 2 hours and 25 minutes to keep alive his bid for a first title since 2023 -- when he won five.""I lost a lot of tight matches this year where I could have won, should have won maybe,"" Medvedev said. ""I have lost a lot of tight matches where it goes a little bit 50-50 and the more it goes like that, the more you can lose confidence in the tight moments.""I was happy I was able to get over the line as he saved some match points and had a break lead in the third. I am just happy to win.""Medvedev faces another young gun in Rune, who burst onto the scene in 2022 with a win over Novak Djokovic in the Paris Masters final.Rune has struggled often since, but after dropping the first set he dominated Griekspoor, the 43rd-ranked Dutchman who had ousted top-seeded Alexander Zverev in the second round.","Madison Keys crushes wild-card Belinda Bencic 6-1,6-1 in just 65 minutes to notch her 16th straight victory.

NEW DELHI: Mirra Andreeva ’s stunning rise in the WTA rankings has been so rapid that even the 17-year-old Russian admits she can’t quite keep up with it. Just last month in Dubai, she made history as the youngest-ever WTA 1000 champion , defeating both Grand Slam winners Iga Swiatek and Elena Rybakina on her way to the title — a win that catapulted her into the top 10 for the first time, landing at No. 9.Now at Indian Wells , Andreeva entered the tournament ranked 11th, but wins over Rybakina once again in the fourth round and Elina Svitolina in the quarter-finals are expected to lift her back into the top 10. Not that she’s been checking too closely.""Before, I was always checking live rankings because before I was playing for a dog,"" Andreeva said with a smile. ""So after every match I play I would check the live rankings to see if I did it.""That milestone — breaking into the top 20 — came after she defeated Magda Linette in Beijing last October. The reward? A promise of a dog. But even now, the pet hasn’t arrived yet, as she’s still narrowing down her choice.""I'm thinking to get an ultra mini labradoodle ,"" she revealed. ""It's going to be a labrador mixed with poodle and it's ultra min, so going to be even smaller than a mini version. It's going to take time until the dog that I want will be born.""While rankings may not be her primary focus anymore, Andreeva is channeling her energy into what’s right in front of her — like an upcoming semi-final clash at Indian Wells against defending champion Swiatek. Despite her recent win over the Pole in Dubai, she’s not expecting it to give her any advantage.""It doesn't give me any benefit to our match (on Friday),"" she admitted.Tennis has become increasingly serious for the teenager, but she's not letting that take the fun out of the game completely. The young star, who draws inspiration from athletes like Roger Federer and LeBron James, is trying to balance focus with enjoyment.""When I was a bit younger it would all be about having fun,"" Andreeva said. ""But now I start to understand that it's pretty serious what I do out here. I feel like when I have fun on the court I play great tennis, so I still try to not be super, super serious but also to have fun a little bit.""So while a top-10 return and a potential title shot are on the horizon, Andreeva remains grounded — eyes on the next match, and perhaps more importantly, on the tiny dog she’s patiently waiting for.","Mirra Andreeva's rise in the WTA rankings has been so rapid that even the 17-year-old Russian admits she can’t keep up with it.

The Bulgarian had previously won their last two encounters, including the quarter-finals at the Miami Open last year.With his 50th ATP Masters 1000 match win, Alcaraz kept his hopes alive of joining Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic as the only men to win three consecutive Indian Wells titles.Having reached the fourth round without dropping a set, Alcaraz produced his most impressive performance of the tournament. Despite the swirling winds that caused ball kids to scramble after blowing trash, Alcaraz appeared supremely untroubled.He broke Dimitrov's serve to open the match and secured the first set with another break. Alcaraz didn't face a break point until the fifth game of the second set, but he overcame that challenge with an ace on Dimitrov's third break chance. Alcaraz then broke the Bulgarian's serve to take a 5-1 lead.Alcaraz sealed the victory in style, earning a match point with his sixth ace of the match and clinching the win with a forehand winner.

NEW DELHI: Belinda Bencic produced a stunning comeback to upset world number three Coco Gauff on Wednesday, booking her place in the Indian Wells quarter-finals where she will face Australian Open champion Madison Keys .The Swiss star, who gave birth to her daughter Bella last April, triumphed 3-6, 6-3, 6-4 to reach her first WTA 1000 quarter-final since becoming a mother. Unranked when she returned to the tour in October, Bencic has steadily climbed back, capturing her ninth career title in Abu Dhabi last month and rising to 58th in the world this week.“I just kept on working also on the physical side,” Bencic said. “In the last matches in tournaments, I was able to play back-to-back, some three-set matches, and am fresher every time.

Defending champions and co-hosts India walk into the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup 2026 as overwhelming favourites, beginning their title defence against the United States at the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai on Saturday. The World No.1 side arrives with an aura of invincibility — a team that has transitioned smoothly after a generational shift and now looks sharper, faster and more aggressive than ever.The triumph in the 2024 edition marked the end of an era, with head coach Rahul Dravid stepping away and stalwarts Virat Kohli, Rohit Sharma and Ravindra Jadeja retiring from the format. Yet, rather than weakening India, the change sparked a reinvention. The new-look side under Suryakumar Yadav has embraced a high-octane philosophy, built around fearless batting and attacking spin, turning them into one of the most formidable T20 outfits in recent memory.The numbers underline their dominance. Since lifting the trophy on June 29, 2024, India have won 33 of their 41 T20Is, losing just six. They sit comfortably atop the ICC rankings, with Abhishek Sharma and Varun Chakaravarthy currently holding the No.1 batter and bowler spots respectively. As they chase a third T20 World Cup crown — and a second in succession — India’s squad enters the tournament with confidence and only a few lingering concerns.When the 15-member squad was announced, the biggest talking point was the form of captain Suryakumar Yadav. The dynamic batter endured a forgettable 2025, scoring just 218 runs in 21 T20Is at an average of 13.62 and a strike rate of 123.16, without a single fifty. Despite the scrutiny, he maintained that he was “out of runs, not out of form,” and continued to lead a team that kept winning.Relief arrived during the home series against New Zealand — India’s final rehearsal before the World Cup. Surya roared back with 242 runs in five innings at an average of 80.66 and a blistering strike rate of 196.74, including three half-centuries. The resurgence not only restored belief in the dressing room but also added stability at the top of the order.India’s new batting spearhead, Abhishek Sharma, has been nothing short of sensational since debuting in mid-2024. The current No.1 ranked T20I batter has redefined India’s approach at the top with his ultra-aggressive style.He smashed 182 runs against New Zealand this year at a staggering strike rate of 249.31, while his 2025 season saw him amass 859 runs at an average of 42.95 and a strike rate nearing 200. With a century and five fifties last year, Abhishek’s fearless starts have become central to India’s strategy — setting the tone for the middle order to capitalise.Fitness concerns briefly clouded Tilak Varma’s place after he missed the New Zealand series, but the left-hander remains a vital cog at No.3. With a career T20I average close to 50 and a strike rate above 144, Tilak has evolved into one of India’s most reliable anchors in a high-tempo lineup.His 567 runs from 18 innings last year at 47.25 underline his consistency. Returning from injury, scores of 38 and 45 in World Cup warm-ups against USA and South Africa hinted that he is match-ready — a reassuring sign for India’s batting depth.If there is one selection dilemma, it revolves around Sanju Samson. Once a regular opening partner for Abhishek, Samson’s form dipped after moving down the order to accommodate Shubman Gill. Although management reinstated him at the top for the World Cup, he struggled to cement his spot.Just 46 runs in the five-match New Zealand series — at an average of 9.2 — has pushed him to the fringes of the XI, especially with Ishan Kishan ’s strong comeback. Samson’s situation remains one of the few uncertainties in an otherwise settled lineup.Known primarily for dismantling spin attacks, Shivam Dube has quietly evolved into a more versatile finisher. He scored 191 runs in 12 innings last year at a strike rate of 152, often playing a supporting role to India’s dominant top order.However, his improved batting against pace during the New Zealand series — 117 runs at an average of 58.5 and a strike rate of 248.93 — has added a new dimension to his game. If that trend continues, Dube could become one of India’s biggest match-winners in pressure chases.Few narratives have been as dramatic as Ishan Kishan’s return. After being out of the national setup for more than two years, the left-hander forced his way back with a stunning domestic run. Initially drafted as a backup opener and wicketkeeper, he grabbed his opportunity when Tilak Varma was injured.Kishan smashed 215 runs against New Zealand at an average of 53.75 and a strike rate exceeding 231, including a century. A rapid 53 off 20 balls in a warm-up match against South Africa further strengthened his case, making him Abhishek’s likely opening partner in the tournament.Even after a decade in international cricket, Hardik Pandya remains India’s ultimate X-factor. His ability to change games with both bat and ball provides balance to a lineup stacked with aggressive hitters.Although opportunities with the bat have been limited, Hardik still scored at a strike rate of 181.57 during the New Zealand series and picked up four wickets with the ball. His presence allows the top order to play freely, knowing there is a proven finisher waiting.The 28-year-old finisher par excellence has been a consistent performer for Team India in T20Is, delivering whenever given an opportunity. His career T20I average of over 45 and a strike rate above 161 underline his reliability and impact in the lower order.He had fewer opportunities last year despite enjoying a stellar run since his debut in 2023. Rinku featured in just five matches in 2025 and produced below-par returns. However, after being named in the World Cup squad as the designated finisher, he reaffirmed his value during the New Zealand series, scoring 91 runs in three innings — including two unbeaten knocks — at a strike rate of 156.89.India’s highest wicket-taker in T20Is with 118 scalps, Arshdeep Singh has become indispensable at both ends of the innings. His ability to swing the new ball and nail yorkers at the death makes him one of the most complete T20 bowlers in the world.He heads into the tournament after an impressive New Zealand series, where he picked up eight wickets in four matches. Alongside Jasprit Bumrah, he forms a lethal pace partnership.Widely regarded as the finest all-format bowler of his generation, Jasprit Bumrah remains India’s primary strike option. With 107 T20I wickets, he trails only Arshdeep among Indian bowlers.His New Zealand returns — four wickets in four matches — may seem modest, but Bumrah’s ability to deliver breakthroughs in crunch moments makes him irreplaceable. India will rely heavily on early wickets from him to unleash their spin attack in favourable situations.India’s middle-overs dominance revolves around Varun Chakaravarthy and Kuldeep Yadav. Varun, the current No.1 ranked T20I bowler, enjoyed a sensational 2025 with 36 wickets in 18 innings at an average of 13.19 and an economy rate of 7.08. Even though his New Zealand returns were modest, his mystery spin remains a potent weapon on home surfaces.Kuldeep complements Varun perfectly. The wrist-spinner claimed 21 wickets from nine innings last year at a remarkable average of 10.23. Together, they present a daunting challenge for opposition batters during the middle overs.Vice-captain Axar Patel continues to be India’s quiet match-winner, contributing with both bat and ball. He picked up 17 wickets last year while adding crucial runs down the order, and a three-wicket haul in the final New Zealand match confirmed his readiness despite a minor injury scare.Washington Sundar, meanwhile, remains under watch due to fitness concerns. The team management is being cautious, with Suryakumar stating that they want him “fully fit… one hundred per cent” before returning to action.Veteran pacer Mohammed Siraj earned a last-minute call-up to the World Cup squad as a replacement for young fast bowler Harshit Rana, who was ruled out after suffering a knee injury during the warm-up match against South Africa in Navi Mumbai.Siraj last featured in a T20I for India in July 2024, although he remained active in ODIs during the New Zealand series in January. The 31-year-old has played 16 T20Is so far, claiming 14 wickets at an average of 32.28, while maintaining a respectable economy rate of 7.79.","India begin their title defence against the United States at the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai on Saturday.

T20 World Cup Groups Explained: Who Can Reach the Super 8

Teen batting sensation Vaibhav Sooryavanshi produced a knock for the ages, playing arguably the most breathtaking innings in U-19 World Cup history to guide India to a record-extending sixth title with a commanding 100-run victory over England in the final here on Friday.On the biggest stage of the tournament, the 14-year-old lit up the contest with a jaw-dropping 80-ball 175, an innings that will be remembered as one of the finest ever in age-group cricket. His knock, studded with a record 15 sixes and an equal number of fours, propelled India to a daunting 411 for 9 after England opted to bowl first. The onslaught left the English attack bruised and battered, with Sooryavanshi dismantling both pace and spin with remarkable ease and maturity beyond his years.Sooryavanshi’s innings also saw him rewrite the record books. He became the fastest player to score 150 in Under-19 cricket, reaching the milestone in just 71 deliveries, and registered the highest individual score by any batter in an ICC tournament final. Having burst into the limelight during last year’s Indian Premier League, the prodigy showcased why he is already being talked about as a generational talent.England, set an improbable target of 412, showed brief resistance in the chase. They kept the required run rate within touching distance for large parts of the innings but lost wickets at regular intervals against India’s well-rounded bowling attack. Caleb Falconer fought a lone battle with a fluent 67-ball 115, but the task proved too steep. England were eventually bowled out for 311 in 40.2 overs, sealing a comprehensive win for India.After the triumph, Rajasthan Royals ’ social media handle shared a touching moment, posting a photo of Sooryavanshi holding the trophy while making a video call and saying, ‘Papa, pranaam’. Fittingly, the young star remained grounded despite the historic achievement.Sooryavanshi dedicated his Player of the Final award to the Indian team’s support staff, saying, “I can't express what I am feeling but the way we have all been working hard for the last 7-8 months and our support staff who have been with us for a long time and always made sure we are alright, I would like to dedicate the award to them.” He added, “For the last eight to nine months, the support staff and the team have been working together. That preparation has played a huge role in getting us to where we are today.”Capping off a dream tournament, Sooryavanshi also became the first player to win both the Player of the Final and Player of the Tournament awards in U-19 World Cup history, underlining his extraordinary impact on India’s title-winning campaign.",India beat England by 100 runs in U-19 World Cup final. Teen sensation Vaibhav Sooryavanshi scored 175 not out. He became the fastest player to score 150 in Under-19 cricket.

Mental toughness



Jitni nafrat faila rahe, main utna mashoor ho raha hoon

Poll What inspired Usman Tariq to pursue cricket? MS Dhoni's biopic Family support Financial incentives Friends' encouragement

Bhai jaan, main yeh 9-to-5 waali zindagi ke liye nahi bana hoon

It was 2017. Haseeb ur Rahman vividly remembers the night he and his cousin Usman Tariq were having dinner and watching MS Dhoni: The Untold Story, a biopic on the former India captain. That night changed Tariq’s life forever. After watching the movie, he decided to pursue his true passion, cricket, and left Dubai for the second time to make a name for himself.“He got motivated after watching Mahendra Singh Dhoni’s movie. What moved him was how Dhoni worked as a ticket collector while juggling his dream of playing cricket for India with his job. The scene that moved Usman was when Dhoni was sitting on a bench at the platform, it started raining, and he then ran and caught the train to head home and give cricket another shot. That scene inspired Usman to take the leap of faith, and I remember him saying, ‘’ (My case is also pretty similar),” Haseeb ur Rahman tells TimesofIndia.com from Dubai.Haseeb says what he saw in Usman’s eyes that day made him believe the boy was destined for bigger things.(There was a stubborn resolve in his eyes, a burning obsession, you could even call it madness),” says Haseeb, with a lump in his throat.Usman followed his calling and left Dubai for the second time, this time with a purpose. Success did not come immediately.He had to toil hard, and one fine day his bowling video went viral on social media.“He joined a cricket academy in Nowshera, which is around 30 kilometres from our village Charsadda. Usman used to bowl to Pakistan cricketer Iftikhar Ahmed in the nets, and one fine day his bowling video went viral,” says Haseeb.“He became a celebrity. People started calling him to play matches for their clubs. They used to pay him between Rs 500 and Rs 1,500. The money helped him with fuel,” laughs Haseeb.“Then I think he got an offer from the US. He played for a small club there. He also played in the Karachi Premier League, where he caught everyone’s attention. Then the PSL came calling, followed by the CPL, Pakistan’s national team and now the ILT20 as well,” he adds.The club matches Usman played would not have been possible without Haseeb, who sent him money to buy a bike.“He used to walk kilometres to play matches. I asked him to buy a bike. It was a gift from me, but after that it was up to Usman how he maintained it. I did my job as an elder brother,” says Haseeb.Before watching MS Dhoni’s biopic, moving back to Pakistan and eventually wearing national colours, the road Usman took was a long one.Usman lost his father very early and, being the eldest in the family, by the time he turned a teenager he was already working and had become the sole breadwinner.“It was in 2007 when his father died. The family was under financial duress,” recollects Haseeb. “He moved to Dubai when he was only a teenager. He worked in a hotel and his job was chopping onions. He did it for a few weeks. It was a tough job and it took a toll on him. One day he messaged me and said he had to stand all day and his back had started hurting. He returned to Peshawar after resigning,” reminisces Haseeb.At the time, Haseeb was working with an NGO in Kabul, Afghanistan.“I asked him to come to Kabul. He landed in winter. The temperature was minus 10 degrees. In Kabul, it goes down to minus 15 degrees at night.“I asked my bosses to help me find him a job. But(When you are out of luck, nothing goes your way). My boss did not give me a positive response,” he says.Haseeb even went to the director of his NGO, offering to take a pay cut.“I told him, ‘’ (Give him the job instead and pay him by cutting my salary, but he should not find out). At least he would have some mental peace. It also did not work out.“We tried a lot, despite the security situation in Kabul. He stayed with me for three weeks. When it started snowing, his back pain worsened. I advised him to go back to Peshawar because he would not have survived Kabul’s winter,” says Haseeb.Usman kept doing odd jobs for three years in Islamabad. In 2016, when Haseeb moved to Dubai from Kabul, his younger brother followed him. But it was not easy, as accommodation in Dubai is very expensive, and without a job, Usman stayed in a labour camp where he shared a room with 20 others.“I did not have a job, and neither did he. I was staying at a friend’s flat in Dubai, whereas he was staying in a labour camp in Sonapur. He was sharing a room with 20 people,” recollects Haseeb.“I invited him over one day. He came all the way from Sonapur. Living in a labour camp is tough, and I could see he was not well. I asked him to spend the night at my friend’s place without even seeking permission. I will never forget the happiness in his eyes,” says Haseeb.After finding a job as a logistics officer in a procurement company, the juggle between life, cricket and work continued.In October 2016, another life-changing moment arrived on Usman’s door when the duo went to a Peshawar Zalmi talent hunt in Dubai.“Those they found interesting were asked to bowl more. When Usman bowled, they were impressed. He was asked to bowl six balls. I thought they would sign him, but they did not offer him a contract,” says Haseeb, who was also the first to suggest Usman stick to spin after he went for runs in a street cricket match played on Sundays near the Hyatt Regency hotel in Palm Deira.“In that tournament, he switched to spin bowling and immediately made an impact,” says Haseeb.A week later, Zalmi called him to return to Pakistan to play matches.“He could not afford to lose his job and said no to Zalmi. He was in tears that day,” recollects Haseeb.Recently, Usman has been in the news because of his bowling action.During the T20I series against Australia, Cameron Green irritably mimicked his action, accusing the Pakistani spinner of chucking. The same happened during the ILT20 in Abu Dhabi, where England batter Tom Banton made a similar chucking gesture.Former India spinner R Ashwin also took a subtle dig. “There is a pause in Usman Tariq’s action, which is legally allowed. His action is unusual and unique, with some variations. Ultimately, the decision on its legality rests with the ICC, the umpires and the match referees,” Ashwin said on his YouTube channel.But Usman found support in former Australia cricketer Usman Khawaja . “There aren’t many things worse than being called a chucker in cricket. The stigma is real. The man is just doing his best and has been cleared twice. Let’s have some perspective and understanding and stop jumping to conclusions,” Khawaja said on Instagram.At Pakistan’s pre-match press conference in Colombo, Salman Ali Agha also came out in support of his player.“I don’t understand why we are talking about his action. In my opinion, it is a fair action. He has been tested twice and has cleared it. In the end, does he need to hang a notice around his neck saying that he is clear,” said Agha.Amid all the noise around his bowling action, Haseeb says Usman remains unfazed and credits his mental toughness.“He jokes about it,” says Haseeb. “He says he does not care. He passes a sarcastic smile and says they do not know that he has cleared the ICC’s test twice. ‘’ (The more hatred they spread, the more famous I become).”Haseeb recalls the time they spent together in Dubai and Kabul and says Usman would often tell him, “(I am not built for a nine-to-five life).”Like Dhoni, whose batting and keeping technique and long hair once led many to doubt him, Usman realised after watching the biopic that he would need to do something special at the World Cup. He wants to be known for his wicket-taking ability rather than his slingy action.","Usman Tariq was inspired to pursue cricket after watching MS Dhoni: The Untold Story.

T20 World Cup | Suryakumar Yadav press conference - On Harshit Rana, 'nerves', strategy

NEW DELHI: Moments after scripting one of the most dominant performances in U-19 World Cup history, Vaibhav Sooryavanshi summed up the sheer joy of India’s triumph not with words of cricketing analysis, but with an infectious burst of celebration. As India sealed a record-extending sixth U-19 World Cup title with a thumping 100-run win over England on Friday, a video of the teenage star dancing wildly with his teammates quickly went viral.In the clip shared on social media, a visibly elated Sooryavanshi can be heard laughing and saying, ""Punjabi gana nahi samajh mein aa rha hai. Bhojpuri lagega.""What followed was a carefree celebration as the young Indian squad danced their hearts out to a Bhojpuri track, soaking in the moment after weeks of relentless effort. The scenes perfectly captured the spirit of a team that played fearless cricket and celebrated with the same freedom.The wild celebrations came on the back of a truly historic final. Sooryavanshi produced an innings for the ages, smashing 175 off just 80 balls, laced with 15 sixes and as many boundaries, as India piled up a mammoth 411 for 9 after being asked to bat. England, bruised and battered by the onslaught, were eventually bowled out for 311, with Caleb Falconer’s 67-ball 115 only reducing the margin of defeat.Reflecting on his approach in the final, the 14-year-old said he trusted his instincts. ""I had faith in my skills that I can contribute in big games and today it happened,"" Sooryavanshi said at the post-match presentation. He added, ""We weren't taking too much pressure. We just thought how we had done well in the tournament, we'll just follow our process and play our natural games.""Sooryavanshi, who was named both Player of the Final and Player of the Tournament, also highlighted the long build-up to the triumph. ""The preparation has been good not only during the Asia Cup (which India lost to Pakistan last year in Dubai), but the last 8-9 months. And only the players know how hard we have worked in that period.""Skipper Ayush Mhatre said the team wanted to carry forward the legacy of India’s recent World Cup successes. ""Rohit Sharma won the World Cup, Harmanpreet (Kaur) also and now we have won it. No words for the support staff, they way they have hustled for the last many months...keep supporting us like this, we'll keep winning you trophies.""As the music blared and the youngsters danced without a care, Sooryavanshi’s words and actions reflected the same fearless, joyful approach that defined India’s march to yet another U-19 World Cup crown.","India win sixth U-19 World Cup with 100-run win over England.

A Father's Pride: How RR, Dravid & Vikram Shaped Vaibhav Suryavanshi

Sooryavanshi tumbles records

Sooryavanshi’s rise

Man of the tournament

Conventional wisdom suggests that a 13-year-old would struggle to even face deliveries bowled at speeds above 90 mph. Vaibhav Sooryavanshi has challenged that assumption by striking bowlers such as Mohammed Siraj, Prasidh Krishna and Jofra Archer to all parts of the ground.In traditional cricket coaching, batters are taught to keep their hands close to the body during the backlift to maintain control over the bat swing. Sooryavanshi differs here as well. His backlift moves away from the body, going against what is often described as textbook technique.Still two-years younger than what Sachin Tendulkar's age was at the time of his India debut, he has a bat-swing that reminds of Brian Charles Lara, Harmanpreet Kaur, and Yuvraj Singh; and like footballer Lamine Yamal, who has emerged as a teenage sensation at the highest level, Sooryavanshi’s age has rarely matched the stage and level he performs on.Talent could never be the question with Vaibhav Sooryavanshi. It never was. With the 80-ball 175 knock against England in the Under-19 World Cup final on Friday, he also put to rest any talks of temperament too, with delivering on the biggest of stages.Sooryavanshi produced what can be counted among the most dominant innings in Under-19 World Cup history. His 175, which included 15 sixes, helped India post 411 for 9 against England in the final at Harare.England, under pressure after Sooryavanshi’s innings, were bowled out for 311 in 40.2 overs while chasing a target of 412 against India’s bowling attack.The 14-year-old reached his century in 55 balls, becoming the second-fastest centurion in the history of the Under-19 World Cup.His innings is the highest individual score in an Under-19 World Cup final and came in the match that also produced the highest team total in a final of the tournament.Sooryavanshi reached his first fifty in 32 balls and continued at the same pace against the England bowlers. His second fifty came off 23 balls.Out of his 175 runs, 150 came through boundaries, with 15 sixes and an equal number of fours. During this phase, India’s scoring rate stayed close to 10 runs an over, and the projected total crossed 500 midway through the innings.He now holds the record for most sixes in a Youth ODI innings, surpassing his own mark of 14 sixes against UAE at ICCA Dubai in December.Sooryavanshi also owns the record for the fastest 150 in Under-19 cricket, reaching the mark in 71 balls. The previous record was held by England’s Ben Mayes, who took 98 balls against Scotland at the same venue earlier in the tournament.Vedant Trivedi, batting at the other end, faced only four deliveries between Sooryavanshi’s 100 and 150, underlining the speed at which the runs were scored.Sooryavanshi first came into wider attention in November 2024 when he became the youngest player to receive an IPL contract after Rajasthan Royals signed him for Rs 1.10 crore. He was 13 years and 243 days old at the time. By then, he had already represented India Under-19 and scored a century as an opener against Australia Under-19 in a four-day match in Chennai.One of the early highlights of his career was the 58-ball century against Australia Under-19, where he scored 104. At 13 years and 187 days, he became the youngest player to score a century in youth cricket, breaking the previous record held by Bangladesh captain Najmul Hossain Shanto.In the following months, Sooryavanshi continued to add records. On April 19, 2025, he made his IPL debut for Rajasthan Royals against Lucknow Super Giants, hitting Shardul Thakur for a six over extra cover off his first ball. He scored 34 off 20 balls in that match.In his third IPL appearance, he scored a 35-ball century against Gujarat Titans, whose bowling attack included Mohammed Siraj, Ishant Sharma and Rashid Khan. The hundred was the second-fastest in IPL history, behind only Chris Gayle’s 30-ball century in 2013.In July 2025, Sooryavanshi recorded the fastest Youth ODI century at the time, reaching the milestone in 52 balls. That record was later broken by Pakistan’s Sameer Minhas, who scored a century off 42 balls against Zimbabwe Under-19.He was named Bihar’s vice-captain for the first two rounds of the 2025–26 Ranji Trophy season in October. The decision followed his performances on India Under-19's tour of Australia, where he provided quick starts and scored a 78-ball century in the first four-day match in Brisbane. He finished as the second-highest run-scorer of the series, with 133 runs in three innings as India won 2-0.In November 2025, Sooryavanshi scored 144 off 42 balls for India A against UAE in the Asia Cup Rising Stars. His century came off 32 balls and was then the joint-third fastest by an Indian in men’s T20 cricket.A few weeks later, he scored 171 off 95 balls against UAE Under-19 in the opening match of the Under-19 Asia Cup.At 14 years and 272 days, Sooryavanshi became the youngest player to score a century in men’s List A cricket. He achieved the feat while playing for Bihar against Arunachal Pradesh in the 2025–26 Vijay Hazare Trophy. He reached his century in 36 balls, later scoring the fastest 150 in men’s List A cricket off 59 balls. He was dismissed for 190 off 84 balls, which included 16 fours and 15 sixes.Sooryavanshi scored 439 runs and took 1 wicket in the Under-19 World Cup and was named Player of the Tournament after India won their sixth Under-19 World Cup title on Friday.""I had faith in my skills that I can contribute in big games and today it happened,"" Sooryavanshi said at the post-match presentation.At 14, Sooryavanshi is already a world champion. He has delivered on most opportunities given to him so far. But he's still a kid. It's important to give him space and not put too many expectations on him. Leave him freely and watch him take the cricketing world by storm.",Vaibhav Sooryavanshi scored 175 runs against England in Under-19 World Cup final. He is the second-fastest centurion in the history of the tournament. He also holds the record for most sixes in a Youth ODI innings. He became the youngest player to receive an IPL contract in November 2024.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128000338,imgsize-69392,width-400,resizemode-4/lkj-50.jpg"

T20 World Cup | 'Our flight is booked and we are going' - Suryakumar Yadav on Pakistan's boycott

India wicketkeeper-batter Rishabh Pant has singled out Abhishek Sharma as the most dangerous batter in world cricket right now, citing the youngster’s consistency and fearless approach at the top of the order.Speaking on India Today’s Salaam Cricket, Pant said Abhishek ’s current run of form is no coincidence, stressing that sustained success at the highest level can only come from a solid process backed by belief.“Going by current form, it is Abhishek Sharma. He is so consistent. Even in the IPL, he has maintained his peak, which means his process works and he is backing it with belief. Every day cannot be tukka,” Pant said.Pant, himself known for his aggressive style, pointed out that performing at a high level across multiple IPL seasons is a strong indicator of a batter’s quality and mental strength.Abhishek is set to feature in his maiden T20 World Cup and goes into the tournament as one of the most prolific batters in the format. Since making his international debut in mid-2024, the left-hander has been in red-hot form, scoring close to 1,300 runs from 38 matches at a remarkable strike rate of 195.Pant also reflected on the influence Rahul Dravid has had on his career, revealing that the former India head coach’s advice continues to shape his mindset.“I think the key is not thinking about it too much and not dwelling on it. There’s one really good line I learnt from Rahul (Dravid) bhai. He always told me one thing: ‘Rishabh, no matter what happens, try to be the same person when you score a hundred and when you score a zero,’” Pant said.The wicketkeeper-batter admitted that maintaining emotional balance remains one of the toughest challenges for any athlete.“I think, as an athlete, that’s the hardest thing to do — to remain who you are. Emotions sometimes get the better of you, but that line always stays with me. So personally, I try that. Whether I score zero or a hundred, I want to be the same guy. Maybe when I get out, it hurts more. I don’t enjoy scoring runs as much as I feel the pain of getting out,” Pant concluded.","India wicketkeeper-batter Rishabh Pant has singled out Abhishek Sharma as the most dangerous batter in world cricket right now.

T20 World Cup | 'Our flight is booked and we are going' - Suryakumar Yadav on Pakistan's boycott

England Test captain Ben Stokes has revealed the extent of a nasty facial injury after being struck flush on the face by a cricket ball during a training session. The all-rounder shared an image on Instagram showing a badly bruised and swollen right eye, a cut on his cheek and lip, and a bandage packed into his nose.Despite the severity of the blow, Stokes took the incident in good humour, captioning the post: “You should see the state of the cricket ball,” accompanied by a laughing emoji.Stokes is currently not part of England’s white-ball plans and will miss the upcoming T20 World Cup. He is expected to make his return during England’s Test series against New Zealand in June.The incident comes in the aftermath of a difficult Ashes campaign for England, which ended in a heavy 4-1 defeat in Australia. Expectations had been high ahead of the tour, with England aiming to win the Ashes Down Under for the first time since 2010–11. However, defeats in the first three Tests meant Australia retained the urn within 11 days. England managed a consolation win in the Boxing Day Test at the MCG before losing the series finale in Sydney.Stokes himself endured a tough series with the bat, averaging just 18.40 across 10 innings. He was more effective with the ball, finishing with 15 wickets at an average of 25.13.His leadership also came under scrutiny. Fast bowling legend James Anderson questioned Stokes’ public praise of his players following the defeat, expressing surprise at the tone of the captain’s comments.“When I saw Stokes come out and say, the way (Josh) Tongue and (Brydon) Carse have just run in like consistently, I had a Roy Keane moment,” Anderson said on BBC Radio. “I was like, that’s your job. If you’re not willing to run in all day for your team, don’t bother. You’re in the wrong sport.”Stokes defended his side after the fifth Test, insisting effort and commitment were not the issue.“We’ve dropped a lot of catches on this tour which have been very costly to the overall situation of the games. In terms up of stepping up, I can never fault anyone’s commitment or energy that they’ve given into this. We haven’t performed well, we know that, we hold our hands up to that. But no one should question the care and commitment to try and go out there and give it your absolute best. It’s just been down to the lack of execution,” he said.Stokes later admitted he had made significant mistakes as captain during the series. England’s tour was also marred by off-field controversy, with a mid-series trip to Noosa drawing attention amid reports of a drinking culture within the camp.As Stokes recovers from his facial injury, the focus now shifts to his return in the longest format, where England will hope for a reset after a bruising Ashes campaign, both on and off the field.Also Visit: England Under-19 vs India Under-19 Final: Match Details, Teams, Date and Venue","England Test captain Ben Stokes reveals extent of a facial injury.

Poll Do you support Sri Lanka Cricket's plea for Pakistan to reconsider the boycott of the India-Pakistan T20 World Cup match? Yes, I support the plea No, I do not support Unsure

Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) wrote a letter to the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) on Thursday, urging it to reconsider its decision to boycott the India vs Pakistan fixture at the T20 World Cup 2026, scheduled for February 15 at the R. Premadasa International Cricket Stadium in Colombo.TimesofIndia.com is in possession of the two-page letter written by SLC, in which it reminded the PCB of Sri Lanka’s past support to Pakistan during challenging times and urged the board to reconsider its stance. The letter also highlights significant financial, logistical and reputational consequences for the co-hosts if the game does not go ahead as planned.“We wish to place on record that Sri Lanka is highly anticipating the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup 2026, particularly in its capacity as a host venue for matches assigned to Sri Lanka. All commercial, operational, logistical and security-related arrangements in respect of these matches have already been finalised. This includes, inter alia, hospitality planning and the sale of match tickets,” the letter read.“It is pertinent to note that ticket sales for the matches scheduled to be hosted in Sri Lanka, in particular the India versus Pakistan fixture, have already been finalised and have recorded exceptionally strong demand, with tickets being sold fast, reflecting unprecedented public interest and significant commercial expectations for Sri Lanka Cricket.Any non-participation in a scheduled marquee fixture of this nature would therefore have wide-ranging implications, including substantial financial exposure for SLC and the potential loss of anticipated tourism inflows and broader economic benefits arising from heightened international interest in the tournament. ”The board pointed out that tickets for matches in Sri Lanka, especially the India–Pakistan fixture, have been sold amid exceptional demand, underscoring unprecedented public interest and significant commercial expectations.SLC cautioned that non-participation in a marquee fixture of this scale would have far-reaching consequences, exposing the board to major financial losses while also impacting tourism inflows and the broader economy.“The Government of Sri Lanka is attentive to the potential impact of a boycott, given the significant economic benefits expected from hosting these matches. Any change to the scheduled fixtures would therefore affect not only Sri Lanka Cricket but also the wider range of stakeholders involved in ensuring the successful conduct of the tournament.""Six Sri Lankan players were wounded in March 2009 when gunmen opened fire on their team bus as it was driving to Gaddafi Stadium in Lahore for a Test match.The incident led to international teams staying away from Pakistan for nearly a decade. That streak was broken when Sri Lanka became the first to play a Test match in Pakistan after a 10-year gap (in 2019).“In this context, we respectfully recall that Sri Lanka Cricket and the Sri Lanka National Team have, on several occasions, toured Pakistan and participated in international fixtures notwithstanding exceptionally challenging and sensitive circumstances, including serious security-related incidents. These have included, inter alia, the attack on the national team convoy, as a result of which certain Sri Lankan players and officials sustained injuries, some of whom continue to carry physical impacts from those injuries to date, while others were left with profound and lasting psychological trauma. In more recent instances, further security incidents, including bombings in the region, placed additional emotional and professional strain on team members, with some compelled to contemplate withdrawal from ongoing engagements,” SLC said in the letter.Newswire, a Sri Lankan media outlet, has reported that Sri Lanka’s tourism and hospitality sector has already felt the impact of Pakistan’s reported decision to skip the February 15 match in Colombo, with widespread hotel booking cancellations across several Colombo-based properties.“Notwithstanding the gravity of these circumstances, Sri Lanka Cricket, in close coordination with the Government of Sri Lanka, remained steadfast in its support of Pakistan and the Pakistan Cricket Board, and continued to honour its commitments to international cricket in the broader interests of the game and international solidarity, at times when several other cricketing nations were hesitant or unwilling to tour Pakistan,” the letter read.“In light of this longstanding support and cooperation, SLC respectfully expects the same spirit of reciprocity and mutual respect to prevail, particularly where the matches in question are scheduled to be played in Sri Lanka, a country that has extended every assurance with regard to security, neutrality and professionalism.“In view of the foregoing, and if any decision has indeed been taken to boycott or abstain from participating in the India vs Pakistan match scheduled for February 15, 2026, we respectfully and earnestly request the PCB to reconsider such a decision. We urge you to take into account the exceptional circumstances, the enduring relationship between our two Boards and the broader interests of the game of cricket.“We humbly request that the Pakistan team participate in all scheduled matches in Sri Lanka, including the aforesaid fixture, in the true spirit of sportsmanship and without selective abstention, for the benefit of the tournament, its stakeholders and the millions of cricket fans worldwide.“We thank the Pakistan Cricket Board and the Government of Pakistan for the highest consideration given to this matter and respectfully look forward to receiving a positive response at your earliest convenience.”On Sunday, the Pakistani government announced that its men’s cricket team will not take the field against arch-rivals India on February 15, without stating the reason behind the decision.“The Government of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan grants approval to the Pakistan Cricket Team to participate in the ICC World T20 2026; however, the Pakistan Cricket Team shall not take the field in the match scheduled on February 15 against India,” the Pakistan government said in a post on X.Also Visit: England Under-19 vs India Under-19 Final: Match Details, Teams, Date and Venue","Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) wrote a letter to the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) on Thursday, urging it to reconsider its decision to boycott the India vs Pakistan fixture.

NEW DELHI: Royal Challengers Bengaluru captain Smriti Mandhana summed up a historic night with a familiar chant — “Ee sala cup namdu” — after guiding her side to a second Women’s Premier League title and completing what she called an “amazing” run of success for the franchise across formats.RCB women had broken the title drought with a landmark triumph in 2024 before the men lifted the IPL trophy last year. Now, Mandhana’s side sealed another chapter in the franchise’s resurgence by defeating Delhi Capitals by six wickets in the WPL final, chasing down a daunting 204.“Very pleased. RCB fans are the best in the world, wherever we play we get a lot of support. Three titles in three years for the franchise — it is amazing,” Mandhana said after the win, dedicating the moment to the loyal fan base. “This one’s for you guys… Ee sala cup namdu 2!”Despite conceding 203 in the summit clash, Mandhana revealed the dressing room remained calm. “We definitely thought it was a good surface to bat on. Of course, 200-plus in a final is a good score, but the way we bowled in the last four overs helped,” she said, singling out Lauren Bell’s economical spell as the match-winning moment.Mandhana also credited Georgia Voll’s aggressive intent at the top for setting the tone in the chase. “Volly led the way… I had a feeling 10–15 days back that she would play a match-winning knock in the final.She has been working extremely hard and I’m happy it paid off,” she added.A key theme throughout Mandhana’s remarks was the role clarity provided by the support staff. “Right from the auction, everyone knew what was expected — the batting order, the phases to bowl. That makes our job easier,” she said, praising head coach Malolan Rangarajan and the management group.She highlighted the team’s collective work ethic as the driving force behind their belief. “When girls are putting in hard yards in the gym and training, you feel you can chase any score,” she noted.While Delhi Capitals suffered a fourth straight final defeat, skipper Jemimah Rodrigues praised her team’s fight, saying, “Could not be more proud of this group… everyone gave their best.”",Royal Challengers Bengaluru win second Women's Premier League title.

Poll What do you think was the key factor in RCB's WPL title win? Smriti Mandhana's performance Teamwork and synergy Effective coaching Support from fans

NEW DELHI: Royal Challengers Bengaluru sealed a historic second Women’s Premier League title with a stunning win over Delhi Capitals in Vadodara on Thursday, but for spinner Shreyanka Patil, the triumph meant something far more personal — a tribute to skipper Smriti Mandhana , who delivered a match-winning performance after navigating a turbulent phase in her personal life.Mandhana, who recently faced turmoil after her wedding was called off, responded in the most emphatic way possible — smashing 87 in the final, the highest individual score in a WPL title clash. Her knock, alongside Georgia Voll’s 79, powered RCB to a record-breaking chase of 204, sealing the trophy in dramatic fashion.After the victory, Patil dedicated the title to her captain, underlining the emotional weight behind the win. “Would love to mention three people — number one, Smriti, because she has gone through a lot in the last couple of months. Would love to dedicate this win to her. Malo and Anya… Today is Anya’s son’s first birthday. And again, Malo — first time he’s the head coach and it’s a special win for all of us,” she said.Calling it a “very special” season after her comeback, Patil thanked fans for backing the team despite the daunting 200-plus target.She finished the 2026 campaign with 11 wickets in nine innings, playing a crucial role in RCB’s title run.Mandhana’s heroic innings not only anchored the highest successful chase in a WPL final but also reinforced her status as one of the league’s biggest match-winners. Delhi Capitals, meanwhile, were left searching for answers after ending their fourth straight season without a trophy.All-rounder Radha Yadav praised the management’s backing and the team’s situational training sessions, saying the hard work behind the scenes played a big role in the title run.For RCB, however, the night belonged to Mandhana — a captain who turned personal adversity into championship glory.","Royal Challengers Bengaluru sealed a historic second Women’s Premier League title with a stunning win over Delhi Capitals in Vadodara.

Suryakumar Yadav press conference: on the India vs Pakistan clash, T20I world cup preps & Washington Sundar injury

85.71% - Rohit’s success percentage in T20 World Cups, the best among captains who have led in 10+ matches.

2 - Rohit is one of only two players to have appeared in the first nine editions of the T20 World Cup between 2007 and 2024, the other being Bangladesh’s Shakib Al Hasan. Rohit also has the most appearances in the T20 WC (47) followed by Shakib’s 43 matches.

1 - Rohit is the only cricketer to win the T20 World Cup both as player (2007) and captain (2024).

9 - Series won by India, including the last 8 in a row, out of 10 T20I series played under Suryakumar Yadav since Nov 2023. The two-match series vs South Africa in South Africa in Dec 2023 ended in a draw.

165.48 - Suryakumar’s strike rate is the highest among batters with 3000+ runs in T20Is.

MUMBAI: When Team India lines up for the National Anthem at the Wankhede Stadium prior to their T20 World Cup opener against USA on Saturday, they will be watching former captain Rohit Sharma place the coveted trophy — which he lifted on June 29, 2024 in Barbados — on the podium. Rohit is the tournament ambassador for this edition of the World Cup.While his selfless explosiveness as opener is being probably matched by another Sharma, in Abhishek, one wonders whether Rohit, who has been part of every T20 World Cup since 2007, will be missed more as a leader. Of course, under Suryakumar Yadav too, India have built up a stellar record in the shortest format.In a pressure-soaked environment of a home World Cup though, Rohit, who often was the zen architect with excellent man-management skills, coupled with tactical empathy for his bowlers and clutch composure, will probably be on SKY’s speed dial during the course of the event.Former India pacer and bowling coach Paras Mhambrey , who combined superbly with head coach Rahul Dravid and skipper Rohit Sharma for three ICC events (2022 T20 WC, 2023 ODI WC and 2024 T20 WC), feels the current regime’s pragmatic approach is based on the reality that Rohit is not with the squad. “The question of missing him does not arise.”Mhambrey, though, hails the impact of Rohit the captain, especially when India ended an 11-year ICC trophy drought in the USA and West Indies.He also endorsed Jasprit Bumrah’s views of Rohit as a “bowler’s captain”, who allows the bowlers to set fields and steps in only when their plans do not work. Paras explains the reasons why he became such a bowler’s captain, despite being such a destructive and classy opening batter who prioritised impact over milestones.“He was completely involved during bowlers’ meetings. When you’re the captain and are playing a World Cup, there’s so many other things happening. Yet, he gave so much of his time to the bowlers and to us as coaches. He was there for discussions. That gave us great communication on the field, knowing the captain was very clear with plans. The bowlers were locked in on them too. If things didn’t work out, he h a d o p t i o n s ready. And what really makes great captains is instincts to read situations and rely on an option which is contrary to the popular one.”That perhaps explains the way he rotated his resources in two high-stakes encounters in the 2024 T20 WC. In the defence of 119 in the league phase vs Pakistan in New York, he kept holding Bumrah back rather than use him up in desperate search of wickets on a pitch that had begun to ease out. Conversely, in the final, when South Africa needed 30 off 30 balls with six wickets left in Barbados, he used Bumrah in the 16th and 18th over, rather than waiting for him to bowl the 18th and 20th.Paras feels the bowlers and the team look for calmness in the leader when things are not going well, and that is something which Rohit gave them. “Rohit is not very expressive and exudes a calm body language. That dilutes pressure and stops it from getting transferred to the bowler. In that game vs Pakistan, despite him wanting the bowlers to defend 120 and look for wickets, he never looked desperate.”Apart from prioritising high batting tempo in the powerplay, the Rohit-Rahul Dravid era will also go down in history probably as India’s most data-driven think-tank. Paras conforms to that view and highlights how Rohit often called Hari Prasad Mohan, the analyst, late at night before games during the WC, saying he needed data on some player.“Another fab guy, Hari, who worked very hard behind the scenes. During conversations, he used to often tell me and Rahul: ‘Rohit called me late at night, wanting a particular bit of data.’ Just shows how much Rohit was thinking all the time,” Paras stresses.The challenge, though, in team environments is often making people see your point of view or buy into what plans you have. Data, something which Rohit was heavily invested in, was one aspect. How did he make others accept the fact that data is important and filter it in a way that did not complicate things? “I don’t think anyone told him that they weren’t comfortable with data,” reveals Paras, and adds that he had the gift of filtering information in a way that the bowlers felt comfortable using. “Maybe, individual X wanted to know four points. Someone else wanted to know only two, depending on what stage of the game he was bowling and to whom. He addressed both quite well.”While SKY has imbibed most things from Rohit’s captaincy style, Paras feels it would be wrong to compare individuals. “When you entrust a captain with responsibility, you got to allow him to function the way he wants. Not every game will run the way you want it to run, but as long as you are consistent with your thought processes, things should be fine.”—Stats: Rajesh Kumar",Rohit Sharma is the only cricketer to win the T20 World Cup both as player (2007) and captain (2024) Rohit is one of only two players to have appeared in the first nine editions of the T 20 World Cup between 2007 and 2024.

T20 World Cup Groups Explained: Who Can Reach the Super 8

As the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup kicks off on Saturday, India will aim to defend their crown with confidence rather than concern over pressure, according to former West Indies fast bowler Ian Bishop . The reigning champions enter the tournament on the back of a commanding 4-1 series win over New Zealand and are the top-ranked T20I side in the world.Since the 2024 World Cup, India have recorded the best win rate among the leading T20 sides. The team has not lost a single bilateral series or tournament in the format. Since the triumphant campaign in the last edition, India racked up 33 wins while losing only six matches, boasting an impressive 84.6 percent win rate. Under the leadership of Suryakumar Yadav, the team is chasing more than just a repeat title — they are also looking to claim a historic third trophy and become the first men’s side to win a T20 World Cup on home soil.Reflecting on the pressure of defending a title, Bishop said at a JioStar media day: “My simple answer to the point of pressure is that you go back to 2011, India won an ODI World Cup at home. They got to the final in 2023 against Australia, who were too good on the day. So look, as defending champions, I think a lot of teams are very good now — management staff are taking pressure away from the players and I think India are one of those teams.There'll still obviously be high expectations at home, but I don't think that will be the issue for this Indian team. So many of them have played the IPL, have played in finals, and they know what expectation is.”Bishop also highlighted key players and match-winners in the Indian squad. “Abhishek Sharma is certainly one of those that you look forward to seeing how he can match up against the best in the world. I think he's going to be a very important guy. They've got so many guys — Jasprit Bumrah, Varun Chakaravarthy.”On squad dilemmas, such as Ishan Kishan’s form challenging Sanju Samson for the opening spot, Bishop said, “He's giving them a good headache, and those are the headaches that coaches want. They prefer to have that sort of tough decision because of good form rather than poor form. If Ishan is playing that well, you have to make room for him. T20 is a game where you have to go with guys in form.""Bishop also emphasised the importance of bowling depth in deciding the World Cup winner. “Bowling, to me, is one of the defining factors in this World Cup. England, New Zealand — they all have power hitters. I think the team that has the greatest bowling depth alongside their batting could be the one that wins the World Cup.”However, he noted that the West Indies, despite their hitting strength, still lack a strong bowling unit. “West Indies have not yet developed that group of potent bowlers that they have been hoping to by this stage,” he said.When asked which teams could challenge India, Bishop singled out England, South Africa, New Zealand, and West Indies. “England, if they get both sides of the game together, could be a threat — they have a game suited to T20 and personnel to do it. South Africa, finalists in the last World Cup, are trending nicely. New Zealand have experience on the subcontinent, so don’t underestimate them. West Indies have power hitting and depth but lack bowling. So there are four or five nations that can challenge India because they have as much batting depth. The question is whether they have the variety of bowling that India can produce.”",The ICC Men’s T20 World Cup kicks off on Saturday.

NEW DELHI: A couple of weeks ago, the Li-Ning Star cycling team dominated the inaugural 2026 Pune Grand Tour. Interestingly, they had barely any leading Chinese riders in their ranks. It was reminiscent of France’s 2018 World Cup-winning team. From Kylian Mbappe to N’Golo Kante and Paul Pogba, France’s triumph was powered by players whose roots stretched across West and Central Africa, the Caribbean, and southern Europe.During the 2024-25 Border-Gavaskar Trophy, Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) sports presenter Paul Kennedy, a former footballer and current journalist, shared an eye-opening statistic: in Australia, at the Under-12 level, close to 40 percent of kids playing cricket are of South Asian heritage.Kennedy even insisted, “Indian or South Asian heritage cricketers might actually be the answer for the future of cricket in Australia.”Elite sport has long moved past rigid definitions of nationality. Athletes frequently represent multiple countries over the course of their careers, shaped as much by migration and opportunity as by birthplace.That reality will again be visible at the upcoming 2026 T20 World Cup, to be played in India and Sri Lanka, where several squads reflect stories that travel far beyond their flags.Nowhere is this more evident than among players of South Asian origin. While around 40 Indian-origin cricketers are expected to feature in the tournament , close behind are those of Pakistani origin.In a country rich in talent and with limited space at the top, the route to international cricket often requires a change of address.The UAE field the largest contingent, with eight Pakistan-origin players in their squad.Among them is pacer Muhammad Jawad Ullah, a 26-year-old from Malakand, whose path to the World Cup has been anything but direct.For Jawad, cricket began as a recreation rather than an ambition.Raised in a family of eight, the game was played with a tennis ball, squeezed in between responsibilities. Coaching was absent, and structure was nonexistent.“In Pakistan, I only played tennis-ball cricket. There was no coach or experienced player to guide me. Many people told me to join an academy for hard-ball cricket. I felt there were so many talented players who did not even get a chance, so I didn’t know what it was at that time, maybe fear or something else,” he told TimesofIndia.com in an exclusive interaction last year The decisive break came in 2020. With family obligations mounting, Jawad moved to the UAE and settled in Khor Fakkan, a quiet coastal town along the Gulf of Oman.The relocation brought stability but little room for sport. He took up work as an electrician, with long days beginning early and ending late, the physical toll leaving little energy for cricket.What time he did find was borrowed. “I didn’t get much time to play cricket, only about one to two hours. Even then, I played with a tennis ball because playing with a hard ball requires a lot of time, at least five to six hours.”Jawad’s journey mirrors that of many who left Pakistan for part-time work abroad, kept their passion alive on the margins, and have now found themselves on the World Cup stage.The Netherlands’ Saqib Zulfiqar represents a second-generation chapter. His father, Zulfiqar Ahmed, born in Sialkot in 1966, played and later coached Dutch cricket, shaping a pathway that saw all three of his sons represent the country.Zimbabwe captain Sikandar Raza ’s journey began with an altogether different dream. His move from Sialkot to Zimbabwe was far from straightforward, taking him through unexpected detours that included aspirations of becoming a pilot and earning a degree in computing from a university in Glasgow, before cricket finally took centre stage after his family relocated to Zimbabwe.“The World Cup is really crucial in every cricketer’s life. And I always think that for Zimbabwe to gain more respect in world cricket, participating in World Cups plays a huge part. So we have the mindset to go there and try to do really well, so that we can come back with our goals set high and our people back home can hold their heads high,” Raza said on the sidelines of the SA20.At 39, Raza now has one clear goal: to inspire the next generation of Sikandars around the world. “All I’m looking at is trying to keep doing the things I’m doing to the best of my ability, and hopefully my performances can inspire other Sikandars in Zimbabwe and across the world,” he said.Then there is USA fast bowler Ali Khan , whose performance against Pakistan in the previous T20 World Cup turned him into an overnight talking point.The two sides will meet again on February 10.From Shayan Jahangir in the USA to Rehan Ahmed and Adil Rashid in England colours, from Italy and Scotland to Oman and Canada, the tournament reads like a map of modern migration.A game once segregated on racial lines in Africa and divided along social lines in England and Australia has become more inclusive and diverse.","Around 40 Indian-origin cricketers are expected to feature in the tournament. Close behind are those of Pakistani origin. The UAE field the largest contingent, with eight Pakistan-origin players in their squad. In Australia, at the Under-12 level, close to 40 percent of kids playing cricket are of South Asian heritage.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127982756,imgsize-64944,width-400,resizemode-4/sikandar-raza-and-rehan-ahmed-photos-by-ap-and-getty-images.jpg"

SURAT: Chennai Singams dished out an all-round performance to beat Tiigers of Kolkata by 29 runs in the final and win their maiden Indian Street Premier League (ISPL) Season 3 title here on Friday.The Singams controlled the final match from start to finish in front of a packed house and in the presence of ISPL Core Committee members Sachin Tendulkar, Ashish Shelar, Minal Amol Kale and Suraj Samat, along with president Operations Dipak Chauhan.After winning the toss, Chennai opted to bat. Openers Ketan Mhatre and Jagannath Sarkar set the tone early.After Jagannath survived a dropped catch in the opening over, Ketan launched a fierce assault, smashing 28 runs in the second over.Jagannath departed for 14, but Ketan continued the onslaught. In the 50-50 over, Saroj Pramanik struck twice in the first two balls, momentarily checking Chennai's momentum. However, Sarfaraz Khan's crucial six kept the scoreboard ticking.Ketan top-scored with 30 off 16 balls, while Sarfaraz added a brisk 20 off 11 deliveries.Late fireworks from Ganesh and Sambhaji, who struck a massive niner, propelled Chennai to a competitive 103 for 7 in 10 overs.Chasing 104, Kolkata never found momentum. Rajat Mundhe and Saroj Pramanik struggled early and Jagannath Sarkar then provided the breakthrough, dismissing Saroj for 11.Although Krushna Gawali and Rajat added 18 runs in the 50-50 over, Ankur Singh struck back by removing Rajat. Arish Khan (25 off 9 balls) showed brief resistance, but it wasn't enough as Kolkata managed to score only 74 for 9, handing Chennai a historic victory.Anurag Sarshar starred with the ball for the Singams, finishing with 3/17, while Sunil Kumar and Ankur Singh claimed two wickets each.Jagannath Sarkar won the Most Valuable Player (MVP) award of ISPL 2026, thus winning a Porsche 911 car, which has been a striking feature of this season and one of the biggest individual award in the history of any competitive sports tournament in the country.ISPL, the pioneering T-10 tennis-ball tournament in India, has grown in stature in Season 3 with emergence of talents such as Vivek Shelar who showed his impressive pace in the competition and picked up a couple of hat-tricks.Ankit Yadav of Kolkata had an amazing show with 16 wickets as well. Falcon Risers Hyderabad's Prashant Gharat scored 203 runs while Ahmedabad Lions' Nizam Ali was excellent with 20 wickets.ISPL Season 3 award winners: Best Batter: Saif Ali (Tiigers of Kolkata); Best Bowler: Parveen Kumar (Falcon Risers Hyderabad); Best Catch: Prathamesh Thackeray (Ahmedabad Lions); Most Valuable Player: Jagannath Sarkar (Chennai Singams).",Chennai Singams win maiden Indian Street Premier League (ISPL) Season 3 title.

T20 World Cup: Squads, Full Schedule, Venues and Key Details Explained

MUMBAI: Amid political tensions between India and Pakistan, USA fast bowler Saurabh Netravalkar said such issues have never been a topic of discussion within the US team, even though many players have roots in the two countries.The India-Pakistan league-stage match of the 2026 T20 World Cup, scheduled in Colombo on February 15, is in doubt after Pakistan refused to take part. However, speaking on Friday, a day before USA’s tournament opener against India at the Wankhede Stadium, Netravalkar said the squad remains focused only on representing the United States.“Yes we have players from all parts of the world. We gel and bond together because of our love for the game. And no I don’t think we have ever discussed the India-Pakistan issues amongst ourselves. I don’t think so at least. We are all proud to play for USA and that's what we focus on,” Netravalkar said.“We are a group of people from multiple countries across the group and what brings us together is the love of the game. We are proud to represent the USA,” he added.For Netravalkar, the match against India will also be a personal milestone.The left-arm seamer grew up in Mumbai and learned his cricket at the Wankhede. He said playing at the venue would fulfil a long-held ambition.“It feels like a full circle moment for me because I learnt my cricket here. I grew up in Mumbai, and getting an opportunity to play at Wankhede, which has been my dream since childhood as well. So nostalgic, emotional, (and) good to see (it happening). I'm looking forward to my family, friends to be there, and I'll give my best,” said the 34-year-old.Netravalkar said the presence of former Mumbai players in the US squad, including Harmeet Singh and Shubham Ranjane, provides some understanding of Indian conditions, though he acknowledged that the game has changed significantly.“It definitely helps, but frankly speaking, it's been a long time. Like, I last played in India in 2014, 2015, things have changed drastically. The game itself has changed drastically. It's become so much more aggressive from the better's perspective, so I wouldn't compare it. Yes, the experience helps, but the game is very different,” he said.Netravalkar was part of the US team that beat Pakistan in Dallas a couple of years ago, when he took 2 for 18 in four overs in a seven-wicket win. On Indian pitches, he said the approach would be different, with the focus on damage control.“The focus will more be on minimising the damage, like you're saying (there are) high scoring pitches here. Every ball that we bowl, (it should be) to the field, as long as we bowl to the field, we bowl to our matchups and maximise our chances. Defence might be the best attack on this kind of pitches and hopefully we induce a mistake on a false shot, that's the best we can do as bowlers on these wickets,” he said.","USA fast bowler Saurabh Netravalkar says political issues have never been a topic of discussion within the US team.

NEW DELHI: Few clubs in Indian football have risen as swiftly or as symbolically as Real Kashmir FC. From their debut season to becoming consistent contenders in the Indian Football League (IFL), the Srinagar-based club has carved out a reputation for resilience and ambition. Yet, as the upcoming I-League season prepares to kick off on Feb 21, the Snow Leopards find themselves navigating a familiar terrain of uncertainty both on and off the pitch.Real Kashmir, back-to-back IFA Shield winners (2020 and 2021), have finished among the top five six times in I-League in the seven seasons they have competed. However, the postponement of the season has created significant logistical and financial challenges, not just for Real Kashmir but for clubs across the league.Club owner Arshad Shawl, who took over as part of the leadership group in 2019, candidly said that the turmoil is the result of a system that leaned too heavily on a single private entity for over a decade.“You have to understand the ecosystem of Indian football over the last 15 years,” Shawl told TOI. “When that private support was pulled out, there was no contingency plan in place.”With the All India Football Federation (AIFF) under financial strain, I-League clubs have been forced to absorb much of the operational burden themselves.For Real Kashmir, the challenge is compounded by geography and climate. Pre-season preparations in sub-zero temperatures, coupled with an an uncertain calendar, have made the task even tougher.“Starting this season is like starting a frozen engine in minus temperatures and asking it to run a rally,” Shawl added.Despite the obstacles, the club’s philosophy stays firmly rooted in local identity. Real Kashmir have consistently prioritised Kashmiri players and home grown talent, a vision reflected in the appointment of former India international and Kashmir native Ishfaq Ahmed as head coach. Under his guidance, the club has become a platform for local footballers to dream bigger. “This club has put Kashmir on the front pages for a happier reason,” Shawl said. “It allowed the world to look at Kashmir through the lens of football.”Beyond the first team, Real Kashmir has invested in a structured youth development, blending local prospects with experienced Indian and overseas players. A capable backroom staff supports the squad.”What continues to hold the club back, Shawl insists, is beyond its control. “We are doing everything that we can control,” he said, pointing to ownership stability, player commitment, and grass roots development.","Real Kashmir have been consistent contenders in the Indian Football League (IFL) The Snow Leopards have finished among the top five six times in the seven seasons they have competed.

Jay Shah’s 2036 Olympic blueprint for India: '8 Medals won’t cut it'

Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola will ask the English Football League for permission to play Marc Guehi in the League Cup final against Arsenal, even though the defender is currently not eligible.Guehi joined City from Crystal Palace in January but was not allowed to play in the semi-final win over Newcastle.Guehi cannot play in the League Cup this season because he joined the club after the first leg of the semi-final.Another January signing, Antoine Semenyo, is eligible, as he was registered earlier in the competition.Guardiola, aware of his team’s defensive problems this season and Arsenal’s threat, plans to ask for Guehi’s inclusion.""Why should he not play? Why not?"" Guardiola said. ""He's our player, we pay his salary, we hired him.""We want to ask. I said to the club we have to ask definitely. I don't understand the reason why he cannot play in the final of the League Cup in March when he has been here a long time.""Of course we are going to ask because it's pure logic.

The broadcast rights for the Indian Super League (ISL) 2025-26 season have been awarded to FanCode after their technical and commercial bids edged six other competitors.

FanCode’s focus on accessibility and fan experience aligns with our objective of expanding the league’s footprint and engaging more football fans across the country.”FanCode had shown interest in Packages A, B and D which covered world feed production, linear TV and digital streaming. But they will be responsible for only the linear TV and digital broadcasts for the 91-match league.

With the league’s strong and loyal fan following, we see a big opportunity to elevate how fans experience ISL through reliable, high-quality broadcast and a product designed around modern football audiences. This is in line with Dream Sports group’s overall vision of making sports better,” said FanCode co-founder Yannick Colaco in a statement.FanCode's initial bid of Rs 8.62 crore for Package A remains to be ratified considering they will not be responsible for the production of the ISL. That job has been awarded to Kolkata-based KPS Studios LLP, who had only for Package E. KPS Studios had previously handled the production of I-League, Durand Cup and Bengal Super League matches.FanCode, UK-based Two Circles, Anandabazar Patrika (ABP), JioStar, Monarch with PR Solutions, Sportzworks and Kaleidoscope (KPS Studios) had shown interest in broadcasting and producing the ISL.Two Circles and Monarch with PR Solutions were both disqualified during the commercial bids evaulation part of the process.

T20 World Cup: Squads, Full Schedule, Venues and Key Details Explained

NEW DELHI: Bengaluru FC players, including India legend Sunil Chhetri , have agreed to take a pay cut for the truncated Indian Super League (ISL) season starting February 14, with club owner Parth Jindal thanking the squad for making the “sacrifice” in the best interests of both the franchise and the sport.Jindal said the management held open and honest discussions with the first-team players about “navigating the situation the sport finds itself in,” as the delayed ISL prepares to restart after being paused for more than four months.Highlighting the challenges facing Indian football, Jindal took to X to explain the club’s position.""Everyone is well aware of the challenging phase Indian Football is going through. For me, as BFC team owner and someone who is deeply passionate about the sport and the club, this has been one of the toughest periods ever,"" Jindal wrote on 'X'.""I am grateful to all the first team players who have agreed to reduce their remuneration during this phase.""Without a doubt, this was one of the toughest decisions we have had to make as a club, and I truly appreciate that the players have made this sacrifice in the best interests of the club and the sport.""Jindal had earlier urged players across clubs to “make sacrifices” citing the “financial burden” franchises would face to participate in the delayed league, even warning that without player support his club might have to “shut shop for good.” While he had not detailed the nature of the sacrifice at the time, he hinted at salary reductions for the season.Bengaluru FC’s squad includes former India captain Sunil Chhetri and star goalkeeper Gurpreet Singh Sandhu. The club has also appointed former India international Renedy Singh as first-team head coach for the upcoming campaign.Last month, FC Goa players, including India captain Sandesh Jhingan, along with support staff, also accepted pay cuts for the shortened season, with the club calling it a “selfless” move and saying it was “deeply humbled by this gesture and immensely grateful for the unity, character, and commitment shown by the group.” FC Goa’s roster also features India players Udanta Singh and Boris Singh.The ISL 2025–26 season was thrown into uncertainty after former organiser FSDL ended its Master Rights Agreement with the AIFF on December 8. Although a tender for a new commercial partner drew no bidders, intervention from the sports minister and negotiations ensured all 14 clubs confirmed participation. A truncated season featuring 91 matches will be played on a home-and-away basis, with each team contesting 13 games.The AIFF has since issued the Request for Proposal for broadcast rights, with bids set to open on February 2. Clubs will bear 60 per cent of the league’s financial cost, estimated at Rs 25 crore. Fixtures are expected to be announced soon.","Bengaluru FC players have agreed to take a pay cut for the truncated Indian Super League (ISL) season starting February 14.

The lawsuit details how Stefon Diggs became tied to a dispute over a stolen Ferrari

The build-up to Super Bowl LX is usually dominated by preparation, pressure, and legacy. This time, however, the focus has shifted unexpectedly toward Stefon Diggs. Just ahead of the biggest game of the season, the New England Patriots wide receiver has been named in a lawsuit that introduces an off-field storyline during one of the most closely watched weeks of the NFL calendar.The lawsuit, first reported by TMZ, was filed by a man who claims he previously worked with Diggs in a professional capacity. The filing outlines a dispute that began in 2024 and later escalated, with the plaintiff alleging defamation, business losses, and physical injury.According to the complaint, the plaintiff says Diggs asked him in July 2024 to arrange transportation for Diggs’ Ferrari from Miami to New York and then to Houston. The vehicle was later reported stolen while in Houston. The man claims law enforcement concluded the theft was carried out by third parties using a sophisticated method and that he was never arrested or charged in connection with the case.Despite that, the lawsuit alleges Diggs began telling people within their shared circles that the plaintiff was responsible for stealing the car. The man strongly denies the accusation and claims the statements damaged his reputation and caused his concierge and consulting business to suffer.He also alleges that individuals connected to Diggs confronted him in public settings in Houston and Miami and demanded the return of gifts Diggs had previously given him.The filing also references a January 2025 text message in which Diggs allegedly stated he was “responsible and accountable for all actions of those around me.” The situation allegedly escalated in December 2025, when the plaintiff claims he was assaulted at Tootsie's Cabaret by two men said to be part of Diggs’ circle. He claims he suffered multiple injuries in the incident, including a torn ACL.The lawsuit names Diggs, additional individuals, and Diggs’ brother Trevon Diggs as defendants, citing defamation, civil conspiracy, and vicarious liability. Diggs has not publicly responded to the allegations, leaving the matter unresolved.","The lawsuit was filed by a man who claims he previously worked with Diggs in a professional capacity.

Cathy Lanier addresses Super Bowl LX security focus and ICE clarification



With Super Bowl LX drawing closer, security operations around Levi’s Stadium have entered their most visible phase, reflecting months of coordination between local, state, and federal agencies. On Wednesday, a U.S. Customs and Border Protection helicopter circled the stadium at an altitude of about 500 feet, offering aerial coverage as thousands of first responders prepared for one of the largest sporting events of the year. The helicopter’s presence allows officials to monitor activity from above while supporting teams on the ground.Authorities stressed that the security posture is routine for a Super Bowl and not driven by any immediate concern. The pilot told CBS News, “Our main goal up here is just to make sure everybody’s safe,” adding that the focus is on “any type of threats, any kind of violent acts or suspicious activity going on.” Live video from the aircraft is sent directly to command centers to help responders assess situations quickly and accurately.Security planning extends well beyond aerial patrols. Barricades are set up around the stadium perimeter, bomb-sniffing dogs are on patrol, and all individuals entering the secured area must pass through screening checkpoints.The Federal Aviation Administration has also enforced a complete ban on drone flights over the Super Bowl, preventing unauthorized air activity during game day. More than 35 agencies have spent nearly 18 months preparing for the event.NFL chief security officer Cathy Lanier said Tuesday that officials have identified no threats linked to the Super Bowl. “We’ve had no credible or specific threats whatsoever,” Lanier said, emphasizing that the planning is precautionary rather than reactive.Lanier also addressed public speculation regarding immigration enforcement around the game. “There are no planned ICE or immigration enforcement operations that are scheduled around the Super Bowl, or any of the Super Bowl related events,” she said, confirming that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement will not be involved.Jeff Brannigan, a supervisory special agent with Homeland Security Investigations, echoed that message. He told CBS News that “the federal law enforcement footprint for Super Bowl 60 is consistent with what it has been in years past.” When asked about the Department of Homeland Security’s role, Brannigan added, “DHS law enforcement at large is participating in supporting the Super Bowl. The focus of DHS law enforcement at the Super Bowl is safety and security. ” As kickoff approaches, officials say the objective remains clear: provide a secure environment while allowing Super Bowl LX to remain centered on the game itself.","A U.S. Customs and Border Protection helicopter circled the stadium at an altitude of about 500 feet.

Tom Brady backs Klint Kubiak ’s coaching style and Fernando Mendoza ’s mindset

Tom Brady does not talk just to fill space. So when the Raiders’ minority owner opens up, people listen. During a recent podcast appearance, Brady shared his thoughts on two names tied closely to Las Vegas’ future. One is a possible head coach. The other could be the franchise quarterback.The comments were calm, direct, and revealing. More than praise, they offered a clear look at how Brady sees the Raiders building their next era.Brady spoke on Let's Go! podcast with Jim Gray on the recent episode. The conversation turned to Klint Kubiak, currently the Seahawks’ offensive coordinator and a leading candidate for the Raiders’ head coaching job after Super Bowl LX.“I thought they did a great job,” Brady said on the podcast, pointing to Seattle’s offense this season. He praised Kubiak for balancing the run game, creating clean reads, and putting quarterback Sam Darnold in spots to succeed. Brady highlighted the motion-heavy schemes and how plays build off each other.""Klint has played to the strengths of that team, and last week’s game, I thought he did a lot of great things against a very talented Rams defense,” Brady said on the “Let’s Go!” podcast. “Gray asked Brady directly about developing a young quarterback.Brady responded by outlining his long-term vision for the Raiders, again on the Let’s Go! podcast. He said his 23 years in the league taught him what young QBs need most. He added that he has built a quarterback development manual and wants the Raiders to become a place that develops the position, not just drafts it.When Mendoza’s name came up, Brady stayed measured but revealing. He said he watched Mendoza in the national championship game and parts of the Ohio State matchup earlier in the season. Brady praised Mendoza’s leadership, noting how he credited teammates during his Heisman speech.TB-12 said, “What do I really value? When I see him, he talks about his teammates. When he wins the Heisman Trophy, and he’s praising everybody else,” Brady said. “That’s an endearing quality for a great leader.”Similarly, in a recent episode of The Herd, Fernando Mendoza also showed his admiration towards Brady and said, “I read the TB12 book. I was always big on preparation. Because, like Tom, I’m not the biggest, I’m not the fastest, I’m not the strongest. But the edge is in the intellect and preparation.”Taken together, Brady’s words justify the buzz. Kubiak brings structure and clarity. Mendoza brings intelligence and maturity. Brady sees value in both, and his influence suggests the Raiders’ next moves will follow that exact path.","Tom Brady backs Klint Kubiak ’s coaching style and Fernando Mendoza’s mindset.

Food at Super Bowl LX. (Levy)

The Super Bowl LX menu has been officially unveiled, and what awaits fans inside Levi’s Stadium goes far beyond standard game-day fare. With more than 70,000 attendees expected on Sunday night, the NFL’s biggest stage is matching its spectacle with a luxury dining experience that reflects the soul, flavors, and ambition of San Francisco itself.This year, Levy Restaurants has been entrusted with the task of feeding a global audience, and the mission is clear. Deliver food that feels worthy of the Super Bowl , rooted in Bay Area culture, and bold enough to surprise even seasoned fans. From shareable indulgences to playful local tributes, the menu answers the key question many fans ask before kickoff: what exactly are we eating for Super Bowl LX?The headline grabber is the LX Hammer Burger, a $180 centerpiece designed to be shared. Built around a massive 3.5-pound braised beef shank, the burger arrives on a salt-dusted brioche bun with blue cheese fondue cascading down the sides. It is theatrical, filling, and intentionally over the top, a symbol of how far stadium dining has evolved.Yet the menu depth goes well beyond its most expensive item. Fans seeking value can opt for the Super-Hot Chinatown Dog, priced at $20 and layered with spicy Chinese mustard, char siu pork, and hoisin glaze.It is a nod to one of San Francisco’s most historic neighborhoods, delivered in handheld form.Seafood lovers are not left out. Dungeness Crab Potachos bring together local crab, crispy potatoes, and rich toppings that reflect the region’s coastal identity. The Gilroy Garlic Steak Frites, served for $35, lean into California’s garlic capital with bold flavor and classic technique.Behind the scenes, the scale is staggering. According to the San Francisco Chronicle, the catering team plans to prepare 10,000 hot dogs, 5,000 custom fortune cookies, 8,000 margaritas, and shuck 4,000 oysters to keep pace with demand.Drinks are equally expressive. From the Fog City Frozen Irish Coffee to the playful Karl the Fog Misty Spritz topped with cotton candy, the beverage lineup mirrors the city’s creativity. Desserts like the San Fran Sticky Roll provide a sweet finish for fans who want the full experience.“We do a lot of cool stuff you don’t typically see in a stadium,” Lou Bastian, the senior vice president of culinary at Levy, told Forbes this week, adding that the LX Burger or the $35 Gilroy Garlic Steak Frites were his picks for the star of the menu.","The Super Bowl LX menu has been officially unveiled at Levi’s Stadium.

Why D'Andre Swift’s Taylor Swift connection keeps resurfacing



D'Andre Swift and Taylor Swift 's connection became a talking point before kickoff chatter filled Media Row in San Francisco. What started as a shared last name turned into a lighthearted Super Bowl week moment when the Chicago Bears running back addressed curiosity around pop culture, family roots, and unexpected fame crossover.Speaking on Thursday, Feb. 5, Swift leaned into the fun without forcing the joke. The NFL star did not claim a headline-grabbing bond. Instead, he answered the question fans keep asking, with humor and honesty, while embracing how sports and music now often collide on the biggest stages.The curiosity surfaced again during Swift’s appearance at the SiriusXM set, where he spoke with PEOPLE’s Janine Rubenstein. Asked if there could be a deeper link to the global superstar, Swift did not shut the door entirely.""I can look into it,"" D'Andre tells PEOPLE of giving his ancestry a deep dive to see if the pop superstar, 36, is a long-lost relative of his, but assumes, ""I don't think so though, I don't think so.""Even with doubt, the Bears running back left room for possibility.""It might be! It might be. You never know,"" he says with a laugh.The timing of the conversation matters. Swift is currently part of Dairy Queen’s playful “Taylor and Swift” Halftime Feast commercial alongside New York Jets quarterback Tyrod Taylor.The campaign leans into name recognition, not family trees, and Swift understands the appeal.D'Andre admits ""it's cool"" to be linked to the 14-time Grammy winner by name, alone, because of the unique opportunities that have come with it, like his latest venture with Dairy Queen.""She's amazing at what she does. It's cool,"" he says of Swift.Though their paths have not crossed yet, the running back keeps the door open to that moment.""I'm looking forward to it!"" he teases, referencing a future meeting with the “Fate of Ophelia” singer.There is also a football layer to the story. In 2023, Swift suited up for the Philadelphia Eagles alongside Jason Kelce, brother of Taylor’s fiancé Travis Kelce . That proximity only fueled speculation, even if the connection remains symbolic rather than personal.","D'Andre Swift and Taylor Swift's connection became a talking point before kickoff.

Matthew Stafford’s MVP win turns emotional as he shares touching family moment and surprises Rams fans on stage

Matthew Stafford and NFL MVP is no longer a debate or a what-if. It is a fact, stamped into league history on a San Francisco stage. After 17 demanding seasons, the Los Angeles Rams quarterback claimed his first Most Valuable Player award, turning a long road of near-misses into a defining career moment. At 37, Stafford did not arrive at this honor by timing or sentiment, but by production, resilience, and leadership.The award came days after the Rams’ painful NFC Championship loss to the Seattle Seahawks, a defeat that ended Super Bowl dreams but not Stafford’s season-long statement. Instead of suiting up in the Bay Area on Sunday, he stood there on Thursday night holding the league’s top individual honor, surrounded by the people who carried him through every high and low. The moment was personal before it was public, shaped by family and persistence rather than spectacle.Matthew Stafford's NFL MVP recognition followed a season that demanded both physical grit and mental discipline. Stafford led the league with 4,707 passing yards and 46 touchdown passes, numbers that stood out even more considering the context. He played through lingering back issues, never missed a game, and limited mistakes with just eight interceptions across 597 attempts.Consistency, not flash, defined his dominance.The voting reflected how tight the race was. Stafford finished with 366 points, narrowly edging New England Patriots quarterback Drake Maye, who ended with 361. Stafford earned 24 of the 50 first-place votes, while Maye claimed 23, underlining how slim the margin was and how decisive Stafford’s late-season command proved to be.What elevated the night beyond statistics was the family presence woven into every scene. Earlier in the day, his wife Kelly shared a quiet moment from their private flight, showing Stafford with one of their four daughters. Hours later, the entire family walked the red carpet at the 2026 NFL Honors show, the daughters matching outfits, Kelly drawing attention in a black dress, and Stafford visibly grounded.When his name was announced as the 2025 MVP, Stafford kissed Kelly and brought his daughters on stage, turning the league’s biggest individual honor into a shared family milestone. The celebration did not stop there. Stafford confirmed he will return for an 18th NFL season, a decision he had not committed to before the ceremony. As he turns 38 this Saturday, the message was clear. He is not finished.","Matthew Stafford won his first NFL MVP award on Thursday night.

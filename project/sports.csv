The southpaw has already become a crowd-puller and, if cricket analyst Daniel Peacock is to be believed, the teenager has the ability to match Sachin Tendulkar and Virat Kohli – or go beyond.

Poll Which aspect of Suryavanshi's game impresses you the most? His aggressive batting style His composure under pressure

Vaibhav Suryavanshi

At 14, Vaibhav Suryavanshi has the world at his feet.While commentating in the second Test of the ongoing Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy, former India coach Ravi Shastri and ex-wicketkeeper Dinesh Karthik unanimously predicted that the teenager is destined to play for the Indian senior team. Former Sri Lanka captain Kumar Sangakkara, who is the Director of Cricket at Rajasthan Royals – the franchise Suryavanshi represents in the Indian Premier League (IPL) – revealed how the teen prodigy is already flooded with endorsement deals.Jos Buttler, who had the best seat in the house when Suryavanshi smoked a 35-ball 100 in a six-fest against Gujarat Titans in April, was floored by his bat swing and compared it to Yuvraj Singh and Brian Lara.Indeed, the teenager, who hails from Bihar's Samastipur district , is special.While the Indian men's team – led by Shubman Gill, once a prodigy himself – has cornered England's Bazballers in the ongoing five-match Test series , India’s women’s team has won a historic T20I series against England . And then there is the India U19 team, who are also making quite some noise on English soil.Suryavanshi played a crucial role in India U19's 3-1 series win over England U19 in the Youth ODIs. The swashbuckling opener amassed 355 runs at a strike rate of 174 while smashing 27 sixes . He then scored a crucial second-innings half-century in the Youth Test Daniel Peacock, a cricket analyst and statistician for the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB), who has been covering the U19 series, shares how the teenager has already become a crowd-puller.“The first time I watched him in the flesh though, I do remember a real air of excitement at Northamptonshire for the second one-dayer – more photos, more press, the BBC had even come to see him play,” Peacock tells TimesofIndia.com.“I knew I was watching a serious star talent. He hit 86 from 31 in a 40-over game [reduced due to weather], which included six fours and nine sixes [match 3 at Northants]. He got a standing ovation after pulling the pacer Sebastian Morgan to backward square leg. The PA announcer, when announcing his score after the dismissal, said: ‘I think we will be seeing a lot more of this boy play.’”“Then at New Road, home of Worcestershire, in a near-perfect all-round performance, he strutted comfortably to 143 off 78 balls. By the time he walked off after being caught in the deep to spin, I think everyone inside the venue had long realised they had just witnessed something really special.”In the ongoing series, there are plenty of youngsters from both sides who are tipped to play for the senior teams in the future. Suryavanshi is at the top. His opening partner, Ayush Mhatre, who had a tough outing in the ODIs, scored a beautiful century in the Youth Test.On the opposite side are Archie Vaughan and Rocky Flintoff – sons of former England captains Michael Vaughan and Andrew Flintoff, respectively, who are touted to be the next big things in English cricket.Suryavanshi’s IPL franchise Rajasthan Royals shared images of fans who drove six hours just to meet the youngster , and Peacock vouches for it, saying the current U19 series is getting more media attention only because of him.“People are starting to make noise about him here. Cricket fans already know who he is – even if they can’t all pronounce his name. These games usually attract a few die-hards, but there’s certainly been a little extra media attention (we’ve had the likes of BBC, The Athletic, Getty, etc.), and a lot of British-Indians have come to watch Vaibhav play in the flesh for the first time,” he said.“I’m sure it won’t be too long until he’s playing at the highest level – Test and international cricket. When he does make his debut and starts scoring big, everyone in the world will know who he is.”There’s already plenty of hype around the youngster, with some calling him the next Sachin Tendulkar or Virat Kohli . But, absurdly, is it plausible that he can achieve even bigger things?“The people I’ve spoken to in the game – I think we all have the same feeling. We’ve watched and witnessed a young star in the making, something very special. I would go as far as to say he’s probably the best 14-year-old in any sport that I’ve seen live. I think the sentiment in England is that we are watching a very special young boy playing cricket – and the expectancy is Tendulkar-Kohli-level, or even beyond,” said Peacock.",14-year-old Vaibhav Suryavanshi shot to fame by becoming the youngest player and century-maker in the Indian Premier League earlier this year.

Indian pace spearhead Jasprit Bumrah is currently the best fast bowler in the world. He continues to dominate the Test bowling rankings, retaining the top spot with a commanding 50-point lead over South Africa's Kagiso Rabada , another modern-day great.Bumrah is the only Test bowler to have taken more than 200 wickets at an average below 20. He has picked up 217 wickets in 47 Tests at an impressive average of 19.48.It is not only his action that makes him unique.His childhood coach revealed an interesting story about the Indian fast bowler when he came to his academy for the first time.""When Jasprit first came to the nets, he had this odd action,"" Trivedi was quoted as saying by The Telegraph.""The boys were confused. They were asking me, ‘Is he throwing it or is this a correct action?’ They thought he was throwing it. I observed his action closely for three days. It was absolutely fine — there was nothing ‘chuck’ about it.“It’s an odd action, so the boys were confused. But I was also surprised at how much speed he could generate at 16.""His run-up was 10 or 12 yards, but he generated so much speed that the boys were afraid to face him because the ball was bouncing so much.And already, he could bowl a very good yorker.”Trivedi also shared what he told a young Jasprit, which proved to be a turning point in his career.“I said to Jasprit: ‘You should not change your action.

NEW DELHI: Following India’s narrow loss at Lord’s in the third Test against England, former India captain Sourav Ganguly shared his views on the defeat, pointing out the missed opportunity despite the batting depth in the side. He also lauded Ravindra Jadeja for his resilient knock, backed by tailenders Jasprit Bumrah and Mohammed Siraj in a tense finish.India suffered one of their most heartbreaking Test defeats in recent times, going down by 22 runs and falling 1-2 behind in the five-match series. Chasing 193, India were in deep trouble at 82/7 before Jadeja launched a fightback with help from Nitish Kumar Reddy, Bumrah, and Siraj. The last two batters faced a combined 84 deliveries but could only add nine runs. Siraj was eventually bowled in unfortunate fashion, ending India’s spirited chase.Speaking during a press event of the 2025 season Indian Racing Festival (IRF) Driver Draft, Ganguly admitted he was “a little bit disappointed” with India’s batting, given their performances earlier in the series.""They should have got this 190, and when you saw Jadeja guts it out and fight and score the runs, the batting quality in this team is absolutely brilliant, and I think they will be more disappointed than I am because it was an opportunity to get 2-1 up in the series against England.Two more matches to go. I am sure they have left disappointed not getting 190. Especially with the quality of batsmanship there is in the dressing room. ""Ganguly added that even a small contribution from the top-order could have made the difference in India’s favour.""Sad from a team's point of view, but Jadeja has been exceptional. He is going to continue to play for India as long as he bats and performs like this. He has been around for a long time. Almost 80 Test matches and more than 200 one-day games.""""And now you can see if batting, bowling, fielding, you know, he's a special player and his batting has really improved over the years with experience and quality. He was actually a top-order batsmen for Saurashtra in his younger days and then became a left-arm spinner. So he has a special player and is a very important part of this team,"" he concluded.During the match, Jadeja also crossed a significant milestone by completing 7,000 international runs. In 361 appearances for India, he has scored 7,018 runs at an average of 33.41, including four centuries and 39 fifties in 302 innings, with a highest score of 175*.In Test cricket, Jadeja has scored 3,697 runs in 83 matches at an average of 36.97, including four hundreds and 26 fifties.

India’s premier left-arm wrist spinner Kuldeep Yadav has remained on the bench for the first three matches of the five-Test series in England. As the fourth Test at Old Trafford draws closer, Kuldeep’s childhood coach Kapil Dev Pandey feels the time has come for the spinner to get his due.Pandey voiced his belief in Kuldeep’s form and readiness, asserting that the spinner can make an impact if given a chance. With India trailing 1-2 in the series — following a loss at Lord’s, a thrilling win at Edgbaston, and a defeat at Headingley — pressure is mounting on the visitors to opt for a more balanced bowling attack. Pandey believes Kuldeep could be the missing piece.“Kuldeep not playing doesn't seem to hold much value in the current context, because Team India has been playing well. In the third Test, many expected him to feature, but the fast bowlers did the job and picked up wickets,” he told IANS.Still, Pandey pointed out that Kuldeep is possibly in the best phase of his career right now. “Kuldeep Yadav is in top form right now. He was lethal during the ODI World Cup and bowled brilliantly throughout the tournament. Not playing him at the right moments has cost India heavily. In the recent matches, it’s the batters who have failed, not the bowlers.”Highlighting the importance of clarity in roles and realistic expectations, Pandey noted how bowlers can be unfairly judged.“You can’t expect someone like Kuldeep or even Bumrah to score 100 runs — that would be unrealistic.”Kuldeep, who made his Test debut in March 2017, has featured in just 13 matches so far despite performing consistently when given opportunities. His coach, however, is confident that the 29-year-old remains focused and prepared.With Old Trafford known to assist spinners, particularly in the latter half of the match, Kuldeep’s variety could offer India better control in the middle overs — an area that has proved challenging in the series so far.Commenting on India’s bowling composition, Pandey said the pacers have done well but leaving out Kuldeep has been a missed opportunity.“I’ve spoken to Kuldeep recently, and I told him to stay fit and be ready to deliver whenever given a chance. All we can do is hope — the final decision lies with the coach and the captain. But there’s no doubt that Kuldeep is currently one of the finest and most senior spinners in the country.“Yes, his morale is high, but deep down he must also be wondering when he'll get his chance — after all, he's only human,” Pandey said. “He can be a crucial asset for Team India in Manchester. I spoke to him; he's focused.”As India aim to bounce back in the fourth Test, calls for Kuldeep Yadav’s inclusion are growing stronger — and Manchester might finally mark his return to red-ball cricket.","Kuldeep Yadav has remained on the bench for the first three matches of the five- Test series in England.

TOI Sports reporter attacked in London: After Lord's Test, reporter faces 'scariest moment of his life'

West Indies cricket legend Brian Lara has declared Shane Warne as the superior spinner when compared to Muttiah Muralitharan , despite acknowledging that Murali posed more pressure while bowling. Lara shared these insights during his appearance on the 'Stick to Cricket' podcast, hosted by former England cricketers Phil Tuffnell, David Llyld, Alastair Cook, and Michael Vaughan.""Shane Warne is the best. He is the best. And you know, I would walk out to bat against Murali, and I am confused. You know, I got that 688 runs in three matches and the first half an hour of Murali bowling, I would be confused,"" Lara stated on the podcast.""I play a sweep shot down to deep backwards square for a single, you know I play a sweep shot again and then all of a sudden, you know, because the other guys did not read him. He is like 'Oh, take out the no bat pad for Lara. Nothing. Nothing. Let's move everybody up'. And all of a sudden, the pressure came off. But Murali gave me more pressure than Shane,"" Lara explained.""That is why I rate him higher, because I think he was mentally stronger. And obviously with his bowling attack and the pitches that he bowled on, which favoured, you know, the McGraths and McDermotts, for him to pick up that amount of wickets, very, very special. I think his strength was his mental thing,"" Lara added.Lara emphasized that while he could middle the ball well against Warne, the Australian spinner possessed the ability to produce magical deliveries and spells.In terms of career statistics, Muralitharan finished as the highest wicket-taker in Test cricket with 800 wickets at an average of 22.72, including 67 five-wicket hauls and 22 ten-wicket hauls. His best bowling figures were 9/51.Warne secured the second position in Test wickets with 708 scalps in 145 matches, averaging 25.41. He claimed 37 five-wicket hauls and 10 ten-wicket hauls during his career.Across all international formats, Muralitharan claimed 1,347 wickets in 495 matches at an average of 22.86, including 77 five-wicket hauls and 22 ten-wicket hauls.Warne, who never played T20 internationals, took 1,001 wickets in 339 matches across formats at an average of 25.51.

Poll What do you think was the turning point in India's defeat to England at Lord's? Rishabh Pant's dismissal Karun Nair's wicket

NEW DELHI: Former India head coach Ravi Shastri pointed to two key moments—Rishabh Pant’s dismissal in the first innings and Karun Nair’s wicket in the second—as the major turning points in India’s 22-run defeat to England in the third Test at Lord’s. The result gave England a 2-1 lead in the five-match series, after successfully defending a modest target of 193 by bowling India out for 170.England captain Ben Stokes ran out Pant for 74 with a brilliant piece of fielding just before lunch on Day 3, which Shastri described as a pivotal moment in the contest.""The turning point for me in this Test match was, first of all, Rishabh Pant 's dismissal. Ben Stokes... simply outstanding presence of mind to hit at the right end and pull it off on the stroke of lunch. Because India would have got a lead and they were in the driver's seat,"" Shastri said on The ICC Review.The second crucial moment, according to Shastri, came early in India's second innings when Karun Nair was dismissed leg-before by Brydon Carse after shouldering arms to a straight delivery, with India at 41 for one.That lapse triggered a batting collapse as India slipped from 42 for two to 82 for seven, handing England control of the game.""Having said that, again at 40/1, I thought that was a huge lapse in concentration from Karun Nair to leave a straight ball, a nothing ball, to leave it and open the door for England. I thought that the timing of that dismissal turned things around,"" Shastri commented.He also praised India’s lower order for their resilience on the final day, contrasting it with the top order’s struggles.""Because you saw when Siraj batted, when Bumrah batted, when Jadeja was batting, once the ball was 40 overs old, they hardly put a foot wrong. They were solid in defence and to bring that target down at lunch, 82 to get, you thought in the next 10 minutes it would be done and dusted. But to bring that 82 or 83 to 22 was a massive achievement. So, it just goes to show that the top order had just been a little tougher and mentally stronger on Day 4, towards the end, this game would have been India's,"" he explained.Drawing comparisons with India’s memorable win at Lord’s in 2021, Shastri noted the similarities in match progression.""It reminded me so much of the Test match in 2021. Only on that occasion, it was India who batted first. Scores were very similar, 300, 300 and then a collapse in the second innings. At that time, India won,"" Shastri observed.Despite the loss, he remains hopeful of a strong Indian response when the series resumes in Manchester on July 23.""Fifteen days in the series, it's been riveting stuff. And at times, I think India could have been 3-0 up. A little bit of luck, India could have been 3-0 up,"" Shastri remarked.He credited England’s ability to capitalise on crucial moments, while also highlighting Stokes’ role with the ball.""You have to compliment England. When the going got tough, those moments they seized. And when they saw an opening in the door, they just banged their door down. There was hardly anything on that surface, and if you had lost two wickets less the previous day I think India would have chased that down,"" he said.""Stokes bowling those spells, I knew something was coming at Edgbaston because he had something back there. He wanted fuel in the tank for Lord's and he showed it on the last day. Eight overs, nine-over spells. At one stage, 10 overs towards the end to clinch it for England,"" Shastri added, referring to Stokes' 24-over effort that included three critical wickets, among them KL Rahul’s.",Ravi Shastri points to two key moments in India's defeat to England at Lord's. Rishabh Pant's dismissal in the first innings and Karun Nair's wicket in the second were major turning points. England beat India by 22 runs to take 2-1 lead in the five-match series.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122577632,imgsize-36810,width-400,resizemode-4/122577632.jpg"

Poll How impressive was Ben Stokes' performance in the match against India? Extremely impressive Very impressive Somewhat impressive Not impressive at all

NEW DELHI: England captain Ben Stokes put his body on the line to lead his team to a thrilling 22-run win over India at Lord’s, according to teammate Joe Root . Stokes delivered a remarkable all-round performance, taking five wickets, scoring 77 runs, and effecting a crucial run-out of Rishabh Pant across two innings of relentless effort.Inspired by their skipper, England sealed victory on a dramatic final day to take a 2-1 lead in the five-match series.What stood out most was the physical toll Stokes endured—bowling a total of 44 overs, including demanding spells of 9.2 and 10 overs on Day 5. It was the most the 34-year-old had bowled in more than six years, despite suffering two serious hamstring injuries in the last 12 months.Root, who captained England before Stokes, said he was amazed by the all-rounder’s resilience and recalled how hard it was to stop him from overextending himself.""You can try, but it doesn't make any difference. I tried for five years,"" Root said.""I mentioned it but he doesn't always listen to me. He didn't listen to me when I was captain!""That's his call now. It was an incredible effort to be able to do that, but that's just how he's built, I guess. He's just desperate to be the man and make things happen.""It's a great sign for us moving forward, it really is, because that's back to his best.He's got that mentality and that desire to win games and we're lucky to have him as our leader.""During the first innings, England head coach Brendon McCullum even sent a message through bowling consultant Tim Southee asking Stokes to take a break. Root admitted he too feared Stokes might reach a breaking point, but now acknowledges that Stokes knows his body best.""I was just panicking that he wasn't going to make it through the game after a couple of bad injuries but he clearly trusts his body now,"" he said.""He knows what he's doing and he's got a good handle on where he's at physically.""After the match, Stokes spoke about his exhaustion, telling reporters he was looking forward to some well-earned rest.He said, ""I could not wait to just lie on my bed for four days and then be raring to go for (next week’s fourth Test at) Manchester.""The fourth Test at Old Trafford begins on July 23.","England captain Ben Stokes put his body on the line to lead his team to a thrilling 22-run win over India at Lord’s, according to teammate Joe Root.

CHENNAI: Former India men’s international Raman Vijayan has forayed into women’s football. Vijayan was on Wednesday appointed the head coach of three-time Indian Women’s League (IWL) champions Gokulam Kerala FC.While ending Gokulam’s IWL trophy wait is high on the Tamil Nadu man’s agenda – they finished runners-up in the last two seasons – he is approaching the task with a broader view. The upcoming IWL season is likely to run from September to January.“Every management recruits a coach with the target of winning a title, so it (bagging the IWL trophy) is the primary goal. But I am looking beyond that,” Vijayan, who last served as the assistant coach of Indian Super League (ISL) club Chennaiyin FC, told TOI.“In the last few years, teams with good squads went on to win the IWL; the results were based on the strength of the squads. I would like to create a difference there. I want to play an attacking brand of football irrespective of the personnel we have. People must look at our team and say: ‘Can girls deliver such a style?’ I will put in all the effort to achieve it. To get there, support from the club and continuity are important,” said the former India forward.Vijayan’s lack of coaching experience in women’s football is not proving to be a hindrance as he strives to turn into a “trend-setter”. Add to it the fact that he will be the chief coach of a top-level team for the first time in his career.“My ambition is to deliver proper football; more than winning titles and matches, I want to introduce a trend that Indian women’s football has never seen. It should help Indian football on the whole as well; I want to create a team from which about five players can go and play for the national team in the future,” added Vijayan.On why he chose to venture into the women’s game, Vijayan said: “I had offers to become an assistant coach again, but I decided that I would only take up head coach’s role upon returning from a break (he was away since the end of the 2023-24 season). I was fine with the I-League or IWL. Indian women’s football has been on the rise recently, so I felt that it was the right time to take up a role in the IWL.”",Raman Vijayan appointed head coach of three-time Indian Women's League champions Gokulam Kerala FC.

TOI

You have had a lot of achievements in your personal and club career. But a trophy with Norway has evaded you so far. How important is that for you and do you think this Euros can change that?

What are going to be the challenges for your team against higher-ranked Italy in the quarters?

You have been a spokesperson for equal rights and pay for women’s footballers and even stayed out of the national team in protest for a few years. Do you think a lot has been achieved in Norway, Europe and around the world in that respect?

What has been the most memorable moment in your decorated career so far?

The Indian women’s football team has a chance to qualify for the World Cup through the Asian Cup. What do you think about that?

Being a top footballer who is also an activist for the women’s game, do you believe activism and professional football go hand in hand?

(Fancode is the official broadcaster of Women’s Euro 2025)

There’s been no stopping Ada Hegerberg since she began playing top-division football at the age of 15. No woman European footballer has reached the level that she has with OL Lyonesse – winning six French league titles, five Coupes de France and five Champions Leagues so far. The first recipient of the Women’s Ballon d’Or in 2018 is also the only footballer with a hat-trick in a Champions League final.Ahead of Norway’s Euro quarterfinal against Italy at Stade de Genève in in Lancy, Canton of Geneva, Switzerland, on Wednesday, the captain, in a freewheeling chat with, spoke about her dreams for a title with the national team, her continued strive for women’s equality and the implication of Indian women making it to the continental stage, and on the world stage someday. Excerpts:Well, we were very close in 2013. We went to the final and we could have been European champs. Yes, I would love to do well for Norway, and I feel we couldn’t be in a better position than we are now to do that. Sometimes, we need to take into account that we’re a very small country of 5.5 million and we’re going to play a quarterfinal in the Euros. And the way we got there makes me incredibly proud of the girls because we’ve been working very hard to get to where we are at the moment, and now I think you need to enjoy it.But standing here after three games, winning all three, is a fantastic situation to be in. So, you kind of pinch yourself sometimes and feel grateful. And I feel very positive going into this quarterfinal.First, we respect Italy a lot. They have a good team, they’re very stable, they have good players, they’ve had good results coming into the Euro, so no game is going to be easy. And that’s the kind of mentality we have as well — that you must fight for every point and every ball. And it’s a big, big country we’re playing against. But at the same time, we must go into the game with belief in ourselves, positivity and will to fight for our country, for our teammates. And I hope we get a lot of Norwegians that we managed to engage behind us. It’s a big moment for us. So, it’s going to be challenging, but I hope we enjoy every minute of it.Throughout my career, I would say that development has been incredible. You have to be honest about that. But it’s always about making sure that we take the next step in the right direction. And sometimes I think you need to be alert about which decisions are being made for your sports on a national level. In Norway, Lise Klaveness becoming the federation president has been of huge importance. She’s a very impressive Norwegian woman who stands for lots of positives and backs women’s football fully. So, I feel like we’re heard and seen by our leader in Norwegian football. And I think having characters like her is hugely important for the sport because it’s all about taking the right decisions and you need people on top to take them for us. But as a player, you just want the sport to be in a better position than what you found it to be in. And I think in my time in the game, a lot of things have happened. But we still have to fight for things to change. We’re not there yet, but we’re on our way and we have to stand together and make sure it happens together.Oh, I feel very lucky. It’s hard to pick one. I think I’m going to take a step back when I have retired and look at this crazy career. What a journey it’s been — the highest of highs, the lowest of lows. All those Champions League finals have been absolutely some of the best memories. Scoring a hat-trick in a Champions League final is unheard of. And, at the same time, representing Norway is a huge thing for me. Something that makes me feel proud is seeing young girls and boys coming to our games and cheering for us. That’s what drives us as footballers — seeing the next generation get inspired.India is such a big nation. Imagine how many girls want the opportunity to do what they love and play the beautiful game. So, obviously, having the Indian women’s national team at the top stage representing India, there’s nothing better for the next generation of girls growing up. It’s a way of educating society as well. So, it’s huge. And with the huge population of India, imagine all the talent that is everywhere. And once you take care of that talent, the things you can achieve over time are limitless.I think I realised quite a long time ago that being a woman’s footballer and not fighting for equality is impossible. I think it’s a challenge because it brings a lot of responsibility. But it’s totally worth it. I see the change and the impact we can have. Obviously, if you don’t perform, you won’t have that voice, either. So, it’s always performance first and then I think of what can I do to have an impact on my own sports? What can I do to have an impact on the next generation growing up? Once I’m done in the game, there’s going to be new ones. Being brilliant in the game, taking on that responsibility, and it’s going to continue. That’s the cycle of life. It’s the way of history and women’s equality. It will always be a constant discussion, constant battle, and it can be tiring and very challenging. But it’s worth it and needs to be done.","Ada Hegerberg is the first recipient of the Women’s Ballon d’Or in 2018. She is also the only footballer with a hat-trick in a Champions League final.

All this fuss has come about purely because it was Lamine Yamal's party.""The performer explained their work involves dancing, delivering drinks, and performing magic tricks at events.Dominican rapper Chimbala, who is of short stature, shared a video on Instagram of himself performing at the party with Yamal, while Barcelona teammates Gavi and Alejandro Balde danced nearby.Chimbala posted: ""Lamine Yamal at 18, the best player in the world, signing my song 'Abusadora', thank you for inviting me to your (birthday).""Yamal has established himself as a significant player for Barcelona, contributing to the team's domestic treble last season, winning La Liga, the Copa del Rey, and Spanish Super Cup.The Spain international has accumulated an impressive record of 25 goals in 106 appearances since his debut at age 15 in 2023, and is now considered a contender for the Ballon d'Or.Yamal's representatives have not responded to requests for comment regarding the investigation.",Barcelona's Lamine Yamal is under investigation by Spain's Ministry of Social Rights.

Cristiano Ronaldo dos Santos, son of Portuguese superstar and Al-Nassr forward Cristiano Ronaldo is among the most exciting talents to look out for in world football. Primarily operating as a left-winger like his father, he can also be deployed on the right wing. He is a right-footed player.Born on June 17, 2010, the 15-year-old, who is coming up in terms of both footballing ability and popularity, recently went viral for a claim that Barcelona star Lamine Yamal 'has not won anything' in his career yet. While he did admit that Yamal is better than his father in terms of ability at the moment, he did argue Yamal's lack of trophies is a caveat.From playing for the youth teams of Juventus, Manchester United and now Al-Nassr, the teenager has more or less mirrored his father's career trajectory, albeit for their academies, U15 and youth teams. Here's a closer look at the young star's career trajectory.Cristiano Jr. followed in the footsteps of his father as he made the move from Spanish giant Al-Nassr to Juventus following the latter's move from the 15-time Champions League winners in July 2018. After starting his career with the U9 side, he rose up the ranks to U11 by the time he left them in 2021/22.The young star created excitement in his first season with Juventus, where he reportedly scored 58 goals and assisted 18 times in a season as a 9-year-old.Cristiano Jr. also scored four goals in his debut for the U9 side, as per reports.As Ronaldo made the move from Juventus and returned to Manchester United, his son also followed suit. Playing for the Red Devils in their U12 and then U13 sides, the teenager got to share the pitch with the likes of Kai Rooney, son of the legendary Wayne Rooney.The teenager wore the No 7 like his father while with the Red Devils' team, with clips of him imitating his father's iconic 'siuuu' celebration also going viral.After Ronaldo left the Premier League giants in late 2022, he made the surprising call to move his career to the Saudi Pro League with Al-Nassr. The Portuguese superstar is under contract with the team till 2027, and his son too, plays for their U15 side.He signed for the Al-Nassr U15 team on 1st January 2023.Despite having both Portuguese and US citizenship, Cristiano Jr. has opted to represent Portugal at national level. The player was called up to represent the Portuguese U15 side back in May 2025, for which he made 4 appearances, scoring two goals.The forward represented his country at the Vlatko Markovic Tournament in Croatia in May. With the forward already in the national team setup, his 40-year-old father has already expressed his desire to share the pitch with his son one day.","Cristiano Ronaldo Jr. is the son of Portuguese superstar and Al-Nassr forward Cristiano Ronaldo.

Poll Do you think Jorge Jesus will lead Al Nassr to win titles? Yes, definitely No, I don't think so.

Jorge Jesus has been named the new head coach of Saudi Arabian club Al Nassr, replacing Stefano Pioli. The Portuguese coach said he joined the team after an invitation from star man Cristiano Ronaldo “Without his invitation, I certainly wouldn't be there. The motivation will be great. I'm going to try to ensure that Al Nassr, which is one of the best clubs in Saudi Arabia, can win titles. Cristiano Ronaldo is a player who has always won everything he's played for. He hasn't won in Saudi Arabia yet. I'll see if I can help him,” Jesus told reporters, as quoted by IANS.Jesus had earlier managed Al Nassr’s rivals Al Hilal SFC for two seasons. He left the club after their AFC Champions League Elite 2024/25 semi-final exit. However, he enjoyed success during his time there, winning the Saudi Pro League, King’s Cup, and Saudi Super Cup in the 2023/24 season.The 70-year-old has also coached major clubs like Benfica and Sporting CP in Portugal, and Flamengo in Brazil.At Al Nassr, Jesus will work with Ronaldo, who recently extended his contract with the club until 2027. The Portuguese star welcomed the coach on social media, writing, “Bem-vindo (Welcome), Mister Jorge Jesus,” on an Instagram Story.Ronaldo joined Al Nassr in late 2022 after leaving Manchester United.

Barcelona star Lamine Yamal, who recently turned 18, has come under an intense wave of criticism following reports that the player hired people with dwarfism to act as entertainers for his birthday party. The Barcelona man, who is yet to make a statement on the same, has returned to Barcelona for pre-season ahead of the 2025/26 campaign.One of the entertainers hired for Yamal’s party has defended the event after criticism from a disability rights group. The birthday celebration of the Barcelona star included a Dominican rapper, a mafia-themed dress code, and entertainers with dwarfism, from which the last sparked a strong reaction from the Association of People with Achondroplasia and Other Bone Dysplasias (ADEE).ADEE called the act degrading and has vowed to take ""legal and social"" action against the organisers, as per an official statement on the ADEE website. However, one of the performers at the party has pushed back, saying they were treated with respect and had every right to do their job.“No one disrespected us, let us work in peace. I don't understand why there's so much hype,” the entertainer told RAC1. “We're normal people who do what we want, in an absolutely legal way.”The artist also criticised the association for trying to limit job options for people with dwarfism. “(ADEE) is humiliating people with dwarfism. For a couple of years now, these people have been harming us; they want to ban a job that we like, and in no case have they offered jobs or courses to the affected people,” he told RAC1.“We work as entertainers. Why can't we do it? Because of our physical condition?”He also said that the current backlash has more to do with ADEE’s internal politics than the event itself. “There is a new president who feels self-conscious and wants to screw us others. We know what our limit is and we will never exceed it: we are not fairground monkeys,” he said.Describing what they did at the party, the artist said they danced, served drinks, and performed magic. “There are many types of shows,” he added. “Afterwards, we joined the rest of the party like everyone else. The only reason there’s backlash is because it was Lamine Yamal’s party.”","Barcelona star Lamine Yamal hired people with dwarfism for his birthday party.

Oliver Rowland was worried after how Round 13 turned out in Berlin

Formula E Berlin Round 14 – 60‑Second Blitz!

Pascal Wehrlein’s Round 14 performance sealed Oliver Rowland’s championship win

Oliver Rowland looking forward to his home race now



Oliver Rowland’s fans kept their fingers crossed and waited with bated breath for the Nissan driver to seal his Formula E World Championship at the Round 13 race in Berlin on Saturday. But the day ended on a sad note for the driver as he failed to even finish the race, while his closest competitor, Pascal Wehrlein, clinched second spot on the podium, closing the gap between them in the Formula E Driver Standings. Rowland has confirmed that he did doubt his championship win when things didn’t play out well that day.There was reason to be worried for Nissan driver Oliver Rowland when TAG Heuer Porsche’s Pascal Wehrlein closed the gap between them in the Driver Standings to 50 points. He was second in the Formula E Driver Standings and could have changed the championship outcome with two more races remaining in the season.Sharing his fears in an interview with Formula E, he said, “I was hoping before the weekend that the outcome could be [the World Championship], but after yesterday (Saturday) and this morning (Sunday) I was more worried that it might never come.”Pascal Wehrlein ended 15th in the Round 14 race on Sunday despite starting from pole position.Rowland eventually bounced back to finally seal his championship win by finishing fourth in the race. He missed out on the podium, which had Jaguar TCS Racing’s Nick Cassidy as the winner, but his 12 points, along with his closest competitor Pascal Wehrlein’s disappointing performance, were enough for him to clinch the championship.“I wasn't aware of where Pascal was at all. My engineer came on, I think with four or five laps to go, and said ‘P4 is good,’ and I thought that's a bit weird. Then I looked at the TV screen, and I got to about eighth, and I thought, ‘Oh, he's not in the top eight then.’ The next time I came around looking again, I found him when I started from the bottom. I didn't know if he'd had a problem, so then I was aware that fourth would be enough if Wehrlein didn't score, so I knew that myself. I didn't want to ask, because I didn't want to jinx anything,” he said.Oliver Rowland took to Instagram on Wednesday to share a post to mark his Formula E Championship win. Sharing a few pictures of his celebrations with his team, the Nissan driver wrote: “2025 FIA FORMULA E WORLD CHAMPION! It still hasn’t quite sunk in what we have achieved this season. I couldn’t have imagined being in this position 2 years ago! Thank you to my incredible team @nismo & everyone that’s supported me!

Jake Dennis is steadily climbing the ladder back to form. The Andretti driver secured second place on the podium in Round 14 of the Formula E race at the Berlin E-Prix on Sunday. This marked his second podium of the season, following his third-place finish in Monaco. Dennis shared his thoughts after the race in Berlin, which also saw Nissan driver Oliver Rowland clinch the Formula E World Championship title.Just a day earlier, Dennis had retired from Round 13 due to technical issues with his car. He had also come close to claiming his first win of the season in Jakarta last month after starting from pole position, but an unfortunate collision with Mahindra Racing’s Nyck De Vries cost him the victory.Things finally aligned for him on Sunday at the Berlin E-Prix, as he capitalized on an Attack Mode overlap to secure second place. The race was won by Jaguar TCS Racing’s Nick Cassidy, while DS Penske’s Jean-Eric Vergne finished third.Sharing a picture of the champagne celebrations on the podium at the Tempelhof Airport Circuit, Dennis wrote on Instagram: “P2!! Awesome race for us and perfectly executed! Great job by the whole team! A moment to say congrats to @oliverrowland1! So happy for you mate, world class all year! World champion looks good on you!”Speaking after the race, Dennis reflected on his recent struggles, having finished 17th in consecutive races leading up to Berlin.“We had a really good race car and the strategy we took into the race was perfectly executed. I had every opportunity to win this race, and we got pretty close. I’m not too surprised to be up here — I’m just super happy for myself and for the team. We’ve been on a real bad luck streak recently, so to reward them with a P2 is the least I could do,” he said.Looking ahead to his home race in London, which also serves as the Season 11 Formula E finale, Dennis said, “I’m excited to have this little boost going into the final stretch, my home race in London. It’s needed. It’s more for morale. Oliver [Rowland] has already won the championship, so massive congratulations to him.

He followed it up with a second victory in Berlin on Sunday, but the Jaguar TCS Racing driver was quick to shift the spotlight to Nissan’s Oliver Rowland, who nearly stole the show by clinching the Formula E Drivers’ Championship with a fourth-place finish. Cassidy has now opened up about his win at the Berlin E-Prix Part 2 — a double triumph for Jaguar after his teammate Mitch Evans won Part 1 on Saturday.Sharing his feelings after the end of the Berlin E-Prix, Nick Cassidy said: “What an awesome race. Firstly, to be honest, I don’t want to take the moment from Oli [Rowland] and the Nissan guys — World Champions with a whole weekend to spare is an incredible achievement. Well done to Oliver, he’s been a class act all year.”Speaking about the team and his race car, he added, “My guys called it perfectly. We had a really good car in the race. We kind of knew we screwed up in qualifying, and I was a bit upset about that, but the car during the race was fantastic—it was awesome. That’s three wins here now. This place didn’t used to be kind to me, but it’s become an amazing venue for me over the years, so it's really cool to have won here for three consecutive years.We’ve been improving all season—it’s no secret that Jaguar is back. The future for the team is very bright. They’re going to keep getting better, and I think that’s been obvious over the past few weekends. I had a fantastic car.”Nick Cassidy posted several pictures from his Berlin celebration on Instagram. Alongside images of him popping champagne on the podium, the 30-year-old captioned the post: “Yesssss! P1 in Berlin!! What a team effort. @jaguarracing.”Jaguar Racing responded in the comments: “That’s how it’s done, Cass.” Sergio Sette Camara, who raced for Nissan in place of Norman Nato, added several clapping emojis. One fan commented, “Massive congratulations!!

Whenever I get into this car, I leave with a smile on my face. ”American F2 race winner Jak Crawford also made a notable rookie return, claiming third place in the morning session while driving for Andretti. Sharing his thoughts, he said, “It was a great day testing in Berlin. I feel like we really got the opportunity to try a lot of setup items and gain a solid understanding of everything.

Hopefully, the work pays off and the team can deliver a strong result in London.”Abbi Pulling, one of the women drivers in the Berlin Rookie Test, drove for Nissan. She looked content with the day’s progress and said, “It was a great day—very productive—and we achieved everything the team needed.

Pascal Wehrlein clinches podium in Berlin Round 13

Pascal Wehrlein fights to secure his position in Formula E Driver Standings

It was a special day for German driver Pascal Wehrlein at his home race, the Berlin E-Prix, on Saturday.

Wehrlein, driving car No. 94, finished second in Round 13 at the Tempelhof Airport Circuit and celebrated the moment with his daughter on stage.Pascal Wehrlein secured his fifth podium of the season at the Berlin E-Prix on Saturday, overcoming a grid penalty received for colliding with teammate Antonio Felix Da Costa during FP1 on Friday.

He captioned it: “I promised you a trophy. P2 at our first home race of the season. Grateful to have family and friends here to share the moment. Let’s go again tomorrow.”The achievement was even sweeter as it helped Wehrlein close the gap with championship leader Oliver Rowland to just 50 points.

Finishing second is a good result, but we had a small taste of the victory. I think pace-wise, we were the quickest, so I tried really hard and it was close in the end. I think we can be happy with today, good points for the team, good points for the championship. Every race is all-in and we try to maximise every one. ”His second-place finish also gave a crucial boost to TAG Heuer Porsche in the Teams’ and Manufacturers’ Championship.Following Sunday’s race, where Pascal Wehrlein failed to score and Oliver Rowland picked up 12 points, Wehrlein remains second in the Formula E Drivers’ Standings with 125 points. While he can no longer catch Rowland, he will need a strong finish in the remaining rounds to protect his position.

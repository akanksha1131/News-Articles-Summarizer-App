IND vs NZ 4th T20I: Shivam Dube's fireworks not enough as New Zealand floor India by 50 runs,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/india-vs-new-zealand/ind-vs-nz-4th-t20i-shivam-dubes-fireworks-not-enough-as-new-zealand-floor-india-by-50-runs/articleshow/127722465.cms,"Shivam Dube blazed away with a fifty of the highest quality, but his lone assault was not enough to save India from a 50-run defeat (Image credit: Agencies)

Sanju Samson headache for Team India | Is Ishan Kishan the right choice?

Shivam Dube produced a blazing half-century of rare quality, but it wasn’t enough to save India from a 50-run defeat against New Zealand in the fourth T20I on Wednesday. Dube’s explosive 65 off 23 balls (3x4, 7x6) stood out in India’s daunting chase of 216, yet the hosts were eventually bowled out for 165 as the Kiwis pulled the series back to 3-1.With Ishan Kishan sidelined due to injury, Abhishek Sharma and Suryakumar Yadav were tasked with setting up the chase. Instead, Abhishek departed first ball, slicing Matt Henry to Devon Conway at deep point. Suryakumar followed soon after, his gentle push brilliantly snaffled by Jacob Duffy in his follow-through, leaving India reeling at 9 for two.Rinku Singh (39) and Sanju Samson (24) attempted to stabilise the innings but struggled to accelerate, both in the Powerplay and beyond. Rinku was trapped lbw by Zak Foulkes, while Samson — who had earlier produced a sumptuous flicked six off Duffy — was beaten by Mitchell Santner’s straight one and bowled.Hardik Pandya also failed to make an impact, and India slid to 82 for five in the 11th over, leaving Dube to shoulder the responsibility alongside Harshit Rana (9).Unfazed by the soaring asking rate, which hovered around 14, Dube batted with freedom and intent.Given a reprieve on 46 via DRS, he reignited Indian hopes by plundering 29 runs off Ish Sodhi’s third over, smashing a sequence of 4, 6, 4, 6, 6. He raced to his fifty in just 15 balls with a six over square leg off Duffy.The sixth-wicket stand added 63 runs, though Rana’s contribution amounted to just four. Dube’s remarkable innings ended in cruel fashion when Rana’s straight drive deflected off Matt Henry’s hand and crashed into the non-striker’s stumps, catching Dube well short. That moment effectively ended India’s chase.Earlier, New Zealand’s innings was anchored by Tim Seifert’s scintillating half-century. Seifert struck 62 off 36 balls (7x4, 3x6) and was the standout performer, though he lacked sustained support after India tightened the screws through the middle overs.Fresh from the Big Bash League, Seifert began aggressively, carving Arshdeep Singh for three consecutive fours — two off edges — before launching Harshit Rana for a towering six over long-on. He continued his assault in Rana’s next over with a six and four, and then sent Jasprit Bumrah to the sight-screen for another maximum.New Zealand raced to 50 in the fourth over and reached 71 without loss in the Powerplay. Seifert’s tempo allowed Devon Conway (44) to settle before accelerating. After crawling to 9 off 9 balls, Conway found his range, taking Ravi Bishnoi for two fours and a six, and then added 35 runs from his next 13 deliveries.However, Conway perished trying to clear deep cover off Kuldeep Yadav, ending a 100-run opening partnership. Seifert soon completed a 25-ball fifty, but India clawed back with four wickets for 37 runs, reducing New Zealand to 137 for four in 13.4 overs.While there was no single magical spell, India benefited from the visitors’ eagerness to sustain the early run rate of 12 an over. That over-ambition triggered a mini-collapse. Daryl Mitchell (39 not out off 18 balls) provided late impetus with some clean striking, lifting New Zealand beyond the 200 mark.",Shivam Dube's 65 off 23 balls stood out in India's chase of 216.

Why Gautam Gambhir is not the ONLY problem | Greenstone Lobo predicts India coach future

NEW DELHI: Former India opener and 1983 World Cup winner Krishnamachari Srikkanth has launched a scathing attack on Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chief Mohsin Naqvi, urging Pakistan to stay away from the upcoming men’s T20 World Cup after Naqvi hinted at a possible withdrawal from the tournament.Pakistan have kept suspense alive over their participation, deferring a final decision until at least Friday and even contemplating a boycott of their marquee clash against co-hosts India in solidarity with Bangladesh, who were ousted from the tournament. The PCB said a final call will be taken either on Friday or next Monday following Naqvi’s meeting with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif in Islamabad.""I had a productive meeting with the Prime Minister and briefed him on the ICC matter. He directed that we resolve it while keeping all options on the table,"" Naqvi tweeted.""It was agreed that the final decision will be taken either on Friday or next Monday,"" he added.Naqvi, who has often blurred the lines between cricket and politics, sparked fresh controversy by suggesting Pakistan might pull out of the T20 World Cup 2026 in solidarity with Bangladesh, whose matches were not shifted to a neutral venue.His remarks drew a sharp response from Srikkanth, who warned Pakistan against touring India, claiming they would be outplayed comprehensively.With India seen as firm favourites, especially with the tournament being staged in the subcontinent, Srikkanth did not hold back.""In the last match, India scored 209 in 15 overs. In this match, they scored 150 in 10 overs. Seeing this, many teams might say 'no, we are not coming. You can keep the cup',"" Srikkanth said in a video on his YouTube channel.""Hey Pakistan, don't come. Your man Mohsin Naqvi has been talking about it - don't come. You will be thrashed. A six hit in Colombo will land in Madras. Beware. The best option is to stay away. Find an excuse and don't come. These boys will thrash them hard. This will send an alarming signal to every cricket team in the world. This kind of hitting in T20 cricket - I have never seen anything like it.""Just hours after Naqvi hinted at withdrawal, Pakistan announced their squad, though officials confirmed government clearance is still awaited.""We are waiting for the government's advice and whatever the government tells us to do we will do it. If they don't want us to go for the World Cup, we will follow it,"" Naqvi told players and coaches in Lahore.Pakistan open their campaign against the Netherlands on February 7 in Colombo, followed by matches against the USA, India and Namibia.

Spin-heavy teams in Asia — smart move or risk? Paul Adams answers

Poll What should be PCB's priority in this situation? Support Bangladesh's cause. Prioritize Pakistan's cricket interests. Maintain harmony with the ICC. Balance both sides carefully.

NEW DELHI: Former Pakistan cricketers and ex-board officials have cautioned the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) against boycotting the upcoming ICC Men’s T20 World Cup in solidarity with Bangladesh, warning that such a move could damage Pakistan cricket and strain relations with the world governing body.The PCB has deferred its final decision on participation after Bangladesh were removed from the tournament, with chairman Mohsin Naqvi setting Friday or Monday as the deadline to either confirm Pakistan’s participation or pull out. The uncertainty has sparked strong reactions from former players, many of whom believe support for Bangladesh should not come at the cost of Pakistan’s own cricketing interests.As per a PTI report, former Pakistan Test captain Muhammad Hafeez clearly backed participation, insisting the team must be sent to the World Cup. Former PCB chairman Khalid Mahmood and ex-board secretary Arif Ali Abbasi also found little logic in withdrawing from the event.“I can understand Pakistan supporting Bangladesh but what purpose will PCB achieve by not sending its team apart from spoiling relations with the International Cricket Council and member boards,” Abbasi said, stressing that the PCB must prioritise Pakistan cricket.Abbasi, who served during the tenure of influential administrators like Jagmohan Dalmiya and I.S. Bindra, also raised logistical and financial concerns. “What about our relations with Sri Lanka? Obviously Sri Lanka will suffer losses if Pakistan doesn’t go as all our matches are in Sri Lanka, including matches with India,” he pointed out.Mahmood described the PCB’s stance as “laudable” but urged pragmatism. “We have to remember that except for Pakistan, no other cricket board supported the Bangladesh demand to move matches from India. I can understand the stance taken by the Bangladesh board but it is also a fact no one supported them in the ICC meeting,” he said.Former Test batsman, chief selector and head coach Mohsin Khan echoed similar views. “We have issues with India but we are playing all our matches in Sri Lanka,” he said, adding that reports suggested the Bangladesh Board would not appeal the ICC decision. “So then on what grounds will the PCB not send its team to the World Cup? It will be bad for our cricket,” he cautioned.Former captains Inzamam-ul-Haq and Mohammad Yousuf urged the PCB to weigh all factors carefully. “I personally would like to see Pakistan compete in the World Cup. We have some good players and our cricket needs to see our team doing well in big events,” Inzamam said.Former Test batsman and ex-chief selector Haroon Rasheed summed up the mood: “We supported Bangladesh, which is a good thing. We took a principled stance, but now is also the time to look at our own cricket interests.”",Former Pakistan cricketers and ex-board officials have cautioned the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) against boycotting the upcoming ICC Men’s T20 World Cup in solidarity with Bangladesh.

Inside details of Washington Sundar's recovery at BCCI CoE | Why India are patient | T20 World Cup

CHENNAI: The Netherlands cricket team returns to India with fond memories from the 2023 ODI World Cup, where they pulled off one of the tournament’s biggest upsets by beating South Africa by 38 runs in Dharamshala. Back in the country for the upcoming T20 World Cup, the Dutch will be hoping to spring one or two surprises again. They arrived early to get accustomed to the conditions and are currently training at the Super Kings Academy in Chennai.But coming up with a good performance is easier said than done, especially when the players are not in a sound financial situation.Fast bowler Paul van Meekeren, a key figure in the Netherlands’ famous win over South Africa at the 2023 World Cup, said the players have had to take pay cuts. “We had to sacrifice a bit of our salary again this year. We can’t really find that main sponsor...can’t find that business that really wants to go on a journey with us for the next two or three years. Instead of a 12-month contract, it has become a nine-month contract now,” Meekeren told TOI on Wednesday.Meekeren, who vividly remembers the last World Cup here, said his team has gained valuable experience and could put up a strong show at this year’s showpiece T20 event.“Before the last ODI WC everyone said that we would lose every single game. From there, to walk away with two wins and compete in a lot of the games showed the strength of this team. It’s another exciting opportunity to come to a country where they live and breathe cricket.“This is my sixth World Cup, and we have a lot of experience in our team now. The starstruck feeling from playing the big teams is gone, so now I think we can focus a bit more on ourselves. We would like more support from the ICC to keep developing the team. It is crucial that the guys get good contracts and focus full-time on cricket. But yes, we keep coming, keep grinding away...”Financial challenges are nothing new for Meekeren. The tall, aggressive fast bowler had to deliver food during COVID after losing his contract in English county cricket, simply to make ends meet. A few years from now, Meekeren, who grew up playing football and field hockey, plans to move on from cricket and explore life beyond the game.“We’re not in a place like India where players can retire, make their money, and do whatever they want. I may probably be back on the market, looking for a part-time job,” he laughed. “I’m 33 now, and hopefully have another four years left in me, a little bit more. But there’s going to be a life after cricket.”But as long as he is donning the orange jersey, he wants to give his all for the team.“I just want to contribute to winning games. If I can help in any way, whether it’s carrying drinks and making sure the guys are hydrated, taking wickets, going for few runs, or taking that one catch in the field – I’ll do it all. I think that’s more important than personal milestones.“I’ve had good memories in India, so hopefully I can make one or two more and walk away with them, because this might be the last time I’m playing cricket here. Sure, the dream is to play in the IPL one day, but realistically, the chances are small. Still, I hope to leave this tournament with good memories.”Meekeren is an admirer of Jasprit Bumrah and is in awe of what the Indian paceman brings to the table.“Bumrah is one of a kind. He’s so different from any other bowler...his action, his run-up, everything is completely different. Trying to bowl like him is so tough. Obviously, I’d like to have his accuracy with his yorkers. Maybe after the match on February 18, I can pick his brain a little, but he’s doing things so differently that it’s sometimes hard to learn from,” Meekeren, who grew up idolising legendary pacers Bret Lee and McGrath, said.",The Netherlands cricket team returns to India for the 2023 ODI World Cup.

Inside details of Washington Sundar's recovery at BCCI CoE | Why India are patient | T20 World Cup

India all-rounder Axar Patel has spoken about how his experiences in recent ICC events helped him move from self-doubt to delivering in pressure situations, saying the 2024 T20 World Cup and the 2025 Champions Trophy played a key role in shaping his confidence ahead of the ICC T20 World Cup 2026.Speaking to ESPNcricinfo’s The Cricket Monthly, Axar said he went into the 2024 T20 World Cup with nerves, largely due to memories of India’s semi-final defeat to England in the 2022 edition. He admitted that his past experiences weighed on his mind before the tournament.Those feelings returned when India once again faced England in the semi-final of the 2024 T20 World Cup, this time on a slow pitch in Providence, Guyana. Axar said he understood the nature of the surface quickly after spending some time in the middle.“I knew batting on the wicket was not easy. I bowled in the powerplay and got Buttler on the very first delivery,” he said, referring to Jos Buttler’s dismissal off a top-edged reverse sweep.Axar said focusing on his strengths helped him deal with the pressure of a knockout match.His role became more important in the final against South Africa, when he was promoted to No.5 with India in trouble at 34 for 3.“I didn't know I was going to bat at 5. It all happened suddenly,” Axar said, adding that the decision was taken by Rohit Sharma and Rahul Dravid.Batting alongside Virat Kohli, Axar scored 47 off 31 balls and helped shift the momentum in India’s favour.“With Virat bhai at the other end, and the way he was calmly manoeuvring the situation, I did not need to worry that much. If the match-up was in my favour, I would go for my strokes and then rotate the strike. Getting about ten runs an over was good, and that is how we calculated our approach,” Axar said.That approach continued into the Champions Trophy final against New Zealand in 2025. Chasing 252, Axar made 29 off 40 balls and took on left-arm spinner Mitchell Santner at a key stage, hitting him for a six.“The equation was very close. Santner was bowling his ninth [eighth] over, I think. Shreyas had just got out. I knew, as a bowler, Santner would take a chance to go for another wicket,” Axar said.India went on to win the Champions Trophy without losing a match, ending a 12-year wait for the title.India will now defend their T20 World Cup title in 2026. Axar is expected to remain an important part of the side with both bat and ball.India are placed in Group A alongside Namibia, the Netherlands, the USA and Pakistan. They will open their campaign against the USA on February 7, face Pakistan on February 15, and also play Namibia and the Netherlands in the group stage.","Axar Patel says recent ICC events helped him move from self-doubt to delivering in pressure situations.

Bangladesh cricket in turmoil: What it means for the T20 World Cup?

The Netherlands make history

Century stand sets up Bangladesh

KATHMANDU: Bangladesh and the Netherlands on Wednesday booked two of the four available spots at the ICC Women's T20 World Cup 2026 as the Super Six stage of the Qualifier got underway here.The Netherlands will play in their first-ever T20 World Cup after quick scoring saw them to victory over the USA by DLS method.Bangladesh beat Thailand by 39 runs as Sobhana Mostary top-scored with 59, while Kathryn Bryce delivered with bat and ball to see Scotland defeat Ireland by the same margin.Quick scoring from the Netherlands powered them to a 21-run win via the DLS method over USA to confirm their place at the Women's T20 World Cup which will be held in England and Wales from June 12 to July 5.Having won the toss, USA scored steadily as Gargi Bhogle's 36 and Isani Vaghela's 32 not out anchored their innings.However, once Bhogle departed at 71 for three, Vaghela was unable to find a strong partner as Hannah Landheer took three for 30 to see USA finish on 129 for seven from their 20 overs.The Netherlands got their chase off to a fast start as Heather Siegers hit three sixes en route to 28 from just 12 balls.Her fellow opener Phebe Molkenboer kept up the charge, making 46 not out from 43 balls before rain brought an early close to proceedings as the Netherlands triumphed having made 90 for two in 12 overs.Juairiya Ferdous and Sobhana's century stand helped Bangladesh to a 39-run victory over Thailand to book their place at a seventh successive T20 World Cup.Opener Juairiya and Sobhana rallied Bangladesh from 12 for two having been put into bat, as Juairiya made 56 from 45 balls, crunching three fours and four sixes.Sobhana fell nine balls after her opening partner, having made 59 from 42 balls, with nine fours, before the lower order wobbled with at least one wicket in every over from the 16th onwards.Thailand were set 166 to win but Suwanan Khiaoto was bowled first ball by Marufa Akter before Natthakan Chantham (46) added 67 for the second wicket with Nannapat Koncharoenkai (29).",Bangladesh beat Thailand by 39 runs as Sobhana Mostary top-scored with 59.

Rohit Sharma opens up on India winning Women's World Cup, & why it was special

MUMBAI: Having played with modern-day legends Virat Kohli at Royal Challengers Bengaluru and Rohit Sharma for India, Sarfaraz Khan is now excited about the opportunity to play with the legendary MS Dhoni for the Chennai Super Kings (CSK) in IPL 2026.""My dream was to play with the legends of this generation. I played with Virat bhai at RCB. I never thought I’d get a chance to play with Rohit bhai, but I did in the Test team. I never thought I’d play with Mahi bhai, especially after he retired from international cricket but after going unsold, CSK picked me in the IPL. I consider myself very lucky,"" Sarfaraz told reporters at the Mumbai Cricket Association's ground in Bandra-Kurla Complex on Wednesday, a day before Mumbai take on Delhi in a Ranji Trophy match at the venue.CSK bought Mumbai's in-form batter at his base price of Rs 75 lakhs in the IPL auction in Abu Dhabi last year.Mumbai will hope that Sarfaraz, who smashed a scintillating double century (227 off 219 balls) against a Hyderabad attack which included India pacer Mohammed Siraj in his last Ranji appearance, continues his blazing form.“I didn't play well in the first 3-4 matches, but it was my fifth double century, so I was excited.I didn't make a century, but I made 40-50. You guys say that I make big runs, so what can I do? Even 40-70 are good,” Sarfaraz added.“I don't think about the future. All I have in my mind is what I have been doing for so many years. I will keep practising, trying to improve. I am working hard in white-ball cricket. I want to play for India in (the) white-ball (format). I’m focusing on that. I am also working with (younger brother) Musheer (Khan) on his bowling and batting.""Sarfaraz also recalled that recuperating for “45-50 days” at the BCCI’s Centre of Excellence in Bengaluru after suffering a quadriceps injury in August last year was “very tough” for him.“The NCA is very tough. You are alone there. The travelling is also long. You travel for 40-45 minutes from the city to the airport. It is very tough. You get frustrated by the injury. You keep thinking, what about me? These things keep happening,” he added.",Sarfaraz Khan is excited about the opportunity to play with MS Dhoni in IPL 2026. Khan played with modern-day legends Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma at Royal Challengers Bengaluru. Mumbai's in-form batter was bought at his base price of Rs 75 lakhs in the IPL auction in Abu Dhabi last year.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127710291,imgsize-21860,width-400,resizemode-4/sarfaraz-khan.jpg"

Planting the seed



The work behind the scenes



Working on skills



Hitting the deck, hitting it hard



NEW DELHI: Chandigarh has had a rich history of producing world-class all-rounders. Kapil Dev , the captain of the 1983 World Cup-winning team, changed the trajectory of cricket in India. Then came Yuvraj Singh, who played a pivotal role in India’s World Cup triumphs in 2007 (T20) and 2011 (ODI). In 2025, the city found its third in Amanjot Kaur, an integral member of the Harmanpreet Kaur-led side that lifted India’s first piece of silverware in women’s cricket.Hailing from Chandigarh, coach Nagesh Gupta calls the ‘Haryana Hurricane’ his childhood hero and once had a single dream -- to give India at least one genuine all-rounder. Instead, he has delivered two world-class all-rounders in Amanjot Kaur and Kashvee Gautam. The latter has now earned a national call-up for India’s tour of Australia in February-March.Just after the squad announcement, a proud Nagesh Gupta shared a post on his Instagram handle with pictures of Kashvee and Amanjot, captioned, ""Two all-rounders. One standard.""""Kapil Dev is like a hero for me. When we started watching cricket, there were only two names that even our parents used to talk about - Kapil Dev and Sunil Gavaskar,"" Nagesh toldin an exclusive conversation.Kashvee has been picked for the ODIs, while Amanjot has been selected for all three formats.Kashvee and Amanjot started practising under Nagesh in 2016. ""Both came to me within a space of four to five days and were my first two female students,"" Nagesh said. While Amanjot was referred to Nagesh by his friend Deepinder Singh, Kashvee was referred to by former Punjab Ranji Trophy player Sanjay Dhull.While both Kashvee and Amanjot began as bowlers, coach Nagesh Gupta soon realised the significant role batting could play in their careers. ""We realised over time that batting is very important. At that time, India did not have many all-rounders, so the perspective was to develop the all-round game that would help them in the long run. Thereafter, we did a lot of work on the batting of both Amanjot and Kashvee,"" he added.Amanjot and Kashvee have both been injury-prone, as being fast-bowling all-rounders puts significant pressure on the body. Amanjot suffered a back stress fracture before the start of the 2025 WPL and was again sidelined for two months due to a back niggle before the World Cup.On the other hand, Kashvee suffered a knee injury during her debut ODI series in Sri Lanka last year and was out of action for seven to eight months.After completing her rehabilitation at the BCCI Centre of Excellence in Bengaluru, Kashvee met her coach, Nagesh Gupta, ahead of the Women’s Premier League 2026 season. In the ten days they trained together before the tournament, Nagesh ensured Kashvee was ready for the marquee event.""I used to call her at a different time than the usual academy hours so that I could fully focus on her,"" Nagesh asserted. ""We started gradually, bowling with a short run-up and low intensity. As she got comfortable, the intensity and number of overs were increased. By the end, she was bowling four to six overs at full intensity, which is required in the WPL.""While Amanjot used to bat in the top order, Kashvee has always been a lower-order batter.T20 cricket is the reality of modern times and while coach Nagesh Gupta has ensured that both his trainees have improved their power-hitting, he has not compromised on the basics.""When Kashvee and Amanjot started playing, women’s T20 cricket was not such a big thing. During the initial years, we worked on making both of them technically strong. Over time, Amanjot’s back-foot game became very strong,"" Nagesh recalled.Whenever there were shortcomings, coach Nagesh stood by his trainees. ""In one season, Amanjot struggled to rotate the strike against spinners. To overcome that, we developed her game square of the wicket, including sweep shots.""The rise of T20s brought a new challenge, which Nagesh addressed head-on. ""Power-hitting is very important in T20s because scores of 180 to 200 are being made frequently in women’s cricket. So we worked extensively on their power-hitting. Both Kashvee and Amanjot do a lot of power-hitting drills whenever they train here.""Kashvee has always possessed a strong inswinger, which has been her stock delivery with the new ball. Earlier, she would simply release the ball and let it do the work. Now, she hits the deck hard, making her even more lethal.Five years ago Kashvee created history by bagging all the 10 wickets against Arunachal Pradesh in the Women’s U-19 One-Day Trophy in Kadapa, Andhra Pradesh.Hitting the deck requires the bowler to sharply flex the wrist in the final milliseconds before release to create backspin, which makes the ball skid off the surface. Nagesh worked closely with Kashvee to add this weapon to her bowling.""If you just release the ball, the batter gets more time to react and the ball is pitched up more often, making it easier to hit boundaries. If you hit the deck hard, the batter has less time to react,"" Nagesh explained.Nagesh also plans to make changes to the bowling actions of both Amanjot and Kashvee to reduce injury risks. ""We have plans to make some biomechanical changes, but for that we need at least a month. Both remain busy due to a tight schedule, but if we get time, we will try to implement them.""Kashvee has made a comeback after missing most of the 2025-26 season due to a knee injury. Amanjot became a World Cup winner on November 2 last year and etched her name in Indian cricket folklore by taking the match-turning catch to dismiss South Africa captain Laura Wolvaardt in the ODI World Cup final in Navi Mumbai.Quality seam-bowling all-rounders remain one of the most sought-after skills in Indian cricket, and Nagesh’s protégés Amanjot Kaur and Kashvee Gautam could go the distance over the next decade.Nagesh is optimistic about their future. ""Kapil Dev is a hero for them too. If their careers reach even 60 to 70 per cent of what Kapil achieved, it would be great,"" Nagesh concluded.","Chandigarh has had a rich history of producing world-class all-rounders. Amanjot Kaur was an integral member of the Harmanpreet Kaur-led side that lifted India's first piece of silverware in women's cricket. Kashvee Gautam met her coach, Nagesh Gupta, ahead of the Women's Premier League 2026 season.

Allan Donald on Virat Kohli’s legacy: Can he reach 100 centuries?

MUMBAI: Ayush Doseja is living a dream season. Playing in his maiden season in the Ranji Trophy, the 23-year-old Delhi batter is the leading run-scorer of the tournament so far, with 790 runs from six matches at an average of 98.75. His tally includes three centuries and five half-centuries, with a top score of 209 against Hyderabad in Hyderabad.Delhi’s Ranji campaign, however, has gone the other way. Winless after six matches, the team is out of contention for a place in the knockout stage. In an otherwise difficult season, Doseja’s run-scoring has been the one consistent positive for the side.On Wednesday morning, Doseja suddenly learnt that he will be Delhi’s stand-in-captain for the last league match of the Ranji Trophy against Mumbai at the Mumbai Cricket Association’s ground in BKC, which starts from Thursday.Besides notching up a flurry of good scores, the youngster seems to have relished a rare opportunity to interact with modern-day cricket legend Virat Kohli, when the former India captain was a part of the Delhi dressing room during the Vijay Hazare Trophy recently. While he didn't get a chance to bat with Kohli, Doseja did receive some vital advice from the cricketing superstar.""Virat sir has been my idol since childhood. I follow his diet and fitness regime a lot.I talked to him a lot when I was with him during the Vijay Hazare Trophy. He said that ‘if you are on the ground and can't give your best, if you don't give 200%, then there is no point in playing.’ Whenever I get down on the ground, I take this mindset that I have to play cricket with 200% effort. I didn't play a match with him. I only got a chance to play after he left, but he did give me a lot of tips,"" Doseja told reporters at BKC.The young gun would’ve made his debut last season, but for an ankle injury that he suffered. ""I twisted my ankle last year, before I was supposed to make my (First-Class) debut. After that, I had the mindset that I have to work on my injury. For two-three months, I prepared for the red ball. It went well, and I am very happy with the season,” he said.Doseja didn't seem perturbed by the sudden challenge of captaining Delhi, and that too against a heavyweight team like Mumbai. ""I have played against Mumbai at the Under-23 level, but this is my first time playing against Mumbai at the senior level. This is my first time playing as a captain at the senior level. It's a very good experience. I believe in destiny a lot. God has given me the opportunity and I will grab it. It will be a very big experience for me. I will focus on my batting and what I am doing well. I have spoken to the players and they are all positive for tomorrow's match. It feels good to play such a big side against Mumbai. Everyone is happy and will try to do well as a unit,” he said.Delhi are out of contention for a knockout berth in this edition of the Ranji Trophy, but Doseja said that won't demotivate the side for the match against Mumbai. ""We will take a nothing-to-lose attitude from here, because there's everything to gain. It's a big team and every Ranji match is a big opportunity. It's a live match and it will be watched by the whole of India. All our players are positive and will get a good experience,"" he asserted.","Ayush Doseja is Delhi's leading run-scorer in the Ranji Trophy.

Real Madrid dropped into the Champions League knockout playoffs after losing 4-2 at Benfica on Wednesday, finishing ninth in the 36-team league standings. Despite scoring twice through Kylian Mbappé, Madrid slipped out of the top eight and missed direct qualification to the round of 16.Benfica secured the final playoff spot in 24th place on goal difference after scoring in the eighth minute of stoppage time. Goalkeeper Anatoliy Trubin scored with a header after Madrid had been reduced to nine players following red cards for Raul Asencio and Rodrygo. Benfica’s progress eliminated Marseille, which fell to 25th after a 3-0 loss at Club Brugge.“This victory is historic and important,"" Mourinho said, adding of his goalkeeper: ""We knew that he could do it. You have to put the ball there, but it’s an amazing goal for the guy.”Trubin said it was a “crazy moment. I’m not used to scoring.

PSG advanced through the playoff round last season on its way to the later stages of the competition.“We don’t have to think about it too much,” said Vitinha, who gave PSG an eighth-minute lead. “We had the same problem last year, and then out of nowhere things changed and the ball started to go in.”Another Mourinho vs. Madrid meeting?The playoff bracket allows the ninth-place team, Madrid, to be drawn only against the teams finishing 23rd or 24th: Bodo/Glimt or Benfica.If Madrid not paired with Benfica, Mourinho’s team would face Inter Milan, whom he coached to the Champions League title in 2010.Bodo/Glimt go throughBodo/Glimt secured 23rd place by winning 2-1 at Atletico Madrid, earning its first advancement to the knockout phase.Other teams qualifying for the playoffs include Qarabag, Club Brugge, Galatasaray, Olympiakos, Juventus and Atalanta.Napoli were eliminated after finishing 30th, following a 3-2 home loss to Chelsea.Barcelona move into top eightBarcelona secured a top-eight finish after coming from behind to beat Copenhagen 4-1.At halftime, Barcelona and Chelsea were both outside the top eight.Copenhagen had taken the lead through 17-year-old Viktor Dadason.Barcelona flipped the game by scoring four second-half goals through Robert Lewandowski, Lamine Yamal, Raphinha and Marcus Rashford","Real Madrid drops into Champions League playoffs after losing 4-2 at Benfica.

Poll Are you excited for the start of the 2025-26 Indian Super League season? Absolutely! Somewhat Not Really Not at all

The 2025-26 Indian Super League (ISL) season is tentatively scheduled to get underway on February 14 with a double header featuring Mohun Bagan Super Giant vs Kerala Blasters at the Salt Lake Stadium in Kolkata and FC Goa vs Inter Kashi at Fatorda in Goa. The fixtures, running until May 17, are provisional as the All India Football Federation (AIFF) is looking to find a broadcaster to showcase India's top-division football.The AIFF is in the process of finding a suitable bidder to produce and broadcast the 91-match competition. If and when the bidder is found, the fixtures could be jiggled to meet the broadcasters' criteria.Four entities - FanCode, Sony Sports Network, Zee Sports and UK-based Two Circles - had attended the pre-bid conference. There is a possibility that more could throw their hat in the ring before the February 1 final date for submission of bids.As the process continues to unravel behind the scenes at the Football House (AIFF's headquarters) in New Delhi, there are a couple of questions that remain unanswered. Chief among them is the relegation clause.Promotion has been a part of the ISL since the 2022-23 season with Inter Kashi the latest team to come up the ladder from the I-League. Relegation, however, has never been a feature of the league that began in 2014.After Football Sports Development Limited's (FSDL) contract to run the ISL expired in December 2025, it is the first time that the AIFF are in charge of operating the ISL. The position on relegation gets trickier because of the Supreme Court-ratified Constitution.As per the Constitution adopted in October 2025, AIFF have the control over relegation rule. As per Article 63, ""Without prejudice to the foregoing, the AIFF shall have the right and discretion to take all decisions of any nature pertaining to any aspect of any competition. While exercising such discretion, the AIFF shall have due regard to the interests of the sport of Football in India and shall not be bound by any request or demand of any third party in this regard. If any of its powers or functions are delegated to third parties, such delegation shall be done in good faith and also ensuring that the AIFF retains primacy on all Essential Aspects.""A closer look at the definition of ""Essential Aspects"" explains it as ""preservation of the sanctity of promotion and relegation, and ensuring of compliance with FIFA/AFC statues with respect to the sport of football.""In essence, promotion and relegation are mandatory from the 2025/26 season onwards in the ISL.An AIFF insider told TimesofIndia.com that the relegation rules will be followed as per what is written in the Constitution.However, a majority of ISL clubs are not happy with the idea. With the season already starting five months late and to be played in a truncated format, the clubs are expecting minimal revenue. The financial strain has forced the clubs to reduce costs through operational cutbacks and salary corrections. A few clubs even paused first team operations before a headway arrived on January 6 courtesy Sports Minister Mansukh Mandaviya's intervention.One ISL club official has even asked AIFF to take cognisance of the situation and invoke force majeure, which is possible as per the AIFF Constitution.Article 78 reads: ""The General Body shall have the final decision on any matters not provided for in this Constitution and Regulations, or in cases of force majeure. General Body shall be competent to decide whether a situation amounts to force majeure scenario or not.""As things stand, AIFF has not approached the Supreme Court seeking a one-time relaxation from relegation for the 2025-26 ISL season. With two weeks to go into the start of the season, it remains to be seen if they will go against not just the Constitution but also the AFC Statutes.","The 2025-26 Indian Super League (ISL) season is tentatively scheduled to get underway on February 14.

Michael Carrick’s comeback as the interim manager of Manchester United has already made headlines, which included victories over Manchester City and Arsenal.

VILA-REAL: Kylian Mbappe netted twice to earn Real Madrid a 2-0 win at Villarreal on Saturday and take his side to the top of La Liga.Alvaro Arbeloa's team moved two points clear of arch-rivals Barcelona, who host bottom-of-the-table Real Oviedo on Sunday.La Liga's top scorer Mbappe reached 21 goals for the season in the competition to help Madrid see off a spirited Villarreal side, who are now fourth.Arbeloa's side have won three consecutive matches across all competitions and victory at Villarreal could be a vital step in the revival of their season.After the shock Copa del Rey defeat at second-tier Albacete in Arbeloa's first match at the helm just 10 days ago after replacing Xabi Alonso, his Madrid have started to take shape.The coach has made clear how important his star players are and none has been more crucial this season than French superstar Mbappe, who has netted 34 times across all competitions.Mbappe and Vinicius Junior ""are the best players in the world, they are players who can really unbalance teams, we try to get the ball to them as much as possible,"" Arbeloa told Real Madrid TV.""They're two players who... I'm really happy to have in this state of form and above all, because of the great work they are doing.""They are really committed to the team, they are the first who are pressing... they're giving this effort and solidarity that we need from them, so I'm very happy that their reward comes in the form of goals.""It was a lively but imprecise start at Villarreal's Estadio de la Ceramica, as the game glowed but neither side was able to seriously threaten.Georges Mikautadze lashed a volley narrowly wide after veteran forward Gerard Moreno found him with a floating cross.At the other end, Madrid midfielder Arda Guler fired straight at Villarreal stopper Luiz Junior after some tidy footwork, and then shot high over the bar at the end of a swift break.Villarreal's Juan Foyth limped off hurt in a blow for the hosts, who created a good chance for Pape Gueye just before the break.The Senegal midfielder, a champion at the Africa Cup of Nations last weekend, powered narrowly wide of the post.Vinicius, who excelled in Madrid's 6-1 Champions League rout of Monaco in midweek, also came close with a rasping effort that sailed across Luiz Junior's goal and wide.The 25-year-old Brazil forward went a 13th straight La Liga match without scoring, but was involved as Mbappe found the net two minutes into the second half.- 'Nightmare for defences' -Vinicius came into the box from the left flank and his low cross was blocked but Mbappe was on hand to squeeze home his 20th league goal of the campaign from close range.""They are a nightmare for defences,"" said Madrid goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois. ""I hope they can keep bringing joy.""Villarreal had the better of the second half as they worked hard to pull level, but Moreno spurned their best chance by firing inches over when well-placed.In stoppage time, Mbappe was felled clumsily by Alfonso Pedraza in the box and the French forward cheekily dinked home the resulting penalty to seal Madrid's victory.Mbappe's team-mate Brahim Diaz, who missed a similar attempted Panenka penalty for Morocco in the Africa Cup of Nations final, was on the pitch to see it as he returned to action for his club.""For you,"" Mbappe appeared to say to Diaz during the celebration, indicating it was a gesture of support.""For me, the most important thing is that (the players) are united, we saw it last Wednesday with Vinicius's goal (against Monaco) and we saw it again today, with Brahim,"" Arbeloa told reporters.The Yellow Submarine are now 10 points behind leaders Madrid, having played one fewer match than Arbeloa's side.""We have to be a bit more accurate in attack against these kinds of teams,"" admitted Villarreal midfielder Alberto Moleiro.Elsewhere, fifth-placed Espanyol fell to a 3-2 defeat at Valencia that left them seven points behind Villarreal.",Kylian Mbappe scores twice as Real Madrid beat Villarreal 2-0 in La Liga.

Widely regarded as one of Europe’s most gifted creative attackers, the 22-year-old Germany international arrived at Liverpool on the back of a standout spell in Bundesliga, where his freedom, intelligence and ability to control games marked him out as a generational talent.In the 29 games he's played at Liverpool across competitions, he's scored four goals and provided seven assists.Before the eventual move to the Merseyside, there was interest also from Bayern Munich. But Wirtz’s decision to embrace the Premier League underlines both his ambition and belief in Liverpool’s long-term vision.In this wide-ranging exclusive conversation with TimesofIndia.com, facilitated by JioStar, Wirtz reflects on the pull of Liverpool’s history, the challenge of meeting sky-high expectations, and the clarity provided by the manager’s plans for the team.Liverpool's immense stature as a club first and foremost. The team that clinched the Premier League last year. Above all, the manager's vision convinced me.Tactics aren't much different from the Bundesliga or Germany duty.In-game, it's the physicality I need to adapt to most.They've had many great midfielders. I just focus on giving my best on the pitch. I don't know what sets me apart—whether I do better or they did. I simply want to play my game and achieve success with the club.Probably the first Newcastle game. It was wildly intense — the early red card, endless long balls, two-footed tackles, everything. The crowd went berserk. That moment made me think, 'This league is different from the Bundesliga.’I don't measure success in specific terms. I focus on delivering my best performance wherever I am — at Liverpool or with the national team—to be vital for the squad and drive achievements. Trophies matter ultimately, as you tally them up, but right now, I prioritise winning them.",Florian Wirtz has had a tricky start to life at Anfield and in the Premier League.

Route 66

Trump Booed Loudly As Miami Stadium Erupts During College Football Playoff

AI to help with planning itineraries

BENGALURU: For those who are preparing to pack their bags to watch the likes of Lionel Messi, Kylian Mbappe, and Lamine Yamal in any of the 11 American cities that will host the World Cup 2026 matches, the Americans are determined to make it football’s best ever showpiece event. Awaiting the fans are fast-tracked visas and curated experiences, including road trips to explore the heart of the US, Route 66 being the most famous of them.The US joins Mexico and Canada to host the FIFA World Cup, the games in the US will begin with the hosts taking on Paraguay in a Group D match in Los Angeles on June 12, day after the tournament kicks off in Mexico City. That will set football (soccer for Americans) rolling across 11 cities for the next one month. The Americans, who put American football, baseball and basketball, above the world’s most popular sport are keen to make it the biggest ever spectacle for the millions of fans offering them an unbelievable time.“From New York to Miami to LA and Seattle, it’s quite a diverse list of host cities. I think each of the host cities are excited to put on a great show, and really engage their communities because it is very much about the communities that are hosting as well.The fan fests are going to be a great way to go beyond the stadium into the community. Local food, culture, music, and engaging with local communities as well. It’s hard to describe how exciting it’s going to be. I think it's going to be beyond any of our expectations,” Fred Dixon, president and CEO of Brand USA, told TOI in an exclusive interview.Speaking on the sidelines of the Brand USA Travel Week India held here, Dixon said the authorities also plan to make it easy for the spectators to get the US visa. “If you decide to buy tickets to the World Cup and you don’t have your visa yet, there actually is a way to facilitate that process to identify yourself as a ticket holder, and then the State Department will work to facilitate the visa processing faster for those travelers,” Dixon said.Dixon was particularly excited to welcome the Indians travelling for the World Cup. “In places like New Jersey and New York, places like Atlanta and Dallas, Texas, those are obviously big communities. The communities will come to life through the fan fests and so there will be the official fan fest events for every host city. So you'll be in the communities with the locals or with your friends and the people you're traveling with. With more than 5 million Indians living in the US, seeking out and traveling with or spending time with family and friends will be a big component of that,” Dixon said.On whether there will be any relaxation for the fans from Haiti and Iran, Dixon didn’t have an answer. “You’d have to check with the State Department,” he said.For those millions who get entry into the US and the special ones who get lucky through the draw, FIFA said there were 500 million requests for tickets to watch the matches, the US wanted to wow them. On top of the list are the road trips including the iconic Route 66.“It’s a unique moment as well because it’s the 250th anniversary of America. So you have America, 250 activities happening all across the country as well. The other anniversary that’s happening this year is Route 66. It's the 100th anniversary of the famous highway (opened on Nov 11, 1926) that connects California and Chicago -- from Chicago to Santa Monica. It winds through small, interesting towns all across the west of the US. And so you’re going to see a lot of themes around road trips, that freedom of the open road in America. So I think there will be a lot of curated experiences around road trips,” said Dixon.“In the host cities themselves, you’re going to have lots of curated experiences, whether it relates to museums, art, exhibitions. The travelers are going to benefit from the focus on a lot of Americana, both historical, but also what American brands, I think, have meant to the world. The Fleet Week, which is one of the big celebrations in New York every year in the harbour, has been moved from what is normally in late May. It’s now moving to July 4th. So just imagine the Statue of Liberty with fireworks and all the Navy fleets, you know. It’s expected to have the largest gathering of tall ships in the world for America 250, which will travel up the east coast of the US. So there is an unlimited amount of curated experiences to have,” Dixon added.“At americathebeautiful.com , we actually have AI integration to help with trip inspiration, particularly when you are dealing with an event that is multi-city, multi-date. We know what the group schedule will be, but as teams advance beyond the group, who’s going to the quarterfinals, who’s going to the semifinals, how would you route yourself? The itineraries may be dynamic if you’re following a particular team. And so our new website has an AI component built into it to help with itinerary suggestions and plannings and ideas.“You also can integrate what your passion points are. So if it’s culture, if it’s history and food, it will help give you highlights and ideas for how you can route yourself. It’s not a booking platform, but it's an inspiration platform. We’ve used AI in a way to help tap into really what is the best of America, and then to inspire travelers to travel, you know, far and to travel deep when they're in the US to explore the World cup, specifically,” Dixon signed off.","The US joins Mexico and Canada to host the FIFA World Cup.

Jay Shah’s 2036 Olympic blueprint for India: '8 Medals won’t cut it'

NEW DELHI/KOLKATA: Former India and East Bengal defender Ilyas Pasha died on Thursday after a prolonged illness.He was 61. He is survived by his wife, two daughters, and two sons.The All India Football Federation (AIFF) condoled the death of Pasha, who was one of the best footballers to have come out of Karnataka.A committed and soft-spoken footballer, Pasha carved out a distinguished career in an area of the field that demanded resilience and composure - defence.Primarily operating as a right wing-back, he was renowned for his impeccable sense of timing, calm demeanour, and ability to read the game astutely.Rarely flustered under pressure, Pasha's disciplined positioning and well-judged tackles ensured that opposing left wingers found little joy on his flank, while goalkeepers behind him operated with added confidence.At the international level, Pasha made his senior India debut on January 27, 1987, against Bulgaria in the Nehru Cup at Kozhikode.He went on to earn eight international caps, featuring in two editions of the Nehru Cup (1987 and 1991), the 1991 SAF Games, and the 1992 Asian Cup qualifiers.Pasha began his football journey with Vinayaka Football Club, Vyalikaval, in north Bengaluru, where he also resided.His consistent performances soon earned him a move to Indian Telephone Industries in the mid-1980s, a period that marked his emergence at the national level.From 1987 onwards, he became a regular feature for Karnataka in the Santosh Trophy , representing the state at the tournaments held in Kolkata in 1987, Quilon (now Kollam) in 1988, and Guwahati in 1989.His performance in Guwahati stood out, as Karnataka narrowly missed out on a final berth. He also won two Santosh Trophy titles with Bengal in 1993 and 1995.On the back of his domestic exploits, Pasha was signed by Mohammedan Sporting, where he continued to enhance his reputation, winning the Sait Nagjee Trophy and the Nizam Gold Cup in 1989.He later joined East Bengal, a move that ushered in the most defining phase of his club career. Representing the iconic red and gold from the early 1990s through the end of the decade, Pasha became an integral part of one of the club's most successful eras.He captained East Bengal during the 1993-94 season and was a trusted figure under the late coach Subhas Bhowmick.With the Red and Gold Brigade, he won the Calcutta Football League on five occasions (1991, 1993, 1995, 1996 and 1998), the IFA Shield five times (1990, 1991, 1994, 1995 and 1997), and the Durand Cup four times (1990, 1991, 1993 and 1995).His trophy cabinet also included two Rovers Cups (1990, 1994), the Federation Cup (1996), the historic Wai Wai Cup in Kathmandu (1993), Airlines Trophy titles in 1990, 1992, 1995 and 1997, the Bordoloi Trophy (1992), ATPA Shield (1992), Kalinga Cup (1993), McDowell Trophy (1995, 1997), and the Super Cup in the 1996-97 season.He was also a member of East Bengal's celebrated triple crown-winning side in 1990 and captained the team to its first international title at the Wai Wai Cup in 1993.He also wore the captain's armband when East Bengal registered a sensational 6-2 victory over Iraq's Al Zawraa SC in the 1993-94 Asian Cup Winners' Cup.He got a special Lifetime Achievement Award from East Bengal in 2012.The AIFF said it has joined the Indian football fraternity in mourning the loss of Pasha, a defender of rare composure and consistency, to honour his lasting contributions to the game.In Kolkata, the East Bengal flag was kept at half-mast on the day, while the club's Under-16 team observed a minute's silence before training.Former East Bengal skipper Falguni Dutta, who played alongside Pasha for two years, remembered him fondly. ""I came to know early in the morning. I was shocked.""When I came to the club in 1997, I was a raw talent and he was there to guide me as a mentor. He played in the same position as me, but I never saw any jealousy in him. He was like an elder brother -- a guide and a coach. He inspired us,"" Dutta said.East Bengal Club bid a final farewell to Pasha at his Bengaluru residence.Working committee member Dipten Bose paid his respects, while former players Saravanan, Thomas and Feroz were also present.","Former India and East Bengal defender Ilyas Pasha dies at 61. Pasha was renowned for his impeccable sense of timing, calm demeanour, and ability to read the game astutely.

Time for recalibration

What does the current RFP say?

Poll What is your opinion on the AIFF's decision to issue a second Request for Proposal for ISL broadcast rights? It's a necessary step for improvement It shows a lack of planning It's too late to make a difference I have no opinion on this

Last week, the All India Football Federation (AIFF) floated a Request for Proposal (RFP) tender looking for a broadcast partner for the 2025-26 Indian Super League (ISL) season. This was the second time in six months that the AIFF had issued such a document as the first version, released in October 2025, demanded an annual minimum guarantee of Rs 37.5 crore. For a variety of reasons, that didn't find any takers.Ever since, Indian football is in a free fall.AIFF's deal with Football Sports Development Limited (FSDL), which had started the ISL in 2014, expired on December 8, 2025. Between AIFF Constitutional changes, court visits, lack of commercial partners and eventual intervention by the Sports Ministry, ISL has taken a massive hit to its credibility, even if it now has a start date in February 14.The fixtures for ISL 2025-26, which have been tucked away in the draft folder for days due to home venues being in shambles, add to the challenge for any prospective broadcast bidder(s).With 91 matches to be played in the upcoming truncated season in a single leg home-and-away format, this race against time only gets trickier with each passing day. The fact that AIFF have not officially appointed an agency to oversee the broadcast bids process doesn't bode well either.In 2021, the BCCI brought in audit, tax and financial advisory consultants KPMG to advise them on the media rights sale for the IPL. The objective was clear: earn 'top dollar.' It resulted in media rights for the IPL going at Rs 48,390.32 crore over five years - a 100 percent jump in value per match.AIFF, which has hardly showcased its competence in the past few months, is alone in this regard. Before FSDL stepped away, the ISL had a broadcast deal worth Rs 550 crore over two seasons with games showcased on linear TV and OTT. At first, ISL matches were broadcast on the Star Sports Network before moving to the Viacom18-owned Sports18/JioCinema.The Rs 275 crore-a-year deal was reportedly a 37.5 percent increase on what Star India, who had a majority stake in the ISL, had been paying in the first 10 years of the competition.This Rs 275 crore funded things such as match production, league marketing, revenue for the clubs and fixed payments to the federation. Despite this, FSDL posted losses of Rs 14.34 crore in FY23, Rs 46.3 crore in FY22, Rs 13.7 crore in FY21 and Rs 27 crore in FY20. The league only turned profitable when operations were scaled down, posting a net profit of Rs 45.2 crore in FY24.Now, in this post-FSDL era, AIFF and, by extension, the ISL clubs have little room to negotiate with any potential bidders. With the ISL set to be played in multiple cities, it adds to the costs involved with only Rs 9.77 crore budgeted for Production and Transmission. In the past, it hovered around Rs 70 crores.It means the quality output of the broadcast will be lower. Instead of multi-camera setups in different parts of the ground, one can expect 3-4 cameras, similar to the I-League coverage where equipment is placed at a high vantage point, behind the goal and near the half-way line.An ISL club official, who spoke to TimesofIndia.com on the condition of anonymity, said that organising the league in multiple cities could dissuade potential bidders. He also reminded that options are limited anyway, as February-March is also the period for the T20 World Cup in India and Sri Lanka, which JioStar will broadcast.The logic is simple: higher viewership means higher sponsorship for clubs and with an inferior product, that Rs 5-6 crore piece of the puzzle is going to take a hit. All clubs are braced for another year of red in their balance sheet. Even though many will cut costs operationally and have reduced player wages, the losses are expected to be three times the normal in the absence of commercial revenue.Like other aspects of the ISL including franchise fees and player salaries, the broadcast rights value also needs to be recalibrated for a healthier future. While this upcoming season can largely be logged as a stop-gap solution-finding exercise, the exercise towards an economically viable product needs to begin now. As ICC and BCCI have found out, mindless pricing of broadcast deals will drive away smaller players in the streaming space. And unlike sports like cricket and kabaddi - whose audience still consumes coverage on linear TV - football's young viewership exists on OTT.Subsequently, if players stay away due to pricing, it will further dwindle AIFF's options. Among the major broadcast players - on linear TV and digital - there are few options outside of JioStar and Sony Sports Network.AIFF's RFP for media rights of the ISL is a 39-page document that lays down the detailed eligibility framework for prospective bidders and specifies the timelines for bids to be submitted, examined and assessed.As per the schedule, the AIFF has fixed January 23 for a pre-bid meeting with interested parties, while any written queries or requests for clarification may be addressed by up to January 27.Bids must be submitted no later than 5:00 pm IST on February 1, with each submission accompanied by a security deposit of Rs. 5 lakh.Eligibility conditions require bidders to be broadcasters or internet operators with a minimum of three years’ operational experience.In addition, bidders must have recorded a net worth of at least Rs. 10 crore in the most recent financial year (2024–25) and an average annual revenue of no less than Rs. 10 crore across the last three completed financial years — 2022–23, 2023–24 and 2024–25.In the case of consortium bids, a maximum of three entities may come together under a special purpose vehicle (SPV). One member must be designated as the ‘Lead member’ and hold at least a 51 percent equity stake in the SPV’s paid-up and subscribed share capital.Each bid will be evaluated in two components — Technical and Financial — carrying weightages of 70 percent and 30 percent respectively. The bidder securing the highest overall score will be awarded the rights for the forthcoming season.","The All India Football Federation (AIFF) floated a Request for Proposal (RFP) tender looking for a broadcast partner for the 2025-26 Indian Super League (ISL) season.

Patrick Mahomes Injury Update: Clark Hunt confirms rehab push as QB signals comeback,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/patrick-mahomes-injury-update-clark-hunt-confirms-rehab-push-as-qb-signals-comeback/articleshow/127752353.cms,"Patrick Mahomes injury update (via Getty Images)

Clark Hunt confirms rehab push as Patrick Mahomes targets Week 1



January has always been Patrick Mahomes ’ season. It is when his teams usually fight for Super Bowls, and Kansas City remains in the playoff picture. This year, the noise is gone, the stadium lights are off, and Mahomes is spending his winter inside a rehab room instead of an AFC title chase.Still, he found a way to speak. On January 29, 2026, Mahomes posted a photo on Instagram wearing his Chiefs jersey with a single clock emoji. The message felt quiet but intentional, especially because it arrived just two days after Chiefs owner Clark Hunt publicly confirmed that the quarterback is pushing to return for Week 1. Together, the timing created a clear picture. Mahomes is not easing his way back. He is chasing a deadline.The journey started on Dec. 14, 2025, when Mahomes tore his ACL late in the fourth quarter against the L.A. Chargers in Week 15. The injury shocked the stadium and ended his season in an instant. He underwent surgery the very next day, beginning a recovery process that immediately reshaped the Chiefs’ future.The morning after the operation, Mahomes addressed fans on X. On December 15, he wrote that he did not understand why the injury happened but promised to trust the process and work every day to return stronger.At that point, Kansas City still believed it could survive. The following weeks proved otherwise.Without their quarterback, the Chiefs lost their final three games. The defeats extended a collapse that finished as a six-game losing streak, pushing Kansas City out of the playoff race for the first time in the Mahomes era. The offense stalled, the locker room lost direction, and ownership was forced to confront how fragile the roster looked without its leader.That reality drove change. During the offseason reset, Kansas City rehired Eric Bieniemy as offensive coordinator for 2026, bringing back a familiar voice to help stabilise a unit that had unravelled late in the year. The move reflected urgency from the top to rebuild around Mahomes before his return.Two weeks later, clarity arrived from the owner himself. On Jan. 27, 2026, Clark Hunt appeared on “Good Morning Football"" on NFL Network and shared what he witnessed inside the team facility.“I was with Patrick a couple of days ago in our training room, watching him go through the work he’s doing to get back on the field,” Hunt said during the interview. “Nobody works harder than Patrick.”Hunt then confirmed the target. “He certainly has a goal to be back for the beginning of the season,” he added on the same show.Chiefs vice president of sports medicine Rick Burkholder said on December 17 that Mahomes’ recovery is expected to take about nine months, placing him close to the 2026 opener. He explained that timelines can shift depending on healing and progress in football movement.Before the injury, the star QB played 14 games in 2025, throwing for 3,587 yards, 22 touchdowns, and 11 interceptions, with an 89.6 passer rating, the lowest of his career. Now the signals match. The rehab. The roster reset. The owner’s words. And finally, the clock emoji. Patrick Mahomes is counting down. Kansas City is building toward it.","Patrick Mahomes tore his ACL against the L.A. Chargers on Dec. 14, 2025. He underwent surgery the very next day, beginning a recovery process.

Texans fire three coaches after playoff collapse as C.J. Stroud’s future suddenly feels uncertain,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/texans-fire-three-coaches-after-playoff-collapse-as-c-j-strouds-future-suddenly-feels-uncertain/articleshow/127750851.cms,"Texans fire three coaches after playoff collapse as C.J. Stroud’s future suddenly feels uncertaininy



Houston sends a message as Stroud’s playoff struggles redefine the offseason.

The Houston Texans did not just walk off the field in Foxborough defeated. They walked off exposed. What looked like a breakthrough season ended with the same cold truth. Houston still cannot win when the moment gets heavy.Inside the building, the mood changed fast. There was no patience. There was no spin. The franchise made it clear this loss would not fade into the offseason. It would reshape it. And three days later, the first moves came.On January 28, 2026, KPRC2 NFL reporter Aaron Wilson reported on X that Houston dismissed tight ends coach Jake Moreland, assistant linebackers coach Ben Bolling, and offensive assistant Mike Snyder.“Texans move on from tight ends coach Jake Moreland, per league sources, assistant linebackers coach Ben Bolling, offensive assistant Mike Snyder,” Wilson wrote while posting his update.The timing was no coincidence. The firings followed a 28–16 divisional-round loss to the New England Patriots on Jan. 25, 2026. It marked Houston’s third straight road exit in the same round under DeMeco Ryans. Houston arrived in New England riding a nine-game winning streak.The defense ranked among the league’s elite. The Texans had just crushed Pittsburgh 30–6 in the wild-card round. Everything pointed forward. Then the offense imploded. C.J. Stroud completed 20 of 47 passes. He threw four interceptions in the first half and finished with five turnovers by the offense. Houston trailed 21–10 at halftime and never regained control.General manager Nick Caserio spoke during his season-ending press conference on Jan. 24, 2026. “You can’t turn the ball over five times in the divisional round,” Caserio said. “Taking care of the football is the single most important stat correlated to winning.”The pattern is now undeniable. Under Ryans, Houston averages 13.3 points in divisional-round games and allows 28. Stroud owns a QBR of 41, ranking 12th of 14 quarterbacks in those games. He has thrown one touchdown to four interceptions, completed 53.7%, and averages 5.9 yards per attempt.Yet in the wild-card round, Houston looks unstoppable. The Texans average 31 points, 418.5 total yards, and allow just nine points. The defense has scored five touchdowns in those games. HC DeMeco Ryans addressed the collapse after the Patriots' loss on Jan. 25, 2026, at Gillette Stadium.“If you don’t execute in the moment, if you don’t protect the football, that’s not going to win you football games,” he said.Stroud finished the 2025 regular season with 3,041 passing yards, down from over 4,000 as a rookie.

Supporting Bill Belichick through career change and controversy

Legendary NFL coach Bill Belichick has spent decades in the spotlight for his football brilliance. But in recent years, his personal life has drawn just as much attention. Belichick, who is 73-years-old now is in a relationship with Jordon Hudson, a 24-year-old former cheerleader and model. Their 48-year age gap and public appearances have made headlines, especially as Belichick navigates a major career shift and a surprising Hall of Fame snub.Here’s a clear timeline of how their relationship began and evolved.Bill Belichick and Jordon Hudson first met in February 2021 during a flight from the Boston area to Florida. At the time, Hudson was a college student and competitive cheerleader. According to reports, they were seated next to each other and struck up a conversation about academics. Belichick even signed one of Hudson’s textbooks , Deductive Knowledge, writing a note that read: “Thanks for giving me a course in logic!” The interaction seemed casual, and there was no public indication of a relationship at that stage.Belichick and Hudson met in 2021, but they didn't start dating until early 2023. People instantly started to wonder what was going on when they saw the two of them walking together in New Orleans' French Quarter.Later that year, they were seen having dinner together again.They kept their outings low-key, but they were regular enough to keep speculations about their relationship going.In June 2024, sources confirmed that Belichick and Hudson were dating. Hudson quickly responded to criticism of their age difference on social media, defending their relationship and calling out what she called ""keyboard warriors.""The duo made their red carpet debut together at a high-profile charity event in New York City in December 2024. This was their first official public appearance as a couple.In 2025, Belichick made news again when he became the head football coach at the University of North Carolina. He had been with the New England Patriots for more than 20 years before that. Hudson was often spotted at games and events supporting him as he made the switch to collegiate football.In January 2026, their friendship was back in the news after Belichick was shockingly left out of the Pro Football Hall of Fame in his first year of eligibility. The choice caused a lot of talk, with responses coming from past players, experts, and even politicians. Hudson vocally backed Belichick during the incident, even though people were watching him closely.From a chance meeting on a flight to becoming one of football’s most talked-about couples, Bill Belichick and Jordon Hudson’s relationship has unfolded under intense public interest. While opinions remain divided, the couple has continued to stand by each other as Belichick faces both professional transition and historic debate around his legacy.","Bill Belichick and Jordon Hudson met on a flight in February 2021.

What is Antonio Brown accused of?

Recent court update on Antonio Brown’s case

Antonio Brown's Attorney Wants DNA Ahead of Stand Your Ground Hearing

Former NFL wide receiver Antonio Brown is once again in the headlines, but this time for serious legal trouble. The 37-year-old ex-Pittsburgh Steelers star is currently facing a second-degree attempted murder charge linked to a shooting incident in Miami. Here is a clear breakdown of what has happened so far and where the case stands as of January, 2026.The case is based on something that happened on May 16, 2025, outside a celebrity boxing match in Miami. Police and court records say that Brown got into a confrontation with a man named Zul-Qarnain Kwame Nantambu.Prosecutors allege that after the fistfight ended, Brown chased Nantambu and fired two gunshots at him. One of the bullets reportedly grazed Nantambu’s neck. Surveillance footage and social media videos allegedly show Brown holding a firearm at the scene. He has pleaded not guilty to the charge.Brown’s legal team has pushed back strongly against the accusations. His attorney argues that Brown acted in self-defense and has filed a motion seeking dismissal of the case under Florida’s “Stand Your Ground” law.According to the defense, Brown believed he was in immediate danger and fired what they describe as “warning shots,” intentionally aiming away from the alleged victim.The motion also claims Nantambu had a history of aggressive behavior toward Brown, including a prior incident overseas.However the prosecutors dispute this version of events, stating that video evidence shows Nantambu walking away before Brown allegedly chased and shot at him.Brown was arrested in November 2025 after returning to the United States from Dubai, where he had spent several months following the incident. He was released from a Miami jail on $25,000 bail after pleading not guilty.As part of his release conditions, he was placed under house arrest and ordered to wear a GPS ankle monitor. At first, prosecutors said he was a flight risk since he had traveled abroad before. In January 2026, he got permission from the court to go to Tampa for a short while, even though the case was still going on. The judge let the travel happen for work reasons, such as scheduled business meetings and recording studio sessions.He could take off his ankle monitor while he was on vacation, but he had to put it back on when he got back to Miami. His lawyers are also waiting for DNA evidence from a holster found at the scene, which they think could back up his claim of self-defense.As of now Brown is still awaiting a key hearing related to his Stand Your Ground motion. The next hearing is on February 25th at 9:00 AM. If the judge accepts the defense argument, the charge could be dismissed. If not, the case will proceed toward trial.If convicted, he could face up to 15 years in prison and a significant fine. Until then, the former NFL star remains under strict supervision as one of the most high-profile legal cases involving a former football player continues to unfold.","Antonio Brown is facing a second-degree attempted murder charge linked to a shooting incident in Miami.

Travis Kelce’s future takes spotlight as Eric Bieniemy opens up on reunion talks after Chiefs return,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/travis-kelces-future-takes-spotlight-as-eric-bieniemy-opens-up-on-reunion-talks-after-chiefs-return/articleshow/127748495.cms,"Eric Bieniemy opens up on private talks with Patrick Mahomes and Travis Kelce (Getty Images)

Travis Kelce retirement rumors gain new life after Eric Bieniemy return



Travis Kelce retirement rumors sit at the heart of Kansas City’s uneasy offseason, and the silence from the star tight end only deepens the intrigue. After 13 demanding seasons in red and gold, Kelce has earned the right to step away on his own terms. Yet the Chiefs are a franchise searching for direction after a rare down year, and his choice now carries weight far beyond one roster spot.The timing makes the decision even more delicate. Kansas City stumbled to a 6–11 finish and missed the playoffs for the first time since 2014. The offense lacked its usual bite, the crowd sensed change, and the locker room felt the strain of transition. In that context, Kelce’s future feels less like personal closure and more like a pivot point for the entire organization.Hope resurfaced quickly when the Chiefs brought back Eric Bieniemy as offensive coordinator. His earlier run from 2018 to 2022 delivered structure, pace, and two Super Bowl rings. For veterans like Kelce, familiarity matters. Rhythm matters. Trust matters. Bieniemy’s presence signals a return to standards that once defined Kansas City football.At his introductory press conference, Bieniemy addressed his reconnecting conversations with Patrick Mahomes and Kelce.He kept it light, personal, and revealing without trying to sell a storyline.“I’ve had just a small minimum conversation with both, and they all have been great,” Bieniemy said. “More than anything, it’s just the excitement of reuniting. ... I’m looking forward to getting back in the grind and chopping wood with them.”That single word, reuniting, landed loudly among Chiefs fans. It sounded like continuity. It sounded like unfinished business. While Bieniemy likely spoke about the broader group rather than one player’s decision, the comment still cracked the door open. A return for at least the 2026 season suddenly feels possible.The optimism aligns with leadership at the top. Chiefs CEO Clark Hunt publicly shared his hope that Kelce plays another year. It was a measured statement, not pressure, but it showed how valued the tight end remains inside the building.Challenges remain. Mahomes continues his recovery from a season ending knee injury. The offense ranked middle or worse in most major categories. Bieniemy brings clarity, but rebuilding momentum takes time. Kelce now weighs loyalty, health, and legacy. Whatever he chooses will echo well beyond one offseason.",Travis Kelce has not commented on his future with the Kansas City Chiefs. Eric Bieniemy opened up about reuniting with Kelce and Patrick Mahomes. Chiefs CEO Clark Hunt has said he hopes Kelce plays another year.

Sean McDermott’s surprising decision to pass on Buccaneers role hints at bigger plans after Bills departure,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/sean-mcdermotts-surprising-decision-to-pass-on-buccaneers-role-hints-at-bigger-plans-after-bills-departure/articleshow/127746959.cms,"Sean McDermott turns down Buccaneers offer (Imagn Images)

Sean McDermott chooses patience over quick return



Sean McDermott entered a rare pause in an NFL career built on urgency, results, and constant pressure. Buffalo’s decision to move on from its long-time head coach on Jan. 19 closed a nine-season chapter defined by consistency but also by unmet Super Bowl expectations. The Bills believed the roster needed a new voice, even if it meant parting with one of the league’s most respected leaders.The timing surprised many across the league. The coaching market moved fast, and McDermott’s name did not circulate the way most expected. Some teams were already deep into their searches. Others may have sensed that McDermott was not eager to jump into the wrong situation. What followed suggested intention rather than rejection.Sean McDermott did receive interest. Tampa Bay quietly explored the idea of adding him to Todd Bowles’ staff, a move that would have reunited McDermott with familiar faces and a respected defensive mind. The outreach was real, but so was McDermott’s response. He chose distance over convenience.“Bucs talked to ex-Bills coach Sean McDermott to check about joining Todd Bowles’ staff, but he’s expected to take this year off and re-assess his options in 2027,” Auman wrote on X.“He overlapped with Jason Licht with Eagles 2003-07 and interviewed for Bucs’ HC job in 2016.”That decision mirrors a growing trend among elite coaches. Instead of rushing back into a high-pressure role, McDermott appears focused on recalibration. The path taken by Mike Vrabel offers a clear blueprint. After his exit from Tennessee, Vrabel resisted immediate head coaching roles and instead joined Cleveland in a consulting capacity. That patience paid off when New England handed him the keys again, a move that now has the Patriots one win away from a Super Bowl title.McDermott’s resume speaks loudly. A 98–50 record in Buffalo, playoff regularity, and a reputation for building disciplined teams ensure his phone will ring again. When it does, the circumstances may be better aligned. A playoff-ready roster. A clear vision. Real authority.Meanwhile, Buffalo has turned the page with Joe Brady, elevating a familiar voice to lead the next phase. If McDermott returns next season, an AFC reunion is possible. The idea of McDermott and Brady crossing paths in January football carries intrigue. Sometimes, stepping away is the move that sets up the breakthrough.","Sean McDermott chose distance over convenience. Tampa Bay quietly explored the idea of adding him to Todd Bowles’ staff.

Todd Monken's wife Terri Monken and the life built around football



Todd Monken accepted the Cleveland Browns head coaching job and his wife Terri Monken stepped quietly into the spotlight after. While speculation once linked him to New York, his move to Cleveland shifted attention closer to home. Fans now want to understand the woman who has walked beside a coach whose career has spanned more than three decades, countless locker rooms, and constant change.Behind the playbooks and packed stadiums is a marriage shaped by movement, patience, and shared belief. Todd Monken’s offensive success with Lamar Jackson in Baltimore and his championship years at Georgia are well known. Less visible is the steady presence of Terri Monken, whose life has been woven into football without being defined by it. Her story adds human depth to a coach often described only by schemes and results.Terri Monken understands the game, sometimes in ways that cut through complexity. Todd once shared her blunt wisdom in 2024, saying, “Like my wife says, ‘I don’t know why you don’t just call the plays that work. It just seems that simple. Why would you call anything but plays that work?’” It is a line that captures her mix of humor and clarity, and it reflects a household where football talk never really stops.Their story began unexpectedly at a funeral while both attended the College of DuPage in Glen Ellyn, Illinois. Todd played baseball. Terri was a pom-pom girl. Grief brought them into the same space, and conversation revealed an instant connection. Todd later joked about being the “original funeral crasher,” while Terri quickly sensed his deep bond with the sport. “Oh, probably within the first few minutes of talking to him,” Terri said. “It’s in his DNA. You just always know there’s three people in the room: you, him, and football.”They dated for six years before marrying in 1991, learning early how to adapt. Coaching meant constant relocation, a rhythm Terri came to accept. “You get used to the smell of cardboard,” she said. “I don’t think Todd’s got ‘settle’ in his bones. He loves to chase the opportunity. And every step, for the most part, has been a phenomenal move.”Away from football, Terri built her own path. She worked as a health insurance plan administrator and stayed active, even running the 50th New York City Marathon in 2021. Together, they raised one son, Travis, who entered football himself and understands the grind firsthand. “It’s crazy how much time he puts into it,” Travis said. “He’s kept his juice. He loves it out there.”Terri sums up their life best. “Work is always there,” she said. “I don’t want to say obsessed, but he’s all-in.” In Cleveland, that all-in commitment continues, backed by a partner who has seen every chapter.","Todd Monken accepted the Cleveland Browns head coaching job and his wife Terri Monken stepped quietly into the spotlight.

“No one wants the drama”: Jordon Hudson is the reason NFL teams are backing away from Bill Belichick,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/no-one-wants-the-drama-jordon-hudson-is-the-reason-nfl-teams-are-backing-away-from-bill-belichick/articleshow/127741685.cms,"Bill Belichick remains without an NFL job as teams grow wary of off-field distractions. Reports suggest the Buffalo Bills and others have distanced themselves, with growing focus on Belichick’s relationship with Jordon Hudson. Despite his six Super Bowl titles, league decision-makers now prioritize stability, viewing Belichick as a risky hire in a changing NFL landscape.

Why Buffalo and others are backing away from Bill Belichick

Bill Belichick’s name once carried automatic authority across NFL front offices. Now, it sparks hesitation. As teams reshuffle leadership after another playoff cycle, the six-time Super Bowl winner remains on the outside looking in. The latest signal came from Buffalo, where the Bills quietly drew a line that speaks volumes about how the league views Belichick in 2026.Around the NFL, perception matters as much as pedigree. Executives are no longer weighing only past rings. They are assessing optics, stability, and distraction risk. For Belichick, critics argue that his personal life has altered how teams judge his fit. What once looked like unmatched control now appears, to some, like uncertainty.According to reporting that circulated this week, the Buffalo Bills are not pursuing Belichick despite entering a full coaching reset. Mike Florio explained the thinking bluntly. “Per a source with knowledge of the situation,” Mike Florio said. “The Buffalo Bills are not interested in Bill Belichick. At one level, it's surprising.""""If the Bills are going to interview someone like Philip Rivers for the job, why not kick the tires on the Tar Heels head coach? At a not-much-deeper level, Belichick has morphed from GOAT in a good way to goat in the usual sense.""That shift in reputation has fueled harsh fan reaction as well. One comment spreading online captured the mood. “Belichick has become the new Kaepernick of the NFL. No one wants the drama from a mediocre talent,” one fan said.Buffalo’s decision came shortly after parting ways with Sean McDermott, ending a nine-year run that brought five straight AFC East titles and consistent playoff appearances. In his farewell, McDermott focused on gratitude and community.“For nearly a decade I have had the opportunity to wake up every morning as the Head Coach of the Buffalo Bills, which has truly been a gift,” McDermott said in his statement to Tom Pelissero.“I want to express my sincere gratitude and appreciation to the Pegula family, the Buffalo Bills organization, and to the fans for allowing me to live out the dream of being a Head Coach in the NFL in this incredibly special place.“I am proud and humbled to have worked alongside amazing staff and players as we shared life together and poured out our hearts and souls into both winning football games and making a positive impact in our community.“This community graciously embraced not only me but my family and in some ways helped raise our children over the last 9 years. For that I say thank you to all of the teachers, coaches, and friends whom we met along the way...the City of Good Neighbors! We Love You! We will miss Buffalo.”As Buffalo explores a possible reunion with Brian Daboll, the league’s message grows louder. Familiar leadership feels safer than controversy. For the first time, Bill Belichick’s legacy alone is not enough.",Buffalo Bills are reportedly not interested in hiring Bill Belichick.

Drake Maye’s wife Ann blends comfort and confidence in pre-Super Bowl moment that fans can’t stop sharing



Drake Maye and his Super Bowl dreams are turning real as New England prepares for football’s biggest night under California skies. The second year quarterback has carried the Patriots through a season defined by grit, cold weather wins, and quiet confidence. With Santa Clara on the horizon, the story is no longer just about schemes and stats. It is about belief, timing, and a new face leading a historic franchise back where it believes it belongs.Snow still clung to Denver turf when Maye shared a brief, emotional moment with his wife Ann Michael after a bruising 10-7 victory. It summed up the journey. Tough yards. Few words. Full commitment. New England did not arrive here with style points. It arrived with resolve, and that has become the signature of Maye’s rise.Maye’s performance this season speaks loudly without trying to impress. He threw for 4,394 yards with 31 touchdowns and just eight interceptions. When plays broke down, he used his legs, including a crucial 65 rushing yards in that Denver win. He did what the moment asked. Nothing more. Nothing less. That approach has placed him firmly in the NFL MVP conversation, an extraordinary leap for a quarterback still early in his career.The challenge ahead carries history with it. Maye is chasing something no Patriots quarterback has done since Tom Brady. Brady last lifted the Lombardi Trophy for New England in 2019 and did it six times overall. Now retired and calling games from the Fox Sports booth, Brady’s shadow still looms. Maye is not trying to outrun it. He is building his own path straight through it.Off the field, Ann Michael has become part of the playoff narrative in her own way. Her TikTok cooking clips and bold game day outfits have drawn attention without forcing it. From sparkly pants to custom jackets, she has brought personality to the Patriots postseason run. Even a simple cold morning walk in Boston turned into a viral moment, pajamas and all. With Santa Clara offering warm sunshine, that winter edge finally gives way to comfort.New England’s return to the Super Bowl marks its 12th appearance, the most in league history. Their last trip came in the 2018 playoffs, ending with a 13-3 win over the Rams. That remains the lowest scoring Super Bowl ever. Fittingly, defense and discipline carried the day then. Those same traits now ride with Maye into Super Bowl LX.","Drake Maye's wife Ann blends comfort and confidence in pre-Super Bowl moment that fans can’t stop sharing.

Leanna Lenee’s quiet update reveals the toughest chapter of the Hunter family’s year

Travis Hunter’s life has moved at full speed since he entered the NFL , but the most personal battles this season have unfolded far from the field. While the Jaguars rookie continues his rehab journey after a devastating knee injury, his wife Leanna Lenee is navigating recovery of her own following pregnancy. This week, she quietly reminded fans that strength does not always come from spotlight moments.Leanna has posted an open Instagram story of her home gym, which provides a unique insight into how she manages motherhood and self-care. It was not an advertisement. It was raw and intentional. Wearing gym clothes and standing in front of the mirror, she was able to capture the moment that conveyed the message of discipline, healing, and resilience. Her message was simple but powerful. “Never miss an AM workout.”The Hunters shocked fans in August when they revealed they had already welcomed their first child. The announcement came after months of privacy, made more meaningful by the fact that their newborn son spent time in the NICU before coming home. Rather than share updates in fragments, the couple chose a deeper approach.They released a three-minute YouTube video titled “Dear Son…,” offering an intimate look at moments they had kept close.The video includes reactions to a positive pregnancy test, ultrasound images, and delivery room scenes. The emotional core arrives at the end with their son’s birth. In one tender moment, Hunter says, “That baby looks just like me,” before turning to his wife and adding, “You did good, baby.”Off the field, the couple married in May and relocated to Florida as Hunter began his professional career. On the field, the season took a harsh turn. Hunter suffered a season-ending knee injury during practice in October and underwent surgery on November 11 to repair his LCL. Doctors reported no structural damage, keeping hope alive for a full return by the start of the 2026 season.As Travis works toward reclaiming his rare two-way role, Leanna’s quiet fitness update shows another side of the story. Recovery is not always loud. Sometimes, it begins before sunrise.","Leanna Lenee shared a quiet health update as she continues recovering after welcoming her son.

“These two are WORSE than Travis Kelce & Taylor Swift”: Drake Maye faces backlash over postgame interaction with his wife Anne Michael,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/these-two-are-worse-than-travis-kelce-taylor-swift-drake-maye-faces-backlash-over-postgame-interaction-with-his-wife-anne-michael/articleshow/127706861.cms,"Drake Maye helped lead the Patriots back to the Super Bowl, but his quiet postgame interaction with his wife drew unexpected attention. Fans questioned his body language after cameras showed a subdued celebration following the AFC Championship win. While some criticized the moment as awkward, others suggested the quarterback was simply focused and saving the emotion for the Super Bowl ahead.

Drake Maye’s celebration style sparks unexpected fan backlash

Drake Maye should have been wrapped in a moment of pure celebration. The New England Patriots had just punched their ticket to the Super Bowl , ending a long wait for fans still chasing the glow of the Brady and Belichick years. The stadium buzzed. Cameras rolled. History was made. Yet one brief postgame clip shifted the conversation in an unexpected direction.As confetti fell and emotions ran high, Maye’s on-field interaction with his wife, Anne Michael Maye, quickly went viral. Not because of a grand embrace or a tearful kiss, but because many viewers felt something was missing. Social media latched onto his reserved demeanor, turning a fleeting moment into a full-blown debate about body language, pressure, and public expectations placed on athletes.The 22-year-old quarterback, now the face of a new era for the Patriots, had just helped guide his team to a narrow 10-7 win over Denver. Speaking afterward, Drake Maye struck a thoughtful tone about what the moment meant. “Yes, like I said, the history and everything about it, it’s a new team, it’s a new era,” he said.“I respect and appreciate what the Patriots dynasty did, and unfortunately, they didn’t come out with some wins here, but we changed that narrative and look forward to bringing our best football to Santa Clara.That’ll be pretty special.”That measured mindset may explain why the celebration looked different. As cameras captured Anne Michael approaching him with visible excitement, Maye appeared subdued. For some fans, the contrast was jarring. “His body language is throwing me off. This was hard to watch. She was so excited for him,” one viewer wrote.Another added, “Why he lookin mad at her?” A third comment read, “He looks like he couldn’t care less that she’s there – and this is coming from a die hard patriots fan. It hardly looks like a couple celebrating going to the Super Bowl. Awkward.”Others rushed to his defense, pointing out the emotional toll of an AFC Championship and the laser focus required with a Super Bowl looming against the Seattle Seahawks. Maye has built his reputation on composure, not theatrics. What some saw as distance may simply reflect a quarterback still locked into work mode.In the end, the Patriots are back on the sport’s biggest stage. How Maye celebrates may matter far less than how he plays when it counts most.","Drake Maye's postgame interaction with his wife drew unexpected attention.

Years later, that fandom turned into a career-defining moment when Bieber shared her singing video and helped launch her music journey. Beer says the experience felt surreal and continues to shape how she views her path to stardom.

Madison Beer laughs off early fame roots tied to a Justin Bieber obsession

Madison Beer | Podcrushed | Ep. 146

Madison Beer did not grow up imagining herself as a pop star with platinum records and sold-out tours. She grew up as a fan. A devoted one. Long before industry meetings and studio sessions, her world revolved around a teenage superstar whose posters and music defined her childhood bedroom.That early devotion has now become part of her origin story. While promoting her new album Locket, Beer reflected on how deeply her younger self shaped the artist she is today. The memories came rushing back during a candid podcast conversation that revealed just how personal her journey into music truly was. What began as admiration eventually became a life-altering connection.During the discussion, Beer did not hesitate when asked who mattered most to her at age 12. “Transparently, Justin Bieber,” she said. “If you scroll all the way down to my Instagram, one of my first posts was literally a cardboard cut out of him in my room.” She went further, admitting, “He was definitely my obsession.”That obsession soon collided with opportunity. In 2012, Bieber shared a video of Beer singing Etta James’ “At Last,” a moment that instantly changed her life. She recalled the shock of that day with clarity.“Then I just kept on going with my normal life and it was just this big deal for a second and then I ended up meeting him and I ended up signing with him and it was a whirlwind,” she said. “For a girl who would have had him in her locket and a cardboard cutout in her room was nuts.”More than a decade later, that early connection has matured into a lasting bond. Beer has spoken openly about her continued closeness with Bieber and his wife. “I love [Justin] and Hailey [Bieber] very much,” she previously shared. “I was with them recently and we were like, ‘How special that we’ve known each other for so long.’”Now 26, Beer sees Locket as a tribute to the girl she once was. The fan. The dreamer. The teenager who believed in music before it believed back. Her story is not just about being discovered. It is about how childhood passion can quietly chart the course of an entire life.","Madison Beer grew up as a Justin Bieber fan. She kept a cardboard cutout of him in her room at age 12.

“Nobody is going to hand him anything”: Travis Kelce’s Hollywood ambitions face early skepticism from industry insiders,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/nobody-is-going-to-hand-him-anything-travis-kelces-hollywood-ambitions-face-early-skepticism-from-industry-insiders/articleshow/127702816.cms,"Travis Kelce is exploring a future in entertainment as his NFL career faces uncertainty, but insiders say Hollywood is unconvinced. Despite his fame and early appearances, sources claim he must prove real commitment and hunger to succeed. Industry figures reportedly believe visibility alone will not secure roles, warning that a second career will require effort, focus, and humility.

Travis Kelce’s Hollywood ambitions face early skepticism from industry insiders

Travis Kelce is standing at a crossroads that feels both promising and unforgiving. With his NFL future no longer guaranteed, attention has quietly shifted to what comes next. Fame is not the issue. Opportunity is not either. What hangs in the balance is whether he is willing to grind in an industry that does not bend easily for anyone, no matter how recognizable their name may be.Kelce has already made visible moves beyond football, testing the waters with acting, hosting, and podcasting. Yet behind the scenes, sources say confidence alone will not carry him forward. Hollywood, unlike the NFL, does not hand out roles based on reputation. The transition requires focus, humility, and a level of commitment that insiders say Kelce has yet to fully demonstrate.A source close to the situation told Star that visibility does not equal credibility in entertainment. “No matter how high his profile is, nobody is just going to hand him anything,” the insider said, adding that industry professionals sense his “head just isn’t in the game.”That perception matters. Unlike aspiring actors chasing their first break, Kelce enters the space already wealthy and globally known.Insiders believe that difference works against him. “Nobody is getting on TV or into action movies unless they really want it and can prove they can handle that kind of responsibility,” the source explained.“To branch out, Travis has to show that he can do more than a goofy appearance in Happy Gilmore 2. If he really wants this second career, he’s going to have to dance for it like everyone else!”The message from Hollywood appears blunt but consistent. Entertainment rewards hunger, not comfort. While Kelce’s résumé shows promise, decision makers reportedly want to see sustained effort rather than scattered appearances. Hosting a game show or popping up in a comedy cameo opens doors, but it does not secure a long-term lane.For Kelce, the challenge now is not access. It is intent. If football ends sooner than planned, his next chapter will demand more than charm and connections. It will require proving that he wants this career as badly as he once wanted every yard on the field.","Travis Kelce is exploring a future in entertainment as his NFL career faces uncertainty.

Gisele Bündchen looks at peace as Tom Brady admits divorce weighed on his final season

Gisele Bündchen appears fully at ease in this new phase of her life, and recent moments in Miami made that unmistakably clear. As her former marriage continues to be publicly dissected through Tom Brady’s reflections, Bündchen is choosing calm, privacy, and presence. The contrast could not be sharper. While past emotions resurface in interviews and viral clips, she is visibly grounded, focused on family and forward motion.Spotted enjoying a quiet afternoon on the water with her husband Joaquim Valente and their baby son, the supermodel looked settled and unbothered by the noise surrounding her past. The timing stood out. Just days earlier, Brady had openly admitted how deeply their divorce affected the final stretch of his legendary NFL career. Yet Bündchen’s demeanor suggested someone no longer living in that chapter.While appearing on television earlier this month, Brady did not shy away from the toll his personal life took during his final season. “My last season was tough,” he said. “I was going through a lot of just a personal family issue, and it was a challenge… It just took a lot out of me in terms of my ability to continue to play.”He later added, “I had 23 years of it, so I didn't feel like I was missing anything retiring.I was 45 years old. I wanted to spend time with my kids. I felt like, ‘Okay, now it's time for me to be at all my kids' games.’”As those words circulated, Bündchen was seen leaning toward her infant son, relaxed and attentive, while Valente stayed close. Sources say Brady was informed of Bündchen’s recent marriage out of respect for their shared children.“It wasn't a secret to him,” one insider explained. “They still have to talk because of the kids, and important milestones like her getting married was something she wasn't going to keep secret.”Another source added that Brady has accepted her happiness. “He's happy in a way that is simple: he's happy that she is happy.” While Brady has since drawn attention for a flirty New Year’s Eve moment with social media star Alix Earle, Bündchen’s focus seems unchanged.Her message is quiet but clear. She has moved on, not with spectacle, but with peace.","Gisele Bündchen was seen enjoying a quiet afternoon on the water with her husband Joaquim Valente and their baby son.

“A safety hazard”: JJ Redick sounds alarm over arena safety after Luka Doncic’s injury in Lakers vs Cavs matchup,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nba/top-stories/a-safety-hazard-jj-redick-sounds-alarm-over-arena-safety-after-luka-doncics-injury-in-lakers-vs-cavs-matchup/articleshow/127753717.cms,"Luka Doncic and JJ Redick.

JJ Redick calls out “safety hazard” after Luka Doncic injury raises serious concerns during Lakers vs Cavaliers clash



What happened to Luka Doncic?



LeBron James’ homecoming in Cleveland took an uneasy turn when Luka Doncic went down early, shifting attention from nostalgia to safety concerns inside Rocket Arena. The Lakers’ visit was meant to celebrate legacy. However, the night quickly became about player well-being after Doncic suffered a frightening fall near the court’s edge. As the arena grew quiet, questions followed about whether the playing surface itself played a role in the incident.The moment lingered even after play resumed. Doncic returned before the end of the first quarter. However, the concerns and questions still loomed. Lakers head coach JJ Redick did not hide his frustration postgame, directing focus toward an issue he believes demands urgent attention across the league.JJ Redick addressed the incident directly after the 129-99 loss, pointing to the elevated court design in Cleveland. “It is absolutely a safety hazard,” Redick said after the game, according to ESPN’s Dave McMenamin. His comments aligned with the growing concerns around Rocket Arena, the only NBA venue with a raised hardwood floor.Doncic was injured after drifting out of bounds on a three-point attempt and landing on uneven ground near the crowd.The Cavaliers share the building with the AHL’s Cleveland Monsters, and the ice beneath the court requires a separation layer that raises the floor. While the design improves sightlines, it also creates a sharp edge when players carry momentum beyond the boundary line.Other NBA teams share arenas with NHL franchises and use different solutions. That contrast has fueled debate about why Cleveland has yet to adjust its setup, especially after past injuries raised similar alarms.Doncic rolled his left ankle after his foot came down past the end of the court following a fadeaway jumper. He remained on the floor for several moments before limping to the locker room. According to The Athletic’s Dan Woike, he returned to the bench shortly after and re-entered the game with a little over a minute left in the first quarter.The Lakers’ star later led the team with 29 points, easing fears of a serious setback. He did miss roughly six minutes while his ankle was examined, a brief absence that still sent a chill through the Lakers’ bench during a crucial stretch of the road trip.Cleveland turned a tight first half into a runaway victory behind a dominant third quarter. The Cavaliers outscored Los Angeles 42-22 in the period, powered by Donovan Mitchell’s 25 points and Jaylon Tyson’s 20. De’Andre Hunter added 19, while Jarrett Allen chipped in 17 points and nine rebounds.LeBron James finished with 11 points in his return to Cleveland and became emotional during a video tribute in the first quarter. The Cavaliers extended their winning streak to five, while the Lakers fell to 3-2 on the trip.",Luka Doncic went down early in Lakers' 129-99 loss to Cleveland Cavaliers. Head coach JJ Redick called out elevated court design as a'safety hazard' Cleveland shares Rocket Arena with the NHL's Cleveland Monsters. The raised floor creates a sharp edge when players carry momentum beyond the line.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127753703,imgsize-34104,width-400,resizemode-4/luka-doncic-and-jj-redick.jpg"

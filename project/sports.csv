Sunil Chhetri on verge of retirement; here’s what he told India manager Khalid Jamil,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/top-stories/sunil-chhetri-on-the-verge-of-retiring-this-is-what-he-told-india-manager-khalid-jamil/articleshow/125146966.cms,"Sunil Chhetri (PTI Photo/Swapan Mahapatra)

In an exclusive chat with TOI, Sunil Chhetri opened up about his plans for life after football, hinting that the upcoming 2025-26 season could be his last if Bengaluru FC fail to lift the Indian Super League (ISL) title or secure qualification for continental tournaments.“If we win the ISL, it’ll allow me to wear the club’s colours on the international stage once more. But at 42, it’s tough. My goal is to score 15 goals this season and then retire,” Chhetri said.One of India’s all-time greats, Chhetri had brought the curtains down on his international career in June last year with an emotional farewell at Kolkata’s Salt Lake Stadium. He later made a brief comeback in June 2025 at the insistence of coach Manolo Marquez. Now that India’s hopes of qualifying for the Asian Cup 2027 final round are over, the veteran forward confirmed his return to the national team was short-lived.“It wasn’t hard telling Khalid sir about my decision,” Chhetri said. “When I came back, my only aim was to help India in the qualifiers. That was it. If the qualifiers hadn’t been there, I probably wouldn’t have returned. Once we were out, I felt at peace stepping away again, and the coach understood.”Also Read: Sunil Chhetri calls time on India career: 'At 42, it’s not easy' Earlier this year, when Manolo Marquez first reached out about a possible return, Chhetri had declined. But after his impressive ISL season—14 goals, just behind Golden Boot winner Alaaeddine Ajaraie—Marquez called again. This time, Chhetri took advice from his family and close friends before deciding to follow his instincts.“I knew the call came because of my ISL form,” he explained. “The qualifiers made me say yes in the end.”However, his second stint didn’t bring the success he had hoped for. Despite being the top-ranked team in the group, India failed to win any of their four games and were eliminated. Chhetri found the net only once in six matches after his return, finishing with 95 international goals—fourth on the all-time men’s list, behind only Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi among active players.Was there disappointment? “I’ve played long enough to know how football works,” he said. “There are no regrets about returning. The only regret is that we couldn’t qualify. I gave my best every game.”Chhetri also shared that he had declined the captaincy during his comeback, wanting others like Gurpreet Singh Sandhu, Sandesh Jhingan, and Rahul Bheke to take up leadership roles.“I’m thankful to the national camp for the warmth and respect I received,” he said. “It felt like rejoining family. The only bitter part is that we didn’t qualify. We had the team to do it, but we fell short.”",Sunil Chhetri hints that the upcoming 2025-26 season could be his last if Bengaluru FC fail to lift the Indian Super League title or secure qualification for continental tournaments.

Suryakumar Yadav loses his temper at Shivam Dube during 4th T20I vs Australia,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/india-vs-australia/suryakumar-yadav-loses-his-temper-at-shivam-dube-during-4th-t20i-vs-australia/articleshow/125147036.cms,"Suryakumar Yadav & Shivam Dube (X)

Shivam Dube press conference: All-rounder reveals India's bowling blueprint behind win over Australia

India captain Suryakumar Yadav , usually calm and collected on the field, was seen losing his temper during the fourth T20I against Australia at Carrara Oval in Queensland. Despite the brief flare-up, India cruised to a 48-run victory in the must-win clash, levelling the intensity of the series.The incident unfolded on the final delivery of the 12th over in Australia’s chase of 168. Shivam Dube had just dismissed Tim David and applied pressure on new batter Marcus Stoinis with two consecutive dot balls. However, the bowler erred on the last ball, sending down a short delivery well outside off stump. Stoinis took full advantage, cutting it for a boundary over backward point.As the ball sped to the fence, an animated Suryakumar was seen shouting in frustration at Dube, clearly upset at the release of pressure in a critical moment.India, though, recovered swiftly to dominate the remainder of the match. Washington Sundar sparked a stunning collapse, claiming three wickets in the space of five balls as Australia folded from a strong 91 for 4 in the 12th over to 119 all out in 18.2 overs. It was the hosts’ second-lowest T20 total on home soil, behind only their 111 against New Zealand in Sydney in 2022.India’s spinners were the architects of the win, sharing six wickets between them.Sundar finished with figures of 3 for 3 from just 1.2 overs, Axar Patel contributed 2 for 20, and Varun Chakravarthy added 1 for 26.Axar’s all-round effort earned him the Player of the Match award after his unbeaten 21 off 11 balls lifted India past 150 earlier in the innings. “Batting at No. 7 helped me understand the surface,” Axar said. “The ball wasn’t coming on nicely and there was uneven bounce. I just focused on bowling straight and making an impact for the team.”Earlier, Shubman Gill anchored the innings with a solid 46 off 39 balls as India posted 167 for 8 after being sent in to bat. Adam Zampa was Australia’s best bowler, returning 3 for 45 from his four overs.The result gave India a 2-1 lead in the five-match series, with the final game scheduled for Saturday in Brisbane.","India captain Suryakumar Yadav seen losing his temper during the fourth T20I against Australia at Carrara Oval in Queensland.

Inside story of Sachin Tendulkar's injuries: The untold secrets of cricket’s greatest icon

Poll Did Ravi Shastri give good advice to Sachin Tendulkar during his first tour of Australia? Yes, absolutely! No, he should have encouraged him to speak.

NEW DELHI: Former India all-rounder and head coach Ravi Shastri has revealed a fiery behind-the-scenes story from Sachin Tendulkar ’s first tour of Australia in 1991-92, when he told the 18-year-old prodigy to stay calm and “let the bat do the talking” amid a heated exchange with the Aussies.Speaking at the Summer of Cricket Lunch hosted by Cricket ACT, Shastri vividly recalled the Sydney Test, where he smashed a double century (206) while the teenage Tendulkar — already a rising star — was beginning to show glimpses of greatness.“I remember playing at the SCG. It was Sachin’s first tour. I had just reached a hundred, and Sachin had just come to bat. And he was being sledged by the Waugh brothers – Steve and Mark. ‘You little this, you little that’,” Shastri recounted.As the atmosphere heated up, even Mike Whitney, Australia’s 12th man, got involved, prompting one of Shastri’s trademark comebacks.“Mike Whitney had come on to the field. I was having a pow-wow with Allan Border until I reached my 100. He took the ball and said, ‘Get back into your crease; I’ll break your head’. I turned and shouted across the SCG, ‘Hey Mike! If you could throw as well as you bowl, you wouldn’t be the 12th man of Australia.’And that was it,” Shastri said to laughter.But when young Tendulkar expressed a desire to return fire with words once he reached his hundred, Shastri quickly put his foot down.“Sachin came to me and said, ‘Wait till I get to my hundred. I’ll also give them some of this.’ I told him, ‘You shut up. You’ve got enough class; your bat will do the talking. Let me do the talking.’”That advice, as history would show, defined Tendulkar’s approach for decades. The “Little Master” went on to torment Australia like few others — piling up 6,707 runs across formats — letting his bat speak louder than any words ever could.","Former India all-rounder Ravi Shastri has revealed a fiery behind-the-scenes story from Sachin Tendulkar’s first tour of Australia in 1991-92.

Shane Watson hits out at IPL rule, explains Shubman Gill captaincy situation and more

Poll Should the ICC change the review rule regarding dot balls after a successful appeal? Yes, it's crucial for maintaining run integrity No, the current rule works fine

Former India all-rounder Irfan Pathan has called on the International Cricket Council (ICC) to change an existing rule, after looking back at a moment that involved Team India vice-captain and star batter Shubman Gill Pathan’s remarks came after a moment involving Gill in the fourth T20I between India and Australia in Queensland.In the 14th over, Gill was adjudged LBW while attempting a flick off Marcus Stoinis. The batter reviewed the call immediately, and replays confirmed a clear inside edge. The decision was overturned, but the delivery was still recorded as a dot ball.Speaking on his YouTube channel, Pathan said, “If you appeal and the umpire gives it out and a batter takes a review and if it goes outside leg stump, it’s not out. The ball takes the pad and goes away but you miss that run and you have to come back on strike because a review is taken.”He added that such moments could have serious implications in crucial matches. “You keep the game on and the run won’t be missed. Otherwise, every team will miss the run. Just imagine, it’s a World Cup final and you lose by a run and this could be that run. ICC needs to change this rule. It will be a problem if it’s not changed,” Pathan said.Reflecting on India’s 48-run win at the Gold Coast, the former cricketer lauded the team’s all-round effort. “The Indian team is like if you doubt them even a bit, they will crush it and move forward. It was a fantastic victory at the Gold Coast,” he said, praising contributions from Washington Sundar, Axar Patel, and Shubman Gill.Meanwhile, former Australia all-rounder Shane Watson has backed Gill to bounce back from his lean run, calling him “ridiculously talented.” Watson said, “It does take time (to make adjustments)... but Shubman is a ridiculously talented batter. He’s got an amazing technique.”India will look to seal the series when they face Australia in the final T20I at the Gabba on Saturday.After a lean run of gams, Gill's 46 from 39 balls was in sharp contrast to the scores of 5 and 15 in his previous two outings.","Former India all-rounder Irfan Pathan has called on the International Cricket Council (ICC) to change an existing rule.

Shivam Dube press conference: All-rounder reveals India's bowling blueprint behind win over Australia

Willow Talk Cricket

Australia captain Alyssa Healy has opened up about the heartbreaking semi-final loss to India at the ICC Women’s World Cup, admitting the defeat in Navi Mumbai still “hurts” and will take time to move on from.India had stunned Australia by successfully chasing 339 – the highest-ever run chase in World Cup knockout history across both men’s and women’s cricket – before going on to win the title against South Africa in the final.Speaking on thepodcast, Healy said she was proud of her team’s campaign but couldn’t shake off the pain of falling short against India. “I won’t lie, I’ve been better,” she said. “We played some really incredible cricket over seven weeks but just couldn’t get past that Indian hurdle. It’s disappointing, but I’m excited about what this team can do in the next cycle.”Healy admitted that Australia had left runs on the field despite posting 338, with Phoebe Litchfield scoring her maiden World Cup century. “I actually thought we were a bit under-par. When Pez (Ellyse Perry) and Phoebe were batting, we were looking at 350-plus.If we had pushed up there, it might have made a difference,” she said.Reflecting on why the loss stung so much, Healy said it was because the team had been performing at such a high level throughout the tournament. “Everyone was contributing, everyone was playing out of their skin, and we just had half an off night in a knockout game. It’s sad that we don’t have a trophy to show for it.”Healy also explained how the conditions at DY Patil Stadium played a role, revealing that the red-soil pitch behaved differently under lights. “The wicket was slower early on, and under lights it started sliding on nicely. We probably weren’t quick enough to adapt with the ball and missed our lengths a little at the back end,” she said.Two dropped catches off Jemimah Rodrigues , who remained unbeaten on 127, proved costly. Healy also recalled her own dismissal during a chaotic phase affected by lighting issues. “There was a lot happening around the sightscreen and lights. It was frustrating. If I had waited a minute longer, we’d have gone off the field and come back again,” she said.Despite the disappointment, Healy praised India for their composure and called the victory a great moment for the global game. “India got themselves over the line, and it’s great for women’s cricket. It’ll haunt me for a little while, but that’s okay,” she concluded.",Australia captain Alyssa Healy has opened up about the heartbreaking semi-final loss to India at the ICC Women’s World Cup.

Former England fast bowler Steven Finn believes the Australian media’s attempt to provoke Ben Stokes ahead of the Ashes could end up backfiring, warning that the England captain is at his best when challenged.Stokes’ arrival in Perth drew headlines from The West Australian, which mocked him as “Cocky Captain Complainer” and labelled his team’s tactics “dopey”. But Finn, who was part of England’s last Ashes triumph in Australia in 2010-11, thinks such criticism will only fuel the all-rounder’s competitive fire.“Ben Stokes thrives when he has a point to prove,” Finn told the PA news agency, adding that some players simply become stronger when targeted.The former pacer explained that Stokes’ leadership style is anything but cautious, describing him as someone who embraces pressure and confronts challenges head-on. He also cautioned that while the Australian press tries to find weaknesses, Stokes and coach Brendon McCullum ’s fearless mindset could help England turn the narrative in their favour.Reflecting on his own experiences Down Under, Finn noted that early success can shift public sentiment quickly, recalling how the Australian crowd began to respect England’s resilience during the 2010-11 series.Finn also compared Stokes and McCullum’s aggressive approach with the more conservative style of previous England teams, suggesting that the current leadership’s boldness gives them a real shot at redefining England’s fortunes in Australia.“An away Ashes series can be career-defining,” Finn said. “The way Stokes and McCullum lead, they give players the freedom to be themselves and express their best cricket.”",Former England fast bowler Steven Finn believes the Australian media’s attempt to provoke Ben Stokes ahead of the Ashes could end up backfiring.

However, names of cricketing stalwarts like Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli are absent from the squad list.Former captain Shreyas Iyer will not participate in the series due to an injury he sustained during last month's match in Sydney against Australia.Wicketkeeper-batsman Ishan Kishan has earned his place in the 14-member squad following his impressive performances for Jharkhand in the Ranji Trophy.The squad features T20 regulars, including Abhishek Sharma , Arshdeep Singh, and Harshit Rana.Players like Riyan Parag, Ayush Badoni, Nishant Sindhu, and Prabhsimran Singh have maintained their positions in the team after being selected for the previous series against Australia A.The three-match series is scheduled to take place at the Niranjan Shah Stadium in Rajkot between November 13 and 19.Rohit and Virat recently made their return to competetive cricket, playing for India during three ODI matches in Australia.Both players showed impressive performances.Rohit, who earned the man of the series title, had a slow start but recovered strongly. After an initial setback in the first match, he scored 73 and 121 not out in subsequent games.Virat struggled initially with ducks in the first two matches but bounced back with 74 not out in the final game.India’s men’s senior team is set to play a three-match ODI series against South Africa later this month.

India’s captain in Tests and ODIs, Shubman Gill , finds himself under increasing scrutiny as his struggles with the bat continue during the ongoing tour of Australia. The 25-year-old, who made his T20I comeback at the 2025 Asia Cup after nearly a year away from the format, has found it difficult to rediscover his touch. In 10 innings since his return, he has scored only 184 runs at an average of 23 and a strike rate of 146, with a highest score of 47. His ODI form has also been below par, with just 43 runs across three matches against Australia last month.Overall, Gill’s T20I record stands at 31 matches, 762 runs, an average of 28.22 and a strike rate of 140.85, featuring three half-centuries and one hundred – the unbeaten 126 that remains his career-best.Ahead of the fourth T20I at Carrara Oval in Gold Coast, head coach Gautam Gambhir was seen engaging in a long conversation with Gill. In a video that quickly went viral, Gambhir appeared to call Gill aside for a serious chat while the team was preparing for training drills. The moment sparked plenty of discussion among fans online.Click here to watch: Gautam Gambhir’s long chat with Shubman Gill Gill’s recent scores across the ODI and T20I legs of the tour read 10, 9, 24, 37 not out, 5, and 15. The only innings where he looked settled came in Canberra, where he put together a promising stand with captain Suryakumar Yadav before rain ended the contest prematurely.With the series currently level at 1-1, the fourth T20I on Thursday presents a key opportunity for India to take the lead. For Gill, it could be an important outing to regain confidence and produce the kind of innings that once made him one of India’s most exciting young batters.","Shubman Gill has struggled with the bat during India's tour of Australia.

Poll How do you feel about Pratika Rawal's emotional reaction to her team's victory? Extremely touched Happy for her Indifferent Disappointed for her

What do the rules suggest?



After days of anticipation, Pratika Rawal finally received her World Cup medal, and the joy was written all over her face when she, along with her victorious Team India members, met Prime Minister Narendra Modi.PM Narendra Modi on Wednesday met the Indian women’s cricket team following their historic ODI World Cup triumph at his official residence at Lok Kalyan Marg.PM Modi congratulated the Harmanpreet Kaur-led side — dressed in smart formal attire and wearing their winner’s medals — on their historic achievement and praised their remarkable comeback in the tournament after a string of three defeats in the league stage and the trolling they had faced on social media platforms.Pratika Rawal, who was ruled out of the ICC Women’s Cricket World Cup 2025 due to an ankle injury, had been one of India’s standout performers before her setback. The 24-year-old finished as the second-highest run-scorer for the team with 308 runs, including a century and a half-century.Sharing her emotions while celebrating from the sidelines in a wheelchair, Pratika said: “I can’t even express it. There are no words.This flag on my shoulder means so much. To be here with my team — it’s surreal. Injuries are part of the game, but I’m just so happy I could still be part of this team.“I love this team. I can’t express what I feel — we actually did it! We’re the first Indian team to win the World Cup in so long. The whole of India deserves this. Honestly, it was harder to watch than to play. Every wicket, every boundary — it gave me goosebumps. The energy, the crowd, the emotion — it was incredible.”According to ICC regulations, medals are awarded only to players in the final 15-member squad. Since Rawal was replaced before the semifinal, she missed out on the winner’s medal, even though her runs were instrumental in setting up India’s title charge. Interestingly, a similar situation occurred in the 2003 Men’s World Cup when Australia’s Jason Gillespie, despite taking eight wickets in four games, was replaced after an injury and did not receive a medal.","Pratika Rawal was ruled out of the ICC Women’s Cricket World Cup 2025 due to an ankle injury.

How PM Modi kept the conversation very light with India women's team

JioStar

UP Warriorz head coach Abhishek Nayar has shed light on the franchise’s surprising decision to release star all-rounder Deepti Sharma ahead of the upcoming Women’s Premier League (WPL) 2025 season. Deepti, who was recently named Player of the Tournament in India’s triumphant ODI World Cup campaign, found herself among several high-profile names dropped by the franchise despite her stellar form.The UP-based side, which reached the playoffs in the inaugural edition of the WPL, opted for a major overhaul this time. From their previous roster, only promising youngster Shweta Sehrawat has been retained from the uncapped Indian pool. Overseas stalwarts Alyssa Healy , Sophie Ecclestone, Grace Harris, Tahlia McGrath, and Alana King have all been released, along with Indian names such as Deepti Sharma and Kranti Goud.Speaking on, Nayar admitted that such decisions are never easy but insisted that the franchise wanted to reset and enter the mega auction with flexibility and a healthy purse.“When it comes to retentions, it’s always difficult because you’re dealing with world-class players and leaders in their own right,” Nayar explained. “The idea from the franchise was to start afresh, have more money available in the purse, and build a team that can go all the way.”He also hinted that the Warriorz might try to bring some of their released players back through the auction. “We wanted to make sure we have enough resources to get the players we believe can win the championship — and hopefully reacquire some of them at the auction,” he added.Deepti, who delivered a sensational all-round performance at the ODI World Cup — scoring 215 runs and taking 22 wickets, including a match-winning fifty and five-wicket haul in the final against South Africa — was seen as one of the key figures in India’s campaign. Her omission from the Warriorz roster has therefore raised eyebrows.Nayar concluded by reaffirming that while the choices may seem bold, the franchise’s intent is clear. “These calls are never easy, but we believe in our process. The goal now is to go into the auction with intent, make smart decisions, and put together a side capable of winning the title,” he said.",UP Warriorz coach Abhishek Nayar has shed light on the franchise’s surprising decision to release star all-rounder Deepti Sharma.

Faheem Ashraf chipped in with 28 as Pakistan scored 90 in the final 10 overs.Corbin Bosch took two wickets for South Africa, while Nqabayomzi Peter claimed 3/55.South Africa’s chase was made easy by the steady partnership between de Kock and de Zorzi, who added the second-highest ODI partnership for the Proteas against Pakistan in Pakistan. The Proteas smashed a combined 11 sixes, helping South Africa surpass 270 with ease — the second-highest successful chase by the Proteas against Pakistan in ODIs.The win not only leveled the series 1-1 but also demonstrated South Africa’s superior adaptability in foreign conditions.

'They pull our players away': Brian Lara explains West Indies cricket's decline

West Indies produced a power-hitting masterclass but still fell agonisingly short, losing to New Zealand by three runs in a high-scoring thriller at Eden Park on Thursday. The result levelled the five-match T20I series 1-1.New Zealand’s victory was built on Mark Chapman’s explosive 78 off just 28 balls, which propelled the hosts to 207 for 5 after a slow start.Coming in with the score at 81/2 in the 12th over, Chapman tore into the West Indian bowlers, smashing seven sixes and six fours.His acceleration — 66 runs from his next 19 balls — turned the innings around, as New Zealand piled on 126 runs in the final eight overs.Daryl Mitchell (28 off 14) and skipper Mitchell Santner (18 off 8) provided valuable support, while for West Indies, Tiaan van Vuuren (4/52) and Tshepo Moreki (2/52) were among the wickets.In reply, West Indies unleashed their own barrage of boundaries, hitting 18 sixes — the joint-most by a full-member nation in a T20I chase, matching England’s feat against them in 2023.Despite a spirited effort from Rovman Powell (45 off 16), Romario Shepherd (34 off 16), and Matthew Forde (29 off 13), the visitors were restricted to 204 for 8. Forde could only manage a single off the final ball when a boundary was needed to tie.New Zealand’s spinners proved decisive. Ish Sodhi (3/39) and Mitchell Santner (3/31) shared six wickets — only the second time Kiwi spinners have taken that many in a home T20I.The three-run margin was New Zealand’s joint second-lowest T20I win (after one-run victories over India and Pakistan) and also equalled West Indies’ second-narrowest defeat.Despite the loss, West Indies etched several records — including the highest ever score (87/2) in overs 16–20 of a T20I chase and their third 200-plus total without a 50-plus individual score.The two sides will meet again for the third T20I in Nelson on Sunday, with the series delicately poised at 1-1.","West Indies produced a power-hitting masterclass but still fell agonisingly short, losing to New Zealand by three runs in a high-scoring thriller at Eden Park.

Former Australia captain Steve Waugh calls Virat Kohli the ODI GOAT

Poll Is Virat Kohli the greatest one-day player of all time? Absolutely Not sure No, there are better players

NEW DELHI: Former Australia captain Steve Waugh has paid glowing tribute to Virat Kohli , calling the Indian superstar the “greatest one-day player of all time” and a “once-in-a-generation” cricketer who has redefined the art of batting in limited-overs cricket.Speaking to reporters on Thursday, Waugh was effusive in his praise for the Indian maestro, who turned 37 this week. “Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma are two all-time great players. Virat Kohli is probably the greatest one-day player of all time. You want to see them play everywhere… but they can’t play every match,” Waugh said.Since making his debut in 2008, Kohli has amassed 14,255 runs in 305 ODIs, including a record 51 centuries. His unrivalled consistency and chase mastery have earned him the moniker of “Chase Master,” as he continues to dominate the ODI format with his trademark intensity and precision.Recalling his recent brilliance, Waugh referenced Kohli’s composed 74 off 81 balls during India’s commanding nine-wicket win over Australia in Sydney last month, where former skipper Rohit Sharma struck an unbeaten 121. “It’s always great to see all-time great players in action.Someone like Virat Kohli, that’s a once-in-a-generation sort of player. If you get a chance, you want to see him play,” Waugh said.Waugh also lauded India’s transition under a fresh T20 setup following the retirements of Kohli and Rohit from the shortest format after the 2024 T20 World Cup triumph. “They’ve got a modern T20 side now with a lot of exciting stars… the game has to evolve,” he added.","Former Australia captain Steve Waugh calls Virat Kohli the ODI GOAT.

Brief scores: India 'A' (1st innings: 255) all out in 77.1 overs (Dhruv Jurel 132 n.o.; Tshepo Moreki 2-52, Prenelan Subrayen 2-73, Tiaan Van Vuuren 4-52) vs South Africa 'A'

With Rishabh Pant back in the Indian Test squad, wicketkeeper Dhruv Jurel may return to the bench. However, Jurel proved his batting value on Thursday at the BCCI Centre of Excellence, scoring a sublime unbeaten 132 (175b; 12x4; 4x6) for India 'A' against South Africa 'A'. This was his third century in seven innings, including a previous 125 against the West Indies in Ahmedabad.On day one of the second four-day match, Jurel stood tall as India 'A' were bowled out for 255 in 77.1 overs.Jurel was left to score more than 50% of his team's runs after other batters, barring KL Rahul (19) and Rishabh Pant (24), made it seem like they were batting on a different pitch.On a surface with a grass cover and seam conditions, India 'A' were struggling at 69/4 in the 29th over, when Jurel came out to bat. What he put up thereafter was a fine display of caution, controlled aggression, and fine stroke play.Jurel got down to business straight away. He opened his account by stepping out against off-spinner Prenelan Subrayen (2/73) and sending the ball over the long-on boundary for a six.Backed by impeccable timing and deft footwork, in the next over, Jurel targeted left-arm pacer Tiaan Van Vuuren (4/52), finding two boundaries to put pressure on the opposition.Jurel punished every loose delivery as he went about piling runs, even as he lost a couple of partners at the other end. With Kuleep Yadav (20; 88b), Jurel stitched together a defining 79-run (173 balls) partnership for the eighth wicket, which ended with a mix-up between the batters and Kuldeep found himself short of the crease. Jurel, who brought up his 50 in 62 deliveries, completed his century in 145 deliveries, with a single down the leg side.Jurel continued with the same intensity until he ran out of partners in the 78th over as Prasidh Krishna offered a return catch to Van Vuuren.Earlier, South Africa 'A' invited the new-look India 'A' team to bat. Tshepo Moreki (2/52) struck in the second over, when Abhimanyu Easwaran was beaten by swing and seam to be trapped leg-before.At the other end, Rahul looked at ease. With good bounce and carry, Rahul weathered it by playing close to the body and found the gaps regularly. But he went for a drive against Van Vuuren and offered an edge to wicketkeeper Connor Esterhuizen.With plenty of assistance for the bowlers in the first hour, India 'A' lost some quick wickets. Pant, in his typical style, started well. He found some quick runs against Subrayen, with a sweep shot which found the boundary and danced down the track for a maximum. But after taking a hit on the thumb, on the next delivery, he tried to launch Tshepo Moreki (2/52) over mid-off but miscued it to Marques Ackerman.","India 'A' bowled out for 255 in 77.1 overs on day one of second four-day match.

Poll How important do you think tactical planning is in T20 cricket? Very Important Somewhat Important Not Important Not Sure

NEW DELHI: India all-rounder Shivam Dube credited tactical planning and composure under pressure for India's commanding 48-run victory over Australia in the fourth T20I on Thursday, which handed the visitors an unassailable 2-1 lead in the five-match series.Speaking after the match, Dube said India's total of 167 for 8 was more than defendable given the ground dimensions and bowling strength.“167 on this ground is definitely a good score because of the quality bowling we have — the spinners, the fast bowlers. I trust them and the whole team trusts our bowlers,” Dube said at the post-match press conference.India's bowlers backed up that confidence with a clinical display, bundling out Australia for 119 in 18.2 overs. Dube, who picked 2 for 20, explained that exploiting the larger boundaries was central to their plan.“The plan was to bowl on the sides which have bigger boundaries because it's difficult to hit big — the boundaries were 80 metres plus,” he revealed. “We knew it won't be easy to hit, no matter how well you connect. So, the idea was to bowl smartly and force set batters to target the bigger sides.”Dube also credited India's coaching staff — head coach Gautam Gambhir , bowling coach Morne Morkel , and captain Suryakumar Yadav — for his growing confidence as a bowler.“Morne, Gauti bhai, and Surya prepared a good plan for me. Morne also gave small but useful tips that made my bowling better,” he said.Promoted to No. 3, Dube contributed 22 off 18 balls and revealed that he had worked specifically on handling bounce ahead of the tour.“In nets, I practised a lot on short balls because the bounce is more here.

NEW DELHI: India’s ODI World Cup-winning heroes Harmanpreet Kaur Smriti Mandhana , Jemimah Rodrigues and Shafali Verma headline the Women’s Premier League (WPL) retention list unveiled on Thursday, setting the stage for a high-stakes mega auction later this month.All five WPL franchises revealed their retained players — with a maximum limit of three Indian capped players, two overseas stars, and two Indian uncapped names per team. Mumbai Indians and Delhi Capitals have retained the maximum five players permitted under the rules.Harmanpreet will continue to lead Mumbai Indians alongside Hayley Matthews, Nat Sciver-Brunt, Amanjot Kaur and young G Kamalini. The franchise released key performers like Amelia Kerr, Pooja Vastrakar and Yastika Bhatia into the auction pool.Delhi Capitals made a bold call by letting go of skipper Meg Lanning despite three consecutive final appearances. Instead, they retained Jemimah Rodrigues, Shafali Verma, Annabel Sutherland, Marizanne Kapp, and uncapped Niki Prasad.Royal Challengers Bengaluru kept faith in their core, holding on to Smriti Mandhana, Ellyse Perry, Shreyanka Patil and Richa Ghosh.Meanwhile, the likes of Sophie Molineux, Renuka Singh Thakur, Sneh Rana and Danni Wyatt-Hodge have been released.UP Warriorz pressed the reset button by retaining just one player — Shweta Sehrawat, the Under-19 World Cup-winning batter — letting go of marquee stars Alyssa Healy, Deepti Sharma and Sophie Ecclestone. Deepti’s release, in particular, is one of the biggest shocks of the retention window, given her stellar form and back-to-back Player of the Tournament awards in both the 2024 WPL and the 2025 World Cup.Gujarat Giants have opted to retain the Australian duo of Ashleigh Gardner and Beth Mooney while releasing South Africa’s ODI World Cup top-scorer Laura Wolvaardt, Harleen Deol, and Kashvee Gautam.With RCB, Gujarat Giants, and UP Warriorz retaining fewer than five players, they will be the only sides eligible to use the Right to Match card at the WPL mega auction scheduled for November 27 in New Delhi.","Harmanpreet will continue to lead Mumbai Indians alongside Hayley Matthews, Nat Sciver-Brunt, Amanjot Kaur and young G Kamalini.

India players unwind at head coach Gautam Gambhir’s residence | Massive crowd greets them

India’s domination in the shortest format under head coach Gautam Gambhir continued as the visitors sealed a commanding 48-run win over Australia in the fourth T20I on Thursday, taking a 2-1 series lead after the first match was washed out.With this victory, India remain unbeaten in every T20I series since Gambhir took charge.Under his stewardship, India have whitewashed Sri Lanka (3-0) and Bangladesh (3-0) at home, triumphed 3-1 in South Africa, and edged England 4-1 at home so far.The ongoing series win in Australia adds yet another feather to the former opener’s coaching cap, as India will not lose the series Down Under.After being asked to bat first on Thursday, India posted 167/8, led by Shubman Gill’s 46 off 39 balls, with handy contributions from Abhishek Sharma (28) and Shivam Dube (22). Despite a middle-order wobble, Axar Patel’s late flourish (21 not out off 11) helped India reach a competitive total.Australia began their chase confidently through skipper Mitchell Marsh (30) and Matthew Short (25), but India’s bowlers soon seized control. Washington Sundar’s stunning spell of 3 wickets for just 3 runs in eight balls ripped through the tail, while consistent pressure from the seamers ensured Australia were bundled out for 119.As India head to Brisbane for the final T20I on Sunday, Gambhir’s record remains spotless in this format, a stark contrast to his early stumbles in Tests and ODIs.Gambhir endured his first Test series defeat as India’s head coach against New Zealand at home, while his ODI stint began with a heavy away series loss to Sri Lanka.Under his guidance, though, India’s T20 unit looks sharper, hungrier, and well on course to become an unstoppable force ahead of the 2026 T20 World Cup.","India beat Australia by 48 runs to take 2-1 series lead.

Joao Pedro lifts Chelsea to glory against Spurs



Liverpool secured a 2-0 victory against Aston Villa in the Premier League , ending their four-game losing streak. Mohamed Salah achieved his 250th goal for the club, and Ryan Gravenberch added another goal to help the defending champions move up to third place in the standings.""I'm glad we are back on track now. It's a very tricky season for us because we have a few new players, they are very good players, but they need time to adapt. We lost some players too. It takes time to adapt and know each other's games, but everything will be fine,"" said Salah.Liverpool manager Arne Slot's decision to make multiple changes during Wednesday's 3-0 League Cup loss to Crystal Palace increased pressure on the returning players to secure a win after six defeats in seven games across all competitions.""What I liked most was that I think everybody here felt the importance of the game. I'm talking about my players and I'm talking about the fans. From start to finish the players showed up,"" said Slot.Liverpool faced early pressure when Morgan Rogers hit the post with a shot after five minutes. This continued their pattern of struggling in the opening 15 minutes, which had been evident in their previous four Premier League defeats.Villa initially showed strength in breaking through Liverpool's defense but later struggled with their own defensive play. Dominik Szoboszlai missed an opportunity after taking the ball from Pau Torres, shooting directly at Martinez.Hugo Ekitike's header goal was disallowed after VAR review showed he was offside from Szoboszlai's cross. Martinez's error then allowed Salah to score just before half-time, marking his 250th goal for Liverpool.Salah's goal, his fifth of the season, places him as Liverpool's third-highest scorer in club history, behind only Ian Rush and Roger Hunt. The goal also ended Liverpool's streak of conceding first in seven consecutive games.Villa entered the match having won their previous four league games, including victories over Tottenham and Manchester City. They were level on points with Liverpool before the game.Gravenberch, who had missed the previous weekend's 3-2 loss at Brentford due to an ankle injury, scored Liverpool's second goal. His shot deflected off Pau Torres, deceiving Martinez.Liverpool achieved their first clean sheet in 11 games.

The victory reduced their gap behind Arsenal to seven points, providing a starting point for their return to the title race.Joao Pedro ended his goal drought for Chelsea by scoring the decisive goal in a 1-0 victory against Tottenham at their home stadium on Saturday.The Brazilian striker scored his first goal since August 30, when he last found the net against Fulham, breaking a nine-game goalless streak across all competitions.Since his £60 million transfer from Brighton during the transfer window, the 24-year-old has only managed to score three times for Chelsea.Chelsea moved to fourth place in the Premier League standings after securing their third win in four matches, trailing Tottenham only on goal difference.Tottenham's struggles at home continue, as they haven't secured a victory at their stadium since defeating Burnley in the season opener in August.Their poor home form in 2025 began under previous manager Ange Postecoglou and has persisted under Frank's leadership.Despite a League Cup defeat at Newcastle, Tottenham's away performances have been stronger, including a convincing 3-0 win at Everton in their last league match.Tottenham supporters are showing increasing dissatisfaction with Frank's tactical approach, which differs from the club's traditional attacking philosophy.An early setback occurred when Lucas Bergvall suffered a head injury and was replaced by Xavi Simons as a concussion substitute.Bergvall showed resistance to the medical staff's decision, pushing one of them before Frank stepped in to calm the situation.Alejandro Garnacho posed Chelsea's primary attacking threat in the first half, testing Tottenham goalkeeper Guglielmo Vicario with long-range attempts.Vicario recovered from a knee injury to make a crucial save, denying Joao Pedro after a defensive error by Pedro Porro.Joao Pedro broke the deadlock in the 34th minute, capitalising on Moises Caicedo's pressure on Simons and Van de Ven to score from close range.Frank expressed his frustration with Tottenham's defensive errors by kicking a water bottle on the sideline.Joao Pedro nearly doubled his tally, but Vicario saved his powerful shot following Malo Gusto's assist.Rodrigo Bentancur received a yellow card for a challenge on Reece James, which could have warranted a more severe punishment.Mohammed Kudus tested Chelsea goalkeeper Robert Sanchez just before halftime, but his shot was well saved.After the break, Enzo Fernandez missed a clear opportunity, heading over from James' cross from ten yards out.Tottenham's possession problems continued in the second half, leading to growing frustration among their supporters.Vicario was forced to make another save from Pedro Neto's powerful attempt, while Tottenham failed to mount a serious comeback in the closing stages.",Liverpool secured a 2-0 victory against Aston Villa in the Premier League.

More coverage on NFL:

Russell Wilson’s NFL storyline has taken a very different turn from what anyone imagined at the start of 2025. The veteran quarterback, once viewed as a dependable franchise cornerstone, is now benched for rookie Jaxson Dart in New York, and his football future is suddenly being analyzed more through off-field moments than on-field production.But while the trade deadline passed with no move, the noise didn’t die. Instead, it redirected, toward his powerful public appearance with Patriots owner Robert Kraft at Lazard’s Foursquare Conference. And what fans saw there wasn’t a defeated QB. It was a man who found purpose beyond depth charts and benching narratives and that’s why support is pouring in.Russell Wilson didn’t talk about excuses. He talked mindset. He shared that he was “Grateful to talk about Mindset & Mental Health for the @nfl,” while thanking Kraft and the event organizers for creating a space where football conversations finally feel human.His presence on a panel titled “Changing the Playbook on Mental Health” resonated more deeply than any headline about his demotion. Wilson reminded people he’s been doing this work since before the benching. The Why Not You Foundation, launched in 2014, has been pushing youth education, health access, and empowerment long before anyone questioned his QB1 future.Fans noticed. “This is what really matters,” one wrote. Another called him “a man of ambition.” And that’s the difference, Wilson’s next chapter isn’t defined by a depth chart. It’s defined by how he shows up for people.The Patriots staying silent at the trade deadline only added gasoline to speculation, but what people walked away with was something bigger: the belief Wilson still carries value beyond a single roster decision.No one knows if he takes another snap. His contract expiring only intensifies that mystery. But the reaction makes one thing clear, the league hasn’t emotionally checked out on Russell Wilson. Not even close.","Russell Wilson is finding new purpose beyond football.

Jason Kelce has never pretended that being a dad is easy and that’s exactly why his parenting stories often hit harder than his football analysis. The retired Eagles legend has become a fan favorite for showing the real side of parenthood on the “New Heights” podcast with his brother, Travis Kelce.His latest viral moment? An unfiltered Disney World confession that turned into a full-blown life lesson in sharing, waffle and a surprisingly heroic Jack Sparrow impersonator. As chaotic as it sounded, fans loved every minute of it. Jason wasn’t trying to be perfect. He was trying to be honest and that authenticity is exactly why Kelce family stories keep dominating the internet.Jason recalled they were having a great Disney day until breakfast flipped into a standoff between dad and daughter. “I’m in a full fight with Wyatt over a fi**king waffle. Ruins about 30 minutes of our entire day because she wants a whole waffle and I’m trying to explain to her that there’s only four waffles and there’s like f***ing 15 people.”His wife Kylie tried to defuse the tension, but Jason said his values had to stand, “I’m like, no, I’m not fing, I’m not raising some spoiled little f***ing rotten child. She’s getting hurt. She’s sharing.”Wyatt spiraled into meltdown territory, until theme park magic kicked in.

Travis joked, “You got some bougie kids, man.”Jason then pivoted into MLB disappointment, declaring the 2025 World Series result predictable and boring.

“Double standards”: Antonio Brown torches political hypocrisy as Zohran Mamdani wins New York mayor on historic night,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/double-standards-antonio-brown-torches-political-hypocrisy-as-zohran-mamdani-wins-new-york-mayor-on-historic-night/articleshow/125133397.cms,"Zohran Mamdani became New York City's first Muslim mayor, marking a significant progressive victory. His win faced harsh criticism and smears. Former NFL player Antonio Brown reacted to this event, posting on X about perceived double standards. He questioned how figures like Mamdani are framed by tech, media, and power elites.

Antonio Brown reacts to Zohran Mamdani elected mayor of New York on winning night for Democrats

More coverage on NFL:

Election night in New York wasn’t just about numbers, counties, or precinct maps, it was about a culture shift happening in real time. While Democrats racked up wins across the board, one result carried a different kind of weight and symbolism. Zohran Mamdani , a 34-year-old democratic socialist, officially became the first Muslim mayor in New York City history.His victory wasn’t the kind of institutional, establishment-safe win that political veterans are used to. It represented a reshuffling of who gets to lead, who gets amplified, and who gets taken seriously. And in the middle of the celebration, Antonio Brown found a way to press send and provoke a larger conversation.The political world was still processing a stunning, generational shift Tuesday night and right on cue, Antonio Brown found a way to insert himself into the conversation. The former NFL wideout, who has become more known for posting hot takes than catching touchdowns posted, “Double Standard @elonmusk” on X along with a clip of Zohran Mamdani’s victory moment.Zohran Mamdani’s election, becoming New York City’s first Muslim mayor and the city’s youngest in more than 100 years,wasn’t just a quirky headline buried in election scrolls.It was the biggest progressive victory of the night. The 34-year-old democratic socialist defeated former governor Andrew Cuomo and Republican Curtis Sliwa, and did it after enduring “jihadist” smears and insinuations he’d “cheer” another 9/11. This wasn’t a gentle campaign. This was a street fight.Yet on election night, hand over heart, smiling through the spotlight, Mamdani looked like the exact opposite of the caricature his critics pushed.And that may have been why Antonio Brown reacted. He wasn’t weighing in on housing policy or free buses, he was pointing toward the public double standards around who tech, media, and power elites choose to frame as “radical,” “dangerous,” or “unfit.”That’s where the Elon Musk tag becomes the point, not the punchline. Brown didn’t need paragraphs to make that subtext clear. Sometimes four words are enough to set the internet on fire.","Zohran Mamdani, a 34-year-old democratic socialist, officially became the first Muslim mayor in New York City history.

Gisele Bündchen is leaning into her role not as a model, but as a climate narrator next to Prince William

More coverage on NFL:

Gisele Bündchen never just posts a cute outfit for the sake of it, there’s always meaning attached. And this week, the supermodel’s Instagram Story served two purposes at once: promoting Prince William’s Earthshot Prize finalists while embracing a gauzy, lace-trimmed boho blouse that instantly sent fashion watchers into screenshot mode.Through her sheer, frill-detailed top, she wasn’t trying to sell a trend, she was planting a reminder about environmental action, Brazilian heritage, and her evolving role as a global cultural voice post-runway. Bündchen is not just a council member this year, she’s positioned almost as Earthshot’s human bridge between royal diplomacy, South American innovation, and climate storytelling that non-activists can actually connect with.While Prince William has been photographed across Rio de Janeiro this week, including that resonant Christ the Redeemer moment which almost visually echoes Princess Diana’s 1991 trip, Bündchen’s narrative tone is what Swifties would call “ground level credibility.” Her IG messaging makes the climate conversation sound emotional, not bureaucratic.“Being a part of selecting this year's incredible winners has been an inspiring experience,” she said. “Trust me, their ideas are going to change the future.” Then she doubled down: “It's truly the most inspiring night for our earth,” she added. “Don't miss it!”Her partnership with William was only formally announced a month ago, but it already feels like one of the most effective swaps in modern royal strategy, using a non-royal with real cultural pull to simplify complex environmental tech.And for Bündchen, the Earthshot role is arguably her most meaningful rebrand since leaving the runway: she’s replacing couture exclusivity with global accessibility and doing it in a sheer blouse that’s already going viral.","Gisele Bündchen is promoting Prince William's Earthshot Prize finalists.

“Huge lawsuit on the horizon”: Taylor Swift fans push her to sue Donald Trump as she is busy planning her future with Travis Kelce,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/huge-lawsuit-on-the-horizon-taylor-swift-fans-push-her-to-sue-donald-trump-as-she-is-busy-planning-her-future-with-travis-kelce/articleshow/125132415.cms,"Taylor Swift fans are demanding legal action against President Trump after a White House TikTok used her song ""The Fate of Ophelia"" with his images. The clip's unauthorized use of Swift's music, especially given her protective stance on her work and past criticisms of Trump, has sparked a copyright debate.

Swifties’ outrage over the White House TikTok isn’t just stan culture — it raises a real copyright test

More coverage on NFL:

Taylor Swift fans are spiraling and this time, it’s not over a breakup rumor or a hidden Easter egg. Swifties are demanding that the world’s most commercially powerful pop star take direct legal action against President Donald Trump after a White House TikTok set to “The Fate of Ophelia” started circulating on Monday.The clip, which paired Swift’s chart-topping single with images of Trump including his mugshot, triggered a legal frenzy across social media. Swift has famously refused to soften her stance on Trump, he once posted “I HATE TAYLOR SWIFT” and she’s aggressively protective of her masters. That combination is turning this one TikTok into a national copyright flashpoint.To ordinary TikTok users, trending sounds come pre-cleared. To a government office? That’s a different universe. Legally, the White House is treated as a commercial entity on social media, meaning it would have needed sync clearance to use Swift’s song. And in Swift’s world, that approval isn’t rubber-stamped.Fans poured into the comments, dropping lines like: “TAYLOR SWIFT SUE THEM FOR USING YOUR SONG!” and “One freaking huge lawsuit on the horizon.”There are tools in Swift’s legal toolbox, her team could deliver a cease-and-desist or initiate a DMCA takedown, and if they wanted to go nuclear, they could sue the federal government outright.She’s done both offensive and defensive IP battles before. But the calculus is different here.A lawsuit against a sitting President would immediately become partisan, and Swift has publicly guarded her political image, even when endorsing Harris, she kept it measured: “The choice is yours to make.”So yes, the use appears legally shaky. Yes, fans want blood. But Swift’s brand, not her legal leverage, may be the deciding factor here. Only one person can pull this trigger and she hasn’t said a word yet.","A White House TikTok set to Taylor Swift's 'The Fate of Ophelia' started circulating on Monday.

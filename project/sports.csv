'I don't want to be a one-season wonder': Punjab Kings' Shashank Singh





Shashank Singh, in an exclusive interview with TimesofIndia.com, had given Shreyas Iyer a new moniker: Punjab Kings' ""captain fantastic."" ""He has his own swag, he has his own aura, and he backs his own instinct,"" Shashank, who had played with Iyer in age-group cricket in Mumbai, had to say about his IPL captain.On Sunday, in a rain-affected Qualifier 2, Shreyas Iyer displayed everything that Shashank was talking about. He didn't celebrate his half-century; he batted with surety, and it looked like he was calculating the chase in his mind. Chasing 204, Iyer, who is called 'sarpanch' (head of the village) by Punjab Kings fans, took charge. In the 13th over bowled by Reece Topley, Shreyas hammered a hat-trick of sixes, each better than the last one.Iyer (87 not out off 41 balls; 5x4s, 8x6s) guided Punjab Kings to their first IPL final in 11 years. Punjab Kings defeated Mumbai Indians by five wickets at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad.Punjab did get a flying start from Priyansh Arya (20 off 10 balls) and No. 3 Josh Inglis (38 off 21 balls). Inglis, especially, belted Bumrah for 20 runs in his first over. Not everyday does Bumrah get that kind of treatment.But Iyer found an able partner in Nehal Wadhera, who is called Ludhiana's Yuvraj Singh. Wadhera scored a counter-attacking 29-ball 48 and forged an 84-run stand for the fourth wicket in just 47 balls.Shreyas Iyer etched his name in the history books. He became the first IPL captain to take three different teams to the IPL finals. Iyer had led Delhi Capitals to the final in 2020, guided Kolkata Knight Riders to the title in 2024, and now has steered Punjab Kings. He is also the first captain to lead two different teams in successive finals.Not to forget, Mumbai Indians had never lost defending 200-plus, and now they've been knocked out doing so with an over to spare.Earlier, it looked like the Shreyas Iyer-led team had lost its steam after finishing top of the IPL points table. They were blown away by a red-hot Royal Challengers Bengaluru in Qualifier 1 at Mullanpur, and then they gave away too many freebies against Mumbai Indians in Qualifier 2.On Tuesday, they will have a chance to take revenge for the humiliation they had to face in front of their home crowd.Shreyas Iyer won the flip of the coin and, because of the weather, opted to field. The match was delayed for a couple of hours because of the rain, but it finally started, and there was no reduction in overs.Mumbai Indians rode on a power-packed start from Jonny Bairstow and Tilak Varma, and a late flourish by Naman Dhir, to post an imposing 203/6.Barring the first over bowled by Arshdeep Singh, the Punjab outfit looked completely at sea. They were wayward with the ball and abysmal in the field. If this was not enough, PBKS were later penalised for a slow over rate, and an extra fielder was brought into the circle for the last two overs.Rohit Sharma got a reprieve in the second over after Azmatullah Omarzai dropped a tough chance. It was not an easy catch as he had to back-pedal a long way to reach it; he got both hands to it but couldn't control it.The dropped catch didn't cost PBKS much, as Marcus Stoinis got the prized wicket and celebrated it by thumping his chest, which probably was the only time Punjab players celebrated with jubilation.Bairstow wasted no time in unleashing his trademark aggression. He took the attack to the Punjab bowlers right from the outset, peppering the boundary ropes and racing to 38 off just 24 deliveries. However, as the pitch began to grip and slow down, PBKS managed to claw their way back. Vyshak Vijaykumar gave the breakthrough, removing Bairstow with a knuckle ball.The experienced duo of Tilak Varma and Suryakumar Yadav steadied the ship. Their 72-run partnership for the third wicket came at a rapid pace. Both batters looked in control, mixing caution with aggression, before Punjab struck at a vital moment — right before and after the second strategic timeout.Yuzvendra Chahal, who was playing the match with an injection in his bowling hand, was sent on a leather hunt by Suryakumar Yadav, but the veteran spinner won the battle. Suryakumar kept playing the sweep shot against Chahal, but the leggie had the last laugh. It was pushed in the air a little; Suryakumar went down on his knee and slog-swept it, but didn't get the elevation, and Nehal Wadhera caught it near deep mid-wicket.In a sudden twist, both Suryakumar Yadav and Tilak Varma were dismissed for identical scores of 44, halting MI's momentum just when it looked like they would surge past 220.Naman Dhir's late blitz provided the final flourish. The swashbuckling batter smashed a quickfire 37 off just 18 balls, peppering the off-side and clearing the ropes to perfection. His knock ensured MI crossed the psychological 200-run mark.","Punjab Kings defeated Mumbai Indians by five wickets at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad.

Carlsen faltered in the endgame, allowing Gukesh to capitalise despite acknowledging his losing position. This win propelled Gukesh to third place in the standings, intensifying the competition as the tournament nears its conclusion.

Exclusive | Arjuna Awardee Vantika Agrawal: 'People still ask, 'Chess is fine, but what do you really do?''

D Gukesh stunned Magnus Carlsen in Round 6 of the Norway Chess tournament.





World Champion D Gukesh secured a remarkable victory against former World No. 1 Magnus Carlsen in Round 6 of Norway Chess, recovering from a losing position on Sunday, marking his first classical win over the Norwegian GM and becoming the second Indian player after R Praggnanandhaa to defeat Carlsen in this competition.Carlsen maintained control throughout most of the match, but faltered in the closing stages, allowing the 19-year-old Gukesh to capitalise and claim the win.After committing the blunder, Carlsen banged his fist on the board in frustration, shook hands in a hurry before leaving the room in visible frustration. Gukesh, left equally gobsmacked with the late turnaround, held his head in his hands.Later, Gukesh admitted he was shaking after the game and acknowledged, ""I don't know what happened.""Despite looking like Carlsen was headed towards a second win over Gukesh in the tournament, the Indian kept prolonging the game to survive. ""There wasn't much I could do. It was just clearly lost... luckily he got into a time scramble,"" he said. ""99 out of 100 times I would lose,"" but it was ""just a lucky day,"" he added.Gukesh further said, ""I mean, [it was] not the way I wanted it to be, but okay, I'll take it.""Former player and now commentator Susan Polger posted on X, ""Carlsen outplayed Gukesh, made massive blunder to lose a winning game!This is the biggest shock of the year! Carlsen rarely loses in classical chess, and he rarely commits big blunders.He was playing so well with the black pieces in round 6 in Norway against Gukesh. He had a winning position with more time on the clock.But Gukesh did not give up. He continued to fight and Carlsen's advantage slowly disappeared. Then when both were in time pressure, he made a huge blunder which cost him the game.T his has to be one of the most painful losses in his spectacular career. I am sure he is very angry with himself.""The victory propelled Gukesh to third place in the tournament standings with 8.5 points, positioning him just one point behind leaders Carlsen and American Fabiano Caruana.Gukesh's coach, Grandmaster Vishnu Prasanna, reflected on the victory: ""We have to give a lot of credit to Gukesh for his stubbornness and for his resourcefulness because I think he was aware that he was dead lost for so long, yet he kept kicking, he kept kicking, and the time went lower, the more chances he had to actually do something with the position. I don't think his intention was to win that, but yeah, I'm sure he is happy. ""The unexpected victory has intensified the competition as the tournament approaches its final rounds, with the battle for the top position becoming increasingly competitive.","D Gukesh stunned Magnus Carlsen in Round 6 of the Norway Chess tournament.

If they win that, DK is going to be unbearable. One season as coach/mentor, and he's won it.""Michael Atherton added to the conversation by drawing a parallel to a famous football celebration: ""He's unbearable at the best of times, he's going to be doubly unbearable.

And most importantly, it's a journey that's been filled with lots of highs and lows.""He further elaborated on his decision to join the coaching staff: ""But the trophy hadn't reached the shores of Bangalore yet.

Punjab Kings pacer Kyle Jamieson has revealed that head coach Ricky Ponting and captain Shreyas Iyer have maintained a relaxed team environment ahead of their crucial IPL 2025 Qualifier 2 match against Mumbai Indians , particularly following their eight-wicket loss to Royal Challengers Bengaluru in Qualifier 1 at Mullanpur.The upcoming match at Narendra Modi Stadium on Sunday will determine who faces RCB in Tuesday's final.

When the game gets closer, you can nitpick things a little bit more. With the nature of how that game went, you just go and flush it. That's what we've done over the last couple of days. We've got a great opportunity here tonight and focus on all the good stuff we've done over the course of the season and hope we can do that tonight.""Jamieson praised the leadership approach of Ponting and Iyer in handling high-pressure situations.""They keep it pretty relaxed and chilled out. There are obviously moments and times where the focus is on what's important and what we want to do but it's also very simple - try not to overcomplicate things.Both of them have been around high-profile games so often in their careers.

Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) mentor Dinesh Karthik has heaped praise on the new skipper Rajat Patidar , lauding the batter’s grounded nature and unchanged behaviour even after taking over the leadership reins of the franchise.Patidar, 32, was a surprise pick as RCB captain ahead of IPL 2025, especially given his limited captaincy experience — his most notable being leading Madhya Pradesh to the final of the 2024/25 Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy. Yet, according to Karthik, the responsibility hasn't altered Patidar's core character.""Rajat Patidar has been the biggest eye-opener for me in life,"" Karthik said on the second episode of RCB's Journey to the Finale.

Paris Saint-Germain - UEFA Champions League





Paris Saint-Germain winning the UEFA Champions League for the first time in its history puts an end to one of the longest searches for European glory. Established in 1970, the French side were yet to taste European success prior to the final at the Allianz Arena on Saturday. Luis Enrique and his men made easy work of Simone Inzaghi's Inter as they steamrolled the Italians 5-0 in the final. While PSG's victory tops off an exhilarating Champions League season, it wasn't just the Parisiens that put an end to their trophy drought.The 2024/25 season will be remembered as the year many teams across Europe put an end to their quest for silverware. With PSG being the latest addition to the list, teams like Tottenham Hotspur, Crystal Palace, Newcastle United and Bayern Munich's Harry Kane have all added trophies to their cabinets. Here's a closer look at how this year proved to be pivotal in the quest for silverware for several teams.Led by Ange Postecoglou from the dugout, Tottenham Hotspur were in the quest for a trophy to put an end to their excruciating 17-year search for silverware. Spurs, often mocked for their inability to claim trophies, further stacked the odds against their favour, when Postecoglou claimed that he 'usually wins trophies in his second season'.With an emphatic win over Premier League rivals Manchester United in the final, Spurs finally put an end to their search for a trophy. Brennan Johnson scored the winner in a narrow 1-0 win.The Eagles clinched a trophy for the first time in 120 years after a major upset in the FA Cup final. After losing twice in the final of the same competition, in 1990 and 2016, Palace beat Manchester City in the 2025 final 1-0 thanks to a goal from Eberechi Eze. The result meant that City went trophyless for the first time since 2016 and Palace claimed their first-ever FA Cup.Newcastle United claimed a major domestic trophy for the first time since 1955 as they beat Premier League champions Liverpool 2-1 in the final. Goals from Dan Burn and Alexander Isak ensured that the side managed by Eddie Howe put an end to the 70-year wait. The title triumph was Newcastle's first since the 1955 FA Cup win.In the same year Tottenham Hotspur won the UEFA Europa League, former club captain and current Bayern Munich striker Harry Kane also ended his search for a maiden career trophy. Despite joining the Bavarians last season, the Englishman ended his debut season in Germany without any trophy to show for it.However, after a dominant Bundesliga campaign in which he topped the goal scoring charts with 26 strikes, Bayern claimed back the German league title from Bayer Leverkusen, who ended Bayern's streak of 11 successive Bundesliga titles last season.Ever since the French side was taken over by the sovereign-wealth fund of Qatar in 2011, PSG has kept it a priority to get their hands on the UCL trophy. However, despite heavy spending and bringing in top talent from across Europe, the Parisiens kept falling short of the ultimate prize.Lionel Messi, Neymar Jr. and even Kylian Mbappe failed to bring European glory to the club. However, Luis Enrique's side, led by Ousmane Dembele in attack finally clinched the biggest club competition with a 5-0 win over Inter.","Paris Saint-Germain won the UEFA Champions League for the first time.

Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) fans recoiled in shock with a stunned silence after Barcelona pulled off a historic comeback in the second leg of their Champions League 2016/17 Round of 16 match. The Spanish giants became the first team in the European tournament's history to overturn a 4-0 deficit, defying odds of 200/1.""We lost everything in the closing minutes,"" said PSG manager Unai Emery. While Neymar delivered a performance for the ages, it was Barca manager Luis Enrique who maintained belief despite a scenario where the vast majority hardly gave the Spanish side a 1 percent chance of qualification. ""If they can score four goals, we can score six. Infinite things can happen,"" maintained Enrique, setting the stage for an extraordinary 6-1 comeback win.While Emery soon made his way out, the 'chokers tag' became ingrained in the club's identity. PSG never really managed to overcome the horrors of that night at Camp Nou, surrendering the momentum yet again in the 2018-19 edition of the Champions League. The French club pulled off a 2-0 win against Manchester United at Old Trafford in the first leg of their quarter-final.However, PSG again failed to get the job done in the second leg, losing 1-3 and crashing out. Even the presence of Neymar, who was signed from Barcelona for a record sum, as well as Kylian Mbappe, proved insufficient.While PSG's fortunes in the Champions League did improve over the years, reaching the tournament's final in the 2019-20 edition, inability to hold on under pressure stood out like a sore thumb. Mbappe and Neymar failed to convert chances as Bayern Munich pulled off a clinical win. While PSG owner Nasser Al-Khelaifi had made the club's desire to win the Champions League amply clear, fortune simply failed to swing in their favour despite the addition of Lionel Messi.PSG's tendency to commit harakiri remained constant in the 2021/22 edition, especially during their Round of 16 match against Real Madrid. The French club leaked three goals in 17 minutes, crashing out of the competition following a 2-3 loss on aggregate.As the managerial merry-go-round continued, Khelaifi took a drastic and controversial decision by appointing Enrique as the manager at the start of the 2023/24 season. The move was certainly unpopular among the PSG fans, considering the Spaniard's 'persona non grata' status after the pain he had subjected them to. Well, who can begrudge unwillingness to face your worst nightmare on a daily basis?Enrique stamped his philosophy from the first day itself, terming the situation at PSG ""chaotic"" and shocking. While managers had previously been quite cautious while dealing with Mbappe, the Spaniard openly highlighted his lack of desire to defend. ""A little bit more normalcy does no harm,” said Enrique.There was complete focus on work rate, with players dropped irrespective of their profile in case of any drop in standards. While players and agents earlier attempted to manipulate the manager through external pressure, none of that worked in this case, as Enrique strongly went about his philosophy. Young talents like Willian Pacho, Desire Doue, Bradley Barcola, and Vitinha made their way in as PSG shifted their focus from the biggest names to building a strong core.The Spaniard won over fans by giving Barcelona a taste of their own medicine in the 2023/24 quarter-finals. PSG overturned a 2-3 deficit by recording a comprehensive 4-1 win in the second leg, as the Parisians pulled off their own 'La Remontada'. However, there was more work in store for Enrique as he soon realised following a 2-0 loss on aggregate against Borussia Dortmund in the semi-finals. PSG hit the woodwork six times but failed to score a single goal.There was further an unexpected blow in store for Enrique as Mbappe forced a move to Real Madrid, depriving the Parisians of their top goal-scorer. While other managers would've been perturbed, the former Barcelona manager remained nonplussed. ""Our game does not consist in letting Mbappé do what he wants. That was the old philosophy which never won a major trophy. We are better in attack without him,"" he said.While such strong words could have made him a laughing stock, Enrique went about rebuilding with gusto, building a strong setup around attackers Ousmane Dembele, Goncalo Ramos and Doué. Dembele found his feet after being sidelined at Barcelona, scoring 33 goals in 45 matches this season. While PSG reached the Champions League 2024/25 final against Inter Milan, who'd been beaten only once the entire season, naysayers predicted them to perish yet again.However, Enrique's side showcased a strong display of intent, recording the biggest win in a Champions League final with five goals. PSG finally managed to win the Champions League for the first time, pulling off a feat which had seemed jinxed at one stage. Doue chipped in with a brace while another young prospect Senny Mayulu scored the final goal, showcasing the wealth of talent in PSG's kitty. Enrique wept tears of joy, having gifted everlasting peace to the PSG fans after tormenting them for eight years.",Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) have struggled in the Champions League.

We will meet to hear what he has to say, I repeat, on our part, we are very proud and honoured to continue with him,"" he said.Inter suffered a devastating loss at the hands of Paris Saint-Germain in the final of the UEFA Champions League on Saturday at the Allianz Arena in Munich. The Parisiens put five past the Italian giants in a heavily one-sided final, as the Nerazzurri looked helpless against a relentless PSG onslaught.Following the result, Italian media reported that Inzaghi could depart as early as this month, ahead of the Club World Cup in the United States, scheduled from June 14 to July 13. However, Inter Milan president Giuseppe Marotta has confirmed the club wants to retain the manager despite Saturday's result, with discussions set to begin this week. Inzaghi's contract with the club expires next year in June.PSG claimed their first-ever Champions League title with the largest winning margin ever seen in a final. On the other hand, Inzaghi's Inter fell in the final once again, with the score line far worse than the 1-0 loss to Pep Guardiola's Manchester City in Istanbul in 2023.""This defeat will not have an impact.

IPL 2025 Winner Prediction: What Greenstone Lobo's Astrology says

Poll Should Inter Kashi continue their appeal at the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS)? Yes, they deserve another hearing. No, the decision should stand.





The I-League title race has taken another turn after the AIFF appeals committee adjudged that Inter Kashi fielded an ineligible player for multiple games in the second leg of the competition.The appeals committee heard an appeal from Churchill Brothers, Namdhari FC and Real Kashmir, and ruled that the re-registration of Mario Barco by Inter Kashi made him an ineligible player. “The rules do not provide for re-registration for anyone who has been ousted from the season due to a season ending injury/illness,” chairperson of appeals committee Rajesh Tandon said in the order on Saturday.The appeals committee had earlier rejected Kashi’s plea against Namdhari fielding an ineligible player to announce Churchill as champions. Kashi have challenged the decision at the Lausanne-based Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) where the matter is expected to be decided later this month.In the provisional standings, Churchill had 40 points, a point more than Kashi, while Real Kashmir were third with 37 points. The appeals committee order means Kashi’s games where Mario was fielded would result in forfeiture. Churchill will now get two additional points, taking their points tally to an unassailable 42, regardless of the pending appeal before CAS.“Churchill Brothers, with 42 points, are the undisputed champions,” Churchill said on Tuesday. “After this order, Churchill’s championship win has been affirmed. The I-League trophy will continue to be in Goa. Churchill Brothers are grateful to the judicial bodies as they have rightfully upheld our legitimate claims.”Kashi said they would appeal against the judgement at CAS, just like they have done with the previous order where three points allotted to them by the disciplinary committee were returned to Namdhari by the appeals committee.“While it is unfortunate that Inter Kashi has to approach CAS yet again for a truly free and fair hearing of the matter, it seems to be the new reality of Indian football. The club is flabbergasted that such simple rules and regulations can be twisted and misinterpreted in such a manner through which the club is now suffering without any fault of its own,” Kashi said in a statement.Records suggest that Mario was part of Kashi’s initial squad – which included six foreigners -- for the I-League but was later replaced by Matija Babovic due to what was seen as a season-ending injury. The Spanish striker, however, continued to remain contracted with the club and made a return to the team on Feb 26, 2025 since Julen Perez’s contract termination during the January transfer window left a vacant foreign spot.According to the order, the federation’s competitions department disallowed Kashi from re-registering Mario on Feb 2, insisting that the request did not comply with clause 6.5.7 of the I-League regulations which states that a foreign player can only be replaced by another foreign player in case an injury or illness prevents the player from continuing to play for the rest of the competition or after mutual termination of the contract.Kashi appealed the decision with the AIFF League Committee which said on Feb 15 that a majority of its members were in favour of approving the club's request to add back player Mario Barco.Kashi fielded Mario for their games starting Feb 26 against Rajasthan United.In its order, the appeals committee said there is no power of review available with the League Committee in I-League regulations. “A power not available in a statute cannot be exercised by a body which itself is a creature of the statute,” the order noted.“The unlawful inclusion of a foreign player provided Inter Kashi with an unfair advantage over other clubs adhering to the prescribed regulations,” stated the order. “Such a violation directly undermines the principles of fair play and the integrity of the I-League. Furthermore, not penalising such a violation would encourage resource-wealthy clubs to buy and rotate more foreign players in their squads. This would directly undermine the principles of equity and equal opportunities which has made the I-League one of the most renowned football leagues of this country till now. ”",Churchill Brothers will be allotted two additional points after Inter Kashi fielded ‘ineligible’ Mario Barco in their draw against the former champions at Raia Panaji.

In Formula E, a double-header means double the thrill—and fans make sure they don’t miss a moment. Taking place over a weekend, these back-to-back races offer spectators twice the action, twice the drama, and twice the excitement.

Representing DS Techeetah, he clinched victories during the first of three double-headers in Berlin in 2020. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the final six races of the season were held in Berlin, making da Costa’s consistency even more remarkable.Jaguar TCS Racing’s Mitch Evans had a slow start to the 2022 season, scoring just one point from the first three races. But he turned things around dramatically in Rome, where he dominated the weekend, starting from ninth and powering through to victory. He capped it off with a stunning lead of 5.703 seconds in one of the races.Also Read: Revisiting Antonio Felix Da Costa’s epic high-altitude pool dive after his Monaco E-Prix win Pascal Wehrlein delivered one of the most impressive double-header wins in recent memory.

As the courtside clock closed in on an hour of match time, the capacity crowd at Suzanne Lenglen erupted into a joyous celebration. The French Open third-round clash was a dozen games old and spectators were showing appreciation generally reserved for the winner of a close contest.World No. 1 Jannik Sinner had pulled away to a dominant 6-0, 5-0 lead when Jiri Lehecka, the world No. 34, stopped his opponent’s run of games and opened his account on the scoreboard. It was that kind of a performance from the three-time Major winner, clean as a whistle.“It was like I was playing against myself, he was two times better than me in everything,” said Lehecka, who was left shaking his head for a good part of the match.The 23-year-old had nine unforced errors and 31 winners while going full throttle, coming through 6-0, 6-1, 6-2 in one hour and 35 minutes.That level of dominance against a fellow 23-year-old, who was ranked in the top-25 three months ago, should force organizers to think twice before scheduling the Italian for a night match. A 95-minute game wouldn’t cut for the paying public, would it?The reason why men play most, if not all, the night matches at Roland Garros is because there’s a chance women’s matches could go quickly — too quickly.Sinner, who improved to 15-1 on the season, won 29 of 35 points on his first serve and 17 of 20 on the second serve as the skies went from cloudy to clear in the course of their time on court.Sinner, who returned earlier this month from a three-month ban for testing positive for Clostebol, may be short of matches but he’s looking fresher at a time when players are already complaining of fatigue barely five months into the season.“Sometimes in these kinds of matches (things) can change quickly, if you don’t start well in one set the match can go long, and then you cannot control it. We saw that on occasions here,” Sinner said, perhaps alluding to Carlos Alcaraz’s third-round clash against Damir Dzumhur.The Bosnian surprised the defending champion in the third set on Friday night and broke the world No. 2 in the second game of the fourth set, then taking a handy 3-1 lead.“You have to focus and (have the) level always very, very high, because unexpected things can happen. Jiri is an amazing player. He has shown that throughout his career.”Sinner admitted to feeling good at practice this morning, but didn’t think form necessarily transcribed to a match court — especially given the vagaries of the conditions players have been dealing with this past week.“I try to control whatever I can, and today I did that,” he said. “This morning I felt the ball very good, but conditions can change from one moment to another.”The 6ft 3in Italian will meet Russian Andrey Rublev in the fourth round on Monday. Sinner leads the head-to-head 6-3, having won four of their last five meetings.Rublev advanced to the fourth round after a walkover from home favourite Arthur Fils, who withdrew because of a stress fracture of the lower back.","World No. 1 Jannik Sinner beat Jiri Lehecka 6-0, 6-1,6-2 in one hour and 35 minutes.

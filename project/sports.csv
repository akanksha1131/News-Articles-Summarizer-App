Poll Do you believe India can secure a win in the final ODI against Australia? Yes, definitely Probably Probably not

NEW CHANDIGARH: Inspired by peerless Smriti Mandhana’s scintillating 77-ball century - the fastest-ever against Australia in WODIs - India finally slayed their Aussie demons, ending their eight-match losing streak against the seven-time world champions in grand style with a thumping 102-run victory in the second WODI at the Maharaja Yadavindra Singh International Cricket Stadium in Mullanpur on Wednesday night. It is the heaviest defeat margin Australia have ever suffered in a WODI, and it ended their 13-match win streak in this format.It was India’s first victory over Australia in a WODI at home in 18 years, with the last one coming way back in 2007. India’s last win over the Aussies in WODIs came four years ago - on Sept 26, 2021 at Mackay. The magical comeback win also ensured that India equalised the series 1-1, with the third and final ODI in Delhi on Sept 20 now a blockbuster decider. The resounding win against Australia, coming on the back of a successful tour of England, will also boost India’s morale ahead of the 2025 Women’s ODI World Cup, which kicks off on Sept 30 in Guwahati.Fired by Mandhana’s glorious 91-ball 117, which included 14 sweetly-timed fours and four huge sixes and lit up the stadium, India posted a challenging total of 292 in 49.5 overs. Putting in a vastly improved display in the field, even though they again dropped a few catches, India then bowled out Australia for 190 in merely 40.4 overs.Bouncing back from a poor show on Sunday night when India lost by eight wickets in the first WODI, impressive young seamer Kranti Goud took three for 29, including the final wicket, in 9.5 overs of incisive bowling, while off-s[pinner Deepti Sharma, who had earlier contributed a vital 40 (53b, 2x4), took two for 24 in six overs. The icing on the cake was pacer Arundhati Reddy’s three superb catches in the deep, a fine catch by skipper Harmanpreet Kaur at extra cover to send back Annabel Sutherland (45, 42b, 4x4) and the brilliant caught and bowled grab by Radha Yadav to send back Alysse Perry for 44 (61b, 5x4).Choosing to dump their strategy of playing four spinners, India decided to play three seamers instead, bringing in an extra bowler in Reddy, while dropping left-arm spinner Shree Charani, in the mix. It helped India that the visitors rested explosive opener Phoebe Litchfield, who cracked 88 off 80 balls in the first WODI, choosing to give game time to Georgia Voll.Clearly, Madhana, who’s currently in blazing form, is set to be the biggest key for India in the 2025 Women’s ODI World Cup, which kicks off on Sept 30 in Guwahati. However, there are a few concerns for India going into the mega tournament too.In the morning, it emerged that middle-order batter Jemimah Rodrigues had been ruled out of the remaining two matches of the series due to viral fever, even as Mandhana’s sizzling show with the bat helped the team overcome that setback. Seasoned pacer Renuka Singh Thakur finally returned from her long injury lay-off to play her first WODI in almost nine months, but, troubled by cramps/hamstring, couldn’t bowl further after taking one for 28 in 6.3 overs.Another slight worry for India is the form of captain Harmanpreet Kaur, who sliced Australian off-spinner Ashleigh Gardner to backward point after making 17 off 26 balls. The 36-year-old has scored 28 runs in two matches in this series.Earlier, dominating the Aussie attack, Mandhana broke several records en route to her 12th WODI hundred, reaching the landmark with a lofted six over mid-off off Tahlia McGrath in the 29th over. The previous-fastest century against Australia in WODIs was hit by England’s Nat Sciver (off 79 balls in the 2022 World Cup match at Hamilton).The 29-year-old also thrashed the second-fastest century by an Indian woman in ODIs, interestingly only behind her own 70-ball hundred against Ireland in Rajkot earlier this year in January. This was Mandhana’s third WODI hundred this year-she had stroked four centuries last year.Mandhana, who reclaimed the No 1 ranking in WODIs when she stroked 58 off 63 balls in the first match of the series, thus equaled the record for most women’s ODI centuries by an opener. The elegant southpaw equalled New Zealand’s Suzie Bates and England’s Tammy Beaumont with her 12th century in 106 innings as an opener for India since her debut in 2013.Overall, Mandhana stands joint-third on the WODI century-makers’ list, with only Meg Lanning (15) and Bates (13) ahead of her. This was Mandhana’s third WODI hundred against Australia, the most by any Asian batter in WODIs against them. She has now scored 15 international hundreds, again the most by an Asian batter in international women’s cricket.","India beat Australia by 102 runs in second ODI in Mullanpur.

"India's new T20 approach: Floaters, flexibility, and Suryakumar Yadav's adaptability",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/asia-cup/indias-new-t20-approach-floaters-flexibility-and-suryakumar-yadavs-adaptability/articleshow/123936840.cms,"Suryakumar Yadav of India (Photo by Francois Nel/Getty Images)

How's the mood in Team India after handshake row and Pakistan threats?

Suryakumar Yadav on no handshake with Pakistan: 'Some things in life are ahead of sportsmanship'

Dubai: Before the start of the Asia Cup , there were apprehensions about how India’s batting would hold up in the post-Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli era. There was also concern that Suryakumar Yadav — India’s only true 360-degree batter, with a career strike rate near 170 — would be under tremendous pressure to keep the tempo high, taking significant risks in the process.The fear was simple. If the India T20 captain got out early, India’s scoring rate might nosedive because no one else could replicate his strike rotation and boundary-hitting frequency. India, it seemed, lacked a second ultra-aggressive middle-order option in the mould of Australia’s Glenn Maxwell or England’s Harry Brook.Opposition teams often plan specifically to dismiss Surya early. When they succeed, India have historically tended to finish with below-par totals. On slow pitches like those in the UAE, expecting one batter to carry the middle overs alone is a risky bet. The game against Pakistan, however, offered a glimpse of a new India — one that seems to have a well-laid-out strategy for all surfaces.“The management has told everyone in the team that apart from the openers, all batters should be flexible — anyone can bat anywhere depending on the situation. In T20 cricket, if you are playing with seven batters, everyone has to make a small impact.That’s what makes a team dangerous,” Surya said after India’s seven-wicket win on Sunday.This tactical approach mirrors what England successfully implemented during their 2022 T20 World Cup triumph — when players like Moeen Ali, Liam Livingstone, and Ben Stokes frequently floated up or down the order based on match-ups and game situation. The idea was simple: put the right batter in at the right time, not just follow a fixed batting order.With Abhishek Sharma and Shubman Gill providing brisk starts, Surya can now afford to dial down his risk-taking when required. Against Pakistan, he did exactly that — compiling a measured 47 off 37 balls to steer the chase. Tilak Varma at No. 4 adds left-handed balance and clean hitting on both sides of the wicket, while Hardik Pandya at No. 5 can either rebuild or launch, depending on the match situation. Add to that a set of floaters like Shivam Dube, Sanju Samson , and Axar Patel, and India suddenly have a middle order that isn’t as one-dimensional as before.“Pressure is always there when you play against any team — but that’s where the fun is. If you don’t have butterflies, you won’t enjoy overcoming them once you step on the ground,” Surya reflected. India’s batting numbers may still fluctuate, he admitted, but the approach is clear.Before Sunday, Surya’s highest score against Pakistan was just 18. But after India lost Gill and Abhishek midway through the chase, he took control of the game by building a crucial 56-run partnership with Varma. It showed he was willing to curb his natural instincts for the team’s cause.Surya acknowledged that his numbers against Pakistan weren’t great but stressed he was working on improving them. “If something goes up and down, it’s okay. We go back to the drawing board and try to do better next time. But today, it felt good to stay there till the end — that was important,” he said.",There were apprehensions about how India’s batting would hold up in the post- Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli era.

Handshake drama becomes ugly! India vs Pakistan Asia Cup 2025 in DANGER?

Dubai: Cricket’s latest flashpoint is threatening to overshadow the Asia Cup. For the second straight day, uncertainty loomed large as Pakistan pushed for the removal of match referee Andy Pycroft following the post-match handshake controversy with India — a demand that sources say the International Cricket Council (ICC) refused to entertain.The controversy erupted after India’s seven-wicket win in a Group A clash on Sunday when Indian players skipped the customary handshake and even shut the dressing-room door on their rivals.Mohsin Naqvi — the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chairman who is also the president of the Asian Cricket Council (ACC) and the country’s federal interior minister — took to social media to express his displeasure, calling the snub “against the spirit of the game”.“The PCB lodged a complaint with the ICC regarding violations by the match referee of the ICC code of conduct and the MCC laws pertaining to the spirit of cricket. The PCB demanded an immediate removal of the match referee from the Asia Cup,” Naqvi posted on X.The complaint, lodged through team manager Naveed Cheema, accused Pycroft of instructing Pakistan captain Salman Ali Agha not to shake hands with his Indian counterpart ahead of the toss.Adding to the drama, reports in Pakistani media claimed that PCB sacked its director of international cricket operations, Usama Wahla, for not reacting quickly enough when the controversy broke. Some reports even suggested Wahla’s dismissal was partly due to allowing pacer Shaheen Shah Afridi to collect the post-match award after the presentation was boycotted by captain Salman Ali Agha.The ICC has so far refrained from making a public statement but sources confirmed that Pakistan’s demand was turned down. An ICC official told TOI that removing a match referee on a team’s request would “set a wrong precedent” and undermine the independence of match officials. The decision was reportedly conveyed to the PCB on Monday night.India, too, have had their share of run-ins with match referees in the past, though the ICC has traditionally backed its officials, barring the 2008 ‘Monkeygate’ controversy when Steve Bucknor was reluctantly replaced by Billy Bowden for the third Test in Perth.Some Pakistani outlets reported that the PCB was now seeking face-saving measures, including a request for former West Indies captain Ritchie Richardson to officiate their remaining matches in place of the 69-year-old Pycroft.PCB’s strained relationship with Pycroft is not new. The former Zimbabwe batter previously reported some of their players — including Shoaib Malik, Saeed Ajmal and Mohammad Hafeez — for suspect bowling actions.Meanwhile, Pakistan’s pre-match press conference ahead of their must-win clash against UAE in Dubai was cancelled without explanation, adding to the intrigue. Their training session at the ICC Academy, however, went ahead as planned, overlapping with India’s session on Monday evening. Both teams trained on the same campus but on separate grounds.Pakistan now find themselves in a do-or-die situation. A defeat to a charged-up UAE side could see them crash out early. They are currently second in the standings with two points from their first two matches — one win and one loss — holding a slim edge over their rivals.Pakistan’s reported threat to pull out from the Asia Cup won’t be particularly easy to carry out, as any such move could result in a revenue loss of anything between $12 to $16 million for the country. Five Test-playing nations — India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Afghanistan — earn 15% each, constituting 75% of the ACC’s annual revenue. The remaining 25% is shared by associate nations.",Pakistan's pre-match press conference cancelled without explanation.

Poll Do you think India was justified in objecting to Mike Denness's decisions during the 2001 Test series? Yes, the penalties were unfair No, the referee acted appropriately

A major moment in cricket’s power dynamics erupted in November 2001 when India, with the backing of South Africa, forced the removal of International Cricket Council (ICC) match referee Mike Denness. In light of the move, the Centurion Test was branded unofficial.The dispute followed the second Test in Port Elizabeth, where Denness sanctioned six Indian players, including captain Sourav Ganguly and Sachin Tendulkar, for breaches of the code of conduct. India objected strongly, arguing the penalties were unjust, and requested his removal for the next match.Despite negotiations, the ICC refused to intervene, and Denness declined to step aside voluntarily. In response, the United Cricket Board of South Africa (UCBSA) announced that Denis Lindsay would officiate as referee for the third Test at Centurion.In its statement, the UCBSA said, “South African cricket and the South African public in general cannot afford the cancellation of this Test match… The South African Government, through Sports Minister Ngconde Balfour, has instructed the UCBSA to take whatever action is necessary to ensure that the Test match goes ahead.”The board confirmed that chief executive Gerald Majola had informed ICC chief Malcolm Speed that Denness would not be allowed access to the referee’s position at the ground.The Centurion match, played from November 23, 2001, went ahead with Lindsay as referee. South Africa piled up 566 for 8 declared, while India made 232 and 261, falling to an innings defeat. It remained classified as 'unofficial'.","India wanted Mike Dennes removed as match umpire for their 3rd unofficial Test against South Africa back in 2001.

Umpire Ruchira Palliyaguruge makes his way off the field after being hit (Screengrab)

Play was briefly halted in Dubai on Wednesday after on-field umpire Ruchira Palliyaguruge was struck on the ear by a throw during the Asia Cup Group A clash between Pakistan and the UAE.The incident occurred in the sixth over of UAE’s chase when a throw back to the bowler caught the Sri Lankan umpire on the left ear. Palliyaguruge, who had his back turned, looked visibly dazed as Pakistan fielders immediately rushed to his aid. The team physio was called, and after a short delay the reserve umpire took the field in his place.Earlier, Pakistan posted 146 for 9 in their 20 overs after being asked to bat first, a total that owed much to Fakhar Zaman’s counterattacking 50 off 36 balls and a late cameo from Shaheen Shah Afridi. Afridi smashed an unbeaten 29 from 14 deliveries, including two sixes, to lift the innings from collapse.UAE’s bowlers dominated the innings, with Junaid Siddique returning figures of 4 for 18 and Simranjeet Singh Kang adding 3 for 18 to keep Pakistan to an achievable total for UAE. Pakistan’s top order faltered again, with Saim Ayub dismissed for his third successive duck in the tournament and Abdullah Shafique also losing his wicket cheaply.Chasing 147 to secure qualification to the Super Four, UAE’s innings was disrupted early by Pakistan’s spinners. Saim Ayub struck in his first over while Abrar Ahmed also removed UAE captain Muhammad Waseem in his opening spell to raise his team's hopes.With both sides under pressure, the unexpected injury to the umpire added another twist to an already dramatic contest that was delayed by an hour and even was under threat of a Pakistan boycott ahead of its start.",Ruchira Palliyaguruge was struck on the ear by a throw during the Asia Cup Group A clash between Pakistan and the UAE.

PCB's official statement on X (Screengrab)

The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has issued a statement that International Cricket Council (ICC) match referee Andy Pycroft apologised to the national team’s captain and manager after the controversial “no-handshake” incident during the India-Pakistan Asia Cup clash on September 14.In a statement, the PCB said Pycroft admitted the decision to prevent the customary handshake between the two captains was a result of “miscommunication.” It added that the official had “apologized to the manager and captain of the Pakistani cricket team” for the episode.The board, however, maintained that it had strongly objected to Pycroft’s handling of the matter and had formally appealed to the ICC to replace him as referee for Pakistan’s following fixture against the United Arab Emirates. That request was turned down.Prior to the start of the game, Pakistan skipper Salman Ali Agha did not shake hands with Pycroft, unlike UAE skipper Muhammad Waseem.“The ICC has expressed its readiness to investigate the violation of the Code of Conduct during the match on September 14,” the PCB statement added, stressing the governing body’s willingness to review the sequence of events.The controversy escalated further on Wednesday when Pakistan’s game against the UAE was delayed by an hour in Dubai after uncertainty over the team’s participation.Players were 'stopped' from boarding the team bus at their hotel even after their kit bags had been loaded, while the Asian Cricket Council deleted its posts for the match, adding to the speculation of a potential boycott.Despite Pycroft’s apology, the ICC said that an internal inquiry had already cleared him of wrongdoing, noting he had in fact acted to “help prevent potential embarrassment for both captains” by communicating the organisers’ decision. It also stressed that match official appointments are centralised and “cannot be influenced by considerations of any member board.”The PCB’s position, however, remains in an awkward spot, given that they have acknowledged Pycroft’s apology while also signalling dissatisfaction that their appeal for his replacement was rejected. This leaves the team caught in a controversy just before a crucial Asia Cup tie.","Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has issued a statement that Andy Pycroft apologised to the national team’s captain and manager after the controversial “no- handshake” incident during the India-Pakistan Asia Cup clash on September 14.

Poll Should the ICC reconsider the appointment of match officials based on member board objections? Yes No

The Asia Cup fixture between Pakistan and the UAE in Dubai was thrown into uncertainty on Wednesday evening, with the start delayed by an hour and strong indications that Pakistan could forfeit the match.The controversy arose from Pakistan’s objection to Andy Pycroft continuing as match referee. The ICC had earlier looked into the matter and cleared Pycroft of any misconduct, ruling that “appointment of match officials is a centralised ICC decision and it can't be influenced by considerations of any member board.”As per reports, Pycroft was present at the stadium before later leaving for the ICC headquarters. Meanwhile, the Pakistan team was stopped from travelling to the ground despite their kit bags already being loaded onto the bus. The UAE side, however, had reached the venue on schedule.More recently, ACC President and PCB chairman Mohsin Naqvi has tweeted on X that the Pakistan side has been asked to depart for the Dubai Cricket stadium.As per latest updates, the UAE-Pakistan match will commence at 7:30PM local time (9:00PM IST).

Poll Which aspect of the ISPL initiative do you find most promising? Talent identification Financial support for tournaments Decentralised governance

In a significant step for tennis-ball cricket, the Indian Street Premier League (ISPL) has rolled out a structured national framework aimed at enhancing grassroots development and creating a direct pathway for emerging talent across India.The initiative divides the country into eight administrative zones, each managed by an ISPL-recognised panel or federation. These panels will govern cricketing activities in their respective regions and oversee talent identification and development.Legendary cricketer and ISPL Core Committee Member Sachin Tendulkar said, “Identifying talent at the grassroots is the first step to building a strong future for the game. With ISPL’s new national framework, players from every corner of India now have a clear pathway to nurture their skills and showcase their talent on a bigger stage. This structure ensures every player gets a fair chance to be noticed and progress, turning their love for the game into real opportunities at the national level. ”The zones are as follows:Franchise owners of ISPL teams representing these regions will act as chairpersons of the panels. Alongside them will be local operations teams, scouting leads and representatives from affiliated tournaments.A key feature of the framework is the affiliation of local tournaments.Organisers can apply for official recognition through the ISPL’s website or app. Once approved, the tournaments become part of the ISPL ecosystem, gaining access to shared branding, player pipelines and financial support.The financial model has been structured to empower both organisers and zones. Each tournament can register up to 5,000 players, with both team and individual entries permitted.Ashish Shelar, also part of the ISPL Core Committee, said, “Establishing robust structures within sports is essential to strengthening the entire sporting ecosystem and ensuring sustainable growth. The ISPL’s comprehensive zonal panel model sets a high benchmark not only for tennis-ball cricket but also for sporting economies across the country. By promoting transparency, accountability and regional development, ISPL is laying a solid foundation that will elevate the sport and empower aspiring athletes nationwide. ”Player registration fees will be split equally between tournament organisers and zone owners. Organisers will retain 100% of sponsorship revenue, while winners and runners-up of affiliated tournaments will be awarded prize money of ₹5 lakh and ₹3 lakh respectively.Funds directed to zonal owners will be used for ground development and grassroots programs, with ISPL itself keeping no share of the registration fees.With decentralised governance, financial empowerment for local tournaments and a clear route for talent progression, the ISPL’s competitive national framework is being framed as a gamechanger for grassroots cricket in the country.","The Indian Street Premier League (ISPL) has rolled out a structured national framework aimed at enhancing grassroots development.

Poll Was Liverpool's late win against Atletico Madrid a show of tactical brilliance? Yes, absolutely! No, it was luck.

Title-holder Paris Saint-Germain roared to victory in the Champions League on Wednesday, while Liverpool once again left it late to continue their stunning start to the season.At the Parc des Princes, PSG dismantled Atalanta 4-0 with style and confidence. Even Bradley Barcola’s missed penalty did little to dent the champions’ dominance, as coach Luis Enrique praised his players: “It’s a joy to see such a performance. I think our fans can be happy.”Nuno Mendes got on the scoresheet in the second half after Khvicha Kvaratskhelia lit up the night with a dazzling solo goal just before halftime. With Ousmane Dembélé sidelined, PSG are already campaigning for him in the upcoming Ballon d’Or awards in Paris, though Mendes and Achraf Hakimi also strengthened their claims.At Anfield, Liverpool survived another nerve-shredding finish in a 3-2 win over Atletico Madrid. Early goals from Andy Robertson and Mohamed Salah had the hosts cruising, but Marcos Llorente — who famously knocked Liverpool out in 2020 — struck twice, in first-half stoppage time and the 81st minute, to level the match. Yet the Reds had one more twist to deliver. In the 92nd minute, Virgil van Dijk rose highest to head in Dominik Szoboszlai’s corner, sealing a dramatic victory.Coach Arne Slot admitted, “We should have made it easier for ourselves.”Elsewhere, Bayern Munich avenged their 2012 final heartbreak by beating Chelsea 3-1 in Munich. Harry Kane scored twice, while Cole Palmer grabbed a fine consolation for the visitors. Inter Milan also enjoyed European nostalgia, defeating Ajax 2-0 in Amsterdam with a Marcus Thuram brace — echoing their revenge for losing the 1972 European Cup final to the Dutch giants.The debutants also made their presence felt. Norway’s Bodo/Glimt staged a late comeback to draw 2-2 at Slavia Prague. Having missed a penalty and trailing 2-0, Kasper Høgh pulled one back before substitute Sondre Brunstad Fet smashed in a stunning equaliser in the 90th minute. Goalkeeper Nikita Haikin then preserved the point with a stoppage-time save.Cypriot side Pafos earned a gritty 0-0 draw at Olympiakos despite being reduced to 10 men after Bruno Felipe’s dismissal in the 26th minute. Veteran defender David Luiz limped off injured on his debut, but the team held firm to mark Cyprus’s first main-phase appearance since 2017.The competition continues Thursday with six more fixtures, including Manchester City hosting Napoli with Kevin De Bruyne set for a return, and Barcelona travelling to Newcastle without the injured Lamine Yamal.","Paris Saint-Germain thrashed Atalanta 4-0 at the Parc des Princes.

Shortly after, Ahal's Elman Tagayew struck the left post.The home side created another opportunity in the 37th minute through a combination between Samad and Jason Cummings, but the Scottish striker fired his shot high from inside the box.The second half saw increased pressure from Ahal FK. Berenov's attempt in the 52nd minute went astray, and five minutes later, Mohun Bagan goalkeeper Vishal Kaith made an impressive save to deny him again.Kaith continued his strong performance in the 69th minute, using his frame effectively to stop Berenow's attempt at the near post after Cummings' setup.The match intensity peaked in the 80th minute with Kaith making another crucial save to deny Mirzoyev's header.

Real Madrid opened their Champions League campaign with a narrow 2-1 win over Marseille at the Santiago Bernabeu, despite playing the closing stages with 10 men. Marseille stunned the home crowd when Timothy Weah put them ahead midway through the first half. Real equalised before the interval when Mbappe converted a penalty after Rodrygo was fouled in the box.The home side faced further trouble in the second half. Trent Alexander-Arnold was sidelined with an injury, and Dani Carvajal was sent off following a VAR review for a headbutt on Marseille goalkeeper Geronimo Rulli.Even with ten men, Real Madrid held on thanks to another Mbappe penalty, after Facundo Medina was penalised for handball. Mbappe, who reached 50 goals for the club, said, “For me it’s a penalty, but I understand there are people who don’t. We’re all lost with this rule.”Arsenal followed with a strong 2-0 away win against Athletic Bilbao. Gabriel Martinelli and Leandro Trossard, both substitutes, scored late in the game. Martinelli ran through to open the scoring in the 72nd minute, and Trossard sealed the victory with a deflected strike.“We started to grow throughout the game. In the second half, we were more fluent, dominant, and the finishers made the impact for us to win the game,” said coach Mikel Arteta. This was an ideal start for Arsenal, who lost to eventual champions Paris Saint-Germain in last season’s semi-finals.Tottenham Hotspur edged Villarreal 1-0 in North London, with the match decided by a farcical own goal from Villarreal goalkeeper Luiz Junior. Lucas Bergvall’s cross trickled into the net, giving Spurs the win. “It was a very even game that we just edged,” said manager Thomas Frank, as Tottenham continued their strong form under new leadership.Juventus and Borussia Dortmund delivered one of the most thrilling games of the night, finishing 4-4 in Turin. After a goalless first half, Karim Adeyemi put Dortmund ahead, but Kenan Yildiz equalised soon after.

Paris Saint-Germain begin their Champions League title defence against Atalanta on Wednesday, with concerns mounting over their squad's ability to handle an intense schedule following their historic triumph last season. The French champions, who played 65 games in 2024/25, are already facing injury challenges as they prepare for another demanding campaign that includes domestic competitions, European matches, and the FIFA Intercontinental Cup.PSG's European campaign includes matches against Bayern, Tottenham Hotspur, and Newcastle United in the group stage, along with away fixtures at Barcelona, Bayer Leverkusen, Athletic Bilbao, and Sporting Lisbon.The team's previous Champions League performance showed resilience despite early struggles, losing three of eight group stage matches before securing their first European title with a 5-0 victory over Inter Milan in Munich.The demanding schedule from last season has begun taking its toll. Ballon d'Or favorite Ousmane Dembele and Desire Doue are sidelined with muscle injuries from international duty, while Khvicha Kvaratskhelia, Lee Kang-in, and Lucas Beraldo suffered injuries in Sunday's 2-0 win against Lens.""It happens to everyone. It is a bit of a difficult time for us because we have a lot of players injured,"" said Luis Enrique, who himself is wearing an arm sling due to a cycling accident. ""I am calm about it and I hope we will manage to overcome it.""The club's squad management last season was effective, with nineteen players logging over 1,000 minutes, matching the rotation patterns of Real Madrid and Barcelona.The Club World Cup's demanding schedule, featuring matches in intense heat and extensive travel across the United States, proved particularly challenging. PSG utilized 19 players compared to Chelsea's 27, ultimately losing 3-0 in the final.This season could see PSG play at least 55 games if they advance in the Champions League, including December's FIFA Intercontinental Cup.Right-back Achraf Hakimi, who recorded the most minutes for PSG last season, faces additional commitments with Morocco's hosting of the Africa Cup of Nations in December and January.The club's transfer activity was minimal, adding only center-back Illia Zabarnyi and goalkeeper Lucas Chevalier, who replaced Gianluigi Donnarumma.""Injuries to high-profile players are only one visible part of the workload crisis facing professional football and are not surprising,"" stated FIFPro, the global players' union. ""The impact is not felt just by the players but increasingly also by clubs, national teams, fans and national competitions.""Despite these challenges, PSG's coach maintains optimism about their European campaign.""It is a special moment. We know how difficult this competition is, but we are relaxed about it and we are hoping to put in a good performance in our first game,"" Luis Enrique said.","Paris Saint-Germain begin their Champions League title defence against Atalanta on Wednesday.

Poll How do you feel about Manchester City's performance against Manchester United? Outstanding Solid Average

Manchester City cruised to a commanding 3-0 victory over rivals Manchester United on Sunday, with Erling Haaland scoring twice after Phil Foden’s opener at the Etihad Stadium.The result handed Pep Guardiola’s side a timely lift after back-to-back league defeats, while piling more pressure on United manager Ruben Amorim, whose team have now taken just four points from their first four games.City began strongly and made the breakthrough inside 20 minutes. Jeremy Doku’s persistence on the left allowed his cross to find an unmarked Foden to head home.After the restart, Haaland extended the advantage in trademark fashion, racing clear before lifting the ball calmly over Altay Bayindir. Moments later, the Norwegian spurned an open-goal chance when he rounded the goalkeeper but struck the post, keeping United faintly in the contest.Any hopes of a response were dashed by a standout moment from debutant Gianluigi Donnarumma, who clawed away Bryan Mbeumo’s volley at full stretch to preserve City’s two-goal cushion. Minutes later, Harry Maguire’s misplaced pass allowed Bernardo Silva to release Haaland, who finished emphatically to seal the points.The win keeps City six points behind leaders Liverpool but restores momentum ahead of a demanding week featuring fixtures against Napoli and Arsenal. For United, it was another disappointing derby day, with fans audibly expressing their frustration towards Amorim as chants of “sacked in the morning” echoed from the away section.The occasion was preceded by a solemn moment as both sets of supporters paid tribute to boxing great Ricky Hatton, who passed away earlier on Sunday. A lifelong City supporter, Hatton’s image was displayed during a minute’s applause.",Erling Haaland scored twice as Manchester City beat Manchester United 3-0 at the Etihad Stadium.

How Norman Nato spent his July

Norman Nato has been making the most of the long break after the end of Formula E Season 11. He was recently spotted chilling with Nissan teammate and Formula E championship winner Oliver Rowland. Nato has now shared a bunch of candid pictures to show a glimpse of how he spent July with his family, friends, and on the track. But it is his daughter who is the star of his post.Norman Nato shared the bunch of pictures with just a one-word caption: “July.” He did add emojis of a Formula E car, sun, octopus, lemon, and camera to hint at the July mohod. The star of the pictures was his baby girl, as he spent several candid moments with her, including one from the races.Car racer Will Stevens commented on the post, “Good collection this month.” Nato replied to him sarcastically, “First time you deserve to be in my carousel.” Another racer, Alex Lynn, wrote, “This love.” One more racer, Tom Blomqvist, commented, “Proud I made the cut.” Racer Sean Gelael wrote, “NN Style.”Nissan also reacted to the post with raising hands emojis.Norman Nato participates in both Formula E and the Endurance Championship.He races for Nissan in Formula E and had a disappointing season this time.

What’s common between the three Formula E world champions

How the three World Champions fared in Formula E Season 11

Days after Oliver Rowland lifted his Formula E World Championship trophy in London this season, an interesting trend has come to the attention of Formula E and its fans. As a coincidence, all Formula E drivers who won the Mexico City E-Prix went on to win the Formula E World Championship that season, and this has been proved right for three consecutive years.Highlighting the same since 2023, a poster of three World Champions was shared on X by Formula E with the caption, “The trend continues. Each winner of the #MexicoCityEPrix from the past three seasons has gone on to become World Champion.”The special poster features 2023 Formula E World Champion Jake Dennis from Andretti, then TAG Heuer Porsche’s Pascal Wehrlein, who won in 2024, and the new World Champion, Nissan driver Oliver Rowland. All three of them won in the Mexico E-Prix and went on to lift the winner’s trophy in the Formula E World Championship that year.Oliver Rowland had strengthened his chances of winning the Formula E World Championship this year much earlier. He was leading the Formula E Driver Standings ever since he won Part 2 of the Jeddah E-Prix, which was his second win of the season after winning the Mexico E-Prix. In the last leg, the Nissan driver got nervous for a while as Pascal Wehrlein, who was following him in the number two position, closed the gap after grabbing quite a few podiums while Rowland had a dull period.Things became serious for Rowland when he failed to finish the Round 13 race in Berlin, while Wehrlein won second spot on the podium. But he eventually managed to confirm his championship in Berlin after four wins and three more podiums.Sharing about his bad race in Berlin, Rowland had said, “I was hoping before the weekend that the outcome could be [the World Championship], but after yesterday (Saturday) and this morning (Sunday), I was more worried that it might never come.”Also Read: Oliver Rowland reacts to daughter’s sweet radio message after Formula E Championship win: “It’s amazing” Things, however, changed for Wehrlein, who was pushed to third position after Nick Cassidy made a late entry in the Formula E Driver Standings by registering three consecutive wins.

Wehrlein registered one win and five more podiums this season.Meanwhile, Andretti driver Jake Dennis finished in seventh position in the Formula E Driver Standings.

Taylor Barnard on losing top three spot in Formula E World Championship

Fans hail Taylor Barnard for his fantastic rookie season

We couldn’t have done it without you all — your trust and support have never been taken for granted,” he added.Praising the two McLaren drivers, he wrote, “Sam clinched McLaren’s first-ever fully electric win at the São Paulo E-Prix in Season 10, pulling off one of Formula E’s all-time great overtakes, before being waved across the line by none other than Emerson Fittipaldi – McLaren's first Formula 1 World Champion. While Taylor has been a rookie sensation in Season 11, securing five Formula E records, including the youngest driver to start a race, the youngest points scorer, the youngest driver to lead a lap, the youngest podium finisher, and the youngest polesitter. ”He ended the letter saying, “Some of us have been together since the day we first launched this team, while others have seamlessly fitted in along the way and flourished within the environment we have cultivated. For many, I am sure that we will cross paths again soon, but whatever the future holds for those here at Bicester, whatever path they choose to follow, I have no doubt that it will be bright.

How do Formula E and ABB work together?

What do ABB and Formula E say about the partnership?

After a successful Season 11, ABB and Formula E have announced that they will continue their partnership in the upcoming season. This gives ABB another opportunity to promote its new brand positioning via the ABB FIA Formula E World Championship, along with technologies that help industries take a cleaner route.Over a period of eight seasons, the partnership with Formula E has provided ABB a platform to showcase how technology can help industries outrun challenges, engage with customers around the world, and implement its own solutions into the series to improve reliability and efficiency. The partnership extension will provide a year-round opportunity for brand-building and activation, communicating ABB and its technology solutions to new global audiences, including Formula E’s international fanbase.ABB and Formula E will also join hands to engage a new generation of fans, collaborating with unexpected influencers and content creators to tell compelling stories that make advanced electrification and automation technologies tangible and exciting.The end of the mid-race car swap, a 150kW increase in power, top speeds that are 43 percent higher, and energy recovery increasing from 15 to 50 percent indicate how far Formula E technology has come to outperform on track.ABB has also built on its technical involvement in the series, supplying the race chargers from Season 9, and introducing its ABB Ability OPTIMAX® energy management software (Season 9) and Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) technology (Season 5) to the sport.ABB Head of Brand Paco Liebrand said, “We are pleased to be continuing our partnership with Formula E which, like ABB, is striving for a leaner and cleaner future. The synergy between the two organizations, combined with the global appeal of the Championship, makes it a great platform to promote our brand positioning.”He further said, “Formula E is increasingly working with content creators, influencers, and celebrities, with initiatives such as the Evo Sessions making an impact through digital channels beyond the racing itself, which is also an essential part of ABB’s new brand strategy. Going forward, we will be enhancing the way we harness the benefits of this collaboration, ensuring the focus is on delivering content and activations that reinforce our new messaging, build familiarity, and tell the ‘Engineered to Outrun’ story. ”Formula E Chief Revenue Officer Tiziana Di Gioia said, “Our renewed partnership with ABB is a testament to the commercial power and benefit of Formula E as a global platform that drives both brand and business growth. ABB, like our wider partnership portfolio, has and continues to see enormous value in collaborating with the fastest-growing motorsport on the planet, with viewership, commercial integration, and brand storytelling continuing to accelerate. Over eight seasons, ABB has moved from brand visibility to brand activation—integrating deeply into the fan experience, the sport’s ecosystem, and our innovation narrative.Also Read: Antonio Felix Da Costa shares happy memories as Porsche wins Formula E Teams and Manufacturers’ World Championships “This next chapter elevates the partnership even further. With ABB’s new positioning, we are co-creating opportunities across content, digital storytelling, and market engagement, transforming a title partnership into a year-round, value-generating relationship. It’s a model of how modern sponsorships should evolve, rooted in purpose and cultural alignment but measured by impact,” she added.Formula E Season 12 will begin with testing in Valencia in October.","ABB and Formula E have announced that they will continue their partnership in the upcoming season.

In one of the latest Daily Mail stories, Boris Becker recalls utilising his ability to read opponents during his tennis career, noting how he could identify weaknesses in players like Ivan Lendl and Stefan Edberg.This skill proved valuable during his time at Huntercombe prison near Henley-on-Thames in Oxfordshire, where he served time for Insolvency Act violations.In September 2022, after serving five months of his two-and-a-half-year sentence, Becker joined a poker game with Romanian inmates that would lead to a dangerous situation.As a foreign national, Becker was offered early release through deportation after serving half his sentence, allowing him to potentially spend Christmas with his partner Lilian.The poker games, played with matchsticks representing money, resulted in Becker accumulating a supposed debt of £500 to the Romanian inmates.For Becker, who had been a millionaire since age 17 and regularly earned millions annually, £500 would have been insignificant outside prison. However, inside it represented about eight months of weekly allowance.Two Romanian inmates visited Becker's cell demanding payment, followed by a warning from Bogdan, another Romanian inmate known for killing two men.""Boris, this guy's a little crazy. And you got to find a way to pay soon, because otherwise you're going to see how crazy he can be,"" Bogdan warned Becker.Becker arranged for a bank transfer to settle the debt without informing Lilian of the situation.A new inmate named Zac arrived at the prison, wearing a rubber cap and rumored to have mental health issues.One day, Becker confronted Zac for being in his friend Ike's cell without permission, leading to a threatening confrontation.""I'm going to f- you up. I'm going to break your head. I'm going to slit your throat. I'm going to kill you,"" Zac shouted at Becker.Fellow inmates, including Shuggy and others, intervened to protect Becker during the confrontation.Ike, a drug dealer who had become Becker's friend, later explained that Zac had spent 17 years in Belmarsh prison for murder and was mentally unstable.Three days after the incident, Zac apologized to Becker in the laundry room, kneeling and kissing his hand.""I disrespected you,"" Zac said, acknowledging both Becker and Ike's influence in the prison.Becker later played chess with Zac, deliberately losing to avoid further confrontation.Andy Small, the prison warden who taught Stoicism, had warned Becker about the exhausting nature of navigating prison relationships.Becker received numerous letters of support, including a message from Liverpool manager Jürgen Klopp, though Klopp's attempts to visit were denied by prison authorities.Lilian was eventually permitted three monthly visits, with wardens allowing limited physical contact during these meetings.Shuggy became Becker's barber, cutting both his hair and beard, requiring significant trust given the use of sharp implements.On Becker's 55th birthday, he received unexpected kindness from fellow inmates, including three separate birthday cakes from Ike, Shuggy, and Alex, an Albanian inmate.The inmates also presented Becker with a handmade birthday card, marking a stark contrast to his previous milestone birthdays.Becker's release was arranged for December 14, with plans to depart via private jet to Germany.He distributed his belongings to fellow inmates the day before his release, sharing knowing glances with Ike and Shuggy.At 6 AM on release day, Becker was escorted to Biggin Hill airport, where he reunited with Lilian.They successfully avoided media attention by landing in Stuttgart instead of Munich or Frankfurt.After his release, Becker struggled to adjust to normal life, continuing to sleep on the edge of beds as if still in his prison cot.Becker and Lilian eventually settled in Milan, Italy, starting fresh with minimal possessions.The experience helped Becker recognize the need for significant life changes, leading to his marriage to Lilian on the Italian Riviera.The article concludes with an account of Pat Cash visiting Huntercombe Prison to discuss Stoicism, leading to a reconciliation between the former tennis rivals.","Boris Becker served five months of his two-and-a-half-year sentence.

CHENNAI: Dhakshineswar Suresh has swiftly captured the spotlight in Indian tennis circles. In a twist few saw coming, the 25-year-old was drafted into India’s Davis Cup main squad from the reserves for the tie against Switzerland, a bold move by captain Rohit Rajpal that paid off.Any doubts were put to rest when world No. 626 Suresh, on his debut, stunned Jerome Kym – ranked 471 places above him –with a commanding performance. Kym entered the competition on the back of a third-round appearance at the US Open. The big-serving Suresh laid the foundation for India’s progress to the Davis Cup Qualifiers.Hailing from Madurai, the 6feet-5-inch tall Suresh was mentored by Somdev Devvarman at the Aspire academy in Chennai. During the Covid-19 pandemic, Suresh moved to the USA to pursue his dreams. The journey was not without its challenges; in 2020, he suffered a severe back injury and was barely able to walk. With the pandemic raging and the injury sidelining him, he lost precious years.However, Suresh never gave up. He continued to overcome challenges and has now become the toast of the nation. Several Indian players, including Somdev Devvarman and Mahesh Bhupathi, used the collegiate route to enhance their careers and Suresh has taken a similar route.An undergraduate student of the Wake Forest University in Winston Salem, Suresh drew attention in recent months, defeating two top-150 players en route to the Lexington Challenger quarterfinals. He later pulled off a major upset by defeating the then world No. 126 Alejandro Tabilo to reach the main draw of the ATP 250 Winston Salem Open.Despite his low ranking, Suresh was able to enter Challenger events by being among the top collegiate players, who were granted direct entry through the ATP Next Gen Accelerator programme. Interestingly, it was Somdev who guided Suresh on his move to the USA, and Somdev’s coach during his time at the University of Virginia, Tony Bresky, is now Suresh’s head coach.The two (Suresh and Somdev) first met during a pre-season camp in 2016 in Chennai, where the latter was impressed by Suresh’s talent. Somdev went on to mentor Suresh for several years and, most recently, had a short training stint with him in May.“DK (Suresh) is a part of an incredibly good system and environment. He has been playing in high-pressure matches for the past few years and that is why he looked as comfortable as he did out there (Davis Cup). It has been a long time coming because we have known his talent for a long time. There were tough times and he had different challenges. Credit to him for the work he has put in. He is just getting started and I will say with 100 per cent confidence that the best is yet to come and there is no question about it,” Somdev told TOI.While Suresh is known for his big service games, he put on an all-round show against Kym. He capped off the first set with a deft lob over Kym on set point. And he used his backhand to good effect, an area that needed improvement last year. “I have always been a believer in improving strengths. I think all the great players back themselves in what they do best. Take a look at his strengths – hitting the ball big, serving huge, and being intimidating to play against. These are the things that he should focus on. If you go out there and hold serve six times against anyone, you have got a chance.”","Dhakshineshwar Suresh was drafted into India’s Davis Cup main squad from the reserves for the tie against Switzerland.

India secured a historic spot in the Davis Cup Qualifiers after Sumit Nagal defeated young Henry Bernet in the first reverse singles, leading to a 3-1 victory over Switzerland in the World Group I tie on Saturday.The day began with N Sriram Balaji and Rithvik Bollipalli suffering a close defeat in the doubles rubber against Jakub Paul and Dominic Stricker, with scores of 7-6 (3) 4-6 5-7 in a match lasting two hours and 26 minutes.The Swiss team made a strategic change by fielding junior Australian Open champion Bernet instead of Jerome Kym for the crucial fourth rubber against Nagal, which the Indian won convincingly with scores of 6-1 6-3.India entered the day with a 2-0 lead following impressive singles victories by Nagal and newcomer Dhakshineshwar Suresh on Friday.This victory marks India's first triumph over a European team in an away tie since their win against France in the 1993 quarterfinals, led by Leander Paes and Ramesh Krishnan.India's previous European success came against Denmark in a home tie played on grass courts in Delhi in 2022.The first round of Davis Cup Qualifiers is scheduled for January 2026.Bernet's aggressive playing style resulted in numerous unforced errors, which worked in favor of the Indian player.""It means a lot. It's been a while that we won in Europe. We worked very hard to be here. We pushed each other, I am very happy with the win,"" said Nagal.""Doubles was tough, the level of tennis was very high from both teams. I was sweating more on the sidelines than playing this match. The young ones are always tricky, you don't know what's coming your way.""This was Nagal's return to Davis Cup competition since his last appearance against Morocco in September 2023, and his presence proved influential.The victory represents captain Rohit Rajpal's first significant achievement since taking over from Mahesh Bhupathi in 2019, particularly notable for being won on foreign soil.The 18-year-old Bernet started slowly, losing his serve in the opening game, but later showed promise with his single-handed backhand producing impressive corner winners.Nagal gained a crucial break point when Bernet failed to execute a half volley at 30-all while approaching the net, giving the Indian player a 4-1 advantage.The first set concluded with Bernet committing a double fault on set point, which came after a forehand error.Nagal maintained his momentum in the second set, securing an early break and maintaining the advantage until victory was sealed with Bernet's return going long.In the earlier doubles match, both Balaji and Stricker demonstrated excellent serving skills initially, holding their serves without dropping points.The Indians challenged Paul's serve but the Swiss player managed to hold after reaching deuce.The Indian pair earned three break points on Stricker's serve in the sixth game, converting the third opportunity when Stricker hit the net following an extended baseline rally with Balaji.The Swiss team recovered by breaking back when serving for the first set, capitalizing on Balaji's forehand return error at 30-all.The tiebreaker remained close at 3-3 before Paul's consecutive errors gave India the advantage.The second set remained competitive with both teams level at 4-4 after navigating through challenging moments.Despite having opportunities, including a crucial break point chance at 30-all in the ninth game, Balaji couldn't capitalize on them.The teams engaged in an intense six-deuce game, which Paul eventually won when Balaji's return went long.Bollipalli lost his serve in the following game, leveling the match at one set each.An early break put India in a favorable position, but Bollipalli faced pressure and needed three aces on deuce points to hold serve.Stricker earned a break back opportunity with a service return winner on Balaji's serve, which was converted following a double fault.The match concluded when Bollipalli, serving to stay in contention, started with a double fault and backhand error, followed by Paul's forehand winner setting up three match points, with victory secured on Bollipalli's netted return.",India beat Switzerland 3-1 in Davis Cup World Group I tie on Saturday.

LUCKNOW: Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) skipper Rishabh Pant and Mumbai Indians (MI) star Rohit Sharma will be under the scanner due to poor form when these two teams face off at the Ekana Stadium here on Friday.The lean patch of the two stalwarts has put more pressure on their respective teams, both of which have blown hot and cold and not really built any sort of winning momentum so far.LSG lost their first home game to Punjab Kings by eight wickets, being outplayed in all departments, while five-time champions Mumbai Indians have not really clicked so far this season, with just two points from three games.MI and LSG are sixth and seventh respectively on the points table, though Friday’s tie puts more pressure on Lucknow since it is another ‘home’ game, even though any sort of help from the surface hasn’t been forthcoming yet, leading to controversy.MI, meanwhile, beat Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) in their own backyard and will be relatively upbeat. It’s Rohit’s lack of runs at the top of the order, though, that may have them in a quandary.The former MI skipper seems reluctant to give himself any sort of time to gauge the surface or settle in, which has invariably led to the fall of an early wicket. Meanwhile, Pant, the costliest player in IPL history, has just 17 runs from three matches.Pant will be concerned about the runs not flowing from his blade ahead of a busy season. He has scores of 0, 15 and 2 in the three games so far and the ‘honeymoon period’ with a new franchise may soon run out.The good news for the LSG skipper is that the team's depleted pace attack now wears a much-improved look with Avesh Khan joining the team against SRH and Akash Deep slated to play Friday’s game.The prospect of some explosive batting from Nicholas Pooran (LSG) and Suryakumar Yadav (MI), though, will please the fans.","LSG lost their first home game to Punjab Kings by eight wickets.

IPL 2025: When Mohammed Siraj silenced the Chinnaswamy,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/ipl/top-stories/ipl-2025-when-mohammed-siraj-silenced-the-chinnaswamy/articleshow/119963837.cms,"Mohammed Siraj (Photo Source: X)

BENGALURU: It was a glorious return to the M Chinnaswamy Stadium for Mohammed Siraj on Wednesday night. The venue had been his IPL ‘home’ for the past seven seasons with Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB), until the franchise unceremoniously let go of the star pacer at the mega auction last year. Added to that snub was the hurt of being kept out of Team India’s white-ball scheme of things — he was ignored for the Champions Trophy recently — and no wonder Siraj was itching to unleash his trademark ‘Siu’ celebration here at the venue in Gujarat Titans colours.In the past, the celebration — inspired by his favourite footballer Cristiano Ronaldo — would often drown in the stadium’s din. On Wednesday, after his dismissal of Phil Salt, his chant reverberated around the Chinnaswamy, stunning the crowd into silence as the 31-year-old ripped through the RCB top-order.It was the perfect riposte to not only his old franchise but those who have doubted his credentials in the shorter formats. Siraj’s underwhelming performance (an economy rate of 8.81) at this venue was said to be one of the reasons he had to seek a new home with Gujarat Titans.Wednesday’s 3/19 showed he had reinvented himself, and the effort even earned praise from RCB’s head coach Andy Flower.“He bowled an outstanding spell with the new ball. His lines were really tight, his lengths were good and he threatened the stumps a lot. So, good on him,” Flower said.Flower’s assessment reflects Siraj’s growth as a white-ball bowler. He hasn’t donned the Indian colours in limited-overs formats for more than seven months now but that hasn’t stopped him from knocking on the door.Having started this IPL season on the wrong foot (0/54) against Punjab Kings, Siraj made amends when his team took on Mumbai Indians (2/34) before breathing fire against his former team -- RCB.At the Chinnaswamy, which has a benign batting pitch that is unforgiving of even marginal errors, Siraj more than held his own. Barring a boundary by Virat Kohli and a Phil Salt six , both coming in the Powerplay, there weren’t any loose deliveries from the Hyderabadi. The only blip was a wide he bowled in the 19th over.The fitter and fierier Siraj, dwelling on his second coming, said, “I had been playing consistently, but during the break I corrected my mistakes and worked on my fitness. Once I was picked up by Gujarat Titans, I spoke to Ashish bhai (Nehra, former India bowler and GT coach). He told me to go enjoy my bowling and Ishu bhai (Ishant Sharma) told me what line and length to bowl. My mindset is to have belief, and then the pitch does not matter.”",Mohammed Siraj returned to the M Chinnaswamy Stadium for the first time.

CHENNAI: R Sai Kishore has been one of the best finger spinners in the Indian domestic circuit for a few years now. But the Tamil Nadu left-arm orthodox bowler had to bide his time to become a regular playing member in the Indian Premier League IPL ).In his first IPL stint at Chennai Super Kings, Sai Kishore warmed the bench for two successive seasons as he was expectedly behind Ravindra Jadeja, a master of his craft, in the pecking order.While the tweaker broke into the Gujarat Titans (GT) XI in the business end of their title-winning campaign in 2022, he had to be content with a bit-part role in the previous three-year cycle because of the presence of top-quality spinners in Rashid Khan and Noor Ahmad. But this year, he has been a regular feature.On Wednesday at the M Chinnaswamy Stadium against Royal Challengers Bengaluru, it was his spell of 2 for 22 that went a long way in Titans winning the game. The lanky left-armer was bought back by Titans for Rs 2 crore using the ‘Right To Match’ card at the mega auction.With Noor making the move to CSK, Sai Kishore, who has a phenomenal economy of 5.98 in 73 T20 matches, has been elevated to a frontline spinner in the ‘playing XII’ (including the Impact Player). The 28-year-old is leading the wickets chart for GT with six scalps in three matches.“I’m actually looking forward to this season (playing more matches). All this while, I’ve watched a lot of games and learnt a lot. I’ve been very honest with myself and have worked really hard. Let us hope that this season is a wonderful one,” said Sai Kishore after GT’s win over Mumbai Indians in Ahmedabad.The left-arm slow bowler has underlined his credentials with match-influencing spells in less-than-favourable conditions for the spinners. When PBKS put on a boundary-hitting exhibition in Ahmedabad, Sai Kishore produced a miserly effort of 3 for 30.On Wednesday, he foxed the RCB batters with variations, which included angles, speeds and type of deliveries. The one that caught everyone’s attention was the ‘carrom ball’ that he unleashed against Krunal Pandya, with the southpaw having no clue how to deal with it and handing a simple return catch.“To be relevant in T20 cricket, you have to keep evolving. I have been practising that ball for the last three years, but I had not bowled it anywhere. I was confident enough to bowl it in this IPL; I just went with my instinct. It is like a carrom ball, I get more dip on it. You can call it anything (laughs),” said Sai Kishore.Sai Sudharsan, the Tamil Nadu red-ball skipper’s statemate and a teammate at GT, hailed him for being a street-smart operator.“Off the field, I see the amount of effort he puts in and the preparation he does in terms of having tactical advantages over the batters. That is putting him ahead of the other bowlers. He understands the game and situation, he uses his speeds and angles accordingly. It is one of the strengths he has. That is why he is bowling the way he has been,” Sai Sudharsan said.“In this game (against RCB), Sai Kishore’s spell was the most important one because it was difficult facing the fast bowlers on this pitch. As batters, we try to maximise against the spinners (on such pitches). He was smart enough. He used the right speeds and angles,” he added.",Sai Kishore has been one of the best finger spinners in Indian domestic circuit.

I think this is a very competitive score. If we bowl and field well, we should win this.""He credited his teammates for setting up the platform: ""I was watching the match from the screen, it wasn’t easy to play shots. The ball was holding a bit, but Ajinkya (Rahane) and Angkrish (Raghuvanshi) were really good to set up the innings for us.""Iyer also highlighted the impact of domestic cricket on players' development: ""It helps a lot that the BCCI has made it mandatory for everyone to play domestic cricket. It gives us a good chance of playing against quality bowlers, and you've seen so many bowlers coming around. It’s very challenging playing against them.""KKR’s total of 200/6 was built on Iyer’s explosive knock, along with contributions from Ajinkya Rahane (38), Angkrish Raghuvanshi (50), and Rinku Singh (32).",Venkatesh Iyer scores third consecutive half-century against Sunrisers Hyderabad.

New Zealand's 84-run win over Pakistan in the second ODI in Hamilton on Tuesday gave the hosts an unassailable 2-0 lead in the three-match series, thanks to wicketkeeper-batter Mitchell Hay 's unbeaten 99 and a five-wicket haul by pacer Ben Sears .Hay was unlucky to miss a century by just a solitary run, but his 78-ball blitz helped New Zealand put up a challenging 292 for 8 on the board, after which Sears led the bowling charge with a spell of 5 for 59 that saw Pakistan getting bowled out for 208 in 41.2 overs.New Zealand had won the first ODI by 73 runs.Hay's knock rescued the Kiwis from a mid-innings bother, as the wicketkeeper-batter struck 7 fours and as many sixes, having arrived at the crease when New Zealand were at a precarious 132 for 5 in the 27th over.Pakistan's response faltered early when Will O'Rourke had Abdullah Shafique (1) caught at first slip in the third over, followed by Babar Azam (1) being caught at second slip off Jacob Duffy in the subsequent over.In his next over, Duffy claimed Imam-ul-Haq's (3) wicket. Pakistan were 9 for 3 in the sixth over and Sears made it worse for the visitors, dismissing both Salman Agha (9) and Mohammad Rizwan (5) in his first over to make it 32 for 5 in 12 overs.Tayyab Tahir (13) and Faheem Ashraf collaborated for a 33-run sixth-wicket partnership before Tahir was sent back by Nathan Smith. After Haris Rauf retired hurt on 3, his concussion substitute Naseem Shah joined Ashraf to build a 60-run stand.Both scored their maiden half-centuries, with Ashraf accumulating 73 from 80 balls while Naseem contributed 51 off 44 deliveries.Earlier, under overcast conditions and with a green-tinged pitch favouring bowling, Pakistan captain Rizwan elected to field after winning the toss. But Nick Kelly and Rhys Mariu started confidently despite their lack of experience.Their partnership reached 54 runs before Kelly, playing just his second international match, edged Rauf to be caught behind for 31, including 4 fours and 2 sixes.Making his first appearance, Mariu departed for 18 runs from 25 deliveries, offering a simple catch to Azam at mid-off from Wasim's first over.The bowling pair of Wasim and Rauf restricted the run flow effectively, with Henry Nicholls and Daryl Mitchell requiring until the 16th over to help New Zealand reach 100.When spin was introduced, Mitchell's innings concluded at 18 runs as Rizwan completed a stumping off Sufiyan Muqeem's delivery. Nicholls followed in the subsequent over, departing for 22.Bracewell and Abbas managed a modest 30-run partnership spanning 10 overs before Wasim dismissed Bracewell, who was caught behind after scoring 17.Abbas, who was born in Pakistan, formed a steady partnership of 77 runs with Hay, until he departed after scoring 41.Among the Pakistan bowlers, Muqeem delivered the best performance with figures of 2 for 33, while Wasim finished with 2 for 78.",New Zealand beat Pakistan by 84 runs to take 2-0 lead in three-match series.

NEW DELHI: The Rs 27 crore tag seems to be continuously haunting star wicketkeeper Rishabh Pant . With two defeats in three matches, Lucknow Super Giants are already under fire, and Pant is bearing the brunt. The LSG captain's repeated failures in IPL 2025—both with the bat and in leadership—have become a hot topic.LSG have two points from three games and are sixth in the points table. Pant has scored 0 against Delhi Capitals, 15 against Sunrisers Hyderabad, and 2 against Punjab Kings , and his poor form has put him under immense pressure.Former India spinner Harbhajan Singh has suggested that LSG find a solution as soon as possible to address their Pant conundrum. Harbhajan termed Pant a ""huge shock"" for the LSG side.""Rishabh Pant wasn't able to do much. His bat has been quiet. They will have to do something about him getting out early.

After losing the toss, they didn't score many runs and disappointed themselves. Nicholas Pooran played brilliantly, but he was trapped by Yuzvendra Chahal. So when Pooran got out, LSG's back was pretty much broken.

Royal Challengers Bengaluru ( RCB ) will open their home account at the M Chinnaswamy Stadium tonight (April 2) against Gujarat Titans ( GT ).Though the Women’s Premier League (WPL) wrapped up three weeks ago, the ongoing heat and dryness have left the pitches looking browner than usual.RCB, coming off two consecutive wins to start the season, won’t mind this. Such a start has only occurred for the team twice before, in 2014 and 2021.In previous seasons, this notion of no home advantage could have affected RCB. However, this time may be different. Last year, they made a remarkable run to the playoffs, winning three out of their last six games at home consecutively.Also See: RCB vs GT, IPL Live Score 2025 Against the raucous crowd support for RCB, GT will need to explore various combinations. Should Jos Buttler open alongside Shubman Gill to enhance their powerplay?With David Miller not retained and Rahul Tewatia not in his prime hitting form, they risk over-relying on their top order. However, their bowling attack has the potential to deliver. Prasidh Krishna returns home, having played for Karnataka, and Mohammed Siraj returns to a venue that was his IPL home for seven years.Teams haven't dealt with much dew in the last two days. Regarding the pitch, Mo Bobat, RCB's director, anticipates a “typical Bengaluru pitch” that should produce plenty of runs.Notably, the 200-run mark wasn't surpassed in any of the seven knockout matches of the Syed Mushtaq Ali T20s held here in December. The same trend was observed in the seven WPL games, where spinners managed to take advantage of the surface.Royal Challengers Bengaluru probable XI: Virat Kohli, Phil Salt, Devdutt Padikkal, Rajat Patidar (c), Liam Livingstone, Jitesh Sharma (wk), Tim David, Krunal Pandya, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Josh Hazlewood, Yash Dayal.Impact Player: Suyash SharmaGujarat Titans probably XI: Shubman Gill (c), Jos Buttler (wk), Sai Sudharsan, Shahrukh Khan, Sherfane Rutherford, Rahul Tewatia, Rashid Khan, Kagiso Rabada, R Sai Kishore, Mohammad Siraj, Prasidh Krishna.Impact Player: Ishant SharmaRoyal Challengers Bengaluru squad: Philip Salt, Virat Kohli, Devdutt Padikkal, Rajat Patidar(c), Liam Livingstone, Jitesh Sharma(w), Tim David, Krunal Pandya, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Josh Hazlewood, Yash Dayal, Suyash Sharma, Rasikh Dar Salam, Manoj Bhandage, Jacob Bethell, Swapnil Singh, Abhinandan Singh, Romario Shepherd, Lungi Ngidi, Nuwan Thushara, Mohit Rathee, Swastik Chikara.Gujarat Titans squad: Sai Sudharsan, Shubman Gill(c), Jos Buttler(w), Shahrukh Khan, Sherfane Rutherford, Rahul Tewatia, Rashid Khan, Kagiso Rabada, Ravisrinivasan Sai Kishore, Mohammed Siraj, Prasidh Krishna, Ishant Sharma, Washington Sundar, Glenn Phillips, Anuj Rawat, Mahipal Lomror, Arshad Khan, Jayant Yadav, Nishant Sindhu, Kulwant Khejroliya, Gerald Coetzee, Manav Suthar, Kumar Kushagra, Gurnoor Brar, Karim Janat.Matches played: 5Royal Challengers Bengaluru won: 3Gujarat Titans won: 2Last match: Royal Challengers Bengaluru won by 9 wickets (2024)RCB have three wins out of five against GT but their record at home isn't the best.

Mumbai: In a massive development, India's Test opener Yashasvi Jaiswal has decided to quit Mumbai and move to Goa. The 23-year-old will captain Goa in the 2025-26 season.On Wednesday, Jaiswal wrote an email to the Mumbai Cricket Association (MCA) seeking a No Objection Certificate (NOC) to change his cricket state team from Mumbai to Goa from the next season onwards. The MCA subsequently granted him the NOC.“He wrote an e-mail to us, seeking an NOC from the MCA to represent Goa next season. We’ve accepted his request,” Abhay Hadap MCA secretary told TOI.In his email to the MCA seeking transfer to Goa from Mumbai, Jaiswal communicated, ""I have had the privilege of representing Mumbai in domestic cricket and have immensely benefited from the opportunities provided by the association. However, after careful consideration of my career aspirations and personal circumstances, I have decided to seek a transfer to Goa to continue my domestic cricket journey. I assure you that this decision is made in good faith and with due respect to the association that has supported my development. I am willing to comply with all necessary formalities as per the BCCI’s player transfer regulations and will ensure a smooth transition.""""Thank you for your support and guidance throughout my time with Mumbai. I sincerely appreciate all the opportunities given to me and hope to maintain a positive relationship with the association in the future.""Also See: IPL Live Score, RCB vs GT Meanwhile, BCCI joint secretary Rohan Desai, who was the secretary of the Goa Cricket Association till recently, told TOI, “It’s a great development for Goan cricket. Goa’s cricketers, especially the youngsters, will get to learn a lot from Jaiswal , who is a part of India’s Test team. It’s a blessing in disguise that a player of his stature will be a part of Goa’s dressing room. It’s a good decision by the GCA management, especially Shambha Desai, the secretary of the GCA to include Yashasvi in the squad. I’m looking forward to an exciting season for Goa.”Jaiswal made his first-class debut for Mumbai at the Wankhede Stadium in January 2019 against Chhattisgarh in a Ranji Trophy match, and has scored a majority of his 3712 first-class runs, including 12 hundreds and 12 fifties, in 36 matches for Mumbai. It was his sizzling performances for Mumbai that brought the dashing left-hander into the national reckoning.In October 2019, Jaiswal became the youngest man to hit a one-day double century, when, at the age of just 17, he smashed 203 off 154 balls against Jharkhand in the Vijay Hazare Trophy. In June 2022, the left-hander stroked twin hundreds (100 & 181) against Uttar Pradesh in the Ranji Trophy, and didn’t look back.In recent years, Mumbai players like Arjun Tendulkar, Siddhesh Lad, Kshemal Waingankar and Eknath Kerkar have played for Goa.After the BCCI’s directive to the players to turn out for their state teams in domestic cricket, Jaiswal played in a Ranji Trophy match for Mumbai in the Ranji Trophy in the 2024-25 season, scoring 4 & 26 in the five-wicket defeat to Jammu & Kashmir at the MCA ground in BKC in Mumbai in Jan this year. Left out of India’s Champions Trophy squad but included in the list of non-travelling substitutes, the left-hander was drafted into the Mumbai Ranji squad ahead of their semifinal clash with Vidarbha in Nagpur on February 17. However, he had to pull out of the match just a day before the game due to pain in his ankle.Even though he belongs to the Bhadohi village in Uttar Pradesh, Jaiswal has a deep emotional connection with Mumbai, where he has played all his cricket till now in life. As a kid, he used to sleep in the Muslim United SC tent at the Azad Maidan and sometimes sell panipuris in the evening to make a living, before his childhood coach/mentor Jwala Singh took him to his home in Santa Cruz. In 2015, former India skipper Dilip Vengsarkar took Jaiswal to the UK for an exposure tour with his academy team. Jaiswal first attracted attention by making huge scores for the Rizvi Springfield School in the Harris Shield (inter-school competition for Under-16), and then did well for the Mumbai Under-16, Under-19 and Under-23 teams, before being picked for the Mumbai senior team.Jaiswal has currently been struggling for form while playing for the Rajasthan Royals in IPL-2025, where he has managed to score only 34 runs in three matches@11.33, with a strike rate of 106.25. The youngster was one of the standout performers for India in the 2024-25 Border-Gavaskar Trophy, where he scored 391 runs in five Tests@43.44, with one century and two half-centuries.",India's Test opener Yashasvi Jaiswal has decided to quit Mumbai and move to Goa. The 23-year-old will captain Goa in the 2025-26 season.

Ricky Ponting praises Punjab Kings' Rolls Royce - Shreyas Iyer,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/ipl/top-stories/ricky-ponting-praises-punjab-kings-rolls-royce-shreyas-iyer/articleshow/119902221.cms,"Shreyas Iyer (BCCI Photo)

After a perfect start of 2/2 wins, led from the front by their new captain Shreyas Iyer , there's no doubt now that the Punjab Kings played a masterstroke by acquiring the service of Shreyas at the IPL mega auction last November. The INR 26.75 crore they spent on the batter could well prove to be worth every penny. However, there's still a long way to go, but the team's new coach Ricky Ponting has full faith in Shreyas, who the Australian calls ' Rolls Royce '.Punjab defeated Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) by eight wickets on Monday to build on their 11-run opening win of the season against Gujarat Titans. In both the victories, Shreyas played a key role, scoring 97 not out off 42 balls against Lucknow and a 30-ball 52 not out against Gujarat.After the win on Monday, Ponting praised Shreyas for his consistency, comparing his control and finesse on the crease to the luxury car 'Rolls Royce'.""Skipper (Iyer) did it easy again. Rolls-Royce just stayed in third gear for most of the day. Didn't have to go any harder than that. Just steers the ship home. You haven't got an average yet,"" Ponting said about the Punjab skipper, who is yet to be dismissed.The Australian legend emphasised the importance of sustained dedication from his team members throughout the demanding season that lasts over two months. The final is scheduled for May 25.""Let's not take anything for granted with anything we're doing. Our attitudes have been spot on. We're just starting to scratch the surface. So let's keep working hard together as a family, as one. And we're going to get better every day,"" he added.The Punjab Kings bowlers demonstrated exceptional control from the beginning, which proved instrumental in restricting the hosts. Ponting acknowledged that this disciplined bowling approach was a crucial factor in determining the match's outcome.""Bowling first today, Arshdeep's (Singh) first over goes for three, Lockie (Ferguson) backs it up with an over, goes for four (runs). Two overs in the powerplay 1 for 7. We get through the powerplay, 3 for 35. Four of the overs in power play only went for 13 runs. So in the fifth over, Maxi (Glenn Maxwell) comes on and then on the back of that, Marco (Jansen). So, Marco bowls the sixth over. He absolutely means it. He ended up with the big wicket of David Miller,"" Ponting recalled, praising the team's focus.""The pleasing thing for me about a lot of the things that are happening around the group, it's when guys are coming in and playing their first game or getting their first opportunity; Lockie was the same today,"" Ponting analysed.Punjab's chase was spearheaded by opener Prabhsimran Singh, who deflated the LSG bowlers with a flurry of boundaries and ended up scoring 69 off 34 balls, including 9 fours and 3 sixes. It laid the foundation for Shreyas and Nehal Wadhera (43 not out off 25 balls) to play their natural game and take the team home.""Prabhsimran, I think you have learned a lot about yourself this week as well. I think you've proved to everyone just what a class act you are,"" said Ponting, before switching to praising Wadhera's knock.""We talk about players making an impact, right? You get an opportunity in a T20 game and it's all about making an impact on the game and on the contest when you can. He (Wadhera) only packed one shirt in his bag because he didn't think he was going to be taking much part in the game. He fields the last four overs and then I tap him on the shoulder. When I saw that they'd (LSG) made their impact sub as a left-arm off spinner, I said, 'mate, you're going in'.""","Punjab defeated Lucknow Super Giants by eight wickets on Monday to build on their 11-run opening win of the season against Gujarat Titans. In both the victories, Shreyas played a key role, scoring 97 not out off 42 balls against Lucknow and a 30-ball 52 not out against Gujarat.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-119902223,imgsize-40860,width-400,resizemode-4/119902223.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Jasprit Bumrah ’s return to competitive cricket may take a little longer. It is understood that he is yet to bowl full tilt at the BCCI’s Centre of Excellence (CoE). Pacer Akash Deep’s comeback, too, has been pushed back by at least a week.TOI has learnt that Bumrah is clinically fit, but his workload is being increased gradually since he is at risk of suffering a stress fracture of the back. Even Akash Deep is nursing a back injury. Both pacers have not played any competitive cricket since the tour of Australia. While Bumrah suffered a lower back injury during the middle of the Syndey Test in the first week of January, Akash Deep couldn’t make it to the XI after developing some “discomfort”.The BCCI medical team has decided to tread very cautiously with Bumrah, given India are slated to play five Tests in England immediately after the IPL . As it is, the national selectors and the team management are not banking on Bumrah to play all five Tests.Also See: GT vs RCB Live Score, IPL 2025 “Bumrah’s injury is a bit more serious. The medical team wants to ensure he doesn’t suffer a stress fracture. Bumrah himself is being careful. He is bowling at the CoE but it could take longer to get back in full swing. No definite timeline has been set yet, but one hopes he gets back by mid-April. Akash Deep too hopes to get back by April 10,” a BCCI source said.Bumrah was initially expected to join Mumbai Indians by April 1.Meanwhile, Lucknow Super Giants pacer Mayank Yadav is also on the same timeline as Akash Deep and Bumrah. According to the refreshed standard operating procedure, the bowling coach at the CoE will have to give the final clearance. While the medical team decides if the player if fit enough to endure the rigours of high-performance sport, the bowling coach must decide if he is ready to go once he leaves the CoE.","Jasprit Bumrah is yet to bowl full tilt at the BCCI’s Centre of Excellence.

NEW DELHI: Kolkata Knight Riders batter Rinku Singh found himself at the center of a lighthearted moment after Kolkata Knight Riders’ (KKR) clash against Mumbai Indians (MI) on Monday.A short video posted on MI’s official social media platforms captured Rinku hilariously getting teased by MI’s batter Tilak Varma for asking Rohit Sharma for a bat.In the video, Rinku is seen requesting a bat from Rohit Sharma, prompting Tilak to joke, “Khud ke naam ka itna accha bat hai, phir bhi bat mangta hai dekho” (He has such a good bat in his name, yet he’s asking for one!).This sparked laughter, and MI skipper Hardik Pandya also joined in the friendly banter.Watch:Towards the end of the clip, young KKR player Angkrish Raghuvanshi is seen holding a bat, looking visibly delighted, adding to the fun atmosphere.This isn’t the first time Rinku has been spotted asking for bats from top players. Last season, he received a bat from none other than Virat Kohli However, when Rinku recently approached Kohli again for another bat, the former RCB skipper seemed less amused, especially after Rinku admitted that he had broken the previous one while facing a spinner.Despite this, Rinku later confirmed in a viral video that he had received a new bat from Virat, delighting his fans.More recently, the KKR star was also seen requesting a bat from India’s T20I captain Suryakumar Yadav , continuing his tradition of collecting bats from some of the best in the game.MI delivered a dominant performance against KKR at the Wankhede Stadium.Led by debutant Ashwani Kumar’s sensational 4-wicket haul, MI bowled KKR out for a mere 116 runs in 16.2 overs and chased down the target in 12.5 overs, winning the game by eight wickets.ALSO READ: Ricky Ponting praises Punjab Kings' Rolls Royce - Shreyas Iyer",Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) batter Rinku Singh asked Rohit Sharma for a bat.

‘Pressure never bothers me; I play my natural game’

Deandra Dottin , one of the superstars in women’s cricket, was in Vadodara recently to play for Gujarat Giants in a women’s cricket league. The West Indian all-rounder, who was the first woman cricketer to score a century in T20 internationals, tells us, “I thoroughly enjoyed playing at the Baroda Cricket Association (BCA) stadium in Kotambi, where the facilities were excellent. Also, it is good to see the way Indian fans encourage women cricketers. It’s fantastic to see that women’s cricket has evolved so much since the time I started playing the game. Finally, it is getting the kind of attention it deserves and people are coming to the stadium to watch our matches. What more can a professional cricketer ask for? When fans come to watch you play and your matches are televised, you feel that you deserve to be here. There is no better feeling than that!”She adds, “During our stay in Vadodara, we visited the Laxmi Vilas Palace and had a nice conversation with Radhikaraje Gaekwad from the Baroda royal family. I quite liked the city. What I love the most about India is that no matter which city you travel to, people make you feel welcomed. Although I am a big foodie, I find Indian food a bit spicy. No chillies for me (laughs), but I manage to find non-spicy food too.”Deandra, who landed a ₹1.70 crore deal at the auction for the league, has often been compared to Chris Gayle for their similar playing styles. And while Gayle calls himself Universe Boss, Deandra calls herself World Boss. Asked about it, she laughs, “I gave myself that name and it’s pretty nice, isn’t it? Before I took up cricket professionally, I used to represent Barbados in athletics, especially javelin throw and shot put. I was doing pretty well and creating new records in athletics. That’s how that name came about (smiles). However, there came a time when schedules of athletics and cricket were clashing, and I had to choose one. It has been a wonderful journey.”Asked about coping with the pressure of expectations and comparisons with Gayle, she says, “I enjoy performing under pressure and it doesn’t really bother me. I just play my natural game and trust my ability.”",Deandra Dottin was in Vadodara recently to play for Gujarat Giants in a women's cricket league.

Bombay Sport Exchange Episode 1: Interview with Sanjog Gupta, CEO (Sports) at JioStar

NEW DELHI: Pakistan cricketer Saud Shakeel took a subtle dig at the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) during a recent interview, making a sarcastic remark about the board’s instability in appointing a permanent head coach.Shakeel humorously stated, ""If I become the PCB Chairman, the first thing I will do is bring in a permanent coach for three years.""His comment comes amid ongoing uncertainty surrounding Pakistan’s coaching staff.Over the past few years, Morne Morkel Gary Kirsten , and Jason Gillespie have all stepped down from coaching roles due to alleged power struggles within the PCB.The frequent changes have led to growing criticism of the board’s management.Meanwhile, on the field, Pakistan faced another disappointing result as New Zealand secured an 84-run victory in Hamilton, sealing the series win 2-0.The Kiwis, now aiming for a 3-0 whitewash, will play the final ODI in Mount Maunganui on Saturday.Batting first, New Zealand posted a challenging total of 292/8, with Mitchell Hay leading the charge with an unbeaten 99 off 78 balls.Rhys Mariu (18) and Nick Kelly (31) provided a quick start before Pakistan struck back with key wickets.At one point, New Zealand were struggling at 132/5, but Lahore-born Muhammad Abbas (41) and Hay put together a crucial 77-run stand to stabilise the innings. Sufiyan Muqeem (2/33) and Mohammad Wasim (2/78) were Pakistan’s best bowlers.Chasing 293, Pakistan’s top order crumbled under pressure. Abdullah Shafique (1), Babar Azam (1), and Imam-ul-Haq (0) all fell cheaply, leaving Pakistan at a disastrous 9/3 in 5.3 overs.Despite some resistance from Faheem Ashraf (73 off 80) and Naseem Shah (51 off 44), Pakistan couldn’t recover from the early collapse and were eventually bowled out.Ben Sears (5/59) and Jacob Duffy (3/35) were the standout bowlers for New Zealand.With the series already decided, Pakistan will now fight to avoid a humiliating whitewash in the final ODI.","Pakistan cricketer Saud Shakeel takes a dig at the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) during a recent interview.

Barcelona advanced to the Copa del Rey final against Real Madrid after securing a 1-0 victory over Atletico Madrid at the Metropolitano stadium on Wednesday, with Ferran Torres scoring the decisive goal for a 5-4 aggregate win in the semi-final tie. The Catalans continue their impressive unbeaten run in 2025, now stretching to 21 games.Barcelona, who have won the Copa del Rey a record 31 times, dominated the match following the entertaining 4-4 draw in the first leg.The defeat leaves Atletico Madrid with limited objectives for the remainder of the season, as they now trail Barcelona by nine points in La Liga with nine matches left.""We can't relax, we have to keep believing and working, with humility and I'm sure good things will come,"" Torres told Movistar. ""If a final is already a huge motivation, imagine playing against your most direct rival.""Real Madrid secured their place in the final after a 5-4 aggregate victory over Real Sociedad, following a 4-4 draw at the Santiago Bernabeu on Tuesday.Barcelona manager Hansi Flick reinstated Raphinha to the starting lineup, with the Brazilian winger becoming a target for Atletico's defensive tactics.Cesar Azpilicueta received a yellow card for a challenge on Raphinha, surviving a VAR review for a potential red card, while Rodrigo de Paul was also booked for a hard tackle.Seventeen-year-old Lamine Yamal impressed on the opposite wing, creating chances and providing the assist for Torres's goal with a well-weighted pass.Atletico Madrid introduced Alexander Sorloth at halftime, who had scored in the previous three meetings between the teams this season.Sorloth missed a clear opportunity early in the second half, opting to shoot instead of passing to an unmarked Antoine Griezmann.The Norwegian striker later had a goal disallowed for offside as Atletico increased their pressure on Barcelona's defense.""We played really bravely here, it was not easy, especially in the second half,"" Flick told Barca One.

Arsenal lose Gabriel

Nottingham Forest secured a crucial 1-0 victory over Manchester United at the City Ground on Tuesday, strengthening their Champions League hopes, while Arsenal maintained pressure on league leaders Liverpool with a 2-1 win against Fulham, marked by Bukayo Saka's return from injury and goal.Former Manchester United winger Anthony Elanga scored the decisive goal for Forest just five minutes into the match with a remarkable solo effort, running from his own half before beating Andre Onana with a low shot.Third-placed Forest now hold a 10-point advantage over Newcastle in sixth position, with the top five teams likely to qualify for Champions League due to English clubs' strong European performances this season.Forest, two-time European champions, haven't competed in the Champions League since 1980 when they were title holders.Elanga, who left United in 2023, has found success under Nuno Espirito Santo at Forest.""He's a special boy and he gives this team his speed. He does it by himself and we are delighted,"" said Nuno about Elanga's performance.Forest's impressive season continues despite playing 120 minutes plus penalties against Brighton in Saturday's FA Cup quarter-final and missing top scorer Chris Wood through injury.United's manager Ruben Amorim expressed frustration with his team's performance: ""This season is like that. We had a lot of shots on goal, we pushed the opponent to the last third, but in the last third we had a lack of quality. We should have won this game, not even drawn, but in the end we have lost three points.""United remain in 13th place, still unable to secure consecutive Premier League wins this season.In Arsenal's match, Mikel Merino's deflected shot gave them the lead before Saka headed in his first goal since returning from injury.""A beautiful moment to see how much our people love and respect Bukayo,"" Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta said regarding the warm reception Saka received.Arsenal's victory was overshadowed by defender Gabriel Magalhaes's injury exit, adding to their injury concerns ahead of their Champions League quarter-final against Real Madrid.Saka made an immediate impact after replacing Ethan Nwaneri, scoring his tenth goal of the season by heading in Martinelli's flick from Merino's cross.Rodrigo Muniz scored a late consolation goal for Fulham, whose European ambitions took a hit with the defeat.Arsenal's injury list continues to grow with Jurrien Timber also leaving the game, joining already sidelined players Riccardo Calafiori, Ben White, Kai Havertz, and Gabriel Jesus.The victory reduced Arsenal's gap to league leaders Liverpool to nine points.In other Premier League action, Wolves boosted their survival prospects with a 1-0 win over West Ham at Molineux, with Jorgen Strand Larsen scoring the only goal, moving them 12 points clear of the relegation zone.",Nottingham Forest beat Manchester United 1-0 at the City Ground.

The Brazilians are monumentally hurt. Vinicius Junior has called for a seismic rethinking after returning from an embarrassing trip across the border. A 1-4 loss to Argentina, their bete noire, in the World Cup qualifier rang throughout the football cathedrals of the world, with stark images of the Mineirazo blinking on the stream of consciousness and social media.That had happened on the fateful June evening, the agony in Belo Horizonte, where Brazil suffered a humiliating 7-1 defeat to Germany on their own turf in the 2014 World Cup semifinal. Two unsuccessful World Cup campaigns followed, which took a toll on Tite, Ramon Menezes (caretaker), Fernando Diniz (caretaker). Last week, the sword, as expected, fell on Dorival Junior .Amid such changes, Brazil’s tendency to implode occasionally has been the excruciating constant. It is not the first time in the recent past that Brazil conceded four. Swamped with information that’s mostly unnecessary and used to obfuscate thought and reason, the world forgot that under Menezes in a June 2023 friendly, Sadio Mane’s Senegal pumped as many past Ederson, the Man City goalkeeper. Last week, however, the unfortunate gloveman was Bento.With 18 months to go for the World Cup, Brazil’s suffering against an Argentina that was without Lionel Messi, only strengthens the notion that the Canarinhos will qualify for the World Cup 2026, but nothing beyond. Thankfully with six out of 10 ten teams making it out of the South American group in this time’s inflated 48-team competition, Brazil and its fans don’t have to spend sleepless nights.The question that keeps popping up like unwelcome adverts, though, is, what ails Pele ’s team? Well, as the football romantic Simon Kuper says, “Brazil will always be Pele’s team.” For a while, it was also Ronaldo’s team. Post-Ronaldo, the history of Brazil is a history of struggle against Europe, non-transference of knowledge, and a story of brilliant individuals failing to play as a team.Their World Cup campaigns are a repeat-show of slipping on European banana peels. In 2006, it was Zidane’s France. Four years later in South Africa, it was Wesley Sneijder who rose above the yellow shirts. In their own backyard, Belo Horizonte, Brazil scripted their darkest chapter against Germany. Kevin de Bryune’s Belgium undid Neymar-powered Brazilians in Russia. In Qatar, Luka Modric’s Croatia cut short their run even though hardly any non-Croatian remembers Mislav Orsic the provider or Bruno Petkovic, the one who equalized.It marked Brazil’s fifth elimination in the World Cup against European opposition since a 2-0 victory over Germany in the 2002 final. No wonder Vinicius is left crying after the fresh debacle on the banks of River Plate.“Everyone did badly, we played badly, and Argentina played excellent,” Vinicius said, “We must rethink everything we’ve been doing, because the pressure will come, the people want us to win.“The World Cup is a year away and I’ve already played in a World Cup and I don’t want to lose again. I think we must do a lot of different things and take the good things we’re doing in qualifying to build a squad. Everyone knows how difficult it is to play in this kit, but we must keep our heads up. We’re going to qualify for the World Cup and try to do everything for our country,” he would add.Perhaps, the screams are a little too late in coming. Lest we forget, the country’s Olympic team, the stepping stone to the Selecao, failed to qualify for Paris 2024. Those who could recall another friendly against Spain under Dorival, the lingering image was how Lamine Yamal taught the visitors lessons in dribbling, a skill that was once the domain of the men in yellow.The words of Mario Zagallo, a World Cup winner as both a player and coach, turned out to be prophetic. He warned that the sellout of homegrown talent has led to the erosion of Brazil’s football identity. He was speaking right after Mineirazo; even a decade later — till his death this January — he wasn’t proven wrong.Leaving the shores early for Europe, is almost a Brazilian way of life. One can argue with some truth that they don’t make Pele, Garrincha, a Romario or Ronaldo anymore, just as they don’t make Shakespeare anymore.Raphinha is the key to Barcelona’s current degree of hotness. Players with lesser ability have come together to win football’s highest honour with organization, coaching acumen and a slice of luck. Marquinhos, for his life, will not be able to explain how Petkovic’s shot took that deflection to send Alisson the wrong way in Qatar. Neither could Tite.Dorival Junior is the third coach that the CBF has sacked after Tite resigned following the 2022 exit. Often quick changes in coaching staff are held responsible. Mario Zagallo was appointed just three months prior to the 1970 World Cup. And the team that rediscovered the ‘beautiful game” under Tele Santana in 1982, considered to be the best team not to have won the World Cup, had been under his charge for a full two years.In Brazil, it has always been the triumph of the individual over the collective. Unreasonable it may seem, as we are constantly feeding off European models. No one can explain Branco’s goal from a free-kick against Holland in 1994. Or Oliver Kahn’s spilling of Rivaldo’s stinger with Ronaldo sniffing around.In 2002, Brazil’s humungous qualification struggle had been buried into oblivion. Among four automatic slots, Brazil hadslipped in claiming the third! Reading Brazil, we instantly go back some 75 years when the world empathized with the struggle of the underprivileged. The intermediate changes in the society are overlooked as we lament Brazil’s reversals.Samindra Kunti, author of Brazil 1970, says, “The romantic idea of football is dead and we are forever expecting Brazil to rekindle the dream.”Maybe Brazil have wasted three years of preparation time or who knows, someone like Zagallo will appear to inspire and wipe away Vinicius’s tears.Marcela Mora y Araujo, who specialises in South American football, feels that the debacle against Argentina is just a blip and not a crisis.“Brazil’s qualification road has not always been smooth if we go by the history. They always have an ace up their sleeve.”",Brazil lost 1-4 to Argentina in a World Cup qualifier in Rio de Janeiro.

‘One defeat cannot define who Brazil are’

Chennai: With the World Cup little over a year away, Brazil find themselves in a not-so-ideal situation. The five-time champions, often expected to cruise through the qualifiers, are huffing and puffing on their way to the football extravaganza.The South American heavyweights are terribly low on morale after enduring their heaviest defeat in WC qualifying history, a 1-4 drubbing at the hands of bitter rivals and defending champions Argentina recently. Making matters worse, Brazil are without a head coach following the ouster of Dorival Jr and have gone back to square one.World Cup winners Dunga and Gilberto Silva , who know a thing or two about dazzling for Brazil on the global stage, remarked that the national federation should have finalised the manager for the World Cup a long time ago. “We have a lot of good coaches in Brazil, but here is the problem. We have one year to go for the WC and we are still looking for a coach. Postponing things might be the biggest problem. You start winning the World Cup off the field,” said Dunga, who is in Chennai for the Brazil Legends-India All Stars match and Football Plus summit.The seasoned Carlo Ancelotti, currently under contract at La Liga giants Real Madrid, has been heavily linked with the Brazil top job. “Sometimes, people take decisions based on emotions. This is not the solution. Sometimes, we have to be in this kind of situation, which is very disappointing. We are going to look for a manager one year before the start of the competition. This makes the work of the players even harder (tougher). I hope that whoever they (federation) decide, we start to play well again,” said Gilberto.Brazil have been let down by the indifferent international form of potential game-changers Vinicius Jr and Raphinha, players who have been delivering at club level.On why they are struggling to replicate their club form playing for the country, Gilberto said: “There is a massive difference between club and country. In a club, you are there every day, training with your colleagues and coach. In the national team, you may have the opportunity to spend time with your colleagues and manager about six times a year. It is not enough. In the short time, the players have to do as much as they can to maintain a high level.”The 2002 WC-winning member, who made the defensive midfielder’s position his own, added: “When you are in the national team of any country, there is massive pressure. When you are in Brazil, people do not understand how high the pressure is, how difficult it is to play under pressure. We, as supporters of the Brazil team, put pressure on everyone. We have been there, so we know the difficulties. We have to support them.”Dunga stressed that patience is key when trying to create a world-beating unit, something that Brazil have not managed to construct over the last 20 years. “We have to understand how hard it is to be a champion. We had a very strong group and it takes time to build that. It takes time to build champions and legends,” said Dunga, a 1994 WC winner.“Brazil struggled between 1970 and 1994, they did not win (the WC) for many years. Talent and technique are important, but only those are not enough to become a champion. It is important to have a ‘team’, which understands what discipline and sacrifice are. Sometimes, one shot is all that is there for us to win,” added Dunga, who also served as Brazil chief coach.Gilberto emphasised that the recent thrashing against Argentina cannot be considered the end of the world for Brazil. “It does not matter when we win a couple of games. When we lose one game, it is a big story. While preparing for the 2010 World Cup, we beat Argentina 3-1. From time to time, these kinds of situations happen. One defeat cannot define what we are at the moment.

Barcelona secured a commanding 4-1 victory over Girona at the Olympic Stadium on Sunday, with Robert Lewandowski scoring twice to help his team move three points clear at the top of La Liga. The win came after Real Madrid had temporarily drawn level on points following their victory against Leganes on Saturday.Barcelona extended their unbeaten run to 20 matches this year, with goals coming from a Ladislav Krejci own goal, Lewandowski's double, and Ferran Torres's strike. Girona's Arnaut Danjuma managed to score an equalizer during the match.Lewandowski, who remains three goals ahead in Spain's golden boot race against Real Madrid's Kylian Mbappe, shared his thoughts on the victory: ""We played with patience, we had a plan and if we play with that plan we can always score a lot of goals and win the game.""The 36-year-old Polish striker expressed confidence about his future in the sport: ""I know a lot of people are talking about my age but... I want to play more years at the top level. I feel very good physically, I think looking at the stats there's no difference now to a few years ago.""Girona, currently sitting in 13th place, had previously beaten Barcelona twice last season but failed to replicate that form. Their coach Michel Sanchez acknowledged Barcelona's superiority: ""They were superior. There's a difference between the teams and that's the truth... Barcelona dream of titles every year.""Manager Hansi Flick rotated his squad with an upcoming Copa del Rey semi-final against Atletico Madrid in mind. The first half saw Barcelona dominating possession, with Lamine Yamal and Fermin Lopez providing attacking threats.A controversial moment arose when Barcelona appealed for a penalty after Fermin was brought down by Yaser Asprilla. While VAR showed contact inside the area, the referee ruled that Lopez had fouled Asprilla.Barcelona broke the deadlock before halftime when Yamal's free-kick was deflected into his own net by Krejci. Girona equalized through Danjuma early in the second half, but Lewandowski quickly restored Barcelona's lead with a clever finish.The Polish striker added his second goal after being set up by substitute Frenkie de Jong. Torres completed the scoring, while Yamal hit the crossbar in the closing stages.This performance marked the 20th time this season that Flick's team has scored four or more goals in 45 games, as they pursue a potential treble.Flick expressed his satisfaction with the team's attacking mentality: ""This is what I love about my team, they always want to score goals, it's always like that. This is the mentality and the attitude of the team and it's good, I think everyone loves it, you love it, the fans love it, the club loves it, and everyone is happy at the moment.""In other La Liga matches, Athletic Bilbao drew 0-0 with Osasuna at home, while Villarreal defeated Getafe 2-1 to close the gap on fourth place to six points.Real Betis continued their impressive form with a sixth consecutive victory, beating local rivals Sevilla 2-1 in a derby match.Valencia moved to 15th place after securing a 1-0 victory over Mallorca, putting them four points clear of the relegation zone.",Barcelona defeated Girona 4-1 at the Olympic Stadium on Sunday.

NEW DELHI: Jannik Sinner , the three-time Grand Slam champion , received a three-month ban after testing positive twice for the banned substance clostebol .The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) agreed to the ban after Sinner admitted ""partial responsibility"" for team mistakes.Umberto Ferrara , Sinner's former physical trainer, has spoken publicly about the scandal for the first time. He claims to be blameless and places the responsibility squarely on Sinner's former physiotherapist, Giacomo Naldi .""I was perfectly aware that it was banned so I always kept it safely stashed away in my wash bag. I suggested to Naldi to use it for a cut which had not healed and was affecting his work. I was absolutely clear when I spoke to him about the nature of the product and it was imperative it never came into contact with Jannik. In effect I told him to use it only in my bathroom. Naldi did not deny he had been told, but he said he could not recall,"" he told Gazzetta dello Sport.Ferrara states that he had been using a spray containing clostebol, prescribed by a doctor for an illness, and had kept it safely stored away.He suggested that Naldi use the spray for a cut that was not healing, but explicitly warned him to use it only in Ferrara's bathroom and to ensure it never came into contact with Sinner.According to Ferrara, Naldi did not deny being warned about the nature of the product but claimed he could not recall the instructions.Ferrara alleges that Naldi treated Sinner without gloves and without washing his hands after using the spray, despite the warnings.Ferrara acknowledges that, in hindsight, he would not have handled the situation the same way. He expresses regret over the behavior of others and claims to have suffered due to the ""bad faith of some.""Sinner's suspension ends on May 4, allowing him to return in time for the French Open.

Instead, he delivered a near-flawless performance, using his powerful serve and aggressive baseline game to become the first Czech player sinceTomas Berdych in 2005 to win an ATP Masters 1000 event.Djokovic, appearing troubled by an issue under his right eye, frequently applied eye drops and consulted his team.Still, Mensik capitalised, racing to a 3-0 lead in the first set before Djokovic clawed back. In the tie-break, Mensik dominated, building a 5-0 advantage before closing it out with an overhead smash.The second set saw Djokovic applying pressure from the baseline, but Mensik remained composed, dropping just one break point in the match. With 77% of first-serve points won, the Czech teen sealed a statement victory, toppling a legend and etching his name in Miami Open history.","Jakub Mensik beat Novak Djokovic in straight sets 7-6 (7/4), 7-4.

World number one Aryna Sabalenka secured her first Miami Open title by defeating American Jessica Pegula 7-5 6-2 in the WTA 1000 event final at Hard Rock Stadium on Saturday. This victory marks Sabalenka's second title of 2025, following her Brisbane triumph in January, and her eighth WTA 1000 title overall.Sabalenka, who had recently lost the Indian Wells final to Russian teenager Mirra Andreeva, showed determination not to repeat that outcome in Miami.""I'm super happy to have this trophy, I was able to play my best tennis in the final,"" said Sabalenka, acknowledging Pegula's performance and referencing their previous encounter at the US Open final.The first set was marked by service struggles, featuring seven breaks of serve. Pegula challenged Sabalenka by drawing her to the net, but the momentum shifted when Pegula served at 6-5 down.Sabalenka secured the first set with a combination of a delicate forehand drop and a down-the-line winner.Despite losing her first service game in the second set, Sabalenka quickly regained control. She broke twice to establish a 3-1 lead and maintained her dominance to complete the victory in one hour and 27 minutes.""I think I was able to completely forget about (it being) the final, about the outside things and I was just so focused on the game,"" Sabalenka reflected.The Belarusian has won 12 of her last 14 matches against top 10 players, attributing her success to her performance in crucial moments.""It is all about those key moments of the match, about playing aggressive and staying with the game plan, going for shots without being afraid of losing the point,"" she explained.This marked Pegula's third loss to Sabalenka in a final.

I was able to do that the last couple weeks.""At 26, Sabalenka has accumulated 19 WTA Tour titles, with 17 on hard courts, including three Grand Slam singles titles - the 2023 Australian Open, 2024 Australian Open, and 2024 US Open.Sabalenka's on-court demeanour has evolved from her earlier years, showing more composure during challenging moments.""I think before, every time I would lose my serve, one game, I could just completely lose the match because I would still be thinking about that first game,"" she reflected.Sabalenka credited her past serving challenges for developing a stronger overall game and mental approach.""When I was struggling with my serve I had to push myself on the return and had to play with something else. So now, every time I am losing (serve) I know that I have weapons, that I can return well and that I can break back,"" she said.""I think that challenge really helped me to be more focused and not get too crazy on court after losing a game on my serve,"" she added.The Miami Open men's final is scheduled for Sunday, featuring Novak Djokovic against Czech teenager Jakub Mensik, with Djokovic pursuing his 100th professional title.","Aryna Sabalenka beats Jessica Pegula 7-5 6-2 in the final of the Miami Open.

Football superstar and Argentina's World Cup-winning captain Lionel Messi was in attendance at the Hard Rock Stadium on Friday, where Novak Djokovic advanced to the Miami Open final with a commanding victory over 14th-seeded Grigor DimitrovIn pursuit of his 100th singles title, and seventh in Miami, Djokovic won 6-2, 6-3 and will face upstart Jakub Mensik, who upset Taylor Fritz 7-6 (7-4), 4-6, 7-6 (7-4) in the other semfinial, for the title.During his post-match court interview, Djokovic recognised that Messi, who currently represents Inter Miami in Major League Soccer, was present, referring to him as ""King Leo.""Djokovic revealed that Messi, accompanied by his wife and children, visited the locker room where they exchanged presents. While Djokovic had previously attended Messi's matches, this marked the first occasion where the football star watched him play.""Obviously, it's a thrill to have his whole family,'' Djokovic said. ""It's a huge honour. He's such a great athlete, not just a football player. His impact on the world of sports in the last 20 years has been immense.""To have him watch me live brings me great joy and excitement and also a little pressure. It's definitely different when he brings his family. I was touched by that.""The 37-year-old Djokovic's performance hasn't been up to his lofty standards, beginning with a withdrawal due to injury at the Australian Open in January. At Indian Wells earlier this month, he suffered a first-round defeat against Botic van de Zandschulp.During the third game, play was halted when security personnel escorted a disruptive spectator from the venue. The chair umpire descended from his position and approached the stands while summoning security staff.Dimitrov engaged in a verbal exchange with the spectator and proceeded to direct the umpire's attention to the location of the troublesome fan at the sideline.""It's just heckling, it's fine,'' Dimitrov said. ""I'm a very calm guy overall. I don't pick any fights but don't trigger me.''Despite Dimitrov securing an early break against Djokovic in the opening game, the Serbian regained composure and secured the first set in 32 minutes.The current men's record holder of 24 Grand Slam titles displayed remarkable serving efficiency, landing 87% of first serves with merely six misses throughout the match. He maintained exceptional control, recording only five unforced errors during the 70-minute contest.""Now I know how it feels to be (John) Isner and (Reilly) Opelka,'' Djokovic said of two serving behemoths. ""Maybe my serve has been a bit underrated.""Djokovic extended his dominant head-to-head record against Dimitrov to 13-1. The Bulgarian player showcased his finest performance during the match.""He wears confidence like a stain on your shirt,'' Dimitrov said. ""It's beautiful to see. Only a few athletes on earth possess that quality.''Mensik, who entered the Miami Open as world number 54, has yet to reach a final in an ATP 1,000-point tournament.In a crucial moment against Fritz, he displayed remarkable composure at 4-4 in the final tiebreaker, securing victory by winning three consecutive points.Throughout the match lasting two hours and 25 minutes, Mensik failed to break serve but managed to win with a brilliant backhand winner down the line at 5-4. Fritz subsequently lost the next two points, sending a forehand long after a 20-shot exchange and netting a forehand on match point.Prior to the match, Mensik had a handshake with Messi. ""I didn't wash my hands before I stepped on the court,"" Mensik said.Tennis inspiration came to Mensik through Djokovic, whom he faced in a three-set match at the Shanghai Masters last October. The age difference between them stands at 18 years.","Novak Djokovic beats Grigor Dimitrov 6-2, 6-3 to reach Miami Open final.

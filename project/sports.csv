Captain Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli have had a forgettable home season, which saw India go through an embarrassing first when New Zealand whitewashed their fancied hosts in a three-Test series.Chasing only 147 to win at the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai, India folded up for 121 runs on Sunday. Before that, India's batting failures in Bengaluru and Pune gave the Kiwis a series-clinching 2-0 lead.But a whitewash was still not expected, especially after India pushed themselves into a winning position in Mumbai. However, spinners Ajaz Patel and Glenn Phillips trapped India in their own net on a rank red-soil turner.India's batting failure was once again highlighted by the poor run of Rohit and Kohli in the top order on a track where Rishabh Pant (64) showed that runs can be scored.But both fell cheaply once again in the fourth innings -- Rohit for 11 and Kohli for 1.Talking about the day-three action on his YouTube channel, former Pakistan batsman Basit Ali said Rohit and Kohli find themselves in the same siuation as Babar Azam Former Pakistan batsman Babar was dropped from Pakistan's Test squad after an exteded spell of low scores.""Babar ke baad, Rohit aur Virat ki bhi wohi situation ho gayi hai, form kharab (after Babar, Rohit and Virat find themselves in the same situation -- out of form),"" said Basit.""When Rohit missed two deliveries (on Sunday), struck on the pads and then on the lower abdomen, he stepped out to hit a four. This shows that his feet aren't moving, form is not good. Then he hit a four off a reverse-sweep,"" Basit analysed.Ironically, Rohit was dismissed by a fast bowler Matt Henry in both the innings of the third Test played on a pitch tailor-made for spinners.Basit added that both Rohit and Kohli need to play domestic cricket before boarding the flight to Australia for the five Tests of the Border Gavaskar Trophy. However, there is a possibility that Rohit may not be available for the series-opening Test because of personal reasons.The series begins in Perth on November 22.""Virat Kohli, out of touch, not in form at all. He needs to play domestic (cricket) before flying to Australia; Rohit also. Test-match pratice can't be seen (in their batting),"" said Basit.The 53-year-old former Pakistan batsman said BCCI's diktat of India selection depending on players making themselves available to play domestic cricket should also apply on stalwarts like Kohli and Rohit. Both were exempted from playing the Duleep Trophy before the start of Bangladesh series.""It was the mandate that you must make yourself available for domestic cricket to be eligible for India selection. Everyone played domestic, all of them performed in patches - Shubman Gill, Pant, Yashasvi Jaiswal...but dono (Rohit and Virat) ko free hand diya hua tha, that 'you can exclude yourself',"" he said.In 10 innings across five Tests at home this season (two vs Bangladesh and three vs New Zealand), Rohit scored 133 runs at an average of 13.30 with a highest of 52. Kohli, who also played 10 innings, aggregated 192 runs at an average of 21.33 with a highest of 70.",Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli have had a forgettable home season.

Ro-Ko's wretched run continues:

India's 0-3 whitewash at home to New Zealand is arguably one of the most undesirable moments of cricketing history for a nation mad about the game.While the Sunday collapse in Mumbai proved the last straw, everything went wrong for Rohit Sharma 's team right from the first Test in Bengaluru.TOI takes a look at the key moments that led to a humiliating home series verdict...The decision to bat first on a sticky Chinnaswamy track under cloudy skies reeked of overconfidence by India. The little bit of first-session juice that the pitch had to offer was enough for Kiwi bowlers, Tim Southee , Matt Henry and William O'Rourke to scythe through the Indian batting line-up and bowl them out for 46.India had managed to salvage the situation in the second innings with a fine 177-run fourth-wicket partnership between Rishabh Pant and Sarfaraz Khan . A late middle-order resistance was the need of the hour. But with the introduction of second new-ball, India collapsed from 408-3 to 462 all out, that eventually led to the 8-wicket loss.After restricting New Zealand to 259 in the first innings in the second Test in Pune, the Indian batters simply threw it away against left-arm spinner Mitchell Santner (7-53) in their first innings. There was little or no sense of application and the moment the team conceded a 103-run lead on a crumbling track, the game was all but over for India.R Ashwin has been central to India's success over the last decade at home. But this time he was not at his best and his spell of 0-47 in the first innings of the third Test on a minefield of a pitch was way below expectations. Given the conditions, the Indian spin attack should have kept New Zealand to way below their first innings tally of 235.Chasing 147, all India needed was a half-decent effort from senior pros Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli on Sunday. The Indian captain's mistimed pull off Matt Henry was an indication of his poor form throughout the series while Kohli looked like a sitting duck against the left-arm spin of Ajaz Patel. With 29-5 in no time, there really was no way back for India and the 0-3 whitewash made the record books against the much-vaunted hosts.",India's 0-3 whitewash at home to New Zealand is arguably one of the most undesirable moments of cricketing history for a nation mad about the game.

Will coach be allowed in selection meetings?

Plan with seniors and domestic cricket

NEW DELHI: Even as the Indian team tries to pick itself up going into Australia tour this month, the Indian cricket board (BCCI) is set to review the abject surrender against New Zealand. TOI understands that the nature of pitches used for the last two matches will be debated besides how the team management is running the team.It is learnt that India’s previous head coach Rahul Dravid had tried to move on from playing on rank turners at home. Eventually, during the England series at home earlier in the year, the Test matches generated more runs and went into the fourth and fifth day. However, the team management asserted that it would prefer playing on turning pitches after losing the first Test to New Zealand in Bengaluru.TOI understands that all members of the leadership group were not on board with the decision to play on outright turners. “The decision to go back to rank turners caught a few people in the board by surprise. The new support staff under Gautam Gambhir will be asked about their vision for taking the team forward,” a BCCI source told TOI.India’s obsession with home advantage saw them playing on an overtly dry pitch in the ODI World Cup final in Ahmedabad last year. India’s last bowling coach Paras Mhambrey, in an interview to TOI, had said that rank turners bring in opposition spinners into a Test match. “If you have far better spinners then obviously spinning tracks will be your advantage. But raging rank turners are not the answer. It brings the touring team into the game big time because anybody who could roll his arm over and land the ball at a desired spot could run through your batting. It becomes a lottery of a game then,” Mhambrey had said after winning the T20 World Cup in July.The board may have a meeting with captain Rohit Sharma , Gambhir and chief selector Ajit Agarkar about what happened against New Zealand. It has also emerged that there is certain discontent about Gambhir sitting in selection meetings. There were certain instances when Dravid had to attend meetings because India were without a regular captain for a year in 2022.“The BCCI has agreed to every demand of Gambhir so far. He has been given a support staff of his choice despite BCCI’s policy of promoting coaches they have groomed through NCA’s programme. He has also been allowed to attend the selection meeting for picking the team for the Australia tour. The board may have to revisit its decisions and ask Gambhir for a roadmap,” the board source said.There are also varying opinions about the sanctity of India’s domestic cricket. It is learnt that seniors not playing domestic cricket ahead of the season is being looked at. BCCI dropped Shreyas Iyer and Ishan Kishan from central contracts earlier this year for not honouring domestic cricket. While most India players played the Duleep trophy before the start of the international season, seniors like Rohit, Virat Kohli and R Ashwin were rested. Ravindra Jadeja was left out because he had picked up a niggle. Jasprit Bumrah has always been an exception.“If the board wants to send a strong message about giving importance to domestic cricket, then the seniors must also be on board. There was very little cricket after the T20 World Cup. There is a school of thought that the seniors could have played a game like others did. The likes of Steve Smith still play Sheffield Shield during the international season,” the source said.The board will also plan a transition after the Australia tour. “The selectors need to come up with a plan. It can’t be a knee jerk reaction. There needs to be a plan. There’s no definite vice-captain in Test cricket. With Bumrah’s workload issues, it is a stop gap arrangement for the Australia series,” the source said.",The Indian cricket board (BCCI) is set to review the abject surrender against New Zealand.

NEW DELHI: Former England captain Michael Vaughan took to social media to praise New Zealand’s historic 3-0 Test series clean sweep over India on Sunday.Vaughan described the New Zealand victory as 'remarkable' and emphasized the difficulty of a foreign team winning in India, noting the rarity of such a feat.In a social media post, the former England captain was also critical of India's batting against spin as the hosts suffered yet another collapse in their failed chase of 147.""To win in India is incredible but to deliver a clean sweep is remarkable … has to be the greatest ever Test series victory … India now have a group of Batters that struggle like most teams against Spin,"" he wrote on X.Vaughan’s comments echoed a growing sentiment that India, once renowned for their dominance on spinning pitches, now face a significant challenge in countering quality spin, a point he believes New Zealand exploited to perfection in their landmark series victory.This series defeat marked India’s first-ever 3-0 clean sweep loss at home and their first whitewash on home soil since South Africa’s 2-0 series victory in 1999-2000.New Zealand’s left-arm spinner Ajaz Patel was the standout player, taking eleven wickets over two innings in the final Test in Mumbai and clinching the series for his team with a thrilling 25-run win.Patel's performance was crucial as he ran through India’s batting lineup on a tricky, spinning pitch, leaving the hosts struggling to chase a target of 147.

spins NZ to victory; hosts collapse chasing 147 to lose by 25 runs

MUMBAI: Is this the lowest point in Indian cricket's history? That it comes just four months after the high of India's T20 World Cup win in the West Indies, under the same captain, Rohit Sharma , is ironic..India was just whitewashed 0-3 in a home Test series for the first time in their cricketing history. And that too by an opponent, New Zealand , who never achieved such a feat against any team before and never won a series in India before this tour. In fact, before this trip, all they won was two Tests, the last win coming at the Wankhede Stadium in 1988.The visitors capped their historic feat with a 25-run victory in just two and a half days, capitalising on a turning pitch that proved India's undoing.While the embarrassing defeat will give Team India nightmares for a long time, it is the new head coach Gautam Gambhir who now must be getting sleepless nights, as he takes his ageing side to Australia for the much-hyped Border-Gavaskar Trophy . Under Gambhir's tenure this far, India has already lost an ODI series in Sri Lanka and now finds its once impregnable home record in Tests shattered.India's reliance on spin friendly pitches that have suited Ravichandran Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja for over a decade finally backfired. With a spot in the World Test Championship final at stake, India opted for yet another turner. However, New Zealand exploited the conditions as India's own batsmen struggled against spin, capitulating on a pitch resembling a Day Seven wicket.Left to chase 147, India crumbled like a pack of cards, collapsing yet again in the series twice in their innings-29 for five at the start, and then 15 runs for four wickets in the end. It's the first time since 1976-77 that India lost three Tests at home in a series.Ajaz Patel dominated on this treacherous surface, taking six for 57 in the second innings for match figures of 11 for 170. His 25 wickets across two Tests at Wankhede are the most by any overseas bowler in India, eclipsing Ian Botham's record of 22. Patel has now joined a list of overseas left-arm spinners- Matthew Kuhnemann, Tom Hartley, Mitchell Santner being the others -who have excelled on Indian soil while often struggling elsewhere.In between India's capitulation, Rishabh Pant (64, 57b, 9x4, 1x6) unfurled a gem, showcasing an array of sparkling, innovative strokes while scoring his second half-century (off 48 balls). As long as he was at the crease, the 19,000-odd holiday crowd found its voice and had reason to hope for a victory which would come on his shoulders alone. However, when India was just 41 short of the target, Pant fell in a controversial manner, dancing down the track to play a Patel delivery which took his bat and pad's inside edge (officially), before it was pouched by 'keeper Tom Blundell.The on-field umpire adjudged it not out, but the Kiwis reviewed it successfully, leaving Pant and the Indian dressing room annoyed. Perhaps the explosive left-hander ran out of luck-batting on 21, he was out lbw to a sharply turning delivery from Patel, but New Zealand missed reviewing it.The rot began with Rohit Sharma's dismissal, his lack of form a growing concern, along with that of Virat Kohli, ahead of the Australia tour. Rohit's attempt to pull resulted in an easy catch, marking his second dismissal to pacer Matt Henry in this match alone. Across six innings this series, the 37-yearold has managed just 91 runs at an average of 15.16. Kohli's struggles mirrored his captain's, with just 93 runs at 15.50.Following Rohit, Shubman Gill misjudged a delivery from Patel, and Kohli was caught by Mitchell off a sharply turning ball. Poor shot selection plagued India throughout, with Sarfaraz Khan and Yashasvi Jaiswal also dismissed cheaply.In a brief display of resistance, Pant stitched together partnerships with Ravindra Jadeja and Washington Sundar, but once he fell, India's innings crumbled. Ashwin's final attempt at a reverse sweep ended the game, leaving the Sunday crowd silenced.India's management faces criticism for opting for a turning track despite the batsmen's evident discomfort, highlighted in the second Test at Pune.

MUMBAI: Rishabh Pant dragged himself off the ground after New Zealand successfully used DRS to overturn the on-field decision, seeing the back of the India batter who was running away with the match.The game-changing moment came at 21.4 overs into India's innings when third umpire Paul Reiffel went through multiple replays before deciding that the ball took an inside edge before hitting the pad and lobbing into ’keeper Tom Blundell’s gloves, giving Pant the marching orders. Pant, with his knock of 64, dug the hosts out of trouble from 29 for five, and India was just 41 runs away from the target of 147. Pant tried to reason with on-field umpires Richard Illingworth and Michael Gough, but to no avail.Skipper Rohit Sharma felt that India was hard done by as Rishabh was bringing the game home. “If we say something, it is not accepted well. But if there is no conclusive evidence, it has to stand with the umpire’s on-field decision. That is what I was told. The bat was clearly close to the pad. It is something for the umpires to think about. Have the same rules for every team, and not keep changing their mind. Rishabh was looking good at that point, and it felt like he would take us through,” said Rohit.New Zealand skipper Tom Latham said that Pant was clearly out, and that’s why they decided to review it despite it being their last one. “The footage that the third umpire gets, that’s certainly out of our control in terms of what that may look like, but we obviously heard a couple of noises and decided to take the review, and it fell on the right side for us, so that’s obviously up to the umpires. It’s out of our control,” said Latham.",Rishabh Pant dragged himself off the ground after New Zealand successfully used DRS to overturn the on-field decision.

WILL HE CAPTAIN IN PERTH?

MUMBAI: Rohit Sharma wore a dejected look as he trudged back to the pavilion after scoring just 11 runs. Gutted he was, as deep inside he knew how important it was for India to get a good partnership going upfront that would have helped them chase a small but tricky target of 147 set by New Zealand.That wasn’t to be, as Rohit’s dismissal sent India’s innings into a tailspin from which they could never recover and were bowled out for 121 despite Rishabh Pant’s best efforts. The defeat at the Wankhede Stadium on Saturday led to India’s first whitewash on home turf.Post-match, Rohit owned up to the mistakes that were committed—by him as a captain and by the batting unit. He also stated that the series defeat was the “low point of his career”.“It is quite tough (the defeat) and it tells you that nothing is easy in life. Something like this will be a very low point in my career. I take full responsibility for that as a captain. I was not at the best of my abilities right from the start of the series. With the bat as well,” a despondent Rohit said.“I accept the fact that we were not good enough with the bat. In the couple of innings in the first two Tests where we fell short in the first innings. Even today, I thought 147 should have been chaseable but we were just not good enough with the bat. We didn't apply ourselves. There were a lot of mistakes that were made,” said Rohit.Talking about his captaincy errors, the 37-year-old said: “As for my captaincy, I decided to bat first on that Bengaluru pitch, which was not right. I made certain tactical errors also. Those decisions didn't go my way. Sometimes it comes off, sometimes it doesn't. I was not at my best and probably cost us the series as well,” said Rohit.The team’s shot selection throughout the series was poor and it was no different on Sunday as well. Rohit got out when he top-edged his ‘bread and butter’ pull shot, Shubman Gill decided to leave a straighter one which crashed into his stumps, Sarfaraz Khan hit a full toss straight into the hands of Rachin Ravindra manning the leg side boundary, and R Ashwin played an unnecessary reverse sweep which was well-caught by keeper Tom Blundell “It (shot selection) wasn’t up to the mark, starting from me,” Rohit agreed. Before adding: “But when you are chasing a target like that, you want to try and put the pressure on the bowlers. I played a bad shot but I don’t regret it because that (the pull) has given me a lot of success in the past.”As far as his batting is concerned, Rohit looked to play an aggressive brand of cricket in this series but it didn’t translate into runs. At the end of it, he scored just 91 runs in six innings at an average of 15.16. “I will have to look at my own game and try and see what best I can do. When I go to bat, I always think about how I can put the team in the best situation. I haven’t lost faith in my defence. It’s just that I need to spend more time defending balls, which I haven't done in this series. As you grow, you try and evolve, and I am trying to evolve as a batter as well to try and see what else I can do,” Rohit explained.The Mumbai lad is looking forward to the Australia series . “Australia is not an easy place to play cricket, but we can take a lot of confidence in how we played in the last two series in Australia.”Rohit said he was “unsure” about whether he will captain India in the first Test starting in Perth from Nov 22. Rohit and Ritika are expecting their second child’s birth around that time.Rohit also confirmed that the team management has decided to scrap the warm-up match with India A and instead have “planned a match simulation” with both teams.“If a batter gets out (during warm-up game), he will sit in the dugout for the whole day, and he doesn’t get too much batting done then. Whereas in a match simulation, the batters can go out and play 50-70 balls and then if we feel that he's had enough, we can retire him out and then get someone else in. That is the plan,” Rohit informed.",Rohit Sharma says series defeat is the 'low point' of his career. India bowled out for 121 in their second innings at the Wankhede Stadium. Rohit scored 91 runs in six innings at an average of 15.16. He will captain India in the first Test against Australia in Perth.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114917977,imgsize-23734,width-400,resizemode-4/114917977.jpg"
Ajaz Patel fest: Kiwi twister spins a web of woe for India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/new-zealand-in-india/ajaz-patel-fest-kiwi-twister-spins-a-web-of-woe-for-india/articleshow/114917861.cms,"Ajaz Patel (PTI Photo)

MUMBAI: Ajaz Patel feels at home whenever he rolls his arm over at the Wankhede Stadium. Why shouldn’t he? After all, he was born in the city before his family migrated to New Zealand.The first time he played for the Black Caps at the venue in 2021, he etched his name in the history books by becoming only the third bowler to take 10 wickets in a Test innings. But despite his match haul of 14/225, the visitors fell to a 372-run defeat.On Sunday, the 36-year-old’s match figures of 11/160 set up New Zealand’s 26-run win and helped whitewash India for the first time on home turf. He took 6/57 in the second innings to add to his 5/103 first innings figures.The likes of Richie Benaud, Derek Underwood, and Lance Gibbs dominated the India batters during their visits to India in the 1960s and the 70s and spun their teams to series wins. But since then, not many have come close to slaying the Indian line-up throughout the series. Even the great Shane Warne struggled on Indian pitches.There have been odd eye-popping performances in between, but nothing that has left the Indians bamboozled. Take the example of Australian off-spinner Nathan Lyon, who has taken the most wickets among visiting spinners in India with 56 scalps, but of his five five-wicket hauls, only one—8/64 during the 2023 Indore Test—resulted in a win for the visitors.The last time India lost a series at home was against England in 2012, and that was the only time when spinners managed to change the course of the series. The Three Lions' duo of Monty Panesar and Graeme Swann rattled them and, in one of the Tests at the Wankhede, snared 19 wickets between them.Coming to the current series, India never expected that New Zealand spinners would go toe-to-toe with the likes of R Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja. Patel was their lead spinner but was low on confidence, Mitchell Santner was viewed more as a white-ball specialist, and Glenn Phillips took up off-spin to boost his prospects of playing for T20 franchises.While New Zealand batters did score enough runs, their spinners took 37 wickets between them and had a better average and strike rate than their Indian counterparts over the course of three Tests. Their bowling average was 22.45 compared to India's 24.25, and their strike rate was better at 32.7 than the Indian tweakers' 39.75.Skipper Tom Latham was full of praise for Patel and lauded the spin unit for getting them over the line. ""The confidence he (Patel) built over the last couple of Test matches has been fantastic. We always talk about trying to adapt to each surface. These two surfaces have certainly been slightly different. To get the rewards he did, we talked about trying to keep things simple,"" said Latham.Patel has now taken 25 wickets at the Wankhede, which is the most by a visiting bowler at a single venue in India. In the process, he overtook Ian Botham, who had 22 scalps to his credit at the same stadium.While Santner took the lead in Pune, Patel bowled with the same discipline in Mumbai to plot India's downfall. Even when Pant was launching into the bowlers, the left-arm spinner made sure that he maintained his composure and didn't waver from his line and length. It paid off with the keeper-batter's scalp and doused India's hopes.","Ajaz Patel's 11/160 set up New Zealand's 26-run win over India.

Virat Kohli's 'lack of decisive footwork' a worry: Ian Chappell,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/new-zealand-in-india/virat-kohlis-lack-of-decisive-footwork-a-worry-ian-chappell/articleshow/114915996.cms,"Virat Kohli (PTI Photo)

NEW DELHI: The Indian team on Sunday succumbed to an unprecedented 3-0 series defeat at home against New Zealand as batters faltered yet again, this time, in a tricky 147 chase in Mumbai.While only three batters managed double-digit scores, stars Rohit Sharma Virat Kohli and young guns Shubman Gill and Sarfaraz Khan failed miserably.Going through a run rut, Kohli had scored 4 in the first innings of the Mumbai Test and was dismissed for a lowly 1 in the second essay, contributing massively in India's loss.Former Australian captain Ian Chappell has reasoned Kohli's indecisive footwork for his poor form.“Star batter Virat Kohli's first-innings dismissal was the perfect example of India's lack of decisive footwork. Kohli was clean bowled by a delivery from Santner that if the batter had taken even a small pace out of his crease he could have hit on the full. However, instead of Kohli's lack of decisive footwork being the culprit, his shot selection was questioned,” Chappell wrote in his column for ESPNCricinfo.India’s poor footwork against spin allowed New Zealand to exploit a turning pitch that appeared to baffle the home side.Chappell highlighted how, in past seasons, Indian batsmen excelled on challenging surfaces due to precise footwork, a skill that allowed them to dominate at home.However, as Kohli, Rohit and others failed to adapt to New Zealand’s bowling attack, the lack of front-foot commitment became painfully clear.The shocking series whitewash also underscored a worrying trend for India’s aging batting core. Kohli and Rohit, long considered pillars of India’s success, struggled throughout the season.Rohit managed only 133 runs in five matches, averaging a disappointing 13.3, while Kohli fared slightly better with 192 runs at 21.3.The figures reflect a significant dip in form, particularly troubling with the Border-Gavaskar Trophy series against Australia fast approaching.Chappell’s comments echoed a larger concern: India’s Test batting lineup may be facing an inevitable transition.For Kohli, who turns 36 next week, the upcoming Australia tour could be a defining moment for his Test career.","India lose 3-0 series against New Zealand.

Embrace the lows, knowing they are preparing you for the highs.""His words resonated with fans who saw him as a bright spot amid India’s struggles.Former Pakistan cricketer Basit Ali joined the chorus of praise, singling out Pant’s crucial knocks of 60 in the first innings and 64 in the second as shining examples of his talent and maturity.“People might say he’s worth 25 crore, but in my opinion, he should go for 50 crore,” Basit remarked, noting that Pant's value was evident in his composed shot selection and his ability to navigate tough conditions effectively.""When he was batting on this surface, it looked as if it was a flat pitch—he was hitting wherever he wanted,"" Basit added, praising Pant’s ability to make difficult conditions look deceptively manageable.Pant’s performance during the third Test at Mumbai's Wankhede Stadium placed him in an elite club, as he became only the third player to hit 50 sixes in the World Test Championship (WTC), joining cricket heavyweights Ben Stokes and Rohit Sharma Despite Pant's best efforts, India faltered in their chase of 147, succumbing to New Zealand’s well-orchestrated bowling attack.The visitors leveraged the turning wicket to bowl India out for 121, securing a 25-run victory and a historic 3-0 series win.",Rishabh Pant emerged as a standout performer in India's 3-0 series loss to New Zealand.

Moises Caicedo 's goal prevented Manchester United from securing a win in their first Premier League game since Erik ten Hag 's exit. Chelsea earned a 1-1 draw at Old Trafford on Sunday.Interim manager Ruud van Nistelrooy celebrated on the touchline after Bruno Fernandes scored a penalty, 20 minutes before the end. Caicedo then equalized for Chelsea, moving them above Arsenal into fourth place based on goal difference.Manchester United remain 13th in the table, six points away from the top four. Their 12 points in 10 games mark their worst league start since the 1986/87 season. Ruben Amorim , who will take over from van Nistelrooy later this month, was not present as he is preparing for a Champions League match with Sporting Lisbon against Manchester City.Despite a better performance compared to heavy home defeats by Liverpool and Tottenham, United still showed issues that led to Ten Hag's dismissal. Van Nistelrooy previously led United to a 5-2 win over Leicester to reach the League Cup quarter-finals.Chelsea, having lost just once in nine Premier League games, posed a tougher challenge for a United side lacking in confidence. In a tepid first half, both teams hit the woodwork with attempts from Noni Madueke and Marcus Rashford.Chelsea's Pedro Neto nearly scored early in the second half, but his shot missed the post. Cole Palmer, a pivotal player for Chelsea, was kept in check by United's midfield duo Casemiro and Manuel Ugarte.Van Nistelrooy acknowledged the ongoing struggle with goal-scoring, saying, ""Over the last games we played we lost some points where we didn't convert our chances. When you create a lot, all through the season so far, I'm not too worried the players will get in a flow with results and confidence growing. Results will come.""Alejandro Garnacho missed a key chance for United, while Fernandes scored from the penalty after a foul on Rasmus Hojlund. Caicedo's quick reply came from a clearance off a corner, scoring from the edge of the box.Chelsea manager Enzo Maresca praised Caicedo, stating, ""Since we arrived Moi is doing fantastic. The problem with Moi is because the club paid big money, people expect them to be the best. It is normal to be a bit up and down. We are trying to improve him and he is showing how good he is.""Chelsea could have added another when Enzo Fernandez missed a close chance.

Alaaeddine Ajaraie continued to fuel NorthEast United ’s brightly shining lamp during the Diwali festivities as his consecutive double strike helped the hosts beat Odisha FC in a five-goal thriller in Guwahati on Sunday.The Moroccan forward followed up his double in the last match against Jamshedpur FC with another brace at Indira Gandhi Athletic Stadium as the hosts overcame the Juggernauts 3-2 with Guillermo Fernandez adding another for the Highlanders. Hugo Boumous and Diego Mauricio scored one each for Odisha but could not help their team salvage a point from the game.The hosts started the match on a strong note and allowed Odisha no time on the ball. The attacking quartet of Parthib Gogoi, Nestor Albiach, Jithin MS and Ajaraie made life difficult for the Odisha defenders.The home side was rewarded for their high pressing game when Ajaraie combined with local sensation Gogoi and found a little space just outside the box. Following a couple of touches, Ajaraie took a powerful shot from distance which beat Amrinder Singh all ends up for the lead in 12th minute. This was Ajaraie’s goal in seven consecutive league appearances, beating Elano Blumer’s earlier record of six games.Upbeat with the early lead, NEUFC added more firepower in the attacking third and Ajaraie finally completed his brace following Mohammed Bemammer and Jithin’s touches on the ball. With only Amrinder to beat from left, Ajaraie obliged in the 40th minute.Down by two goals, Odisha assistant coach Anthony Fernandes brought in midfielder Hugo Boumous and defenders Saviour Gama and Thoiba Singh at the break. The changes worked for the visitors as Gama and Boumous combined to pull one back at the hour mark.Energised by the strike, Odisha FC pushed forward to draw level, but it was never to be.

After four wins from five matches, Jamshedpur FC were humbled in their last game when they were thrashed 0-5 by Northeast United FC in Guwahati last Saturday.It was a disappointing show from the former Shield winners and they will hope to bounce back strongly against Chennaiyin FC in Jamshedpur on Monday.With just eight points from six matches, the team from the South hasn’t had a great start to the tournament and is coming into the match after a loss against Punjab FC. Owen Coyle, who had led Jamshedpur to their Shield triumph, will thus be hoping to get Chennaiyin’s season back on track and get the better of a team who will surely be hurting from their big away loss.JFC coach Khalid Jamil though believes that his team will be able to make a strong comeback in front of their home fans at the Furnace.“It’s true that we suffered a tough loss, but we are determined to improve and stage a strong comeback. Losses like these are hard, but they’re also opportunities to learn and grow. We’re working hard to turn things around,” Jamil said during a press conference on Sunday.However, the home team will have to take the field without their mercurial defender Stephen Eze after he was given a red card during the last game. How the team copes with his absence against a team that has the likes of Wilmar Jordan Gil, who has netted in three straight matches, and former JFC player Daniel Chima Chukwu will indeed be interesting to see.As far as Jamshedpur’s attacking is concerned, they will be relying on the likes of Jordan Murray and Javier Siverio. They will once again be supported by Javi Hernández, Rei Tachikawa, Mohammed Sanan and Imran Khan. Barring the poor show in their last game, JFC have done quite well going forward and have scored 10 goals in six matches.And they will have to fire in unison on Monday if they are to bag their fifth win of the season and put the humiliating loss behind them. “Each player knows their responsibility, and we are united in our commitment to learn from the past and work as a team to deliver a better result,” Jamil added.Hopefully they will be able to do that because Coyle, despite all his admiration of Jamil and JFC, is eyeing nothing but all the three points on offer.“Khalid is an excellent coach. He has shown it at a number of clubs. Jamshedpur FC have given him an opportunity that he has grabbed with both hands. For the duration of the game, we will be doing everything to win,” Coyle said.",Jamshedpur FC were humbled in their last game when they were thrashed 0-5 by Northeast United FC in Guwahati last Saturday.

There is not much to separate the teams that will take the field at Indira Gandhi Athletic Stadium on Sunday.With two wins, two losses, two draws and eight points from their six Indian Super League matches so far this season, NorhEast United FC and Odisha FC occupy the sixth and eighth spots on the league table, courtesy the Highlanders’ better goal difference.Yet, a win in Guwahati on Sunday will go a long way in their season aspirations and that’s exactly what both teams will be playing for.“It’s a game where the one who concedes will lose the three points,” NEUFC head coach Juan Pedro Benali said in the pre-match press conference on Saturday.Spaniard Benali thus emphasised the importance of defence in a match with some of the best attackers in the league — the likes of current league topscorer Alaeddine Ajaraie , NEUFC’s all-time topscorer Parthib Gogoi , Nestor Albiach in home colours and ISL scoring machines Roy Krishna and Diego Mauricio as well as Mourtada Fall in setpieces for the Juggernauts.His stress on the same has been further heightened by NEUFC’s best-ever ISL result — a 5-0 win against Jamshedpur FC — which came at home in the last game, together with their first cleansheet of the season.“The most important thing is we played well, we did what we should do in all the games. Most importantly, we didn’t concede and (I am) happy and proud of the players,” said Benali.With Guillermo Fernandez, too, declared fit for Sunday, the Spanish coach will have a full squad at his disposal to continue the momentum of their best start to an ISL campaign. “The most important thing for us is to win three points at home. It will be a tough game but we are ready for it,” added Benali.Odisha, too, will be riding on the confidence from their recent 2-1 home victory over East Bengal FC and a hard-fought draw against defending champions Mumbai City FC, where they played the last 10 minutes with 10 men.However, they will be without head coach Sergio Lobera, who is suspended for this match, along with their influential midfielder Ahmed Jahouh who earned a red card.But assistant coach Anthony Fernandes, who will step in for this fixture, expressed confidence in the squad’s ability to adjust, and stressed that they have a plan not just against the dangerous Ajaraie but against the entire team.“NorthEast United are playing really well. They are a good team with a good momentum after their 5-0 win. For me (the plans to be formed) are not for any one player, but for their entire team as such,” Fernandez said on Saturday.Sunday will also be the only time in November that the frantic Highlanders fans will have a chance to see their in-form team in action at home with NEUFC set to play three away fixtures from then on.",NorhEast United FC and Odisha FC occupy the sixth and eighth spots on the league table. A win in Guwahati on Sunday will go a long way in their season aspirations. NEUFC’s best-ever ISL result — a 5-0 win against Jamshedpur FC — came at home in the last game.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114889213,imgsize-46862,width-400,resizemode-4/114889213.jpg"

NEW CASTLE: Newcastle put a huge dent in Arsenal 's title aspirations on Saturday, winning 1-0 to give leaders Manchester City the chance to move eight points clear of the Gunners at the top of the Premier League Alexander Isak scored what proved to be the winning goal in the 12th minute, heading home Anthony Gordon's pinpoint cross from the right.Arsenal struggled to get out of first gear and although they dominated possession, they produced just one shot on target in the entire game.Mikel Arteta's men have now picked up just one point in their past three games as their title push quickly runs out of steam.If defending champions City win at Bournemouth later on Saturday they will be eight points clear of the Gunners. Liverpool, a point behind City, host Brighton at Anfield.Arsenal have pushed Pep Guardiola's City hard in each of the past two seasons and appeared to be well-equipped for another title challenge but the gap already looks alarmingly big.The injury-hit visitors started brightly in the opening seconds at St James' Park, with Leandro Trossard dragging the ball wide.But the home side, who had not won for five matches, quickly settled and Sweden forward Isak got between Gabriel and William Saliba to head home from Gordon's exquisite first-time cross.Arsenal winger Bukayo Saka lacked penetration but headed just wide in the 18th minute after leaping above his marker.Newcastle defender Lewis Hall blocked Mikel Merino's shot on the line after a Declan Rice corner caused chaos but the visitors lacked rhythm and failed to match the intensity shown by the home side.Arteta opted against making changes at half-time and Newcastle came close to doubling their lead almost immediately, with Joe Willock's shot saved by David Raya.The Spanish boss threw on 17-year-old Ethan Nwaneri and Oleksandr Zinchenko for Gabriel Martinelli and Merino just after the hour mark.Isak fired a shot at Raya that the Arsenal goalkeeper pushed away before Rice muscled his way into the Newcastle area and flashed a shot wide.Arteta made further changes, introducing defender Ben White and forward Gabriel Jesus in the desperate push for an equaliser.Arsenal struggled to build up a head of steam as the clock ticked down but they squandered a golden chance to equalise when Rice headed just wide from a Saka cross in stoppage time.The Gunners, still missing captain Martin Odegaard, suffered a shock defeat against Bournemouth last month and drew 2-2 with Liverpool last week.They have tough games coming up against Inter Milan in the Champions League and Chelsea next week.The win lifts Eddie Howe's Newcastle to eighth in the table ahead of the later kick-offs on Saturday.",Newcastle beat Arsenal 1-0 at St James' Park.

PARIS: Germany's Alexander Zverev won the Paris Masters on Sunday by defeating home hope Ugo Humbert 6-2, 6-2 in a dominant display by the new world number two.Zverev, 27, now boasts seven ATP 1000-level titles over the course of his career, following two wins in Rome and Madrid, as well as victories in Montreal and Cincinnati.It was a happy return to Paris for Zverev, after he lost the French Open final in five sets to Carlos Alcaraz in June. Four years ago he lost the 2020 Paris Masters championship match to Daniil Medvedev.His victory in Saturday's semi-final meant the current world number three will overtake Spain's Alcaraz in the new updated rankings.The German will next play the ATP Finals in Turin from November 10-17, where he will seek to emulate his past successes in 2018 and 2021 at the Tour's season-ending showpiece.And Zverev will head into the event as the player with the most wins this year as Sunday's victory in the French capital was his 66th in 2024, taking him one ahead of world number one Jannik Sinner.For 26-year-old Humbert it was a chastening experience at the end of a week that will live long in his memory as he reached his career-first Masters final on home soil.The world number 18 stunned four-time Grand Slam winner Alcaraz in the last 16 as he delighted the vocal home crowds on his way to becoming the first French finalist at the indoor event in 13 years.If Humbert had any nerves at the start of his first 1000-level title match, he did not show them as he held serve in the opening game with a sublime forehand passing shot at full stretch.But the sheer power of the German soon wore him down as Zverev forced a break point in the third game, which he converted as Humbert netted.A second consecutive break for Zverev handed him a 4-1 lead and with that the first set.Zverev was firmly in control of the match, making just four unforced errors to his opponent's 17 in the opener.And as if to compound this, Humbert started the second set with a double fault as Zverev immediately moved into a 1-0 lead.Zverev continued to grind his opponent down with his big serve and punishing groundstrokes, despite the efforts of the partisan crowd to boost Humbert.But the Frenchman could make no headway on the German's service games, winning only four points on return in the second set, and did not manage to hold one of his own until the fifth game.Zverev then served out to claim his second Masters trophy of the season, after victory on the clay of Rome in May.",Alexander Zverev beats Ugo Humbert in straight sets to win Paris Masters.

Aryna Sabalenka and Iga Swiatek are set to compete for the year-end world number one ranking at the WTA Finals starting this Saturday in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Sabalenka currently holds the top spot after winning the Australian Open, US Open, and tournaments in Cincinnati and Wuhan this year.Swiatek, who won five titles including the French Open, seeks to reclaim her number one ranking after skipping the recent Asian swing due to fatigue. Both players have dominated the number one ranking since April 2022.The WTA Finals, running for a week, offer a significant prize and 1,500 points. Sabalenka aims to secure her ranking by winning three round-robin matches or reaching the final. Swiatek must defend her WTA Finals title to surpass Sabalenka.Sabalenka said,""Yeah, that's definitely one of the goals,"" said Sabalenka.""I've always been saying that for me it's about finishing the year as the world number one. I'll do everything I can to finish the year as world number one.""... Anytime we come to the tournament, we want to win. That's the first goal. I'm trying to be focused on the first part. Then, if I'll be able to finish the year as number one, it'll be amazing and I'll be super happy.""Swiatek remarked, ""Obviously we're both fighting for this spot. It's been us basically, over the past few years,"" Swiatek said.""I'm in the tournament. I want to play my best and win. I'm going to focus on my first match and do everything step by step.""She's a great player. She also deserves to be number one. For sure, I'm going to fight for me to be in that place.""Sabalenka holds a 1,046-point lead over Swiatek, who has not played since her US Open exit in September. Swiatek has since hired a new coach, Wim Fissette, ahead of the tournament.Other participants include Zheng Qinwen , Jasmine Paolini, Jessica Pegula, Coco Gauff , Elena Rybakina , and Barbora Krejcikova.Elena Rybakina, dealing with health issues, also aims to make a strong comeback, and Zheng Qinwen, in good form, will face Sabalenka early in the tournament.Zheng commented, ""The trickiest part for me right now is how to really find a way to break through the wall and beat her.""The WTA Finals have sparked significant controversy in recent months following Riyadh's selection as the host city through 2026.In recent years, Saudi Arabia has made substantial investments in various sports, including football, Formula One, and golf. Critics argue that the nation is employing its Public Investment Fund to ""sportswash"" its human rights record.The Saudi government refutes these claims of human rights violations, asserting that its laws are designed to safeguard national security.WTA chief Steve Simon acknowledged last year that hosting women's tour events in Saudi Arabia posed ""big issues,"" yet he also recognized the progress the country has made and emphasised ongoing discussions with players prior to finalising the WTA Finals agreement.""Our decision was made with full consultation with our players and our tournaments,"" WTA CEO Portia Archer said. ""That led to the decision to come here and being comfortable with it.""... We think it'll support women in tennis and enable some very positive things to come out of us being here that will last well beyond the eight days we're here this year and successively the next two years when we host the tournament here.""Additionally, tennis legends Chris Evert and Martina Navratilova have voiced concerns, stating that the WTA's values diverge from those of Saudi Arabia.Gauff believes bringing the WTA Finals to Saudi Arabia can ""open doors"" and inspire positive change for women in the country, although the world number three admitted: ""I'd be lying to you if I said I had no reservations"".Gauff, 20, admits she had reservations about the idea of staging the WTA Finals in Saudi Arabia and wanted to see for herself what kind of progress is being made.""Obviously I'm very aware of the situation here in Saudi. My view on it is I do think that sport can have a way to open doors to people. I think in order to want change, you have to see it. I think sports for me, I would say is the easiest way to introduce that,"" said the American star.""I would be lying to you if I said I had no reservations. I was pretty much on every player call I could make with the WTA. One of the things I said, if we come here, we can't just come here and play our tournament and leave. We have to have a real program or real plan in place.""Gauff said the calls included conversations with Princess Reema bint Bandar Al Saud, the Saudi Arabian ambassador to the United States, in which Gauff asked questions about LGBTQ+ and women's rights in the country.""In the long run I think it could be better for everybody,"" said the American.""It's one of those things where I want to see it for myself, see if the change is happening. If I felt uncomfortable or felt like nothing's happening, then I probably wouldn't come back.""The WTA Finals, featuring the top eight singles players and doubles teams, begins in Riyadh and will conclude on November 9.For the first time, the WTA Finals will be contested in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia at King Saud University Indoor Arena. Riyadh will host the next two editions of the WTA Finals as well, until 2026.Aryna Sabalenka, Jasmine Paolini, Elena Rybakina, Zheng QinwenIga Swiatek, Coco Gauff, Jessica Pegula, Barbora KrejcikovaLyudmila Kichenok/Jelena Ostapenko, Hsieh Su-Wei/Elise Mertens, Nicole Melichar-Martinez/Ellen Perez, Katerina Siniakova/Taylor TownsendGabriela Dabrowski/Erin Routliffe, Sara Errani/Jasmine Paolini, Caroline Dolehide/Desirae Krawczyk, Chan Hao-Ching/Veronika KudermetovaThe singles champion will pocket no less $4.45 million of the overall prize money of $15.25 million.

'One of the best'

Alexander Zverev beat fierce rival Stefanos Tsitsipas in the quarter-finals of the Paris Masters on Friday, while Holger Rune edged Alex de Minaur to keep alive his hopes of reaching the ATP Tour Finals .Zverev's 7-5, 6-4 win over Tsitsipas kept him in the running to claim his first title in Paris after losing to Daniil Medvedev in the 2020 championship match.World number three Zverev -- the highest-ranked player left in the draw -- will face 2022 champion Rune in Saturday's semi-final after the Dane overcame De Minaur 6-4, 4-6, 7-5.The 16th meeting between the 27-year-old German and 26-year-old Greek was evenly matched during a hard-fought first set.""At the beginning, he was outplaying me but then I found my rhythm from the baseline,"" said Zverev on court.""And when I had my chance I used it in the first set.""Indeed once Zverev broke late in the opener and early in the second, it became a comfortable ride to just his sixth win against his long-time Greek rival.The loss ends the chances of the world number 11 Tsitsipas of reaching the end-of-year ATP Finals -- having won the showpiece event in 2019.Tsitsipas and Zverev started cautiously with both offering up opportunities for early breaks in their first service games.But they soon found their range as the first set looked destined to require a tie-break to separate the pair on the quick surface at Paris' Bercy Arena.However, the first break points of the match eventually came with Tsitsipas serving at 5-5, the German claiming the second on a double fault.The Greek saved two set points and secured a break-back point of his own but Zverev dug in to hold.Tsitsipas' shoulders visibly sagged as he offered up break point after break point at 1-1 in the second set.When he dragged a shot long to end a game which had lasted over 15 minutes, his opponent had firmly taken the ascendancy.Zverev, who reached the French Open final in Paris this year, served out to win and move towards a second ATP 1000-level trophy of the season.Former world number four Rune, the 13th seed, needed just one break of serve as he took the opener against De Minaur.In the second set, the 25-year-old Australian started to open up on his groundstrokes, producing several stunning winners off both wings.Rune finally relented when serving at 4-5, offering up three set points to De Minaur who duly converted the second with aplomb.The Australian's first serve gradually deserted him in the decider and Rune capitalised by breaking in the fifth game, but De Minaur struck immediately back to level.A huge net cord that clipped the line on the right side of the court for Rune gave him a 15-0 lead and he took full advantage, breaking to lead 6-5 before consolidating to win the match.""Sascha (Zverev) and I had a great match in Paris, where he took it in five. I beat him one time, he took me last time,"" Rune said of facing Zverev who came out on top when the pair met in a five-set clash in the last 16 of the French Open this year.""He is one of the best players this year, so I will have to be very well prepared.""With the result, both Rune and De Minaur still have a chance of reaching the Tour Finals in Turin, which run November 10-17.Frenchman Ugo Humbert , who downed world number two Carlos Alcaraz in the last 16, delighted the vocal home crowd by beating unseeded Australian Jordan Thompson 6-2, 7-6 (7/4).The world number 18 will face Russian Karen Khachanov in the other semi-final as he attempts to reach a first Masters final of his career and emulate Jo-Wilfried Tsonga in becoming the first French winner in Paris since 2008.Khachanov, the 2018 Paris Masters champion, defeated last year's runner-up Grigor Dimitrov 6-2, 6-3, ending the 33-year-old Bulgarian's hopes of reaching Turin in the process.","Alexander Zverev beats Stefanos Tsitsipas 7-5, 6-4 in Paris Masters quarter- final.

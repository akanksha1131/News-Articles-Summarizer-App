Why R Ashwin retirement was a last minute surprise for Ravindra Jadeja

Rohit Sharma nets session: Indian skipper prepares for Boxing Day Test

MELBOURNE: Australian media stooped to a new low today at the Melbourne Cricket Ground ( MCG ) as they accused Ravindra Jadeja of not answering the questions in English at an interaction. This comes at a time when Cricket Australia is yet to respond to TimesofIndia.com's request for an interview with Usman Khawaja in Hindi, a language he is very fluent and comfortable with.Arranged by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) for travelling media, around a dozen Indian journalists gathered at the MCG today to speak to Jadeja after his practice and gym session. Not invited, some Australian media outlets, without the accreditation, decided to turn up at the event but they were still accommodated by the Indian cricket board's media team.All questions fired to Jadeja during the nearly 10-minute interaction were in Hindi and the all-rounder responded in the same language. The BCCI media manager continued to take questions and even lined up an Australian journalist but the team bus was about to leave and most Indian journalists, lined up, were not able to ask the question. The handful of local journalists decided to lose their cool at BCCI media manager and even directed a cameraman, stationed in the stands, to continue recording the entire conversation.The entire conversation, which the BCCI media manager termed as ""private"" and even asked the cameraman to stop filming, was later aired on Australian channels. Not a long time back, the same set of channels did the same when Virat Kohli requested for privacy for his kids at the airport but the conversation was spun into a fiery exchange.Still not clear whether the journalists today were irked by no question or no response in English. If it was the latter, they could have well used a translation software to get their quotes in the language of their preference. They instead chose to spin a needless controversy.It now remains to be seen whether Cricket Australia agrees to our request for an interview with Khawaja in Hindi. The story will be updated moment we hear from the communications wing of the Australian cricket board.",All questions fired to Jadeja during the nearly 10-minute interaction were in Hindi and the all-rounder responded in the same language.

ILT20 Gulf Cricket Championship 2024: Late drama dents Kuwait as UAE lift maiden title,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/ilt20-gulf-cricket-championship-2024-late-drama-dents-kuwait-as-uae-lift-maiden-title/articleshow/116544673.cms,"UAE win maiden title (ILT20 Photo)

NEW DELHI: UAE emerged victorious by just two runs in a nail-biting contest against Kuwait to claim their maiden ILT20 Gulf Cricket Championship title at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium on Saturday.The closely contested final kept the fans on edge until the very last over as UAE defended 153 against a spirited Kuwait side.Opting to bat first, UAE began cautiously as openers Muhammad Waseem and Tanish Suri struggled to find momentum. Waseem fell early for 1, but Alishan Sharafu’s 28 off 17 balls, laced with three 4s and two 6s, provided the much-needed impetus.Contributions from Tanish Suri (34 off 32) and Rahul Chopra (28 off 17) steadied the innings as the run rate gradually climbed.However, Kuwait’s bowlers struck back at crucial moments. Yasin Patel and Sayed Monib were the standouts, claiming three wickets apiece, supported by Meet Bhavsar ’s economical spell of 2/16.In response, Kuwait endured an early collapse, losing two wickets within the opening two overs, courtesy of Junaid Siddique (1/42) and Dhruv Parashar (1/26).Bhavsar, the only hope for Kuwait in the decisive hours, steadied the innings with a valiant 72 off 54, including six 4s and three 6s.Despite losing partners regularly, Bhavsar, along with Yasin Patel (15 not out off 8), brought Kuwait tantalisingly close with a flurry of boundaries.Patel’s big hits off consecutive deliveries in the penultimate over reduced the equation to 8 runs off the final over.The last over, bowled by Muhammad Jawadullah , was a spectacle of cricketing drama.A wide ball followed by a boundary from Bhavsar set Kuwait within striking distance. However, Jawadullah kept his composure, dismissing Bhavsar as the batter fell for a slower delivery and ended up giving away an easy catch to Nilansh Keswani.With three runs needed from four balls, Jawadullah bowled Mohamed Shafeeq off his very first delivery, sealing UAE's historic two-run victory.While Meet Bhavsar’s heroic knock earned widespread admiration, he could not take Kuwait over the line when it mattered the most. On the other hand, Jawadullah (2/28) was instrumental in a nerve-wracking final sequence.The victory thus not only crowned UAE champions but also left their growing prominence in the Gulf cricketing arena, capping a tournament filled with excitement and high-quality cricket.",UAE claim maiden ILT20 Gulf Cricket Championship title.

Rishabh Pant in the nets: Chat with Gautam Gambhir to fix flaws

Why R Ashwin retirement was a last minute surprise for Ravindra Jadeja

NEW DELHI: Travis Head has been the only Australian batter to consistently defy the Indian bowlers in the ongoing Border-Gavaskar Trophy . This isn't the first time his batting has troubled India, he also played pivotal roles in their defeats during the ICC World Test Championship final and the ODI World Cup final last year.After a modest start with a dismissal for just 11 in his first innings of the series, Head bounced back brilliantly, scoring 89, 140, and 152 in his next three innings.Considering Head's form, former India coach Ravi Shastri humorously gave him a new nickname.""Because his new surname is Travis Head'ache',"" Shastri said on the most recent episode of The ICC Review.""They are looking for balms in India. For foot problems, ankle problems (and) even a headache they are looking for a balm. He is ideal for that.""Shastri highlighted the batter's improved short-ball technique as a key factor in his success.""I think he is very smart. From what I saw of him three years ago, he has improved immensely. Especially with the way he plays the short ball. He prepared to leave it. He has learned to leave it well at times.""""It's not a big shot all the time off a short delivery angled at his armpits or something. He's prepared to either ride it or go for the big shots. And if it is middle, middle and off, then he hits it in front of square as well.""""He picks up length very well. That's one of his great strengths. And he has a flashing blade for the offside. So he's a hard man to contain. And he's in the form of his life,"" Shastri said.Although Head has been dismissed by India's fast-bowling spearhead Jasprit Bumrah , he has also managed to score 83 off 91 balls while facing him. Shastri recalled a particular shot from Head against Bumrah early in one of his innings, which made him realise that the left-handed batter was in exceptional form.""We all knew he was dangerous, but that first shot he played off Jasprit Bumrah, that cover drive, off the front foot. It was in many ways a little bit on the up, off a good delivery, decent delivery. It told me that this is a player in prime, prime form.""""He went on to show exactly that. And the thing with him is there's no, his mindset is very clear. There's no clouded mindset. He's very clear about the situation. This is my strength. I am going to play in that fashion. Yes, I will watch the state of the game. I might shift from fourth gear to third gear. But I will always be in third and fourth gear once I get my eye on.""The ongoing five-match Border-Gavaskar Trophy series is currently locked at 1-1. Australia and India will play the fourth game, which is the Boxing Day Test, at the Melbourne Cricket Ground on December 26.","Travis Head has been the only Australian batter to consistently defy the Indian bowlers in the ongoing Border-Gavaskar Trophy series.

Marketplaces buzzing

MELBOURNE: ""You see that blue stand over there, they are the most notorious lot. Expect a lot of noise and distraction coming from there,"" says the lone security guard manning the boundary rope on a day where only public tours of the Melbourne Cricket Ground were happening.He was pointing towards the six blocks of seating near the Shane Warne End when he cautioned about the madness which is expected to unfold on opening day of the Boxing Day Test between India and Australia on December 26. Close to 1,00,000 people are expected to be in the stands for the sold-out day and the security team has beefed up the man power for the most sought-after cricket fixture of the Australian home summer.For a regular game, there are only 10 security guards near the ropes but the count will swell to 14-15 from coming Thursday. Every block generally has 15 security guards who switch duties between the gates and stands but that count has increased to 20. Ten guards would now be stationed on the gates of every block while 10 will be in the stands to ensure there is order for what promises to be a loud morning.""They just come and drink. That loud bunch in those blue blocks. Beer just flows and expect the beer glass towers to get taller as the game progresses. There would be some who would even be chucked out of the venue for creating ruckus, we are prepared for that. It's sad they don't want to enjoy cricket and then end up losing money which was spent on tickets,"" adds the guard.He wasn't there when Virat Kohli hit that memorable six off Harris Raufin the 2022 T20 World Cup fixture versus Pakistan but says, with a lot of conviction, even that can't match the madness which happens during a Australian Football League fixture at the venue.""I know people are crazy about cricket but madness is unreal during a AFL game here. It even gets violent between fans during the game and I am sure this Boxing Day cricket match will not be that,"" he explains with a chuckle.With the tickets sold out, different marketplaces are abuzz with resellers looking to make a quick buck on the resale of tickets. The premium is not as steep as it was for the India-Pakistan game back in 2022 but the sellers are comfortably making over 50 AUD on every ticket.There are multiple groups on Facebook which have a lot of members from the Asian community and they are happy to shell out the extra dollars to watch the game from the stands.""A ticket which was say for 30 AUD is now easily selling at 80 or even 100 AUD. Recently some tickets were released again and they were for over 150 AUD. Within no time they were sold out too. It's proper madness for this game,"" says a part-time cab driver who works in a IT firm as a software developer.The festivities have already begun in Melbourne, well before the Test, and are expected to continue till the New Year. For the security personnel, however, there will be very little breather because someone has to maintain order in the madness which is expected to hit the MCG","1,00,000 people are expected to be in the stands for the sold-out day.

Former Australian cricketer Michael Hussey has shared his memories of encountering a young Jasprit Bumrah during his stint with the Mumbai Indians in the 2014 IPL . Hussey’s reflections provide insight into Bumrah’s early career, his unconventional style, and his remarkable journey to becoming one of the world’s premier bowlers.Hussey vividly recalled his first net session against Bumrah. ""I remember facing him in the nets and literally couldn't get bat on the ball. I felt like I was using a toothpick,"" Hussey shared on Willow Talk. The left-hander was immediately struck by Bumrah's deceptive action and sheer pace.""I couldn't even see the ball, let alone pick it coming out of his hand. His action is so different, so deceptive. My first impression? I honestly didn't think he'd even make it to the crease. His run-up was staggered and awkward. I remember thinking, ‘Who is this guy?' And then suddenly, woof - the ball whistles past my eyebrows at 145kph!""At the time, Bumrah was perceived as a white-ball specialist, with many doubting his durability in Test cricket due to his unique bowling action and unusual run-up. ""In India, there was so much scepticism. People said his action and run-up would be too hard on his body, that he wouldn't last in Test cricket,"" Hussey noted. ""But even back then, I could see his skills and ability. I knew that if he had the desire to play Test cricket, he could succeed.""Reflecting on Bumrah's evolution, Hussey was full of admiration. ""Isn't he doing it bloody well at the moment? It's just phenomenal to see how he's grown. Watching him transform from a kid in the nets who terrified us to one of the best bowlers in the world has been incredible.""Hussey also recalled a key moment early in Bumrah's IPL career. In a 2014 match against RCB, Bumrah dismissed the legendary AB de Villiers . However, his fiery send-off to de Villiers caught the attention of Hussey, who offered the young bowler some advice.""I told him, 'Mate, you don't need to do that. You have so much skill and talent. Just getting the wicket is the biggest statement you can make. If you want respect in the game and from your peers, you don't need send-offs.'""Hussey acknowledged the send-off was uncharacteristic for Bumrah, whom he described as ""one of the most humble and down-to-earth cricketers I've met."" He added, ""He's always smiling, always calm, and consistent in his behaviour. It's one of the reasons he's such a phenomenal bowler and such a joy to watch.""",Former Australian cricketer Michael Hussey has shared his memories of encountering a young Jasprit Bumrah during his stint with the Mumbai Indians in the 2014 IPL.

Too many people have full opinions, with half the facts,"" Shaw wrote.Earlier, Shaw had voiced his frustration after being left out of the 16-member squad for the Vijay Hazare Trophy, despite playing a key role in the team's title-winning campaign in the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy.Responding to Shaw's outburst, an MCA official told news agency PTI that Shaw is 'his own enemy'""In the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy, we were playing with 10 fielders as we were forced to hide Prithvi Shaw. The ball would pass near him and he would barely be able to get to it,"" the official said on conditions of anonymity.""Even while batting, we could see he was troubled reaching to the ball. His fitness, discipline and attitude are poor and it is pretty simple, there cannot be different rules for different players,"" he claimed.""Even the seniors in the team have started complaining about his attitude now,"" he added.Shaw burst onto the scene with great promise, making his Test debut as an 18-year-old in 2018 during a home series against the West Indies.He made an instant impact, scoring a century on debut, but has since played just four more Tests, the last of which was against Australia four years ago.Concerns over his on and off-field behavior have been voiced by several former players, adding to his struggles.A recent setback for Shaw came during the IPL auction, where he went unsold despite a modest base price of Rs 75 lakh.","Mumbai batsman Prithvi Shaw posts cryptic post on Instagram.

R Ashwin announces retirement from Test cricket

Why R Ashwin retirement was a last minute surprise for Ravindra Jadeja

Stadium Walkthrough series: Inside The Gabba

NEW DELHI: Ravichandran Ashwin announced his retirement from international cricket earlier this week, bringing an end to his illustrious career following the Gabba Test against Australia. The 38-year-old spinner retires as India’s second-highest wicket-taker across all formats, trailing only the legendary Anil Kumble.Ashwin’s impact on Test cricket has been monumental. He claimed 11 Player of the Series awards, the most by any cricketer in men’s Test history, cementing his status as one of India’s greatest match-winners.Over the years, comparisons between Ashwin and fellow Indian spin legend Harbhajan Singh were frequent. Speculation about a rift between the two spinners has often surfaced, suggesting strained relations.However, Harbhajan recently dispelled such rumors following Ashwin’s retirement, asserting that there is no truth to the claims of discord between them.""I read social media only as much as I need to. If there is a standoff between me and Ashwin or if there was ever any fight, quarrel or disagreement, I would be the first person to go up to him and ask what the issue is,"" Harbhajan Singh said on his YouTube channel.""But it was never like this, and it will never be like this because whatever is in his destiny, he will get it, and I got whatever was in my destiny. He has been a phenomenal bowler for India. I am very happy for his achievement,"" he added.""If people twist things on Twitter and make it seem as if I have a problem with Ashwin, then it's their point of view. I am a little vocal about the fact that the pitches on which India play cricket are not good tracks, there is a lot of spin on these tracks and matches get over within two and a half days,"" said Harbhajan.""Because I am vocal about it, there is a lot of noise on social media, and people think I have a problem with one individual. I don't have a problem with any individual, I respect everyone because it is not easy to play for the country. They are all my colleagues. They are all my brothers, some elder, some younger,"" said Harbhajan.Ashwin picked 765 wickets in international cricket in 379 innings, while Harbhajan scalped 707 wickets in his illustrous career.","Ravichandran Ashwin retires as India's second-highest wicket-taker across all formats.

Mumbai: “Sometimes, one goal is, for me, enough,” Mumbai City coach Petr Kratky had said on the eve of his side’s Indian Super League clash with Chennaiyin.Having beaten bottomplaced teams Hyderabad and Mohammedan SC by a 1-0 margin in two of their last three fixtures, the Islanders boss was left content with another narrow win at the Mumbai Football Arena on Saturday, as Greek striker Nikolaos Karelis ’s calm finish in just the eighth minute was enough for the hosts to grab their fifth victory of the season. The performance, however, left Kratky far from pleased, with the reigning ISL Cup holders often guilty of cheap giveaways in transition.“No, I wasn’t to be honest, I’m looking for football, to keep the ball and to control the game,” the Czech later said when asked if he was satisfied with his team’s overall showing, besides the three points won.“Sometimes, the cheap turnovers, I get very frustrated about that. If it’s under pressure, I accept that, but without pressure it’s very difficult for me. But we try to work on that, obviously it takes time.”What didn’t take Mumbai much time in Saturday’s early kick-off was finding the back of the net. After seeing a good penalty shout for a handball by Chennaiyin captain Ryan Edwards turned down just minutes into the game, the Islanders found themselves in front through a bit of good fortune. Picking up a short pass from Lallianzuala Chhangte, Dutch pivot Yoell Van Nieff charged down the middle, then saw his scuffed attempt to find Karelis take a deflection off Edwards and fall perfectly for the Greek to place his effort past Mohammad Nawaz from point blank. Chennaiyin coach Owen Coyle would later rue the goal as one “you wouldn’t concede on a school ground”.The Marina Machans thought they were back on level terms in the closing minutes of the half when TP Rehenesh was too casual in dealing with an Irfan Yadwad cross from the right, allowing Hnamte to acrobatically direct the loose ball towards Daniel Chukwu who headed home. The assistant referee’s flag, however, rightly went up as the Nigerian was offside.The result propelled Mumbai to fourth place (12 matches, 20 points) in the standings while a fourth loss from their last five matches leaves Coyle’s side stuck in ninth (13 matches, 15 points).Fourth win for EB East Bengal FC defeated Jamshedpur FC 1-0 in Kolkata. Dimitrios Diamantakos was on target for the home side as they maintained their mid-season rise under Oscar Bruzon. The Red & Golds secured their fourth win in their last five matches in the competition. Jamshedpur FC, on the other hand, were inefficient in creating and finishing chances.",Mumbai City beat Chennaiyin 1-0 in their Indian Super League clash on Saturday. Greek striker Nikolaos Karelis scored the only goal of the game in the eighth minute. The result sees Mumbai move up to fourth place in the ISL standings.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116554714,imgsize-42838,width-400,resizemode-4/116554714.jpg"

Gabriel Jesus put up a show to dominate proceedings with a his double strike in Arsenal 's massive 5-1 win over Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park on Saturday.Jesus continued his goal-scoring tough after a hat-trick against the same opponents in Wednesday's League Cup quarter-finals.The win pushed Arsenal up and within three points of Premier League leaders Liverpool.Arsenal climbed to third position, surpassing Nottingham Forest, accumulating 33 points from 17 matches. Liverpool leads with 36 points from 15 matches, whilst Chelsea holds 34 points from 16 matches. Palace remains positioned 15th.He struck twice within the opening 15 minutes and nearly secured another hat-trick before halftime when his header struck the post, with Kai Havertz following up to convert the rebound for a 3-1 lead.That was after the match had begun energetically with Ismaila Sarr equalising for the home side, and Palace remained competitive until Havertz's goal created an insurmountable challenge.Brazilian Gabriel Martinelli extended the lead after 60 minutes, before Declan Rice registered his first league goal of the season to complete the comprehensive victory.Arsenal's away performance in 2024 has been remarkable, with this being their sixth match scoring five or more goals across all competitions, though this particular scoreline was perhaps more generous than warranted.The victory was somewhat overshadowed by Bukayo Saka's concerning hamstring injury, forcing the England international to leave the pitch during the first half.The match's opening goal came from Jesus in the sixth minute, who capitalised on a deflected Saka cross, powerfully striking past Dean Henderson.The advantage proved short-lived, as Sarr equalised with an exceptional curling shot in the 11th minute.Jesus demonstrated his prowess when he received the ball from Thomas Partey and delivered a precise shot into the top corner from outside the penalty area.Riding high on momentum, Jesus nearly scored again with a header from Martinelli's cross that struck the post, before Havertz capitalised on the rebound.In the second half, David Raya made two outstanding saves to maintain Arsenal's advantage. The team extended their lead when Martinelli tapped in from close range following a chaotic sequence after Jesus's initial attempt was blocked.Substitute Rice sealed Arsenal's victory with a well-executed finish, ensuring the team entered the holiday fixtures with a positive result.",Gabriel Jesus scored twice in Arsenal's 5-1 win over Crystal Palace. Ismaila Sarr and Kai Havertz also scored for the Gunners. Gabriel Martinelli and Declan Rice scored the other goals for Arsenal.

CHENNAI: Touted as one of the brightest young players from India, 15-year-old Maaya Rajeshwaran Revathi has been called up to train at the prestigious Rafa Nadal Academy in Spain. Several top players have successfully graduated from the academy and made a mark in the sport.The Tamil Nadu teenager, who has signed a one-year contract, will begin her stint formally in January. Looking for training opportunities in Europe, Maaya chose the Rafa Nadal Academy.“We wanted her to train in Europe as it is one of the best places. The offer came directly from the Rafa Nadal Academy. They conducted a screening process for about a week or 10 days. After the screening, they offered her a contract for one year,” Manoj, Maaya’s personal coach and mentor for the past five years, told TOI on Friday.“Maaya has been assigned a dedicated coach. She will also have a coach who could travel with her for tournaments. Maaya had visited a couple of other academies and in the end, we (her coach and family) decided to take up the offer from Nadal’s academy,” Manoj added.The past few months have been pretty good for Maaya as she has defeated several top junior players in the ITF circuit . She went on to reach the final of the National Championships after getting through the qualifying stage. The stint at the academy could prove to be a game-changer and will be worth its weight in gold.“The next couple of years are very crucial for her. She needs to climb the ladder pretty quickly. I think that the focus should be more on doing well at the senior level. She needs to start doing reasonably well in the women’s circuit in another year or year-and-a-half. She has the potential to do well. On the women’s side, I think that she is the next bet forIndian tennis ,” said Manoj about Maaya, India No. 2 among juniors.While Maaya will be training in Spain, Manoj will continue to mentor her from India. “If she travels to or within Asia, maybe I could probably travel with her if that is a requirement,” Manoj said.Up next for the youngster is three ITF tournaments in India from December to January. “Maaya has opted not to play the junior Australian Open (if she gets into the qualifying draw). She has to get her visa to be in Spain for a year, so that will take a little bit of time.”","Maaya Rajeshwaran Revathi has been called up to train at the prestigious Rafa Nadal Academy in Spain.

Novak Djokovic will run out of energy: Andre Agassi,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/top-stories/novak-djokovic-will-run-out-of-energy-andre-agassi/articleshow/116235405.cms,"American legend

Andre Agassi

believes Djokovic will miss Federer & Nadal, the guys he came to the dance with

Excerpts:

Djokovic's longevity:

Andy Murray coaching Djokovic:

Carlos Alcaraz

and longevity…

American men haven't had results like the women:

Graf was the hardest victory I ever had: Agassi

BENGALURU: Andre Agassi wondered if the 24-time major winner Novak Djokovic would miss his greatest rivals -- the now-retired Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer -- in the last leg of a glittering career where the 37-year-old goes for more history.The eight-time Grand Slam champion, in the city for the TiE Global Summit, assessed Djokovic's run and the Serb's recent partnership with friend and rival Andy Murray in a candid chat with media.It's hard to say, Father Time always wins. He has already done so much for so long, it's hard to imagine longer. We said that about (Roger) Federer too. I think Novak will run out of energy more than capability. Cannot be easy, especially when the people you came to the dance with have left, that's a big thing.When Pete (Sampras) retired it was a blow to me, it set me back a little bit. It made me rediscover my inspirations on some level. Djokovic has lost the guys he made history with. It'll probably get tougher and tougher emotionally, but I would never bet against them. Bet against them at your peril.In any coach-student relationship you need trust and trust can take time, but it's nice when it starts with believing in somebody because you know that they know your experience. There's an asset to their history as competitors.Any success of a relationship is based on complete buy-in and that's always the part you have to wait and see. It's not what I know that changes your career, information doesn't lead to transformation, somebody has to counter that. That's the connector. I'm sure there's going to be a lot of trust immediately, we'll see how the results go.Alcaraz defends like Novak, has more power and spin like Nadal, hands and finesse like Federer but just because he has the best of all the three doesn't mean he can do what they did. There are so many parts to the game such as decision-making, injuries, luck. So how long can (Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner) do it (for)? They could do it for 20 years or not.The women's game hasn't had to deal with Roger Federer, Novak Djokovic, Rafael, Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz, but they have their version of it. Serena Williams is the Novak of the women's game and you got Coco as a potential, like Alcaraz has potential and Sinner has potential.How the game evolves is interesting. The women's game has gotten very powerful, just straight power. For lack of a better example, Lindsay Davenport was powerful, tall, precise through the court and now you have a lot of that. There's still room for somebody who can offset that kind of power, like an Ash Barty.The men's game has changed in the sense that guys have gotten bigger with longer levers, which means they're better athletes, they can move and they need more time, they start playing further back. Soon you're going to start seeing the net game start coming back, everything morphs in its own way. But the biggest issue for American (men) not winning is an unfortunate set of decades where the guys were very stingy and very greedy -- 66 Grand Slams in the same generation. There's not a lot left there (for others)!Andre Agassi - the second of five men to achieve a career Grand Slam in the Open Era and the first man to complete a career golden slam - has won it all, including a stirring love match.""She was the hardest victory I ever had,"" said Agassi of his wife German tennis legend Steffi Graf, a 22-time major winner.Agassi, who has won eight major titles and the Olympic gold, speaking during a session at the TiE Global Summit, said, ""We all live a hero's journey - first part of life is about performing and achieving. Then life hits us with broken relationships and dreams. I went through it all. Finally, in the last phase of the journey, it's about serving others.""The 54-year-old said, ""At 28 my (tennis) career started over. Without the struggles, I would've never gotten Steffi to say yes. I tried to get her for years.""On a lighter note, Agassi said he likes to keep his trophies out of the house. ""I don't bring my trophies home, because if I bring my trophies home, then she brings her trophies home - and that's bad math!""",Andre Agassi believes Novak Djokovic will run out of energy more than capability. The eight-time Grand Slam champion is in the city for the TiE Global Summit.

What I can tell you is Alcaraz defends like Novak, has power and spin like Nadal and has hands and finesse like Federer,"" said Agassi during a talk session in Bengaluru.The eight-time Grand Slam victor Agassi elaborated on why excessive expectations shouldn't burden Alcaraz.""Just because he has the best of all those three doesn't mean he can do what they did because there're so many other parts to the game, which mean decision-making, injuries, you know, luck,"" he said.With Djokovic at 37, approaching retirement, Agassi noted that the Serbian's competitive edge might diminish without Nadal and Federer in the arena.""He's already done so much, so long, and it's hard to imagine longer. I think he'll run out of the energy for it more than the capability of it, I would imagine.""It cannot be easy, especially when the people you came to the dance with have left.""The American provided additional context to his assessment.""When Pete (Sampras) retired, it was a blow to me. It set me back a little bit. It made me have to rediscover my inspirations on some level.""And he's (Djokovic) lost the guys that he's made history with. So, it's probably emotionally going to get tougher and tougher quickly, but I would never bet against him. Bet against him at your own peril,"" said Agassi.Regarding Djokovic's recent appointment of Andy Murray as coach to extend his career, Agassi expressed interest in their partnership's development.""They've been fierce rivals on court, and now Murray will be coaching Djokovic. Well, in any coaching student relationship, you need trust. Trust can take time.""I think there's an asset to their history as competitors, but any success of a relationship is based on complete buy-in.""",Andre Agassi says Carlos Alcaraz embodies distinct qualities from Novak Djokovic Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal.

NEW DELHI: Tennis icon Andre Agassi on Tuesday highlighted how sports should remain integral to education, noting their role in teaching children to cope with defeat.At a Bengaluru event focussed on sports and education's role in fostering excellence, Agassi shared his insights.""Even when you have a failure, you have to get up and play again the next day. So, what sports is teaching you is that focusing on winning and losing is really a distraction from what we need to be thinking about. We need to be thinking about how to get better,"" he said.Since 2001, Agassi has invested in education for underprivileged children, establishing 130 schools serving approximately 80,000 students in the United States. He attributes this achievement to his persistent drive to overcome obstacles.His demanding tennis career shaped his ability to maintain focus and adapt when necessary.""Sports is all about problem-solving. Tennis taught me how to navigate a very intense environment and maintain my objectivity and problem-solving abilities. It forces me to be present, but also to understand the context of what I'm doing,"" Agassi said.Regarding his earlier defiant period, Agassi acknowledged it as a necessary phase in his journey.""Vulnerability is essential for growth, and I think vulnerability eventually leads to humility,"" he added.He recognised technology's crucial role in education, particularly in providing individualised learning opportunities for children. This belief influenced his investment in the Indian EdTech company, Square Panda .""I think technology can play an essential role, not just in scalability, but also in optimising personalised learning. That's why I got involved with Square Panda. We are here because of the sheer scale of impact the technology will bring to education,"" he said.","Tennis icon Andre Agassi highlighted how sports should remain integral to education.

P.V. Sindhu, a two-time Olympic medalist, confirmed her plans to continue playing badminton for the next few years, with the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics in mind. Her recent victory at the Syed Modi International badminton tournament ended a title drought and brought her relief.Sindhu hopes this win marks a new phase of success in her career. The 29-year-old former world champion acknowledges that staying injury-free is crucial as she moves forward.“This (win) will definitely give me a lot of confidence. Being 29 is an advantage in many ways because I have a lot of experience. Being smart and experienced is key, and I'm definitely going to play for the next couple of years.”Sindhu recognizes the benefits of experience at her age. She emphasizes the importance of strategic play and plans to continue competing. Her primary focus remains on injury prevention.“My main goal is to stay injury-free, which is very, very important. Los Angeles (Olympics) is still too far away. I will definitely play, but the main thing is staying injury-free and enjoying the sport. If I stay fit, then why not?”While the Los Angeles Olympics are a long-term goal, Sindhu intends to participate if she remains fit. She defeated China's Wu Luo Yu in the Syed Modi International final, securing her third title in this tournament. Her previous wins were in 2017 and 2022.“I'm very happy that I'm finishing off with a win. Now it's time to just go back, relax, and start again from January. I hope this is a comeback, and I'm looking forward to many more victories.”Sindhu expresses her happiness at ending the year with a victory. She plans to rest and prepare for upcoming tournaments in Malaysia, India, Indonesia, and Thailand.“I'll be playing the upcoming tournaments in Malaysia, India, Indonesia, and Thailand. Obviously, we'll have to pick and choose tournaments because I'll have to be smart enough to decide what to play and what not. I need to be much smarter in terms of that.”Sindhu will carefully select tournaments to manage her schedule and fitness. Her previous title was at the Singapore Open in July 2022. She was also a finalist at the Malaysia Masters Super 500 earlier this year. However, she experienced a pre-quarterfinal exit at the Paris Olympics.“Sometimes I was really close yet so far away. I had good matches in the past, but they didn't turn into wins. I came back, fought harder, and it was important for me to get this win. Yes, I am relieved. I mean, it's the end of the year, and finishing off with a win makes me really grateful.”Sindhu reflects on past near misses and expresses gratitude for her recent win. Lakshya Sen , the 2021 World Championships bronze medalist, won the men's singles final against Singapore's Jia Heng Jason Teh.“I am really happy with the way I had prepared and how I played the match. I hope to do well in the tournaments next year. I have some time now till the new season, which will allow me to train and focus on the upcoming events.”Sen expresses satisfaction with his preparation and performance. He looks forward to the next season and plans to utilize the time for training. The Indian women's doubles pair of Treesa Jolly and Gayatri Gopichand won their first Super 300 title. They defeated China's Bao Li Jing and Li Qian.“We really wanted to win, we were aggressive and kept moving well. There was a strategy, and we implemented it well today. We plan to go with the flow and see what the future holds. We don't want to make too many plans.”Gayatri and Treesa highlight their aggressive strategy and successful implementation. They prefer to remain adaptable for future tournaments. This victory boosts their confidence ahead of the BWF World Tour Finals in China, where they are the sole Indian representatives.“This is our first gold, and it's a great boost for both of us. It has given us a lot of confidence, and we are looking forward to the World Tour Finals now.”The pair view their win as a significant confidence booster for the upcoming World Tour Finals. They are the first Indian women's doubles team to win the Syed Modi International title. They were runners-up in 2022.“The first game was close, but we listened to our coaches, corrected ourselves, and executed the plans. At this level, there is always pressure, and we managed it well.”Treesa and Gayatri credit their coaches for helping them adjust their strategy during the match. They acknowledge the pressure at this level of competition and their ability to handle it effectively.","P.V. Sindhu confirmed her plans to continue playing badminton for the next few years.

Sunrisers Eastern Cape:

Durban's Super Giants

:

Durban’s Super Giants held their nerve in a dramatic finish to edge Sunrisers Eastern Cape by two wickets at St George’s Park, a result that has reignited their playoff push and tightened the race at the top of the SA20 table.Chasing 159, DSG looked to be cruising after a blazing Powerplay in which they raced to 71 for 1. Aiden Markram , returning to his former home ground, wasted no time in silencing the Orange Army, smashing six boundaries in a rapid 25 off 13 balls before Marco Jansen produced a stunning catch on the long-off rope. Marques Ackerman continued the assault with a fluent 45 from 26 deliveries, leaving the visitors well placed at 80 for 2.However, Sunrisers refused to roll over. Senuran Muthusamy’s probing left-arm spin and the pace of Anrich Nortje and Jansen triggered a dramatic collapse. Sunil Narine, Heinrich Klaasen, Jos Buttler, David Bedingham and Liam Livingstone all fell trying to force the pace, and DSG suddenly found themselves wobbling at 137 for 7 with the game back in the balance.Gerald Coetzee then produced a vital cameo, clubbing a boundary and a six in his 13 off six balls to keep the chase alive before falling in the penultimate over. That left Evan Jones to face the pressure in the final over, and the all-rounder delivered by drilling Nortje to the fence with three balls remaining to seal the win.Earlier, DSG’s bowlers laid the foundation by keeping Sunrisers in check. Sunil Narine was outstanding in the Powerplay, conceding just 24 runs and bowling a maiden as the hosts struggled for momentum. It took a composed innings from captain Tristan Stubbs, who finished on 47 not out, and a late surge from Lewis Gregory to lift Sunrisers to 158 for 5 after they plundered 53 runs in the final three overs.In the end, it was not enough as the Super Giants walked away with a vital victory that keeps their Season 4 campaign very much alive.159 for 5 in 20 overs (Tristan Stubbs 47 not out, Jordan Hermann 29; Noor Ahmad 1/20)162 for 8 in 19.3 overs (Marques Ackerman 45, Aiden Markram 25; Senuran Muthusamy 2-20)","Durban’s Super Giants held their nerve in a dramatic finish to edge Sunrisers Eastern Cape by two wickets.

NAVI MUMBAI: Nandini Sharma ’s maiden hat-trick went in vain as Sophie Devine starred with a breathtaking 95 and a superb final over under pressure to steer Gujarat Giants to a thrilling four-run win off the last ball over Delhi Capitals in a Women’s Premier League match on Sunday.This was Gujarat Giants' second win on the trot, while DC slipped to their second loss.Sent in to bat, Giants opener Devine smashed seven fours and eight sixes in her 42-ball knock, adding 94 runs for the opening wicket with Beth Mooney (19) to set the platform.Skipper Ashleigh Gardner kept the momentum going with a brisk 49 off 26 balls, but Nandini turned the tide with remarkable figures of 5 for 33, including a hat-trick, as Gujarat were bowled out for 209.Chasing a stiff target, opener Lizelle Lee struck a scintillating 86 off 54 balls, studded with 12 fours and three sixes. She put on 41 runs with Shafali Verma (14) before adding 90 off 55 balls with Laura Wolvaardt (77 off 38) to keep Delhi firmly in the hunt.Once Lee was dismissed by Kashvee Gautam (1/48) in the 15th over, Rajeshwari Gayakwad removed Chinelle Henry (7) to leave Delhi at 146 for three.Needing 64 off the last 25 balls, skipper Jemimah Rodrigues (15) joined Wolvaardt as the pair plundered 58 runs in 23 balls to bring the equation down to seven off the final five deliveries.Devine then returned to the spotlight, dismissing both batters and conceding just two runs in the final over to seal a dramatic win.Earlier, Devine set the tone early, striking three fours off Chinelle Henry before taking Nandini apart with two fours and a six in the fourth over. She was particularly severe on Sneh Rana, hammering two fours and four successive sixes in an over that yielded 32 runs and powered Gujarat Giants to 80 without loss in the powerplay.The New Zealander brought up her half-century in just 25 balls before Shree Charani broke the opening stand with a sharp caught-and-bowled effort in the ninth over to remove Mooney. Devine briefly regained control, hitting Charani for three sixes, but fell in the 11th over bowled by Nandini Sharma.Skipper Ashleigh Gardner kept Gujarat Giants on course with a brisk 49 off 26 balls, smashing four boundaries and three sixes to take the side past the 200-mark.Jemimah Rodrigues pulled off a fine catch to dismiss Georgia Wareham (3), while Henry removed Gardner and Bharti Fulmali (3).Nandini then capped a memorable outing by picking up four wickets in the final over, including three off the last three balls, to complete her maiden hat-trick.","Gujarat Giants beat Delhi Capitals by four runs in Women’s Premier League match.

Why India need leader Shreyas Iyer for 2027 World Cup | Greenstone Lobo prediction

NEW DELHI: India opened the three-match ODI series with a four-wicket win over New Zealand in Vadodara on Sunday, though the chase turned tense after a late collapse. Virat Kohli led the pursuit with 93 off 91 balls, while captain Shubman Gill contributed 56 as India reached 306 for six in 49 overs to chase down the target of 301 against Black Caps.India were well placed for most of the chase and appeared in control until Kohli’s dismissal in the 40th over. At that stage, India needed 67 runs from 66 balls with seven wickets in hand. However, New Zealand struck back quickly, picking up wickets to put pressure on the hosts.Kohli fell seven runs short of a century when Kyle Jamieson had him caught at mid-on. Jamieson then removed Shreyas Iyer for 49 with an off-cutter and dismissed Ravindra Jadeja for four, briefly swinging momentum New Zealand’s way. Despite the wobble, KL Rahul held firm at the end with an unbeaten 29. He added 37 runs with Harshit Rana, who scored 29, before India crossed the line with Washington Sundar, who was nursing an injury, staying not out on seven. New Zealand also missed chances in the closing stages, dropping catches that eased the pressure.With his knock, Kohli became the fastest batter to reach 28,000 runs in international cricket and moved past Kumar Sangakkara to become the second-highest run-scorer overall, behind Sachin Tendulkar.Kohli batted fluently from the start, finding boundaries early in his innings against both pace and spin. He played confidently against leg-spinner Adithya Ashok, scoring freely, and survived a moment of fortune when an inside edge off debutant Kristian Clarke missed the leg stump. Kohli added 118 runs for the second wicket with Gill, anchoring the chase even during a stretch where boundaries were hard to come by.Gill took time to settle before bringing up his 16th ODI half-century. He later appeared uncomfortable, stretching his legs and receiving on-field treatment. Soon after play resumed, he was dismissed for 56 off 71 balls, hitting a googly from Adithya Ashok straight to mid-off. His innings included three fours and two sixes.Rohit Sharma gave India early momentum with 26, striking boundaries off Zakary Foulkes and Jamieson. He also reached 650 sixes in international cricket before being dismissed in the ninth over when Jamieson induced a mistimed shot.Earlier, New Zealand posted 300 for eight after being sent in. Daryl Mitchell top-scored with 84 off 71 balls, hitting five fours and three sixes. He steadied the innings after a middle-order slide, following a solid opening stand between Devon Conway and Henry Nicholls. Conway made 56 off 67 balls, while Nicholls scored 62 off 69 as the pair added 117 runs for the first wicket.India pulled things back through Harshit Rana, whose second spell of 2 for 13 changed the course of the innings. New Zealand slipped from 117 without loss to 198 for five. Mitchell then rebuilt with support from the lower order, while debutant Kristian Clarke added a quick 24 not out off 17 balls to take New Zealand to the 300-run mark.India eventually completed the chase, but not without a late test from New Zealand’s bowlers.",India beat New Zealand by four wickets in first ODI in Vadodara.

NEW DELHI: Gujarat Giants opener Sophie Devine took charge early and scored quickly against Delhi Capitals during their Women’s Premier League match at the DY Patil Stadium in Navi Mumbai on Sunday.Devine reached her half-century off 25 balls after a steady beginning. She targeted the Delhi Capitals bowling, led by Jemimah Rodrigues , and shifted the momentum in Gujarat’s favour.The key moment of her innings came in the sixth over of Gujarat’s innings, bowled by off-spinner Sneh Rana. Devine scored 32 runs off that over, hitting two fours and four sixes.She began the over with a boundary after Rana bowled a slot delivery on the pads, which Devine hit through mid-wicket. The second ball was also struck for four. On the third delivery, Rana bowled a slower, full-length ball outside off, and Devine stepped down the track and hit it over long-on for six.The fourth ball was tossed up on the leg stump. Devine cleared her front leg and hit it over cow corner for another six to complete her fifty off 25 balls. The fifth delivery was another floated half-volley, which Devine hit over deep mid-wicket for a third six in a row.The final ball of the over was a full toss on the leg side, and Devine again hit it over deep mid-wicket. The over produced 32 runs and pushed Gujarat forward.Devine eventually fell five short of an amazing hundred and scored 95 runs off 42 balls.Earlier, Delhi Capitals Women won the toss and chose to field against Gujarat Giants Women in match 4 of the Women’s Premier League 2026 on Sunday in Navi Mumbai.",Sophie Devine scored 95 runs off 42 balls against Delhi Capitals.

The opening fortnight of SA20 Season 4 has delivered exactly what it promised — high-octane cricket, packed venues across all six centres and a festive-season buzz that has travelled well beyond the boundary ropes.On the field, the first half of the tournament has been defined by standout team efforts and individual brilliance, with records tumbling at regular intervals.One of the defining moments came in Match 16 at Kingsmead, a night that will linger long in the memory of the SA20. Pretoria Capitals opener Shai Hope produced a knock of rare quality, smashing an unbeaten 118 to overtake Kyle Verreynne’s 113* and claim the highest individual score in the league’s history.Hope’s innings also placed him alongside MI Cape Town’s Ryan Rickelton as one of only two centurions of Season 4 so far.Rickelton has been in imperious form, adding a second hundred in Match 20 against Joburg Super Kings, and currently sits atop the run charts with 317 runs at a strike rate of 172.28, punctuated by 24 sixes.Kingsmead had more history to offer that evening. Capitals seamer Lungi Ngidi etched his name into the SA20 record books by claiming the competition’s first-ever hat-trick, removing David Wiese, Sunil Narine and Gerald Coetzee in quick succession to cap a memorable night.Season 4 has also reinforced the league’s growing global appeal, with players from a wide range of countries making decisive contributions during the opening two weeks.Paarl Royals bowlers Ottneil Baartman and Sikandar Raza lead the wicket-taking charts with 11 scalps apiece. Baartman, in the process, crossed the 50-wicket mark in SA20, joining his former Sunrisers Eastern Cape teammate Marco Jansen in an elite club.The batting milestones have been just as significant. The league’s 1000-run club has expanded to five members, with Aiden Markram, Rassie van der Dussen and Faf du Plessis joining Heinrich Klaasen and Rickelton in reaching the landmark.Away from the pitch, the numbers tell a story of a league continuing to gather momentum. Fans have turned out in record numbers, with the competition registering its highest tally of sold-out matches at this stage since inception. Of the 17 matches completed at the time of writing, 14 were sold out — four more than at the same point last season — alongside a 22% rise in ticket sales across the first 15 matches compared to Season 3.The Final has once again proven the fastest seller, selling out in fewer days than last year.Broadcast figures have mirrored the on-ground energy. On host broadcaster SuperSport, the Season 4 opener drew a larger local linear audience than other major T20 leagues, outperforming the most recent IPL opening fixture by 59% and the Big Bash League by 118%.In India, JioStar’s Star Sports network recorded its highest-ever viewership for a SA20 opening match, with the MI Cape Town versus Durban’s Super Giants clash delivering a 23% increase over Season 3.Streaming numbers have followed suit, with JioHotstar registering a 50% jump in live video views.Digital engagement has surged as well, with video views across social media platforms up 116% compared to the same stage last season, while overall audience growth has already touched 137% — clear evidence that the league’s footprint continues to expand, both at home and abroad.","The opening fortnight of SA20 Season 4 has delivered exactly what it promised — high-octane cricket, packed venues across all six centres.

United in disarray

MANCHESTER: Manchester United 's problems mounted as the managerless Red Devils crashed out of the FA Cup after a 2-1 defeat against Brighton on Sunday. Brajan Gruda put Brighton ahead in the first half at Old Trafford and former United striker Danny Welbeck netted after the break.Benjamin Sesko's reply came too late to save his side from a third round exit as United teenager Shea Lacey was sent off in the final moments.United were barraged by jeers from furious fans following the latest miserable result in another troubled season.Caretaker boss Darren Fletcher has failed to stop the rot following Ruben Amorim's shock sacking on Monday, with United looking to appoint an interim manager until the end of the season.Former United boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Michael Carrick, a decorated ex-United midfielder, have both been linked with the temporary role.But regardless of United's past pedigree, the chaos enveloping Old Trafford hardly makes it an appealing job for any manager of stature these days.Welbeck, 35, was at United when they won their most recent Premier League title in 2013 under Alex Ferguson, who watched the Brighton debacle from the director's box as the current generation showed how far they have fallen from the Scot's golden era.United, currently a disappointing seventh in the Premier League, are without a win in four games and have managed only one victory in their last seven matches.That wretched form is unlikely to improve anytime soon with United hosting Manchester City next weekend before travelling to Premier League leaders Arsenal on January 25.After a humiliating League Cup loss at fourth tier Grimsby in August, United have exited both domestic cups at the first hurdle for the first time since 1981-82.Avenging their 2023 FA Cup semi-final loss to United, Brighton have now won on four of their last five visits to Old Trafford.United midfielder Kobbie Mainoo started for only the second time this season as Fletcher left Casemiro on the bench in one of three changes from the midweek 2-2 draw at lowly Burnley.Albion keeper Jason Steele made fine saves to deny Diogo Dalot and Bruno Fernandes in the early stages.But Brighton made the most of those escapes to take the lead in the 12th minute.Welbeck was the catalyst with an incisive run and cross to Georginio Rutter, whose header was cleared off the line by Lisandro Martinez before Gruda slammed past Senne Lammens from close-range.United were in disarray and chants against co-owners Jim Ratcliffe and the Glazer family rang around Old Trafford.Fernandes sent a free-kick wide and Matheus Cunha was narrowly off-target as United trudged off with boos ringing in their ears at half-time.Mainoo was hauled off in the second half after a lacklustre display that did little to rebuke Amorim's decision to ignore him for much of this season.United's problems are far wider than just Mainoo and Brighton punished their shambolic defending to double the lead in the 64th minute.Gruda was given time and space to pick out Welbeck inside the area and he lashed an exquisite strike past Lammens as the atmosphere turned even more toxic.Sesko set up a frenetic finale after heading home from Fernandes' 85th minute corner.But United couldn't muster a late escape as Lacey, already on a booking, brought a fitting end to a painful defeat when he was sent off for throwing the ball away in frustration.",Manchester United crashed out of the FA Cup after a 2-1 defeat against Brighton.

""I feel very chaotic on the eye, just spontaneous and can do anything at any moment.""City manager Pep Guardiola has showed a willingness to play more on the counterattack this season in a switch of style and the club's director of football, Hugo Viana, said Semenyo was an ""ideal"" signing.""We are constantly watching players all over the world.

Poll What do you think of Kazuyoshi Miura's decision to play professional football at 58? Inspiring Questionable Unusual but brave

Kazuyoshi Miura is not ready to fade away. At 58, the former Japan international striker has vowed to show he still belongs on the football pitch as he prepares for an extraordinary 41st professional season, extending a career that began nearly four decades ago.Popularly known as “King Kazu,” Miura has joined third-division side Fukushima United on a six-month loan ahead of the new Japanese season, which kicks off in early February. The move brings him back into the J. League structure for the first time in five years and underlines his refusal to let age dictate the end of his playing days.Speaking at his official unveiling in Tokyo on Friday, Miura said he was determined to repay the faith shown in him by his new club. “Strikers can score goals in bunches or they can go through dry spells, and you have to have an image in your mind of scoring goals,” he told reporters. “It’s difficult to put a number on it but I definitely want to score and assist.”Still brimming with ambition, Miura added that he wants to contribute in multiple ways. “I’d like to dribble down the left wing and whip in crosses,” he said, offering a glimpse of the attacking intent that has defined his long career.Miura made his professional debut in 1986 with Brazilian giants Santos and has since played across the globe, turning out for clubs in Italy, Croatia, Australia and Portugal. He was a central figure in popularising football in Japan, particularly after the launch of the professional J. League in 1993.Last season, Miura featured for fourth-tier Atletico Suzuka, making eight appearances without scoring as the club was relegated after finishing second from bottom and losing a playoff. Despite the setback, he remains undeterred.Miura, who earned 89 caps and scored 55 goals for Japan but was famously omitted from their 1998 World Cup squad, summed up his motivation simply: “I just want to be on the pitch, even for just one minute or one second longer.”","Kazuyoshi Miura has joined third-division side Fukushima United on a six-month loan ahead of the new Japanese season, which kicks off in early February.

Arsenal winger Gabriel Martinelli has issued a public apology to Liverpool defender Conor Bradley after a controversial late incident marred the goalless Premier League draw at the Emirates, drawing fierce criticism from pundits and rival players alike.The flashpoint occurred deep into stoppage time when Bradley went down near the touchline after landing awkwardly while making a clearance. As the Liverpool defender lay in visible pain, Martinelli attempted to hurry the restart by dropping the ball on him and then shoving him off the pitch. Bradley eventually left the stadium on crutches with his knee strapped, raising fears of a serious injury.The Brazilian winger was shown a yellow card, but some former players felt the punishment was lenient. On Sky Sports, Roy Keane branded Martinelli's conduct “a disgrace,” while Gary Neville described it as “absolutely disgraceful,” reflecting the widespread backlash that followed the final whistle.Responding to the criticism, Martinelli took to Instagram to offer a heartfelt apology, revealing he had already contacted Bradley directly.“Conor and I have messaged and I've already apologised to him,” Martinelli wrote. “I really didn't understand he was seriously injured in the heat of the moment. I want to say I'm deeply sorry for reacting. Sending Conor all my best again for a quick recovery.”Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta came out in defence of his player, insisting there was no malicious intent. “Knowing Gabi, there's zero intention,” Arteta said. “Probably he doesn't know [Bradley is injured]. He's an incredible, lovely guy and would never do that if he knew the situation.”Liverpool boss Arne Slot echoed that view while expressing concern over Bradley's condition. “Let's hope for the best, but I fear the worst for Conor Bradley,” Slot said. “You cannot expect Martinelli to think so clearly in the 94th minute. I'm 100 percent sure that if he knew what the injury might be, he would never do that.”However, Slot also admitted his discomfort at seeing an injured player being moved. “I didn't like to see one of my players being moved out of the pitch if he might have such a big injury,” he added.The match itself ended 0-0, marking Arsenal's first home blank of the season but still extending their lead at the top of the table to six points over Manchester City.","Gabriel Martinelli has issued a public apology to Liverpool defender Conor Bradley after a controversial late incident.

Jay Shah’s 2036 Olympic blueprint for India: '8 Medals won’t cut it'

New Delhi: Bengaluru FC owner Parth Jindal on Wednesday called on the players to ""make sacrifices"" in view of the ""financial burden"" the club will shoulder to participate in the delayed Indian Super League (ISL) next month, saying without their support, the club may have to ""shut shop for good"".All India Football Federation's (AIFF) bid to rope in a new commercial partner did not find any takers after the Master Rights Agreement (MRA) with the ISL organisers, the Reliance-owned FSDL, ended on December 8 last year.Though Sports Minister Mansukh Mandaviya on Tuesday announced that the delayed and truncated 2025-26 ISL season will begin on February 14 with all the 14 clubs participating in it, the franchises will struggle financially if the top-tier tournament does not get a commercial partner soon.The AIFF is expected to float another tender soon for a commercial partner.Jindal did not specifically explain the kind of sacrifice the footballers will be expected to make, but it could well be a reduced salary for this season. The club features, among others, former India captain Sunil Chhetri and star goalkeeper Gurpreet Singh Sandhu.The ISL clubs are required to share 60 per cent of the financial cost (around Rs one crore per club) for the league to start after a nearly six months long pause.The total cost for the upcoming season has been pegged at Rs 25 crore by the AIFF.""Tremendous sacrifice from all clubs is being asked for to play the ISL in its current format. Repercussions if we don't have a league are very worrying,"" Jindal wrote on 'X'.""Truly hope the players understand the additional financial burden on the clubs and agree to also sacrifice as we are all in this together. We are in this for the love of football and to see our country play the beautiful game and be good at it.""He admitted that Bengaluru FC has been a loss-making franchise since joining the ISL and said the club may have to wind up its operations if players do not cooperate.""@bengalurufc football has been a loss making proposition for all since I can remember - this year's numbers without the players helping out will force many to shut shop for good,"" he said in the tweet which was reposted by FC Goa CEO Ravi Puskur.Jindal also thanked Mandaviya ""for his intervention and his proposal"", which led to the ending of a crisis that paralysed Indian football.Earlier on Friday, leading names such as Sunil Chhetri, along with several foreign recruits of the ISL, had called for world governing body FIFA's intervention to rescue the ISL.Chhetri, Gurpreet Singh Sandhu and Sandhesh Jhingan voiced concern over the prolonged uncertainty, warning that Indian football would be slipping into a state of ""permanent paralysis"".On Tuesday, Mandaviya announced that the ISL will have 91 matches on home and away basis, the logistics of which are still being worked out.AIFF President Kalyan Chaubey, who took over the explaining part after the Minister's announcement, said a Rs 25 crore central pool has been made for only the conduct of the ISL.""Ten percent of this fund will come from AIFF, 30 percent was to come from a commercial partner but since we don't have one right now, the AIFF will pitch in with that contribution,"" Chaubey had said.""In all, the AIFF will give Rs 14 crore for ISL and about Rs 3.2 crore for I League till we find a commercial partner. The rest of the fund will come through the legacy participating clubs. Hopefully we will find a commercial partner soon,"" he added.""In case, we face any difficulty, the government will also step in to assist us,"" he stated.A tender was floated for the selection of a commercial rights partner last year under the supervision of a Supreme Court-appointed committee, but much to AIFF's embarrassment, there were no takers for it.

Poll Do you agree with the decision to change the ISL format to a single leg home and away structure? Yes, it's a good change. No, I preferred the previous format. Undecided.

PANAJI: The sports ministry and the All India Football Federation (AIFF) turned the tables on top-tier clubs during a joint meeting in the Capital on Tuesday, leaving them with no choice but agree to take part in this edition of the Indian Super League (ISL).Sports minister Mansukh Mandaviya later announced that the ISL will kick off on Feb 14 with all 14 teams taking part. When clubs headed to the Capital at short notice — summoned individually through a phone call late on Monday night by AIFF deputy secretary general M Satyanarayan — they were expecting to hear the proposal, return home, study and then consult owners. Instead, they were told time was running out and they had to say “yes or no” on Tuesday itself.“We had no choice to decide whether the (short-term) proposal makes sense,” said one club official who had to hurriedly call the club owner and inform him of the latest developments.Consistent in their stand that they are taking part in the top league, whatever the format and financial implications, Jamshedpur FC were the first to provide an email confirmation, followed by the likes of Punjab FC, East Bengal, NorthEast United, Mohammedan Sporting and Inter Kashi.Later, Delhi SC, Bengaluru FC and Mohun Bagan Super Giant came on board. Five clubs — Kerala Blasters, Chennaiyin FC, Mumbai City, FC Goa and Odisha FC — needed time to speak with their owners and reluctantly agreed. ISL clubs were also taken aback with the change in format.While most were in favour of a single-leg centralised format, AIFF proposed a single leg home and away structure for the current season, estimated to cost Rs24.3 crore. AIFF said a single leg centralised format will cost Rs 38 crore, adding to the cost.The ISL will have a total of 91 matches with all 14 teams playing each other once. Clubs have to pay Rs 1 crore each as franchise fee. As per the constitution, the top league will have principles of promotion and relegation, but AIFF is likely to approach the Supreme Court for a one-year relaxation, given that it will be a truncated league. Talking to the media, sports minister Mansukh Mandaviya said: “Today the govt, football federation and 14 clubs had a meeting and we have decided that ISL will start Feb 14 on Saturday. All 14 clubs will participate.”“Similarly, the I-League will be held around the same time with all 11 clubs participating. The leagues will finally happen,” he added.Mandaviya was joined by the beleaguered AIFF president Kalyan Chaubey, who explained the financial and logistical aspects of both leagues. “A Rs 25 crore central pool has been made only for the conduct of the ISL. 10 percent of this fund will come from AIFF, 50% from clubs and 10% from legacy partners (clubs). Another 30% was to come from a commercial partner but since we don’t have one right now, the AIFF will pitch in with that contribution for this season,” Chaubey said.","Sports minister Mansukh Mandaviya announced that the ISL will kick off on Feb 14 with all 14 teams taking part.

Usman Khawaja's retirement speech: 'I want the journey for the next Usman Khawaja to be easier'

- Full-time job? -

LONDON: Manchester United interim boss Darren Fletcher said Tuesday that leading the club was beyond his ""wildest dreams"" but insisted he has not considered replacing the sacked Ruben Amorim. The Portuguese manager was axed on Monday after a turbulent 14 months at Old Trafford, with former United midfielder Fletcher put in temporary charge.The under-18s coach faced the press for the first time on the eve of his team's match at Burnley.""It's surreal,"" said Fletcher, who made 342 appearances for the Red Devils and has worked in a variety of different roles for them since 2020, including as technical director.""It's an amazing honour to be able to lead a Manchester United team,"" he said. ""I don't even think it was in my wildest dreams that that was something that could potentially happen, even thinking about playing for the club and stuff like that.""But to lead out the team is an amazing honour and something I am really proud to do.""It's not (happened) in the circumstances that I expected it to happen so that obviously is something that doesn't sit quite easy with me, but I just have to think I've got a job to do and I've got to lead the team tomorrow and think of the great honour and pride in doing that.""The former Scotland international is expected to remain in place until the club appoints a caretaker boss, with United planning to name Amorim's permanent successor at the end of the season.The BBC reported that the club had held preliminary talks with Fletcher, Michael Carrick and former boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, all ex-United players, about the position of caretaker.But Fletcher, 41, said at his pre-match press conference that conversations with United's hierarchy had focused on Wednesday's game and they would talk again after the match.Fletcher was asked whether he wanted to try to earn the manager's job on a full-time basis.""Honestly it's not something I've thought about,"" he said. ""I'm focusing on Burnley. I think that discussion is for after the game.""There has been that much going on and it has all happened so quickly that all my concentration, efforts and thoughts have gone into Burnley.""Fletcher won five Premier League titles under the management of Alex Ferguson but the club have not been English champions since 2013.""Everyone expects Manchester United to be on the top and winning, that's the standard, that's what we all have to try and achieve,"" said a bullish Fletcher.He was asked what his United team would look like.""Hopefully it looks like a Manchester United team that represents a bit of me, I think in terms of what I know is Manchester United,"" he said.""So I hope it resembles a Manchester United team that fans can be proud of, that I can be proud of, and I'm sure they will because I believe in the players.""I think we've got good players and I think we've got players who care and I think we've got a lot of quality in that team and I hope to give them a platform to go out there to express themselves.""Fletcher said he hoped to welcome back captain Bruno Fernandes and Mason Mount into a squad badly depleted by injuries and international commitments.He joked that he refused to disclose sensitive information when asked whether his twin sons, Jack and Tyler, would be given full debuts against Burnley.United are sixth in the Premier League table, three points behind fourth-placed Liverpool.","Darren Fletcher says leading Manchester United is beyond his ""wildest dreams"" Fletcher says he has not considered replacing the sacked Ruben Amorim.

Jenna Purdy and Claire Kittle celebrate gritty 49ers playoff win ( Jenna Purdy/Instagram)

San Francisco 49ers playoff win defined the opening moments of Sunday night, not just on the scoreboard but in spirit. Brock Purdy stood calm inside a storm that threatened to break his team apart. The Wild Card clash in Philadelphia tested everything the 49ers believed about themselves. Noise rained down, bodies fell, and momentum swung hard. Yet Purdy never blinked. From the first snap, the message was clear. This team was not traveling home quietly.By the second quarter, the challenge turned cruel. George Kittle, the emotional engine of the offense, went down clutching his Achilles. Silence cut through the stadium. Losing a Pro Bowl leader in a playoff game usually ends stories. For San Francisco, it sharpened resolve. On the sideline, wives Jenna Purdy and Claire Kittle stood together, pain and pride sharing the same frame. That image said as much as the final score.Kittle’s exit could have folded a lesser group. Instead, it lit a fire. True to form, he urged teammates forward as trainers worked around him. The message stuck. The 49ers leaned on discipline, patience, and belief.Purdy answered pressure with poise, spreading the ball and trusting his reads. When the fourth quarter arrived, the moment belonged to him.Facing the defending champions on their field, Purdy delivered the decisive strike. His touchdown pass to Christian McCaffrey sealed a 23-19 win that felt heavier than numbers suggest. It was earned inch by inch. It was earned without fear.Off the field, emotion poured out in quieter ways. Claire Kittle, shattered inside, stayed present for every snap. Celebration did not erase loss, but it honored effort. Later, even in heartbreak, Kittle found humor. He asked for a bottle of tequila in the locker room, a fitting touch for a player who refuses to let pain define him.This victory did not happen in isolation. San Francisco has lived with doubt all season. Key defenders missed long stretches. An offseason reset raised eyebrows. Injuries kept piling up. None of it stopped them from winning 12 games. Sunday simply continued that pattern.Now, the road leads north to Seattle for the NFC divisional round. The deck will again be stacked against the 49ers. They will travel without their vocal leader. Still, no one doubts who they are. Claire and George Kittle will be there, cheering every big play. Brock Purdy will lead. And this team, battered but unbroken, will keep going.Also Read: George Kittle injury sparks panic in San Francisco as tight end leaves Eagles game on a cart","San Francisco 49ers beat Philadelphia Eagles 23-19 in NFC Wild Card game.

Brown could face NFL discipline after skipping media following playoff loss (Getty Image)

Why A.J. Brown faces possible NFL discipline after wild-card exit?

The Philadelphia Eagles walked off the field at Lincoln Financial Field on January 11, 2026, with their season over and emotions raw. A 23-19 loss to the San Francisco 49ers in the NFC Wild Card round ended the defending Super Bowl champions’ playoff run far earlier than expected. What followed inside the locker room quickly drew as much attention as the loss itself.A.J. Brown, one of the faces of the Eagles' offense, left without addressing reporters. In the NFL, that choice can carry consequences. Brown’s decision now places him under league scrutiny at a moment when the Eagles already face tough offseason questions.Brown entered the night under the spotlight. The wide receiver struggled against the 49ers' defense and finished with three catches for 25 yards. He failed to record a catch in the second half. His frustration showed during the game, especially late in the first half when he got into a heated sideline exchange with head coach Nick Sirianni.Sirianni ran toward Brown near the sideline after a missed connection. The two shouted at each other before teammates and staff stepped in. FOX cameras caught the exchange live. Speaking to Erin Andrews during the halftime interview on FOX Sports at Lincoln Financial Field, Sirianni addressed the moment.“Emotions run high, especially in the playoffs,” Sirianni said at halftime on January 11. “We are fine.” The argument itself does not violate any NFL rule. The issue surfaced after the final whistle.Before the game ended, Eagles insider Jason Dumas posted on X about Brown’s recent media absences. The post went up during the game on January 11. “AJ Brown hasn’t talked to the local media in a while. It will be interesting to see if he sticks around in the locker room after this one.”Under the NFL Players Association Collective Bargaining Agreement, players must be available to speak with the media after games unless team officials excuse them. The league enforces this rule to protect broadcast partners and ensure accountability. Fines remain the standard penalty for violations. Philly did not announce any official excuse for the star. If the Eagles do not clear his absence, the NFL can issue a fine in the coming days.The Eagles led 13-10 at halftime before San Francisco scored 13 points in the fourth quarter to seal the upset. Jalen Hurts threw for 168 yards and a touchdown. DeVonta Smith led the receivers. Brown’s night ended quietly. Philadelphia now enters the offseason searching for answers. Brown’s skipped media session may bring the first consequence. It also underlines how a season filled with expectations unraveled in a single, tense night.Also Read: What happened between A.J.

Legal delay adds weight to Stefon Diggs’ playoff moment, and his mom motivates him

January football usually sharpens focus. For Stefon Diggs , it has done the opposite. As the New England Patriots step into the AFC Wild Card round, their veteran wide receiver finds himself balancing postseason expectations with unresolved legal trouble.The tension sharpened on January 11, 2026, when Diggs’ mother, Stephanie Diggs, addressed the moment publicly. Her message followed a major court update that pushed her son’s legal proceedings past the end of the NFL season.The latest development came late on January 10, when Boston 25 confirmed that Stefon Diggs’ arraignment had been postponed. His lawyers requested the delay, moving the hearing from January 23 to February 13, 2026. The new date falls five days after Super Bowl LX, scheduled for February 8.Diggs faces a felony charge of strangulation or suffocation linked to an alleged incident on December 2, 2025. The accusation surfaced one day after the Patriots defeated the New York Giants. A former personal chef accused Diggs of striking her during a dispute over payment and attempting to choke her.Hours after the court update became public, Stephanie Diggs, his mom, posted on Instagram on January 11.Addressing the past few weeks, she wrote, “These past few weeks have been rough, but we all got💪.” She added, “Proud of my sons. Wild Card Weekend, let’s go.” The post appeared alongside images of both Stefon Diggs and his younger son, Trevon Diggs, of the Green Bay Packers.Stephanie has remained a constant presence in her sons’ lives since their father passed away in January 2008. Her message struck a personal tone at a moment when football pressure met legal uncertainty.Diggs responded to the allegations earlier through his attorney, David Meier. In a statement released to WBZ on January 5, Meier said the claims did not occur and lacked evidence. He said the timing followed an unresolved employer-employee financial dispute and stated Diggs intends to establish the truth in court.On January 6, the Patriots issued a formal response. In a statement shared by ESPN reporter Mike Reiss, the team said it supports Diggs, will continue gathering information, and will cooperate with authorities and the NFL while the matter remains ongoing.With the arraignment delayed and no immediate league action announced, the Patriots turn their attention to the Los Angeles Chargers this weekend at Gillette Stadium. Still, Stephanie Diggs’ words made one thing clear. Behind the playoff push, the weeks have not been easy, and February now holds answers that January could not.Also Read: Cardi B and Stefon Diggs make headlines as both face felony assault allegations involving women","Stefon Diggs' arraignment has been pushed back to February 13, 2026.

San Francisco 49ers’ next playoff opponent is set



San Francisco 49ers’ next playoff opponent sat unanswered for most of Sunday night, until grit, patience, and one fearless play flipped the script in Philadelphia. Battered and short-handed, the 49ers walked into Lincoln Financial Field and walked out with a 23-19 Wild Card win that few saw coming. Injuries mounted early, the margin stayed thin, and yet San Francisco refused to blink when the pressure peaked.The game never felt comfortable, and that was the point. This was playoff football stripped of polish. The 49ers lost George Kittle to a frightening Achilles injury and watched Ji’Ayir Brown exit as well, but their identity did not leave with them. The defense tightened its grip, the offense waited for its moment, and when it arrived, San Francisco seized it without hesitation.That moment came on the first snap of the fourth quarter. Jauan Jennings took the pitch, rolled right, and delivered a perfectly timed strike to Christian McCaffrey for a 29-yard touchdown. It was bold, clean, and decisive. A team built on discipline beat the Eagles at their own historic strength, using deception to tilt a playoff game. McCaffrey struck again later, finishing with two receiving touchdowns that reshaped the night.Philadelphia briefly answered with Jake Elliott’s field goal, but their offense never found rhythm when it mattered most. Three second-half three-and-outs told the story. Even when field position favored them, progress stalled. Jalen Hurts, limited to 168 passing yards, could not revive a unit that produced just 36 yards in the third quarter. The final drive ended fittingly, an incomplete fourth-and-11 pass with 43 seconds left sealing the Eagles’ fate.San Francisco did not dominate, but they controlled the moments that decide playoff games. Their defense smothered lanes, pressured throws, and closed the door in the final minute. It was survival football, shaped by trust and timing rather than flash.Now the road narrows. The NFL reseeding sends the 49ers to Seattle to face the conference’s top seed, the Seahawks, in the Divisional Round. It will be their third meeting, and momentum will not travel easily after a Week 18 loss that handed Seattle the division. San Francisco may arrive without Kittle, but history travels with them. This marks their 27th Divisional Round appearance, and experience still carries weight in January.One team moves on. One goes home. On Sunday night, resilience proved louder than noise.Also Read: George Kittle injury sparks panic in San Francisco as tight end leaves Eagles game on a cart",San Francisco 49ers beat Philadelphia Eagles 23-19 in Wild Card game. 49ers lost George Kittle to a frightening Achilles injury.

What happened between A.J.

Brown, Nick Sirianni (NFL on Fox)

Emotions run high as A.J. Brown and Nick Sirianni clash on Eagles sideline in must-win playoff game



Eagles’ A.J. Brown and Nick Sirianni got into a heated exchange and suddenly a playoff game turned into a moment that felt bigger than the scoreline. Early success against the 49ers had Philadelphia in control, but one brief stretch exposed how fragile emotions can be when expectations run sky high. Under the bright lights of the postseason, even elite teams are one dropped pass away from tension boiling over.What unfolded on the Eagles sideline was not scripted drama but raw competitiveness colliding in real time. Cameras caught frustration, authority, and pride clashing in a way fans rarely see so clearly. In a game defined by urgency, that exchange became a snapshot of how pressure reshapes behavior when every decision matters most.The sequence unfolded quickly. Jalen Hurts took his shots downfield, trusting A.J. Brown to do what he has done all season. Brown could not bring either pass in, including one that hit his hands cleanly. When he reached the sideline, emotions boiled over. Head coach Nick Sirianni stormed toward Brown, and the two exchanged heated words, face to face, before Eagles security chief Dom “Big Dom” DiSandro stepped in to separate them.The moment stunned viewers, even those familiar with the fiery reputations on both sides. Still, context mattered. According to reports during the broadcast, Sirianni appeared to be urging Brown off the field to avoid a potential penalty situation after the second drop led to a punt. That explanation aligned with what followed online.“I’m not sure this even registers as a top-10 A.J. Brown controversy,” NFL Network’s Mike Garofolo wrote on his official X account. “Sirianni told him to get off the field, seemingly to avoid a penalty for too many men. Jordan Mailata was close, too. There was time on the play clock and it got reset though.”Not everyone saw it the same way. “I don’t understand why Nick Sirianni is running down and yelling at A.J. Brown,” Fox Sports analyst and Pro Football Hall of Famer Michael Strahan said at halftime. “I think it distracts from what your team is trying to do … in my opinion, as a player, I wouldn’t have taken that very well from my coach.”At halftime, Sirianni worked to cool the narrative. “Emotions run high,” Sirianni told Andrews. “Especially in the playoffs. Of course, after this game, we’ll go back to loving other. But we’re all fine, thanks.”Brown entered the locker room with three catches for 25 yards, the Eagles clinging to a 13-10 lead. The argument did not erase the advantage, but it revealed how thin the margin is in January, where passion can fuel a team or briefly threaten to pull it apart.Also Read: George Kittle injury sparks panic in San Francisco as tight end leaves Eagles game on a cart","A.J.

Patrick Mahomes trade rumors: Chiefs fans stunned as rebuild talk turns extreme,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/patrick-mahomes-trade-rumors-chiefs-fans-stunned-as-rebuild-talk-turns-extreme/articleshow/126473109.cms,"Trade speculation around Patrick Mahomes surfaced after the Kansas City Chiefs finished 6–11 and missed the playoffs. An analyst suggested considering all options amid Mahomes’ ACL rehab. While unlikely, the debate highlights Kansas City’s crossroads, even as coach Andy Reid remains optimistic about his recovery.

Why a shocking Patrick Mahomes trade idea refuses to fade

Kansas City is not used to chaos. For nearly a decade, stability has defined the Chiefs, built around elite quarterback play and steady leadership. That sense of certainty cracked after a brutal 6 and 11 finish and an empty January. With Patrick Mahomes rehabbing a torn ACL and the postseason missed for the first time in years, uncomfortable questions are finally surfacing.One of them feels almost taboo. What if Kansas City had to consider life without the face of the franchise. The idea sounds reckless, yet the timing has fueled debate across NFL circles. A lost season, a long rehab timeline, and roster fatigue have pushed the conversation from impossible to uncomfortable.The spark came from Bleacher Report analyst Brad Gagnon, who framed the theory as a question, not a demand.""Mahomes is too much of a staple for the franchise to move on this quickly, and it would likely cost them a ton of money to trade him,"" Gagnon wrote. ""He's probably not going anywhere, but the Chiefs shouldn't rule it out in the event of a blockbuster offer. Regardless, they need to regroup and rebuild around him in dramatic fashion or this whole thing will begin to rot.""That warning hit a nerve. Kansas City is tied to Mahomes through a 10 year, $450 million deal, and there has been no signal of a split. In fact, Mahomes has invested heavily in the area, including land for a future family home. Those moves suggest roots, not restlessness.Inside the building, the focus is recovery. Head coach Andy Reid offered a hopeful update. ""He's doing great for just being three weeks out,"" Reid said. ""He'll go ahead and most likely stay up here in Kansas City rehabbing. I think that'll just continue until we get started again... Right now he's in that early process where you have to hit it hard, which is not necessarily a fun thing to do.""""The important thing is that you keep upbeat and keep coming back for more, and he's been doing that,"" he added.The theory may never become reality. Still, it reveals a truth Kansas City cannot ignore. The Chiefs are at a crossroads. Rebuild smartly around Mahomes, or risk watching a dynasty quietly fade.Also Read: “I have a great wife”: Patrick Mahomes says wife Brittany is the backbone of his success on and off the field","An analyst suggested considering all options amid Patrick Mahomes’ ACL rehab.

Josh Allen injury update: Bills star answers injury concerns with clutch fourth-quarter response,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/josh-allen-injury-update-bills-star-answers-injury-concerns-with-clutch-fourth-quarter-response/articleshow/126473083.cms,"Josh Allen briefly left the Buffalo Bills’ AFC Wild Card game after a first-quarter hit against the Jacksonville Jaguars, raising concern among fans. He returned quickly, showed no lingering effects, and delivered a dominant performance, including his first career game-winning drive, to push Buffalo into the next playoff round.

Josh Allen shrugs off scare and makes history

Bills postgame reaction: Josh Allen

Buffalo did not just survive the AFC Wild Card round. It announced itself. Under playoff lights and rising pressure, Josh Allen delivered a performance that blended toughness with control, even as concern briefly crept in early. When Allen disappeared into the blue medical tent in the first quarter, the mood inside Highmark Stadium shifted. For a moment, the Bills’ postseason hopes felt fragile.Those fears did not last long. Allen returned, steadied the offense, and authored one of the most complete playoff performances of his career. The reigning MVP did more than push Buffalo forward. He rewrote his own narrative, proving once again why the Buffalo Bills trust him when games tilt on the edge.After the game, Allen addressed the scare head on. “Yeah, it was more of a precautionary thing,” Allen said about his injury during his post-game presser. “I just got rolled up on, and they want to take a quick look, but we’re all good.”The incident happened on a critical third down near the red zone. As Allen fought for extra yards, defenders Travon Walker and Josh Hines-Allen landed awkwardly on his head and neck area.It looked unsettling in real time, especially against a physical Jacksonville Jaguars defense that refused to back down.What followed defined Allen’s night. Calm replaced chaos. Precision replaced doubt. He finished 28 of 35 for 273 yards, added a passing touchdown, and powered in two rushing scores. Above all, he created his own game-winning drive in his first career and this is something that does not need any stat line to speak.The crime committed by Buffalo was based on the legs of Allen at an opportune moment when he was in need of courage. The quarterback responded with poise, sealing a win that felt both earned and symbolic.As the Bills march deeper into January, Allen’s health will remain a storyline. For now, his message was clear. He is fine. Buffalo is rolling. And the postseason spotlight suits him just fine.Also Read: “House husband”: Josh Allen becomes target of online trolling as Hailee Steinfeld skips crucial Bills playoff showdown","Buffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen was injured in the first quarter against the Jacksonville Jaguars.

Critics mocked the absence, while others defended Steinfeld’s professional commitment as Allen stayed focused on the playoff challenge.

Hailee Steinfeld’s playoff absence sparks brutal trolling of Josh Allen

The Buffalo Bills enter the Wild Card round with pressure already baked in. A road playoff game. A hostile crowd. A season that has little margin for error. Yet hours before kickoff against the Jacksonville Jaguars, attention drifted away from formations and matchups and landed squarely on something far more personal involving Josh Allen Reports surfaced that Allen’s wife, Hailee Steinfeld , would not be in attendance. The reason was simple and professional. Steinfeld is scheduled to present at the Golden Globe Awards in Los Angeles, a major career moment that overlaps with the playoff clash. That explanation did little to quiet social media, where trolls wasted no time twisting the absence into ridicule.As the Bills prepared to fight for survival, critics online spun the narrative into mockery rather than context. “She knows he is losing anyway. So why attend,” one fan wrote. Another added, “She couldn’t watch her husband get bounced in the first round by Trevor Lawrence.”The commentary continued. “Way to support your husband. Smh,” one post read, while another claimed, “Yeah because it will be an L for the bills.” A final jab went further: “Well ya cause Josh is retiring next season just like Kelce. They are house husbands.”The loudest voices, however, did not represent the majority.Many fans understood the reality. Steinfeld is a Hollywood star with commitments of her own. Her absence does not signal doubt. It signals a calendar conflict.Inside the Bills locker room, the tone remains far more grounded. This marks Buffalo’s seventh straight playoff appearance, and Allen knows what the moment demands. He recently spoke about the mindset required when the margin disappears.“Just trusting reads, trusting feet, trusting eyes, trusting my teammates. I think that’s what it kind of comes down to,” Allen said. “As we get into the playoffs, it was a very helpful exercise to do.”He also acknowledged how the postseason sharpens everything. Regular-season losses fade. Playoff losses end seasons. The approach, he said, stays the same. Execute. Trust the work. Let the noise fade.Whether Steinfeld is in Jacksonville or Los Angeles, Allen’s task does not change. The Bills win and move on, or the season ends. Social media chatter will not decide it. The field will.Also Read: “Feels like a bad omen”: Bills fans slam Hailee Steinfeld for skipping Josh Allen’s playoff game for Golden Globes","Buffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen's wife, Hailee Steinfeld, is attending the Golden Globes.

Former NBA legend Gilbert Arenas is known for his analysis and opinions. In the recent episode of The Gilbert Arenas Show, the veteran broke down the real reason behind the amount of criticism that LeBron James gets even today. He believes that the actual reason behind this is his name coming up alongside Michael Jordan in the GOAT debate. Gilbert believes that the fans don’t acknowledge the fact that LeBron is 41 and still hopping around.LeBron James is in his 23rd season in the league. Even though he missed the first 24 seasons of the game, he came back and established his dominance within the league. The 41-year-old athlete is currently averaging 21.9 points, with 5.6 rebounds and 6.9 assists.While fans get excited whenever LeBron James hits the court, there is a section of them who constantly drop hate on the Los Angeles Lakers’ legend. Gilbert Arenas, in the latest episode of his podcast, tried to break down the actual reason behind this. He started off mentioning LeBron’s age. Gilbert stated, “I think the only people who seems to know LeBron is 41 is LeBron.” He further continued, “I think the name itself generates so many mixed emotions and it seems to stem from so much hatred that he gets because he’s so close to Jordan. ”Gilbert analyzed how there are more than 5000 players within the league and the fact that the conversation between these two players specifically highlights their credibility.Gilbert further added, “Stop trying to minimize how great these two players are.” He went on to praise LeBron for his consistency at this age, “The man is 41 years old. The fact that he’s walking still, let alone averaging 25, is crazy. So for him to publicly have to say, ‘Its his team’, that is crazy. ” Gilbert acknowledges the fact that LeBron cannot be functioning on a high level at this age.Ahead of the Milwaukee Bucks’ game against the Denver Nuggets, the former team’s coach made a significant statement on LeBron James. The Los Angeles Lakers star has entered his 23rd season within the league and that has been noticed by many. Doc Rivers joined the list as he extended his appreciation towards the legend.

Gilbert Arenas, on the latest episode of his podcast, Gil’s Arena, addressed the never-ending goat debate between LeBron James and Michael Jordan and called out the favoritism towards MJ. He feels that the people are critiquing James with inconsistent benchmarks.The NBA is currently treading in uncharted territory as LeBron James has defied all the stereotypes coming into his 23rd NBA season. At 41 years old, James is no longer just competing against the current generation of superstars, but also with players from the previous generation. The 4-time MVP has played in 19 games this season and is currently averaging 21.9 points, 5.6 rebounds, and 6.9 assists while shooting 51% from the field. But despite maintaining a stat line that would be a career-best for most All-Stars, the GOAT discussion around him remains relatively bifurcated. This friction suggests that the criticism directed at James is rarely about his declining athleticism, but a retaliation from MJ fans over who deserves the goat throne.The latest episode of Gil’s Arena podcast is here to settle the debate. The 3-time NBA All-Star expressed frustration about how people undermine LeBron James when his name comes up in the ultimate Goat discussion with MJ.Arenas said, “LeBron James, the name itself generates so many different mixed emotions, and it seems to stem from so much hatred that gets because he’s so close to Jordan. If you have him in front of Jordan or behind Jordan, who gives a f***? Stop trying to minimise how great these two players are. ”Continuing, he said, “I think the only people who seems to know LeBron is 41 is LeBron. I think the name itself generates so many mixed emotions and it seems to stem from so much hatred that he gets because he’s so close to Jordan… Stop trying to minimize how great these two players are. The man is 41 years old. The fact that he’s walking still, let alone averaging 25, is crazy.""But the fans weren't aligned with Gilbert's opinion. One fan commented, “He is not close to Jordan in any way whatsoever.” “If he was .500 in the finals he would be close to jordan. But the fact he's never been over .500 on the finals at any point in his career. Makes him not close to being jordan. He's barley Jerry west lmao,” posted the second fan. While a third fan said, “Somehow doubt he'd be averaging if the rules weren't so easy to score. ”A fan wrote, “He is averaging 21.9, just saying, still good as a 3rd option.” Another fan commented, “It's not worth our energy. Nobody is going to switch to the other side.”Arenas thinks that people are watching LeBron James like a hawk and every missed free throw or defensive lapse is seen as proof of his inferiority to Jordan’s perfect 6-0 Finals record. In fact, James' off-court comments and life also get dragged into this. NBA legend, Isiah Thomas, recently talked about the numbers that LeBron is putting far exceed the ones put by MJ, yet people do not realise his greatness and treat him like “nothing. ” Legends like Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Karl Malone saw a dip in their PPG by 40, but James is refining the league in his own way at 41.

Caitlin Clark reacts to Luka Garza’s growth



Celtics backup center Luka Garza delivers steady impact



The Boston Celtics are in the race to claim the top of the standings in the Eastern Conference. With Jayson Tatum sidelined, the spotlight has shifted toward players who rarely command national attention. One of those names now sits at the center of league-wide conversation after a simple two-word reaction from Caitlin Clark added fuel to his rising profile.Clark’s response came after a stretch of games that changed how many around the league view Boston’s bench. Luka Garza, who has proved to be the piece of the missing puzzle, has been on his A-game, providing the Celtics with the much-needed push to enhance the roster strength. Clark showered her heartfelt appreciation for the Bosnian-American basketball star.Celtics insider Marc D’Amico shared Luka Garza’s astonishing stat lines on a post on X that read, ""Luka Garza is the stretch big no one knew existed before this season. He's now shooting exactly 50% from 3-point range this season."" Caitlin Clark replied with two words that immediately resonated. ""I knew.""The reaction traced back to Iowa, where Clark and Garza shared a season together during 2020–21.Clark was a freshman finding her footing. Garza was a senior finishing a dominant college career that ended with national player of the year honors.Garza’s role in Boston has expanded as the season progressed. Over his first 19 games, he averaged 13.1 minutes and 6.1 points. Since reentering the rotation, his minutes climbed to 21.8 per game. Production followed. He now averages 10.1 points and 5.7 rebounds during that stretch, while posting elite efficiency from beyond the arc. Boston has responded with wins, moving deeper into the East’s upper tier.Garza’s recent performances show why his minutes continue to rise. Against Denver at TD Garden, he emerged as one of Boston’s most reliable pieces despite the loss. In 19 minutes, Garza finished with 11 points and five rebounds. He did not miss a shot. He went 5-for-5 from the field and converted his lone three-point attempt. The Celtics outscored Denver by 11 points while he was on the floor.Boston’s offense stalled late that night, though Jaylen Brown delivered 33 points. The team fell 114-110 and saw a four-game win streak end. Even so, Garza’s presence stood out. His consistency has become a stabilizing element for a roster navigating injuries and shifting roles.The Celtics now sit among the East’s most competitive teams and are looking to dominate the Eastern Conference as well as the league.Also Read: LeBron James can’t hide his surprised reaction after wife Savannah debuts a bold new haircut",Caitlin Clark responded to a story about Luka Garza on Twitter.

Golden State Warriors injury update on Seth Curry’s recovery timeline



Golden State Warriors injury update amid strong team momentum



Seth Curry’s return to the court remains on hold as the Golden State Warriors continue to take a cautious approach with his recovery. The veteran guard is dealing with a sciatic nerve issue that has limited his availability since early December. While recent medical evaluations show progress, the team has made it clear that Curry is not close to a full return and will remain sidelined for at least two more weeks.The Warriors confirmed the update through their latest PR report, revealing that Curry will be re-evaluated after this rehab window. He has been working daily with the training staff, focusing on stabilizing his lower back and pelvis. For Golden State, the priority remains long-term health rather than a rushed comeback during a demanding stretch of the season.Stephen Curry’s brother, Seth Curry’s injury dates back to late December, when discomfort in his lower back and pelvis was diagnosed as sciatica. Since then, he has missed a significant run of games and appeared in only two contests this season. In those limited minutes, he averaged 7.0 points, 2.0 rebounds, and 1.5 assists across 16 minutes per game, offering brief flashes of shooting depth off the bench.ESPN’s Anthony Slater provided further clarity on the medical findings, reporting that Curry ""had an MRI on his lower back/pelvis that confirmed a sciatic nerve issue.He will be re-evaluated in two weeks."" That timeline aligns with the Warriors’ internal plan, which keeps Curry out through at least late January.At 35, Curry’s situation requires careful management. Sciatic nerve issues can linger if aggravated, and Golden State appears determined to avoid setbacks. His absence has not disrupted the rotation, but it does delay a potential reunion storyline that fans were eager to see unfold.Curry’s journey back to Golden State carries personal significance. After being waived before the season, he joined the Warriors in late November on a standard contract, officially reuniting the Curry brothers on the same NBA roster. His professional roots with the franchise go even deeper, dating back to 2013 with the Santa Cruz G League program.While Curry continues rehab, the Warriors have found their footing. They enter Sunday’s home matchup against the Hawks having won seven of their last ten games. Golden State sits at 21-18, ranks tenth in net rating, and continues to lean on elite defense, currently seventh in defensive rating.Offensively, the load belongs to Stephen Curry and Jimmy Butler, who lead the team with 28.7 and 19.6 points per game. Stephen Curry has scored at least 26 points in seven straight starts, anchoring an offense that remains effective even without his brother available.For now, Seth Curry’s focus stays on recovery. The Warriors will reassess in two weeks, hoping progress continues without complication.Also Read: Golden State Warriors vs Atlanta Hawks (01-11-2026) game preview: When and where to watch, expected lineup, injury report, prediction, and more","Seth Curry has been sidelined since December with a sciatic nerve issue.

Phoenix Suns vs Washington Wizards - Game Prediction

The Phoenix Suns defeated the New York Knicks on Friday night, continuing their winning streak at home. As a home favourite going into Sunday's game against the Washington Wizards, Phoenix is an outstanding 13-5 straight up at home and has covered the spread in eight of ten games. All-Star guard Trae Young, who Washington made a big impact by acquiring, will not participate in this game because he is recovering from knee and quad ailments.The Wizards are facing one of the league's top home defences on the road, which puts them in a difficult situation. This season, Booker and the Suns are among the league's top home teams, particularly when they are favoured. With an average scoring margin of +15.3 in those games, Phoenix is 13-5 straight up at home and has gone 8-2 against the spread as a home favourite.

What could decide the game

The Milwaukee Bucks visit Denver on January 11, 2026, to face the Denver Nuggets in a game shaped more by availability than form. Milwaukee comes in healthier and playing better basketball lately. Denver is trying to stay on top of the West while dealing with a long injury list.This matchup at Ball Arena matters for different reasons. The Bucks are trying to build some stability after a slow start to the season. The Nuggets are focused on getting through games without their core intact and avoiding another poor showing like the recent loss to Atlanta.Milwaukee Bucks’ report is short. Taurean Prince is out following neck surgery. Kevin Porter Jr. is listed as probable with a right hip contusion. The biggest update is that Giannis Antetokounmpo is fully available and has been playing without restrictions since returning.Denver Nuggets’ situation is far more complicated. Nikola Jokić will not play due to a knee injury. Jonas Valanciunas is out with a calf issue, Cameron Johnson is sidelined with a knee injury, Tamar Bates is out with a foot injury, and Spencer Jones is questionable with an ankle problem.Jamal Murray is also questionable because of a left ankle injury. Christian Braun and Aaron Gordon are both expected to play but are dealing with ankle and hamstring issues, respectively. Without Jokić, Denver’s frontcourt depth becomes a major concern.Tip-off is set for 8:00 PM ET. The game will air on TNT. Streaming options include NBA League Pass, Fubo, and DirecTV Stream. Radio coverage is available on SiriusXM NBA Radio, with separate channels for Bucks and Nuggets broadcasts. Live stats and updates will be available throughout the game on NBA.com.Milwaukee Bucks enter the game with a 17-21 record. Since Giannis returned, the Bucks have won five of their last seven games, and their offense has been more consistent during that stretch.Denver Nuggets are 25-13 and still leads the Western Conference. However, their numbers drop without Jokić on the floor. He averages 21.2 points, 8.1 rebounds, and 7.7 assists, and his absence affects both ends of the court.Milwaukee will look to attack inside early, especially with Denver missing Jokić. The Bucks have already won tough road games recently, including wins against Philadelphia and Boston. Denver’s chances depend heavily on Jamal Murray’s availability and how well their rotation holds up late in the game. If Murray sits or is limited, Denver may struggle to close, something that has already been an issue in recent losses.","Milwaukee Bucks visit Denver Nuggets on January 11, 2026.

How the Foot Issue Has Played Out

Is Anthony Edwards playing tonight vs the San Antonio Spurs (January 11, 2026)

What Anthony Edwards Status Means for Minnesota Timberwolves

Fantasy and Betting Notes for Minnesota Timberwolves vs San Antonio Spurs (January 11, 2026)

The Minnesota Timberwolves head into their January 11, 2026 game against the San Antonio Spurs with a familiar question hanging over them.due to right foot injury management, the same issue that has followed him for much of the past month.The timing stands out. Edwards played heavy minutes the night before and still dropped 35 points against Cleveland. He has dealt with this foot problem for weeks, but it has not slowed his production when he has been on the floor.Edwards first showed up on the injury report earlier this month with right foot soreness. He missed a few games in December, then returned and immediately took on his usual workload. Since then, his name has appeared repeatedly as questionable.That included games against Miami on January 6 and Cleveland on January 8 and 10. Each time, he played. Each time, he scored more than 33 points. The Timberwolves again listing him as questionable just hours before tip-off against San Antonio has raised attention, especially with this game coming on the second night of a back-to-back.As of the latest update, no final call has been made. The team is expected to decide after pregame warmups around 7 p.m.CT. Given Anthony Edwards’ recent minutes and the ongoing foot management, Minnesota has reason to be cautious, even if past trends suggest he usually plays through these designations.If he does not go, the rotation changes quickly. Mike Conley would take on more responsibility handling the offense, while Bones Hyland and Jaylen Clark would likely see increased minutes.Edwards has been the engine of the Timberwolves this season. He is averaging 25 points, 4.7 rebounds, and 3.3 assists and has helped push the team to a 25–13 record and fourth place in the Western Conference.Without him, more pressure falls on Rudy Gobert and Naz Reid to control the paint and carry the scoring load. On the other side, San Antonio’s Victor Wembanyama could benefit if Minnesota’s perimeter scoring drops.Fantasy managers should keep Edwards active but watch for late updates. If he sits, Conley’s role grows and Reid becomes a strong option for points and rebounds. From a betting angle, Edwards has often played through questionable listings, but managing a foot issue on a back-to-back makes this one less certain. Minnesota is still favored by around 5 to 7 points, though that line could move once his status is confirmed.","Anthony Edwards is listed as questionable for the Minnesota Timberwolves vs the San Antonio Spurs (January 11, 2026) Edwards has been dealing with right foot soreness for weeks.

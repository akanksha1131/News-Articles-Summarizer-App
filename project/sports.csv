WV Raman backs Shubman Gill to fire in England: 'He needs the right support'

Prasidh Krishna Press Conference: On Learning, Experience & the Road Ahead

Former India head coach Ravi Shastri has made a big prediction for India’s new Test captain Shubman Gill . Shastri said it would be a surprise if Gill does not go places in a few years.“I’ll be disappointed if Gill doesn’t go places. Languid, lazy elegance, and he’s got a regal element of being regal out there when he’s batting,” Shastri told Wisden.“If he can learn with exposure and adapt to conditions, I think that’s the one name I can see.“He’s matured a lot. The way he handles the media, the way he talks at press conferences, at tosses—he’s matured a lot.“Let him be there for three years. Don’t chop and change irrespective of what happens in the series. Stick with him for three years, and I think he will deliver for you,” he added.Gill scored a sublime century on his captaincy debut for India in Headingley. Gill joined the elite list of Indians which includes Sunil Gavaskar, Virat Kohli, Vijay Hazare, and Dilip Vengsarkar to score a hundred on Test captaincy debut.Gill is the 23rd player to score a century in a debut innings as captain and the fourth-youngest among them, behind Herbie Taylor, Alastair Cook, and Steven Smith.India’s right-arm seamer Prasidh Krishna has also shared his thoughts on the newly appointed Test skipper, saying the young middle-order batter has created a “very good atmosphere” in the dressing room.“I think he did a pretty good job. All of us saw how he rotated the bowlers, made sure everybody had enough breaks, brought in people at the right times, and saw opportunities to bring in the right kind of bowlers. All of that was great, and knowing him, he set a very good atmosphere around. He’s been speaking to all of us. We always go in with a plan, and the communication is happening there.”",Shubman Gill scored a sublime century on his captaincy debut for India in Headingley.

NEW DELHI: The feeling of lifting the T20 World Cup in 2024 still seems to have not fully sunk in for Rohit Sharma . On June 29 last year, in Barbados, India ended an 11-year-long ICC trophy drought by defeating South Africa by seven runs to win the ICC T20 World Cup title for the second time. It was Rohit Sharma's second ICC T20 World Cup triumph and his first ICC title as captain, coming after the heartbreak of losing the 2023 ICC Cricket World Cup final to Australia at home despite a ten-match winning streak.Exactly a year after that iconic victory, India’s T20 World Cup-winning captain Rohit Sharma took everyone down memory lane, recalling the memorable day.“Thirteen years is a long time. Most people don’t even have a 13-year career. So, to wait that long to win a World Cup… the last one I won was in 2007,"" he said, speaking exclusively on JioHotstar’s special show Champions Waali Feeling Phir Se.""For me, it couldn't have gotten any bigger than this. I didn’t sleep the whole night. I was only thinking about the World Cup. I was nervous. I couldn’t feel my legs. Did I feel nerves? Of course. I just don’t show it—but inside, it was a lot,"" Rohit said.""We were supposed to leave around 8:30 or 9 in the morning. But I woke up at 7. From my room, I could see the ground and just kept watching it. I remember thinking—‘In two hours, I’ll be there. And in four hours, the result will be out.Either the Cup will be here or it won’t.’” he added.The tournament also marked a significant moment for Indian cricket, as it was the farewell of two legends — Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli — from the T20 format. Both walked away from the shortest format with their heads held high.Rohit was a standout performer with the bat for India during the tournament, amassing 257 runs in eight innings, including three half-centuries. He averaged 36.71 and had a strike rate of over 155, finishing as the second-highest run-scorer in the tournament.",Rohit Sharma speaks exclusively on JioHotstar’s Champions Waali Feeling Phir Se.

Brief Scores

Washington Freedom:

San Francisco Unicorns:

The San Francisco Unicorns’ unbeaten streak in MLC 2025 finally came to an end, though they remain at the top of the points table, now holding their position only on the basis of a superior net run rate. Mitchell Owen’s sensational five-wicket haul led Washington Freedom to a 12-run victory in Dallas on Saturday.Unicorns skipper Matthew Short continued his strong form with the bat as his side chased a modest target of 170—a score that looked manageable given recent high-scoring games. Despite little support from Finn Allen and Jake Fraser-McGurk, Unicorns reached 52 for 1 during the powerplay.Short eventually found some backing from Sanjay Krishnamurthi, but after Short fell in the 11th over for a commanding 67—out of the 97 total—the chase quickly unraveled. With only 73 required, the Unicorns’ middle order appeared to be in control.That was when Owen took charge with the ball. He removed Short in his first over and then dismissed Hassan Khan and Romario Shepherd in successive deliveries soon after. Assisted by wickets from Jack Edwards and Ian Holland, the Unicorns collapsed to 113 for 7 by the 16th over.Owen returned in the 19th over to clean up tailenders Haris Rauf and Brody Couch, finishing with remarkable figures of 5 for 17.With 27 needed off the final over, Jahmar Hamilton fought valiantly with an unbeaten 31 from 18 balls, but Saurabh Netravalkar held his nerve, conceding only 14 runs to seal the win.Earlier, after choosing to bat, Freedom were in deep trouble at 13 for 3 inside three overs, courtesy of a fiery opening burst from Xavier Bartlett, who removed Owen (first ball), Rachin Ravindra, and Andries Gous.Glenn Maxwell fell cheaply, but Jack Edwards and Glenn Phillips steadied things with a 71-run stand off 64 balls. Phillips then shifted gears during a 31-run partnership in just 12 deliveries with Obus Pienaar. After Phillips departed for a 39-ball 58, Pienaar finished with an unbeaten 37 off 16 balls alongside Mukhtar Ahmed.Both teams now share six wins in seven matches, though the Unicorns boast a commanding net run rate advantage—2.016 compared to Washington’s 0.603.169/6 in 20 overs (Glenn Phillips 58, Jack Edwards 42, Obus Pienaar 30*; Xavier Bartlett 32/4, Romario Shepherd 28/1)157/9 in 20 overs (Matthew Short 67, Jahmar Hamilton 31*, Sanjay Krishnamurthi 24; Mitchell Owen 17/5, Ian Holland 23/1, Amila Aponso 23/1)","Washington Freedom beat San Francisco Unicorns by 12 runs in Major League Cricket 2025 match.

Partnering with fellow debutant Dewald Brevis, Pretorius stitched together a rapid 95-run stand in just 88 balls. Brevis contributed 51 off 38 balls, including four sixes, registering the fastest Test fifty by a South African debutant.""There were nerves when I walked in,"" Pretorius said after play. ""We knew they had only two seamers, and we targeted the spinners.I just love batting.

Jasprit Bumrah: India’s Spearhead Locked In for 2nd Test?

Kuldeep Yadav spins it tight at Edgbaston

Right from the moment he stepped into the nets area of the Edgbaston Cricket Ground, Jasprit Bumrah meant business. Soon after covering the little walk, he picked up a ball and the trademark shoulder click - right goes up and left goes down as he walks - he was standing on top of his mark in the centre net.Just a few gentle deliveries followed as he began warming up for what was going to be an intense spell of fast bowling. With every delivery, the pace increased and he was loose enough, the measuring tape was out to mark his run-up for a 20-minute burst at full tilt. With Shubman Gill, KL Rahul, Yashasvi Jaiswal and Rishabh Pant taking a break from today's session, Bumrah bowled to the likes of Sai Sudharsan, Ravindra Jadeja and Karun Nair in the nets.He beat the batters with ease, tested them with accuracy and kept them on their toes with different angles - around the wicket for left-handers and using the width of the crease for the right-handers. More than the skills, it was how he looked mentally very fresh and the three-day break from bowling clearly helped the 31-year-old who was bowling with Mohammed Siraj and Prasidh Krishna in tandem.The trio, which featured in the Headingley Test, didn't do any bowling during the team's first practice in Birmingham on Friday but trained with a lot of purpose on the second day.Each of them bowled for around thirty minutes and then later padded up for an extended hit in the nets.Siraj worked on leaves, ducks and forward defence with batting coach Sitanshu Kotak while Bumrah kept shuffling nets for a taste of everything which was on offer. Starting from side-armers to slow bowlers to some throwdowns, Bumrah was very focussed during his long session. There was plenty of shadow practice when he waited for his turn to bat and from the horrible start in the far most net, the right-hander grew in confidence after he played a few deliveries and looked assured before ending the long day.Business as usual continued in the other nets as Ravindra Jadeja continued to bat, Arshdeep Singh and Akash Deep continued to make an impression, and Kuldeep Yadav continued to work on both batting and bowling. While the door for either Akash or Arshdeep depends on Bumrah's availability, Kuldeep is leaving no stone unturned as far as preparation is concerned.The chinaman bowls, bats and takes a lot of feedback from both the support staff and other players in the team. He doesn't shy away from trying new angles or varying lengths and the dry weather in Birmingham could force the Indian team management to look his way for the second Test next week.Physically, he is looking as good as he has in the recent past and the bowling rhythm is very evident from the way he is bowling in the nets right from the pre-match sessions in Leeds before the series opener. He had a very gripping contest with Gill on eve of the first Test and continues to enjoy his battles with India batters in Birmingham.It's not just the bowling he is working on as hours have been spent honing his batting under the watchful eyes of head coach Gautam Gambhir and batting coach Sitanshu Kotak. For the last 18 months, Kuldeep has been making a very serious effort to get his act sorted with the bat and he is desperate to start making meaningful contributions for the side with the bat too.After two days under the sun, the side will now have a break and will regroup on June 30. The bowlers can put their feet up and relax, and bowling coach Morne Morkel can resume his WWE with Arshdeep and Akash Deep in the team hotel. As far as Bumrah is concerned, the suspense will continue, at least for the next 48 hours.","Jasprit Bumrah bowled to the likes of Sai Sudharsan, Ravindra Jadeja and Karun Nair in the nets.

India Add Spin Option Ahead of 2nd Test | All Eyes on Team Balance

Teenage batting sensation Lhuan-dre Pretorious etched his name into South African cricket history on Saturday, becoming the youngest ever South African to score a Test century on debut. The 19-year-old achieved the feat during the first Test against Zimbabwe at Queens Sports Club in Bulawayo, breaking a 61-year-old record held by the legendary Graeme Pollock Coming to the crease with South Africa reeling at 23 for 3, Pretorious displayed nerves of steel and a fearless approach, smashing an unbeaten 128 off just 141 deliveries by the end of the second session. His innings, laced with seven fours and four sixes, came at a brisk strike rate of 90.78 and helped steady a new-look Proteas side in early trouble.The young right-hander surpassed Pollock’s long-standing milestone — set in 1964 when the iconic left-hander scored a century at 19 years and 317 days against Australia in Sydney. Pretorious, at just 19 years and 93 days, has now become the youngest centurion for South Africa in Test cricket.He also stitched together a crucial 95-run partnership for the fifth wicket with fellow debutant Dewald Brevis, who made an explosive 51 off 41 balls, including three fours and four sixes.Pretorious had been knocking on the national door after a stellar domestic season. He scored 436 runs in five matches during the 2024/25 CSA 4-Day Series at an average of 72.66, including three centuries. He had also impressed in the SA20 league earlier this year, scoring 397 runs in 12 matches for the Paarl Royals.At tea, South Africa reached 248 for 6, with Pretorious (128*) and Corbin Bosch (22*) holding the fort.","Lhuan-dre Pretorious becomes youngest ever South African to score a Test century on debut.

Prasidh Krishna Press Conference: On Learning, Experience & the Road Ahead

Poll Do you think Shreyas Iyer deserves a spot in India's Test squad? Yes, based on his recent performances No, there are other deserving players Maybe, it depends on future performances

Former India opener Aakash Chopra has poured cold water on hopes of seeing Shreyas Iyer in India’s Test squad anytime soon, despite the 30-year-old's standout performances in recent months across formats.While Iyer was India's top scorer in their victorious ICC Champions Trophy 2025 campaign and had a stellar run in both the IPL and domestic red-ball season, Chopra believes there is a long queue ahead of him when it comes to Test selection.""Shreyas Iyer won’t get a chance now. Many others haven’t gotten a chance either,"" Chopra said on his YouTube channel. ""If you think about it, Karun Nair has only just gotten his chance. Sarfaraz Khan hasn’t been given a shot. Dhruv Jurel is waiting on the sidelines. If he cannot even get among those who are in the waiting line, then how can he be considered for selection?""Iyer has indeed had a superb run. He scored 480 runs in just seven innings in the 2024–25 Ranji Trophy at an average of 68.57 and a strike rate above 90. He then followed it up with a career-best IPL season, scoring 604 runs in 17 matches and leading Punjab Kings to their first final in nine years.Still, Chopra emphasised that red-ball opportunities will only come with patience. ""I know he had a good first-class season. He had a good IPL, took Punjab Kings to the final, did well in white-ball cricket — but his time will come in Tests.He will have to wait just a little bit.""Meanwhile, Sarfaraz Khan, another contender, continues to impress. After three fifties and a 150 in six Tests, he struck 92 for India A against England Lions and followed it up with a century in the intra-squad match ahead of the England series.","Former India opener Aakash Chopra has poured cold water on hopes of seeing Shreyas Iyer in India’s Test squad anytime soon.

Jasprit Bumrah Breathes Fire in the Nets | IND vs ENG 2nd Test Prep

Poll Do you believe India can come back to win the series? Yes, they have the talent. No, England has the momentum.

‘I’M LEARNING’

PRASIDH ON CAPTAIN GILL

NEW DELHI: India suffered a defeat in the opening Test of the Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy at Headingley, Leeds, giving England a 1-0 lead in the five-match series. With the series heating up, attention has now shifted to the management of pace spearhead Jasprit Bumrah 's workload. Despite the result, India head coach Gautam Gambhir reiterated that Bumrah will only play in three of the five Tests, a decision made before the series started.""Haven’t decided which two matches Bumrah will play, but he will play a total of three. We need to manage his workload. The scoreline doesn’t change that… he will play three Tests only,"" Gambhir had said after the match.In Bumrah’s absence, fellow pacer Prasidh Krishna sees an opportunity.""What a culture we guys have created. We are learning from each other, no matter who's there or who's around. And with Booms (Bumrah) around, he's been talking to all of us throughout, even before coming here. At least for me, I've been part of this team for a few years now, so the conversations are still going on. One thing you cannot get is experience — you have to go through it yourself. And yeah, I think all of us are excited,"" Prasidh told reporters in Birmingham.""If you look at the team, everybody is here. Siraj has played a lot of games, he's going to continue playing, and whoever comes in — or whatever happens later — it's a great experience and an opportunity. That’s the way we look at it,"" he added.England's win was historic — they became the first team in over 60,000 first-class matches to concede five individual centuries and still chase down a 300-plus target. Chasing 371, Duckett (149) and Root (53*) powered England to 373/5. Jamie Smith finished things off with a six. India posted 835 runs in the match with two centuries from Rishabh Pant, but suffered batting collapses — 7 for 41 and 6 for 31 — that proved costly.Prasidh also dismissed any dressing room issues.""The dressing room is still positive, happy, and very, very motivated. Like I said, we came here knowing what this opportunity meant for all of us. And even in the game today, we might have looked quiet at times, but I think we still had a plan,"" he said.""""We wanted to do something, and we went about doing it — we got two wickets in a cluster, twice. So that kept the motivation going. And then, you know, as a bowling unit, when something's happening, we still ended up taking the new ball. They needed about 20 runs, but we held on to the hope that something might happen. So we were still out there believing. We made sure that until the last run was scored, we were still fighting and making them work hard for it,"" he added.While Bumrah took five wickets in the first innings, the support cast — Siraj, Prasidh, and Shardul — struggled. Prasidh was expensive and lacked consistency.He picked up three wickets in the first innings but gave away 128 runs in 20 overs (economy 6.40). In the second innings, he claimed two more but conceded 92 runs in 15 overs (economy 6.10).""Yeah, definitely (on economy over 6). I had a few conversations with some of the guys about how this game went. I definitely want to bring that number down — to the best I can. And I think I’m learning as well. It’s on me — I can’t say anything else. It’s my responsibility to get better, and that’s what I’m trying. That’s what I’m working on. I just want to make sure I put in the right kind of work and come back here with better numbers,"" Prasidh said.""""Every time I come out to bowl, I’m definitely looking to bowl a maiden. I’m not really trying to give away boundaries or anything. The outfield was fast. The lengths and lines I bowled weren’t perfect, to be honest, most of the time. And they took me on — some were edges, and some were bouncers I tried that ended up going for runs. But I think someone in the team had to do it. And if I sit back and only look at my numbers or economy rate and not the wickets — well, it got me a four and a six, and then Jamie Smith got out. So if that’s what it takes to get a wicket, I’m happy to do it. But yes, every time I bowl, I’m looking to keep the economy rate down and build pressure,"" the pacer added.""If I look at the first innings, I was a little shorter than where I wanted to be. Ideally, six to eight meters is what I was aiming for — that's what I would say. In the second innings, it got slightly better because the wicket was a bit slower. I had to pitch a few deliveries slightly behind the ideal spot and then go a bit fuller when trying to get a wicket. So yeah, I definitely didn’t bowl the lengths I wanted to,"" he said.This England series is Gill’s first as India’s Test captain after Rohit Sharma ’s retirement. Prasidh has already played under Gill at Gujarat Titans.""About Shubman — yeah, I think he did a pretty good job. All of us saw how he rotated the bowlers, made sure everyone got enough breaks, and brought bowlers in at the right times. He spotted opportunities and used the right bowlers accordingly. All of that was great. And knowing him, he created a very good atmosphere around the team.""He's been speaking to all of us. We always go in with a plan, and the communication is happening there. As lower-order batsmen, we are definitely working on our game. If you look at our net sessions, we are putting in the work. I think it’s also about putting your mind into it — making sure you trust yourself, trust the skill you have, and stay at the crease a little longer. The runs and numbers will then follow. And we are working towards that,"" Prasidh concluded.","Jasprit Bumrah will only play in three of the five Tests, says Gautam Gambhir. Prasidh Krishna sees an opportunity in his absence. England beat India in the opening Test of the Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122129432,imgsize-42548,width-400,resizemode-4/122129432.jpg"

Team India’s Intense Nets at Edgbaston| Prep for 2nd Test vs England

Poll How confident are you that India can level the series at Edgbaston? Very confident Somewhat confident Not confident

Star pacer Jasprit Bumrah returned to training on Saturday as Team India’s second day of preparations for the Edgbaston Test shifted the spotlight firmly onto bowling. After skipping Friday’s opening session, Bumrah’s presence in the nets drew keen attention, especially with doubts still lingering over his availability for the second Test against England.Trailing 0-1 in the five-match Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy after a five-wicket defeat at Headingley, India hit the ground running on Friday. While the full squad turned up for practice, Bumrah and fellow pacer Prasidh Krishna stayed away from active drills, sparking speculation about their readiness for the Birmingham Test.Saturday, however, offered a much-needed boost to India’s pace arsenal. Bumrah, Prasidh, and Mohammed Siraj all bowled at the nets, with Siraj following up on his batting work from Day 1. Their return to bowling brought renewed intensity to India’s preparations, as the team looks to bounce back in Birmingham.Among the batters, Sai Sudharsan - the debutant from the Headingley Test - was the first to take guard in the nets on Day 2. Notably absent from Saturday’s training were skipper Shubman Gill , vice-captain Rishabh Pant , KL Rahul, and Yashasvi Jaiswal.All four had batted extensively on Friday, with Gill and Pant spending long stints in the nets.While Bumrah’s return is a positive sign, his inclusion in the Edgbaston XI remains uncertain. The 31-year-old bowled 44 taxing overs in the series opener and is slated to feature in only three of the five Tests as part of a workload management strategy. Head coach Gautam Gambhir , after the Headingley loss, reiterated that the decision on Bumrah’s participation will be made on a match-to-match basis, regardless of the series scoreline.With bowling now at the heart of India's practice, the team will hope their spearheads are battle-ready as they eye a series-levelling win at Edgbaston.","Bumrah, Prasidh, and Mohammed Siraj all bowled at the nets, with Siraj following up on his batting work from Day 1.

Auckland City hold their ground in a historic result

Messi and Miami power through to the Round of 16

A 'heated' Club World Cup

Concerns for the upcoming World Cup?

'New' tournament, same old favourites

List of qualified teams for Round of 16

As the 21st edition of the FIFA Club World Cup moves towards the Round of 16, the competition's facelift has provided multiple storylines. From the number of teams participating to a newly designed trophy, more venues and even a referee cam, the competition in the United States has gone closer to its namesake - the quadrennial World Cup.The organisers have called it ""a celebration of hope, excellence and pride, embodying the journey of every club, player and fan united in their passion for the beautiful game."" With several new debutants and the tournament now being a month-long event, the competition has changed in stature.Now, teams from all six confederations - 12 teams from Europe, 6 from South America, 4 from Africa, 4 from Asia, 4 from North, Central America and Caribbean, 1 from Oceania, and 1 team from the host nation complete the 2025 line-up.With the group stage done and dusted and just 16 teams left in the running, it is fair to say that this edition of the Club World Cup has had its fair share of upsets, David vs Goliath matchups and some heated moments, literally and figuratively.Ranked 4,971st in the Opta Power Rankings, Auckland City went in as the lowest ranked side in the Club World Cup. They were grouped alongside Bayern Munich, Benfica and Boca Juniors.To put things into context, Auckland City are made up of amateurs, play in the Northern League in New Zealand, comprising just 12 teams.Auckland suffered a brutal 0-10 loss against Bayern Munich to start with - the biggest defeat in this year's tournament - which was followed by a 0-6 thumping from Benfica.Already eliminated and with nothing to lose, Auckland faced Argentinian giants Boca Juniors in their last game. In what can only be described as a David-Goliath matchup, the underdogs denied Boca a spot in the Round of 16, who were in need of a win to progress. A difference of 4,819 ranking points and Boca's historical success made the 1-1 draw all the more sweet for the amateurs.Grouped alongside giants Porto, Al Ahly and Palmeiras, Lionel Messi's Inter Miami were expected to be swept aside. Instead, the Argentine No 10, supported by Luis Suarez, Jordi Alba and Sergio Busquets, powered through to the Round of 16, after finishing second in Group A.While the Herons could only pick up one win, it was enough to qualify. After a stalemate against Al Ahly in the tournament opener, Miami were up against Portuguese giants Porto. In what seemed like a difficult task for Miami, Messi's timeless brilliance, exemplified by a stunning free kick, earned them a 2-1 win. Miami drew their final game 2-2 against Brazil's Palmeiras, and confirmed their berth in the last 16.Tensions boiled over on the final matchday in Group E, where River Plate needed a win to make it to the last 16. Inter, however, denied them that pleasure. At the full-time whistle, River's Marcos Acuna and Inter's Denzel Dumfries nearly came to blows, needing an entire team and support staff to intervene. The feud, which first began three years ago, saw Argentina's Acuna show Netherlands' Dumfries the 2022 World Cup trophy logo on his shin guard. At the tournament, Argentina had beaten Netherlands in a heated quarter-final which finished on penalties.Heated moments weren't restricted to the players, as heatwaves and extreme temperatures saw teams give their players ice baths and cold towels. Borussia Dortmund went a step further, making their substitutes watch the game against Mamelodi Sundowns from the locker room and not from the bench to protect them from the blistering heat. Their coach likened the playing conditions to that of a 'sauna'. Thunderstorms and lightning also resulted in at least five games being delayed.But it isn't just ice packs, but ICE (US Immigration and Customs Enforcement) who have been a presence at the tournament, making it the first to do so. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) will also be a part of the tournament's setup, with non-citizens needing proof of legal status to attend games.With less than a year to go for the 2026 FIFA World Cup , set to be co-hosted by the United States, Mexico and Canada, its precursor has revealed several issues. From pitch quality, to heat and weather in general, the tournament hasn't been a smooth one to say the least.Real Madrid star Jude Bellingham called out the poor pitch conditions, saying ""The pitches aren’t great here. The pitches aren’t great at all,"" said the 21-year-old after his side's match against Pachuca at the Bank of America Stadium in Charlotte.Besides the underdog stories, major upsets and more teams, the tournament still remains a hunting ground for Europe's best. Giants like Real Madrid and Manchester City still remain favourites to win the prize. Five teams from the eight groups - Seattle Sounders, Urawa Reds, Ulsan, Wydad AC and Pachuca - were eliminated without a single point.Group A: Palmeiras, Inter MiamiGroup B: Paris Saint-Germain, BotafogoGroup C: Bayern Munich, BenficaGroup D: Flamengo, ChelseaGroup E: Inter Milan, MonterreyGroup F: Borussia Dortmund, FluminenseGroup G: Manchester City, JuventusGroup H: Real Madrid, Al Hilal",The 21st edition of the FIFA Club World Cup has come to an end.

David Beckham (Instagram Screengab)

David Beckham is recovering in hospital after undergoing surgery for a long-standing wrist injury, with wife Victoria Beckham offering fans a glimpse into his recovery.On Friday, Victoria took to Instagram Stories to post a photo of the 50-year-old football icon lying in a hospital bed, dressed in a hospital gown with his arm resting in a blue sling.Captioning the photo “Get well soon daddy” with a heart emoji, the former Spice Girl and fashion designer showed support for her husband, who sustained the original injury back in 2003 during an England match.Though no further medical details were shared, the injury appears to be related to the same wrist issue that had lingered since his playing days. Despite the discomfort, Beckham appeared in good spirits, smiling gently for the camera as he recovered post-surgery.Victoria also posted another touching image of David holding a friendship bracelet bearing the message “Get well soon” spelled out in colorful beads -- likely a sweet gesture from one of their four children: Brooklyn, Romeo, Cruz, or Harper.The hospital update comes just weeks after it was announced that Beckham would receive a knighthood from King Charles, officially becoming “Sir David Beckham.” Victoria marked the news with pride on Instagram, writing, “You’ve always been my knight in shining armour, but now it’s official.”The couple recently celebrated Father’s Day as well, with Victoria sharing throwback clips and photos of David with their children, calling him “the best daddy there is.”Married since 1999, David and Victoria Beckham continue to show that family remains at the center of their lives—even during unexpected hospital stays.","David Beckham is recovering in hospital after undergoing surgery for a long- standing wrist injury.

Lazio have recalled Romano Floriani Mussolini to the club following his loan spell at Serie B side Juve Stabia. The 22-year-old right back is the great-grandson of Italian dictator Benito Mussolini and son of Alessandra Mussolini, a former European MP for Silvio Berlusconi's Forza Italia party.Mussolini initially joined Lazio in 2022 but did not make any appearances for the club. He spent the 2023-24 season on loan at Pescara, where he played 32 matches.At Juve Stabia, Mussolini established himself as a regular starter, making 37 appearances across all competitions. He contributed one goal and four assists during his time there. Despite Juve Stabia's interest in signing him permanently, Lazio opted to bring him back.Fascist fan groups have been present across Italian football, with Lazio's hardcore supporters maintaining ties to the extreme right since the 1970s. The club's historic ultras group, the 'Irriducibili', maintained friendly relations with similarly right-wing supporters at Inter and Verona.Verona's fan base has been involved in several controversial incidents.Their supporters have directed racist chants at Mario Balotelli and Franck Kessie, displayed swastikas in the stadium, and once arranged cars at a fan gathering to form a Nazi symbol in 2014.Some 20 years ago, former Verona club president Giambattista Pastorello stated he wouldn't sign a black player due to potential fan reaction.Nine years prior to that statement, Verona fans wearing Ku Klux Klan hoods hung an effigy of black Dutch player Maickel Ferrier from the stands. This incident occurred in protest of his potential signing, which was subsequently cancelled.","Lazio have recalled Romano Floriani Mussolini from Serie B side Juve Stabia.

Poll Do you think Kylian Mbappe's legal complaint against PSG is justified? Yes, absolutely No, it's unnecessary

What India are doing in Birmingham today, practice schedule, plan and more

France captain Kylian Mbappe has filed a legal complaint accusing former club Paris Saint-Germain of ""moral harassment"", according to the Paris prosecutor's office, which confirmed on Thursday that an investigation into the matter has been opened.The 26-year-old, who officially joined Real Madrid this summer after a prolific seven-year spell with PSG, is also in a legal tussle with the French champions over unpaid dues. Mbappe is seeking €55 million ($64.4 million) in unpaid wages and bonuses from the club.Mbappe’s latest grievance stems from how he was treated during the early stages of the 2023–24 season. According to the complaint, the striker was excluded from the first-team setup and made to train separately with players PSG were actively looking to offload — a move he believes was punitive after he declined to extend his contract with the club.The issue echoes broader concerns about contract-related coercion in football, a topic that has previously drawn attention from the French players' union, which lodged a formal complaint in a similar context last year.bappe was also omitted from PSG’s pre-season tour of Asia in 2023 and missed the opening match of the campaign. He was later reinstated to the first team following talks with the club’s hierarchy.The legal action adds another layer of tension to Mbappe’s departure from the French capital, where he scored 256 goals in 308 appearances and won numerous domestic titles. Notably, PSG lifted the UEFA Champions League for the first time in their history just weeks after his exit.The outcome of the investigation could have significant implications for both Mbappe’s claims and the club’s management practices, particularly in how high-profile players are treated during contract disputes.","Kylian Mbappe has filed a legal complaint accusing former club Paris Saint- Germain of ""moral harassment"", according to the Paris prosecutor's office.

Al Nassr has announced a two-year contract extension with Cristiano Ronaldo that will keep him at the Saudi Arabian club until 2027. The announcement came on Thursday after months of uncertainty about his future.The 40-year-old star confirmed his commitment in a video released by the team where he stated: ""Al Nassr forever.""Ronaldo's arrival in 2023 sparked a trend, leading many established players in the latter stages of their careers to move to Saudi Arabia.There was speculation about Ronaldo's future when he posted ""This chapter is over"" after Al Nassr finished third in the Saudi Pro League without winning any trophies.""Ronaldo's presence is a key factor in developing the Saudi league in the last two years and a half. He opens the door for elite and young players to come to Saudi Arabia,"" said a source from the Public Investment Fund (PIF) to AFP.The Saudi PIF, which manages the country's sovereign wealth fund, oversees several Pro League clubs including Al Nassr, Al Hilal, and Al Ahli.The news of Ronaldo's extension follows Brazilian star Neymar's departure from Al Hilal in January.Neymar's brief 18-month stint saw him play only seven matches while earning a reported $104 million annually.Despite being the league's top scorer with 25 goals, Ronaldo has yet to secure any Saudi or continental titles with Al Nassr. The team recently lost in the Asian Champions League semi-finals.The five-time Ballon d'Or winner had previously mentioned the possibility of ending his career with Al Nassr, a team popular among Saudi royals.Saudi Arabia has transformed its football landscape by investing heavily in European talent, beginning with Ronaldo's transfer in late 2022. The country is also set to host the 2034 World Cup.Saudi football enthusiasts have enjoyed watching prestigious players like Ronaldo and Karim Benzema, who collectively hold six Ballons d'Or, during regular league matches.Some observers have drawn parallels between the Saudi Pro League and the Chinese Super League, which previously attracted players with high salaries before facing financial difficulties.The Saudi Pro League's development aligns with the country's broader goals of becoming a tourism and business destination before global oil demand decreases.Ronaldo initially joined Al Nassr two years ago in a deal reportedly worth $250 million, marking a significant shift in his career path to Saudi Arabian football.","Cristiano Ronaldo has signed a two-year contract extension with Al Nassr.

Poll What are your thoughts on Switzerland's recent defeat to Luzern’s Under-15 boys team? It's embarrassing for the national team. It's just a training match, no big deal.

In a surprising turn of events ahead of UEFA Women's Euro 2025, host nation Switzerland suffered a humiliating 7-1 defeat to Luzern’s Under-15 boys team in a behind-closed-doors friendly. The match, which was played in three 30-minute thirds, was meant to be confidential but was leaked via social media by chance.According to Swiss outlet, a Luzern youth player shared clips from the match on TikTok, exposing the near unbelievable scoreline. The footage, which featured Juventus forward Alisha Lehmann and fellow international Alayah Pilgrim, reportedly garnered over 70,000 views before it was deleted. Lehmann is one of the most popular figures in women's football , boasting close to 17 million followers on Instagram.This is not the first time the Swiss women’s team has faced youth opposition during their Euro preparations. At their training camp, they previously lost 2-1 to FC Solothurn’s U-15 side but managed to edge past FC Biel’s U-15s with a 2-1 win.While the result may seem shocking to many, the Swiss Football Association has downplayed the result. Spokesperson Sven Micosse clarified the purpose of these matches, saying, “It’s not uncommon in women’s football to compete against junior teams. The goal is to bring a certain competitive element. The focus during this phase of preparation is on the physical aspect. Regardless of the result, these training matches are very similar to our international matches in terms of intensity and mileage. ”Switzerland, who automatically qualified for Euro 2025 as hosts, will next face Czechia in a formal friendly on Thursday before kicking off their tournament campaign against Norway on July 2.",Switzerland lost 7-1 to Luzern’s Under-15 boys team in a behind-closed-doors friendly.

Watch: Extrication practice in Formula E

Every motorsport involves risk, where a single crash can prove life-threatening. Formula E has maintained a strong safety record over its eleven seasons so far. However, as a precautionary measure, Formula E drivers undergo extrication practice once a year to ensure they are familiar with the emergency protocols in case of an incident. Recently, NEOM McLaren driver Sam Bird participated in one such practice session. A glimpse of the session was shared with fans on social media, offering insight into this important aspect of motorsport safety.The video shows Sam Bird acting as an injured driver while the FIA Formula E safety team carefully lifts him out of the car and places him on a stretcher. The procedure is designed to avoid further injury, particularly to the neck or any broken bones.McLaren FE shared the video on Instagram with the caption: “Earlier today, Sam completed his extrication practice with the @fiaformulae safety team. This is an exercise that happens at each race with a different team each time. This is for both the safety of the drivers and the extrication team should an incident occur where the driver would need assistance exiting the car. Each driver has to do this at least once a year to ensure their own safety.Some fans were momentarily alarmed upon seeing the video. One commented, “Goodness grief — not me watching the first few seconds of this without context.” Another said, “That scared me there for a second.”In general, fans appreciated the behind-the-scenes look at Formula E's extrication protocol. “Never seen the neck wrap/support before, very neat,” wrote one. Another added, “Much love to the safety teams, always prepared and always do an incredible job.” A third said, “Awesome to see, safety above all.” One fan even joked, “An FIA-mandated nap sounds quite nice.”Also Read: Who is Sam Bird’s girlfriend Jess Impiazzi?

Training local marshals at Formula E circuits

Safety and technical knowledge are paramount in Formula E, where the sport involves handling some of the world’s fastest electric cars. Now, the FIA has given fans a behind-the-scenes look at how local marshals in each host country are trained before every Formula E race to ensure that operations run swiftly, efficiently, and to the highest standards.A video shared on the FIA Official Instagram page features Benoit Dupont, Head of Circuit Operations at FIA Formula E, offering a glimpse into the marshal training process at the Jakarta E-Prix.Speaking about the preparation in Jakarta this year, Dupont explains, “Before each Formula E race, we make sure that marshals are trained to the correct level to understand how to efficiently remove and recover a car. It's very important to have precise and fast operations. We've been in Indonesia before, but it was two years ago, so the goal here is to bring everyone back up to speed.”He adds that Formula E cars require a specific method of being lifted, particularly using a strap in a defined way. As a result, every post is trained individually to ensure marshals are fully up to date.Dupont also highlights the crucial role of the clerk of the course, who acts as a bridge between FIA officials and local marshals.He says, “Leaving a legacy is an important part of what the FIA brings to these races. There are international procedures that might not be followed at local races, so we ensure they meet the latest standards. That’s why we conduct training sessions like this,” he says. “The clerk of the course connects with the marshals, all the trackside personnel, and the recovery team. Since they communicate in their local language, the clerk ensures the communication line remains as efficient as possible.”Commenting on the video, one Formula E fan wrote, “Well done on showcasing these wonderful men and women who keep races going and clear up the mess after an OOPS moment from the drivers.”Also Read: Dan Ticktum shares unfiltered pictures and a note after Jakarta win, mentions losing F1 chance: “It wasn’t down to my attitude” The Jakarta E-Prix was a single-header this year, unlike its double-header format in the 2023 season. With just four more races remaining, the 2024–25 Formula E season is nearing its conclusion. Next up is the Berlin double-header on July 11–12, followed by the season finale in London on July 26–27.","FIA gives fans a behind-the-scenes look at how local marshals in each host country are trained before every Formula E race.

Nyck De Vries pens a post after Jakarta race



Nyck De Vries of Mahindra Racing has finally spoken up after his controversial race at the Jakarta E-Prix, where he received a ten-second time penalty for hitting Andretti’s Jake Dennis just moments before the race ended.

Dan Ticktum bares his feelings after maiden Formula E win



Dan Ticktum’s fans hail him for his unfiltered note



Dan Ticktum shared several memorable pictures from race day and the victory celebration after winning his maiden Formula E race in Jakarta. He penned a long note on his breakthrough win and, true to his unapologetic self, the Cupra Kiro driver didn’t mince words while opening his heart to fans on Instagram, along with a bunch of pictures. He reflected on the time when he was taking baby steps in Formula 1 but had to quit the field amid controversies.Dan Ticktum’s note comes just days after his first-ever Formula E win, following his victory at the Jakarta E-Prix and the traditional champagne bath on the podium. Starting from the very beginning, he wrote, “So there it is, first win in @fiaformulae in the books. I am immensely proud of what this great team of people have achieved this year. As some of you know, I was very close to being in F1 several years ago, but due to some political s****, it wasn’t meant to be. (For those too ignorant — no, it wasn’t down to my attitude). I was ready to give up racing, as at the time, my dream — to me at least — was over.”Moving to his switch to Formula E, he added, “However, an opportunity arose to take part in this exciting, relatively new championship, full of the best drivers in the world.@alexhuigusto and @russellohagan were instrumental in giving me this opportunity, and they, along with the rest of the team, have stuck by me during three very tough years being the least funded team on the grid. This year, with our new investment, it has enabled us to embark on an exciting new chapter with @porsche.motorsport and @cupra_official. The support from them has been immense.”He further wrote, “Long story short — I’m glad I didn’t give up and kept trying to pursue big things in motorsport. The @fiaformulae championship, and @jeffformulae in particular, have given me an environment where I can be me (mostly), and I can finally say that this year I’m enjoying my job again. Thank you to everyone who has supported me to this point. I know it’s only one race win, but it conjured up a lot of emotions for me personally, along with my father and family, who sacrificed so much. Plenty more to come, I hope. Onto Berlin!”Posting pictures of himself showing middle fingers to the camera, he added at the end, “P.S. Last 2 slides are for all those who doubted me.”IndyCar racer Louis Foster reacted to his post, saying, “Mega mega mega mate.” There was also a congratulatory message from the FIA Formula E page. Social media star Juca Vipari wrote, “YESSSSS BROTHER! The first of many!!”A fan also told Ticktum in the comments section, “Enjoy 1 million beers.” Another said, “A fight-or-flight mode and you chose the harder option with an EXTREMELY high reward — and it paid off! Congrats Dan! The first of many.” One more added, “So deserved. Thinking from the end of last year to where you and the team are now — seriously amazing work.

Antonio Felix Da Costa continues to hold third place in the 2025 Formula E Driver Standings.

There’s then a glimpse of the garage, which smells like “focused rubber and podium energy.” He even has his own name for media day, which he calls “Smile until your face hurts.”It’s also revealed that Da Costa sits with the engineers to understand the data – and he actually gets it. As he suits up in his race gear, it’s said to be “30 percent style and 70 percent sweat.” The video also offers a close look at his Porsche electric car, which he races in the Formula E Grand Prix this season.His fans loved the fun video and called it “awesome”. One fan wrote, “Cool guy, super driver!” Another reacted, “That's our Antonio!” with fire and heart emojis. A third fan wrote in Portuguese (translated to English), “The purest reality!

Sergio Aguero takes on the race track in a GEN3 Evo



All about GEN3 Evo Sessions

Manchester City star Sergio Aguero is one of the few chosen ones to get a chance to drive a Formula E car on a race track. The footballer had his own GEN3 Evo session, guided by none other than TAG Heuer Porsche driver Pascal Wehrlein. And Aguero nailed it by driving the electric race car like a pro, although he missed his engineer’s message to slow down to cool the tyres.Sergio Aguero got the opportunity to drive the Porsche 99X Electric GEN3 Evo Formula E car during Miami’s Evo Sessions on March 5 and 6. The video from his Evo session is pure entertainment, as he takes lap after lap, clearly enjoying the thrill of driving a race car.Earlier, the official handle of FIA Formula E shared a video from Sergio’s Evo Session on Instagram. It showed how the footballer missed the messages to slow down and continued at high speed despite the need to cool the tyres. He later asked them to raise the volume and eventually slowed down. Pascal Wehrlein was seen doing a great job coaching him over the radio.The 37-year-old told Formulae.com about the opportunity, “This is absolutely crazy: from footballer to racing driver in one of the fastest racing cars in the world.Every child is familiar with Porsche. The brand represents an iconic heritage, particularly in motorsport. I am absolutely delighted and would like to thank everyone involved for this unique opportunity.”Aguero and other participants underwent detailed training, which included simulator sessions, physical conditioning, driver coaching, hardware customization, and engineering briefings. It not only gave them the thrill of driving a race car but also gave viewers insight into the intricate world of Formula E — how a driver is trained and how the car is driven during a race. A complete documentary will be released later this year, showcasing the entire Evo Sessions footage.Sharing his reaction when Formula E CEO Jeff Dodds first presented the idea, he said, “The initial reaction when I presented the concept of ‘Evo Sessions’ to our teams and partners was, ‘This is wild!’ — which is when I immediately knew we had to bring it to life. We wanted to do something that has never been done before in motorsport; something that would give audiences and our fan base a unique perspective into the world of a Formula E driver, through the eyes of some of their favourite online personalities. ”He added, “Formula E is the fastest-growing motorsport in the world, and we have a clear target to hit half a billion fans by 2030. Through collaborating with some of the biggest names in popular culture right now, we’re able to open up Formula E to a whole new fanbase.”Also Read: Pascal Wehrlein on second place in Shanghai: “First time I felt like we were very competitive in the wet” Even the trainers are among the best Formula E drivers in the world.

Edoardo Mortara on being part of Mahindra Racing



Formula E Season 11 has turned out well for most teams, with new podium winners emerging in each round. At the recently held Jakarta E-Prix, it was Mahindra Racing’s Edoardo Mortara who secured his first podium of the season and the team’s second. While he’s happy to have claimed second place in Jakarta, he feels they could have achieved even more. His teammate, Nyck De Vries, was handed a ten-second time penalty for colliding with Jake Dennis as they approached the finish line.Edoardo Mortara joined Mahindra Racing in 2023 and had been chasing a podium finish ever since. Speaking after securing second place at the Jakarta E-Prix, the 38-year-old said, “I’m feeling kind of disappointed for the team because I think that more was possible for us, but actually happy for me. It’s been a long time coming, this podium, and if I look back, there were several occasions where, with a bit more luck, we could have changed it. ”Mortara found his podium opportunity when both his teammate Nyck De Vries and Andretti’s Jake Dennis were removed from contention after their collision. “But nevertheless, super happy with today’s race. I think we managed the strategy pretty well, especially with the first Attack Mode.We got a little bit unlucky with the Safety Car and Full Course Yellow because I think I could have made good use of my Attack Mode and passed Dan [Ticktum]. I was in front of him before the second Attack Mode. Nevertheless, super happy with second place and already looking forward to the next one,” he said.However, Mortara regrets that Jakarta isn't a double-header this year, unlike its last edition in 2023. ""Right from the start of the year, we're showing more and more performance, and this weekend we were really, really good. It's a shame that we only have one race here. I would have hoped to have a second one,"" he told FormulaE.com in an interview.Now running high on confidence, Mortara aims to continue the momentum in the upcoming Berlin double-header. He has achieved multiple podiums in Berlin in previous years, including one win.Reflecting on Mahindra Racing’s significant improvement this season, Mortara said, ""This year has been crucial for us. We brought some big updates in terms of software that helped us close a bit of the gap with the front-runners. I feel that now we have a package that is capable — not always, but on certain race weekends — of challenging at the front, and we probably had the best package in the race. Nevertheless, this result (Jakarta) shows great promise for the final race weekends, especially Berlin, which has always been a good one for me.

But yeah, we’ll take that podium and hopefully carry the momentum into the last four races. ”When asked how he felt after the podium finish, Mueller had told the media, “Very good! We always had the race pace all season long. Qualifying has always been our Achilles’ heel, if you want to call it that.

We were a bit lucky with the strategy, but I also think we executed really well. Whenever we had an opportunity to move forward, we took it, and we had good pace at the end. Very happy with how it all went — obviously super pleased for the whole team and my crew.

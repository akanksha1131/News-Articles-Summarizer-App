Bravo plays down pitch issue Kolkata

NEW DELHI: The absence of any discernible ‘home advantage’ has become a talking point in the early stages of the Indian Premier League IPL ) season. Barely two weeks in, there is growing discontent among franchises over local curators not preparing pitches according to the host team’s strengths.On Tuesday evening, Lucknow Super Giants mentor Zaheer Khan caustically remarked that the pitch at the Ekana Stadium looked as if it had been prepared by a “curator from Punjab”. The pitch offered decent seam movement that made it tough for the LSG top order to get going up. The surface was also not suited to the team’s bowling strengths.“What was a little disappointing for me here, considering it’s a home game, and you know, in IPL you’ve seen how teams have looked at taking a little bit of home advantage, you know,” Zaheer said after his team lost in a one-sided contest against Punjab Kings.“From that point of view, you’ve seen the curator is not really thinking that it’s a home game. I think maybe it looked like, you know, it was (the) Punjab curator out here,” he added.There have also been reports of Kolkata Knight Riders demanding a pitch with more assistance for spinners at the Eden Gardens. TOI understands that the Delhi Capitals management too was not happy with the BCCI curator overseeing preparation in their first two home matches in Vizag.The issue has set BCCI and IPL franchises on a collision course.The Delhi Capitals management was clearly informed by BCCI that the authority to make pitches lay with the designated board curator. BCCI guidelines clearly state that franchises and players must not have any say in the preparation of pitches. BCCI’s clear instruction to curators for the IPL is to prepare pitches that don’t offer excessive seam or spin.Having said that, franchises have often worked in tandem with state associations to create a team best suited to local conditions. In 2019, the pitch in Chennai aided excessive turn, which resulted in BCCI deploying neutral curators at venues. The board may now consider deploying neutral curators if teams demand altering the nature of ‘home’ pitches.“The pitches have been good so far. Hence, they may be asking for pitches that have more help for bowlers. But there needs to be better communication between the franchise and the curators. It can’t happen within a week of the IPL season,” a BCCI source said.Sourav Ganguly, who was director of the Delhi Capitals last year, had made regular visits in the preceding year to understand the nature of pitches and work with DDCA. It resulted in the Kotla pitch producing high scores during the 2023 World Cup and IPL 2024.“As far as Lucknow is considered, the square needs to be relaid to alter the basic nature of the pitch, which is intrinsically slow in nature. According to BCCI guidelines, it needs to have a good grass cover to sustain itself through the tournament. Same goes for all other venues,” the source said.Zaheer, meanwhile, said the team will try to “figure out” the pitch in upcoming games.“That (pitch) is something we’ll figure out. It’s a new set-up for me, but I hope that this is the first and the last game when it comes to that (disappointment with the surface),” Khan said, adding: “That’s the nature of IPL, isn’t it? You will be on the go, you’ll be playing home games, away games. It was the first home game for us for this season, so yes, there were a lot of expectations and hopes. Punjab did outplay us.”LSG’s frontline pacers like Akash Deep and Mayank Yadav are grappling with injuries. Zaheer pointed out that the team only had a set of young players like Digvesh Rathi, Prince Yadav and Shahbaz Ahmed to fall back on.The Ajinkya Rahane-led side has been clamouring for more assistance from the surface and this is a match they would desperately want to win.The wicket here came under the limelight in controversial fashion after the home side suffered a defeat in the opening game, with the curator even having to publicly defend his methods of preparation. However, team mentor Dwayne Bravo downplayed the pitch issue.“I don’t know much about pitches,” he said. “For me, it’s always the team which plays best on the day, wins. Whether the pitch is slow, or turning or not, should not matter. I always tell the players to make the assessment and play according to the conditions.""",Lucknow Super Giants mentor Zaheer Khan says pitch at Ekana Stadium looked as if it had been prepared by a ‘curator from Punjab’ Kolkata Knight Riders demanding a pitch with more assistance for spinners at Eden Gardens.

Poor bowling in Powerplay too

KOLKATA: In a repeat of last year’s Indian Premier League (IPL) title clash, the Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) will lock horns with Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) at the Eden Gardens here on Thursday. But it has been a harsh reality check for both sides after the IPL mega auction as they have failed to replicate last year’s success so far.With two losses each in the first three games, KKR and SRH find themselves languishing at the bottom half of the points table. It’s still early days and there’s no immediate need to press the panic button, but both sides will be desperate to get their campaign back on track sooner than later.For that to happen, both teams need to get their opening acts right.Much of KKR and SRH’s success in the last season can be attributed to their openers. The sides feature prominently among IPL’s all-time highest Powerplay scorers. While SRH occupy the top two slots, putting up 125/0 (vs DC in 2024) and 107/0 (vs LSG in 2024), KKR are third with a score of 105/0 vs RCB in 2017.Gautam Gambhir pushing Sunil Narine up the order put the wind in KKR’s sails after they tried out as many as 14 different opening combinations across the 2022-23 seasons. After last year’s auction, though, KKR got a new opening duo, with Quinton de Kock replacing Phil Salt as Narine’s partner.Although Narine got 44 in the first match and De Kock hit 97 in the team’s winning cause against Rajasthan Royals, KKR have failed to put their rivals under scoreboard pressure, with scores of 60/1, 40/0 and 41/4 in three games -- the season’s lowest first-innings Powerplay scores.Last year the KKR’s opening pair was so dominant and the middle-order so consistent that they didn’t have to rely on finishers in most of their matches. No wonder Knights’ rising star Rinku Singh got to play only 113 balls last season when KKR lost only thrice.SRH began from where they left last year getting 94/1 in the Powerplay against Rajasthan Royals in their opening match at home. But since then, they have been left searching for that impactful start getting 62/2 and 58/4 in the next two games.The Orange Army has also lost regular wickets (seven so far), much like KKR, who had lost five wickets in the first six overs, which halted their progress. Although Travis Head looked dangerous at times, youngster Abhishek Sharma is yet to fire.With big-hitters like Ishan Kishan and Henrick Klaasen to follow, a brisk start can set the tone for SRH batters to take the game away from any opposition.To make matters worse, both the sides have failed to make early inroads while bowling too. They have allowed their oppositions to get off the block fast and thus lost control of proceedings.KKR bowlers have conceded 80, 54 and 65 runs while managing just two wickets in the first six overs, SRH bowlers too have proved expensive -- giving away 77, 77 and 52 runs, claiming four wickets.It’s time to get the right start in both the departments now.",Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) and Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) meet in repeat of last year's title clash. Both sides have failed to replicate last year’s success so far.

IPL 2025 | Kagiso Rabada: 'Even a No. 10 can hit a six... there's no mystery anymore'

NEW DELHI: When Jos Buttler gets going, the opposition is left searching for answers. Scoop, reverse scoop, pull, straight drive, cut, flick—every shot in the book was on display as he dismantled Royal Challengers Bengaluru. Gujarat Titans stormed to an eight-wicket victory, riding on Buttler’s batting masterclass.The Englishman dictated the chase with a blistering 73 off just 39 balls at a strike rate of 187.18. His knock, studded with nine boundaries and three sixes, left the RCB bowlers clueless.After the early dismissal of Shubman Gill, Buttler and Sai Sudharsan stitched a crucial 75-run partnership. Sudharsan contributed a steady 49 off 36 balls, ensuring GT stayed on course. Once Sudharsan fell, Buttler pressed the accelerator, taking GT home with 13 balls to spare and stamping his authority on the chase.Earlier, RCB struggled to find rhythm, posting 169/8 in 20 overs. Their innings never really took off, as GT’s bowlers struck at regular intervals. The early dismissals of Virat Kohli (7) and Devdutt Padikkal (4) put them on the back foot. Phil Salt (14) and Rajat Patidar (12) also failed to capitalize, leaving RCB tottering at 42/4 inside six overs. Liam Livingstone offered some resistance, smashing 54 off 40 balls, including five fours and three sixes. Jitesh Sharma (33 off 21) provided a quick cameo, but GT’s bowlers kept the pressure on. Sai Kishore (2/22) and Mohammed Siraj (3/19) were outstanding, never allowing RCB to settle. Tim David’s brisk 32 off 18 lifted RCB to 169, but it was always going to be a tough total to defend.In response, GT started cautiously, with Gill departing for 14. However, Buttler and Sudharsan took control, finding regular boundaries to keep the chase on track. After Sudharsan’s dismissal, Sherfane Rutherford (30* off 18) joined Buttler, and their unbeaten 63-run stand sealed the win in style.With this victory, GT climbed to fourth place in the points table, while RCB slipped to third, facing another setback in their campaign.",Gujarat Titans beat Royal Challengers Bengaluru by eight wickets.

NEW DELHI: A moment of concern gripped fans during the Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) vs Gujarat Titans (GT) IPL 2025 clash when star batter Virat Kohli injured his finger while fielding at deep mid-wicket.The incident occurred in the 12th over of Gujarat Titans' chase when Sai Sudharsan swept a delivery from Krunal Pandya with brute force.Kohli attempted to stop the ball, but it skidded awkwardly and struck his right hand before rolling to the boundary.As the ball raced away, Kohli immediately dropped to his knees, clutching his injured finger. The stadium fell into momentary silence as RCB’s medical staff rushed onto the field.After a quick on-field assessment, Kohli was able to continue, but he looked uncomfortable, flexing his fingers frequently.While the extent of the knock remains unclear, fans will be hoping it does not affect his performances in the remainder of the tournament.Earlier, RCB had a tough start to their innings after being put in to bat, with Kohli himself falling early for 7 off 6 balls, courtesy of Arshad Khan.Mohammed Siraj (3/19) spearheaded GT’s attack, dismantling RCB’s top order as the home side slumped to 42/4 in 6.2 overs.However, Liam Livingstone (54 off 40), Jitesh Sharma (33 off 21), and Tim David (32 off 18) mounted a spirited comeback, guiding RCB to a competitive 169/8. Livingstone’s late blitz, including three sixes off Rashid Khan in one over, proved crucial in giving RCB a respectable total.With RCB already dealing with an inconsistent season, Kohli’s injury could be a major setback.His form and fitness remain crucial for the team’s success.

New Zealand's 84-run win over Pakistan in the second ODI in Hamilton on Tuesday gave the hosts an unassailable 2-0 lead in the three-match series, thanks to wicketkeeper-batter Mitchell Hay 's unbeaten 99 and a five-wicket haul by pacer Ben Sears .Hay was unlucky to miss a century by just a solitary run, but his 78-ball blitz helped New Zealand put up a challenging 292 for 8 on the board, after which Sears led the bowling charge with a spell of 5 for 59 that saw Pakistan getting bowled out for 208 in 41.2 overs.New Zealand had won the first ODI by 73 runs.Hay's knock rescued the Kiwis from a mid-innings bother, as the wicketkeeper-batter struck 7 fours and as many sixes, having arrived at the crease when New Zealand were at a precarious 132 for 5 in the 27th over.Pakistan's response faltered early when Will O'Rourke had Abdullah Shafique (1) caught at first slip in the third over, followed by Babar Azam (1) being caught at second slip off Jacob Duffy in the subsequent over.In his next over, Duffy claimed Imam-ul-Haq's (3) wicket. Pakistan were 9 for 3 in the sixth over and Sears made it worse for the visitors, dismissing both Salman Agha (9) and Mohammad Rizwan (5) in his first over to make it 32 for 5 in 12 overs.Tayyab Tahir (13) and Faheem Ashraf collaborated for a 33-run sixth-wicket partnership before Tahir was sent back by Nathan Smith.

Nicholls followed in the subsequent over, departing for 22.Bracewell and Abbas managed a modest 30-run partnership spanning 10 overs before Wasim dismissed Bracewell, who was caught behind after scoring 17.Abbas, who was born in Pakistan, formed a steady partnership of 77 runs with Hay, until he departed after scoring 41.Among the Pakistan bowlers, Muqeem delivered the best performance with figures of 2 for 33, while Wasim finished with 2 for 78.",New Zealand beat Pakistan by 84 runs to take 2-0 lead in three-match series.

Poll Who is the key player for Punjab Kings in their recent successes? Yuzvendra Chahal Arshdeep Singh Prabhsimran Singh Shreyas Iyer

IPL 2025 | Kagiso Rabada: 'Even a No. 10 can hit a six... there's no mystery anymore'

NEW DELHI: The Rs 27 crore tag seems to be continuously haunting star wicketkeeper Rishabh Pant . With two defeats in three matches, Lucknow Super Giants are already under fire, and Pant is bearing the brunt. The LSG captain's repeated failures in IPL 2025—both with the bat and in leadership—have become a hot topic.LSG have two points from three games and are sixth in the points table. Pant has scored 0 against Delhi Capitals, 15 against Sunrisers Hyderabad, and 2 against Punjab Kings , and his poor form has put him under immense pressure.Former India spinner Harbhajan Singh has suggested that LSG find a solution as soon as possible to address their Pant conundrum. Harbhajan termed Pant a ""huge shock"" for the LSG side.""Rishabh Pant wasn't able to do much. His bat has been quiet. They will have to do something about him getting out early. He has been a big shock for the team,"" he said on his YouTube channel.Also See: RCB vs GT, IPL 2025 Live Score Barring Nicholas Pooran's 44 and Ayush Badoni 's 41, LSG batters struggled in the match against Punjab Kings.LSG were restricted to 171/7, thanks to Arshdeep Singh's three-wicket burst, and their bowlers failed to stop Punjab Kings batters during the chase. Punjab Kings reached the target with ease in just 16.2 overs.Half-centuries from Shreyas Iyer and Prabhsimran Singh helped Punjab Kings secure their second consecutive victory in the competition.""LSG got stuck. After losing the toss, they didn't score many runs and disappointed themselves. Nicholas Pooran played brilliantly, but he was trapped by Yuzvendra Chahal. So when Pooran got out, LSG's back was pretty much broken. Ayush Badoni and Abdul Samad provided some fireworks towards the end and got them to a total that was worth fighting for, but very tough to defend given just how strong Punjab's batting is,"" added Harbhajan.",Rishabh Pant has scored just two runs in three matches for Lucknow Super Giants.

After a perfect start of 2/2 wins, led from the front by their new captain Shreyas Iyer , there's no doubt now that the Punjab Kings played a masterstroke by acquiring the service of Shreyas at the IPL mega auction last November. The INR 26.75 crore they spent on the batter could well prove to be worth every penny. However, there's still a long way to go, but the team's new coach Ricky Ponting has full faith in Shreyas, who the Australian calls ' Rolls Royce '.Punjab defeated Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) by eight wickets on Monday to build on their 11-run opening win of the season against Gujarat Titans. In both the victories, Shreyas played a key role, scoring 97 not out off 42 balls against Lucknow and a 30-ball 52 not out against Gujarat.After the win on Monday, Ponting praised Shreyas for his consistency, comparing his control and finesse on the crease to the luxury car 'Rolls Royce'.""Skipper (Iyer) did it easy again. Rolls-Royce just stayed in third gear for most of the day. Didn't have to go any harder than that. Just steers the ship home. You haven't got an average yet,"" Ponting said about the Punjab skipper, who is yet to be dismissed.The Australian legend emphasised the importance of sustained dedication from his team members throughout the demanding season that lasts over two months. The final is scheduled for May 25.""Let's not take anything for granted with anything we're doing. Our attitudes have been spot on. We're just starting to scratch the surface. So let's keep working hard together as a family, as one. And we're going to get better every day,"" he added.The Punjab Kings bowlers demonstrated exceptional control from the beginning, which proved instrumental in restricting the hosts. Ponting acknowledged that this disciplined bowling approach was a crucial factor in determining the match's outcome.""Bowling first today, Arshdeep's (Singh) first over goes for three, Lockie (Ferguson) backs it up with an over, goes for four (runs). Two overs in the powerplay 1 for 7. We get through the powerplay, 3 for 35. Four of the overs in power play only went for 13 runs. So in the fifth over, Maxi (Glenn Maxwell) comes on and then on the back of that, Marco (Jansen). So, Marco bowls the sixth over. He absolutely means it. He ended up with the big wicket of David Miller,"" Ponting recalled, praising the team's focus.""The pleasing thing for me about a lot of the things that are happening around the group, it's when guys are coming in and playing their first game or getting their first opportunity; Lockie was the same today,"" Ponting analysed.Punjab's chase was spearheaded by opener Prabhsimran Singh, who deflated the LSG bowlers with a flurry of boundaries and ended up scoring 69 off 34 balls, including 9 fours and 3 sixes. It laid the foundation for Shreyas and Nehal Wadhera (43 not out off 25 balls) to play their natural game and take the team home.""Prabhsimran, I think you have learned a lot about yourself this week as well. I think you've proved to everyone just what a class act you are,"" said Ponting, before switching to praising Wadhera's knock.""We talk about players making an impact, right? You get an opportunity in a T20 game and it's all about making an impact on the game and on the contest when you can. He (Wadhera) only packed one shirt in his bag because he didn't think he was going to be taking much part in the game. He fields the last four overs and then I tap him on the shoulder. When I saw that they'd (LSG) made their impact sub as a left-arm off spinner, I said, 'mate, you're going in'.""","Punjab defeated Lucknow Super Giants by eight wickets on Monday to build on their 11-run opening win of the season against Gujarat Titans. In both the victories, Shreyas played a key role, scoring 97 not out off 42 balls against Lucknow and a 30-ball 52 not out against Gujarat.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-119902223,imgsize-40860,width-400,resizemode-4/119902223.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Jasprit Bumrah ’s return to competitive cricket may take a little longer. It is understood that he is yet to bowl full tilt at the BCCI’s Centre of Excellence (CoE). Pacer Akash Deep’s comeback, too, has been pushed back by at least a week.TOI has learnt that Bumrah is clinically fit, but his workload is being increased gradually since he is at risk of suffering a stress fracture of the back. Even Akash Deep is nursing a back injury. Both pacers have not played any competitive cricket since the tour of Australia. While Bumrah suffered a lower back injury during the middle of the Syndey Test in the first week of January, Akash Deep couldn’t make it to the XI after developing some “discomfort”.The BCCI medical team has decided to tread very cautiously with Bumrah, given India are slated to play five Tests in England immediately after the IPL . As it is, the national selectors and the team management are not banking on Bumrah to play all five Tests.Also See: GT vs RCB Live Score, IPL 2025 “Bumrah’s injury is a bit more serious. The medical team wants to ensure he doesn’t suffer a stress fracture. Bumrah himself is being careful. He is bowling at the CoE but it could take longer to get back in full swing. No definite timeline has been set yet, but one hopes he gets back by mid-April. Akash Deep too hopes to get back by April 10,” a BCCI source said.Bumrah was initially expected to join Mumbai Indians by April 1.Meanwhile, Lucknow Super Giants pacer Mayank Yadav is also on the same timeline as Akash Deep and Bumrah. According to the refreshed standard operating procedure, the bowling coach at the CoE will have to give the final clearance. While the medical team decides if the player if fit enough to endure the rigours of high-performance sport, the bowling coach must decide if he is ready to go once he leaves the CoE.","Jasprit Bumrah is yet to bowl full tilt at the BCCI’s Centre of Excellence.

(The story was updated after an input from sources close to Suryakumar Yadav)

There seems to be a coup underway in Mumbai cricket as hours after Yashasvi Jaiswal sent an email seeking a No Objection Certificate (NOC), another star India batter is learnt to be on his way out too.While no final decision has been taken, there is a possibility of India T20I captain Suryakumar Yadav following his Mumbai teammate to Goa. Sources close to the star batter, however, have denied this move at the moment.The Goa Cricket Association (GCA) is currently reaching out to players across the country after they were promoted to the Elite Group in the Ranji Trophy. While the talks with Jaiswal materialised a few days back, it is also learnt that Hyderabad captain Tilak Varma has also been approached. When contacted, GCA secretary Shambha Desai didn't give any details but said they will be finalising their remaining professional players shortly.""We are currently in talks with many players from the country. I can't give you a name right now. We will be finalising other professional players soon,"" Desai tells TimesofIndia.com.Also See: GT vs RCB Live Score, IPL 2025 Jaiswal has already sought a NOC from the Mumbai Cricket Association (MCA) and Desai reveals they reached out to the youngster over a week back.""We reached out to Jaiswal some 8-10 days back, he got back to us after thinking over it and now that he has asked for a NOC, the formalities and the required paperwork will be completed,"" adds Desai.The move has raised plenty of eyebrows but those tracking developments feel some incidents could have contributed to the move. Jaiswal was sent off the field by Ajinkya Rahane , the current Mumbai red-ball captain, during a 2022 Duleep Trophy fixture between West Zone and South Zone and there have been strong murmurs of unrest in the Mumbai dressing room since that incident.Even in the last domestic season, Jaiswal, who was set to play the Ranji Trophy semi-final vs Vidarbha complained of pain in the ankle and returned home from Nagpur. He had earlier played vs J&K at home when he opened the innings with Rohit Sharma and returned with scores of 4 & 26.It is further understood that Jaiswal did consult with his senior Mumbai teammates before making the move and captaincy ambition could have also played a role in him sending that email on Wednesday. The timing, however, seems a bit off as the Indian Premier League (IPL) is underway and he had a travel day with the Rajasthan Royals (RR) unit who are set to play Punjab Kings (PBKS) in Chandigarh on April 5.The team managing his commitments maintained silence over the development and even his family members are surprised.",Yashasvi Jaiswal sent an email seeking a No Objection Certificate (NOC) The Goa Cricket Association (GCA) is currently reaching out to players across the country after they were promoted to the Elite Group in the Ranji Trophy.

Arsenal lose Gabriel

Nottingham Forest secured a crucial 1-0 victory over Manchester United at the City Ground on Tuesday, strengthening their Champions League hopes, while Arsenal maintained pressure on league leaders Liverpool with a 2-1 win against Fulham, marked by Bukayo Saka's return from injury and goal.Former Manchester United winger Anthony Elanga scored the decisive goal for Forest just five minutes into the match with a remarkable solo effort, running from his own half before beating Andre Onana with a low shot.Third-placed Forest now hold a 10-point advantage over Newcastle in sixth position, with the top five teams likely to qualify for Champions League due to English clubs' strong European performances this season.Forest, two-time European champions, haven't competed in the Champions League since 1980 when they were title holders.Elanga, who left United in 2023, has found success under Nuno Espirito Santo at Forest.""He's a special boy and he gives this team his speed. He does it by himself and we are delighted,"" said Nuno about Elanga's performance.Forest's impressive season continues despite playing 120 minutes plus penalties against Brighton in Saturday's FA Cup quarter-final and missing top scorer Chris Wood through injury.United's manager Ruben Amorim expressed frustration with his team's performance: ""This season is like that. We had a lot of shots on goal, we pushed the opponent to the last third, but in the last third we had a lack of quality.

A 1-4 loss to Argentina, their bete noire, in the World Cup qualifier rang throughout the football cathedrals of the world, with stark images of the Mineirazo blinking on the stream of consciousness and social media.That had happened on the fateful June evening, the agony in Belo Horizonte, where Brazil suffered a humiliating 7-1 defeat to Germany on their own turf in the 2014 World Cup semifinal. Two unsuccessful World Cup campaigns followed, which took a toll on Tite, Ramon Menezes (caretaker), Fernando Diniz (caretaker). Last week, the sword, as expected, fell on Dorival Junior .Amid such changes, Brazil’s tendency to implode occasionally has been the excruciating constant. It is not the first time in the recent past that Brazil conceded four. Swamped with information that’s mostly unnecessary and used to obfuscate thought and reason, the world forgot that under Menezes in a June 2023 friendly, Sadio Mane’s Senegal pumped as many past Ederson, the Man City goalkeeper. Last week, however, the unfortunate gloveman was Bento.With 18 months to go for the World Cup, Brazil’s suffering against an Argentina that was without Lionel Messi, only strengthens the notion that the Canarinhos will qualify for the World Cup 2026, but nothing beyond. Thankfully with six out of 10 ten teams making it out of the South American group in this time’s inflated 48-team competition, Brazil and its fans don’t have to spend sleepless nights.The question that keeps popping up like unwelcome adverts, though, is, what ails Pele ’s team? Well, as the football romantic Simon Kuper says, “Brazil will always be Pele’s team.” For a while, it was also Ronaldo’s team. Post-Ronaldo, the history of Brazil is a history of struggle against Europe, non-transference of knowledge, and a story of brilliant individuals failing to play as a team.Their World Cup campaigns are a repeat-show of slipping on European banana peels. In 2006, it was Zidane’s France. Four years later in South Africa, it was Wesley Sneijder who rose above the yellow shirts. In their own backyard, Belo Horizonte, Brazil scripted their darkest chapter against Germany. Kevin de Bryune’s Belgium undid Neymar-powered Brazilians in Russia. In Qatar, Luka Modric’s Croatia cut short their run even though hardly any non-Croatian remembers Mislav Orsic the provider or Bruno Petkovic, the one who equalized.It marked Brazil’s fifth elimination in the World Cup against European opposition since a 2-0 victory over Germany in the 2002 final. No wonder Vinicius is left crying after the fresh debacle on the banks of River Plate.“Everyone did badly, we played badly, and Argentina played excellent,” Vinicius said, “We must rethink everything we’ve been doing, because the pressure will come, the people want us to win.“The World Cup is a year away and I’ve already played in a World Cup and I don’t want to lose again. I think we must do a lot of different things and take the good things we’re doing in qualifying to build a squad. Everyone knows how difficult it is to play in this kit, but we must keep our heads up. We’re going to qualify for the World Cup and try to do everything for our country,” he would add.Perhaps, the screams are a little too late in coming. Lest we forget, the country’s Olympic team, the stepping stone to the Selecao, failed to qualify for Paris 2024. Those who could recall another friendly against Spain under Dorival, the lingering image was how Lamine Yamal taught the visitors lessons in dribbling, a skill that was once the domain of the men in yellow.The words of Mario Zagallo, a World Cup winner as both a player and coach, turned out to be prophetic. He warned that the sellout of homegrown talent has led to the erosion of Brazil’s football identity. He was speaking right after Mineirazo; even a decade later — till his death this January — he wasn’t proven wrong.Leaving the shores early for Europe, is almost a Brazilian way of life. One can argue with some truth that they don’t make Pele, Garrincha, a Romario or Ronaldo anymore, just as they don’t make Shakespeare anymore.Raphinha is the key to Barcelona’s current degree of hotness. Players with lesser ability have come together to win football’s highest honour with organization, coaching acumen and a slice of luck. Marquinhos, for his life, will not be able to explain how Petkovic’s shot took that deflection to send Alisson the wrong way in Qatar. Neither could Tite.Dorival Junior is the third coach that the CBF has sacked after Tite resigned following the 2022 exit. Often quick changes in coaching staff are held responsible. Mario Zagallo was appointed just three months prior to the 1970 World Cup. And the team that rediscovered the ‘beautiful game” under Tele Santana in 1982, considered to be the best team not to have won the World Cup, had been under his charge for a full two years.In Brazil, it has always been the triumph of the individual over the collective. Unreasonable it may seem, as we are constantly feeding off European models. No one can explain Branco’s goal from a free-kick against Holland in 1994. Or Oliver Kahn’s spilling of Rivaldo’s stinger with Ronaldo sniffing around.In 2002, Brazil’s humungous qualification struggle had been buried into oblivion. Among four automatic slots, Brazil hadslipped in claiming the third! Reading Brazil, we instantly go back some 75 years when the world empathized with the struggle of the underprivileged. The intermediate changes in the society are overlooked as we lament Brazil’s reversals.Samindra Kunti, author of Brazil 1970, says, “The romantic idea of football is dead and we are forever expecting Brazil to rekindle the dream.”Maybe Brazil have wasted three years of preparation time or who knows, someone like Zagallo will appear to inspire and wipe away Vinicius’s tears.Marcela Mora y Araujo, who specialises in South American football, feels that the debacle against Argentina is just a blip and not a crisis.“Brazil’s qualification road has not always been smooth if we go by the history. They always have an ace up their sleeve.”",Brazil lost 1-4 to Argentina in a World Cup qualifier in Rio de Janeiro.

‘One defeat cannot define who Brazil are’

Chennai: With the World Cup little over a year away, Brazil find themselves in a not-so-ideal situation. The five-time champions, often expected to cruise through the qualifiers, are huffing and puffing on their way to the football extravaganza.The South American heavyweights are terribly low on morale after enduring their heaviest defeat in WC qualifying history, a 1-4 drubbing at the hands of bitter rivals and defending champions Argentina recently. Making matters worse, Brazil are without a head coach following the ouster of Dorival Jr and have gone back to square one.World Cup winners Dunga and Gilberto Silva , who know a thing or two about dazzling for Brazil on the global stage, remarked that the national federation should have finalised the manager for the World Cup a long time ago. “We have a lot of good coaches in Brazil, but here is the problem. We have one year to go for the WC and we are still looking for a coach. Postponing things might be the biggest problem. You start winning the World Cup off the field,” said Dunga, who is in Chennai for the Brazil Legends-India All Stars match and Football Plus summit.The seasoned Carlo Ancelotti, currently under contract at La Liga giants Real Madrid, has been heavily linked with the Brazil top job. “Sometimes, people take decisions based on emotions. This is not the solution. Sometimes, we have to be in this kind of situation, which is very disappointing. We are going to look for a manager one year before the start of the competition. This makes the work of the players even harder (tougher). I hope that whoever they (federation) decide, we start to play well again,” said Gilberto.Brazil have been let down by the indifferent international form of potential game-changers Vinicius Jr and Raphinha, players who have been delivering at club level.On why they are struggling to replicate their club form playing for the country, Gilberto said: “There is a massive difference between club and country. In a club, you are there every day, training with your colleagues and coach. In the national team, you may have the opportunity to spend time with your colleagues and manager about six times a year. It is not enough. In the short time, the players have to do as much as they can to maintain a high level.”The 2002 WC-winning member, who made the defensive midfielder’s position his own, added: “When you are in the national team of any country, there is massive pressure. When you are in Brazil, people do not understand how high the pressure is, how difficult it is to play under pressure. We, as supporters of the Brazil team, put pressure on everyone. We have been there, so we know the difficulties. We have to support them.”Dunga stressed that patience is key when trying to create a world-beating unit, something that Brazil have not managed to construct over the last 20 years. “We have to understand how hard it is to be a champion. We had a very strong group and it takes time to build that. It takes time to build champions and legends,” said Dunga, a 1994 WC winner.“Brazil struggled between 1970 and 1994, they did not win (the WC) for many years. Talent and technique are important, but only those are not enough to become a champion. It is important to have a ‘team’, which understands what discipline and sacrifice are. Sometimes, one shot is all that is there for us to win,” added Dunga, who also served as Brazil chief coach.Gilberto emphasised that the recent thrashing against Argentina cannot be considered the end of the world for Brazil. “It does not matter when we win a couple of games. When we lose one game, it is a big story. While preparing for the 2010 World Cup, we beat Argentina 3-1. From time to time, these kinds of situations happen. One defeat cannot define what we are at the moment. We should have in mind what we are capable of,” said Gilberto.","Brazil are without a head coach following the ouster of Dorival Jr. World Cup winners Dunga and Gilberto Silva say the national federation should have finalised the manager a long time ago.

Barcelona secured a commanding 4-1 victory over Girona at the Olympic Stadium on Sunday, with Robert Lewandowski scoring twice to help his team move three points clear at the top of La Liga. The win came after Real Madrid had temporarily drawn level on points following their victory against Leganes on Saturday.Barcelona extended their unbeaten run to 20 matches this year, with goals coming from a Ladislav Krejci own goal, Lewandowski's double, and Ferran Torres's strike. Girona's Arnaut Danjuma managed to score an equalizer during the match.Lewandowski, who remains three goals ahead in Spain's golden boot race against Real Madrid's Kylian Mbappe, shared his thoughts on the victory: ""We played with patience, we had a plan and if we play with that plan we can always score a lot of goals and win the game.""The 36-year-old Polish striker expressed confidence about his future in the sport: ""I know a lot of people are talking about my age but... I want to play more years at the top level. I feel very good physically, I think looking at the stats there's no difference now to a few years ago.""Girona, currently sitting in 13th place, had previously beaten Barcelona twice last season but failed to replicate that form. Their coach Michel Sanchez acknowledged Barcelona's superiority: ""They were superior. There's a difference between the teams and that's the truth... Barcelona dream of titles every year.""Manager Hansi Flick rotated his squad with an upcoming Copa del Rey semi-final against Atletico Madrid in mind. The first half saw Barcelona dominating possession, with Lamine Yamal and Fermin Lopez providing attacking threats.A controversial moment arose when Barcelona appealed for a penalty after Fermin was brought down by Yaser Asprilla. While VAR showed contact inside the area, the referee ruled that Lopez had fouled Asprilla.Barcelona broke the deadlock before halftime when Yamal's free-kick was deflected into his own net by Krejci. Girona equalized through Danjuma early in the second half, but Lewandowski quickly restored Barcelona's lead with a clever finish.The Polish striker added his second goal after being set up by substitute Frenkie de Jong. Torres completed the scoring, while Yamal hit the crossbar in the closing stages.This performance marked the 20th time this season that Flick's team has scored four or more goals in 45 games, as they pursue a potential treble.Flick expressed his satisfaction with the team's attacking mentality: ""This is what I love about my team, they always want to score goals, it's always like that. This is the mentality and the attitude of the team and it's good, I think everyone loves it, you love it, the fans love it, the club loves it, and everyone is happy at the moment.""In other La Liga matches, Athletic Bilbao drew 0-0 with Osasuna at home, while Villarreal defeated Getafe 2-1 to close the gap on fourth place to six points.Real Betis continued their impressive form with a sixth consecutive victory, beating local rivals Sevilla 2-1 in a derby match.Valencia moved to 15th place after securing a 1-0 victory over Mallorca, putting them four points clear of the relegation zone.",Barcelona defeated Girona 4-1 at the Olympic Stadium on Sunday.

Sels heroics

Brighton, Mar 30, 2025 -Nottingham Forest reached the FA Cup semi-finals for the first time in 34 years as Belgian goalkeeper Matz Sels starred in a 4-3 penalty shoot-out win over Brighton on Saturday.After the quarter-final clash at the Amex Stadium finished 0-0 following extra-time, Sels took centre-stage to send Forest to Wembley.Sels saved spot-kicks from Jack Hinshelwood and Diego Gomez and, although Forest's Neco Williams blazed over, Ryan Yates held his nerve to stroke home the winner.Forest also needed shoot-outs to get past third-tier Exeter and top-flight strugglers Ipswich in the fourth and fifth rounds respectively this season.Nuno Espirito Santo 's side are enjoying a remarkable season that could culminate in Champions League qualification and a first FA Cup final appearance since 1991.""It was such a stressful moment. Matz saved us again. He's been doing really well. It's the third time and we've always been successful. Credit to him,"" Nuno said.""We are so happy. It's a huge moment for all of us to share with our fans.""We have to focus on the Premier League but it's going to be a beautiful moment for all of us on our journey.""Forest, who last won the FA Cup in 1959, have climbed to third in the Premier League, leaving them within touching distance of appearing in the Champions League for the first time since 1980-81.They are five points clear of fourth-placed Chelsea and six ahead of fifth-placed Manchester City with nine games to go.Brian Clough's men were the last Forest team to make the FA Cup semi-finals, beating West Ham before losing the final to Tottenham.Forest join Crystal Palace in the last four after the Eagles won 3-0 at Fulham in Saturday's other quarter-final.On Sunday, Manchester City travel to Bournemouth and Aston Villa visit Championship side Preston, the last club from outside the top tier in this season's tournament.Forest crushed Brighton 7-0 at the City Ground in Premier League in February, a result that ranked as the Seagulls' heaviest defeat for 67 years.Since that humbling loss, Brighton had won four times in a five-game unbeaten run in the league, but they were unable to stop Forest's penalty mastery.Nuno surprisingly dropped wingers Callum Hudson-Odoi and Anthony Elanga to the bench in a move that appeared to prioritise Tuesday's league clash with Manchester United.Forest were also without Chris Wood after their leading scorer suffered a hip injury on international duty with New Zealand.Wood's replacement Taiwo Awoniyi went close to an early opener, accelerating on to Ola Aina's pass for a stinging strike that Bart Verbruggen saved at his near post.But, shorn of their best attacking options, Forest struggled to make headway after that.Brighton were hardly much more incisive, with Pervis Estupinan's long-range blast pushed away by Sels.Carlos Baleba was inches away from putting the Seagulls ahead on the stroke of half-time, lashing just wide from the edge of the area.After their tepid start, Forest finally showed signs of life when Morgan Gibbs-White's strike from distance forced a superb save from Verbruggen.But Nuno had seen enough and sent on Hudson-Odoi and Elanga.Verbruggen repelled Elanga's close-range effort to force the tie into extra-time.Gomez nearly won it for Brighton in the closing stages, but his header from Brajan Gruda's cross was brilliantly saved by Sels, foreshadowing the keeper's heroics in the shoot-out.smg/dj",Nottingham Forest reach the FA Cup semi-finals for the first time in 34 years.

Instead, he delivered a near-flawless performance, using his powerful serve and aggressive baseline game to become the first Czech player sinceTomas Berdych in 2005 to win an ATP Masters 1000 event.Djokovic, appearing troubled by an issue under his right eye, frequently applied eye drops and consulted his team.Still, Mensik capitalised, racing to a 3-0 lead in the first set before Djokovic clawed back.

World number one Aryna Sabalenka secured her first Miami Open title by defeating American Jessica Pegula 7-5 6-2 in the WTA 1000 event final at Hard Rock Stadium on Saturday. This victory marks Sabalenka's second title of 2025, following her Brisbane triumph in January, and her eighth WTA 1000 title overall.Sabalenka, who had recently lost the Indian Wells final to Russian teenager Mirra Andreeva, showed determination not to repeat that outcome in Miami.""I'm super happy to have this trophy, I was able to play my best tennis in the final,"" said Sabalenka, acknowledging Pegula's performance and referencing their previous encounter at the US Open final.The first set was marked by service struggles, featuring seven breaks of serve. Pegula challenged Sabalenka by drawing her to the net, but the momentum shifted when Pegula served at 6-5 down.Sabalenka secured the first set with a combination of a delicate forehand drop and a down-the-line winner.Despite losing her first service game in the second set, Sabalenka quickly regained control. She broke twice to establish a 3-1 lead and maintained her dominance to complete the victory in one hour and 27 minutes.""I think I was able to completely forget about (it being) the final, about the outside things and I was just so focused on the game,"" Sabalenka reflected.The Belarusian has won 12 of her last 14 matches against top 10 players, attributing her success to her performance in crucial moments.""It is all about those key moments of the match, about playing aggressive and staying with the game plan, going for shots without being afraid of losing the point,"" she explained.This marked Pegula's third loss to Sabalenka in a final. The American acknowledged Sabalenka's superiority on hard courts.""I consider myself one of the world's best hard-court players, but she's probably the best,"" Pegula stated after the match.""She just keeps ... raising her level in key moments of the match when she needs to, and I feel like that was the big difference today and the last few times I have played her,"" Pegula added.Despite the loss, Pegula expressed satisfaction with her tournament performance: ""Happy to be in another big 1000 final and having consistent results and keep going deep in tournaments. The reason we play is to put ourselves in good chances to win these events. I was able to do that the last couple weeks.""At 26, Sabalenka has accumulated 19 WTA Tour titles, with 17 on hard courts, including three Grand Slam singles titles - the 2023 Australian Open, 2024 Australian Open, and 2024 US Open.Sabalenka's on-court demeanour has evolved from her earlier years, showing more composure during challenging moments.""I think before, every time I would lose my serve, one game, I could just completely lose the match because I would still be thinking about that first game,"" she reflected.Sabalenka credited her past serving challenges for developing a stronger overall game and mental approach.""When I was struggling with my serve I had to push myself on the return and had to play with something else. So now, every time I am losing (serve) I know that I have weapons, that I can return well and that I can break back,"" she said.""I think that challenge really helped me to be more focused and not get too crazy on court after losing a game on my serve,"" she added.The Miami Open men's final is scheduled for Sunday, featuring Novak Djokovic against Czech teenager Jakub Mensik, with Djokovic pursuing his 100th professional title.","Aryna Sabalenka beats Jessica Pegula 7-5 6-2 in the final of the Miami Open.

Football superstar and Argentina's World Cup-winning captain Lionel Messi was in attendance at the Hard Rock Stadium on Friday, where Novak Djokovic advanced to the Miami Open final with a commanding victory over 14th-seeded Grigor DimitrovIn pursuit of his 100th singles title, and seventh in Miami, Djokovic won 6-2, 6-3 and will face upstart Jakub Mensik, who upset Taylor Fritz 7-6 (7-4), 4-6, 7-6 (7-4) in the other semfinial, for the title.During his post-match court interview, Djokovic recognised that Messi, who currently represents Inter Miami in Major League Soccer, was present, referring to him as ""King Leo.""Djokovic revealed that Messi, accompanied by his wife and children, visited the locker room where they exchanged presents. While Djokovic had previously attended Messi's matches, this marked the first occasion where the football star watched him play.""Obviously, it's a thrill to have his whole family,'' Djokovic said. ""It's a huge honour. He's such a great athlete, not just a football player. His impact on the world of sports in the last 20 years has been immense.""To have him watch me live brings me great joy and excitement and also a little pressure. It's definitely different when he brings his family. I was touched by that.""The 37-year-old Djokovic's performance hasn't been up to his lofty standards, beginning with a withdrawal due to injury at the Australian Open in January. At Indian Wells earlier this month, he suffered a first-round defeat against Botic van de Zandschulp.During the third game, play was halted when security personnel escorted a disruptive spectator from the venue. The chair umpire descended from his position and approached the stands while summoning security staff.Dimitrov engaged in a verbal exchange with the spectator and proceeded to direct the umpire's attention to the location of the troublesome fan at the sideline.""It's just heckling, it's fine,'' Dimitrov said. ""I'm a very calm guy overall. I don't pick any fights but don't trigger me.''Despite Dimitrov securing an early break against Djokovic in the opening game, the Serbian regained composure and secured the first set in 32 minutes.The current men's record holder of 24 Grand Slam titles displayed remarkable serving efficiency, landing 87% of first serves with merely six misses throughout the match. He maintained exceptional control, recording only five unforced errors during the 70-minute contest.""Now I know how it feels to be (John) Isner and (Reilly) Opelka,'' Djokovic said of two serving behemoths. ""Maybe my serve has been a bit underrated.""Djokovic extended his dominant head-to-head record against Dimitrov to 13-1. The Bulgarian player showcased his finest performance during the match.""He wears confidence like a stain on your shirt,'' Dimitrov said. ""It's beautiful to see.

Fritz subsequently lost the next two points, sending a forehand long after a 20-shot exchange and netting a forehand on match point.Prior to the match, Mensik had a handshake with Messi. ""I didn't wash my hands before I stepped on the court,"" Mensik said.Tennis inspiration came to Mensik through Djokovic, whom he faced in a three-set match at the Shanghai Masters last October.

Teenage tennis sensation Alexandra Eala maintained remarkable composure after delivering one of the WTA season's biggest upsets. The Filipina displayed minimal emotion after breaking world number two Iga Swiatek 's serve for the eighth time to advance to the Miami Open semi-finals.Despite her face momentarily quivering on the verge of tears following her victory, Eala remained composed. She celebrated modestly and proceeded with her post-match responsibilities with professional poise.""I think I was so in the moment, and I made it a point to be in the moment every point that it's hard to realise what just happened. It's hard to realise that you won the match,"" she explained, when asked about her immediate emotions to beating the five-time grand slam winner.""I really tried to soak it all in, because this has never happened to me before, and that's why I was looking at the screen. You know, I really wanted to keep that moment in my mind.""Eala exhibited remarkable poise in the biggest match of her WTA Tour career, showcasing excellent preparation despite her limited experience.""I don't have a lot of experience on the WTA Tour, that's for sure, but I do have experience with compartmentalising. I have experience with being professional.""""I have no hesitation to bring that part of me out when I'm on court and when I'm in a setting that calls for professionalism.""Eala's professional journey began at age 13 when she left the Philippines to join Rafael Nadal's academy in Mallorca. She has spent six years immersed in tennis, training alongside top coaches and aspiring tour players.Her disciplined approach stems more from family influence than her academy training.""It's not something I learned in the academy. It's something I've gotten from, I guess, from my experience as the things I have been through leading up to this moment. It's also something my family has guided me through, it's part of my family's values.""""They are successful people in business, they are successful in their own fields and people I look up to. I think they lead by example when it comes to that.""The match drew special supporters to her box. Her parents traveled from the Philippines, accompanied by an uncle and cousin from Seattle. Toni Nadal , Rafael's uncle and former coach, represented the academy.""So a lot of extra motivation for my match today. I really wanted to have my family see me winning, but I know they'd be happy just to see me compete in this setting.""""And Toni also came in to Miami. That did mean a lot, because I have been working closely with him for so long, alongside my main coaches from the academy, it showed a lot about the confidence and the pride the academy has in me.""Eala recalled a previous photograph with Swiatek at an academy graduation event two years ago. She expressed hope that her victory would inspire young people in the Philippines to pursue tennis.The 19-year-old from Quezon City joins a list of teenagers who have made dramatic entrances into WTA elite competition.

Miami Gardens: Alexandra Eala , a 19-year-old wildcard from the Philippines, produced a huge upset at the Miami Open on Wednesday, defeating world number two Iga Swiatek 6-2 7-5 to reach the semi-finals.Ranked 140th in the world, Eala, the first woman from her country to reach the last eight of a WTA 1000 tournament, took advantage of a unusually poor display from Swiatek, keeping her focus as she fought back from 4-2 down in the second set.Eala broke the Pole for the eighth and final time when Swiatek was serving to stay in the match at 6-5 down in the second set and looked stunned as she struggled to contain her emotions.""I'm just in disbelief right now. It's so surreal,"" she said on court.""I'm so happy and so blessed to be able to compete with such a player on this stage,"" said Eala, who has now beaten three grand slam winners on her route to the last four at Miami -- having dealt with Jelena Ostapenko and Madison Keys before upsetting four-time French Open champion Swiatek.""I'm trusting my shots and I have a great team to tell me that I can do it,"" she said.Eala moved to Spain at the age of 13 to join Rafael Nadal's academy in Mallorca and Toni Nadal, the Spaniard's uncle and former coach, was in her box for the match.""It meant a lot that he showed up here.

World number one Aryna Sabalenka fought back in the second set to secure her spot in the semi-finals of the Miami Open , defeating China's Zheng Qinwen 6-2, 7-5 on Tuesday.This win marks Sabalenka’s first appearance in the semi-finals in Miami, where she’ll meet Italy's Jasmine Paolini for a chance to reach the final.It seemed like a straightforward match for the Belarusian against the ninth seed Zheng as she easily took the first set. However, Zheng made adjustments and came out strong in the second set, breaking Sabalenka twice to establish a 4-2 lead.Sabalenka faced significant pressure at 0-40 but, after showing some frustration, rallied to hold serve and tie it at 4-4. She then unleashed a powerful finish, breaking Zheng again to lead 6-5 and serving confidently to clinch the match.""Honestly every match is tough against her, I always have to work really hard to get the win and today was an incredible level from both of us,"" said Sabalenka.""I'm super happy to get this win.

Paolini sinks Osaka

Australia's Alex de Minaur put an end to Brazilian talent Joao Fonseca 's challenge at the Miami Open, outlasting the 18-year-old 5-7, 7-5, 6-3 in an enthralling contest.Attendance on stadium court had been sparse throughout Monday, but the Hard Rock Stadium turned into a mini-Maracana Stadium for Fonseca's match, complete with Brazilian flags and football-style chanting.Fonseca brought his energetic brand of ultra-attacking tennis, but De Minaur was up to the challenge, coping with both the blistering forehands and the partisan crowd.Such was the dominance of Fonseca's raucous support that the referee switched to Portuguese for his appeals for quiet.But de Minaur won six of the final seven games to move into the fourth round, keeping his cool even when the crowd, at times, disrupted his serve preparation.""Mentally I was ready for this match, I knew I was not only going to play an incredible talent like Joao, playing with immense confidence and nothing to lose, but also an incredible crowd that was on his side from the first point until the last,"" de Minaur said.""One of my biggest strengths is my mentality and that is what got me the win today,"" he added.Top seed Alexander Zverev recovered from a slow start to power into the fourth round of the Miami Open with a 7-5, 6-4 win against Australia's Jordan Thompson.The German was 4-1 down in the first set but then went on a roll, winning eight of the next nine games to progress.Zverev lost in the opening round at Indian Wells, but with Carlos Alcaraz already out in Miami he will fancy his chances of adding to his list of seven Masters 1000 titles.Third-seed Taylor Fritz also moved into the fourth round beating Denis Shapovalov of Canada 7-5, 6-3.The American let slip a 5-2 lead in the first set, but regained control with his serve proving too much for Shapovalov.In the women's draw, third-seed Coco Gauff 's bid ended with a 6-4 6-4 loss to Poland's Magda Linette .Top-seeded Aryna Sabalenka eased her way into the last eight with a 6-4, 6-4 win over last year's winner Danielle Collins of the USA.Next, Sabalenka will be up against ninth seeded Olympic gold medallist Zheng Qinwen who reached her second consecutive WTA 1000 quarter-final, with a straight-sets win over Ashlyn Krueger.""I'm super happy to get this win in straight sets and happy with the level I played today,"" said Sabalenka.""She's a tough opponent, and we had a lot of tough and tricky matches in the past. So was very happy to get through this one,"" she added.Italy's Jasmine Paolini enjoyed a 3-6, 6-4, 6-4 comeback win over Naomi Osaka in 2 hours and 15 minutes.Since her comeback from maternity leave 15 months ago, Osaka has been showing some signs of getting back towards her best but Paolini was the first top 10 player Osaka has faced this year.""I don't think that I can say that I've played a lot of matches against top players like this in a while,"" said Osaka.""The way she plays kind of catches me off guard, simply because of her height. I didn't know she could hit like that,"" she added.Emma Raducanu continued her impressive form in Miami, cruising to a 6-1, 6-3 victory in 69 minutes over American Amanda Anisimova, who had eliminated Indian Wells winner Mirra Andreeva on Sunday.It is the first time Raducanu has won four straight WTA Tour main draw matches in a row since her US Open triumph in 2021. She will face American Jessica Pegula next.Raducanu, who has brought in some old faces from the early days of her career for this tournament, said she was benefitting from their presence.""I'm really happy with how things are on and off the court right now and just so happy that's able to transfer on to the match court,"" she said.Alexandra Eala, the 19-year-old from the Philippines who upset Australian Open champion Madison Keys on Sunday, was handed a place in the quarter-finals after her fourth round opponent, Spain's Paula Badosa, pulled out with a lower back injury.In the last eight Eala will face second seed Iga Swiatek who battled past Ukraine's Elina Svitolina 7-6 (7/5) 6-3.","Alex de Minaur beats Joao Fonseca 5-7, 7-5, 6-3 in enthralling contest.

Alexandra Eala , a 19-year-old tennis player from the Philippines, achieved a historic victory at the Miami Open on Sunday by defeating Australian Open champion Madison Keys .This win marked a significant milestone as Eala became the first Filipino woman to defeat a top-10 ranked player since the ranking system's inception 50 years ago.The emotional victory saw Eala celebrating with her team, embracing them while fighting back tears.""It's a big thing to take in, and I feel it's important for me to take it in step by step. I'm so super proud of what I was able to accomplish, but it definitely fuels me more.""""I know and it's in my mind that I have a next match, but I need to stop, and I need to recognise that what I did today was really amazing. I think my reaction on court, you know, sums up pretty much how I feel about it.""At the age of 13, Eala's family made the decision to send her to Rafael Nadal's academy in Mallorca, Spain, recognizing her evident talent.The academy's exceptional coaching and facilities helped shape Eala into the 2022 US Open girls' singles champion and a competitive player on the WTA Tour .""The academy has been my home for the past seven years. Of course, my family should take credit for the foundation that they laid out before they sent me there.""""But of course, the academy was able to build on that foundation in such a way that I'm able to be where I am now. And I think the combination of everything that I've been through since I started tennis is what has led to this moment and what has led to me having all these opportunities.""The decision to move to Europe was made easier as her brother Miko also joined the academy.""It was definitely a big decision for me, for us. As soon as I heard that, I jumped at the opportunity because I knew that I had to get out of the country eventually to improve.""Eala's tennis journey began with her grandfather, a club player who coached her brother and cousins before focusing on her development.""I was kind of the next in line to do that and to spend time with him. It eventually blossomed into the career I have now.""Her victory came shortly after fellow Nadal Academy member Coleman Wong from Hong Kong defeated American 13th seed Ben Shelton in Miami.""I'm super happy for him and to see someone that I've known so long do so well is definitely an inspiration. Not just to me, but I feel in general a lot of people can take inspiration from him.""Despite her success, Eala maintains a humble perspective about being a role model for young players in the Philippines.""The young kids, the youth in the Philippines, they don't need to take inspiration from me. They can take inspiration from anyone they want. You know, they can take inspiration from other things, which is what I did growing up.""","Alexandra Eala became the first Filipino woman to defeat a top-10 ranked player since the ranking system's inception 50 years ago.

CHENNAI: Sankar Muthusamy recorded the biggest win of his nascent career yet, defeating World No. 2 Anders Antonsen of Denmark 18-21, 21-12, 21-5 in the Swiss Open men’s singles pre-quarterfinals in Basel late on Thursday.What surprised many was the way in which the Indian dominated the deciding game. Despite losing the opener, the 21-year-old did not give up and pushed the match to the decider. He was helped by a flurry of unforced errors that Antonsen committed — the Dane hitting the shuttle wide and long on multiple occasions. Sankar made the most of the opportunity and succeeded.The Chennai lad entered the tournament as a qualifier and registered two wins to enter the main draw.“It feels good, and I have been doing well in this tournament. The first game (against Antonsen) lasted for close to 30 minutes and I feel that he became tired after that. I was able to score points from long rallies and capitalised on the situation. I was focusing on one point at a time and did not think much about the result,” Sankar, ranked 64th, told TOI from Basel.“In the deciding game, I was just expecting him to come back at me and was ready to handle the situation. My aim was to move him around the court and make him tired.”Sankar, who was a former junior World No. 1, lacked consistency in the 2024 season due to various reasons. However, he started the 2025 season on a bright note, reaching the quarterfinals of the Thailand Masters. He was later down with fever and could not give his best in the next few tournaments. However, Sankar recovered well ahead of the Swiss Open.The youngster, who is known for his defensive play, has improved his attacking skills and stroke-making.“My strokes have become sharper than usual, and I am able to finish off points from the rear court. My power is gradually increasing, and I am working on it. There is still a long way to go,” he said.Sankar’s long-time coach Aravindan Samiappan said that the win has come at the right time for his ward.“The moment has not sunk in properly. Sankar was an underdog and had nothing to lose. Our plan was to stay neck-to-neck on points and towards the end anything could have happened. But none would have expected such a scoreline in the decider. It was a bit shocking but that happens sometimes,” Aravindan said.The coach feels that opponents can no longer come prepared for Sankar, as he lends unpredictability into his game now.“Sankar can vary the pace of the match whenever required, and this was not the case one and a half years ago. Players could anticipate what he was going to do, as he played at a single pace. Now, you cannot predict him, and that is the major difference in his gameplay,” pointed out the coach.","Sankar Muthusamy defeated World No. 2 Anders Antonsen of Denmark 18-21, 21-12,. 21-5 in the Swiss Open men’s singles pre-quarterfinals in Basel late on Thursday.

"A new era dawns at Roland Garros: No Rafael Nadal, slumping Iga Swiatek and no obvious favourites",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/top-stories/a-new-era-dawns-at-roland-garros-no-rafael-nadal-slumping-iga-swiatek-and-no-obvious-favourites/articleshow/121386029.cms,"Carlos Alcaraz (L) and Coco Gauff (R) are two of the contenders to lift the French Open title.

For many years, the French Open had a predictability attached to it. For better or for worse, Rafael Nadal in the men’s field and Iga Swiatek in the women’s field were the safe bets. Both had stellar records to justify that billing. Nadal won 14 titles at Roland Garros (2005-2008; 2010-2014; 2017-2020; 2022) while Swiatek triumphed four years in a row (2020, 2022, 2023 and 2024). The Spaniard has dominated the red clay more than any one in the history of the sport and a 112-4 record is a clear indication of it. Still not convinced? The 14 times he reached the final, he won them all.Swiatek’s reign in women's singles has been for a shorter time period and yet has been equally impressive with four titles in five years, including the last three. Among the active players, she has the best win percentage at Roland Garros (35-2; 94.6%) and she triumphed in 2020 without dropping a set.Now, as the French Open begins on Sunday, May 25, there are no crystal clear favourites as before. 38-year-old Nadal has retired and will be on Philippe Chatrier Court only for a farewell ceremony on Sunday. He bowed out last year with his injury-hampered body not co-operating to the grind of the sport anymore. His final French Open appearance was a defeat to Alexander Zverev and Roland Garros adieu came a few weeks later at the Paris Olympics, losing to Novak Djokovic in singles, followed by doubles alongside Carlos Alcaraz.“There’s ... 20 different people that you wouldn’t be surprised if they end up winning the tournament,” said USA’s Madison Keys, whose first major trophy came at the Australian Open in January. “Part of it is because we’ve kind of lost some of our legends, obviously. Like, there’s no longer Serena Williams in every draw, where you just assume she’s going to win.""Poland’s Swiatek took over that mantle from Serena, at least in Paris, for the past five years. That cannot be said this time around.Ever since clinching the title last year, she’s not reached a final let alone win a tournament. The fifth seed has had a less than flattering clay court swing in preparation. She lost in the quarterfinals of Stuttgart, was hammered with a double breadstick by Coco Gauff in Madrid and an equally dismal show against Danielle Collins in Rome.Off the court, Swiatek has had an equally trying time. In a doping case, Swiatek was essentially cleared but did serve an oddly timed suspension.That brings us to the ‘D’ word which has gripped the sport more than on-court tennis. Swiatek now down to World No. 5 - trailing Aryna Sabalenka, Gauff, Jessica Pegula and Jasmine Paolini - and men’s World No. 1 Jannik Sinner have both been punished in different and equally peculiar ways. The Italian served a three-month ban earlier this year despite being cleared of wrongdoing by the sport’s governing body.After winning the Australian Open, Sinner reached a deal with the World Anti-Doping Agency, which appealed against the 23-year-old’s exoneration. It meant he won his third major title in Melbourne, went into a three-month hiatus, only to return for the Italian Open in Rome where he finished runner-up to Carlos Alcaraz.Alcaraz was asked about the complexity of the doping world, taking Max Purcell’s ban as an example, which he said “sounded like Chinese”. But what doesn’t sound like a foreign language is the desire to win a fifth major and second in a row in Paris. His muscle issues in both legs seemed to have become a thing of the past if the Rome final was any indication. Yet, despite his similarities and wish to pick up the mantle from Nadal, he is not a lock-in like his idol.That brings us to other contenders such as three-time major finalist Alexander Zverev, including making the last-four at Roland Garros in the last four straight editions. The inconsistent German’s best showing in the tune-up events was the title in Munich.Speaking of titles, Novak Djokovic, seeking his 25th major once again, clinched his 100th ATP trophy in Geneva, joining a list that is led by Jimmy Connors and Roger Federer. His first title since winning the gold medal at the Paris Olympics last year only faintly masks his three-match losing streak before it.“Kind of [a] new reality for me, I have to say. You know, trying to win a match or two, not really thinking about getting far in the tournament. It’s a completely different feeling from what I had in 20-plus years of professional tennis, so it’s kind of a challenge for me, mentally, to really face these kinds of sensations on the court, going out early now, regularly,” Djokovic said after an opening exit in Madrid.“But that’s, I guess, the circle of life and the career. Eventually, it was going to happen. ... Grand Slams is where I really want to play the best tennis,” he added. “I’m not sure if I’ll be able to do that in Roland-Garros, but I’ll do my best.”On the women’s side, the field is open amid Swiatek’s unprecedented slump. The variety of tune-up champions tells the story - Jessica Pegula (Charleston), Jelena Ostapenko (Stuttgart), Aryna Sabalenka (Madrid) and Jasmine Paolini (Rome). Paolini became the eighth different player to reach a WTA 1000 final this season before pocketing her biggest career title.Sabalenka briefly dropped off from her best form after a surprise Australian Open final loss to Madison Keys before bouncing back with the Miami and Madrid Open titles.""I got really hungry and angry -- angry in a good way and I think at the end, the Australian Open final pushed me to work even harder,"" she told the WTA.""(It) kind of explained to me that you have to really work hard in finals and you have to earn your victories. It was a good push for me.""Coco Gauff's first final appearances in Madrid and Rome have helped her return to a career-high of World No. 2, giving her the second seeding for Paris. The 21-year-old, a former Roland Garros runner-up, is waiting for her first title since last year's WTA Finals.""Hopefully I can get to the final in Roland Garros and maybe the 'Third time lucky' thing is a real thing,"" Gauff said after losing to Paolini in Rome.There are multiple dark horses on the WTA Tour to clinch their maiden Grand Slam title, none more impressive than Mirra Andreeva.In February, she made history as the youngest-ever WTA 1000 champion in Dubai, then followed it up with an even more remarkable victory at Indian Wells.Now 18, Andreeva is a strong contender in Paris, aspiring to become the youngest Grand Slam singles champion since Maria Sharapova at Wimbledon in 2004. She showcased her credentials on clay by reaching the Roland Garros semi-finals last year and the quarter-finals in Madrid and Rome this season.Another one to be careful of is China’s 22-year-old Zheng Qinwen who will be hoping to replicate the form that took her to Olympic gold at Roland Garros last summer.",Rafael Nadal won 14 titles at Roland Garros between 2005-2008 and 2010-2014. Iga Swiatek won four years in a row at the French Open between 2020 and 2024. Nadal has retired and will be on Philippe Chatrier Court only for a farewell ceremony on Sunday.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121386107,imgsize-45308,width-400,resizemode-4/121386107.jpg"

Shubman Gill story: From a remote village near the border to India’s Test captain

India Test squad for England tour: Shubman Gill to lead, Rishabh Pant his deputy

Delhi Capitals secured a six-wicket victory against Punjab Kings in their final IPL match at Jaipur on Saturday, successfully chasing down a target of 207 runs in 19.3 overs. Young Sameer Rizvi shone with an unbeaten 58 off 25 balls, while Karun Nair, recently recalled to the Indian Test team, contributed 44 runs in the winning effort.Rizvi's maiden half-century included five sixes and three fours, displaying exceptional batting prowess under pressure. Nair's 27-ball innings featured two sixes and five fours, proving crucial in the run chase.The chase began positively with KL Rahul, serving as impact substitute, scoring 35 off 21 balls, and stand-in captain Faf du Plessis contributing 23 off 15 balls. They established a quick 55-run partnership in under six overs.Rahul's innings included impressive shots, notably a cover-point boundary off Azmatullah Omarzai and a straight six against Harpreet Brar. However, he fell to Marco Jansen's slow off-cutter, caught by Shashank Singh.Nair, making his return to the Indian Test squad after eight years, started confidently with a six over fine leg off Jansen. Du Plessis's innings ended with a soft dismissal, caught by Priyansh Arya at backward point.Quiz: Who's that IPL player? In the first innings, Punjab Kings posted 206 for eight, powered by Marcus Stoinis 's unbeaten 44 off 16 balls and Shreyas Iyer 's 53 off 34 deliveries. Stoinis's explosive innings included four sixes and three fours.Delhi Capitals, bowling first, found early success when Mustafizur Rahman dismissed Priyansh Arya for 6. The Bangladesh seamer finished with figures of 3/33.Josh Inglis and Prabhsimran Singh provided early momentum for Punjab Kings before leg-spinner Vipraj Nigam claimed two crucial wickets. Nigam, showing promise for future T20 World Cup consideration, maintained good control throughout his spell.Shreyas Iyer's innings featured aggressive batting, including a six over deep midwicket off Kuldeep Yadav. His stay ended when he hit straight to Mohit Sharma off Kuldeep's bowling.The match saw momentum shifts, with Mukesh Kumar conceding 25 runs in one over. Stoinis capitalized on a dropped catch to score 22 runs off Mohit Sharma's over, helping Punjab Kings post a challenging total.Leg-spinner Praveen Dubey contributed by dismissing Sediqullah Atal for 22 off 16 balls, though he later conceded four consecutive boundaries to Nair as Delhi reached 111 for three in the 11th over.Despite losing Nair at a crucial stage to Brar's bowling, Rizvi's mature batting ensured Delhi Capitals finished their IPL campaign on a winning note. The chase demonstrated Delhi's batting depth and ability to handle pressure situations effectively.The match featured strong performances from both teams' bowlers, with Mustafizur Rahman's strategic angle bowling and Vipraj Nigam's controlled leg-spin standing out. However, the batsmen dominated the contest, with both sides displaying aggressive intent throughout.","Delhi Capitals beat Punjab Kings by six wickets in their final IPL match.

Shubman Gill story: From a remote village near the border to India’s Test captain

India's squad for England Tests:

NEW DELHI: Right-handed batter Shubman Gill has been named India’s 37th Test captain, as chief selector Ajit Agarkar announced the 18-member squad on Saturday for the crucial five-match tour of England, beginning June 20.Wicketkeeper-batter Rishabh Pant has been appointed as the vice-captain.The squad was finalised by the Ajit Agarkar-led selection committee during a meeting held at the BCCI headquarters in Mumbai. BCCI Secretary Devajit Saikia acted as the meeting’s convener. The selection was later revealed at a formal press conference addressed by Agarkar and selector Shiv Sunder Das.Agarkar also clarified that star pacer Jasprit Bumrah is unlikely to feature in all five Tests during the tour. He emphasised that Bumrah’s role as a bowler is more vital to the team than adding captaincy responsibilities to his workload.""Don't think he'll be available for all five Tests. Whether it's four or three, we'll see based on how the series goes and his workload is. Even if he's fit for 3-4 Tests, he'll be an asset for us. Just happy he's part of the squad. He’s more important to us as a player.”“Once you're managing people, there's a lot that takes out of you.We've had a chat with him, he's okay with it. He knows where his body's at. KL not really, he's captained a while back, he's a quality player and hope he has a big series.

Melbourne: Australian Open, MCG, Australian GP and lots more

NEW DELHI: India's Olympic and World Champion javelin thrower Neeraj Chopra delivered a gritty performance in tough weather conditions to secure second place at the Janusz Kusocinski Memorial meet in Poland on Friday. Battling cold and damp surroundings at the Silesian Stadium, Chopra saved his best for last — an 84.14m throw in his sixth and final attempt — to climb from third to second.It was a rare sub-85m outing for Chopra, who has consistently surpassed that benchmark in recent years. This was only the sixth time since his Tokyo Olympics gold in 2021 that Chopra failed to breach 85m in an event. He began with a foul and managed just 81.28m in his second attempt. Despite consulting coach Jan Zelezny mid-competition, Chopra continued to struggle, recording two more fouls and a fifth-round 81.40m before his final effort saved the day.Germany’s Julian Weber, Chopra’s familiar rival and winner in the recent Doha Diamond League, again outperformed the Indian with an 86.12m throw in the second round — the best of the night.Weber went on to produce two more 85m-plus throws (85.03m and 85.11m), emerging as the standout performer.Grenada’s Anderson Peters, a two-time world champion, took third with 83.24m, replicating the top-three order from Doha.All three podium finishers were below their season’s bests, with slippery run-ups and overcast skies affecting rhythm and grip. The meet saw only four throws above 85m — all by Weber.Chopra, who had breached the 90m mark for the first time last month, will now focus on upcoming competitions in Paris (Diamond League, June 20) and Ostrava (Golden Spike, June 24).","India's Olympic and World Champion javelin thrower Neeraj Chopra delivered a gritty performance in tough weather conditions to secure second place at the Janusz Kusocinski Memorial meet in Poland.

IPL Points Table

Punjab Kings arrived at the Sawai Mansingh Stadium in Jaipur on Saturday with a top-two finish in sight. But Delhi Capitals had other ideas, pulling off a thrilling 6-wicket win in a high-scoring contest. The result, however, does little to change the bigger picture, as both teams hold their respective positions in the table.Asked to bat first, Punjab looked set for a mammoth total with Shreyas Iyer anchoring the innings with a fluent 53 off 34 deliveries. Marcus Stoinis turned on the heat at the death with an explosive 44* from just 16 balls, guiding Punjab to a formidable 206/8. Mustafizur Rahman was the standout bowler for Delhi, picking up 3 wickets and applying the brakes at crucial moments.Delhi's chase got off to a solid start with KL Rahul scoring a quickfire 35 off 21 balls and Faf du Plessis adding 23 off 15. Though both openers fell before the halfway mark, DC’s innings stayed on course thanks to Karun Nair’s dependable 44 from 27 balls.But the real hero of the evening was Sameer Rizvi. Calm under pressure and fearless against pace, Rizvi smashed an unbeaten 58 off just 25 balls, including 5 sixes that deflated Punjab's bowling attack.He sealed the win with a maximum in the 19.3 over, sparking celebrations in the Delhi dugout.Quiz: Who's that IPL player? Despite the morale-boosting win, Delhi Capitals remain 5th on the table with 15 points from 14 matches. For Punjab, the loss is a setback. Still placed 2nd with 17 points, and they now risk being overtaken by RCB or Mumbai Indians, depending on upcoming results.IPL Points Table:With this result, the race for the second spot in the playoffs is wide open.

2023: A Dream Debut

Shubman Gill story: From a remote village near the border to India’s Test captain

2024: From Defending Champions to Barely Hanging On

MI New York, one of the six founding franchises in Major League Cricket (MLC), has experienced two drastically different campaigns in the league’s first two seasons.Crowned champions in the inaugural 2023 season, MI New York's dominance, led by star performers Nicholas Pooran and Trent Boult , made them the team to beat.However, the 2024 season proved to be a stark contrast, as the defending champions struggled to find form, barely making the playoffs before exiting in the Eliminator.In 2023, MI New York quickly established themselves as the MLC frontrunners. After a mixed start with two losses in five group matches, they finished in the playoff spots and turned up the heat in the knockouts. They beat Washington Freedom in the Eliminator and Texas Super Kings in the Challenger before outclassing Seattle Orcas in the final to claim the inaugural title.Nicholas Pooran was the standout performer, topping the season’s run charts with 388 runs and earning the MVP award. Tim David contributed 209 runs to add depth to the batting lineup. On the bowling front, Trent Boult was in a league of his own, claiming 22 wickets in just eight matches — double that of the next best.Their comprehensive team effort and individual brilliance ensured MI New York dominated the 2023 awards circuit and lifted the trophy in style.The 2024 season, however, told a very different story. While they began with a solid six-wicket win over Seattle, MI New York failed to maintain momentum. A narrow four-run loss to Washington, a rain-abandoned game against Texas, and a string of defeats — including a 94-run hammering by Washington and a three-run loss to San Francisco — put their playoff hopes in jeopardy.A late win against Los Angeles Knight Riders gave them a lifeline as they scraped into the playoffs in fourth place. However, their campaign ended abruptly with a heavy nine-wicket defeat to Texas Super Kings in the Eliminator.Pooran once again topped the run charts for MI New York, but his output fell to 180 runs. Alarmingly, spinner Rashid Khan was the team’s second-highest run-scorer with 162 runs — a reflection of the batting unit's struggles. Rashid also led the wicket-taking charts with 10 scalps, closely followed by Boult with nine.Two seasons, two completely different stories — MI New York have tasted both the highs of championship glory and the lows of inconsistency.","MI New York have experienced two drastically different campaigns in the league’s first two seasons.

India Test squad for England tour: Shubman Gill to lead, Rishabh Pant his deputy

England secured an innings and 45-run victory over Zimbabwe in their one-off test match at Trent Bridge on Saturday, completing the win within three days despite facing strong resistance from the underdogs. The match served as a preparation for England's upcoming five-test series against India starting June 20.England declared their innings at 565-6, while Zimbabwe was dismissed for 265 and 255 in their two innings respectively. England's first-day performance was particularly dominant, scoring 498-3, their highest ever first-day total in a home test.Zimbabwe faced early setbacks when their seamer Richard Ngarava suffered a back spasm after bowling just nine overs on day one, leaving them a bowler short for the remainder of the match.Brian Bennett's maiden century on Friday provided hope for Zimbabwe, followed by Sean Williams' impressive performance on Saturday that temporarily challenged England's bowling strategy.Williams' promising innings ended at 88 runs from 82 balls following a video review that showed the ball barely touching leg stump while facing off-spinner Shoaib Bashir.Quiz: Who's that IPL player? Zimbabwe's resistance weakened after Williams' departure before lunch.Despite Sikandar Raza's quick-fire 60 off 68 balls, the team lost their final six wickets for 109 runs.Shoaib Bashir emerged as the standout bowler, claiming 6-81 in the innings and achieving his career-best match figures of 9-143. This performance marked his fourth five-wicket haul in test cricket.The match marked Zimbabwe's return to test cricket against England after a 22-year gap. Despite the significant margin of defeat, Zimbabwe's performance showed more resilience than the final scoreline suggested, particularly considering they played most of the match with one bowler short.","England defeated Zimbabwe by an innings and 45 runs in their one-off test match at Trent Bridge on Saturday.

Arshdeep says: ""I have apologised to him so many times. What a big scandal it became.""In 2022, the youngster was subjected to trolling after dropping Pakistan’s Asif Ali in a tense chase in the Asia Cup. He faced a barrage of criticism on social media, with an unidentified user even editing the player’s Wikipedia page to add references to “Khalistan.”Rai recollects the incident and says the youngster remained unfazed by the criticism.""His exact words were, ‘I am laughing at all these tweets and messages.'

India’s full squad:

As India brace for a high stakes five-Test series against England this summer, a deeper look into the newly announced squad reveals an interesting IPL subplot, Gujarat Titans (GT) are the most represented franchise in the team, with five players named in the 18-member squad.GT captain Shubman Gill will now also lead the Indian Test side for the first time in the absence of Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli. He’s joined by franchise mates Sai Sudharsan, Mohammed Siraj, Washington Sundar, and Prasidh Krishna.Delhi Capitals (DC) follow with three players: KL Rahul, Karun Nair, and Kuldeep Yadav. Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) also boast three representatives: Rishabh Pant (vice-captain and wicketkeeper), Shardul Thakur, and Akash Deep.Rajasthan Royals (RR) have two players in Yashasvi Jaiswal and Dhruv Jurel, while Chennai Super Kings (CSK) and Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) feature one each in Ravindra Jadeja and Nitish Kumar Reddy respectively. Mumbai Indians (MI) are represented solely by pace spearhead Jasprit Bumrah, and Punjab Kings (PBKS) by left-arm seamer Arshdeep Singh, who has earned a maiden Test call-up.Notably, Abhimanyu Easwaran is the only player without an IPL affiliation.This breakdown underlines a shift in the team building mindset post the retirements of stalwarts. With Virat Kohli, Rohit Sharma and Ashwin gone, selectors have leaned into domestic and IPL bred talent, many of whom have little long-format international experience but have showcased their skills in white-ball formats.Shubman Gill (Captain, GT), Rishabh Pant (Vice-Captain & Wicketkeeper, LSG), Yashasvi Jaiswal (RR), KL Rahul (DC), Sai Sudharsan (GT), Abhimanyu Easwaran (No IPL), Karun Nair (DC), Nitish Kumar Reddy (SRH), Dhruv Jurel (RR), Ravindra Jadeja (CSK), Washington Sundar (GT), Kuldeep Yadav (DC), Shardul Thakur (LSG), Jasprit Bumrah (MI), Mohammed Siraj (GT), Prasidh Krishna (GT), Akash Deep (LSG), Arshdeep Singh (PBKS).The five-match series begins on June 20 and will be played at Headingley, Edgbaston, Lord’s, Old Trafford and The Oval.","Gujarat Titans (GT) are the most represented franchise in the team, with five players named in the 18-member squad.

Shubman Gill story: From a remote village near the border to India’s Test captain

India’s Test squad for the upcoming five-match series in England has sparked a wave of reactions, the most striking of which came from former cricketer and commentator Sanjay Manjrekar. Taking to social media platform X, Manjrekar described the selection as “strange” but struck a note of optimism, saying, “India go to England with nothing to lose. It’s a team in transition so we can only wish it the very best & yes, be patient when it comes to returns on investment.”The comment encapsulates the mixed feelings surrounding the squad, which marks the beginning of a new era in Indian Test cricket. With stalwarts Virat Kohli , Rohit Sharma, and Ravichandran Ashwin having recently retired from the format, the selectors have opted for a bold overhaul, naming Shubman Gill as captain and Rishabh Pant as his deputy.Chairman of the senior men’s selection committee Ajit Agarkar acknowledged the magnitude of the transition. “When guys like Rohit, Kohli and Ashwin retire, it always leaves big holes. But this is also a big opportunity for the next generation,” Agarkar said at the BCCI HQ press conference.The squad features a mix of youth and experience, with some selections surprising observers. Karun Nair makes a comeback after seven years, edging out Sarfaraz Khan despite the latter’s hundred on debut earlier this year.Sai Sudharsan, known for his IPL exploits, has also been included, though Agarkar insisted his selection was based on temperament and red-ball potential rather than T20 form.Quiz: Who's that IPL player? One of the key concerns is Jasprit Bumrah’s fitness. Agarkar clarified that the pace spearhead is unlikely to feature in all five Tests. “If he is available for 3-4 Tests, he is going to win us games. But we’ll manage his workload,” he said.With Mohammed Shami not fully fit, Arshdeep Singh has been given his maiden Test call-up, while Akash Deep and Prasidh Krishna also form part of the fast bowling arsenal. The selectors have also shown faith in all-rounders Shardul Thakur and Nitish Reddy, hoping their dual skills can provide crucial balance.India’s squad for the England Test series:Shubman Gill (Captain), Rishabh Pant (Vice-Captain & Wicketkeeper), Yashasvi Jaiswal, KL Rahul, Sai Sudharsan, Abhimanyu Easwaran, Karun Nair, Nitish Kumar Reddy, Dhruv Jurel, Ravindra Jadeja, Washington Sundar, Kuldeep Yadav, Shardul Thakur, Jasprit Bumrah, Mohammed Siraj, Prasidh Krishna, Akash Deep, Arshdeep Singh.","India have named their Test squad for the upcoming five-match series in England.

Sebastian Berhalter emerges as USMNT Gold Cup contender after stellar season with Vancouver Whitecaps



Sebastian Berhalter's ascension with Vancouver Whitecaps FC has put him squarely in the United States Men's National Team discussion, a season highlighted by guiding his team to the CONCACAF Champions Cup championship game and gaining a strong argument for a 2025 Gold Cup invitation. His showings in both Major League Soccer and the CONCACAF Champions Cup are making it difficult to forget him.“It’s probably the proudest moment of my life.

Even after setbacks such as a fractured foot that prevented him from playing during a championship campaign, his return was one of steady improvement.

Besides his Champions Cup efforts, Berhalter has scored an additional goal and three assists in 13 games for the MLS. His highlight — a breathtaking spinning backheel volley against Pumas — was shortlisted for goal of the tournament. That flair, matched with defensive ruggedness and smart positioning, secured him Best XI status in the quarterfinal and semifinal rounds.Standing five-foot-nine, Berhalter plays with the urgency and expectation of a much larger presence.

Is Yassine Chueko having a U.S. Navy background?

Chueko’s dedication to his job

Lionel Messi is one of the most popular footballers in the world at the moment. Off the field, he has a bodyguard, Yassine Chueko, who looks after him 24/7, making sure he is safe and protected from his supporters.The amazing gross physical condition and martial arts skills of Yassine Chueko make him famous. He is, however, well-versed in mixed martial arts (MMA) and has participated in some fights. He also excels in boxing and taekwondo. If anyone is maintaining high levels of fitness, it is Chueko, who regularly posts video snippets of his grueling workout routines on social media.Yassine is known to have served in the U.S. Navy with postings to Iraq and Afghanistan. However, these claims have been dismissed. Some sources claim that there is a lack of official evidence to support his claim of being in the military. Nonetheless, Chueko's martial arts skills are well-documented.Chueko's primary responsibility is to protect Lionel Messi throughout matches, training sessions, and public appearances. It is generally possible to find him nearby on the sidelines of matches, ready to intervene in case any overly rowdy fans attempt to access the football star.His quick response and vigilance have been witnessed time and again, where he intercepted pitch invaders promptly.Chueko's responsibilities are not only limited to the football grounds but also include overseeing the security of Messi's family. This includes his wife, Antonela Roccuzzo, and their children, ensuring their safety during public outings in Miami. Chueko attracted widespread public interest after a video of him shielding Messi went viral, with the public applauding his commitment and efficiency.There have been instances, though, when fans found ways to circumvent security protocols. In one high-profile instance during an exhibition game, a fan dodged Chueko and hugged Messi briefly before being removed.In March 2025, Chueko was in the news after he issued a challenge to internet celebrity and boxer Logan Paul to fight. The challenge came in the wake of a legal battle between Messi's energy drink company, Mas+, and Paul's company, PRIME.

Vancouver Whitecaps tested by Real Salt Lake as international absences loom



Vancouver Whitecaps FC vs. Real Salt Lake | Full Match Highlights

Vancouver Whitecaps need an injection of life as they travel to Real Salt Lake this weekend to contest an important Major League Soccer game. Three consecutive draws—including a nervy 1-1 with LAFC, a goalless stalemate in Austin, and an underwhelming result against Canadian Championship side Valour FC—have disrupted Vancouver Whitecaps' rhythm at an inopportune time.With the CONCACAF Champions Cup Final approaching and a number of star players likely to be absent from future league matches due to international commitments, this contest against Real Salt Lake acquires added significance.The timing makes their visit to Real Salt Lake even more crucial. To their good fortune, the last time these two teams met was only three weeks ago, when Vancouver picked up a 2-1 home victory with a brilliant solo strike by Jayden Nelson and a cool finish from Tristan Blackmon.Real Salt Lake, on the other hand, is stuck in awful form with only one win from their previous seven games. America First Field has traditionally been a daunting proposition for RSL, but this season, they've taken a paltry seven points from six home matches. The 'Caps have not fared well in Utah, either, winning only two of 16 all-time trips. Their last win in Salt Lake was in 2020, with their other coming in 2015.Real Salt Lake's greatest threat is still Diego Luna , who has seven goals this season and remains one of the top players on a team that is thin up front.The next best offensive player on the team has but a single goal, which demonstrates the goal-scoring burden Luna bears.Also read: Report: New York City FC leads MLS race to sign Luka Modric amid Dinamo Zagreb uncertainty With pressure building and make-or-break fixtures looming, both Real Salt Lake and Vancouver Whitecaps have a lot to gain. A victory for the Whitecaps would not only snap a streak of three consecutive draws but also provide some padding to counteract roster woes on the horizon. For Real Salt Lake, it's about turning around an alarming slump and holding home sweet home, where victories have not come easily in 2025.","Vancouver Whitecaps need an injection of life as they travel to Real Salt Lake this weekend.

Who is Antonela Roccuzzo? The stunning story of Lionel Messi’s lifelong love,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/news/who-is-antonela-roccuzzo-the-stunning-story-of-lionel-messis-lifelong-love/articleshow/121379617.cms,"Image Source: Getty

Childhood meetings, shy moments, and handwritten promises

From quiet support to a life together

Long before becoming one of the best football players ever, Lionel Messi dreamed of success while living in Rosario, Argentina, and had an undying crush. The crush was Antonela Roccuzzo. The two found love in their childhood, away from fame and cameras, and formed a bond over years full of hard work, belief, and fate.What they felt when they were kids has now turned into a close relationship many admire, as they stayed loyal to one another even though life led them in different ways. She remained part of Messi’s life as he rose in fame and moved into new homes, always quietly and steadily.Lionel Messi first saw Antonela when he was nine. He had gone to play video games at his friend Lucas Scaglia’s house — Antonela’s cousin. She walked in, and something clicked for him. Too shy to say much, he asked Lucas who she was and couldn’t stop thinking about her after that day.Later, Messi paid Lucas more regular visits, all while hoping they could see each other. In 2000, he moved to Spain to focus on football, and the two drifted apart but not too far. Messi would write to her, explaining that he hoped they could be together in the future. Even across countries, that early spark never really faded.In 2005, tragedy brought them back together. Antonela lost a close friend in a car accident. Messi, still in Spain, flew back to be by her side. That moment marked a shift — from childhood friends to something deeper. They kept their relationship private at first, but by 2007, Antonela had told friends. Messi confirmed it publicly two years later.Their family grew fast after that. In 2012, their first child, Rodriquez Thiago, was born, followed by Mateo in 2015 and Ciro in 2018. Even more, Messi got the names of his children tattooed on his leg to symbolise what meant most to him.Also Read: Lionel Messi finally reveals one goal that means the most in his iconic career They married in Rosario in 2017, with football celebrities, family, and friends attending. But what really made it unique was that their lives came together at the end. Antonela continues to cheer Messi on from the stands, often with their kids by her side. No matter if her husband wins trophies or feels pressure, she is always there, just like the girl who left the young Messi unable to speak when they met.Many times, he has spoken about how she keeps everything in the family together and is its heart. Their romance doesn’t only seem romantic; it’s true to life. It’s always good to remember that those who’ve been with you through everything often matter the most.","Lionel Messi first saw Antonela Roccuzzo when he was nine.

Stoffel Vandoorne shares their strategy for Tokyo race

It cannot be just a coincidence that Maserati MSG Racing driver Stoffel Vandoorne started from the 14th position on the grid and went on to win the Tokyo E-Prix Round 8. He even managed to beat Nissan’s Oliver Rowland, who had started from pole. Vandoorne shined while others struggled with poor visibility, a slippery track, and grip issues as it rained cats and dogs during the Tokyo race. Not only that, he also recovered from a spin on the wet track to cross the finish line first. The Tokyo winner says it’s all because of how their plan fell in place to perfection.Stoffel Vandoorne revealed that their winning strategy involved a calculated risk of taking the Pit Boost early in the race, which could have worked in their favor if there had been a race stoppage, allowing them to save time during the gap.""It was not an easy race, but a lot of opportunities with the rain and the management. We kind of gamble a little bit with our strategy but it was also calculated at the same time. The plan perfectly played in our hands, and the chances of this happening in Formula E are very, very slim,” Vandoorne told Formula E in an interview.""It was difficult because I had to manage so many things. I was on the radio with my engineer in between laps and he was giving me advice on the gap that I had to Oliver (Rowland) to make sure I was safe enough with my energy.I was struggling, and I was down to 10% at some point and I had to bring the car home so there was a lot of management to do,"" he added.Vandoorne moved to Maserati MSG Racing last season and is in love with his new team. Talking about the same, he said, ""I’m just happy for the team, for myself, it’s been a little while.

Reflecting on the moment, the Nissan driver told Formulae.com, ""I was already tired after qualifying. I was feeling pretty stressed with everything. There was a lot of pressure to go through. I was looking forward to the race being over, to be honest, and when it was over... when I saw her face I just couldn't help but be super emotional.""[The atmosphere] was amazing.

Taylor Barnard wins podium in Tokyo

If there is anyone as unstoppable as Oliver Rowland this season, then it’s his young friend Taylor Barnard , who joined him on the podium at the Tokyo E-Prix .

I was cheering in front of the TV!”Talking after his podium finish, Barnard said, “To be honest, FP2 this morning was great - it was not expected and I’ve not really driven that much in the rain.Of course that was my first session in the wet, so to be honest the turnaround from yesterday was incredible. We didn’t really expect any racing this afternoon - the weather was really bad - so for it to dry off enough that we could race was really surprising, and to get another podium was incredible.

Pascal Wehrlein isn’t too happy after Tokyo race

TAG Heuer Porsche driver Pascal Wehrlein wasn’t entirely happy despite taking the number 2 spot on the podium on day two of the Tokyo E-Prix . He said he didn’t have the championship points in mind, even though he earned 18 points in the Round 9 race, as he genuinely wanted to win that race. He currently stands in second position in the 2025 Formula E Driver Standings .Taking to Instagram, Pascal Wehrlein shared a picture from the Tokyo E-Prix and wrote, “P2! Strong fight - shame about the safety car in the end. Thank you Tokyo and all the fans! Arigatō.” The safety car had come out at a crucial moment when NEOM McLaren driver Taylor Barnard went into the barrier.Opening up about the race, Wehrlein said, “It was an important day in general I think, as yesterday was very tricky. At the moment I’m still a bit disappointed because I think we could have done better, but there was just no way to defend my position when Oli [Rowland] was in Attack Mode. I did everything right and probably we need to analyse what we could have done better, but still, second is a good result with Dan [Ticktum] in P3. It’s a very strong day for our package, which on the other side makes all of us happy.”He appeared calm and composed during the press conference as well. “We could have done things a bit differently to finish the race in first place. So on one side, a bit disappointed, I really wanted to win that race. On the other side, it was a good result for the team P3, strong day for us. It is what it is,” he said.Pascal Wehrlein currently stands second in the Formula E Driver Standings with 84 points.

They also perform on a level which is super high. For us, it’s a bit up and down. We were also unlucky in some situations. For me it’s trying to maximize every race. Probably if I was thinking about the championship, I wouldn’t be so disappointed about P2. I am just looking race to race.

I was not a master of strategy in the first half of the race, I was pretty disappointed in myself.

First ever podium finish for Dan Ticktum

Dan Ticktum couldn’t hide his emotions after securing the first podium finish of his Formula E career, coming home third at the Tokyo E-Prix Round 9 on Sunday. The race was won by Nissan’s Oliver Rowland, who took a significant step closer to clinching the world championship title. Ticktum, driving for Cupra Kiro, was visibly elated after the race and shared a heartfelt message with his team over the radio.“Very good, gentlemen. Great job. Well done, everyone. I am so happy for you guys, I really am. Everyone doubts me, but I’m going to start proving them wrong. That’s nice. Many drivers are giving me thumbs up—how lovely. Right, I want a beer,” he said over the team radio.Sharing his feelings after the podium win, Dan Ticktum said: “It feels pretty good! I’m already like ‘if we had done this or done that’ I could have won, but I’m very happy overall and it’s a big boost for the team. I just don’t feel like we’ve ever had a breakthrough this season and that’s it. We’re really competing consistently at the top now across all conditions and the team executed a pretty flawless weekend - so I’m happy.”Talking further about the Tokyo race, he added, “There’s not a huge amount I could have done, there was quite a long time when I was forced to lead which was obviously not ideal, and then when me and Pascal [Wehrlein] went to take Attack Mode, Oli [Rowland] got in between us. I don’t know what more we could have done from our side really, just different strategies and it didn’t quite work out for P1 or P2, but ‘Driver of the Day’, I’ll take that - I thought everyone hated me!

Shubman Gill story: From a remote village near the border to India’s Test captain

“

India Test squad for England tour: Shubman Gill to lead, Rishabh Pant his deputy





Dubai: In the spring of 2021, an 18-year-old qualifier, flaunting muscular arms in a navy tank, sparked Rafael Nadal vibes at Roland Garros. Some four year later, for the first French Open after Nadal’s retirement from the sport, Carlos Alcaraz strides into the Avenue Gordon-Bennett venue as defending champion, also displaying some of the legendary Spaniard’s compulsive obsessiveness when arranging bottles around his courtside seat.There will be versions of Nadal – shoulder-length tresses, knickerbocker shorts, cut-off tees and fashion statement bandanas charging across this ochre-soaked landscape – in the years to come. But another Nadal? Like the one that burst onto tennis consciousness 20-years-ago in acid green cut-offs to claim the first of his 14 Coupe des Mousquetaires trophies on his tournament debut…. there is but one Eiffel Tower.Iga Swiatek, the four-time Roland Garros champion, who is on her shakiest run on the surface since she first triumphed here in 2020, comes into the second major of the year without a tournament win in the first five months of the season.The Pole, who strikes a Nadalesque forehand (using a western grip in contrast to Nadal's semi-western) is a huge admirer of. Swiatek was in the stands when Nadal rallied from a two-set deficit to claim his 21major title at the Australian Open three years ago.It was really inspiring,” Swiatek said then of the Melbourne Park final, where Daniil Medvedev had the veteran Nadal in wraps early in the match. “I thought it's going to be pretty hard for Rafa to get the score around. I was thinking during the match that if he's going to win it's going to be mind-blowing, he's going to show why he's Rafa, why he won so many Grand Slams.”Nadal’s nerve is perhaps what Swiatek will look to replicate as she kicks off her seventh French Open campaign, where on Sunday, the opening day of the clay court fortnight, a ceremony in honour of Nadal will play out on Court Philippe Chatrier.Quiz: Who's that IPL player? “I really want to watch it,” Swiatek said of the ceremony, “For sure I'm going to cry. We should all kind of get together and celebrate Rafa and what he did for our sport, what kind of inspiration he was and still is.”World No.1 Jannik Sinner reeled off Nadal’s strengths on the surface like a school boy reciting mathematical tables he had painstakingly drilled into his head – court coverage, court position, spin, physical shape…“He deserves an amazing ceremony, not only because of the player he is, but also how he behaved on court. Being humble and being a successful tennis player, he showed that this is possible,” the 23-year-old Italian said. “I was lucky to know him a little bit better. He's exactly how you guys see him. He's not faking anything. A role model for all of us.”British world No.5 Jack Draper, who like Nadal, plays tennis with his left hand, but writes with his right hand, has carved a solidity into his two-handed backhand, where the right hand steers the stroke.“Obviously (when) playing a righty, we're able to get it into their backhands more,” Draper said of the strategy Nadal employed against Roger Federer. “For me my biggest strength is probably the fact that I’m naturally right-handed. My backhand is a shot which I've always been really confident on. So when right-handers go to my backhand it feels like a great shot for me.”On these picturesque courts, there will be shades of Nadal in the next couple of weeks and beyond --- the spin, the technique, the forehand and the fire -- but that indefatigable spirit -- the 22-time major winner’s shot that made the impossible possible is his signature. Unalloyed steel.",Rafael Nadal will be honoured at the French Open on Sunday. The 22-time major winner retired from the sport in 2011. Carlos Alcaraz is the defending champion at Roland Garros. World No.1 Jannik Sinner says Nadal's biggest strength is his backhand.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121383565,imgsize-82602,width-400,resizemode-4/121383565.jpg"

Shubman Gill story: From a remote village near the border to India’s Test captain

Former world number one Naomi Osaka is preparing for her French Open campaign at Roland Garros, expressing optimism about her tennis comeback after returning to the world's top 50. The four-time Grand Slam champion, who took a break in 2023 for the birth of her daughter, has shown promising signs of form in 2024, including a near-victory against eventual winner Iga Swiatek.Osaka secured her first tournament victory since the 2021 Australian Open at a second-tier Challenger event in Saint-Malo this month. She has also made significant progress in major competitions, advancing to the last 16 at both the Miami and Italian Opens.""I think I'm enjoying the time more. I'm enjoying seeing the newer players coming up. I don't know. Feels like the circle of life a little bit,"" Osaka said at Roland Garros on Saturday.""I think for me I know that I came back and I'm choosing to spend this time away from my daughter in order to attempt to achieve things, so I have to make the most out of that time. Coming here or playing any tournament without a positive mentality would just be pointless.""The Japanese star, who has been open about her struggles with depression and mental health, addressed her decision to compete in the Saint-Malo Challenger event.""I think the decision itself was kind of difficult, because in your mind, you do have a little bit of pride. There was a lot of pressure. I wouldn't really say it was to not lose, but it was more like I had in the back of my head, 'I wonder what people would say about me if I lost here'. Granted, I should never be thinking about that when I'm playing a tennis match... But I got over it.""Quiz: Who's that IPL player? Osaka's French Open preparations faced an early challenge with a 5:00 am anti-doping test on Saturday. She shared her experience with the unexpected wake-up call.""Today was kind of scary, because the last year I was here they also came at 5:00 am, and the lady couldn't find my veins at all. I had huge bruises on my arms for a while. Thankfully it wasn't the same lady. No shade to her.""The 27-year-old player will face Spanish 10th seed Paula Badosa in the first round. She has never progressed beyond the third round at the French Open.""It's kind of crazy that we have both been on tour but we haven't played each other yet. I think I'm going to be nervous because it is the first round, and I'm always nervous in the first round. Hopefully they'll put us on a really good court.""Osaka revealed her excitement about wearing flower-inspired outfits at Roland Garros, including cherry blossom-themed shoes.""I'm really excited about the kit, because I designed it. I don't know if you can see from all the way over here, but I did my nails and they're sakura-themed too.""The match against Badosa is scheduled for either Monday or Tuesday at Roland Garros.",Naomi Osaka is preparing for her French Open campaign at Roland Garros.

India Test squad for England tour: Shubman Gill to lead, Rishabh Pant his deputy

Shubman Gill story: From a remote village near the border to India’s Test captain

Paris: Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz, the two best male tennis players in the world, both born in the 2000s, have been shaping for a rivalry that pits great contrasts -- styles, mentalities and personalities -- across the net.The 23-year-old Italian’s steel versus the 22-year-old Spaniard’s staggering range, the world No.1’s sangfroid versus Alcaraz’s sense of adventure. The calm and storm of the sport, are the top-two seeds of the French Open , starting Sunday. They are the youngest top two seeds at a major since the 2006 US Open, when a 25-year-old Roger Federer and a 20-year-old Rafael Nadal bookended the men’s draw.On a windy Friday at Roland Garros, where the highs hovered around the late teens on the centigrade scale, Sinner and Alcaraz’ paths crossed on Court Philippe Chatrier where they both had practice sessions scheduled in the afternoon. The 22-year-old Spaniard was winding up when Sinner walked in behind his coach Aussie Darren Cahill. The top-seed went over to Alcaraz’ side and waited for him, who owns a Tour-leading 30 match wins in 2025, to finish an exchange, before throwing an arm around him.The rivalry, which kickstarted in the November of 2021with the world still reeling from the effects of Covid-19, seemed to have it all. Shades of Rafael Nadal-Roger Federer all over again, they were friendly but their matches were fierce, they were different yet united by a passion, but there may be more.A pair of personable young men, leaders of their sport, might be caught in a crossfire of the unspoken word.Alcaraz, who won the pairs’ last meeting in the final at Rome last weekend, bringing to an end Sinner’s 26-match win streak, leads the head-to-head 7-4, while tying with the world No.1 at 19 titles apiece.Sinner, who returned to competition after serving a three-month ban for returning positive tests for Clostebol, a banned anabolic steroid, held forth on the three months, saying that there had been players in the time, who he didn’t expect had reached out to him, while there were others, who he was expecting to hear from, who hadn’t reached out.Alcaraz was asked if he thought Sinner was referring to him.“I didn't call him in those three months, but it wasn't about if I agreed or not (with the ban),’ Alcaraz said. ‘I was playing, I was in my feelings.’Quiz: Who's that IPL player? The telephone call that wasn’t made aside, Sinner and Alcaraz agree they bring more to the court when they face each other.“When we play there is a little extra attention,” said Sinner. “While he is winning I feel that my practice sessions are getting more intense.”“I'm even more focused when I play against him,” the gifted four-time major winner said. “I feel a little bit different when I'm going to face him. Jannik has that aura. When you see him at the other side of the net, it's kind of different. I feel like it is a different energy when we face each other than when we face other players.”If the rivalry were to be renewed at Roland Garros, Sinner must survive a thorny path. The world No.1 opens against Frenchman Arthur Rinderknech and could play the 14-seeded Frenchman Arthur Fils or Andrey Rublev in the fourth round, Jack Draper or Alex de Minaur in the last eight and maybe Alexander Zverev or the 24-time major winner Novak Djokovic in the semis.Alcaraz starts against veteran Japanese Kei Nishikori and could run into giant Frenchman Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard in the third round, and Ben Shelton or Stefanos Tsitsipas in the fourth-round, possibly Casper Ruud in the quarterfinals and maybe Taylor Fritz, Lorenzo Musetti or Holger Rune in the semi-finals.The road to the final is long and the weather promises to be whimsical, but fans in the French capital will hope the final will be a rematch of last year’s semi-final, which the Spaniard won.“It’s great to have matchups that make (fans) excited. It was Borg-McEnroe, Rafa-Roger or Djokovic, the big three against each other,” the defending champion said of rivalries. “Right now people are excited every time I'm facing Jannik. Our matches are really high quality. People probably who don't like watching tennis, started to watch tennis (because of these matches).”For now, Roland Garros would like another, a 12career meeting of the two best Generation Z players, who are looking to make history.",Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner are the top-two seeds at the French Open. They are the youngest top two seeds at a major since the 2006 US Open. Sinner returned to competition after serving a three-month ban for returning positive tests for Clostebol.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121373546,imgsize-132838,width-400,resizemode-4/121373546.jpg"

Poll Do you think Coco Gauff will perform better at this year's French Open compared to her past finals? Yes, she has gained valuable experience. No, past disappointments may hinder her.

American tennis player Coco Gauff, 21, is looking to transform her recent runner-up disappointments in Madrid and Rome clay tournaments into motivation for the upcoming French Open in Paris, where she previously reached the finals in 2022 and won the doubles title last year.Gauff enters the French Open following consecutive finals losses to world number one Aryna Sabalenka and Italy's Jasmine Paolini in Roland Garros warm-up tournaments.The 2018 French Open junior champion will face 93rd-ranked Australian Olivia Gadecki in her opening match on the red clay surface.Reflecting on her 2022 French Open final loss to Iga Swiatek, Gauff said: ""I think immediately after it was a tough feeling for me. I just felt like maybe I could never overcome that. Then I just turned it into motivation. I knew that, I don't know, just had a deep-down gut (feeling) that I was going to be in a final position again. I was like, I'm not going to go out like that. If I go out, I'm going to leave with my head held high. So I was able to approach that US Open final differently. But I definitely think I needed that finals loss to reach this point, for sure.""Gauff went on to win the US Open title a year after her French Open final appearance.Speaking about her comfort level on clay courts, Gauff said: ""Honestly, I feel like when I was young, I just played on it. I feel like at that time I didn't gauge surfaces or anything. I felt like I should just be good at everything. I definitely think it's something that I'm comfortable on. I mainly credit it to me probably sliding a lot on a hard court so when I go on clay it just feels a lot easier.""Her recent clay court performances have boosted her confidence heading into Roland Garros.Regarding her clay season results, Gauff stated: ""It definitely gives me a lot of confidence, but I think I'm just putting those results in the past and focusing on the next two weeks here.""Last year, Gauff claimed the Roland Garros doubles title partnering with Katerina Siniakova, further cementing her credentials on the clay surface.","American tennis player Coco Gauff, 21, is looking to transform her recent runner-up disappointments in Madrid and Rome clay tournaments into motivation for the upcoming French Open in Paris.

Tennis Fan Pope Leo XIV Meets With Italian Player Jannik Sinner, But 'Refuses' To Play With Him

Poll Do you believe the crowd's support will affect Sinner's performance? Yes, positively Yes, negatively No, it won't matter

World number one tennis player Jannik Sinner, returning from a three-month doping ban, addressed the media on Friday about his expectations for the French Open, acknowledging he anticipates a different atmosphere when he faces French player Arthur Rinderknech in the first round at Roland Garros.Sinner recently made his comeback at the Italian Open, reaching the final before losing to Carlos Alcaraz. The 23-year-old Italian had not played since winning the Australian Open in January.The tennis star served a doping suspension after testing positive twice in March last year for traces of clostebol, which doping authorities accepted was accidental contamination.""It's definitely going to be different. I know that. But I don't think they have something against me, no? It's right that they support the players who are from here, who are local here. It's the same when I play against American players in the US Open. So it's normal. You know, I got an amazing atmosphere in Rome because I'm Italian. It's right that the player who play in this city or country, that they got more support. So I know that. Last year I played also against some French players here.So I know a little bit what to expect.""When questioned about potential hostile reception in Paris following his doping suspension, Sinner remained uncertain, stating: ""Different moment because whatever happened happened. So let's see. I cannot answer that question.""Reflecting on his performance in Rome, Sinner acknowledged room for improvement. His best French Open performance was reaching the semi-finals last year, where he lost to eventual champion Alcaraz in five sets.""For sure it was great after three months coming back making final. It was my first big final on clay, which is not to underrate, because we worked a lot for that, but also it was a great feeling to be part of this final. Hopefully we are on time to make small changes for here. There are no miracles. I need some time. Matches are different than practice sessions.""The Italian champion expressed awareness of the challenges ahead in the Grand Slam format: ""But, you know, best-of-five is going to be a great test for me, trying to understand where I am. Yeah, let's see how my body will respond here. We have seen a couple of things where I can improve, and Grand Slams are just different. You know, you have to be mentally ready, physically too trying to use the right energy. It's all about being consistent and solid. ""The 72nd-ranked Frenchman Rinderknech awaits Sinner in what will be a challenging first-round match at Roland Garros, where the Italian expects to face a predominantly pro-French crowd.","World number one tennis player Jannik Sinner is returning from a three-month doping ban.

Why Mohammed Shami needs to return in India colours before World Cup

Poll Do you think displaying the Palestinian flag during a cricket match is acceptable? Yes, it's a form of expression. No, it politicizes sports. It depends on the context.





NEW DELHI: The Jammu and Kashmir Police have launched an investigation after a Palestinian flag was spotted during a local cricket match in Jammu, prompting the summoning of a player and the organiser of a privately run tournament for questioning.The incident occurred on Wednesday during a match between JK11 Kings and Jammu Trailblazers in the ongoing Jammu and Kashmir Champions League. Television footage showed a cricketer batting with a helmet bearing the Palestinian flag on its front, an image that quickly circulated on social media and drew the attention of authorities.“One cricket player and organiser of the tournament has been called for questioning by J&K Police regarding the use of the Palestine flag on his helmet during a cricket match at a private tournament in Jammu,” police said in an official statement, according to India Today. The cricketer has been identified as Furqan Bhat, while the tournament organiser is Zahid Bhat.Police officials said they are examining the circumstances under which the flag was displayed and whether any permissions were obtained. Investigators are also checking for violations of tournament guidelines and assessing the intent behind displaying the flag during a sporting event. “Police are verifying the facts and investigating the matter,” a senior official said, adding that no action has been taken so far and any further steps will depend on the outcome of due diligence.The Jammu and Kashmir Cricket Association (JKCA) has distanced itself from the event, confirming that the tournament is not recognised by the state body or any national authority. “The league is not recognised by JKCA,” Brig Anil Gupta (Retd), Member Administration of the JKCA, told IANS, noting that the player involved was not registered with the association or its affiliates. BCCI rules prohibit players from participating in unrecognised leagues.Police reportedly rushed to the venue after the image went viral and have also begun probing the unauthorised tournament itself. This is the second privately organised league from Jammu and Kashmir to come under scrutiny in recent months, following the collapse of the Indian Heaven Premier League in Srinagar, where organisers allegedly fled midway, leaving players and officials stranded.","A Palestinian flag was spotted during a local cricket match in Jammu, prompting the summoning of a player and the organiser of a privately run tournament.

England captain Ben Stokes has strongly backed head coach Brendon McCullum ahead of the final Test of the Ashes 2025–26 at the Sydney Cricket Ground. Even though England have already lost the series, Stokes made it clear that he still believes in McCullum and feels their partnership is very important for the team’s future.Stokes said he has no doubts about wanting McCullum to continue as England’s head coach. At the same time, he accepted that losing the Ashes means both of them must take a hard look at what has gone wrong and find ways to improve the team.Speaking before the Sydney Test, Stokes said, ""There is no doubt in my mind that Brendon and I are the right people to carry on doing this for the near future. I have thoroughly enjoyed the time I have worked with Brendon. I cannot see there being someone else who I could take this team with from where we are now to even bigger heights.""He added that the responsibility lies with both the captain and the coach to raise the team’s level.""So for us as captain and coach, when we do have the time off, we need to put our heads together and go, What is it that we think we need to do to go to the next level?’’ Stokes said.Brendon McCullum took charge of England’s men’s Test team in May 2022.His appointment marked the beginning of the aggressive and positive style of play known as “Bazball.”The approach brought quick success, and in 2024, McCullum was named England’s all-format coach. He officially began handling both Test and white-ball teams in January 2025.Under Stokes and McCullum, England made a strong start.They won 10 of their first 11 Test matches together, which raised expectations. However, results have been inconsistent since then.In their last 34 Tests, England have won 16 and lost 16, with two matches ending in draws.They have also failed to win a major five-Test series against traditional rivals Australia or India.In the ongoing Ashes series, England are trailing Australia 3-1.While the trophy is already out of reach, England will be keen to finish the tour on a positive note.

South Africa squad:





South Africa have announced their squad for the upcoming T20 World Cup and made a few big and surprising decisions. Young fast bowler Kwena Maphaka and top-order batter Jason Smith have been included in the team. However, there is no place for batters Ryan Rickelton and Tristan Stubbs.Jason Smith’s selection comes after his strong recent performances. He has been in good form in T20 cricket and earned his spot ahead of Stubbs, who was part of South Africa’s squad that finished runners-up in the 2024 T20 World Cup.Smith made his T20I debut in 2024 and has a strike rate of 128.30. He is currently playing for MI Cape Town in the SA20 league. One of his best recent knocks came in the T20 Challenge in November, where he smashed an unbeaten 68 runs off just 19 balls to help the Dolphins reach the playoffs.Ryan Rickelton, on the other hand, could not make the cut in a team already filled with top-order players.Captain Aiden Markram and wicketkeeper-batter Quinton de Kock are among the main options at the top of the order. Along with Smith and Maphaka, several players have received their first-ever T20 World Cup call-up.These include Corbin Bosch, Dewald Brevis, Tony de Zorzi, Donovan Ferreira, and George Linde.South Africa head coach Shukri Conrad spoke about the team’s preparation and conditions in the subcontinent.He said, “We are returning to the subcontinent, where we recently competed against hosts India. The experience we gained playing in those conditions will undoubtedly benefit us as we head into this tournament.“Many of the players selected for the World Cup squad were on that trip and experienced first-hand the pitches that we will likely encounter and that will stand them in good stead once we get to India.”Conrad also added, “We do have one more T20I series against the West Indies before we depart for the World Cup, and that squad will be announced later this month.”Star fast bowler Kagiso Rabada returns to the T20I side after missing the recent tour of India due to a rib injury.Anrich Nortje is also back in the squad after finishing as South Africa’s leading wicket-taker in the 2024 T20 World Cup.South Africa are placed in Group D along with Afghanistan, Canada, New Zealand, and the UAE.

Former England spinner Monty Panesar has said that the BCCI should have done more to honour some of India’s biggest cricket stars. He believes that Virat Kohli Rohit Sharma , and Ravichandran Ashwin deserved proper farewell Test matches before retiring from international cricket.Panesar feels that India missed an important chance to celebrate the careers of these players. He compared India’s approach with England, where retired players are often given special farewell games. According to him, such matches show respect for players who have given many years to the sport.Speaking to IANS, Panesar said, ""The BCCI should have planned farewell Test matches for R Ashwin, Rohit Sharma, and Virat Kohli. They deserved that respect. England celebrate its players when they retire — for example, Stuart Broad and James Anderson were given great farewells — but India fall short in this regard.""Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma retired from Test cricket in May last year. Ravichandran Ashwin announced his retirement from international cricket after the third Test of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy against Australia in December 2024.Kohli is considered one of the greatest batters of the modern era. He ended his 14-year Test career with 9,230 runs in 123 matches at an average of 46.85. He scored 30 centuries and 31 half-centuries. Kohli also had a successful run as India’s Test captain, finishing as the fourth-most successful skipper in Test history.Rohit Sharma played 67 Test matches and scored 4,301 runs at an average of 40.57. He hit 12 centuries and 18 fifties. As an opener, his average was even better at 42.81. Under his leadership, India reached the final of the 2023 World Test Championship, where they finished runners-up.Ravichandran Ashwin ended his Test career with 537 wickets in 106 matches at an average of 24. He is India’s second-highest wicket-taker in Tests after Anil Kumble. Ashwin also contributed with the bat, scoring six centuries and 14 half-centuries. His final international match was the day-night Test in Adelaide.In white-ball cricket, Ashwin took 228 wickets across ODIs and T20Is. Overall, he finished with 765 international wickets and was part of India’s 2011 World Cup and 2013 Champions Trophy-winning teams.","Former England spinner Monty Panesar has said that the BCCI should have done more to honour some of India’s biggest cricket stars.

They need you seriously.""Gillespie did not hesitate in responding. He replied with just two words: “No thanks.”While the former Australian bowler has not elaborated on his answer, Gillespie’s recent experience with the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) may also have influenced his thinking.After dealing with challenges in Pakistan, he may be cautious about taking on another high-profile role in the subcontinent, especially in an environment he is not fully familiar with.Despite turning down the India role, Gillespie remains highly respected as a red-ball coach.

Who was Fred Spofforth?

Poll In your opinion, how important is a hat-trick in a cricket match? Very important Somewhat important Not important at all

How the historic Melbourne Test transpired in which Spofforth took the first hat-trick in Test cricket:







On this day — January 2 — 147 years ago, Australian fast bowler Fred Spofforth became the first bowler to take a hat-trick in Test cricket history. Spofforth achieved the historic feat at the Melbourne Cricket Ground way back in 1879, helping the hosts bundle out England for 113 in the first innings of the Test match.A hat-trick in cricket remains a fascinating achievement for bowlers even today because of its impact on the proceedings of a contest. It can turn the momentum upside down as the batting line-up loses three wickets in three balls, giving the bowling side a clear edge.Spofforth's achievement almost one-and-a-half centuries ago was one such turning point in the contest, leaving the opponents struggling to put up a fight as Australia won the match by 10 wickets. It was just the second Test match for Spofforth, and he knocked over three English batters in consecutive deliveries to start one of the most fascinating feats in the game of cricket.The tall pacer was born on September 9, 1853, in Balmain, Sydney. The right-arm fast bowler made his international debut for Australia against England at Melbourne in March 1877.He went on to play 18 matches for Australia in his 10-year international career from 1877 to 1887, taking an impressive 94 wickets at a stunning average of 18.41.He took seven five-wicket hauls in his career and four ten-wicket hauls, with best bowling figures of 7 for 44.The Sydney Test in January 1887 against England was his last appearance for the Aussies.Even though his Test career lasted just 10 years, Spofforth had a long 23-year first-class career from 1874/75 to 1887/88. He took an astounding 853 wickets in 155 first-class matches, including 84 five-wicket hauls and 32 ten-wicket match hauls. His career-best first-class figures were 9 for 18, and he had a career first-class bowling average of a sub-15 — 14.95.After making his debut at the same venue in March 1877, Spofforth got the chance to represent Australia again after more than a year, in January 1879. Spofforth took just four wickets in his debut match, but the story was about to turn drastically this time around.England opted to bat first after winning the toss on that fateful day. Spofforth started with a bang, removing England opener George Ulyett for a duck. His bowling partner Frank Allan then dismissed Alexander Webbe and Bunny Lucas, before Spofforth made Monkey Hornby his second victim of the day. England were struggling at 14/4 at that time before slowly reaching 26 for 4.Spofforth then produced the most famous three consecutive deliveries to create Test history. He removed The Revd Vernon Royle, Francis MacKinnon and Tom Emmett to reduce England to 26/7. The burst gave Spofforth his first Test five-wicket haul too.England were in dire straits before captain Lord Harris (33) and Charlie Absolom (52) steadied the ship somewhat with a 63-run stand for the eighth wicket. But the visitors soon folded for 113, with Spofforth taking another wicket to finish with figures of 6 for 48 in 25 overs.Despite Emmett's 7 for 68, Australia managed to take a solid 143-run first-innings lead, scoring 256. Alec Bannerman was the top-scorer for Australia with 73, as seven more batters scored double-digit knocks in the innings.England failed to improve much in the second innings too, with Spofforth and Allan wreaking havoc once again. In fact, Spofforth bettered his career-best figures from the first innings with 7 for 62 in 35 overs in the second. There was no hat-trick in the second innings, but Spofforth signed off the match with two five-wicket hauls and a match haul of 13 for 110.Six England batters crossed the double-digit mark in their second innings, compared to just two in the first, but they managed to put up only 160 on the board, giving Australia a mere 18-run target. Australia knocked off the target in just 2.3 overs to win the match by a commanding 10 wickets.It was a stunning show from Spofforth — two five-wicket hauls in the match and a historic first hat-trick in Test cricket.",Fred Spofforth became the first bowler to take a hat-trick in Test cricket history.

India’s top footballers have come together to make an emotional appeal to FIFA, asking the world governing body to step in as the Indian Super League (ISL) remains suspended with no clear return date. The appeal includes senior Indian players like Sunil Chhetri , Gurpreet Singh Sandhu and Sandhesh Jhingan, along with several foreign players who play in the ISL.The players said the continued delay of the 2025–26 ISL season has created deep uncertainty and fear. They warned that Indian football is slowly moving towards a complete standstill if the situation is not resolved soon.""It's January and we should be on your screens as apart of a competitive football game in the Indian Super League,” Gurpreet said in a joint video shared on social media.""Instead, here we are driven by fear and desperation to say aloud something which we all know,"" Jhingan added.In the video, the players said that the All India Football Federation (AIFF) is no longer able to manage the crisis and protect the future of football in the country. They asked FIFA to intervene and help bring stability back to the game.""But more importantly, we are here to make a plea. Indian football governance is no longer able to fulfil its responsibilities. We are now staring at a permanent paralysis. This is the last-ditch effort to save what we can.So we are calling the FIFA to step in and do what it takes to save Indian football,"" the players said.They also made it clear that their message was not political but based on urgent need.""We hope this message gets to the power that are in Zurich. This call is not political, it is not driven by confrontation but by necessity. It might sound like a big word but the truth is that we are facing a humanitarian, sporting and economic crisis. And of course, we need rescuing at the earliest. We just want to play football, please help us do it,” they said.Sunil Chhetri ended the appeal by stressing the impact on everyone involved. ""Players, staff, owners and the fans deserve clarity, protection and more importantly, a future,” he added.The ISL season was put on hold in July due to uncertainty over the renewal of the Master Rights Agreement between the AIFF and Football Sports Development Limited (FSDL). The deal expired in December, leading to legal issues and Supreme Court involvement. A fresh tender for ISL’s commercial rights also failed to attract bidders.With the season still delayed, clubs are worried about finances and player contracts. Thirteen of the fourteen ISL clubs have told the AIFF they may play if there is no participation fee and the federation covers operational costs.The delay also threatens clubs’ chances of qualifying for the AFC Champions League 2, as they may not meet the minimum match requirement.",India's top footballers have come together to make an emotional appeal to FIFA.

Poll Should Pep Guardiola consider a change in tactics after the frustrating draw? Yes, definitely No, the current tactics will work Only minor adjustments are needed





Manchester City missed the chance to keep pace with Arsenal at the top of the Premier League after being held to a frustrating 0-0 draw by Sunderland on Thursday, as a low-scoring start to 2026 saw three of four New Year’s Day fixtures end without a goal.City now trail league leaders Arsenal by four points after failing to capitalise on the Gunners’ emphatic 4-1 demolition of Aston Villa earlier in the week. Pep Guardiola’s side had won eight straight matches to close out 2025, but were unable to break down a resilient Sunderland team that preserved its unbeaten home record since returning to the top flight.Bernardo Silva thought he had given City an early lead, only for his effort to be ruled out for offside inside the opening six minutes. Despite Sunderland missing six players to the Africa Cup of Nations and centre-back Dan Ballard through injury, the hosts held firm. Goalkeeper Robin Roefs produced a string of fine saves to deny Erling Haaland and Josko Gvardiol, while Savinho blazed over a gilt-edged chance.“It’s a mystery,” Guardiola said. “We created a lot, especially in the second half. We take the point — it’s a long way to go.”Liverpool were also left frustrated after being held to a 0-0 draw by Leeds at Anfield.Reds boss Arne Slot lamented the absence of “individual special moments” as his side struggled without Mohamed Salah and Alexander Isak. Leeds thought they had snatched a late winner through Dominic Calvert-Lewin, but his effort was ruled out for a marginal offside, extending their unbeaten run to six games.Tottenham’s attacking woes continued in another goalless draw away to Brentford on Thomas Frank’s return to the club he once guided into the Premier League. Spurs fans vented their frustration late on, chanting “boring, boring Tottenham,” while Frank admitted, “We don’t create enough. We need to keep working on that.”Elsewhere, Crystal Palace’s winless run stretched to six games after a 1-1 draw with Fulham. Jean-Philippe Mateta opened the scoring before Tom Cairney struck a fine equaliser.","Manchester City were held to a frustrating 0-0 draw by Sunderland.

PANAJI: The All India Football Federation (AIFF) has given clubs 24 hours to confirm their participation and the preferred format for this season’s Indian Super League (ISL).According to sources, the clubs will respond to AIFF before Thursday’s deadline but at least eight of them will seek additional details pertaining to finances.Without a commercial partner, the toptier clubs are not ready to share added financial burden.“Why should the clubs pay for everything,” asked one official. “The AIFF owns the league but has not yet committed to any financial contribution. The clubs should not solely shoulder the responsibility, particularly at a time when we will not have central revenue share and even sponsorships.”The AIFF’s three-member ISL coordination committee has had five meetings with clubs since last week but there is no confirmation on either the format or whether all 14 of them will take part when the league kicks off next month.“AIFF is required to submit the outcome of these meetings to the Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports before Jan 2,” AIFF’s deputy secretary general M Satyanarayan wrote in a letter to club CEOs on Wednesday.The federation has given clubs time till Jan 1 to “confirm participation.”For India to earn an Asian spot, all clubs must play atleast 24 league matches in a season.There’s no time now for a fullfledged league since player contracts, and the season, officially ends May 31.","The All India Football Federation (AIFF) has given clubs 24 hours to confirm their participation and the preferred format for this season's Indian Super League (ISL) According to sources, the clubs will respond to AIFF before Thursday’s deadline but at least eight of them will seek additional details pertaining to finances.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126282790,imgsize-71846,width-400,resizemode-4/fotball-isl-0101.jpg"

Real Madrid have confirmed that Kylian Mbappe has suffered a sprain to his left knee, dealing a significant setback to their pursuit of La Liga leaders Barcelona. The club issued a statement on Wednesday revealing the diagnosis following medical tests, adding that his condition will be monitored over the coming days.The Spanish giants did not provide a clear timeline for the 27-year-old forward’s return. However, a source close to the France international told AFP that Mbappe is expected to be sidelined for a minimum of three weeks.Mbappe’s injury places his availability in serious doubt for Sunday’s home league fixture against Real Betis, Madrid’s first match after the winter break. Carlo Ancelotti’s side currently sit four points behind Barcelona in the title race. The forward could also miss the Spanish Super Cup semi-final against Atletico Madrid in Saudi Arabia on January 8, along with a league encounter against Levante and a Champions League meeting with his former club Monaco.Real Madrid have not disclosed when or how the injury occurred. Mbappe was involved in full training with the squad on Tuesday before undergoing an MRI scan the following day.The setback comes after an exceptional year for Mbappe. In 2025, he matched Cristiano Ronaldo ’s club record of 59 goals in a calendar year and has often been the driving force behind Madrid’s performances, easing pressure on head coach Xabi Alonso.Since arriving on a free transfer from Paris Saint-Germain 18 months ago, Mbappe has scored 73 goals in 83 appearances for the club.He finished last season as La Liga’s leading scorer with 31 goals, four more than Barcelona striker Robert Lewandowski . This campaign, he already has 18 league goals and holds a seven-goal advantage over Barcelona’s Ferran Torres.Mbappe’s absence further compounds Real Madrid’s injury concerns.

RAW TALENTFancy a swig of raw milk? Good for your gut, and legs it seems. Head too. It’s superfood, just ask Super Haaland. He loves to visit a Cheshire farm to get his locally sourced bottles. And as you know, he rarely bottles up in front of goal – scoring 25 times in his 23 matches for City so far.

PSG’s success story in 2025 is one to behold -- How Luis Enrique rebooted the continent’s nearly men into European champions with discipline, teamwork, tactics, belief while deleting the individualist approach.All for one and one for all, Luis’ musketeers reeled in trophy after trophy but there was one battle PSG lost, to former talisman Kylian Mbappe, in the boardroom and the courtroom. In this sabre fencing, Paris employed the slashing technique, cutting off the Frenchman’s salary that included a so-called ‘ethics bonus’. Mad in Madrid, Mbappe’s riposte was of the legal kind. After the back and forth, the court ruled that the former employers pay up unpaid wages of 60m euros. Back in Spain, Mbappe earned some Real love from the Bernabeu faithful, after scoring 59 goals in 59 games, equaling his ‘hero’ Cristiano Ronaldo’s record, the most in a calendar year. How did he celebrate it? Siuuuuu…NO FAN’S LANDThe Big Leagues’ global expansion was put on hold. La Liga president Javier Tebas’ plan to ‘host’ a league match between Barcelona and Villarreal in Miami 7,500-km away from the shores of Spain was cancelled. The league had also chartered planes to take around 2,000 to 3,000 Villarreal fans to the US of A. In Oct, there were league-wide protests, stopping active play to express displeasure. Ultimately, Tebas had to bow down as organisers pulled out. Last week, a high-profile plan to stage a Serie A match -- AC Milan vs. Como -- in Perth was scrapped.DIAMONDS ARE FOREVEROne of the most viral pics of 2025 was of Georgina Rodriguez’s oversized diamond engagement ring reported to be valued between $2 and 5m, the kind of flashy display that one can associate with her fiancé Cristiano Ronaldo.

Salah won it that day, and the tears flowed.Since then, fortunes have taken a different turn for both Liverpool and Mo. After promising and delivering a record-equalling 20th league title in April, ‘the Egyptian king’ found himself on the sidelines, and an outburst against club and gaffer, left him on the brink of an exit as he proceeded to AFCON duty with his legacy under threat and a question mark over his return.In Spain, close on the heels of a successful Euro campaign, Lamine Yamal finds himself ostracized -- from ‘wonderkid’ to ‘bad loser’, with his moves scrutinized in public by a damning jealous social media.

Ryan Rickelton press conference: 'Been tough last couple of months mentally in India'

Florian Wirtz's first Liverpool goal fired the Reds into the Premier League 's top four despite an unconvincing 2-1 win over Wolves on a day both clubs paid tribute to Diogo Jota . Jota, who was killed in a car accident alongside his brother Andre Silva in July, won four trophies after joining Liverpool from Wolves in 2020.Two of his children led the teams out as mascots, while his wife Rute Cardoso watched on from the sidelines.Both sets of fans sang chants in Jota's name in the 18th and 20th minutes -- the shirt numbers he wore during his spells at Molineux and Anfield respectively.""After the tragedy happened until now, I have seen so many special moments -- where the fans remembered him or our players conducted themselves unbelievably in the circumstances,"" said Liverpool boss Arne Slot.""Not only our fans but the fans of away teams have shown the respect both Diogo and his brother deserved. It was special to see his children being the mascot and how emotional it was before the game and then in the 20th minute.""On the field, both clubs have suffered this season with Wolves staring down the barrel of relegation after taking just two points from their opening 18 league games.Liverpool's form has improved of late and Wirtz is beginning to show flashes of the brilliance that lured the English champions into paying Bayer Leverkusen £100 million ($135 million) for the German international.The 22-year-old registered his first Premier League assist last weekend for a goal that came at some cost to Liverpool as Alexander Isak suffered a broken leg in opening the scoring against Tottenham.Shorn of the most expensive player in English football history for the coming months, there is even more pressure on Wirtz to deliver on his hefty price tag.""He's been very important for us throughout the season. But in football it is about results, you are mainly judged on results or on goals and assists,"" added Slot.""I think today he showed much more than just the goal he scored; he was special for us in many parts of the game.""Wirtz finally opened his account in his 23rd Liverpool appearance by prodding home Hugo Ekitike's pass to double the home side's lead.Just 90 seconds earlier, Liverpool had made the breakthrough when Ryan Gravenberch slammed in Jeremie Frimpong's cross.Yet, even with a 2-0 half-time lead against a side on course to become the worst in Premier League history, Slot could not relax.Santiago Bueno exposed Liverpool's frailty from set-pieces to pull a goal back just six minutes into the second half.Slot's men have made a habit of late collapses at Leeds and Tottenham in recent weeks and needed a perfectly-timed tackle from Conor Bradley to deny Jhon Arias a late equaliser.","Liverpool beat Wolves 2-1 in Premier League.

This year, most scrambled to check the Google Maps to find Curacao when the smallest-ever nation, in terms of population and size, qualified for next year’s mammoth World Cup 2026. With 155,000 inhabitants, the Caribbean island was guided to the top tier by Dick Advocaat, the former Rangers and PSV boss who has also worked with eight national teams including his native Netherlands (1992-94).Sebastian Migne never set foot on Haiti, another Caribbean nation, because international flights do not land there. They played all their World Cup home qualifiers in Curacao, some 500 miles across the sea.These football stories are the brightest beacon of 2025. In contrast, the darkness around Indian football seems to have grown deeper, unfathomable, with no light at the end of the tunnel.The year gone by has seen All India Football Federation officials spend more time making rounds of the courts than the national team spent on the field.It might delight a research scholar to know that AIFF has presented itself to the Supreme Court 16 times and counting.The national team has played only 12 matches. None of it, though, will bring cheer to the fans.Never since Independence has Indian football slipped into such a deep abyss. For the first time since 1996, when the national league was begun by then-AIFF president Priya Ranjan Das Munshi, it has stalled.One can say with a heavy heart that the league is an orphan now.The sponsorship ran out. The new occupants of Football House, who took charge in 2022, were aware of the matter. But the negotiations just refused to yield any money, assurance, or hope.Since 2010, the AIFF received Rs 50 crore every year from Football Sports Development Limited (FSDL), a Reliance Industries subsidiary, as part of an agreement. The 15-year contract ran out on Dec 8.It was obvious to all, except those in Football House, that no one wants to waste money to keep Indian football – once called a sleeping giant by Sepp Blatter just over a decade and a half ago – alive and awake.Till reports last came in, the AIFF plans to start the elite league around Feb 7-8 after presenting a 20-year plan to the ISL clubs. In accordance with the constitution, the league will be owned and operated by the AIFF and will “implement the principles of promotion and relegation.”“I am convinced we can start the league and then work out a long-term solution,” said IFA secy Anirban Dutta, a member of the committee to resolve the ISL crisis.All year, the stakeholders went into hair-splitting debates and nuanced offerings but the outcome, sadly, has been zero. Even a few clubs had temporarily stopped paying salaries to the players. There has been a frustrating sense of ennui.Last heard, there was some warmth shown by the beleaguered clubs towards the AIFF’s proposals. The format for a truncated league is expected to be confirmed in the year’s final week.Add to it the dismal performance of the national team. Hours after India lost to Bangladesh in their last Asian Cup qualification engagement, Haiti’s ticket to the World Cup sent euphoric shock waves around the world. To watch India’s matches this year, under coaches Manolo Marquez and Khalid Jamil, was like visiting the dentist with a severe toothache.The Indian senior men’s team failed to qualify for the 2027 AFC Asian Cup, which means no competitive football until at least Nov 2027. That is nearly three years without meaningful matches. One wonders what will be Khalid Jamil’s work schedule now?One question keeps haunting, though. If Curacao are able to hire the services of a world-renowned coach like Advocaat, why could India, claimed to be the fourth-largest economy in the world, never reach beyond the Manolos and the Stimacs and the Koevermans? One can keep waiting for an answer but there will only be silence from the All India Football Federation.Following some creditable performances against Bahrain (2-0) and Brunei (6-0), U-23 coach Naushad Moosa got stuck in Doha. Not one to be easily perturbed, even by the sudden bombing of the Qatari capital, Moosa showered rousing praise on the boys. But his enthusiasm was laced with bleakness.“What’s next for the boys? They will go back to their clubs and warm the bench. They won’t be getting any minutes,” he had said in Sept. With the U-17s, Bibiano Fernandes also made headlines by helping the boys cross the Asian Cup qualification hurdles.Repeating himself, Moosa confirmed his apprehensions in Dec. “Nothing is happening. The players too are sadly cooling their heels.” And we couldn’t but recall the days not too long ago, when the AIFF had to put a cap of 45 matches on the national team players.One may point out that these are silver linings. If so, then why can’t Manolo or Jamil do without Sunil Chhetri , India’s weather-beaten warhorse who is past 40? The striker had to break his retirement vows and don the India shirt again, confirming that Indian football’s cupboard is starkly bare.The year 2025 will stay in memory as the lowest point in Indian football.LEAGUE UNCERTAINTY: It’s the end of December, half-time in most football seasons, a time when clubs redraw their strategies, depending on the progress they’ve made in the league. This year, nothing. Indian football has never seen anything like this. There’s no word on the top tier ISL or the I-League, because the AIFF has simply failed to find a commercial partner. Everything’s at a standstill: clubs have paused first team operations, players have stopped training and many foreigners plan to move elsewhere once the transfer window opens on Jan 1. One club has told players they will have to “forego salaries” for months and they’d be “happy to resume payments” only from the date of restart.CAMPS WITHOUT PLAYERS: National team camps often kicked off without half the players. Coach Khalid Jamil wanted more time with the boys, but clubs refused to release players outside the FIFA international windows. It was no different for U-23 assignments. The trust deficit between the two parties has grown so much that Mohun Bagan SG, who have the maximum players at national camps, even accused the federation of negligence over the handling of their captain Subhashish Bose.MONUMENTAL FAILURE: In the 15 months between May 2024 and August 2025, the national team had three coaches — Igor Stimac, Manolo Marquez, Khalid Jamil — none of whom could ensure that India makes it to the AFC Asian Cup, the country’s first failure since the tournament was expanded to accommodate 24 teams. In the final round of qualifiers, India were the highest-ranked side but finished at the bottom, unable to register a single win and in five matches, scoring just twice. The defeat to Bangladesh in Dhaka, the first in 22 years, rankled the most.THE BIG EXIT: The City Football Group’s exit from Mumbai City FC was probably the biggest reflection of the mess that is Indian football. CFG, the world’s leading private owner and operator of 13 clubs, including Manchester City, had joined hands with Mumbai City with much fanfare. Their decision to divest its shareholding in the club is a huge blow. The reason: “CFG made this decision following a comprehensive commercial review and in light of the ongoing uncertainty surrounding the future of the Indian Super League (ISL). ”BUT, A SILVER LINING: The women’s team provided joy in an otherwise grim state. The senior team defied the odds to defeat World Cuppers Thailand and qualify for the AFC Asian Cup. The U-17 and U-20 teams also left India with three continental competitions to play for in the opening months of 2026. At club level, East Bengal’s SAFF Club Championship triumph and a first group stage win in the AFC Women’s Champions League brought cheer.UNDER MANOLO MARQUEZUNDER KHALID JAMILIndia won Bronze Medal at CAFA Nations CupTOTAL MATCHES: 11India Won: 3India Lost: 5Drawn: 3Goals Scored: 8Goals Conceded: 12","Indian football has slipped into such a deep abyss.

Rayan Cherki steals the show as Manchester City edge Nottingham Forest to go top of the Premier League,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/top-stories/rayan-cherki-steals-the-show-as-manchester-city-edge-nottingham-forest-to-go-top-of-the-premier-league/articleshow/126206283.cms,"Manchester City's Rayan Cherki celebrates with Erling Haaland (Barrington Coombs/PA via AP)

Rayan Cherki delivered another decisive statement of his growing influence at Manchester City as his late strike secured a 2-1 Premier League win over Nottingham Forest and lifted Pep Guardiola’s side to the top of the table on Saturday.The France international was at the heart of everything City did well at the City Ground. After setting up Tijjani Reijnders for the opening goal early in the second half, Cherki returned in the closing stages to fire home the winner, capping a standout display that underlined his importance to City’s title push.City had to weather sustained pressure from Forest, who matched Guardiola’s men for large spells and were level soon after falling behind. Omari Hutchinson, scoring his first goal for the club, punished a rare City mistake to bring the home side back into the contest and briefly threaten another memorable result against the champions.Guardiola’s team eventually found a way through, extending their winning run to eight matches in all competitions and six straight league victories. The result moved City one point clear of Arsenal, although the Gunners could reclaim top spot later in the day with a home win over Brighton.Before kick-off, Forest paid tribute to club legend John Robertson, who passed away on Christmas Day at the age of 72. The former Scotland winger was a central figure in Forest’s back-to-back European Cup triumphs in 1979 and 1980, and his flair and end product were fondly remembered by the City Ground crowd.Cherki, who joined City from Lyon in the summer, appears to share that same blend of creativity and cutting edge. At just 22, he has quickly become a key figure in Guardiola’s side and, should City edge Arsenal to the title, his contribution is likely to be pivotal.Guardiola had set a stern tone over the festive period, warning his players against excess and making it clear that fitness standards would not be compromised. He even cancelled a planned rest day after last weekend’s win over West Ham. When asked about his squad’s condition, Guardiola joked that he was the only one who had put on weight.Despite that discipline, City looked flat before the break and Forest had the better chances. Morgan Gibbs-White went close after meeting a Callum Hudson-Odoi cross, while City struggled to impose themselves. Erling Haaland, who has 19 league goals by Christmas, the joint-most at this stage in Premier League history, was largely kept quiet.The visitors finally found their rhythm just after the interval. Cherki drifted inside and slipped a clever pass to Reijnders, who finished calmly from 12 yards for City’s first shot on target. Cherki then tested goalkeeper John Victor with a fierce effort moments later.Forest responded swiftly. Reijnders lost possession near his own area, allowing Gibbs-White to release Igor Jesus, whose cross was drilled home by Hutchinson from close range. With City wobbling, Neco Williams forced Gianluigi Donnarumma into a save before Nicolo Savona blazed over from the rebound.The decisive moment arrived in the 83rd minute.

Drake Maye’s wife Ann Michael: 5 facts you must know,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/drake-mayes-wife-ann-michael-5-facts-you-must-know/articleshow/126281191.cms,"Drake Maye’s wife Ann Michael (Instagram)

Childhood sweethearts who grew up together



She shares his competitive spirit



Leadership through her sorority role



Family ties run through Tar Heels football



Business driven with a heart for community







Drake Maye and his wife Ann Michael Maye stepped into the national spotlight together the moment the New England Patriots made their franchise-altering decision, and the story of Drake Maye wife Ann Michael Maye begins long before draft night. While fans focused on the quarterback’s arm strength and poise, those close to him saw something deeper. A steady personal life that never wavered as the pressure rose.As Drake moved from college stardom to the NFL stage, Ann Michael remained a constant presence. Their relationship matured quietly alongside his career. That foundation now follows them into married life, offering a glimpse into the woman who has grown with one of football’s most talked-about young quarterbacks.Ann Michael and Drake first met at age 12, forming a bond that survived school changes, athletic demands, and public attention. They dated through their years at William Amos Hough High School in Cornelius, North Carolina, and stayed together after Drake transferred to Myers Park High School in Charlotte. When his football path led him to the University of North Carolina, Ann Michael chose the same campus, keeping their relationship intact through every transition.Athletics played a major role in Ann Michael’s life long before she became linked to an NFL quarterback. In high school, she captained teams in softball, field hockey, and cheerleading. Her leadership extended beyond playing as she later coached an under-10 girls’ softball team in Chapel Hill, showing a passion for mentoring young athletes and giving back through sports.At UNC, Ann Michael joined Kappa Delta and took on serious responsibility as vice-president of finance. The role required her to oversee “all financial activities for the Beta Chi chapter of Kappa Delta Sorority.” She managed “monthly dues for more than 200 members” and handled budgets for major events, building real-world financial skills that went far beyond campus life.Football also connected the couple through family. Ann Michael’s brother, Tad Hudson, played quarterback at UNC during the same period Drake rose to stardom. In 2023, Tad found himself behind the team’s breakout starter, Drake Maye, who would soon become his brother-in-law. The overlap added a unique layer to their shared college experience.Ann Michael graduated from UNC in 2025 with a degree in business administration and now attends the Kenan Flagler Business School. Alongside her academic focus, she stayed involved in meaningful causes. She was an active member of Sources of Strength, a national suicide prevention program that sought to improve the mental health of students. As Drake begins his NFL career with a guaranteed $36,639,764 contract, Ann Michael brings both financial acumen and a grounded sense of purpose into their next chapter.Also Read: Drake Maye isn’t buying the hype as Patriots QB shrugs off Patriots’ “easy schedule”","Ann Michael and Drake Maye first met at age 12, forming a bond that survived school changes, athletic demands, and public attention.

Josh Allen’s injury timeline and practice status





Good news for Bills fans, quarterback Josh Allen is officially off the Week 18 injury report and is expected to play against the New York Jets on Sunday. Allen had been managing a foot injury that limited him in practice earlier this week, but team updates confirm he’s healthy enough to take the field for the regular-season finale. His return removes uncertainty for Buffalo’s offense and fantasy football lineups heading into the weekend.Allen first dealt with the foot issue earlier in the week, which led to limited participation in practice sessions. Despite the injury, the Bills were hopeful he would be able to play, and his performance in practice this week gave the coaching staff confidence.Head coach Sean McDermott confirmed Allen will be “good to go” for the matchup against the Jets, signaling that the quarterback is fully cleared for game action. This update comes just days after reports had listed Allen as questionable, creating a small window of uncertainty for fans and fantasy players alike.With Allen returning to full availability, the Bills’ offense is back to full strength for the final game of the regular season. His presence is crucial for Buffalo’s passing game, which relies heavily on his arm and mobility.The Jets defense will now face the same elite quarterback they saw throughout the season, meaning Buffalo can maintain its normal offensive game plan.Allen’s availability is a huge boost for fantasy owners. Previously, his questionable status forced lineup changes in many leagues, but now he can be started with confidence. His presence also helps stabilize the fantasy production of his top receiving options and gives running backs like James Cook added scoring opportunities through play-action passes and designed QB runs.With Week 18 around the corner, Allen’s cleared status confirms he will be under center for the Jets game. The Bills will monitor his health as usual, but there are no reported limitations. Fans and fantasy managers can now plan their lineups around a fully healthy Josh Allen, while the team focuses on finishing the regular season strong and preparing for the playoffs.Also read - Davante Adams injury update: Will the Rams WR play in Week 18 vs. Cardinals?",Buffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen is expected to play against the New York Jets on Sunday.

Drake Maye and wife Ann Michael’s combined net worth in 2025: Why the $1 Million figure doesn’t tell the whole story,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/drake-maye-and-wife-ann-michaels-combined-net-worth-in-2025-why-the-1-million-figure-doesnt-tell-the-whole-story/articleshow/126309376.cms,"Drake Maye’s $1 million net worth headline hides the guaranteed money, endorsements, and long-term stakes behind the Patriots QB’s finances.

Drake Maye’s NFL contract, guaranteed cash, and why net worth estimates lag reality

Ann Michael Maye’s career, NIL-era overlap, and the couple’s shared financial trajectory





Drake Maye entered the NFL with money already in his pocket and pressure already on his name. The New England Patriots made him the No. 3 overall pick in the 2024 NFL Draft, handed him a fully guaranteed rookie deal, and quietly set expectations that come with following Tom Brady in Foxborough.Public estimates say Maye’s net worth sits at around $1 million in 2025. That number is technically accurate. It is also deeply misleading without context. When you factor in guaranteed cash, endorsement income, NIL history, and his wife Ann Michael Maye’s independent career path, the financial picture looks far more layered than a single headline figure.Drake Maye signed a four-year, $36.6 million rookie contract with the New England Patriots after being selected third overall in 2024. The deal is fully guaranteed and includes a $23.47 million signing bonus, per Spotrac. That bonus was paid immediately, making Maye an NFL millionaire before he took a regular-season snap.His base salaries rise annually, starting at roughly $795,000 in 2024 and increasing each season through 2027. As of August 2025, Maye had earned approximately $24.26 million in career NFL income, almost all of it tied to that signing bonus.So why do most outlets still list his net worth around $1 million?Net worth calculations account for taxes, agent fees, escrow withholdings, and early-career expenses. They also lag real-time earnings. According to The Sporting News and TheSportsRush, Maye’s estimated net worth in 2025 reflects liquid assets, not guaranteed contract value still being paid out over time.That distinction matters. Maye is cash-rich by rookie standards, but his long-term wealth depends on career longevity, endorsements, and a second contract. Right now, his financial floor is unusually high for a first-round quarterback. His ceiling remains undefined.Drake Maye married Ann Michael Hudson on June 21, 2025, at the Grandfather Golf and Country Club in North Carolina. The two have known each other since middle school and attended William A. Hough High School and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.Ann Michael Maye graduated from UNC in May 2025 with a degree in Business Administration, concentrating in finance. Her professional background includes internships in business development and strategy, consulting experience with Deloitte Consulting, and roles with Bosch Power Tools and Piedmont Pennies. She also served as vice president of finance for the Beta Chi chapter of Kappa Delta and worked as an assistant softball coach in Chapel Hill.She is not a passive figure in Maye’s financial story. While she does not have publicly disclosed net worth figures, her education and early career experience place her on a separate professional track from her husband’s NFL earnings.The couple also made headlines for donating their wedding gifts and cash, reportedly valued at around $100,000, to local shelters in North Carolina, according to People. The move drew attention not because of the amount, but because it signaled how they intend to handle money early in Maye’s career.Drake Maye’s off-field income further complicates the picture. During college at North Carolina, he held NIL deals with brands including Nike, Lowe’s, ZOA Energy, and Mitchell Heating & Cooling. On3 valued his NIL profile at approximately $1.2 million. He also chose to share portions of that income with teammates, a detail widely reported during his UNC tenure.Since entering the NFL, Maye has added partnerships with companies such as Betterment and Procter & Gamble. In September 2024, he announced a collaboration with Betterment that also supported Folds of Honor Boston, funding seven scholarships in his grandfather’s name for the 2024-25 academic year. He has also worked with Best Buddies and donated $10,000 to Hurricane Helene relief efforts through The Salvation Army in November 2024.Those commitments do not inflate net worth estimates. They do, however, explain why Maye’s financial footprint looks smaller on paper than his earnings suggest.","Drake Maye entered the NFL with money already in his pocket and pressure already on his name.

Jason Kelce's timeline gives us hints

What does this mean for Travis Kelce?

Also Read:





As the Kansas City Chiefs' disastrous 2025 NFL season comes to an end, people are starting to focus less on what happened on the field and more on the future of one of the team's best players. Travis Kelce's retirement is one of the hottest stories in the game right now, and latest rumors suggest that his final choice may be similar to a plan that his family has used before.Kelce, who is now 36 years old, has been the core of the Chiefs' offense for 13 seasons. Even while he is still effective, the NFL's physical toll and Kansas City's unexpected exit from the playoffs have brought up questions about how much further he expects to play. Jeremy Fowler, a senior NFL writer for ESPN, recently said that Kelce may take a slow, careful approach to retirement, just like his older brother Jason did.When you look at Jason Kelce's career, the similarities are hard to miss. The former center for the Philadelphia Eagles kept saying he would come back for ""one more year"" before finally saying he was done in March 2024. Jason publicly recommitted to football every offseason for three years before finally leaving when he was completely ready.Fowler says that the same thing may happen to Travis Kelce. The younger Kelce has previously said that talks about retirement are going on behind the scenes, but he has also said that he plans to take his time before making anything official. Reports say that a final decision could be made in March, which is quite close to Jason's timeframe from prior years.The Kansas City Chiefs have had a tough season. After years of being the best, they couldn't make the playoffs this year. The campaign made Kelce think more about his legacy and what drives him. Even while he is still one of Patrick Mahomes' most trusted targets, the physical demands of the position and the grind of another full season are getting tougher to ignore.On the other hand, Kelce has a lot of alternatives off the field, unlike many athletes who are about to retire. His post-NFL career is well planned out, with a very popular podcast called ""New Heights,"" TV appearances, and business deals. His well-known relationship with Taylor Swift and the fact that they are getting married in 2026 have only added to the feeling that a big change is coming in his life.Kelce would not be jumping into the unknown if he were to leave because he is financially stable and knows how to use the media.There is no need to hurry right now. Travis Kelce, like his brother, seems to want to make a choice based on what he knows rather than what other people are saying. Whether that means one last season or a dignified farewell this winter, the signs point to his retirement being planned, well thought out, and very much on his own terms.","Travis Kelce has been a key member of the Kansas City Chiefs' offense for 13 seasons.

Stefon and Trevon Diggs’ combined net worth: How rich is the NFL brother duo who turned top-level play into millions of dollars?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/stefon-and-trevon-diggs-combined-net-worth-how-rich-is-the-nfl-brother-duo-who-turned-top-level-play-into-millions-of-dollars/articleshow/126307834.cms,"Stefon and Trevon Diggs net worth explained.Image via: Getty

How Stefon and Trevon Diggs built their wealth over the years



Also read





Stefon Diggs and Trevon Diggs are one of the NFL’s most successful brother duos, and their combined net worth is the result of hard work, timing, and big football contracts. As of 2025, their combined net worth is estimated to be around $55 million to $60 million, with the majority of that money coming straight from NFL salaries.Stefon Diggs makes up the larger share of that wealth. He entered the league in 2015 and worked his way into becoming one of the NFL’s top wide receivers. His biggest financial jump, however, came in 2022, when he signed a four-year, whopping $96 million contract extension that placed him among the highest-paid players at his position. Over his career, Stefon has earned well over $120 million in NFL salary across multiple contracts. As a result, his individual net worth now sits at roughly $40 million to $45 million. While he does have endorsement deals, they are not excessive or flashy. Most of his income still comes from football, which has always been his main focus.Trevon Diggs’ rise has been quicker but just as impressive. Drafted in 2020, he quickly became one of the league’s most dangerous cornerbacks. His ability to create turnovers and shut down receivers earned him a major contract extension in 2023.That deal was a five-year agreement worth up to $97 million, with more than $40 million guaranteed, making him one of the highest-paid defensive backs in the NFL.Because Trevon is still early in his career, not all of that money has been paid out yet. As of 2025, his net worth is approximately between $15 million and $18 million, and that number is expected to rise steadily as his contract continues. Like his brother, Trevon’s income comes mostly from football rather than endorsements, with only a few brand partnerships tied to sports and performance.Together, the Diggs brothers’ financial success tells a simple story. There was no overnight fame involved. They earned their money by doing their jobs well, earning trust and signing smart contracts at the right time. It is an example of how steady performance in the NFL can turn talent into long-term wealth.","Stefon Diggs and Trevon Diggs are one of the NFL’s most successful brother duos.

Lakers vs Grizzlies Game setup and recent history

What to watch in the matchup





against the Memphis Grizzlies on January 2, 2026. He is not listed on the official injury report, confirming his availability after missing the teams’ earlier meeting this season due to sciatica.The Lakers needed that confirmation. James remains the anchor of the roster, even at 41, and his presence matters more with several rotation players sidelined. With the Western Conference standings still tight, this game carries weight for both teams.LeBron James is fully cleared and expected to play his normal role. He scored 17 points in the loss to Detroit and showed no issues related to his earlier back concerns.In 15 games this season, James is averaging 20.3 points, 4.9 rebounds, and 6.5 assists. He is shooting 49.6 percent from the field and playing just under 33 minutes per night. The Lakers have managed his workload, but his influence on both ends remains clear.Los Angeles enters the night at 20-11 after a 128-106 home loss to the Detroit Pistons, a game played on LeBron James’ birthday. Memphis comes in at 15-18, looking to improve its road record and stay within reach of the playoff picture.This is the second meeting between the teams this season. The Lakers won the first matchup 117-112 in an NBA Cup game on Halloween, a contest James did not play. Friday’s game tips off at 10:30 p.m. ET at Crypto.com Arena.Memphis will rely on Ja Morant and Jaren Jackson Jr., but injuries have thinned the Grizzlies’ frontcourt. That could open space for James to attack inside and push the pace.Also read: Los Angeles Lakers vs Memphis Grizzlies regular season game: Full injury report, who's out, where to watch, and more (January 2, 2026) With Luka Doncic also available, the Lakers have multiple creators on the floor.

Devin Vassell’s adductor strain raises concern as Spurs prepare for extended absence

Devin Vassell’s absence leaves scoring void as Spurs reshuffle wing rotation





The San Antonio Spurs announced on Friday night that wing Devin Vassell will be out for some time due to a left adductor strain sustained during Monday night's 113-101 loss to the Cleveland Cavaliers.Vassell may miss more games due to a strained left adductor. The Spurs will probably look to Julian Champagnie or Dylan Harper to cover for their starting guard/forward, who is absent for the first time this season. Champagnie has a safer floor, but Harper gives a larger ceiling in category leagues.Before the game against the New York Knicks, San Antonio Spurs coach Mitch Johnson provided an injury report, stating that the wing shooter would miss more than this one game. Due to a left adductor strain, the San Antonio Spurs anticipate that Devin Vassell may miss many games.Vassell's adductor injury was confirmed by a recent MRI. The Spurs have not yet disclosed how long their 25-year-old wing will be sidelined by this ailment. When it's suitable, the team will give him status updates.Vassell was classified as out for San Antonio's New Year's Eve home game against the New York Knicks.Prior to the game, head coach Mitch Johnson stated that the Spurs would be without Vassell's wing defence and scoring for additional games.""Still waiting for some stuff to give us clarity on that, but it'll be more than a game or two,"" Johnson said.According to Jeff Garcia of KENS 5 San Antonio, Vassell will miss Wednesday's game against the Knicks because of a left adductor strain. Vassell appears to have suffered an adductor injury, although he left Monday's loss to Cleveland for unclear reasons before making a comeback in the fourth quarter.It wouldn't be surprising if Vassell missed additional time after Wednesday, considering how complex the problem is. The most likely candidate to enter the starting lineup is Julian Champagnie.Julian Champagnie would take Vassell's starting position, according to Johnson. Champagnie is the most qualified player to replace Vassell in terms of play style, and he is a better shooter than his 35% from three this season would suggest.Vassell has been performing well this year in a more simplified role, so it's a difficult break. With an average of 15 points per game and a 38% three-point shooting percentage, he effectively spreads the floor around Victor Wembanyama and San Antonio's three rim-running lead guards.Vassell shot 42.2 percent from the field and 37.9 percent from three-point range, averaging 15.0 points, 4.0 rebounds, and 2.4 assists per game over 32 games. As of January 2, he is one of 24 NBA players who have made at least 85 threes this season, and he presently leads the team in threes made (85).Vassell had not missed any games this season before sustaining this injury on Monday and missing Wednesday night's game against the New York Knicks, when the Spurs avenged their NBA Cup loss with a 134-132 triumph.The Spurs will rely on Julian Champagnie and Keldon Johnson on the wing in the absence of Vassell. Johnson has occasionally been a potent scoring option off the bench in San Antonio, and Champagnie is presently second on the club in made threes this season.Also read: NBA injury update: Is Damian Lillard playing tonight vs Oklahoma City Thunder?

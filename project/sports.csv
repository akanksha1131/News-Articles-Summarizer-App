India batter Tilak Varma has been ruled out of the first three T20Is against New Zealand following abdominal surgery in Rajkot, the Board of Control for Cricket in India confirmed on Thursday.The 23-year-old underwent emergency surgery at a super-speciality hospital on Wednesday evening after experiencing acute abdominal pain earlier in the day. Medical scans indicated the immediate need for the procedure, prompting doctors to operate without delay.Providing an update on the situation, BCCI secretary Devajit Saikia said Varma is recovering well after the surgery. “He was discharged from the hospital on Thursday morning and is scheduled to fly back to Hyderabad on Friday. He is currently stable and progressing well,” Saikia said in an official statement.The board also outlined the roadmap for Varma’s return to cricketing activity. “Tilak will resume physical training and gradually return to skill-based activities once his symptoms have fully resolved and wound healing is satisfactory. He is ruled out of the first three T20Is against New Zealand. His availability for the remaining two matches will be assessed based on his progress during the return-to-training and skill phases,” the statement added.The recovery timeline has also cast doubt over Varma’s availability for India’s T20 World Cup opener against the United States of America at the Wankhede Stadium on February 7. India are scheduled to play further group matches against Namibia on February 12, Pakistan on February 15, and the Netherlands on February 18.Varma has been a vital presence in India’s T20I setup, scoring 1,183 runs in 37 innings at an impressive average of 49.29 and a strike rate of 144.09, including two centuries and six half-centuries. The absence could force captain Suryakumar Yadav to move up to the No. 3 position in the batting order.India are yet to name a replacement for the first three T20Is against New Zealand, which will be played in Nagpur, Raipur, and Guwahati on January 21, 23, and 25 respectively. The final two matches of the five-game series are scheduled for Visakhapatnam and Thiruvananthapuram on January 28 and 31.","Tilak Varma has been ruled out of the first three T20Is against New Zealand following abdominal surgery in Rajkot.

Robin Uthappa on SA20’s rise and why ICC shouldn’t host multi-nation tournaments every year

TimesofIndia.com in Durban: At a time when off-field matters are taking centre stage a month before the men's T20 World Cup gets underway, former India cricketer Robin Uthappa has diverted attention back to the game. On the sidelines of his commentary stint at the ongoing SA20, Uthappa questioned the need to host an ICC tournament every year and asserted the novelty of the multi-nation events is wearing off.“I think the game needs to evolve from the administrative perspective. How much value do fans and audiences hold for an ICC tournament every year? The novelty of it is wearing off, to be very honest and with all due respect,"" Uthappa said.ODI World Cup in 2023, T20 World Cup in 2024, Champions Trophy in 2025 and now back to the T20 World Cup, which gets underway on February 7. There has been a men's multi-nation event every year, and Uthappa felt there is a need to revisit the scheduling to ensure ""novelty"" of the tournaments remains intact.“I think the novelty of the ICC Championships must be there. It’s an integral part, not just for the players but also for the fans, also for the viewers. It has to mean something. There has to be a little bit of a gap. We can’t have or shouldn’t have an ICC championship every year. That is the hard truth that I think the administrators have to look at and face and look at evolving the game in a way where it’s actually moving towards,"" he added.Uthappa is on commentary duties for the ongoing fourth edition of the SA20, and a visit to Durban for the contest between Durban's Super Giants and Pretoria Capitals brought back memories of the 2007 T20 World Cup bowl out vs Pakistan.“Durbin brings back a lot of memories. I go back to 2007 all the time. Every time I come here, I look at that dressing room on the other side and I just think of all the wonderful things that, you know, we created here, the wonderful memories we created here. It was. It was a special time,"" Uthappa said.The former India batter was one of the players who participated in the bowl out, and comfortably hit the target. India ended up winning the tie-breaker and also the group stage fixture vs arch-rivals Pakistan.“I was on the pitch today just having a look before the pitch report and obviously reminiscing about the time when I actually bowled there. It was certainly a lot of fun. We did a lot of preparation for it, which we don’t really kind of talk about, but I think we were better prepared than the opposition team on that night,"" he recalled.","Robin Uthappa is on commentary duties for the ongoing fourth edition of the SA20.

Usman Khawaja's retirement speech: 'I want the journey for the next Usman Khawaja to be easier'

Poll Should England consider changing their strategy after this series? Yes, completely overhaul it No, just fine-tune their approach





Australia completed a commanding 4–1 Ashes series victory on Thursday, clinching the fifth and final Test against England by five wickets to cap a gruelling contest and send retiring opener Usman Khawaja into the sunset on a winning note.Chasing a modest target of 160 on day five, Australia were made to sweat as England struck five times before lunch. But Cameron Green (22 not out) and Alex Carey (16 not out) calmly steered the hosts home shortly after the break, extinguishing any lingering hopes of a dramatic finish.The chase began with early intent before wobbling. Travis Head struck a brisk 29 and Jake Weatherald made 34, but both fell as England clawed their way back. Captain Steve Smith was dismissed for 12, while Khawaja, playing the final innings of his 88-Test career, managed just six before being bowled by Josh Tongue after receiving a guard of honour from England’s players.Marnus Labuschagne looked set to settle nerves after being dropped on 20, compiling 37 before a needless run-out briefly lifted English spirits as Australia slipped to 121 for five. It proved only a momentary scare.England’s slim chance had been fashioned earlier through Jacob Bethell’s superb 154, the centrepiece of their second-innings 342. The stylish left-hander batted for 265 balls, striking 15 fours, and was hailed as a glimpse into England’s future even in defeat. Mitchell Starc eventually ended his resistance, with Tongue the last man out as England added only 40 runs to their overnight total.The loss rounded off a punishing tour for Ben Stokes’s side, which unravelled early with heavy defeats in Perth, Brisbane and Adelaide. A stirring comeback win in Melbourne — England’s first Test victory in Australia in 18 matches — briefly revived belief, but another defeat in Sydney leaves searching questions awaiting them back home amid scrutiny of their “Bazball” approach.Australia’s dominance was all the more impressive given their depleted attack, missing Josh Hazlewood for the entire series and Pat Cummins for all but one Test, while Nathan Lyon played a limited role. Starc finished as the leading wicket-taker with 31 scalps.Off the field, the series was a resounding success, drawing nearly 860,000 fans, including a record 211,032 in Sydney. On it, Australia underlined their supremacy — and gave Khawaja the perfect farewell, finishing his career exactly as he began the series: on the winning side of the Ashes.",Australia complete a commanding 4–1 Ashes series victory on Thursday.

NEW DELHI: England’s heavy 4-1 Ashes defeat has sparked strong criticism, and one of the loudest voices has been that of former England opener Geoffrey Boycott. The 85-year-old, who once won the Ashes in Australia himself, did not hold back while analysing England’s recent approach to Test cricket.In his column for the Daily Telegraph, Boycott directly targeted England’s leadership group, writing, "" Brendon McCullum , Rob Key, and Ben Stokes sold a lie for three years.""According to Boycott, England’s current philosophy has encouraged players to bat and bowl without fear but without responsibility.""McCullum's philosophy is do your own thing. Play without a care in the world. Express yourselves and if you get out, no problem, it's not your fault,"" he added.""Nobody tells them off, there is no accountability, and nobody gets dropped so they just keep doing the same daft things.""England went to Australia believing their fast bowlers could trouble the hosts.But injuries and selection issues meant that part-time off-spinner Will Jacks ended up playing as many Tests as quicks Mark Wood and Jofra Archer combined.Meanwhile, young spinner Shoaib Bashir, who had been prepared for the Ashes, did not play a single match.The series also highlighted both the positives and negatives of England’s attacking style. Jacob Bethell’s brilliant century in Sydney stood out. It was his first hundred in first-class cricket and showed his talent clearly. However, Bethell’s development had earlier been slowed because he was often rested during the 2025 domestic season.Despite limited chances, the 22-year-old showed maturity beyond his years with a superb 154 in Sydney.Former Australia opener Justin Langer praised the innings, saying, ""That is entertainment. Not running down and hitting it up in the air and saying, 'That's how we play.'""When McCullum and Stokes took charge in 2022, England enjoyed early success, winning 10 of their first 11 Tests. But results have dipped since.England have now lost 14 of their last 28 Tests and have not beaten Australia or India in a major series since 2018.","Geoffrey Boycott criticises England's leadership group.

New Zealand ODI squad:

The India vs New Zealand ODI rivalry is set to return once again as the two sides meet in a three match series starting Sunday, January 11 in Vadodara. The second ODI will be played on January 14 in Rajkot, with the series concluding on January 18 in Indore. Played in Indian conditions, the series brings back a rivalry shaped by fine margins, memorable performances and changing momentum across generations.India and New Zealand first faced each other in ODI cricket in 1975 and have since met 120 times in the format. India hold a slender advantage with 62 wins, while New Zealand have claimed victory in 50 matches. Seven games ended with no result, a reminder of how competitive this rivalry has been over the years.The legendary Sachin Tendulkar remains the most prolific batter in this rivalry. Across 42 ODIs, he scored 1,750 runs at an average of 46.05, with five centuries against New Zealand’s bowling. Virat Kohli follows closely and boasts one of his strongest bilateral records against New Zealand, averaging above 55 with six centuries. For New Zealand, Ross Taylor and Kane Williamson have been pillars of consistency, while Nathan Astle was a major force during the late 1990s and early 2000s.Javagal Srinath tops the wicket charts in this rivalry with 51 scalps, using pace and movement to trouble New Zealand batters across conditions. Anil Kumble sits second on the list with 39 wickets, while Mohammed Shami’s impact in recent years has stood out for its intensity and strike rate, highlighted by his memorable seven wicket haul in the 2023 World Cup semi final. For New Zealand, Tim Southee has been their most successful bowler against India in ODIsThe rivalry has produced dramatic extremes over the years. India’s highest ODI total against New Zealand came in the 2023 World Cup semi final in Mumbai, when they piled up 397 for 4. New Zealand’s highest score against India dates back to 1999, when they posted 349 for 9 in Rajkot.At the other end of the spectrum, New Zealand were bowled out for just 79 in Visakhapatnam in 2016, a match that also marked India’s biggest victory in the rivalry, a dominant 190 run win. India’s lowest total against New Zealand came when they were bundled out for 88, while New Zealand’s biggest victory over India arrived in 2010 with a crushing 200 run win in Dambulla.The rivalry has also delivered nail biting finishes, none more memorable than India’s narrow one run victory in Wellington in 1990, a match that remains etched in the history of contests between the two sides.Bilateral history adds further layers. India first toured New Zealand in February 1976 and lost a two match ODI series 2-0. A similar result followed in 1981. The balance shifted in 1989 when New Zealand toured India for a five match ODI series that India won 4-0.In recent years, New Zealand have enjoyed success at home, winning 3-0 in 2020 and clinching a rain affected series 1-0 in 2022. India responded emphatically in 2023 with a dominant 3-0 home series win.Shubman Gill (C), Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli, KL Rahul (WK), Shreyas Iyer (VC)*, Washington Sundar, Ravindra Jadeja, Mohd Siraj, Harshit Rana, Prasidh Krishna, Kuldeep Yadav, Rishabh Pant (WK), Nitish Kumar Reddy, Arshdeep Singh, Yashasvi JaiswalMichael Bracewell (c), Adi Ashok, Kristian Clarke, Josh Clarkson, Devon Conway, Zak Foulkes, Mitch Hay (wk), Kyle Jamieson, Nick Kelly, Jayden Lennox, Daryl Mitchell, Henry Nicholls, Glenn Phillips, Michael Rae, Will Young","India and New Zealand first met in ODI cricket in 1975 and have since met 120 times in the format.

New Delhi:

Robin Uthappa on SA20’s rise and why ICC shouldn’t host multi-nation tournaments every year

Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel.

Poll Do you agree with JP Duminy's assessment of Ottneil Baartman's character after being left out of the T20 World Cup squad? Yes, it shows great resilience. No, the selection should be unbiased. Unsure, need more context.

The noise around for Ottneil Baartman’s omission from South Africa’s T20 World Cup squad are growing louder. A couple of days after Dale Steyn questioned Baartman’s exclusion from the Aiden Markram-led side, his former teammate JP Duminy has shared his opinion on the ongoing debate around the speedster.Duminy believes Baartman’s response to being left out of the squad for the upcoming T20 World Cup says more about the fast bowler than any selection call ever could.“To come off the back of not getting selected and then put in the performances he has speaks volumes about his character,” JP Duminy said while addressing the media in a session facilitated by SA20. “He’s not letting the negativity around it affect his performances. Instead, he’s using motivation and encouragement to keep delivering.”“It’s always a tough one to make a late call like that,” he said. “The more important angle is preparing as if an opportunity might come, and being ready if it does.”Baartman, who part of the Paarl Royals, has taken 11 wickets from 4 matches and is the leading wicket-taker in the ongoing fourth edition of the SA20. Yet, he has missed the bus for the T20 World Cup to be played in India and Sri Lanka next month.Legendary Proteas fast bowler Dale Steyn, who was Baartman's bowling coach for the first three season of the SA20 at Sunrisers Eastern Cape, urged the selectors to have a second look.""He's the highest wicket taker in SA20, won the league twice and made a final, let me remind you, that's a comp that has 4 INTERNATIONAL players (often batters) plus all the PROTEAS! He's number 1,"" Steyn posted on X. ""Thats TOP quality, but he'll be sitting home for this years 20/20 WC.""Yet, despite those positives, Baartman’s absence remains a reminder of how fine the margins are at the top level. Duminy was careful not to speculate on the selectors’ reasoning, acknowledging that such decisions are rarely understood in full from the outside. “Yes, there will be disappointment and questions,” he said, “but the focus has to stay on what you can do right now for the team you’re playing for.”For Baartman, Duminy stressed, control is limited to effort and focus. “As a cricketer, you can only control what you put into your performances. What we’ve seen so far is that he’s done that exceptionally well, and with real consistency.”Duminy’s comments came at the halfway mark into the SA20 with the T20 World Cup on the horizon. He also highlighted the significance of form players peaking at the right time. The return to rhythm of Quinton de Kock (205 runs from 5 matches @68.33 with a strike rate of 173.73), he felt, was a major positive. An in-form de Kock, Duminy said, “boosts the morale and confidence of the South African public and, more importantly, the team. ”""If you put your Quinton de Kock hat on, obviously missing out on international cricket for a period of time and the competitor that he is, he certainly wants to getting the backing now from the selectors and the team, he certainly would want to perform in a way that warrants that selection,"" he said on De Kock.""And if you have an in-form De Kock, it always boosts the morale and the confidence of the South African public and more importantly, the South African team. So, long may it continue going into a very important T20 World Cup.""He was equally optimistic about the rise of Marco Jansen (4 wickets), describing the left-armer as a genuine all-round package in the making.Duminy noted that South Africa’s tradition of impactful all-rounders makes Jansen’s development particularly significant, especially in white-ball cricket, where balance and flexibility often define tournament success.","Duminy believes Baartman’s response to being left out of the squad for the upcoming T20 World Cup says more about the fast bowler than any selection call ever could. Duminy was careful not to speculate on the selectors’ reasoning, acknowledging that such decisions are rarely understood in full from the outside.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126417246,imgsize-45984,width-400,resizemode-4/ottneil-baartman.jpg"

Hyderabad’s bowlers were on top, using the pace and bounce of the pitch well.Captain CV Milind and Mohammed Siraj led the attack and picked up two wickets each. Their short-ball plan worked, and J&K kept losing wickets at regular intervals.That is when Auqib Nabi stepped up.

Poll How confident are you about Tilak Varma's recovery in time for the T20 World Cup? Very Confident Somewhat Confident Not Confident Unsure

Team India batter Tilak Varma is all set to resume physical training in seven to ten days, his childhood coach Salam Bayash has confirmed.“It is a minor injury. There is nothing serious about it and he will not miss the T20 World Cup,” Bayash told TimesofIndia.com.Tilak underwent testicular torsion surgery in Rajkot on Wednesday. The 23-year-old was rushed to hospital after complaining of acute abdominal pain in Rajkot, where he was with the Hyderabad team for the ongoing Vijay Hazare Trophy.“He will resume his training in seven to ten days,” the coach said.BCCI on Thursday evening had confirmed that the batter will miss the first three-match against New Zealand.""Tilak Varma was discharged from the hospital on Thursday morning and is scheduled to fly back to Hyderabad on Friday. He is currently stable and progressing well,"" BCCI said in a statement.""Tilak will resume physical training and gradually return to skill-based activities once his symptoms have fully resolved and wound healing is satisfactory.""He is ruled out of the first three T20Is against New Zealand. His availability for the remaining two matches will be assessed based on his progress during the return-to-training and skill phases.""Tilak also took to Instagram to share an update on his recovery.“Thank you for all the overwhelming love. Already on the road to recovery and I’ll be back on the field sooner than you know it,” Tilak wrote on his Instagram story.Tilak has been a regular fixture in India’s T20I setup over the past six months, featuring in all three of their most recent assignments: the Asia Cup in September, the home T20Is against Australia in October, and the South Africa tour in December. Across 18 innings last year, he scored 567 runs at an average of 47.25 and a strike rate of 129.15.Tilak was India’s hero in the Asia Cup final, and captain Suryakumar Yadav had confirmed that the 23-year-old will be India’s designated No. 3 in the upcoming T20I series and the T20 World Cup.“We have come to a point where I, Gauti bhai (head coach Gautam Gambhir), and others feel that a left-right combination is not always required. Yesterday in Ahmedabad we saw Hardik bat brilliantly against left-arm spin, so that is slightly overrated,” Suryakumar had told reporters shortly after India’s squad for the T20 World Cup and the T20I series against New Zealand was announced.“Now we seem to have settled on Tilak being comfortable at No. 3, and I will play at No. 4. Five and six will depend on the situation, Hardik or (Shivam) Dube, but Tilak is comfortable in that position.”TimesofIndia.com also understands that it is very unlikely India will announce any replacements, with the selectors not naming any standbys for the World Cup.“There are no standbys since the whole tournament is happening in the country and we can replace any player at any point in time,” BCCI secretary Devajit Saikia had said.",Tilak Varma is set to resume physical training in seven to ten days.

New Delhi: Bengaluru FC owner Parth Jindal on Wednesday called on the players to ""make sacrifices"" in view of the ""financial burden"" the club will shoulder to participate in the delayed Indian Super League (ISL) next month, saying without their support, the club may have to ""shut shop for good"".All India Football Federation's (AIFF) bid to rope in a new commercial partner did not find any takers after the Master Rights Agreement (MRA) with the ISL organisers, the Reliance-owned FSDL, ended on December 8 last year.Though Sports Minister Mansukh Mandaviya on Tuesday announced that the delayed and truncated 2025-26 ISL season will begin on February 14 with all the 14 clubs participating in it, the franchises will struggle financially if the top-tier tournament does not get a commercial partner soon.The AIFF is expected to float another tender soon for a commercial partner.Jindal did not specifically explain the kind of sacrifice the footballers will be expected to make, but it could well be a reduced salary for this season. The club features, among others, former India captain Sunil Chhetri and star goalkeeper Gurpreet Singh Sandhu.The ISL clubs are required to share 60 per cent of the financial cost (around Rs one crore per club) for the league to start after a nearly six months long pause.The total cost for the upcoming season has been pegged at Rs 25 crore by the AIFF.""Tremendous sacrifice from all clubs is being asked for to play the ISL in its current format. Repercussions if we don't have a league are very worrying,"" Jindal wrote on 'X'.""Truly hope the players understand the additional financial burden on the clubs and agree to also sacrifice as we are all in this together. We are in this for the love of football and to see our country play the beautiful game and be good at it.""He admitted that Bengaluru FC has been a loss-making franchise since joining the ISL and said the club may have to wind up its operations if players do not cooperate.""@bengalurufc football has been a loss making proposition for all since I can remember - this year's numbers without the players helping out will force many to shut shop for good,"" he said in the tweet which was reposted by FC Goa CEO Ravi Puskur.Jindal also thanked Mandaviya ""for his intervention and his proposal"", which led to the ending of a crisis that paralysed Indian football.Earlier on Friday, leading names such as Sunil Chhetri, along with several foreign recruits of the ISL, had called for world governing body FIFA's intervention to rescue the ISL.Chhetri, Gurpreet Singh Sandhu and Sandhesh Jhingan voiced concern over the prolonged uncertainty, warning that Indian football would be slipping into a state of ""permanent paralysis"".On Tuesday, Mandaviya announced that the ISL will have 91 matches on home and away basis, the logistics of which are still being worked out.AIFF President Kalyan Chaubey, who took over the explaining part after the Minister's announcement, said a Rs 25 crore central pool has been made for only the conduct of the ISL.""Ten percent of this fund will come from AIFF, 30 percent was to come from a commercial partner but since we don't have one right now, the AIFF will pitch in with that contribution,"" Chaubey had said.""In all, the AIFF will give Rs 14 crore for ISL and about Rs 3.2 crore for I League till we find a commercial partner.

Jay Shah’s 2036 Olympic blueprint for India: '8 Medals won’t cut it'

Poll Do you agree with the decision to change the ISL format to a single leg home and away structure? Yes, it's a good change. No, I preferred the previous format. Undecided.

PANAJI: The sports ministry and the All India Football Federation (AIFF) turned the tables on top-tier clubs during a joint meeting in the Capital on Tuesday, leaving them with no choice but agree to take part in this edition of the Indian Super League (ISL).Sports minister Mansukh Mandaviya later announced that the ISL will kick off on Feb 14 with all 14 teams taking part. When clubs headed to the Capital at short notice — summoned individually through a phone call late on Monday night by AIFF deputy secretary general M Satyanarayan — they were expecting to hear the proposal, return home, study and then consult owners. Instead, they were told time was running out and they had to say “yes or no” on Tuesday itself.“We had no choice to decide whether the (short-term) proposal makes sense,” said one club official who had to hurriedly call the club owner and inform him of the latest developments.Consistent in their stand that they are taking part in the top league, whatever the format and financial implications, Jamshedpur FC were the first to provide an email confirmation, followed by the likes of Punjab FC, East Bengal, NorthEast United, Mohammedan Sporting and Inter Kashi.Later, Delhi SC, Bengaluru FC and Mohun Bagan Super Giant came on board. Five clubs — Kerala Blasters, Chennaiyin FC, Mumbai City, FC Goa and Odisha FC — needed time to speak with their owners and reluctantly agreed. ISL clubs were also taken aback with the change in format.While most were in favour of a single-leg centralised format, AIFF proposed a single leg home and away structure for the current season, estimated to cost Rs24.3 crore. AIFF said a single leg centralised format will cost Rs 38 crore, adding to the cost.The ISL will have a total of 91 matches with all 14 teams playing each other once. Clubs have to pay Rs 1 crore each as franchise fee. As per the constitution, the top league will have principles of promotion and relegation, but AIFF is likely to approach the Supreme Court for a one-year relaxation, given that it will be a truncated league. Talking to the media, sports minister Mansukh Mandaviya said: “Today the govt, football federation and 14 clubs had a meeting and we have decided that ISL will start Feb 14 on Saturday. All 14 clubs will participate.”“Similarly, the I-League will be held around the same time with all 11 clubs participating. The leagues will finally happen,” he added.Mandaviya was joined by the beleaguered AIFF president Kalyan Chaubey, who explained the financial and logistical aspects of both leagues. “A Rs 25 crore central pool has been made only for the conduct of the ISL. 10 percent of this fund will come from AIFF, 50% from clubs and 10% from legacy partners (clubs). Another 30% was to come from a commercial partner but since we don’t have one right now, the AIFF will pitch in with that contribution for this season,” Chaubey said.","Sports minister Mansukh Mandaviya announced that the ISL will kick off on Feb 14 with all 14 teams taking part.

Usman Khawaja's retirement speech: 'I want the journey for the next Usman Khawaja to be easier'

- Full-time job? -

LONDON: Manchester United interim boss Darren Fletcher said Tuesday that leading the club was beyond his ""wildest dreams"" but insisted he has not considered replacing the sacked Ruben Amorim. The Portuguese manager was axed on Monday after a turbulent 14 months at Old Trafford, with former United midfielder Fletcher put in temporary charge.The under-18s coach faced the press for the first time on the eve of his team's match at Burnley.""It's surreal,"" said Fletcher, who made 342 appearances for the Red Devils and has worked in a variety of different roles for them since 2020, including as technical director.""It's an amazing honour to be able to lead a Manchester United team,"" he said. ""I don't even think it was in my wildest dreams that that was something that could potentially happen, even thinking about playing for the club and stuff like that.""But to lead out the team is an amazing honour and something I am really proud to do.""It's not (happened) in the circumstances that I expected it to happen so that obviously is something that doesn't sit quite easy with me, but I just have to think I've got a job to do and I've got to lead the team tomorrow and think of the great honour and pride in doing that.""The former Scotland international is expected to remain in place until the club appoints a caretaker boss, with United planning to name Amorim's permanent successor at the end of the season.The BBC reported that the club had held preliminary talks with Fletcher, Michael Carrick and former boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, all ex-United players, about the position of caretaker.But Fletcher, 41, said at his pre-match press conference that conversations with United's hierarchy had focused on Wednesday's game and they would talk again after the match.Fletcher was asked whether he wanted to try to earn the manager's job on a full-time basis.""Honestly it's not something I've thought about,"" he said. ""I'm focusing on Burnley. I think that discussion is for after the game.""There has been that much going on and it has all happened so quickly that all my concentration, efforts and thoughts have gone into Burnley.""Fletcher won five Premier League titles under the management of Alex Ferguson but the club have not been English champions since 2013.""Everyone expects Manchester United to be on the top and winning, that's the standard, that's what we all have to try and achieve,"" said a bullish Fletcher.He was asked what his United team would look like.""Hopefully it looks like a Manchester United team that represents a bit of me, I think in terms of what I know is Manchester United,"" he said.""So I hope it resembles a Manchester United team that fans can be proud of, that I can be proud of, and I'm sure they will because I believe in the players.""I think we've got good players and I think we've got players who care and I think we've got a lot of quality in that team and I hope to give them a platform to go out there to express themselves.""Fletcher said he hoped to welcome back captain Bruno Fernandes and Mason Mount into a squad badly depleted by injuries and international commitments.He joked that he refused to disclose sensitive information when asked whether his twin sons, Jack and Tyler, would be given full debuts against Burnley.United are sixth in the Premier League table, three points behind fourth-placed Liverpool.","Darren Fletcher says leading Manchester United is beyond his ""wildest dreams"" Fletcher says he has not considered replacing the sacked Ruben Amorim.

"Liam Rosenior becomes Chelsea's second Black manager, signs until 2032",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/top-stories/liam-rosenior-becomes-chelseas-second-black-manager-signs-until-2032/articleshow/126373285.cms,"Liam Rosenior (Photo by Justin Setterfield/Getty Images)

Chelsea have confirmed Liam Rosenior as their new manager, signing the 41-year-old on a six-year contract until 2032 after he left French side Strasbourg on Tuesday. Rosenior, known for his attack-minded approach, becomes only the second Black manager in Chelsea’s history, following Ruud Gullit.Rosenior earned praise for transforming Strasbourg into a competitive Ligue 1 side, guiding them to a seventh-place finish last season and European qualification. “Liam has shown that he can build teams with a clear way of playing while setting the highest standards with players on and off the pitch. While there will continue to be a focus on player development, the club’s expectations and ambitions remain high,” Chelsea said in their announcement.Before Strasbourg, Rosenior had a stint as assistant coach at Derby under Wayne Rooney, who commended his “incredible” work ethic and attention to detail. Despite his success in France, Rosenior has never managed a Premier League side. He succeeds Enzo Maresca, who left after 18 months at the helm.Chelsea, currently fifth in the league and 17 points behind leaders Arsenal, offer Rosenior a higher-profile and more pressurised stage.Reflecting on the opportunity, Rosenior said: “I am excited to work with this extremely talented group of players and staff, to build strong connections on and off the pitch, and to create an environment where everyone feels united and driven by the same goal.”The move also carries personal significance. Rosenior added: “This opportunity for me is something I can’t turn down at this moment in my life… It means that I can go home and see my kids. I’m away from my children, I missed them. And I wanted to make the sacrifice of not seeing them worth it, with the success that we have here.”Son of former player and coach Leroy Rosenior, Liam had a 16-year professional playing career in England, representing Fulham, Reading, Hull, Brighton, and England Under-21s. He returned to Hull as his first head coach in 2022 before joining Strasbourg in 2024, leaving the French club with European football secured and a spot in the knockout phase of the UEFA Conference League.Rosenior defended his decision to move to Chelsea, stating: “I don’t think anyone can question how hard I’ve worked for the club, my integrity in the way I’ve worked for this club. I don’t think anyone can question the decision I’ve made to move on with my career.”This appointment marks a rare top-level opportunity for a Black British coach in the Premier League, and Chelsea will hope Rosenior can bring stability and consistency to a side that has seen five permanent managers since the BlueCo takeover in 2022.","Chelsea confirm Liam Rosenior as their new manager.

MANCHESTER: Ruben Amorim's sacking by Manchester United has exposed the dismal lack of progress since Jim Ratcliffe's arrival as co-owner promised a new dawn.Amorim was the latest manager unable to turn the tide at Old Trafford, which has witnessed more than a decade of decline since Alex Ferguson retired in 2013.The veteran Scot stood down after winning the club's 20th English league crown following two decades of domestic dominance gilded by European success.Since then United have not seriously competed to win the Premier League or Champions League despite a succession of big-name managers.Amorim, 40, is the first boss to be hired and axed since Ratcliffe took control of the club's football operations after acquiring a minority stake in the Red Devils.The British billionaire's arrival in February 2024 was greeted with glee by supporters desperate to see a new face at the helm after years of underachievement under the Glazer family, who still own a majority stake.Yet hopes that the boyhood United fan could make United competitive again at home and in Europe have so far been dashed.- No 'knee-jerk reactions' -Just a few months ago, Ratcliffe, 73, said Amorim had three years to prove himself despite a tough start at United, adding that the club would not be drawn into ""knee-jerk reactions"".But United have continued to drift, winning just one of their past five home games in the league.An apparent rift with the club's director of football Jason Wilcox over tactics and transfer targets appears to have increased the pressure on Amorim, who was dismissed on Monday after 14 months in charge.Wilcox moved into his current position in June last year, taking over the main role held by Dan Ashworth, who lasted just five months at the club in an early embarrassment for the new regime.Ratcliffe has so far done little to suggest he can deliver on his desire to restore a club he admitted ""has become mediocre"" to former glories.The club's ambition to win a 21st league title by the time of their 150th anniversary in 2028 looks less realistic with every passing season.United finished the 2024/25 campaign in 15th spot -- the club's lowest top-flight finish since they were relegated in 1974 -- and missed out on European football for only the second time in 35 years.Despite a marginal improvement this season, Amorim departed with his side 17 points adrift of leaders Arsenal after 20 games.The club are still within striking distance of the top four but cannot afford to lose further ground.- Transfer flops -Ratcliffe has been publicly scathing of some of United's transfer dealings prior to his arrival but the jury is still out on incomings on his watch.Joshua Zirkzee and Manuel Ugarte have largely been peripheral figures since being signed under the managerial regime of Erik ten Hag, Amorim's predecessor.Amorim was armed with an expensive new front three of Benjamin Sesko, Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo in the recent summer transfer window but they have scored just 12 Premier League goals between them so far.United's ability to spend their way out of their troubles is beginning to be squeezed by financial sustainability rules.The club's desperate need to return to the lucrative Champions League will have been a factor in their decision to axe Amorim, who arrived in November 2024 feted as one of the game's leading young managerial talents.To compound matters for United fans starved of success, Ratcliffe is asking them to pay more to attend games.At the same time, he has been criticised for swingeing job cuts as he tries to restore order to the club's finances.Last year United set out plans for a 100,000-seater stadium to replace their historic but creaking Old Trafford ground.Ratcliffe said the club planned to have the ""world's greatest football stadium"", with hopes it could be finished within five years, though there is major uncertainty over the timescale.Plans on and off the pitch are undoubtedly ambitious, but they are a long way from being realised.",Amorim is the first boss to be hired and axed since Jim Ratcliffe took control of the club's football operations.

No more 3-4-3 as Manchester United sack head coach Ruben Amorim after Leeds draw; here's why,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/top-stories/no-more-3-4-3-manchester-united-sack-head-coach-ruben-amorim-heres-why/articleshow/126351096.cms,"Ruben Amorim





Manchester United on Monday sacked head coach Ruben Amorim, hours after the Portuguese spoke about tensions within the club following Sunday’s 1-1 draw against Leeds United. Amorim had said the club hierarchy needed to ""do their job"" and that he should be allowed to work without interference.The 1-1 draw at Elland Road was Amorim’s final match of his 14-month spell in charge. The result left Manchester United sixth in the Premier League after 20 matches.“With Manchester United sitting sixth in the Premier League, the club’s leadership has reluctantly made the decision that it is the right time to make a change,” United said in a statement. “This will give the team the best opportunity of the highest possible Premier League finish.”Former midfielder and current Under-18s coach Darren Fletcher is expected to take charge on an interim basis. His first match is likely to be away at Burnley on Wednesday night. The club is expected to make a permanent appointment in the summer.Reports had claimed that United’s head of recruitment, Christopher Vivell, asked Amorim to adapt his tactics after Fulham manager Marco Silva explained how his team planned to counter United’s system during their draw in August.Amorim changed his usual three-man defence for the win over Newcastle but returned to his preferred system in draws against Wolves and Leeds.Amorim was appointed in November 2024 after Erik ten Hag was sacked. The decision to remove him was taken by the club’s leadership, including chief executive Omar Berrada and director of football Jason Wilcox, following a breakdown in relations.Under the terms of his contract, which runs until 2027 with an option for a further year, United will have to pay the full amount, as there is no clause for a reduced exit.After the Leeds match, Amorim said, ""It’s going to be like this for 18 months or when the board decide to change. That was my point, I want to finish with that. I’m not going to quit. I will do my job until another guy is coming here to replace me.""Amorim had faced criticism for sticking to a 3-4-3 formation. Before the Leeds game, he spoke about differences over the system and difficulties in signing players suited to it. He again used the 3-4-3 against Leeds.",Manchester United sack head coach Ruben Amorim. The Portuguese had spoken about tensions within the club.

Gonzalo Garcia bagged a hat-trick for Real Madrid as they beat Real Betis 5-1 on Sunday to stay on La Liga leaders Barcelona's tail. Spanish striker Garcia, filling in for the injured Kylian Mbappe, opened the scoring after 20 minutes and then volleyed home a superb second early in the second half to give Madrid a commanding lead.Raul Asencio further extended Xabi Alonso's side's advantage before Cucho Hernandez pulled one back for Manuel Pellegrini's visitors, sixth.Madrid youth academy product Garcia completed his hat-trick after 82 minutes with a clever flicked finish to delight fans at the Santiago Bernabeu, with Fran Garcia notching a late fifth.Madrid, second, cut Barca's lead back down to four points after the champions edged Espanyol 2-0 in a Catalan derby on Saturday.Atletico Madrid, fourth, were held 1-1 at Real Sociedad later on.Madrid's victory eased the pressure on Alonso, who scraped through to 2026 at the helm despite reports he was on the verge of being sacked after a run of inconsistent form.With top goalscorer Mbappe sidelined with a knee sprain, Alonso turned to 21-year-old forward Garcia to replace him, as he did during the Club World Cup last summer.Garcia's opportunities have been limited this season despite acquitting himself well in the United States and he proved himself again.""These were three very special goals, my first hat-trick here at the Bernabeu, my first goals this season as well,"" he told reporters, before admitting he still faces a fight for minutes.""In front of me I obviously have the best players in the world, like Mbappe, Rodrygo (Goes), (Jude) Bellingham, Vinicius,"" he continued.""I just focus on myself, which means working day by day and taking the opportunities the coach gives me, like today, and I hope I can deliver and help my teammates every minute I get.""Madrid started strongly and took a deserved lead through Garcia's looping header from Rodrygo's free-kick.Betis battled back into the game and were the more dangerous team in the remainder of the first half, although they could not test Madrid goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois.Madrid extended their lead early in the second half after an excellent finish from Garcia, who controlled Fede Valverde's long ball on his chest and volleyed home from the edge of the box.Asencio, who also came from Madrid's youth academy, nodded home Rodrygo's corner for Madrid's third before the hour mark in one of the more convincing performances under Alonso.With the points secured, Madrid relaxed and Betis created some danger, with Giovani Lo Celso and Rodrigo Riquelme hitting the woodwork and Hernandez rounding Courtois before drilling home.Garcia restored Madrid's three-goal advantage with a lovely flick from Arda Guler's cross, drawing applause from the watching Mbappe.Late on defender Fran Garcia, who played with Madrid at youth level before moving to Rayo Vallecano, fired home Valverde's cross to round off an emphatic victory.""It's a great stat, that the five goals were scored by academy players, it shows the great work being done there,"" said Alonso.""In Gonzalo's case, with his hat-trick, I'm very happy for him and the team, it was an important and deserved win.""Real Madrid next face rivals Atletico in the Spanish Super Cup semi-finals in Saudi Arabia on Thursday.Diego Simeone's side could only manage a draw at Real Sociedad, leaving them 11 points behind leaders Barcelona.Atletico pulled level with third-placed Villarreal on 38 points but have played two more matches than them and lost more ground in the Spanish title race.Alexander Sorloth headed Atletico ahead early in the second half but Goncalo Guedes levelled five minutes later to secure Real Sociedad's American coach Pellegrino Matarazzo a point in his first game at the helm.Simeone bemoaned big chances missed by Conor Gallagher and substitute Antoine Griezmann.""If we were sharper in the area we might have been able to cover up the discomfort that remains after this draw,"" said Simeone.It was an encouraging start for Matarazzo, with Real Sociedad having the better of Atletico for large periods.""There's a lot to like about the performance today, all the boys were connected, all 90 minutes of the game,"" said the New Jersey native.",Gonzalo Garcia scores a hat-trick as Real Madrid beat Real Betis 5-1.

“I’m just dating around”: Alix Earle gets newfound attention with viral past interview amidst dating rumors with Tom Brady,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/im-just-dating-around-alix-earle-gets-newfound-attention-with-viral-past-interview-amidst-dating-rumors-with-tom-brady/articleshow/126426084.cms,"Tom Brady and Alix Earle (via Getty Images)

Old interviews and new sightings add fuel to the speculation

Tom Brady has stayed in the public eye since retiring from the NFL with his sportscasting gig, and now his rumored romance with popular influencer Alix Earle. As fans got curious about her, past comments made by Earle about dating have now resurfaced after the two were spotted together during New Year’s Eve celebrations.A 2023 interview on Howard Stern featured Earl’s views on relationships, commitment, and age gaps. While neither Brady nor Earle has confirmed a relationship, the contrast between their lifestyles and her candid remarks has fueled widespread speculation. Earle emphasized that despite getting DMs from popular personalities, she likes to have fun in relationships and is not looking at anything serious.In the Howard Stern interview, she stated, “I’m just dating around, having fun,” she said at the time. “Nothing serious.” Earle also spoke freely about receiving messages from well-known figures, noting that some were older. When asked about their ages, she confirmed, “Some are older. 40s.” She later added that age alone was not a deal breaker, explaining, “I’m a personality person.”Her dating history shows a clear pattern of comfort with older partners. In 2022, Earle briefly dated MLB player Tyler Wade, who was six years older than her.Not long after, she entered a relationship with NFL wide receiver Braxton Berrios, who was five years her senior. That relationship ended earlier this year, shortly before she was seen spending time with Brady at a New Year’s Eve party.Earle has also spoken openly about significant age gaps in past relationships. On Jake Shane’s Therapuss podcast in April 2024, she recalled a college romance with a much older man. She recalled, “He was like 45 when I was 20” later adding, “Sometimes I love an old man.” These resurfacing remarks make sense, as reports stated that she and Brady were introduced through mutual friends and appeared comfortable together on the dance floor.For Brady, being linked to younger women is nothing new. Past rumors involving Sydney Sweeney were later dismissed, and he was previously reported to have dated Irina Shayk. As of now, the Brady and Earle dating rumors are driven largely by public sightings and social media buzz.Also read: Tom Brady and Alix Earle’s viral New Year’s Eve video sparked dating rumors, but the truth tells a different story","Alix Earle and Tom Brady were spotted together at a New Year's Eve party.

Mike McDaniel firing sparks Chiefs speculation and Tyreek Hill ’s blunt response



Mike McDaniel firing changed the mood in Miami faster than anyone expected. For weeks, league chatter painted stability, not upheaval, around the Dolphins. Then Thursday arrived with a jolt. ESPN’s Adam Schefter reported that Miami had decided to move on, ending a four-year chapter that once promised innovation and speed. The decision came after a private meeting between McDaniel and owner Stephen Ross, a moment that quietly reset the franchise’s direction.Ross followed the news with a public statement, explaining the Dolphins were “in need of comprehensive change.” The words carried weight. McDaniel, just 41, was never framed as a failure. He was framed as a coach whose ideas no longer aligned with the future Miami envisioned after a 7–10 season that stalled momentum.The Mike McDaniel firing instantly fed the NFL’s offseason imagination. Kansas City emerged as a popular landing spot in fan conversations, especially with offensive coordinator Matt Nagy drawing head coaching interest elsewhere. The theory was simple. Pair Andy Reid with another creative mind. Give Patrick Mahomes fresh fuel after a season cut short by injury.On paper, it sounded tempting.Then Tyreek Hill stepped in.“Mike don’t fit yall scheme buddy sorry to tell ya,” he tweeted on Thursday.Hill’s words mattered because they came from experience, not emotion. He thrived under McDaniel in Miami, posting back to back seasons with more than 1,700 receiving yards. He also knows Kansas City’s offense at its core, shaped by Mahomes’ instincts and Reid’s structure. His message was not an attack on McDaniel’s intelligence or creativity. It was about fit.McDaniel leaves Miami with a 35–33 record, including two playoff appearances that ended in first-round losses. His teams were fast, inventive, and at times electric. Yet consistency proved elusive. Late in his tenure, reports suggested tension with Hill, especially as injuries and expectations collided. Hill’s 2025 season ended early with a knee injury, closing a chapter that once looked unstoppable.For Kansas City, Hill’s perspective served as a reality check. Scheme compatibility often matters more than star power. McDaniel will not stay unemployed long. With multiple coaching vacancies across the league and a strong offensive résumé, interviews will come quickly. Still, the Dolphins’ decision and Hill’s reaction underline a truth the NFL relearns every winter. Great ideas alone are not enough. Timing, trust, and alignment decide what lasts.Also Read: John Harbaugh's future: 3 possible landing spots for former Ravens' coach",Mike McDaniel was fired by the Miami Dolphins on Thursday.

Ann Michael Maye Beyond Bakemas finds a new home on NBC Sports Boston



Ann Michael Maye's creativity meets regional sports television. What began as quiet kitchen clips has now stepped into a professional studio, signaling a shift that feels earned rather than manufactured. The move reflects how modern audiences reward authenticity, not polish alone, and why networks are watching creators who build trust one recipe at a time.Her rise did not come from celebrity shortcuts. It grew from consistency, warmth, and the confidence to let food tell the story. As NBC Sports Boston opens its doors to her, the moment feels less like a debut and more like a continuation of something viewers already welcomed into their daily scroll.The baking journey reached a turning point when Ann Michael Maye revealed she had completed filming her show in the NBC Sports Boston kitchen. In a video shared by the network, she said, “I’m so excited for you guys all to see it. Be sure to stay tuned in.” The project, titled “Beyond Bakemas,” builds on momentum she created during her viral holiday series, though the network has not announced an air date.Her popularity surged in late 2025 through Bakemas, a daily December tradition where she baked a new dessert each day until Christmas.The treats felt personal, not performative, ranging from peppermint chocolate chip cookies to brown sugar cinnamon swirl sourdough. Some even made their way into the Patriots locker room, a detail that connected her work to the team’s culture without forcing the link.Drake Maye acknowledged that support during a radio appearance, saying, “I get to do the good part of trying all her stuff she bakes. I try to bring some leftovers into the building.” Later, he added, “It’s been awesome. (She’s) in her little journey doing ‘Bakemas’ right now. I get to do the good part of trying all her stuff she bakes. I try to bring some leftovers into the building.”Instead of fading after the holidays, Ann pivoted. She launched a January series focused on balance, not restriction. In a TikTok welcoming the new year, she wrote, “Happy 2026!!!🥂 Starting off the new year with a series of healthy(ish) recipes,” followed by, “I’ll be posting over the next month! I love having this date bark in my fridge and it’s so easy to make.”Now heading into the NFL postseason, with New England hosting the Chargers in the Wild Card round, Ann remains a familiar presence at games.Also Read: As Nikki Bella rumors swirl, Cooper DeJean’s ex Steph Wilfawn steals spotlight with viral posts","Ann Michael Maye's rise did not come from celebrity shortcuts.

Sherrone Moore’s wife’s 911 call exposes fear, fallout, and criminal allegations



Sherrone Moore's wife’s 911 call recordings pulled from police files reveal a raw moment of fear, confusion, and urgency inside a fast moving crisis. The audio does not sound rehearsed or dramatic. It sounds like a spouse trying to keep a loved one alive while the ground collapses beneath her feet. As the call unfolds, the weight of a sudden firing, public pressure, and emotional distress becomes impossible to ignore.The call places listeners inside a night when uncertainty ruled every decision. Kelli Moore was not asking for explanations or favors. She was asking for time. Time to find her husband. Time to stop him from harming himself. Time to bring him home. What followed later would widen the story far beyond a single call, pulling in court testimony, police reports, and a career that unraveled in days.In the recording released by Ann Arbor Police, Kelli Moore tells the dispatcher she fears her husband may hurt himself after he told her he was “trying to kill himself.” Her voice breaks as she explains that he called to say he had been fired and was driving on a highway.She admits she had “no clue” where he was. She identified his vehicle as a 2025 black Chevy Tahoe and said he did not carry weapons. Again and again, she repeated that she told him to “come home. ”At one point, when asked why she was afraid, Kelli answered, “Because he said that to me ... he said he's trying to kill himself.” She added, “He just called me saying he got fired from his job, and he's in crisis. I told him that I love him and that I need him to come home, but I don't know where he is. He said he was on a highway.” Later, her plea sharpened into panic. “I just need to make sure he’s safe. He’s called a couple times, and I’m terrified he’s gonna do something to himself. I told him to come home.”Court testimony paints a darker picture of what followed. Prosecutors allege Moore confronted a former staffer who had tried to cut off contact days earlier. According to testimony, he entered her apartment, grabbed butter knives and kitchen scissors, and said, “You ruined my life.” When the staffer’s attorney came on the phone, Moore allegedly turned the knives on himself, saying he would kill himself.Moore was arrested later that day and charged with felony home invasion, misdemeanor stalking, and breaking and entering. He was released on bond in December. The University of Michigan fired him with cause over an inappropriate relationship, ending his tenure that began in 2018 and peaked when he succeeded Jim Harbaugh.Also Read: What was JJ Watt's net worth in 2025: Exploring his endorsements, investments, car collection and more","Sherrone Moore's wife's 911 call recordings reveal a raw moment of fear, confusion, and urgency inside a fast moving crisis.

She directly addressed false allegations about her father and critics rehashing her past, warning accusers of further escalation if the attacks persist. Cardi B made it clear that silence is no longer her approach to defending herself and her loved ones.

Cardi B fires back at online accusers in heated X Spaces rant

The internet rarely shocks anymore, but a recent late night outburst from Cardi B managed to do just that. Speaking openly during an emotional X Spaces session, the Grammy winner unloaded frustration that had clearly been building for weeks. What followed was raw, confrontational, and impossible to ignore, as Cardi pushed back against rumors, online attacks, and what she described as deliberate lies involving her family.The timing mattered. Cardi has been navigating nonstop controversy tied to people close to her, including renewed online chatter surrounding her relationship with Stefon Diggs and disturbing allegations falsely linked to her father.

Refusing to soften her stance, she declared, “And for y’all to be talking about, ‘Oh, she drugged and robbed…’ I’ll rob nas again.

Cooper DeJean dating rumors spark social media chatter



Cooper DeJean has quietly become one of the most talked-about young names in Philadelphia, and not just for what he does on Sundays. In a city that thrives on passion and personality, the Eagles cornerback now finds himself at the center of a conversation that blends football success with off-field curiosity. Fresh off earning his first Pro Bowl nod in only his second NFL season, DeJean’s rise feels fast, earned, and impossible to ignore.At 22, the former Iowa standout has already delivered moments fans will replay for years, including a Super Bowl pick-six against Patrick Mahomes that sealed his place in Eagles lore. Yet lately, the spotlight has widened. A single social media post showing DeJean spending time with WWE superstar Nikki Bella after a dominant home win over the Raiders sparked a wave of speculation that quickly took on a life of its own.The intrigue grew sharper because DeJean was previously linked to his longtime college girlfriend, Steph Wilfawn, during his Iowa days and early NFL career. Their breakup happened quietly, without announcements or public statements. Still, timing has a way of inviting attention, especially when new headlines emerge.Since the Bella rumors began circulating, Wilfawn has drawn notice for her subtle yet striking Instagram posts.One showed her enjoying a night out at a stylish West Hollywood bar alongside fellow model Keri Graff, paired with a simple caption, “cheers!” Another featured Wilfawn wrapped in a plush winter mink coat, captioned only “brr.” The minimalism of those posts has fueled endless interpretations among fans and followers.Some see hidden messages. Others see nothing more than playful, aesthetic snapshots from someone living her life on her own terms. The truth likely sits somewhere in between. Wilfawn has never directly addressed DeJean or the rumors.What remains clear is that DeJean continues to thrive where it matters most to Eagles fans. His performances helped propel Philadelphia to its second Super Bowl title in less than a decade. Whether viewed as a former good luck charm or simply a chapter now closed, Wilfawn’s presence is still remembered by a fan base that appreciates the journey.Also Read: Sydney Warner welcomes baby girl Bella Nicole as 49ers star Fred Warner celebrates becoming a 'family of four'","Cooper DeJean has quietly become one of the most talked-about young names in Philadelphia.

Patrick Mahomes injury update: Trainer delivers key recovery message as Chiefs part ways with coach after seven years,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/patrick-mahomes-injury-update-trainer-delivers-key-recovery-message-as-chiefs-part-ways-with-coach-after-seven-years/articleshow/126424817.cms,"The Kansas City Chiefs are navigating the offseason with a coaching staff reshuffle following a disappointing offensive season. Simultaneously, star quarterback Patrick Mahomes is making remarkable progress in his recovery from a serious knee injury. His trainer's confident message echoes past doubts, highlighting Mahomes' resilience as the team aims to maintain its high standards upon his return.

Chiefs reset the staff while Patrick Mahomes stays locked on rehab

The Kansas City Chiefs entered the heart of the offseason carrying two messages that could not be clearer. One came quietly from inside the building, where a trusted assistant coach was let go after years of service. The other arrived loudly from outside, delivered through the voice of Patrick Mahomes’ closest confidant. Together, they frame a franchise at a crossroads, balancing urgency with belief.While front office changes often speak to dissatisfaction, the tone around Mahomes remains defiant and calm. His inner circle is not selling fear or doubt. Instead, it is reminding the league that setbacks have never defined the quarterback who reshaped modern offense and expectations in Kansas City.Mahomes’ longtime trainer, Bobby Stroupe, sparked conversation with a pointed message that leaned on memory rather than medical reports. Posting an old training photo, he wrote, “Remember the last time they said,” followed by emojis, “he would never be the same.” The line was short, but its meaning was heavy. It was a direct callback to the doubts Mahomes faced after his 2020 postseason toe injury, one he returned from without losing his edge.Now, the challenge is steeper. Mahomes is rehabbing a torn ACL and LCL in his left knee after surgery in mid December. Recovery for injuries of that kind often stretches close to nine months, yet optimism inside the Chiefs’ orbit continues to grow. Head coach Andy Reid confirmed that progress has exceeded early expectations, saying, “First of all, he’s doing great.”While Mahomes focuses on recovery, the Kansas City Chiefs are reshaping their coaching staff. Wide receivers coach Connor Embree was dismissed after seven seasons, a move tied to a disappointing offensive year. Additional departures and expiring contracts signal deeper evaluation ahead.For Kansas City, these decisions reflect resolve, not panic. The message is simple. The standard remains unchanged, and when Patrick Mahomes returns, the franchise intends to meet it head on.Also Read : Brittany Mahomes opened up about online criticism and shared how Patrick Mahomes shaped her mindset","The Kansas City Chiefs are reshaping their coaching staff after a disappointing season.

Aaron Rodgers’ wife mystery deepens as Brittani misses another Steelers WAG event,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/aaron-rodgers-wife-mystery-deepens-as-brittani-misses-another-steelers-wag-event/articleshow/126415400.cms,"Aaron Rodgers' wife, Brittani, remains a mystery in Pittsburgh, months after he confirmed their marriage. Her absence from team events, including a recent holiday party, has fueled curiosity within NFL circles. Despite Rodgers' history of guarding his private life, Brittani's complete invisibility is unusual, leaving many eager to finally see her.

Why Brittani’s absence keeps fueling questions

The football side of Aaron Rodgers has followed a familiar script in Pittsburgh. Calm command. Late season momentum. Quiet confidence. What has not followed any script is the growing curiosity around his personal life, specifically the woman he confirmed as his wife last summer. Months after acknowledging he is married, Brittani remains entirely unseen, and that absence is starting to raise eyebrows inside NFL circles.The intrigue sharpened in December when several partners of Pittsburgh Steelers players gathered for a holiday pajama party hosted by Dani Watt and Havana Boswell. The event was warm, social, and well attended. One name stood out only because it was missing. Brittani was not there, and her continued absence added another layer to a mystery that has followed Rodgers since the spring.Rodgers first triggered speculation earlier in 2025 when he appeared publicly wearing a wedding ring. In June, shortly after signing a one year deal with Pittsburgh, he confirmed the marriage. Since then, the trail has gone cold. No photos. No game appearances. No sightings at team events or league functions. Even longtime NFL observers find the silence unusual.What deepens curiosity is that this is not new. Brittani was also never spotted during Rodgers’ time with the New York Jets.That means two locker room communities have yet to meet her. One Steelers wife reportedly described the situation as unusual, noting the group is eager to welcome her whenever she chooses to appear.The contrast is striking. Normani, the fiancée of DK Metcalf, also skipped the holiday gathering. Yet her relationship status is public and well established. Brittani, by comparison, has not been publicly identified at all.None of this suggests trouble. Rodgers has always guarded his private life fiercely. Still, in a league where visibility is the norm, complete invisibility invites speculation. For now, Brittani remains a name without a face, and that mystery is only growing as Rodgers’ Pittsburgh chapter continues to unfold.Also post: “I'll talk to my wife and…”: Aaron Rodgers’ wife Brittani plays a growing role in his uncertain Steelers future","Aaron Rodgers confirmed his marriage to Brittani in June.

Are Patrick Mahomes and Tyreek Hill plotting a Chiefs reunion?

The Chiefs' offense has struggled since Hill's departure, and with both players facing uncertain futures, a potential reunion could reignite Kansas City's dominance and offer a fresh start for both stars.

Patrick Mahomes and Tyreek Hill spark reunion talk after subtle social media move

The idea of a Patrick Mahomes and Tyreek Hill reunion refuses to fade. It resurfaced quietly this week through two social media posts that felt anything but random. For a Chiefs fan base still processing a rare lost season, the timing struck a nerve. Kansas City has not looked the same since Hill left, and the offense has searched for that old electricity ever since.What made the buzz louder was context. Both stars are rehabbing major knee injuries. Both teams are facing uncertain futures. And both players chose symbolism over words, letting fans connect the dots. Sometimes, silence creates the loudest speculation.Kansas City missed the playoffs for the first time in a decade after Mahomes went down late in the season. Miami struggled to find stability after Hill’s injury derailed its offense. Now, with recovery underway, the door feels slightly open again.Mahomes, the quarterback of the Kansas City Chiefs, shared two photos. One showed him walking off the field with his head down. The other captured a rushing touchdown celebration. His caption was a single clock emoji. Minutes later, Tyreek Hill posted two intense images of himself screaming, helmet on and off, with the caption “Loading.”Fans quickly noticed both posts appeared within a short window, igniting theories of coordination.Hill’s season ended in September after tearing multiple ligaments in his left knee against the Jets. Mahomes suffered a torn ACL and LCL in December versus the Chargers, a blow that reshaped the Chiefs’ season. Head coach Andy Reid later addressed Mahomes’ recovery, saying, “Right now, he's in that early process where you've got to hit it hard.” He added, “He's been in there grinding,” underscoring Mahomes’ focus on returning for Week 1 of 2026.Mahomes still posted solid numbers in 2025, completing 62.7 percent of his passes for 3,587 yards with 22 touchdowns. Yet the offense lacked its old fear factor. A potential reunion with Hill would instantly change that.Miami’s direction remains unclear, with questions around coaching and quarterback consistency. Kansas City, meanwhile, may be forced to reimagine its roster after a sudden fall from dominance. If opportunity meets ambition, a reunion could benefit both sides.For now, it remains speculation. But the hints were deliberate. And in the NFL, deliberate moments often lead somewhere.Also post: Brittany Mahomes’ message to Patrick Mahomes' mom Randi catches attention during Chiefs downfall","Patrick Mahomes and Tyreek Hill have fueled reunion speculation with coordinated social media posts while both recover from major knee injuries.

What does Rashee Rice 's situation mean for Chiefs?



Rashee Rice domestic violence allegations put Chiefs and NFL under scrutiny

Rashee Rice domestic violence allegations surfaced publicly on Wednesday, placing the Kansas City Chiefs once again under an intense national spotlight. The franchise moved quickly to acknowledge the situation, confirming it is aware of claims circulating online and is coordinating with the NFL as the league monitors developments. While the statement offered little detail, the timing and gravity of the accusations have amplified scrutiny around the young wide receiver’s troubled recent history.Rashee Rice allegations have placed the Kansas City Chiefs at a crossroads they did not expect to face this offseason. The franchise is already preparing for rare coaching staff turnover, yet the conversation inside the building has shifted fast. What should have been a routine contract discussion has turned into a test of judgment, patience, and public trust.Rice is entering the final year of his rookie deal, a stage where extensions usually arrive quietly. Instead, uncertainty now hangs over his future in Kansas City. With fresh allegations surfacing, the Chiefs must pause any long term commitment while the league reviews the matter. The timing could not be worse for a team built on stability and careful roster planning.From a financial view, moving on would be painless. Releasing Rice would leave less than $500,000 in dead cap space. The real cost sits elsewhere. The Chiefs must weigh the reaction of fans and sponsors against the impact of losing a productive receiver in his prime.That balance is never easy, especially when no charges have been filed and the legal process remains incomplete.The league’s personal conduct policy complicates the picture further. Rice is innocent until proven guilty, and the NFL often waits for legal outcomes before acting. Still, history matters. Only months ago, Rice served a six game suspension after a Dallas judge sentenced him to 30 days in jail and five years’ probation following a multi vehicle crash. He pleaded guilty to two third degree felony charges, a fact that keeps him under closer scrutiny now.Repeat cases tend to draw harsher penalties, and the league has shown little patience in similar situations. A lengthy suspension, even a full season, is not out of the question. For the Chiefs, the coming weeks are less about talent and more about accountability. How they respond may define their standards long after this case fades from headlines.In a brief response provided to PEOPLE, the Chiefs avoided specifics but made their position clear. “The club is aware of the allegations on social media and is in communication with the National Football League. We have no further comment at this time,” the team said in a statement to PEOPLE when reached for comment on Wednesday, Jan. 7. The organization did not name Rice directly, though the context left little ambiguity.Rice’s ex-girlfriend, Dacoda Nichole Jones, shared a series of photos on Instagram showing bruises, injuries, and damage inside a home. In her account, she described years of alleged physical and emotional abuse, including incidents during pregnancy and harm affecting their children. While she stopped short of naming Rice in the caption, the post quickly gained traction across social platforms, drawing reactions from fans and public figures alike.As of Wednesday, no police report tied to Jones’ claims had been filed. Advocates and experts note that delayed reporting is common in abusive relationships, often due to fear, financial dependence, or emotional control. These factors underscore why investigations in such cases require patience and care rather than rushes to judgment.Rice, 25, has not responded publicly to the allegations. Attempts to reach him or his representatives were unsuccessful. The situation revives memories of his 2024 legal troubles stemming from a high-speed crash in Dallas that injured multiple people. In April of that year, Rice issued a public apology, stating, “I take full responsibility for my part in this matter and will continue to cooperate with the necessary authorities. I sincerely apologize to everyone impacted in Saturday’s accident.”For now, the Chiefs and the NFL appear to be in a wait-and-see posture. As the league reviews the matter, the outcome may hinge on whether formal complaints or investigations follow. Until then, the allegations alone have reopened broader conversations about accountability, support for victims, and how professional sports respond when serious claims surface off the field.Also Read: Rashee Rice accused of years-long domestic abuse as ex-girlfriend’s allegations spark fresh controversy around NFL star","Rashee Rice allegations have placed the Kansas City Chiefs at a crossroads they did not expect to face this offseason.

Despite the seemingly casual encounter, sources indicate Brady is uneasy due to Earle's public social media habits, valuing discretion after years in the spotlight. This situation underscores Brady's strict approach to privacy for anyone entering his personal life.

Why Tom Brady is already uneasy after his viral night with Alix Earle

Fresh footage from a New Year’s celebration in St. Barts has placed Tom Brady back under the relationship microscope. The retired quarterback was seen spending time with influencer Alix Earle, sparking instant buzz across social media. What seemed to be light-hearted and casual became soon a more serious discussion on trust, privacy, and boundaries.Although the background seemed carefree, it has been reported that Brady has been much more restrained in his response. After decades in the public eye, he has learned how quickly casual moments can spiral into headlines. The attention surrounding Earle, especially so soon after her breakup, has reportedly triggered caution rather than excitement.According to entertainment reporter Rob Shuter, the issue is not the interaction itself but how visible it became. “That's a huge red flag,” a source told Shuter. “Tom values discretion above everything. He's not interested in a girlfriend who broadcasts every detail of her life.”That concern ties directly to Brady’s long relationship with fame. Another source explained why he is already on alert. “Tom's learned who to trust after decades in the public eye,” a Hollywood manager said.“He's already thinking about privacy and discretion, and Alix's social media habits are sending warning signals. This isn't the first time Hollywood has watched someone get too excited around him, and he's not repeating that mistake.”Earle’s recent split from Braxton Berrios adds another layer. After confirming the breakup publicly, she explained the emotional toll of long distance. “Braxton and I are no longer together,” Earle said. “We have been doing long distance since, basically, June and we haven't gotten to see each other that often. It's just been really difficult for me.”She added that being in different places pushed her to focus inward and reset priorities.For now, there is no confirmation that Brady and Earle are anything more than two people who crossed paths at a high-profile event. Still, the situation highlights how seriously Brady guards his personal life. For anyone entering his orbit, privacy is not optional. It is the first test.Also post: Gisele Bündchen recalls emotional fallout after learning Tom Brady had a child with another woman","The retired quarterback was seen spending time with influencer Alix Earle, sparking instant buzz across social media.

It was during the program “The Association” with host MJ Acousta Ruiz, Tristan Thompson and Cuttino Mobley. One of the topics was about A’ja Wilson and Bam Adebayo’s power couple status.

Tristan’s weird prediction reminds of Wilson’s Times Magazine interview confession.During the discussion at “The Association” program between MJ Acousta Ruiz, Tristan Thompson and Cuttino Mobley, the camera in the stadium moved towards A’ja Wilson. The Las Vegas Aces star was present in support of her partner, Bam Adebayo. Wilson was wearing a grey sweatsuit. Tristan complimented the suit before the camera moved to show Bam on the screen.MJ Acousta quickly referred to him as “A’ja Wilson’s boyfriend. ” This was when the weird prediction came in from Tristan.Cuttino Mobley was the first one to speak up. He stated, “Imagine that child!” Tristan took the opportunity and added, “Listen, that kid better be an NBA player. He better not be putting boxes in FedEx. He is gonna be so tall.” MJ Acousta was visibly annoyed by the job analogy and exclaimed, “Boxes in FedEx??? Tristan, please!” Tristan, however, did not stop and hilariously continued, “You know this kid is going to be 7 feet 100%. If he gets his Mama's talent and his Dad's toughness, it'll be one of the greatest of all time.""

Breanna Stewart and the call for value



Cathy Engelbert and WNBPA's financial crossroad



As the January 9 deadline looms over the WNBA, New York Liberty star and WNBPA Vice President Breanna Stewart has confirmed that a new labor agreement will not be reached in time. Despite months of high-stakes discussions and previous extensions, the league and the players' association remain at a significant impasse. Stewart made it clear that while players are committed to negotiating in good faith, they will not settle for an extension or a deal that fails to reflect the league's skyrocketing valuation.Women's sports have seen an exponential hike in recent years, especially in 2025, when Deloitte estimated the WNBA’s revenue to surpass $1 billion. Playing in a league that is expanding on a global scale, the players feel that they are not being paid fairly. Brenna Stewart has come out to be one of these leading voices for a generation of players who feel the current salary model of the WNBA has become a thing of the past.The WNBPA's latest proposal reportedly seeks roughly 30% of gross revenue and a salary cap jump to approximately $10.5 million, a massive leap from the current $1.5 million cap. For Stewart, this isn't just about a paycheck, it's about aligning player compensation with the WNBA's new $2.2 billion media rights deal.Back in July 2025, Napheesa Collier, WNBPA Vice President, addressed the same issue and said, “We're on a time crunch. No one wants a lockout. ""But at the end of the day, we have to stand firm, and we're not going to be moved on certain topics. So hopefully the league comes back quickly so that we can get have more dialogue, more conversations and can get the ball rolling.""The league’s lack of urgency and no intention of budging will not affect the players. Stewart has conveyed that the players are ready for a standoff. . This firm stance is backed by a membership that voted 98% in favor of authorizing a strike if necessary, signaling that the ""status quo"" is no longer an option.On the other side of the table, WNBA Commissioner Cathy Engelbert and league leadership have expressed deep concerns over the union's financial demands. The league has pushed back, claiming that the players' revenue-sharing model could lead to $700 million in losses over the duration of the agreement. While the league has offered a 70% net revenue split, the union argues this actually equates to less than 15% of the total pie.This deadlock now moves the league into a period of uncertainty. While a lockout or strike isn't immediate, the lack of an extension delays critical off-season events like free agency and the expansion drafts for the upcoming Portland and Toronto franchises. As the 2026 season approaches, the pressure is on Engelbert to find a middle ground that rewards the players without jeopardizing the league's long-term business stability.Also read: “The sides remain apart”: WNBA CBA negotiations hit roadblock as deadline nears",The WNBA and the WNBPA are at an impasse over a new labor agreement.

Rapper Cormega rips LeBron James’ agent, Rich Paul, for his take on Michael Jordan



What did Rich Paul say about Michael Jordan?



The long-running debate around Michael Jordan LeBron James , and sneaker culture was highlighted once again after comments from Rich Paul sparked loud reactions online. Paul, one of the most powerful agents in sports and LeBron James’ longtime representative, questioned why Air Jordans became a cultural force. His comments did not sit well with many longtime fans who grew up watching Jordan dominate the court and revolutionize global basketball culture.Among the strongest responses came from veteran New York rapper Cormega. He stepped outside his usual lane to address what he saw as a flawed narrative. His reaction quickly spread across social media.Cormega responded after Rich Paul suggested that Air Jordan sales were driven as much by street status as by admiration for Jordan himself. The rapper pushed back by pointing to Jordan’s rise well before his NBA fame. He further commented on Jordan’s NCAA title run, Olympic dominance, and early NBA performances.On Instagram, Cormega shared a detailed statement that challenged the idea that sneaker culture was shaped by lifestyle figures rather than on-court moments. He wrote, ""I usually don’t do this but I have to. This guy says people didn’t buy Michael Jordan sneakers because of Jordan.He said they wanted Jordan’s because dope boys wore them. I respectfully disagree.""Cormega went on to outline Jordan’s evolution, his impact during playoff battles, and how each new sneaker silhouette appeared during historic moments. He also stressed Jordan’s universal appeal across age groups, cultures, and genders, calling attention to his presence in movies, music, and global events. According to Cormega, Jordan’s influence endured because performance created belief, and belief created demand.Rich Paul made his remarks during a podcast appearance with Max Kellerman, where he discussed branding, timing, and influence. Paul argued that while many fans wanted to be like Jordan, others wanted the image associated with those wearing Jordans in popular culture.He stated, ""People didn't buy MJs because they wanted to be like Michael Jordan. That was half of the people. You know what the other half was? They wanted to be like Max, who had the BMW and the cute girl, and who had on the Michael Jordans.""On top of that, Paul discussed Nike and Gatorade’s marketing power. “Michael Jordan had two really, really, really great partners,” he shared on the podcast. LeBron James' agent further credited storytelling, media placement, and cultural visibility for expanding Jordan Brand into a global empire. While Paul later clarified he did not intend to diminish Jordan, the reaction from fans and figures like Cormega shows Jordan’s legacy is still intactAlso Read: LeBron James’ astonishing basketball IQ gets stamp of approval from ex-Cavaliers teammate: ""That’s not normal""","Rapper Cormega rips LeBron James' agent, Rich Paul, for his take on Michael Jordan.

Jos Buttler Exclusive Interview: I owe Jayawardene for letting me open in T20

Gujarat Titans captain Shubman Gill has been fined Rs 12 lakh for maintaining a slow over-rate during their IPL 2025 match against Delhi Capitals at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad on Saturday, marking the team's first over-rate offense of the season.The penalty was imposed under Article 2.22 of the IPL's Code of Conduct, which deals with minimum over-rate offenses. Gill, who was run out for seven runs in the match, joins other captains who have faced similar fines this season.DC's Axar Patel, MI's Hardik Pandya, RR's Riyan Parag and Sanju Samson, and LSG's Rishabh Pant have all previously been fined for over-rate offenses in IPL 2025.Despite the penalty, Gujarat Titans emerged victorious in the match, successfully chasing down 204 runs with four balls remaining in challenging Ahmedabad heat conditions.Jos Buttler played a crucial role in the victory, scoring an unbeaten 97 off 54 balls. He formed significant partnerships of 60 runs with B. Sai Sudharsan and 119 runs with Sherfane Rutherford.The chase marked a historic moment for GT as it was their first successful pursuit of a 200-plus total in their IPL history. It was also the first time any team had chased such a target against Delhi Capitals.GT's bowling attack contributed significantly, with Prasidh Krishna taking 4-41. Mohammed Siraj, Arshad Khan, Ishant Sharma, and R. Sai Kishore each claimed one wicket.The victory has propelled Gujarat Titans, the IPL 2022 champions, to the top of the 2025 season points table with 10 points from seven games. Delhi Capitals currently hold the second position, separated only by net run rate.GT will next face defending champions Kolkata Knight Riders at Eden Gardens on Monday evening, which notably is Gill's former IPL team.","Gujarat Titans captain Shubman Gill has been fined Rs 12 lakh for maintaining a slow over-rate during their IPL 2025 match against Delhi Capitals.

NEW DELHI: Lucknow Super Giants edged Rajasthan Royals by just two runs in a dramatic IPL 2025 clash at the Sawai Mansingh Stadium, thanks to a nerveless final over from Avesh Khan that turned a seemingly straightforward chase into a heartbreaker for the home crowd.Chasing 181, Rajasthan Royals were well in the hunt needing just nine runs off the last over with six wickets in hand.Set batters Shimron Hetmyer and Dhruv Jurel were at the crease, and with the dew settling in and umpires opting to change the ball, it looked like a formality.But Avesh Khan had other plans.The over began with a sharp yorker that Jurel could only flick for a single. Then came a wide, angled delivery to Hetmyer, yielding just two after a misfield.On the third ball, Avesh outfoxed Hetmyer with a full, straight delivery. The West Indian tried to flick it but picked out Shardul Thakur at backward square leg. It was a massive breakthrough that shifted the momentum.New batter Shubham Dubey was greeted with a toe-crushing yorker for a dot. Pressure mounted.The fifth ball, which was supposed to be a yorker, came as a full toss, and Dubey launched it high over long-on, but fortune favoured the batter as David Miller dropped a straightforward chance. Two runs were taken.With four needed off the final ball, Dubey drilled it straight back.The ball struck Avesh's hand and deflected away, but not far enough. Just a single was managed. Game over.LSG had pulled off a thrilling heist, winning by two runs and sparking wild celebrations.Avesh finished with figures of 3/37, but it was his final over -- full of composure, execution, and nerves of steel -- that will be remembered. He not only dismissed two of Rajasthan’s most dangerous hitters, including Yashasvi Jaiswal (74), Riyan Parag (34), and finally Hetmyer, but also kept his cool in a moment where many have faltered.This wasn't just a win; it was a statement from LSG. And Avesh Khan was its loudest voice.","Lucknow Super Giants beat Rajasthan Royals by two runs in IPL 2025 clash. Avesh Khan took three wickets for just three runs in the final over.

Abhishek Sharma (40 off 28) gave them a strong start, while Heinrich Klaasen (37 off 28) anchored the innings in the middle.However, despite some late hitting from Aniket Verma (18 off 8), the total looked below par.

Poll Do you believe a mentor's role is crucial for a team's success? Not really, players can manage on their own. Yes, absolutely!

In the buildup to the much-anticipated Indian Premier League clash between Gujarat Titans and Delhi Capitals at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad on Saturday, a light-hearted exchange between KL Rahul and Delhi Capitals mentor Kevin Pietersen stole the spotlight — and the internet’s heart.The Delhi Capitals' social media team posted a seemingly innocent video of GT skipper Shubman Gill greeting Pietersen during practice. The two exchanged pleasantries before Pietersen, with his trademark charm, posed a rhetorical question: “Bro, what’s a mentor? No one knows what a mentor is. Can you tell me what a mentor is?”Just as Gill chuckled, KL Rahul — who was nearby, gearing up for the session — chimed in with a zinger that had everyone in splits.“Mentor is someone who goes to Maldives for two weeks mid-season,” Rahul quipped, sending Pietersen into a smile as others around joined the laughter.The Capitals’ admin didn’t miss the opportunity to ride the wave, captioning the clip: “Thanks, KL, now we know what a mentor does.”After the video went viral, Pietersen replied to Rahul through a social media post explaining the role of a 'mentor' in a funny way.""Mentor - The wise and sagacious guide of a cricket team who, through a mysterious blend of tactical genius and holiday planning, ensures the team is as adept at swinging bats as they are at swinging in hammocks.

Often spotted with a clipboard in one hand and a travel brochure in the other,"" Pietersen wrote.On the field, DC, under the captaincy of Axar Patel , will look to maintain their pole position on the points table, having won five of their six matches.

NEW DELHI: New Zealand’s batting icon Kane Williamson shared his vision for the next era of cricketing greatness during an exclusive conversation with senior journalist K. Shriniwas Rao on TimesofIndia.com's latest episode of Bombay Sport Exchange When asked to name his “next Fab Four,” Williamson chuckled and replied, ""The five players that come to mind would be Yashasvi Jaiswal (India), Shubman Gill (India), Rachin Ravindra (New Zealand), Harry Brook (England) and Cameron Green from Australia.""Also See: MI vs SRH Coming from a player who is himself part of the modern ""Fab Four"" alongside Virat Kohli Steve Smith , and Joe Root, this endorsement carries tremendous weight.With over 9,276 Test runs at an average of 54.9, including 33 centuries, Williamson’s words reflect not just respect but a keen eye for future legends.The young Indian opener is enjoying a meteoric rise in the longer format, having already scored 1,798 runs in 19 Tests at an average of 52.9, including 4 centuries.His calm temperament and aggressive shot-making have made him a force at the top of the order.He was also part of India’s T20 World Cup-winning team, showing his growing presence in white-ball cricket, although he is yet to make his ODI debut.Gill’s classical style and adaptability have seen him become a regular in all three formats.In Tests, he has scored 1,893 runs in 32 matches with 5 centuries, averaging 35.While he hasn't quite replicated his white-ball dominance in the Test arena, he is widely regarded as the future captain of India's white-ball sides, thanks to his maturity and consistency in ODIs and T20Is.One of the most consistent and dependable new faces in the New Zealand setup, Rachin has been a key figure across all formats.In Tests, he’s scored 1,057 runs in 15 matches, averaging 37.8, with 2 centuries, including a career-best 240.His ability to slot into any role and contribute with both bat and ball makes him an all-format asset for the Kiwis.Harry Brook has been a revelation in red-ball cricket for England.In just 24 Tests, he has amassed 2,281 runs at a stunning average of 58.5, with 8 centuries and a high score of 317.His explosive style and aggression align perfectly with England’s ""Bazball"" strategy.Recognizing his potential as a leader and limited-overs performer, Brook has now been appointed England’s white-ball captain, marking a new chapter in his career.Despite battling recent injuries, Cameron Green remains a crucial all-rounder for Australia, offering balance with both bat and ball.In Tests, he’s scored 1,377 runs in 28 matches at an average of 36.2, with 2 centuries and a top score of 174*.His 13 sixes and 152 fours reflect his ability to shift gears, and when fully fit, Green is a game-changer in all three formats.Williamson’s nod to these five reflects both current performance and future potential.As the ""Fab Four"" era edges toward its twilight, this ""Fab Five"" could well be the torchbearers of the next golden generation of Test cricket.","Kane Williamson names five players to watch out for in next generation of cricketers.

NEW DELHI: Delhi Capitals (DC) take on Shubman Gill’s Gujarat Titans (GT) in Match No. 35 of the Indian Premier League ( IPL ) at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad on Saturday. The Capitals currently sit atop the points table with 10 points from six games, while Gujarat trail just behind with eight points from eight outings.DC will walk in high on confidence after their edge-of-the-seat Super Over victory against Rajasthan Royals -- a game where Mitchell Starc turned the tide with his ice-cold death-over brilliance. The Aussie speedster, known for his pinpoint yorkers and late swing, was the architect of that heist and continues to lead the pace attack with authority.But Starc and co. will be up against a GT top order that’s looked ominous. Shubman Gill’s fluent strokeplay, Sai Sudharsan’s consistency, and Jos Buttler’s explosiveness have powered Gujarat’s batting thus far. Between them, they’ve notched up at least one fifty in every match — and DC will know that cracking that code early could unravel the Titans.On the flip side, all eyes will be on Mohammed Siraj, who’s found his groove after a testing season of international cricket. Siraj, fresh and firing, has bagged 10 wickets with a miserly economy of 8.50 — especially potent in the Powerplay. His matchup against Delhi’s young openers Jake Fraser-McGurk and Abishek Porel will be one to watch. The duo has shown flashes of potential but faces a stern examination under the Ahmedabad sun.And should early wickets fall, the Capitals will lean on veterans KL Rahul and Karun Nair to anchor the innings. Local lad Axar Patel, who plies his domestic trade for Gujarat, will be keen to shine at his home ground — especially now that he’s back in form with both bat and ball.Spin could prove decisive on a dry Ahmedabad deck. GT will back their seasoned duo of Rashid Khan and R Sai Kishore to keep things tight in the middle overs, while DC’s Kuldeep Yadav — if fit — will be their X-factor. His wrist spin has been Delhi’s trump card, ably complemented by the promising Vipraj Nigam. But Kuldeep’s availability remains in question after a shoulder niggle saw him leave the field in their last outing.Traditionally a true surface with pace and bounce, the Ahmedabad pitch this season has played slower than expected in afternoon games. Batters who apply themselves early can reap rewards later, but spinners and cutters into the surface have found assistance. With the match scheduled for 3:30 PM, dew won't be a factor, but dryness might.Jake Fraser-McGurk, Abishek Porel, KL Rahul, Karun Nair, Axar Patel (c), Tristan Stubbs, Mitchell Starc, Mukesh Kumar, Mohit Sharma, Dushmantha Chameera, Kuldeep Yadav (if fit) / Vipraj NigamAshutosh SharmaShubman Gill (c), B Sai Sudharsan, Jos Buttler (wk), Shahrukh Khan, Rahul Tewatia, Rashid Khan, R Sai Kishore, Mohammed Siraj, Prasidh Krishna, Kagiso Rabada, Washington SundarKarim JanatA dry and hot afternoon is expected in Ahmedabad, with temperatures hovering between 33°C and 41°C.

Gujarat Titans displaced Delhi Capitals at the top of the IPL 2025 points table following their 7-wicket win against them at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad on Saturday afternoon. In the second contest, Lucknow Super Giants held on by the smallest of margins to edge Rajasthan Royals and climb one place in the standings.As per the latest standings, GT, DC, Punjab Kings and LSG occupy the top four spots, which earn teams a playoff berth, with Royal Challengers Bengaluru , Kolkata Knight Riders, Mumbai Indians, RR, Sunrisers Hyderabad and Chennai Super Kings rounding off the 10-team table.RR's loss keeps them in the eighth place in the standings and has further hurt their chances of qualifying for the playoffs with just two wins out of eight matches played as the tournament goes past its halfway mark.In the evening game of the double header, LSG pacer Avesh Khan grabbed three crucial wickets as they beat RR by two runs in a thrilling IPL clash. For the Royals, Yashasvi Jaiswal slammed a half-century, while teenager Vaibhav Suryavanshi made a huge impact.Aiden Markram and Ayush Badoni struck half centuries and shared a 76-run fourth-wicket partnership as LSG put up 180 for 5.In reply, Jaiswal (74), Riyan Parag (39) and young Vaibhav (34) put RR in a winning position before Avesh, who returned figures of 3/37 by taking the wickets of Jaiswal, Parag and Shimron Hetmyer, restricted the hosts to 178 for 5.Earlier in the day, Jos Buttler smashed an unbeaten 97 and shared a 119-run partnership with Sherfane Rutherford (43) as Gujarat Titans defeated Delhi Capitals by seven wickets.Chasing a challenging 204-run target, Buttler took just 54 balls for his 97 (11x4, 4x6), as GT completed the task in 19.2 overs.Earlier, invited to bat, DC managed 203 for eight on an easy-paced pitch with skipper Axar Patel top-scoring for the visitors with his 39-run knock off 32 balls, while Tristian Stubbs (31) and Ashutosh Sharma (37) also made useful contributions for their side.Pacer Prasid Krishna (4/41) was the standout bowler for the home side.",Gujarat Titans displaced Delhi Capitals at the top of the IPL 2025 points table.

Playoffs Prediction

NEW DELHI: Ever since the retentions were announced, Rajasthan Royals (RR) became a hot topic of discussion -- but for all the wrong reasons.Almost everyone was surprised when they let go of star players like Jos Buttler , Trent Boult, and Yuzvendra Chahal, while choosing to retain the likes of Dhruv Jurel, Shimron Hetmyer, and Riyan Parag Now, after seven games, the Royals find themselves in the bottom half of the table. So how has their campaign gone so far? Jofra Archer had a nightmare start to the season, conceding 76 runs in his 4 overs against SRH. It was the most expensive spell in IPL history as he went wicketless in his first two games.But ever since then, Archer has looked close to his best. He’s bowled brilliantly in the powerplay and has been one of the few bright spots for RR in recent matches.Beyond Archer, the bowling lineup has looked all over the place.Tushar Deshpande has been leaking runs, and the Sri Lankan spin duo of Maheesh Theekshana and Wanidu Hasaranga hasn’t come close to replicating the success that Chahal and Ashwin brought to the team.Quiz: Who's that IPL player? In the batting department, inconsistency has plagued the top order.Openers Jaiswal and Samson have scored 233 and 224 runs respectively across 7 games.While Jaiswal has managed three fifties, Samson has struggled to convert his starts, with the exception of a strong knock in the season opener.Riyan Parag, who was expected to build on his form from last season, hasn’t delivered, and Jurel too hasn’t lived up to expectations.To realistically qualify for the playoffs, the Royals would need to win six out of their remaining seven matches — a tall task.While not impossible, the chances of such a turnaround are slim. As things stand, RR would need something close to a miracle to stay alive in the race for a playoff spot.","Rajasthan Royals are in the bottom half of the IPL table.

NEW DELHI: Star batter Jos Buttler played a sensational match-winning knock of 97 not out to guide Gujarat Titans (GT) to a commanding seven-wicket victory over Delhi Capitals (DC) in a high-scoring IPL 2025 clash at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad on Saturday.With this emphatic win, Gujarat not only handed DC their second loss of the season but also soared to the top of the points table. All three of GT, DC, and Punjab Kings (PBKS) now have 10 points from seven matches, but GT’s superior net run rate (+0.984) pushed them above DC (+0.589) and PBKS (+0.308).Chasing a daunting target of 204, Gujarat were dealt an early blow when skipper Shubman Gill was run out for just 7 in the second over. However, Buttler, at his vintage best, stepped up with a composed yet authoritative innings. After adding a brisk 60-run partnership with Sai Sudharsan (36), Buttler took complete charge of the chase.Mixing calculated aggression with calm composure, Buttler carved the DC bowling attack with finesse. His unbeaten 54-ball knock, studded with 11 fours and four sixes, was the backbone of GT's chase. Despite Sudharsan's dismissal in the 8th over, the Englishman never let the momentum dip.Partnering with Sherfane Rutherford (43 off 34), Buttler forged a match-winning 119-run stand for the third wicket that left DC bowlers searching for answers.

But it was Prasidh Krishna’s fiery spell of 4/41 that pegged DC back in crucial phases, denying them a bigger total.The Titans' clinical all-round display — highlighted by Buttler's brilliance — saw them leapfrog their rivals and issue a strong statement in the race for playoff spots.",Gujarat Titans beat Delhi Capitals by seven wickets in IPL 2025 clash.

Three games at home, two away and hopefully we can achieve this big success to qualify for the Champions League.""Relegated Southampton rescued a 1-1 draw at West Ham to guarantee they won't have the indignity of being the lone club with the Premier League's worst ever points tally.Jarrod Bowen struck for the Hammers in the 47th minute, holding off Ryan Manning before lashing a fierce finish past Aaron Ramsdale.But Lesley Ugochukwu equalised three minutes into second half stoppage-time as he lashed past Alphonse Areola.Bottom of the table Southampton are now on 11 points -- the same number Derby managed in 2007-08 -- and have five games left to leave the Rams with the lowest total ever recorded in the Premier League.Brentford beat 10-man Brighton 4-2 to damage the Seagulls' prospects of qualifying for Europe with their first home win since December.Thomas Frank's side took a ninth minute lead when Lewis Keane-Potter's precise pass through the heart of the Brighton defence picked out Bryan Mbeumo and he confidently slotted homeDanny Welbeck hauled Brighton level in first half stoppage-time with a powerful header from Mats Wieffer's cross.Mbeumo restored Brentford's advantage three minutes after half-time, his strike taking a hefty deflection off Brighton defender Lewis Dunk on its way past Bart Verbruggen.Yoane Wissa bagged Brentford's third in the 58th minute, running onto Mbeumo's pass and finishing with the help of a deflection off Jan Paul van Hecke.Brighton striker Joao Pedro was sent off in the 61st minute for a needless kick at Nathan Collins.Japan forward Kaoru Mitoma reduced the deficit in the 81st minute, but Christian Norgaard headed home in stoppage-time to end Brighton's hopes of a late escape.Crystal Palace held on for a 0-0 draw against Bournemouth despite playing half the match with 10 men.Palace were reduced to 10 men just before half-time at Selhurst Park when Chris Richards was sent off for a second booking after the defender fouled Justin Kluivert.Third-placed Newcastle will look to step up their Champions League qualification surge when they travel to Aston Villa in Saturday's late game.",Manchester City beat Everton 2-0 in English Premier League.

Barcelona staged a remarkable comeback to defeat Celta Vigo 4-3 at home on Saturday, extending their La Liga lead to seven points over Real Madrid. After trailing 3-1 with less than 30 minutes remaining, Barcelona's Dani Olmo and Raphinha , who scored twice including a 98th-minute penalty, secured the crucial victory.Barcelona took an early lead through Ferran Torres in the 12th minute, who scored from the edge of the box after finding space in Celta's defence.Celta Vigo responded quickly, with Borja Iglesias equalising three minutes later. Pablo Duran's cross found Iglesias, who scored into an empty net after goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny failed to intercept.Barcelona's attempts to regain the lead saw Raphinha sending a free-kick over the bar and Robert Lewandowski missing the target. Szczesny made important saves from Ilaix Moriba and Iker Losada at the other end.Iglesias put Celta ahead early in the second half, capitalizing on Frenkie de Jong's error to score past Szczesny. He later completed his hat-trick after being set up by Sergio Carreira, taking advantage of Barcelona's high defensive line.""This is football, we really wanted to win, maybe we weren't at our best but the response from the team, and the fans pushed us on... we deserved it,"" Olmo told DAZN. ""These are three points that take us closer to our objective, they're important and we have to continue.""Barcelona coach Hansi Flick had initially rested 17-year-old Lamine Yamal for the first time in 2025 but brought him on after Iglesias' third goal.The comeback began when Raphinha assisted Olmo, who beat goalkeeper Vicente Guaita. Raphinha then scored himself, heading in Yamal's cross from the right.Celta missed a chance to secure the win when Oscar Mingueza headed wide from close range in the 90th minute.The decisive moment came in the 96th minute when VAR review led to a penalty after Yoel Lago fouled Olmo. With Lewandowski substituted, Raphinha converted the spot-kick into the top-right corner.""It's a bittersweet feeling... we scored three, which few teams can do here, but it feels bad,"" said Celta's Duran. ""We have to be proud of our team, we came here with personality, played well, had a good plan and carried it out -- but for small details it got away from us.""The victory maintains Barcelona's strong position in the title race, with Real Madrid set to face Athletic Bilbao on Sunday and a Clasico matchup scheduled for May.Celta Vigo, currently seventh in La Liga and competing for European qualification, showed attacking prowess throughout the match despite the eventual defeat.","Barcelona come from behind to defeat Celta Vigo 4-3 in La Liga.

Manchester, Apr 18, 2025 -Manchester United came from 4-2 down in extra-time to beat Lyon 5-4 in a remarkable Europa League quarter-final to progress 7-6 on aggregate on Thursday.United's season looked over when Lyon came from 2-0 down to lead by two goals with just six minutes remaining at Old Trafford despite having captain Corentin Tolisso sent off.However, a Bruno Fernandes ' penalty, Kobbie Mainoo's strike and Harry Maguire's header capped a stunning finale to set up a semi-final meeting with Athletic Bilbao.""I felt that here everything is possible,"" said United boss Ruben Amorim . ""After the 4-3, the penalty from Bruno, you feel that you can change the game.""The Red Devils sit 14th in the English top flight and defeat would have almost certainly meant missing out on European football entirely next season.Instead they are just three games away from a European trophy and the lifeline of direct access to the riches of the Champions League next season.""Everybody in this moment believes it is possible,"" added Amorim.""One moment can change a lot of things in the players' minds.""United's history is built on dramatic late fightbacks, but few have been more remarkable than this to leave Lyon shellshocked.The home side got off to a flying start thanks to a fine team goal as Fernandes released Alejandro Garnacho down the right and his cross picked out Ugarte to slot in just his second goal since joining the English giants from Paris Saint-Germain.Amorim's decision to restore Andre Onana in goal was under scrutiny.The Cameroonian had been dropped for Sunday's 4-1 thrashing at Newcastle after two costly errors that led to both Lyon's goals in last week's 2-2 first leg draw.Those mistakes came after a war of words with former United midfielder Nemanja Matic, who labelled him ""one of the worst goalkeepers in United's history"".The 29-year-old rewarded his manager's faith with a couple of important stops to prevent Lyon levelling through Paul Akouokou and Rayan Cherki.At the other end, a United side that have often looked laboured and lacking in ideas all season, suddenly clicked into gear in the first 45 minutes.United doubled their lead in first-half stoppage time when Maguire's long ball was expertly controlled by Diogo Dalot, who then fired in off the inside of the post.Garnacho should have killed the tie off within minutes of the restart for the second half when he shot straight at Lucas Perri with Fernandes begging for a pass for a tap in.But the defensive deficiencies and mental fragility of Amorim's side were exposed in a collapse that threatened to cap a miserable campaign.Alexandre Lacazette flicked on Moussa Niakhate's header and Corentin Tolisso swooped to head in and give the visitors a lifeline.Nicolas Tagliafico then prodded in at the back post despite Onana's attempt to scoop it off the line.Just as Lyon were in the ascendency Tolisso gave them a mountain to climb again with a soft second yellow for a trip on Casemiro.Yet, it did not initially matter as Cherki confirmed his status as one of Europe's rising stars with a powerful drive that left Onana motionless.Lyon's other prized asset, Malick Fofana, was then chopped down by Luke Shaw inside the area and Lacazette confidently dispatched the resulting spot-kick.Another penalty at the other end, though, kickstarted the fightback as Fernandes fired home after a VAR review for a foul on Casemiro.Substitute Mainoo showed why he had been thrust in an unfamiliar forward role with a composed finish to level on 120 minutes.Barely 60 seconds later Maguire completed the comeback with a towering header at the back post.""In this moment it is difficult to believe what has just happened,"" said Lyon coach Paulo Fonseca.It is the first time ever in European competition that five goals have been scored in extra-time.",Manchester United came from 4-2 down in extra-time to beat Lyon 5-4 in a remarkable Europa League quarter-final to progress 7-6 on aggregate.

""We knew we were going to suffer, but we knew we were going to win.

How Nico Mueller secured the top spot

Andretti driver Nico Mueller and his race engineer Bertrand Mermine have surged to the top of the ABB Engineered to Outrun leaderboard following a dramatic Miami Grand Prix, where post-race penalties reshuffled the final standings in Mueller’s favour. Though he originally crossed the line in 10th, Mueller was promoted to 4th, thanks to a well-timed strategy and a dash of late-race chaos. His calculated decision to split Attack Mode usage proved decisive, paying off when several drivers were hit with time penalties after the chequered flag.The Engineered to Outrun leaderboard celebrates the most dynamic driver-engineer duos in Formula E—tracking those who gain the most positions during a race, with emphasis on overtaking prowess, energy management, and overall race pace. The season concludes with an award for the top-ranked pairing.After Round 5 in Miami, the leaderboard has Maserati MSG Racing’s Stoffel Vandoorne and his race engineer Thibault Arnal on number 2. Mahindra Racing’s Nyck De Vries and race engineer Tom Bayles are in third position in the ABB Engineered to Outrun leaderboard.The FIA Formula E Instagram account also shared the update, posting:“@nico.mueller51 overtaking his way up the rankings! With a mega drive from P18 to P4, the @andrettife driver tops the @abbgroup Engineered to Outrun leaderboard after Round 5. #MiamiEPrix #FormulaE #Motorsport #Racing.”Nico Mueller’s rise was the result of strategy combined with fortunate timing. While many drivers delayed activating Attack Mode until later in the race, Mueller opted for a more aggressive strategy—using two four-minute activations, starting with the first on Lap 11 to position himself within points range.By Lap 20, Mueller was running in 10th when a red flag was brought out following a three-car collision. After the restart, as the majority of the grid scrambled to use their remaining Attack Mode activations, Mueller’s earlier strategy gave him an edge.Despite finishing 10th on the road, he was ultimately classified 4th after multiple post-race penalties were issued. Drivers including Norman Nato, Robin Frijns, Oliver Rowland, Sam Bird, and Taylor Barnard were penalized 10 seconds each for misuse of Attack Mode, while Nick Cassidy received a five-second penalty for exceeding track limits.Also Read: Formula E Miami E-Prix 2025: Jake Hughes crashes at chicane, here’s how the multi-car collision changed the outcome.

Formula E is now in its 11th season since its debut in 2014, and the electric motorsport has achieved impressive success, carving its own identity despite the dominance of Formula 1. One of the key indicators of this success is the growing grid of 11 teams and 22 drivers—one more than the 10 teams in F1. While drivers like Oliver Rowland and Pascal Wehrlein have previously tested their skills in F1, it seems they've found their true calling in the more sustainable and rapidly evolving Formula E.Oliver Rowland is currently leading the Formula E standings with 68 points, thanks to his victory at this season’s Mexico City E-Prix. Rowland had a brief stint with F1 team Williams in 2018 before transitioning to Formula E, where he raced for Mahindra Racing and then Nissan, ultimately making a name for himself with the Japanese team. Antonio Felix da Costa, driving for Porsche, is also a formidable force in the series. He currently sits in third place with 39 points this season, continuing to prove his prowess on the track.Maximilian Günther has made a strong impression after his move from Maserati MSG Racing to DS Penske. At the Jeddah E-Prix, Günther took pole position, posted the fastest lap, and ultimately clinched the victory. With this standout performance, he’s now eyeing an even higher position, currently sitting fourth in the driver standings.German driver Pascal Wehrlein, another former F1 racer, began his Formula E career with Mahindra Racing before joining Tag Heuer Porsche. After winning the Formula E World Championship last season, Wehrlein has maintained his strong form, registering the fastest lap in two races this season—at the São Paulo and Mexico City E-Prix. He’s currently in eighth place with 25 points but remains a serious contender with 7 career wins and 6 pole positions to his name.Mitch Evans, a consistent presence with Jaguar TCS Racing since 2016, continues to be among the best drivers in Formula E. He secured a win for Jaguar at the São Paulo E-Prix in December, propelling him to seventh in the standings with 25 points, keeping him in the mix for the championship.At just 20 years old, Taylor Barnard is quickly establishing himself as one of the brightest young talents in Formula E.

Japan beat Canada to qualify for finals

Tokyo:

Pune: For Indian women’s tennis team captain Vishaal Uppal , it was “mission accomplished” after his team secured their World Group Playoff berth in the Billie Jean King Cup .“At the start, I sent the team a message saying our mission is Project Playoff. And it’s mission accomplished,” Uppal said on Saturday after India beat South Korea 2-1 in their last round-robin match to finish in the top two in Asia-Oceania Group 1 .“We have just proven when we become ‘We’, what we can achieve. It’s truly amazing. I know I was tough on them this week. I pushed them. But we had Project Playoff. It was a team effort,” said the former Davis Cupper.Shrivalli Rashmikaa played a stellar role as she won all her five singles matches, but Uppal emphasised on the team bonding, which he said played a vital role in lifting the Hyderabad girl’s performance. “She beat a lot of higher ranked players this week,” he said.“We’re playing a team competition, and for her to come out and perform like that, I think the credit has to go to the entire team,” he said. “When Shrivalli beat (Hong Yi) Cody Wong (of Hong Kong) the other day and Ankita ran on to the court and hugged her. That says a lot.” Ankita Raina played her part in the team’s success, combining with fellow senior Prarthana Thombare , to clinch the decisive doubles rubber against Korea. “It was deja-vu for me. When it became one-all against Korea, I remembered the mindset I had in Dubai for doubles, and tried to keep that momentum,” she said, referring to the last time India advanced to the playoffs in 2020.“And we were aggressive because as we all know that in doubles, the momentum can change quickly,” she said, adding, “We really came together. We are traveling and playing by ourselves, but there’s this one week every year when we come together as a team.”Prarthana, Asian Games doubles bronze medallist with Sania Mirza in 2014, hit the winning shot — a sizzling forehand service return down the line. And she was modest about it all.“Sahaja (Yamalapalli) and Shrivalli were fighting their hearts out. And it gives us the confidence,” the 30-year-old from Barshi said. “As much as it is ours, it is each and every person who wants to play tennis. It’s their win as well.”Ena Shibahara and Shuko Aoyama defeated Kayla Cross and Rebecca Marino 6-3, 5-7, 6-2 in the decisive doubles match to secure Japan a spot in the Billie Jean King Cup Finals on Sunday.The BJK Cup Finals will be played in Shenzhen in September.","India beat South Korea 2-1 in their last round-robin match to finish in the top two in Asia-Oceania Group 1.

Alcaraz wins

Monte Carlo Masters

Carlos Alcaraz had an outstanding start to his clay-court season last week, clinching the Monte Carlo title on Sunday for the first time in his career.After missing this Masters 1000 event last year, he earned the full 1,000 ranking points when he beat Lorenzo Musetti in the final, elevating his total from 6,720 to 7,720 points.As a result, Alcaraz moves one place in the latest ATP rankings (April1 4), moving up from No. 3 to No. 2, surpassing Alexander Zverev, who lost his first match in Monte Carlo this year. Zverev’s ranking points drop from 7,645 to 7,595, causing him to fall one place.This marks Alcaraz's first return to the Top 2 since October 28 last year, when he was also ranked No. 2; he had spent 23 consecutive weeks at No. 3 since then. Overall, this is his 89th week in the Top 2, with 36 weeks at No. 1 and 53 weeks at No. 2.Alcaraz also narrows the gap between him and current No. 1 Jannik Sinner, who is suspended presently, from 3,610 points (10,330 to 6,720) to 2,210 points (9,930 to 7,720).Sinner missed Monte Carlo while defending semi-final points as he serves a three-month suspension for two failed dope tests last year. Although Alcaraz can’t overtake him before Sinner returns on the tour in Rome, winning both Barcelona and Madrid in the coming weeks could reduce that gap to just 720 points, putting the No. 1 ranking within reach in Italy.In addition to Alcaraz and Zverev's place swap, there was movement elsewhere in the ATP Top 10: Alex de Minaur made the biggest jump, climbing from No. 10 to No. 7 — just one spot shy of his career-high of No. 6 — after reaching the semifinals of his second Masters 1000 event.Andrey Rublev also rose from No. 9 back to No. 8, while Daniil Medvedev returned to the Top 10 after being outside for two weeks, moving from No. 11 to No. 9. This marked the 2021 US Open champion's first absence from the elite group in over two years, dating back to February 2023.Meanwhile, Musetti closed in on a Top 10 debut, climbing from No. 16 to No. 11 — surpassing his previous career - high of No. 15 — after reaching the finals of his first Masters 1000 event. He’s now just 15 points behind the No. 10-ranked Ruud, with scores of 3,215 to 3,200.""I'm just really happy to have won Monte Carlo for the first time,"" Alcaraz said. ""It's been a really difficult week with a lot of difficult situations. I'm really proud of myself, how I've dealt with everything. It's been a really difficult month for me on the court and outside. Coming here and seeing how the whole hard work has paid off, I'm really happy.""This victory represents Alcaraz's first clay court success since his French Open triumph last season, with his only other clay court appearance resulting in a silver medal at the Paris Olympics.Musetti, appearing in his first Masters 1000 final after defeating top 10 players Stefanos Tsitsipas and Alex de Minaur, started strongly but faced physical challenges as the match progressed.The Italian received medical treatment for his right leg when trailing 0-3 in the final set, though he continued to play despite the injury.""It is not the way I would have wanted to win a match,"" Alcaraz said. ""Lorenzo's been through a really tough week, long and intense matches. I feel sorry for him, one of the best results he has done. To end like this is not easy. Hopefully it's not serious and he's 100 percent soon.""""It was probably one of my best tournaments so far,"" Musetti said, who won bronze at last year's Olympics behind Alcaraz and gold medalist Novak Djokovic. ""I'm disappointed I couldn't finish the match in the best way, for the crowd. You deserve it so I will keep going and try and come back for revenge.""The match began with Musetti dropping his opening service game but immediately breaking back and taking the first set, capitalising on Alcaraz's six unforced errors.Alcaraz's game improved significantly in the second set, which he won convincingly before completing the victory with a dominant final set.Both players will continue their clay court preparations at the Barcelona Open next week as they build toward the French Open at the end of May.","Carlos Alcaraz won the Monte Carlo Masters for the first time in his career.

Carlos Alcaraz captured his first Monte Carlo Masters title on Sunday with a commanding 3-6, 6-1, 6-0 win over Italy’s Lorenzo Musetti , marking his sixth Masters 1000 crown and most significant title since Wimbledon 2024.The 21-year-old Spaniard, a four-time Grand Slam champion, overcame a slow start to dominate the final two sets, showcasing his trademark intensity and athleticism. Alcaraz had lost in the opening round on his only previous appearance at Monte Carlo in 2022 but returned stronger this year.“It’s been a really difficult week and a tough month for me, both on and off the court,” said Alcaraz. “I’m proud of how I dealt with everything.”Musetti, playing in his first Masters 1000 final, started brightly, rallying from an early break to take the opening set. However, the Italian began struggling with a leg issue early in the third set, requiring medical attention at 0-3. From that point, Alcaraz never looked back, sealing the decider without dropping a game.Despite the defeat, Musetti earned a rankings boost to World No. 11 and valuable experience ahead of the French Open . “It was probably one of my best tournaments so far,” he said. “I’m disappointed I couldn’t finish stronger, but I’ll come back for revenge.”Alcaraz will rise to World No. 2, overtaking Alexander Zverev, as the clay-court season intensifies. With Roland Garros on the horizon, his Monte Carlo triumph sets the tone for another strong title push.","Carlos Alcaraz wins first Monte Carlo Masters title.

Sitanshu Kotak press conference: Conversations between coach Gambhir, Virat and Rohit, and more

Poll Should Axar Patel be included in the ODI squad against New Zealand? Yes, he brings balance to the team. No, the current players should be given more chances.

NEW DELHI: Former India batter Kris Srikkanth has questioned India's team balance in ODIs, calling out the continued absence of Axar Patel at a time when Ravindra Jadeja 's form has dipped and the side is crying out for a reliable sixth bowling option. His remarks came after India's seven-wicket loss to New Zealand in Rajkot, where the visitors chased down 285 with ease to level the series 1-1.With Washington Sundar ruled out, Jadeja is currently India's only spin-bowling all-rounder in the XI. But Srikkanth felt the veteran looked short of answers. “Jadeja is one of my favourite players. But he does not seem to know what to do. He looks caught between attacking and giving the ball flight,” Srikkanth said on his YouTube channel. Jadeja returned wicketless figures of 0/44 from eight overs, unable to strike when India needed breakthroughs most.Srikkanth made a strong case for Axar Patel's inclusion, questioning the rigid template around all-rounders. “It is an open secret — why not bring Axar back? Why can't you play three spinners and three pacers? Is there a rule that the bowling all-rounder must be a medium pacer? It's impossible to replace Hardik Pandya.You can't. Axar would have been the ideal candidate today. The sixth bowler was missing,” he said.Highlighting Axar's big-tournament pedigree, Srikkanth added: “Axar has a terrific record. He did well in the Champions Trophy and won us the T20 World Cup. Suddenly, he is nowhere. Where is Axar Patel? The team is suffering at the end of the day.” Axar's ODI numbers back the claim—75 wickets in 66 innings at an economy of 4.49, along with 859 runs.Srikkanth also termed India's bowling “very ordinary” beyond the new-ball spells, pointing to the lack of flexibility when Nitish Kumar Reddy bowled just two overs. “There is no option of a sixth bowler at all,” he said, suggesting more tactical risk could have been taken when Kuldeep Yadav struggled for rhythm.India captain Shubman Gill , meanwhile, cited the failure to take wickets in the middle overs as the decisive factor. Despite early strikes, Daryl Mitchell (131) and Will Young (87) forged a match-winning partnership. Gill admitted India could have been “a little bit braver” during that phase and stressed the cost of missed chances, as KL Rahul's 112 went in vain.",Former India batter Kris Srikkanth has questioned India's team balance in ODIs.

NEW DELHI: New Zealand outplayed India on Indian conditions as Daryl Mitchell’s unbeaten 131 overshadowed KL Rahul’s fighting century to secure a seven-wicket win in the second ODI at the Niranjan Shah Stadium on Wednesday, levelling the three-match series 1-1.Chasing 285, the visitors finished at 286 for three in 47.3 overs, adapting better to the slow surface and executing their plans with greater clarity.India were kept to 284 for seven despite Rahul’s superb 112 not out off 91 balls.The Indian spinners struggled on a pitch offering grip, while New Zealand’s slower bowlers controlled the middle overs effectively.Debutant left-arm spinner Jayden Lennox impressed with figures of 1 for 42 from 10 overs, while Michael Bracewell chipped in with 1 for 34.In contrast, Kuldeep Yadav and Ravindra Jadeja conceded 126 runs from 18 overs for just one wicket.Mitchell and Will Young laid the foundation of the chase with a calm and controlled 162-run second-wicket stand off 152 balls.Young scored a fluent 87 off 98 balls, while Mitchell showcased his range with multiple sweep shots to register his third ODI hundred against India, finishing with 131 not out from 117 deliveries.A dropped catch by Prasidh Krishna when Mitchell was on 80 proved costly, allowing the New Zealand batter to take the game away.Earlier, India lost momentum after a steady start, slipping from 99 for one to 118 for four. Captain Shubman Gill scored 56 but fell to a mistimed pull, while Shreyas Iyer and Virat Kohli departed cheaply.Kohli was bowled for 23, playing on to an innocuous delivery. Rahul held the innings together with vital partnerships, including a 73-run stand with Ravindra Jadeja, who contributed 27.New Zealand also absorbed early pressure from Harshit Rana and Mohammed Siraj, with Rana removing Devon Conway.However, the visitors stayed composed to seal the chase comfortably.

Harshit Rana press conference: 'Team wants to groom me as an all-rounder'

NEW DELHI: India captain Shubman Gill admitted that his team failed to seize control in the crucial middle overs during their seven-wicket loss to New Zealand in the second ODI at the Niranjan Shah Stadium in Rajkot on Wednesday.Gill felt that the inability to pick up wickets during that phase made defending the total extremely difficult, even though India posted a competitive score.“We couldn't pick up any wickets in the middle overs. With five fielders in, if you don't keep taking wickets in the middle overs, it becomes very difficult, even if we had added 15-20 more runs. And if you don't pick up wickets in the middle overs, it's very difficult to stop a target,” Gill said at the post-match presentation.India finished on 284 for seven on a two-paced surface, with KL Rahul anchoring the innings with a composed 112 not out off 92 balls, his eighth ODI century. However, New Zealand chased the target comfortably, riding on Daryl Mitchell’s superb unbeaten 131. Mitchell also stitched together a decisive 162-run partnership off 152 balls for the third wicket with Will Young, who scored 87.Reflecting on the conditions and the importance of partnerships, Gill said, “On these kinds of wickets, as soon as you have a partnership, the set batsman has to make it big because it's not easy for the batsman coming in to score freely.”Gill acknowledged that India had made a strong start with the ball but failed to maintain pressure later in the innings. “In the end, we did get a decent target on the board, and we bowled exceptionally well in the first 10 overs. And the kind of start that we got in the bowling, we were trying to squeeze them down, put them under pressure, but I think they batted really well in the middle overs,” he added.The Indian captain also pointed out that the pitch became easier to bat on as the match progressed and felt his bowlers could have been braver. “In the first 10-15 overs that we bowled, the ball was doing a little bit. But I think after the 20-25 overs, the wicket may be settled in a little bit, but I think we could have been a little bit more brave while bowling in the middle overs. We could have taken a little bit more chances. ”Gill did not shy away from highlighting fielding lapses as another factor behind the defeat. “Even in the last match, we let down a couple of chances. It's one thing that we are always, especially with this team, we are always trying to get better at fielding. It's one aspect that we're always trying to get better at. And yes, if you don't take your chances, in this format, it always makes you lose,” he concluded.New Zealand captain Michael Bracewell praised his side’s all-round effort in levelling the series. “It is a complete performance from us, and I am proud of the team. We were very happy at the halfway point. We bowled very well. It was a typical Kiwi performance with the ball,” he said.Bracewell also lauded his team’s composure during the chase. “We were ready to chase anything, really. They bowled really well, and the way the guys adapted and soaked up the pressure was great. Daryl and Young then took the game away from India.”On Mitchell’s approach against Kuldeep Yadav and debutant Jayden Lennox’s role, Bracewell added, “The batters read the conditions really well. We pride ourselves on being adaptable and taking the game head-on. He (Jayden Lennox) bowled really well. It's never easy to make your debut in India. He bowled the tough overs.”","India captain Shubman Gill says his team failed to seize control in the crucial middle overs during their seven-wicket loss to New Zealand in the second ODI.

Poll What do you think about Ali Khan's Instagram post regarding the visa situation? It was an appropriate reaction It caused unnecessary speculation I have no opinion about it

NEW DELHI: A viral social media post by USA fast bowler Ali Khan sparked widespread speculation on Tuesday, with claims that India had denied visas to US cricketers of Pakistan origin ahead of the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup. However, officials familiar with the process have clarified that no visas have been formally rejected and that the matter remains part of a standard administrative review.Four US players of Pakistan origin — Ali Khan, Shayan Jahangir, Mohammad Mohsin and Ehsan Adil — are currently awaiting visa clearance after attending scheduled appointments at the Indian High Commission in Colombo on January 13. The players are in Sri Lanka with the USA squad as part of their final phase of preparation for the February tournament.As per a Cricbuzz report, according to sources at the ICC, all four players completed their paperwork exactly as instructed prior to the appointments. “They had the appointment this morning at the Indian Embassy in Sri Lanka. They completed the paperwork as per what ICC had asked them to prior to the appointments. At the appointment, the players were informed that the visas could not be processed at this stage,” the source said.“Later in the evening, USA management received a call from the Indian Embassy indicating that some of the required information had been received, while additional inputs were still awaited from the Foreign Ministry. Once that process is complete, they will be contacted to proceed further.”The Cricbuzz report further added that the officials have stressed that this does not constitute a visa denial. Instead, the applications are under review, a process that is routine in special-category cases involving players of Pakistani origin, irrespective of nationality or team affiliation. Similar procedures have applied in the past to international cricketers such as Moeen Ali, Shoaib Bashir and Usman Khawaja when travelling to India.The issue gained traction after Ali Khan posted an Instagram story reading, “India visa denied but KFC for the win,” which fuelled online speculation. However, sources close to the matter reiterated that the applications remain active and that such cases often require clearances from multiple departments, including final approval from India’s Ministry of External Affairs.Importantly, the same protocols apply across all participating teams. Squads from the UAE, Canada, Oman and Italy — all of which include players of Pakistani origin — are expected to follow identical procedures.Ali Khan, a Pakistan-born pacer who has represented the USA in 15 ODIs and 18 T20Is, was part of the squad that famously beat Pakistan at the 2024 T20 World Cup. While the USA are yet to announce their final squad for the 2026 tournament, he remains in contention.The T20 World Cup will be held from February 7 to May 8 across venues in India and Sri Lanka, with the USA placed in Group A alongside India, Pakistan, Namibia and the Netherlands. For now, officials insist the visa process is ongoing — not denied — and urge patience amid the growing buzz.","Four US players of Pakistan origin are currently awaiting visa clearance.

Poll Which aspect do you think has the greatest impact on an athlete's career? Talent Hard Work Opportunities Coaching

NEW DELHI: Ahead of the second ODI against New Zealand on Wednesday, India wicketkeeper-batter KL Rahul struck a powerful, reflective note while interacting with budding cricketers during the Men in Blue's training session in Vadodara. In a video shared by the BCCI , Rahul's words underlined patience, perseverance and readiness — themes that have shaped his own international journey.“It's not like you'll never get the opportunity. You'll be sitting outside for 2-3 years. If you don't get the opportunity in the state, then you'll get some other tournament to perform and show your skills and talent,” Rahul said, urging youngsters to trust the process rather than chase instant results.Emphasising self-discipline, the 33-year-old added, “You just have to constantly keep working on yourself and keep yourself ready. If you get a chance, you'll have to perform in such a way that you can't drop after that. But even in that, you'll have to enjoy the process. There's no other option for the player. That's all you have in your hands.”When asked about dealing with difficult phases, Rahul offered a candid response shaped by experience. “That phase is difficult for everyone. It's not like no player goes through that phase. He's always at the top.It won't happen with anyone. You'll get angry and frustrated. But you have to snap out of it. Don't give up. I'll do what I can. And when God gives me a chance, I'll use it,” he said.Reiterating the message, Rahul told the youngsters, “You will definitely get a chance to show your talent, whether it's in a domestic, international, or local tournament. You just have to work hard and be ready when your opportunity comes, and grab it with both your hands. As a cricketer, it's the only thing we can do.”","India wicketkeeper-batter KL Rahul spoke to budding cricketers. Rahul's words underlined patience, perseverance and readiness.

Sitanshu Kotak press conference: Conversations between coach Gambhir, Virat and Rohit, and more

Poll Which player do you believe is more crucial for India's ODI squad? Ravindra Jadeja Axar Patel Both equally

Opportunities on the bench

RAJKOT: It’s festive season in Ravindra Jadeja ’s hometown. The markets are teeming with locals preparing for Sankranti and the kite festival on Wednesday, the day of the second ODI. For Jadeja, though, it’s a different kind of hustle: holding on to the spot of India’s premier ODI spin-bowling allrounder ahead of Axar Patel Jadeja has been a constant during the optional training sessions on match eve. On Tuesday, his usual carefree demeanour took a back seat. He batted in the nets for close to an hour before bowling an extended spell. With the 2027 ODI World Cup about 20 months away, there is pressure on him to reestablish his credentials.TOI understands Axar Patel is currently the preferred choice for that tournament. He isn’t playing the ongoing ODI series because the selectors, it is learnt, want to preserve him for the upcoming T20I series in the lead-up to the T20 World Cup next month. Effectively, Jadeja is on trial to stay relevant in India’s ODI scheme of things. It’s also part of a wider plan: building a pool of backups for each position for 2027.The team management leans towards having a lefthanded batter in the middle order and also someone from the top order who can offer a few steady overs. That brought Ayush Badoni into the picture once Washington Sundar was injured in Vadodara on Sunday.If KL Rahul continues as the No. 1 wicketkeeper-batter over Rishabh Pant, it eventually becomes a shootout between Jadeja and Axar for the No.5 slot. Of late, Jadeja’s diminishing power-hitting hasn’t escaped the discerning eye.Axar’s rapid evolution as a batter had prompted the team management to push him up the order in the Champions Trophy when Jadeja was also in the XI on slow, turning pitches. Since the World Cup is slated to be played on South Africa’s pacier, bouncier pitches, there may be little scope to fit in both, with Hardik Pandya likely to come in and bat at No. 7.Batting coach Sitanshu Kotak refused to comment on where Jadeja stands in his white-ball career. Jadeja, though, couldn’t have asked for a better venue to regain his attacking touch than Rajkot.Kotak, however, asserted that Yashasvi Jaiswal and Ruturaj Gaikwad played in the last ODI series against South Africa only because Shubman Gill and Shreyas Iyer were not available. “The positive is that both of them got hundreds. But they will have to wait for their opportunities,” he said.There’s an underlying concern in the ranks: the decreasing number of ODIs played every year. As per the current schedule, India have only about 25 ODIs left before the World Cup. Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli play only one format and KL Rahul too is dependent on the format to keep his white-ball career going.“It’s very hard to convince the likes of Rohit, Kohli and Rahul to sit out. They will always argue that they get to play far and few between to build a rhythm. Prior to the home ODI season, it was discussed that Pant and Rahul will be rotated. Pant could have got a look-in this series if he didn’t get injured,” sources close to TOI said.“There are a lot of changes in the playing conditions for the ODI World Cup. Hopefully, we will get more ODIs after this T20 World Cup,” Kotak said.","Jadeja is on trial to stay relevant in India’s ODI scheme of things.

LONDON: Former England cricketer Stuart Broad rubbished the talks of the England men's team indulging in heavy drinking during their Ashes tour to Australia, saying that senior players are not ""party animals"" and just a ""couple of guys who made mistakes"" got viral across all media.England lost the Ashes Down Under by 4-1, snapping their 18-match winless streak in Australia at Melbourne, Joe Root's two centuries, which broke his Test ton duck in Australia and the rise of Jacob Bethell towards the back end of the series being the key positives.However, after the Ashes were lost during the Adelaide Test, a few clips of opener Ben Duckett seemingly drunk and Jacob Bethell partying went viral on social media, which seemed to be coming from their trip to Noosa after the loss at Brisbane in the second Test. The pictures did not go down well with several English fans, and players were trolled for their off-field indulgences.Speaking on the For the Love of Cricket podcast with co-host and star batter Jos Buttler, Broad said, ""I look at this England team, they are not drinking. I have seen loads of things about a drinking culture, but there is not one. (Zak) Crawley, (Ollie) Pope, (Ben) Stokes, (Joe) Root, they are not really drinkers.They are not party animals.""Broad said it was just a couple of guys making mistakes and them surfacing in the media, and it is upto the teammates to get their players out of such situations.""And that is when your culture is really strong,"" he added.Ahead of the fourth Test, England team's managing director Rob Key had said that he would examine what actually happened during the break and decide whether any action was needed.""If there are things where people are saying that our players went out and drank excessively, then of course we will be looking into that,"" Key said, as quoted from ESPNcricinfo.""Drinking excessive amounts of alcohol for an international cricket team is not something that I would expect to see at any stage, and it would be a fault not to look into what happened there. But from everything that I have heard so far, they were very well behaved,"" he noted.""I have read what has been written in the last day or so, and if it goes into where they are drinking lots and it is a stag do, all that type of stuff, that's completely unacceptable. I am not a drinker. I think a drinking culture does not help anyone in any stretch whatsoever,"" he added.","England lost the Ashes Down Under by 4-1, snapping their 18-match winless streak in Australia.

India vs New Zealand: 'Ravindra Jadeja needs to look at his form or...'

Inter-College tournament to be named after Vengsarkar

MUMBAI: In a landmark move, the Mumbai Cricket Association (MCA) has decided to introduce central contracts for Mumbai’s domestic players from the 2026-27 season. The decision was taken during the MCA Apex Council meeting held at the association’s BKC facility on Wednesday.While the BCCI has long had a central contract system for India’s top cricketers, the MCA has now become one of the first state associations in the country to extend similar security to its own domestic players. The initiative is aimed at providing financial stability to those who do not represent India or feature in the IPL.“The MCA's central contracts will be given to the players exclusively for the domestic players, and not those who are playing for India and in the IPL. They will be given to around 15-20 Mumbai cricketers. The details of the contracts will be worked out before the next domestic season by the Mumbai senior selection committee,” a source in the MCA told TOI.The move builds on previous efforts by the MCA to strengthen domestic cricket. On March 23, 2024, the association announced a 100% pay hike for Ranji Trophy players to promote red-ball cricket. Under that decision, the MCA agreed to pay its Ranji players a match fee equal to what the BCCI pays, in addition to the BCCI’s existing payments, starting from the 2024-25 domestic season.Interestingly, the idea of central contracts is not entirely new at the MCA. On June 29, 2022, then MCA president Vijay Patil had announced plans to introduce central contracts for the 2022-23 season following an Apex Council meeting. However, the proposal remained pending for nearly three years before finally being cleared now.In another key development, the MCA has decided to introduce an Inter-College cricket tournament named after former India and Mumbai captain Dilip Vengsarkar “Our vision is to create a robust pathway from college cricket to the highest levels of the game. Naming the Inter-College Tournament after Dilip Vengsarkar reflects the values of excellence and leadership that we want young cricketers to aspire to. Central contracts are a step towards empowering players with stability and confidence, while the T20 scouting tournament will ensure that Mumbai continues to identify and nurture talent suited for the future of the game,” MCA president Ajinkya Naik said.“Celebrating excellence, leadership and the enduring legacy of Mumbai cricket. The tournament will serve as a vital platform for nurturing young talent at the collegiate level,” the MCA added.Vengsarkar, a former India chief selector, had earlier criticised Mumbai University for the “poor handling of the inter-collegiate cricket tournament” and had urged the MCA to take over the event.The MCA also announced plans to launch a “dedicated T20 Scouting Tournament”.“In keeping with the evolving demands of modern cricket, a T20 tournament will be conducted as a dedicated scouting platform for the T20 Mumbai League, creating a clear and merit-based pathway for young players to progress to elite competitive levels,” the MCA stated.",MCA to introduce central contracts for Mumbai's domestic players from 2026-27 season.

KL Rahul press conference: On Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma return, role of Ruturaj Gaikwad and more

NEW DELHI: India batter KL Rahul reached a major milestone with an unbeaten century against New Zealand in the second ODI of the series at the Niranjan Shah Stadium in Rajkot on Wednesday. Rahul became the first Indian wicketkeeper to score an ODI hundred against New Zealand and the first Indian batter to score an ODI century at this venue.Rahul brought up his eighth ODI hundred in the 49th over by hitting Kyle Jamieson ’s full toss for a six. He reached the landmark in 87 balls and remained not out on 112, scoring 11 fours and one six.Batting at No. 5, Rahul began cautiously and did not score off his first six deliveries. He opened his account on the seventh ball. Soon after, India lost Virat Kohli, who was dismissed for 23.With India under pressure, Rahul added 73 runs with Ravindra Jadeja , who scored 27. After Jadeja’s dismissal, Rahul continued to anchor the innings with Nitish Kumar Reddy at the other end. India finished on 284 for seven, setting New Zealand a target of 285.Rahul’s approach through the series has stood out. He has handled different match situations, whether rebuilding after early wickets or batting through the innings.His ODI average of over 93 against New Zealand reflects his consistency against the opposition. His role in the middle overs again proved key on Wednesday.In the first ODI at Vadodara, Rahul played a short but important innings, scoring 29 off 21 balls with two fours and a six. He sealed the chase by hitting two fours and a six in the 49th over as India won by four wickets.Earlier on Wednesday, New Zealand captain Michael Bracewell won the toss and chose to bowl first in the second ODI. India had taken a 1-0 lead in the three-match series with their win in Vadodara. The third ODI will be played in Indore on Sunday.Both teams made one change. Left-arm spin all-rounder Jayden Lennox came in for New Zealand, while wrist spinner Adithya Ashok was left out.India were forced into a change after Washington Sundar suffered a rib injury in the first ODI and was ruled out of the series. Batter Ayush Badoni was added to the squad for the remaining matches, and all-rounder Nitish Reddy replaced Sundar in the playing XI.","KL Rahul becomes first Indian wicketkeeper to score an ODI hundred against New Zealand.

Sitanshu Kotak press conference: Conversations between coach Gambhir, Virat and Rohit, and more

MUMBAI: Out of form and without a half-century in 2025, India’s T20 captain Suryakumar Yadav has received a strong vote of confidence from not only the national selectors but also former India off-spin great Harbhajan Singh.Suryakumar has managed 218 runs in 19 T20I innings this year, averaging 13.62 with a strike rate of 123.16. However, Harbhajan, who claimed 417 wickets in 103 Tests, continues to rate the 35-year-old as the “No 1 player in T20Is” and has backed the Mumbai batter “to come good for India in the World Cup.” Suryakkumar last registered a T20I fifty in October 2024, when he struck 75 against Bangladesh in Hyderabad.“Maybe, he is saving it for the World Cup. Surya is a class player. There is no doubt about it. I still believe that he is probably the No.1 player in this format. People often talk about how great AB de Villiers is, but we have our own guy who does the same job. And I do back him to come good for India in this World Cup. Not just as a captain, but as a batter. I am hoping for some big runs from him,” Harbhajan said at an event on Wednesday.A member of India’s World Cup-winning squads in 2007 and 2011 under MS Dhoni, Harbhajan expressed confidence that India can defend their T20 World Cup title when the tournament begins next month in India and Sri Lanka.On the pressure of playing a World Cup at home, Harbhajan said, “Playing international cricket itself is a pressure. It doesn't matter where you play. It’s kind of a blessing to play in front of your home crowd, in your backyard. You know your condition better than the others, and the support you get is unbelievable.”He added, “I think this team has got everything… They are match-winners. We hope that this trophy will (stay) in India. (If it happens) it will be the first time that the Indian team would win the trophy twice in a row (in 2024 and 2026). It will be fun.”Harbhajan also disagreed with Sanjay Manjrekar’s recent remark that Virat Kohli had chosen “the easiest format to play.”“If it was so easy to score runs in any format, then everyone would have made it. Let’s just enjoy what people are doing. They are playing well, winning games, scoring runs, and taking wickets. That's all that matters. It doesn't matter who plays which format. Virat, whether he plays in one format or all formats, has been a fantastic player and a big time match winner for India,” Harbhajan said, praising Kohli’s impact across formats.The former spinner also lamented the lack of quality off-spinners in Indian cricket, calling the art “old-fashioned” and stressing the need for specialists to emerge from domestic cricket.","Suryakumar Yadav has managed 218 runs in 19 T20I innings this year, averaging 13.62.

'Get ready for a bigger and better ILT20': Ashish Sehgal

Season 4 of the ILT20 represented a meaningful stride in the league’s regional growth plans, as players from Kuwait and Saudi Arabia were picked at the tournament’s first-ever auction and went on to feature across all six franchises.Every team signed at least one player from each country, giving emerging cricketers a rare chance to train, compete and share dressing rooms with some of the biggest names in world cricket.The season came to a close on January 4, when Desert Vipers defeated MI Emirates to lift their maiden ILT20 title.Throughout the tournament, players from Kuwait reflected on the experience and what it meant to work alongside established international stars.Kuwait national team captain Mohamed Aslam, who represented Sharjah Warriorz, spoke about the learning curve that came with the opportunity. “It’s a great opportunity for me to represent Sharjah Warriorz in the ILT20, and we are getting a lot of experience in the dressing room,” Aslam said.“As the captain of the Kuwait national team, I am sharing the dressing room with leaders like Tim Southee and Sikandar Raza. I have gotten a lot of information from them and learned many things by asking questions.As an associate cricket player, this is a very good opportunity. I hope to apply all of this in Kuwait and do our best.”Mohammed Shafeeq made history by becoming the first player from Kuwait or Saudi Arabia to appear in an ILT20 match when he took the field for MI Emirates against Dubai Capitals. Looking back on that moment, he highlighted the role played by the support staff.“The support from the coaching staff has been amazing because this is a completely different feeling for us. It will help us in the future, as the coaches are always watching us and giving technical inputs,” he said.“It is a very big moment for me to be part of this team and to play alongside players like Kieron Pollard, Nicholas Pooran and Jonny Bairstow. All of them are top players and operate at different levels. They consider us for every match, and that means a lot to me.”Dubai Capitals’ Anudeep Chenthamara also underlined how valuable the exposure had been. “I would like to thank the Kuwait Cricket Board and ILT20 for giving me this opportunity, it is a big one for me and the whole team,” he said.“There has been a lot of experience and learning over here. We have worked with experienced players and coaches; I have been able to work on many things from the basics to the higher level. For example, I have changed the base of my run-up.”Gulf Giants batter Meet Bhavsar, who has represented Kuwait in 73 T20Is, echoed similar sentiments about the benefits of competing in such an environment. “It’s been a great experience to share the dressing room with the superstars of modern-day cricket,” Bhavsar said.“Facing somebody like Tabraiz Shamsi in the nets has been really challenging and helped me immensely. I will try to share as much as I can with the rest of the Kuwait team, and I am grateful for the chance to be here.”From the championship-winning Desert Vipers camp, Bilal Tahir spoke about the daily learning that came with being part of the squad. “We are learning a lot every day. We have very good coaches, a great environment, and the style of teaching really helps us improve,” he said.“Playing with these stars is a dream for us because they are legends, and we learn so much from them. Just the other day in the nets, Fakhar Zaman told me how to improve certain things. I am very thankful to the Desert Vipers for giving us this opportunity.”Abu Dhabi Knight Riders’ Adnan Idrees also highlighted the value of sharing space with elite players. “It’s a great experience and I’m really enjoying my time here. Learning from legends is always a blessing, and sharing the dressing room with players like Andre Russell, Jason Holder, Phil Salt and Liam Livingstone makes me feel my game will improve a lot,” he said.“I keep getting tips from them about staying focused on my game, and I’ve learned a lot already. They are gems as people and as cricketers, and it’s a joy to share the dressing room with them. I feel blessed to be part of the ILT20 and hope more players get the chance to come here.”","Players from Kuwait and Saudi Arabia were picked at the tournament's first-ever auction.

Jay Shah’s 2036 Olympic blueprint for India: '8 Medals won’t cut it'

MADRID: Real Madrid fell to a shock 3-2 defeat in the Copa del Rey last 16 on Wednesday as Alvaro Arbeloa's debut as coach ended in humiliation by second-tier opposition.Appointed on Monday to replace Xabi Alonso, Arbeloa and his side were ousted by Jefte Betancor's stoppage-time winner at the Carlos Belmonte stadium.Without French superstar Kylian Mbappe and various other key players, Arbeloa's side struggled against a side currently 17th in Spain's second division.Albacete took the lead through Javi Villar but Franco Mastantuono equalised just before half-time.Jefte put the hosts back ahead after 82 minutes and then scored the winner after Gonzalo Garcia's 91st-minute goal looked to have forced extra time for the 15-time European champions.""Here at this club a draw is already bad -- it's a tragedy. Imagine a defeat like this, it's painful,"" Arbeloa told reporters.""I'm sure all our fans feel the same way. Even more so when it happens against a team from a lower division, although we already know here how tough any opponent can be.""If anyone is responsible and to blame for this outcome, it's clearly me, the one who made the decisions regarding the line-up, how we wanted to play, the substitutions.""I can only thank the players for the way they welcomed me, for the effort they put in today.""After Madrid lost the Spanish Super Cup final on Sunday against rivals Barcelona, President Florentino Perez replaced Alonso with reserve team coach Arbeloa.The Spaniard selected two players currently playing in the reserves he led until Monday -- holding midfielder Jorge Cestero and right-back David Jimenez.As well as Mbappe he left out players including goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois and Jude Bellingham, to rest ahead of the return to La Liga action on Saturday against Levante.""I'd do the same again, I brought a team capable of winning,"" said Arbeloa.The first half was mostly played under heavy gloom, not just Madrid's mood but an intense fog which set in a few minutes into the game.Vinicius Junior smashed high and wide from long range as neither side produced any clear chances until shortly before half-time when the hosts took a shock lead.Villar escaped Mastantuono's attentions at a corner and nodded Albacete in front after 42 minutes.Arbeloa's side levelled before the breakthrough, also capitalising on a corner, with Mastantuono turning home from close range.- Jefte's double -Albacete frustrated Madrid after the break and then burst into life in attack to take the lead once more.Andriy Lunin pushed away an effort from Riki but shortly afterwards Jefte put Alberto Gonzalez's side ahead.Gonzalo Garcia's clearance fell to the striker in the box and he fired down into the ground with ball bouncing up and flashing past Lunin.Madrid's young forward made amends by pulling his team level in stoppage time with a well-placed header.However, there was a sting in the tale as Jefte produced a sensational lofted finish past Lunin to snatch a famous late victory for Albacete, their first ever against Real Madrid.""I'm not afraid of failure, I can understand that someone would want to call this defeat that,"" added Arbeloa.""Failure is on the path to success, for me they are not in opposite directions.""Madrid captain Dani Carvajal, who came on as a substitute and could not stop Jefte's winner, said the players would work hard to revert the club's slump.""We're not at our best moment, we have to work hard, we all have to give a lot more, it's a reality,"" Carvajal told reporters.""We ask for forgiveness for the fans. We were not up to the level of this club, me first of all, and we will give our lives in the next games and months (to turn it around).""Elsewhere Real Betis beat Elche 2-1 and Alaves defeated Rayo Vallecano 2-0 to reach the quarter-finals.Holders Barcelona visit second division leaders Racing Santander on Thursday.",Real Madrid lose 3-2 to Albacete in the Copa del Rey last 16 on Wednesday.

NEW DELHI: The All India Football Federation (AIFF) has laid out an extensive 21-year plan to develop Indian football, which includes reflecting the best footballing practices from around the world through a global governing structure for club leagues in India.The charter, shared with the 14 Indian Super League (ISL) clubs on Tuesday, establishes two powerful bodies — a Governing Council and a Management Committee — to oversee the regulatory and operational functioning of the ISL and I-League.The Governing Council will be the highest authority overseeing the success of the ISL and I-League. This 22-member body serves as the league’s highest supervisor. It includes all 14 ISL club owners, three AIFF office bearers, and two independent experts with no commercial ties to the sport. Meeting once a year, this council will hold the final say on finances and major policy shifts.The Management Committee will be responsible for managing the day-to-day operations of each league with a focus on executing the league's visions outlined by the Governing Council, as well as developing new revenue streams.Chaired by the AIFF secretary-general, this 11-member group focuses on the ""smooth functioning"" of the league. It features a rotational lineup of five ISL club CEOs — including those from the previous season’s winners and runners-up — alongside AIFF officials and commercial partners.""It's a roadmap for the next 21 years about how the country's top two leagues are going to be managed, administrated, promoted and developed by these two bodies.""We have taken references from some of the top leagues of the world and proposed to implement the global best practices into India's top two football leagues,"" AIFF president Kalyan Chaubey told PTI.As part of the AIFF's efforts to solidify long-term partnerships, they are reserving 3 seats in both the Governing Council and Management Committees for ""potential commercial rights partners,"" indicating their willingness to explore new partnership opportunities.""We have done a thorough study on how some of the best football leagues are run, we have followed their structures before framing these policies,"" Chaubey said.","The All India Football Federation (AIFF) has laid out an extensive 21-year plan to develop Indian football.

Losing the dressing-room

Impatience of Real Madrid

What happens now

In May last year, when the coronation of Xabi Alonso as the new Real Madrid manager was taking place, his friend and former Liverpool teammate Luis Garcia said something which sounds prophetic now. In a podcast, Garcia said: “Xabi is a great coach but he needs players for his system that the Real Madrid board might not agree to give him. It’s going to be difficult for him.”To start with, Alonso, superb holding midfielder of fine pedigree during his time, wanted a player of the profile of Martin Zubimendi — a Spaniard whom Alonso had himself nurtured during his Real Sociedad B coaching days. Real, since the departure of Toni Kroos and Luka Modric were sorely lacking control in the midfield — but the board was not ready to shell out the money for Zubimendi. The Spaniard moved to Arsenal and the Gunners are looking the best team in Europe at the moment.Over the next seven months that Alonso was in charge, the midfield was an area that kept bothering him. But the results weren’t disastrous, Real have seen much worse.Halfway through the season, they are four points off the top in the Liga and look poised to make the top-8 of Champions League — something they couldn’t manage last year under Carlo Ancelotti.Barring that 2-5 mauling to Atletico Madrid in the Liga, one-goal defeats against Manchester City, Liverpool and Barcelona are par for the course. And let’s not forget, Alonso did win the first Liga Clasico.Even on Sunday in the Super Cup final against Barca, Real were in the game till the last minute. But there was a telling moment after the match which probably indicated that Alonso had lost the dressing-room.As the much-respected 44-year-old urged his players to give Barcelona players the guard of honour as they took the podium, Kylian Mbappe told his teammates not to do so. And the players ignored their coach and followed the star.This wasn’t the first time when a coach’s orders were questioned in public. During the Liga Clasico, as Alonso replaced Vinicius Junior with 10 minutes for the final whistle at the Bernabeu, the Brazilian left the ground fuming, straight to the dressing room, without acknowledging his coach. The temperamental winger did apologise on X later, but there was no mention of Alonso, whom he had disrespected. Those who follow Spanish football closely felt that the fact there was no pressure from the Real Madrid board on Vinicius to be more humble in his apology was a clear indication that things were turning against the coach.Alonso, son of a football coach and greatly influenced by the legendary Pep Guardiola, believes that attackers need to press and contribute in defence, something that the likes of Vinicius refuse to do.The Spanish tactician, who made Bayer Leverkusen the ‘invincible’ champions of Bundesliga in 2024 from being relegation strugglers, was constantly up against it at Real with the stars calling the shots. Midfield stalwarts Federico Valverde and Jude Bellingham, too, were reportedly not on his side, and Alonso increasingly cut a lonely figure in the dug-out, a sharp contrast to the feisty coach at the Leverkusen touchline and revered by one and all inside the BayArena.While scrutiny became his constant companion in Madrid, it was manageable till the results came — 13 wins out of the first 14 in all competitions. But the November injuries followed and the inevitable one-month slump, where Madrid lost nine points in five games forgoing the Liga lead to Barca, all hell broke loose.Just after Alonso had taken over and Real lost the Club World Cup semifinal to PSG 0-4 in July, the victorious Luis Enrique had expressed optimism for his opposite number.“Xabi is planning a project and it will take time. It can’t happen overnight,” Enrique had said. The biggest problem with anything around Real is that there is no time. That’s probably the reason a successful coach for the 15-time Champions League winners is invariably more a ‘manager of egos’ than a ‘man of ideas’. Their three most successful since 2000 — Vicente Del Bosque, Zinedine Zidane and Ancelotti — didn’t bring anything new to world football, but they did manage superstars well.Alvaro Arbeloa, the new manager at Real Madrid, is a close friend of Alonso’s during his playing days and who too joined the Los Blancos from Liverpool in the same year, 2009. But they are different characters. While Alonso’s feistiness was all on the field, Arbeloa, a successful full-back for club and country, exudes a swaggering cockiness that is a part and parcel of the Real Madrid ethos.A respected figure in the Real ranks, he has been coaching the Real junior teams since 2020, winning a domestic treble in 2022 with the U19 team for the first time. But coaching Mbappe and Co. is a different ball game and Arbeloa — a favourite of Jose Mourinho during his Real Madrid days — would know that. All-conquering success at Real looks a far cry for now, and if Arbeloa can keep the team competitive till the end of the season, it could earn him a longer rope.Else, the whispers carrying Juergen Klopp’s name could get louder around the mazy corridors of the swanky Santiago Bernabeu.","Xabi Alonso has lost the dressing-room at Real Madrid, says Raunak Sadhwani. Former Liverpool teammate Luis Garcia said it was going to be difficult for the Spaniard when he was appointed as the new Real Madrid manager in May last year. The board was not ready to shell out the money for Martin Zubimendi, who moved to Arsenal.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126517586,imgsize-93362,width-400,resizemode-4/real-madrid.jpg"

Jay Shah’s 2036 Olympic blueprint for India: '8 Medals won’t cut it'

MANCHESTER: Manchester United have turned to former player Michael Carrick to salvage their imploding season.Carrick was hired Tuesday as head coach until the end of the season after Ruben Amorim was fired last week.The former England midfielder won five Premier League titles and the Champions League during a trophy-laden playing career at Old Trafford. He was also an assistant coach at United and had an unbeaten three-game spell as interim manager when Ole Gunnar Solskjaer was fired in 2021.On this occasion, Carrick was selected ahead of Solskjaer, who was also interviewed for the role.“I know what it takes to succeed here; my focus is now on helping the players to reach the standards that we expect at this incredible club, which we know that this group is more than capable of producing,” he said.By appointing Carrick on a temporary basis, United are giving itself time to find a long-term replacement for Amorim, who became the sixth permanent manager or coach to be discarded by the storied club after more than a decade of decline since Alex Ferguson retired in 2013.It is possible Carrick could put himself in contention if he impresses during the 17 remaining games this season. And while he has only initially been appointed for the short-term, it was notable that United did not describe him as interim when announcing his contract.Carrick’s prioritiesCarrick’s only full-time managerial experience was at second-tier Middlesbrough from 2022-25, where his reign ended after failing to secure promotion to the Premier League.Former England assistant Steve Holland will be part of his coaching team at United.Carrick's first two games are tough ones — at home to second-place Manchester City in the league on Saturday and away to first-place Arsenal the following weekend.In his previous spell at United, he oversaw wins against Arsenal and Villarreal as well as a draw at Chelsea.His priority is to secure Champions League qualification after defeat to Brighton in the third round of the FA Cup on Sunday put the 20-time English champion on course for another trophyless season after ending up empty-handed last term.United, which were knocked out of the English League Cup by fourth-tier Grimsby, is seventh in the Premier League, but Carrick said he had “total belief” in the players.“There is still a lot to fight for this season, we are ready to pull everyone together and give the fans the performances that their loyal support deserves,” he said.As well as Carrick and Solskjaer, other former United players Darren Fletcher and Ruud van Nistelrooy were considered for the role. Fletcher took charge of United’s two games following Amorim’s departure — a draw at Burnley in the league and the loss to Brighton. He is expected to return to his role as youth coach.After FergusonAmorim was the latest to fail to lead United back to the summit of English soccer in the post-Ferguson era after David Moyes, Louis van Gaal, Jose Mourinho, Solskjaer and Erik ten Hag.Carrick was part of one of Ferguson’s greatest teams, which won a Premier League and Champions League double in 2008. In all he won 12 major trophies in 12 years at United.He was in United's last Premier League title winning team in Ferguson's final season.“Michael is an excellent coach and knows exactly what it takes to win at Manchester United,"" said United director of football Jason Wilcox, who led the search for Amorim's replacement. “He is ready to lead our talented and determined group of players for the remainder of the season as we continue to build the club towards regular and sustained success.”",Michael Carrick appointed Manchester United head coach until end of season. Carrick replaces Ruben Amorim who was fired last week. The former England midfielder won five Premier League titles and the Champions League during a trophy-laden playing career at Old Trafford.

PARIS: Former Marseille coach Rolland Courbis, a charismatic figure of French soccer who later became a prominent pundit, has died, his employer said on Monday. He was 72.RMC radio did not disclose the cause of the death in a statement released in agreement with Courbis' family.Born in Marseille, Courbis came through the club's academy. A rugged defender, he was part of the team that won the French league and cup double in 1972 and returned to the club in the late 1990s as coach.As a player, he also won two French league titles and a French Cup with Monaco.""A Marseillais at heart, he embodied popular, dynamic football. His unmistakable accent carried his frank, direct, often passionate and always sincere words,"" Marseille said in a tribute.Courbis enjoyed a much-traveled coaching career, with spells in France and abroad, notably at Bordeaux, Lens, Montpellier and the USM Alger.Among the many defining moments of his career was a stunning comeback he oversaw when coaching Marseille. His team found itself 4-0 down at home to Montpellier in 1998 but fought back to seal a remarkable 5-4 victory.Courbis, who had a taste for casino gambling and lived with an Italian countess for a while, led a tumultuous life.He was seriously wounded in 1996 when gunmen fatally shot the president of a French soccer team outside a stadium following a game. Courbis, who was also involved in several legal cases and sentenced to prison, was hit by a bullet during the attack.France coach Didier Deschamps said that with his passing, French soccer lost ""a fine connoisseur of football and its inner workings, but also of the game itself.""""He was a true passionate figure,"" Deschamps added. ""And in recent years, he chose to pass on that passion behind a microphone, with a turn of phrase all his own.""Since 2005, he had become a consultant on RMC, where he commented on football news.""His passion came through in his trademark Marseille accent and in a very direct rapport with listeners,"" RMC said. ""A freedom of tone that kept the language of the supporters, while sharing their questions and emotions. He was particularly successful in remaining approachable and warm, while still being demanding on substance.""","Former Marseille coach Rolland Courbis has died, his employer says. He was 72.

GM Raunak Sadhwani Exclusive: Becoming Grandmaster at 13, hidden costs of the game, and more #chess

It was already a bruising night for Manchester United and their captain. Hours after the club's FA Cup journey ended with a 2–1 defeat to Brighton, Bruno Fernandes found himself at the centre of an unexpected storm off the pitch, after his official X account was hacked and began posting a series of bizarre and taunting messages.Fernandes played the full 90 minutes in the third-round loss on Sunday, a result that compounded United's inconsistent season. Later that night, however, confusion spread among supporters when the Portuguese midfielder's verified X account — followed by more than 4.5 million users — suddenly sprang to life for the first time in months.The posts initially appeared to promote cryptocurrency-related content, asking followers for help “making a coin” and expressing mock confusion over crypto platforms. Within minutes, the tone shifted sharply, with messages openly mocking Manchester United's struggles just hours after their FA Cup exit. One post read: “Man Utd are in the dumps,” while another claimed, “This is why I need to get paid more.”As the situation escalated, the hacker began tagging high-profile accounts, including YouTuber KSI, world darts champion Luke Littler, the England cricket team and even adult star Bonnie Blue.One message bizarrely promoted Macclesfield FC, fresh from their shock FA Cup upset of Crystal Palace.Manchester United were quick to acknowledge the breach. In a statement from the club's official account, United warned supporters: “Bruno Fernandes' X account has been hacked. Fans should not interact with any posts or direct messages.”Despite the warning, the individual behind the hack continued to post and reply, even mocking the situation with comments such as: “Aren't you having fun?” One of the most provocative posts resurfaced an image of Liverpool's infamous 7–0 win over United at Anfield in March 2023, rubbing salt into fresh wounds.The hacked account also replied sarcastically to teenage United prospect Shea Lacey, who had apologised publicly after being sent off against Brighton.Fernandes, who rarely uses X, had last posted in October to mark his 300th appearance for the club. By late night, the posts were deleted as club officials worked to regain control.The incident adds Fernandes to a growing list of elite players targeted online, highlighting the increasing vulnerability of high-profile athletes in the digital age.","Manchester United captain Bruno Fernandes' official X account was hacked.

In a recent post, Lil Wayne returned to X with a calmer message.

Xavier Worthy injury update and recovery timeline

Kansas City expected Xavier Worthy to build on a promising rookie year in 2025, but the season never followed that script. From the opening week, the Chiefs' wide receiver found himself fighting through physical setbacks that lingered well beyond a single game. By mid-January, the focus finally shifted from survival to recovery.On Jan 14, 2026, WR had undergone successful shoulder surgery, closing the door on a season shaped by pain management and limited availability. The update came directly from the player, signaling a personal achievement after months of battling through injuries that clearly affected his performance.The turning point came early. Worthy injured his right shoulder in Week 1 against the Los Angeles Chargers on Sept. 8, 2025. He tore his labrum during the game and dislocated his shoulder, but chose to delay surgery in order to stay on the field. That decision allowed him to return after missing time early in the season, but the injury never fully settled.The shoulder issue followed Worthy throughout the year. He appeared on the Chiefs’ injury report as late as Week 8 with the same problem and later dealt with an ankle injury that surfaced around Week 13.While he appeared in 14 games overall, he missed multiple contests because of injury and sat out the regular-season finale in Week 18 with an illness after Kansas City was already eliminated from playoff contention.After the procedure, Worthy shared his update on X on Jan 14, writing, “Successful surgery. Coming for it all next year; let’s work on the road to recovery.”He posted the message following the operation and later shared an Instagram story showing his arm in a sling, confirming the surgery involved his shoulder.In addition to the shoulder injury, Worthy also battled an ankle issue. Even with the ailments, he missed only two games due to injury this season.The numbers reflect the toll. Worthy finished the 2025 season with 42 receptions for 532 receiving yards and one touchdown. When rushing plays are included, he totaled 53 touches for 619 scrimmage yards. The output marked a step back from his rookie campaign, when he stayed healthy and played a full season.Kansas City felt the impact beyond Worthy’s stat line. The Chiefs finished a third straight season without a 1,000-yard wide receiver, and salary cap constraints limit significant additions this offseason. That reality places added importance on internal growth, particularly from young players already in the system.Earlier, HC Andy Reid said that the star WR was not healthy. But as of now, the team has not released a formal recovery timeline, but Worthy’s surgery feels like no less than a glimmer of hope in the gloom. A whole rehabilitation window now gives him a chance to reset. For the Chiefs, his health may determine whether their expansive receiver room finally turns a corner in 2026.Also Read: Fred Warner Injury Update: Seahawks’ playoff plans shaken as 49ers star trends toward playing in decisive Divisional Round clash","Xavier Worthy underwent successful shoulder surgery on Jan 14, 2026.

Jason Kelce started out as just another Philly dude blocking defenders for the Eagles but over the past decade, he transformed into one of the NFL ’s most financially strong personalities. From rookie salary checks to Pro Bowl payouts and now media deals and his very podcast with his brother Travis Kelce. His money glow-up is one for the history books.Let’s break down exactly how he went from NFL starter to $60 million mogul, year by year.By 2016, Jason Kelce was a solid starter for the Eagles, pulling in steady NFL cash thanks to his 2014 extension ($37.5M over 5 years). At this point, his net worth was coming around $8–10M. Not bad for a guy still dodging defensive linemen and perfecting the “Kelce dance” after touchdowns.By 2018, his performance and endorsements (Nike, Old Spice, and local Philly deals) pushed him to around $15–18M. Money was stacking but it was still “football first” energy.2019 was the year Jason really flexed financially. A one-year contract extension reportedly worth $7M+ landed him in the NFL elite circle. Combine that with Pro Bowl selections and rising endorsement value and his net worth grew to $22–25M.Fast forward to 2021 and his annual earnings from the Eagles approached $14M per year.Endorsements kept increasing and his net worth climbed to $30–35M. Not too shabby for a guy who just wants to block, snap, and celebrate.As Kelce hit the final chapters of his playing career, he was still raking it in. 2022 and 2023 brought salaries around $14–14.25M each year. Add in endorsements and by the end of 2023, his net worth was estimated around $40–45M. He was still breaking ankles on the field and now quietly breaking the bank off it too.Kelce retired after 13 seasons, having racked up $80M+ in career NFL earnings. But this wasn’t the end, his media deals, brand partnerships and podcast opportunities didn’t let the cash flow stop. By 2024, his net worth was already around $50M.Now we’re talking about big moves. Kelce jumped into broadcasting with ESPN’s(multi-million payout) and launched the podcastwith his brother Travis which reportedly got a $100M deal for the duo. Add in endorsements and smart investments, and by the early 2026, Kelce’s net worth sits comfortably at $60M.From Philly trenches to podcast king, Jason Kelce’s glow-up isn’t just on the field, it’s in the bank too. $60M later, and we’re all just here watching him flex responsibly, with the same energy that made him an NFL legend.Also read - Adam Thielen retires after 13 NFL seasons: Inside one of football’s most unlikely success stories","Jason Kelce started out as just another Philly dude blocking defenders for the Eagles but over the past decade, he transformed into one of the NFL ’s most financially strong personalities.

Tom Brady opens up on nonstop schedule after Alix Earle NYE, hints at big moves with Fanatics Studios



Tom Brady's personal life has taken a back seat as the NFL legend leans fully into work and fatherhood during a demanding new chapter. At 48, Brady sounds grounded, reflective, and clear about where his energy goes. Speaking candidly in Los Angeles this week, he made it plain that balance now looks different. His days are full, his focus sharp, and his priorities steady. There is little room for idle time, but plenty of purpose driving his schedule forward.That sense of intention frames everything he does right now. Brady is not chasing headlines or nostalgia. He is building, mentoring, and staying present for the people who matter most. The result is a life that may look busy from the outside, yet feels deeply fulfilling to him. Even when public moments spark speculation, Brady keeps circling back to work ethic, growth, and family as his anchors.At the Fanatics Studios launch party on Jan. 13, Brady explained his mindset with striking honesty. “You know what? I don't have much time for a personal life or much time for myself, but I love working and I love my kids.”The words did not sound defensive. They sounded settled.Brady expanded on why a packed schedule works for him. “I like to be busy and try to really stay fulfilled in the things I'm doing, so I'm working on some really cool projects and I'm involved with some great teams of people that are doing some really positive things.” That fulfillment extends beyond business. It shows up most clearly when he talks about his children.“The father-of-three adds, ""And then obviously, my little babies at home,"" before correcting himself, ""No, they're not babies anymore."" His pride is unmistakable. “My oldest is 18,” Brady says, referring to son Jack. “But seeing him thrive and grow, and there's nothing greater for a parent when you're seeing your kids do well.” He shared that Benjamin, 16, “is doing great as a sophomore,” while Vivian, 13, is his “little baby girl in seventh grade,” and “a little kick-ass volleyball player. ” He summed it up simply. “I'm so blessed in so many parts of my life.”That clarity arrived shortly after Brady was spotted at a New Year’s Eve party in St. Barth’s with influencer Alix Earle. Videos of the two quickly went viral, but Brady did not feed the noise. Instead, he posted a quiet message about kindness and love, writing, “People are not beautiful for how they look or speak. They're beautiful for how they love, care and treat others.”He later reflected on growth itself, noting, “Growth doesn’t really happen unless you’re willing to challenge yourself physically, mentally, and emotionally.” For Brady, that challenge now looks less like game day and more like showing up, every day, for work that matters and kids who are growing fast.Also Read: Tom Brady gets dragged as boring amid Alix Earle dating buzz while Gisele Bündchen reflects on gratitude and family joy","Tom Brady says he has little time for personal life, but loves working and his kids.

Fred Warner Injury Update: Seahawks’ playoff plans shaken as 49ers star trends toward playing in decisive Divisional Round clash,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/fred-warner-injury-update-seahawks-playoff-plans-shaken-as-49ers-star-trends-toward-playing-in-decisive-divisional-round-clash/articleshow/126536554.cms,"Fred Warner Injury Update (getty Images)

Fred Warner’s injury update shifts playoff momentum



Fred Warner walked back onto the practice field this week and instantly changed the emotional temperature around the San Francisco 49ers. In a postseason defined by injuries and doubt, his presence alone carried meaning. The All Pro linebacker has been sidelined since October after suffering a fractured and dislocated right ankle, an injury that typically ends any hope of a same season return. Yet here he was, moving, working.Fred Warner returning to practice did not come with guarantees. His status for Saturday’s Divisional Round clash against the Seattle Seahawks remains uncertain. Still, the timing matters. San Francisco enters the road playoff game battered and undermanned, fresh off losing George Kittle to a season ending Achilles tear. For a roster running low on anchors, Warner’s return to drills felt like oxygen.The injury itself was severe. Warner’s ankle required surgery and the early focus was entirely on next season. That made the decision to open his 21 day practice window surprising across the league. While some inside the organization quietly hoped for a miracle if the 49ers reached the Super Bowl, Warner accelerated the conversation by taking part in linebacker drills this week.According to The San Francisco Standard’s David Lombardi, he even worked the blocking sled and jogged comfortably with no visible brace or wrap.Despite the excitement, Warner remains measured in his approach.“We're taking it day by day,” Warner said, per Nick Wagoner on ESPN. “I think they said last week they weren't going to open my window, and then my window is now open. So yeah, we're just taking it day by day.”He also addressed concerns about pushing too fast.“Everything up to this point has been in direct communication with the doctors, the trainers, everybody involved with my surgery,” Warner said. “Everything is scientifically based… I’m not going to go out there and put myself at an added risk if I’m not ready.”Just days earlier, Kyle Shanahan admitted he was “not very high” on the idea of Warner returning soon. The reversal underscores how rapidly things are progressing. Even if Warner does not suit up, Seattle now has to prepare for the possibility. That uncertainty alone alters protection calls, route concepts, and run fits.Defensive coordinator Robert Saleh summed up what Warner brings, even in limited work.“Just pure energy,” Saleh said. “Fred is the ultimate energy giver… with higher tempo, it’ll be fun to get him out there and see him running around.”The Seahawks dominated the 49ers in the regular season finale. San Francisco knows this rematch will demand more than scheme. Warner’s return does not erase the odds, but it restores something just as important.

Take a look at Bill Belichick’s financial journey over a decade



Bill Belichick Subway Commercial

In 2016, Bill Belichick was already one of the most powerful figures in the NFL. Fresh off another Super Bowl run with the New England Patriots, he wasn’t just a coach; he was an institution, respected for his control, strategy, and one of the league’s highest-paying contracts. His financial growth matched his success on the field: steady, careful, and built over time.A decade later, his role has changed, but his influence hasn’t. By 2026, Belichick has moved from leading the NFL to taking charge in college football at North Carolina. In many ways, 2026 is the new 2016 all over again, showing that his influence, relevance, and earning power are as strong as ever, just on a different stage.Between 2016 and 2024, Bill Belichick built the bulk of his fortune while leading the Patriots. According to Sports Illustrated, his annual pay ranged from $12.5 million to more than $20 million, ranking him among the top earners in the NFL. During that stretch, his net worth climbed steadily, widely estimated to sit in the $40 million to $60 million range between 2016 and 2023, as championship bonuses, extensions, and long-term security compounded year after year. Bloomberg later suggested Belichick may have earned close to $200 million across his 24 seasons in New England alone, a staggering figure for a profession built largely outside the salary cap spotlight.Those years weren’t just about paychecks. They were about leverage. Championships, division titles, and total organizational control allowed Belichick to operate on a different financial tier, one reserved for coaches who double as architects. By the time he exited New England after the 2023 season, estimates already placed his net worth near the upper end of that range, reflecting both sustained earnings and conservative financial management.In 2024, Belichick made a big change by signing a five-year, $50 million deal with the University of North Carolina. This made him one of the highest-paid coaches in college football, contributing to his overall net worth. His base salary is $1 million per year, but extra income from appearances and events brings his total close to $10 million annually. Only the first three years are guaranteed, but finishing the full contract could add another $50 million to his career earnings.By 2025, Belichick had settled into his new role at UNC, and as per Celebrity Net Worth, his net worth between $70 and $75 million. A greater percentage of Belichick’s fortune comes from coaching contracts rather than any business he might have on the side. As of early 2026, his net worth has remained at approximately $70 million due to his college income and his contract terms with UNC.Endorsements have added a bit more income. Belichick tends to stay low-key; however, he has been featured in several commercials by Dunkin’ Subway DoorDash Underdog Fantasy.In general, from 2016 through 2026, there is a sense that his financial graph is a reflection of his coaching approach. He has built his wealth from wise decisions made along the way through contracts entered into with a certain level of consistency that portrays a character who is a doer rather than a dreamer.","Bill Belichick's net worth is estimated to be between $70 and $75 million as of early 2026.

Jaxson Dart’s involvement hints at bigger plan as Giants host John Harbaugh for interview,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/jaxson-darts-involvement-hints-at-bigger-plan-as-giants-host-john-harbaugh-for-interview/articleshow/126536401.cms,"Jaxson Dart (Getty Images)

Jaxson Dart’s appearance fuels speculation as John Harbaugh interviews in person with Giants



The Giants are looking to offer John Harbaugh a coaching chair and it has moved from quiet interest to a full-throttle pursuit, and it started with a bold signal inside the building. The Giants made it clear from the first conversation that this hire is about direction, trust, and long-term vision. They did not treat the meeting as a formality. They treated it as a turning point, bringing decision-makers into one room and showing how serious they are about changing the franchise’s path.That seriousness was underscored by the presence of Jaxson Dart. The rookie quarterback is not just the future of the roster. He is the face of the plan. Including him in the discussion showed Harbaugh how the Giants want their next coach aligned with their most valuable asset from day one.Dart’s involvement was intentional. Coming off a rookie season with 24 total touchdowns, he represents opportunity and leverage. Coaches want clarity when stepping into pressure-filled roles, and the Giants offered exactly that. Dart reportedly joined the meeting at the team facility, reinforcing that New York is building around him rather than starting over.“Harbaugh was at the team facility in East Rutherford, New Jersey, for most of the day Wednesday, the person said. The person spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because the team was not announcing its interviews.” The length of the visit alone suggested depth, not curiosity. It hinted at alignment checks, football philosophy, and long-term planning rather than surface-level introductions.Still, competition remains fierce. Harbaugh’s résumé puts him at the top of a crowded market with nine head coaching vacancies league-wide. Tennessee has already lined up an in-person meeting in Baltimore as it searches for stability after an abrupt coaching reset. Atlanta also remains in the mix after restructuring its football leadership.For the Giants, urgency is shaped by recent history. Brian Daboll was dismissed on Nov. 10 after a 2-8 start, forcing general manager Joe Schoen to reassess culture, leadership, and accountability. Schoen has publicly committed to casting a wide net, completing required interviews while keeping flexibility intact.What separates New York is the message. By placing Dart at the center of the conversation, the Giants framed the job as an opportunity, not a rebuild. For a proven coach like Harbaugh, that clarity could matter as much as money or market size.Also Read: George Kittle’s wife Claire shares emotional injury update as 49ers star begins his long road back","The Giants made it clear from the first conversation that this hire is about direction, trust, and long-term vision.

Drake Maye’s wife Ann (TikTok/@annmichaelmaye)

Drake Maye's wife Ann Michael is suddenly part of the Patriots postseason conversation, though not for anything that happened on the field. As New England rides the momentum of Drake Maye’s first playoff win, fans are just as invested in the moments unfolding off it. The quarterback’s calm leadership has the Patriots favored heading into the Divisional round, but it is a lighthearted kitchen moment from his wife that has captured unexpected attention.Ann Michael Maye has quietly become a fan favorite, not through press boxes or red carpets, but from her own kitchen. Her growing TikTok presence feels genuine and unscripted, the kind of content that draws people in without trying too hard. That authenticity was on full display when a routine cooking video turned tense for a brief second, leaving viewers wincing and laughing all at once.On January 13, Ann shared a new TikTok with her more than 360,000 followers, walking them through dinner preparation for herself and Drake. The plan was simple. Spaghetti squash, sauce, and ground beef. The execution, however, came with a split second that made fans hold their breath.As she attempted to slice the large squash with a heavy knife, Ann paused and voiced the concern many viewers were already feeling. “I feel like I'm really gonna chop my hand off or something here. That would be not good, at all,” she said, before adjusting her grip and safely finishing the cut. The honesty of the moment landed instantly. It was relatable, funny, and real.The rest of the video returned to its familiar rhythm. Ann blended cottage cheese and tomatoes into a sauce, browned ground beef, and assembled the dish with relaxed confidence. In the background, sharp-eyed fans noticed Drake Maye quietly making a cameo, a reminder that even playoff quarterbacks spend their evenings waiting for dinner like everyone else.The final plate may not have looked restaurant ready, but that was never the point. What resonated was the warmth of the moment. Ann Michael Maye did not play to the camera. She simply showed up as herself. In doing so, she reminded fans why they root for this couple as much as they do for the team they represent.Also Read: Drake Maye’s wife Ann Michael sparks curiosity with ‘baby steps’ post that quietly grabs fans’ attention","Ann Michael Maye has quietly become a fan favorite, not through press boxes or red carpets, but from her own kitchen.

George Kittle leans on wife Claire in touching injury update that hints at optimism for 49ers future



George Kittle’s wife Claire (Claire Kittle/Instagram)

George Kittle injury update has taken on a deeply personal tone as his wife, Claire Kittle, opens a window into the raw emotions behind the headlines. The San Francisco 49ers tight end has always been defined by resilience, but this moment cuts deeper because it arrived on the sport’s biggest stage. What unfolded during the Wild Card clash was not just a football setback. It was a life pause that demanded strength beyond the field.For Claire, the memory of watching her husband fall silent before halftime remains frozen in time. One moment carried hope and noise, the next carried stillness. As George Kittle begins the long road back from a torn right Achilles, the spotlight shifts from game plans to grit, from statistics to the human cost of chasing greatness.Claire Kittle did not filter her emotions when she addressed the injury publicly. Her words carried shock, love, and faith, all colliding in a moment no athlete’s family ever prepares for. She described the instant that changed everything, writing, ""Disbelief and stillness were all I felt as I yelled, get up, get up, over and over again. He always gets up. He’s George — he can do all things. He just does it. It hurts. There’s no preparing for it,"" a line that resonated far beyond the 49ers fanbase.Her message was not rooted in pity. It was grounded in belief. Claire doubled down on George’s identity as a fighter, adding, ""I love this man with everything I have in me. He is a unicorn in this world, and he will be back stronger and better than ever before. The mind of a heartbroken athlete is a determined one. He is unf--kwithable, as is this entire team."" The words captured both personal devotion and locker room resolve.Even as George’s ankle swelled and surgery loomed, moments of warmth followed. Photos from the locker room showed laughter through pain, including a tequila toast that reflected the culture of a team refusing to fracture. George echoed that spirit a day later, writing, “Football sucks sometimes. But I love it. I love these guys and this team. Heartbroken but have felt so much love and support from everyone reaching out. I’ll be good. Thank you. We aren’t done yet! Also when your team owner is the first person to meet you in the locker room, you know you’re in a special place. 🥃 cheers, all my love.”Claire later shared him heading into surgery, then a quiet selfie captioned simply, “Love you king.” It was understated, intimate, and powerful.The 49ers now push forward without their emotional engine, facing the Seattle Seahawks in the divisional round on January 17. Inside the locker room, the mission feels clear. Play on. Heal together. And carry George Kittle with them every step of the way.Also Read: George Kittle’s heartbreaking message after Achilles tear turns 49ers’ Eagles win into an emotional locker-room moment","San Francisco 49ers tight end George Kittle is recovering from a torn right Achilles.

Travis Kelce retirement gains momentum after Jamaal Charles weighs in



Travis Kelce retirement has quietly become the most discussed storyline in Kansas City since the season ended, and it is no longer limited to fan speculation. Inside league circles, the conversation feels heavier now, shaped by time, mileage, and the rare reality of having nothing left to chase. For a player who has lived at the center of big moments, the silence around his decision has only amplified the noise.There is a different tone to this offseason. It is not about decline or disappointment. It is about timing. Kelce stands at a crossroads where legacy, health, and opportunity intersect. When former teammates begin to speak openly, it signals that the question is no longer hypothetical. It is personal, practical, and immediate.Jamaal Charles did not hedge his words when asked about Kelce’s future. Speaking while promoting the “GEAR UP Against Cancer” campaign, the Chiefs legend framed retirement as a victory lap rather than a surrender.“I say you need to retire. Yeah, nothing to prove, no more. Man, (You’re) number one tight end, sell his broadcast for a billion dollars,” Charles said. “Man, go enjoy your life — you won a couple of Super Bowls.I mean, that’s more than anybody wishes can win—Pro Bowls, All-Pro tight end. You’re a Hall of Fame tight end.""Charles leaned on perspective, not sentiment. He pointed out that many greats spend their careers chasing what Kelce already owns.“There are a lot of ‘Tony Gonzalezes’ out there, almost the same age, and trying to get a Super Bowl ring, you already got it,” Charles said.The physical toll also entered the conversation, though Charles stopped short of questioning Kelce’s toughness or skill.“If your body doesn’t feel it, I didn’t feel like Travis was playing at a high level like he used to, just by knowing Travis and seeing the way he moved, but he still has it,” Charles said.Kelce himself has been measured. On “New Heights,” he described his annual process of stepping away before deciding anything.“Every season ends for me, I just put my feet up, and I just be a human,” Kelce said. “Just being a regular human for a couple weeks, maybe a month or so, just trying to figure out what I’m going to do next in terms of my future in football.”He acknowledged discussions with the team and made clear the decision rests on recovery, not passion.“There’s a lot of love for the game that’s still there and I don’t think I’ll ever lose that,” Kelce said.What makes this moment different is that football is no longer the only lane. Media conversations have been ongoing for years, separate from any retirement call. If Kelce walks away now, it will not be because the game pushed him out, but because he chose the exit on his own terms.Also Read: “It was a sickness”: Tom Brady opens up on the obsessive habit that defined his legendary NFL career",Travis Kelce's future has become the most discussed storyline in Kansas City.

Tom Brady criticized as dull during Alix Earle dating talk while Gisele Bündchen shares an emotional family recap

Is Tom Brady boring? Of course, people did not expect this to trend alongside New Year glamour, but it landed squarely in pop culture chatter as fresh dating buzz took shape. A single photograph from a St. Barths party was enough to spark speculation, commentary, and blunt opinions, turning a quiet celebrity moment into a loud public debate. Fame, it seems, still invites judgment as much as curiosity.While Tom Brady’s name swirled through headlines for reasons far removed from football, another narrative unfolded in parallel. Gratitude, family, and reflection quietly claimed space online, offering a softer counterpoint to the noise. Together, these moments revealed two very different responses to life under scrutiny, one driven by outside voices, the other shaped by personal peace.Just weeks after Brady was seen chatting with influencer Alix Earle on New Year’s Eve, comedian Chelsea Handler gave an unfiltered take that quickly made waves. Speaking on Page Six Radio on SiriusXM, she did not mince words. “I saw that picture,"" Handler said. ""I have no interest in Tom Brady.I don’t find him dynamic, hot, interesting or fun. I find him so boring.""Handler doubled down, adding, ""I think he’s a total dud. I couldn’t, I mean, so I don’t have any thoughts,"" while also noting she had no real opinion on the rumored pairing since she did not know Earle. The comments struck a nerve, largely because Brady’s romantic history tells a far more glamorous story. Over the years, he has shared his life with actress Bridget Moynahan, supermodel Gisele Bündchen, and has been linked to names like Irina Shayk, Tara Reid, and Kim Kardashian. Boring, at least on paper, rarely enters that equation.As chatter circled Brady, Bündchen appeared firmly rooted in a different season of life. The 45-year-old model shared images from recent weeks with her newborn, her children Vivian Lake and Benjamin Rein, and extended family. “As the new year unfolds, my heart is full of gratitude for the moments spent recharging with my family. May this year bring you love, health, peace, and new adventures,” she wrote. She continued, “May you find the courage to honor your heart’s calling and to know and love yourself more deeply. ”ID@undefinedCaption not available.ID@undefinedCaption not available.Her reflections did not stop there. Looking back on the year, she shared, “As 2025 comes to an end, my heart is full. This year brought deep lessons and profound growth. Becoming a mother again reshaped everything—my time, my priorities, my heart.” In a later interview, Bündchen summed up her current rhythm simply. “Now that my little one is sleeping through the night, I'm back in control of my routine,” she said, adding, “being able to be home with my kids and enjoy every moment with them is priceless. ”While opinions about Brady continue to fly, Bündchen’s message feels steady and intentional. In a landscape fueled by judgment, her focus on gratitude offers a quieter, lasting kind of headline.Also Read: Amid Travis Kelce retirement rumors, Chiefs quietly sign new TE in what feels like a strategic shift","Tom Brady was criticized as dull during Alix Earle dating talk.

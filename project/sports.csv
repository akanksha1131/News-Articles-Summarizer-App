BCCI sends a stern message to Mohsin Naqvi over Asia Cup trophy row

Pakistan A lifted the Asia Cup Rising Stars trophy for a record third time on Sunday, November 23, after edging out Bangladesh A in a nerve-wracking final that stretched into a Super Over at Doha’s West End Park International Cricket Stadium. Irfan Khan Niazi’s side held their nerve in the closing moments, denying Akbar Ali’s Bangladesh their first-ever title in the tournament.ACC chief and PCB chairman Mohsin Naqvi was a prominent presence throughout the evening. Cameras repeatedly showed him reacting animatedly from the stands as the contest swung wildly. Once Pakistan sealed the victory, he stepped onto the field to present the trophy to captain Irfan Khan. His appearance brought back memories of the controversial ending to the 2025 Asia Cup final in Dubai, where Naqvi insisted on personally handing the trophy to India. The Indian team declined, leading to the ceremony being abruptly halted. Naqvi later stated that India captain Suryakumar Yadav should collect the trophy from the ACC office instead.Pakistan’s innings earlier in the day had fluctuated sharply. Reduced to 2 for 2 after early blows to Yasir Khan and Mohammad Faiq, they recovered through steady contributions from Maaz Sadaqat (23 off 18) and Arafat Minhas (25 off 23). But wickets continued to fall, leaving Pakistan at 75 for 6. Saad Masood then produced the innings of the match—an aggressive 38 off 26 balls featuring three fours and three sixes—which pushed Pakistan to a fighting total of 125.Ripon Mondol (3 for 25) and Rakibul Hasan (2 for 16) kept the scoring under tight control.Bangladesh A’s chase began well thanks to Habibur Rahman Sohan’s 26 off 17, but Sufiyan Muqeem’s superb 3 for 11 and two wickets from Arafat Minhas left them reeling at 53 for 7. A late burst from Rakibul Hasan and a dramatic 19-run 19th over from Saqlain and Mondal revived the chase, yet Ahmed Daniyal’s tidy final over pushed the match into a Super Over.Daniyal struck twice in the Super Over despite bowling five wides, restricting Bangladesh to six.

Shubman Gill update: India Test, ODI captain gets a comeback plan from the BCCI

Poll How significant is Kane Williamson's return to the Blackcaps for the upcoming Test series? Extremely significant Somewhat significant Not significant

New Zealand squad:

New Zealand have received a major boost ahead of their home Test summer, with Kane Williamson returning to the Blackcaps squad for the three-match series against the West Indies beginning December 2 in Christchurch. The 14-strong group announced on Monday marks the former captain’s first red-ball appearance since sitting out the winter tour of Zimbabwe.Williamson, the country’s all-time leading Test run-scorer, stepped away from T20 internationals earlier this year and has spent the past few months managing his workload. Head coach Rob Walter said the 35-year-old’s return adds both quality and calm to an already settled Test unit.“Kane’s ability on the field speaks for itself and it will be great to have his skills as well as his leadership back in the Test group,” Walter said. “He’s had a bit of time off to get himself ready for red-ball cricket, and I know he’s looking forward to playing for Northern Districts in the Plunket Shield in the lead-up to the first Test.”While Williamson headlines the squad, New Zealand have also injected fresh pace options.Jacob Duffy, Zak Foulkes and Blair Tickner have been named for the series opener at Hagley Oval. Both Duffy and Foulkes debuted together in Zimbabwe in August, with Foulkes producing a dream start — match figures of 9 for 75, the best by a Blackcap on Test debut.Walter said the selections reward form and readiness. “Zak couldn’t have performed much better in his first Test against Zimbabwe. That, along with his recent white-ball form, has rightfully earned him selection.”Tickner returns to the Test setup for the first time since 2023 after back-to-back player-of-the-match displays against England in the recent ODI series. Walter also backed Duffy and Tickner as reliable options if required. “Both Jacob and Blair have been around a while and know what it takes to perform at the highest level.”All-rounder Daryl Mitchell has been cleared following a minor groin strain, while Kyle Jamieson and Glenn Phillips were unavailable as they continue to manage red-ball returns. Injuries ruled out Matt Fisher, Will O’Rourke and Ben Sears.The first Test begins in Christchurch on December 2, followed by Wellington Test on December 10 and the final match at Bay Oval in Tauranga on December 18.Tom Latham (capt), Tom Blundell, Michael Bracewell, Devon Conway, Jacob Duffy, Zak Foulkes, Matt Henry, Daryl Mitchell, Rachin Ravindra, Mitchell Santner, Nathan Smith, Blair Tickner, Kane Williamson, Will Young","Kane Williamson named in New Zealand squad for Test series against West Indies.

Italy celebrated a remarkable slice of tennis history on Sunday, clinching their third Davis Cup title in as many years with a 2-0 victory over Spain in Bologna. The triumph marked a stunning home treble achieved without star player Jannik Sinner, as Filippo Volandri’s side once again showcased depth, resilience and unity on the biggest stage.The decisive moment came from Flavio Cobolli, who produced a stirring comeback to defeat Jaume Munar 1-6, 7-6 (7/5), 7-5 and secure the title without the doubles rubber being required. The 23-year-old collapsed in joy as the arena erupted, completing Italy’s perfect run through the competition.“This was my dream, we're a really united team, and we tried to recreate the spirit of the Italy team that won the World Cup in 2006,” said Cobolli. “I'm really proud of everyone and our brilliant fans are also part of this team… it's the best day of my life.”Earlier, Matteo Berrettini had put Italy ahead with a composed 6-3, 6-4 win over Pablo Carreno Busta, setting the tone for an afternoon that never looked like slipping away. It capped a flawless campaign in which Italy did not lose a single match, and doubles specialists Simone Bolelli and Andrea Vavassori were not required at any stage.The achievement is even more notable given the absence of Italy’s two highest-ranked players, Sinner and Lorenzo Musetti, both top-10 stars who opted out of the title defence on home soil. Berrettini downplayed the impact of missing names, saying: “It doesn't matter who goes out there for us, we have a deep squad and we have a lot of great lads who play great tennis.”Spain, chasing a seventh Davis Cup crown, were also without world number one Carlos Alcaraz, sidelined by a hamstring injury suffered during the ATP Finals. Captain David Ferrer admitted the margin was slim, saying: “It was a very, very, very close tie… Italy in important moments, they play really good.”Earlier on Sunday, ITF president David Haggerty rejected suggestions that top names were avoiding the competition, insisting: “There's this false feeling out there that top players don't represent their nation. That's not true.”","Italy beat Spain 2-0 to win their third Davis Cup title in as many years. Flavio Cobolli produced a stirring comeback to defeat Jaume Munar 1-6, 7-6 (7/5), 7-5.

Relying on instinct, rhythm and rattle of a ball they couldn’t see, an Indian contingent led by Deepika TC clinched the inaugural Women’s T20 World Cup for the Blind with a seven-wicket win over Nepal. The victory comes weeks after Harmanpreet Kaur’s team hoisted the women’s ODI World Cup. Chasing Nepal’s 114/5, India cruised to 117/3 in just 12.1 overs at the P Saravanamuttu Stadium, the oldest test cricket venue in Sri Lanka.Phula Saren, who comes from a Santhal village in Odisha, anchored the innings with a match-defining 44 off 27 balls.“The girls cried happy tears and so did I,” said Mahantesh Kivadasannavar, the chairman of the Cricket Association for the Blind in India (CABI), the cricket wing of Samarthanam Trust for the Disabled, which organised the Rs 6-crore event with Sri Lanka as co-host.A former blind cricketer himself, Mahantesh took in the action from the stands in Colombo on Sunday. “The Prime Minister of Sri Lanka herself handed over the trophy,” he said.“This win means a lot for the players and sends a powerful message for women’s cricket in India.” An event sponsor has pledged Rs 1 lakh to each player in recognition of their achievement.“Many of the players come from humble, rural backgrounds,” explained Bengaluru-based Mahantesh, adding that they discovered cricket through blind schools, NGO-led camps, and state programmes. “In these pockets, parents don’t send their girls out of the house,” he said.",India beat Nepal by seven wickets to win the inaugural Women's T20 World Cup for the Blind.

'The wicket was very good to bat on': Kuldeep Yadav on Guwahati pitch, turn, South Africa batting and more

Guwahati: The cruel reality of another home Test series loss is setting in. As the late afternoon chill descended on the Assam Cricket Association Stadium in Barsapara on Sunday, the Indian openers must have felt the shiver. A wicket at that stage would have worsened an already difficult day for India, but KL Rahul and Yashasvi Jaiswal navigated the six-over spell under fading light.However, the damage may already have been done. South Africa’s first-innings total of 489 on a red-soil pitch that has barely deteriorated over the last two days has significantly reduced India’s chances of forcing an equaliser in the two-Test series. No wonder Kuldeep Yadav called it a “road” at the end of a gruelling day.Only twice has India won a Test when the opposition has scored more than 450 in the first innings. The last instance came at the MA Chidambaram Stadium in Chennai in 2016 when Karun Nair smashed a triple century, but that was against a demoralised England side which had already lost the series. A miracle would be required for India to turn this one around.Fans had started trooping in on Sunday morning with the hope of seeing their stars bat soon, but Senuran Muthusamy , a 31-year-old allrounder of Indian origin with ancestral roots in Nagapattinam, Tamil Nadu, was determined to make life difficult for the Indian bowlers.Dogged in defence and cautious in approach, Muthusamy nullified the threat posed by Jasprit Bumrah, Kuldeep Yadav, and the rest. The heavy morning roller used by South Africa had reduced any early bite, allowing Muthusamy and keeper-batter Kyle Verreynne (45) to focus on survival.Only 69 runs were scored in the first 29 overs, and while Verreynne’s dismissal stumped off Ravindra Jadeja briefly offered a flicker of hope, it was quickly extinguished. Muthusamy (109) accumulated runs with careful nudges and pushes, while Marco Jansen, walking in at No. 9, unleashed his hitting power. Using his long levers, he launched into Jadeja, hitting multiple huge sixes as Jadeja struggled for traction and Washington Sundar focused on containment.Kuldeep Yadav (4-115) remained India’s only hope, but Jansen (93 off 91 balls) read him perfectly, sending him over-boundary after over-boundary. Jansen ended with seven sixes — the highest by an overseas batter in India — surpassing Matthew Hayden and Viv Richards.Meanwhile, Muthusamy nudged his way to his first Test century as the eighth-wicket stand with Jansen put on 97 runs. “I came here in 2019 and when we got thrashed, I never believed I would get a chance to return to India. My mother and aunt have roots here, and it feels really good to get my first Test century,” said Muthusamy, who had scored a crucial 89 against Pakistan last month in Rawalpindi. He also praised Jansen: “You’ve seen in the IPL how good a player he is. It was a pleasure watching him from the other end.”With lights fading, Jansen looked set for a century until he edged one onto the stumps off Kuldeep, pushing India into an uncomfortable half-hour. Rahul and Jaiswal managed to survive despite a few nervy moments, but Monday could bring a different challenge if the pitch begins to deteriorate.",South Africa's first-innings total of 489 on a red-soil pitch has significantly reduced India’s chances of forcing an equaliser in the two-Test series.

Guwahati:

India ODI squad: Bizarre selection calls, no explanation and no logic

If the Eden Gardens pitch was a snake-pit, this 22-yard strip is a “road”. That’s what Kuldeep Yadav , India’s most successful bowler, during the course of the two-day toil against South Africa in Barsapara, felt at the end of second day’s play here.A tired-looking left-arm wrist spinner smiled when asked to compare the two surfaces. “Kolkata was different, yeh to pura road tha (this is absolutely a road),” Kuldeep’s words aptly summed up the disappointment that the team felt after being unable to get anything out of the pitch.But was it entirely the pitch’s fault? If we go back in time, to the first decade of 2000s, India used to play on such pitches. And that didn’t stop them from winning Test series after another — as hosts, India didn’t lose a series till 2012.There was a shift in 2012 after India lost to England and the then-captain MS Dhoni became adamant for dry, black-soil pitches where left-arm finger spinners bowling faster through the air would wreak havoc from day one.It paid maximum dividends, making India an impregnable fortress for a while — with whitewashes of Australia, England and South Africa.But things have changed over the last 12 months and India are staring at their second home series defeat.With the losses coming mostly on square turners, there has been a sudden clamour for “good pitches”.It reached a crescendo after the Eden fiasco and the BCCI provided a traditional red-soil pitch at a venue hosting its first-ever Test match. The pitch had enough bounce and carry on the first two days and the experts are insisting that natural wear and tear will happen, which will make second-innings batting difficult. But on a track like this, to get wickets in the first innings, variations in speed, use of drift, and most importantly, the ability to turn the ball become very important. Ravindra Jadeja , the 342-wicket man who spreads terror when the pitch starts turning from Day 1, hardly looked threatening. He kept bowling quick through the air and failed to extract turn, an aspect so crucial to break open an innings. And when he tried to bowl it slightly slower, Marco Jansen smashed him out of the park. He can still be a handful in the second innings if his batters do their job, but 2-94 isn’t exactly match-winning returns from the leader of the pack.Washington Sundar (0-58) rarely bothered any batter as the last four wickets of South Africa plundered 243 runs. Kuldeep was the only one who tried to use his variations and drift, being rewarded too on the first day. But on Sunday, the South Africans seemed to be playing him better. He felt that they bowled well as a unit despite the runs conceded.“I tried to use the angles and the drift as much as I could, but you’ll have to give credit to the South Africans for the way they batted,” Kuldeep said.There was also a theory whether he was under-bowled a bit, especially when India had to be on the field for so long. He bowled 29.1 — only 12 on the second day. All-rounder Nitish Reddy bowled only six and there were questions asked about skipper Rishabh Pant ’s handling of resources.“It’s not my call to take, but when there are six bowlers, someone will be slightly under-bowled,” Kuldeep kept it at that.","Kuldeep Yadav was India’s most successful bowler during the course of the two- day toil against South Africa in Barsapara. “I tried to use the angles and the drift as much as I could, but you’ll have to give credit to the South Africans for the way they batted,” Kuldeep said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125528655,imgsize-195656,width-400,resizemode-4/guwahati-nov-22-ani-india39s-kuldeep-yadav-and-ravindra-jadeja-celebrate-the-.jpg"

South African all-rounder Senuran Muthusamy , who had a disappointing debut in India in 2019, made a remarkable comeback by scoring a crucial 109 runs against India in 2025. His performance came after successful outings in Pakistan where he took 11 wickets in the first Test and scored 89 not out in the second Test, demonstrating his improved ability to play in subcontinental conditions.Muthusamy entered to bat when South Africa was at 201 for five, turning the situation around with his century. This marks a significant turnaround from his 2019 debut series in India where he managed only two wickets in two Tests.""My journey's been unique. Got a taste of international cricket in 2019 in India, debuted here, went back into the wilderness a little bit. Like you say, cricket is such a journey that you just try to take it one day at a time. You try not to think too far ahead. But there were times, especially after 2019, where I wasn't sure if I'd ever play Test cricket again and certainly not in India after we lost that series,"" Muthusamy reflected.""So just really grateful for the support that I've got back home, for the people that are really close with me, the coaches, the support staff here, the players, my family back home, my friends. They've been incredible.""After his debut series, Muthusamy had to wait four years to play his third Test, spending time in domestic cricket. He has also worked with sports scientist Cheryl Calder to enhance his performance.""Yeah, it's fantastic, especially having come through to India in 2019 and we lost the series pretty badly.

So, I thought he batted really, really well. That was an awesome partnership to really set up the innings. And Marco was sublime when he came in. You guys know him really well from his T20 exploits, especially in India. He's got fantastic levers. He's a clean striker of the ball and he really, really showed his skills today. So, that was an awesome treat to watch from the other end.""","Senuran Muthusamy scored 109 runs in South Africa's first innings against India.

Delays and deadlines

Villarreal keep pace

A stunner from midfield

Barcelona marked its long-awaited return to Camp Nou with a commanding 4-0 win over a 10-man Athletic Bilbao, turning the night into a double celebration.Around 45,000 supporters filled the partially reopened stadium, which is operating at roughly half capacity after more than two years of renovation work. The club, burdened by heavy debt, is banking on the revamped venue to generate much-needed revenue.The evening began perfectly for the hosts as Robert Lewandowski struck just four minutes in. Ferran Torres then netted twice, both goals created by excellent service from young star Lamine Yamal, before Fermín López added another on his Camp Nou debut. Athletic’s hopes faded completely when Oihan Sancet was sent off in the 53rd minute for a reckless challenge on López, with Barcelona already three goals clear.Lewandowski said the night meant more than the scoreline. “We played well from the start and added another three points, but the real joy today is being back at Camp Nou. Playing here is different. We feel stronger.”Fans embraced that feeling too. Despite the cold, there was a festive energy as thousands sang the club anthem before kick-off. Their last visit to Camp Nou had been in May 2023, and for over 900 days they had to travel to the less accessible Olympic Stadium on the city’s hillside for home matches.“It’s like returning home,” said 36-year-old supporter Carlos Narváez. “The atmosphere at the Olympic Stadium wasn’t the same. You can see how excited everyone is.”To mark the occasion, Barcelona released clouds of blue and maroon smoke before the game and staged a fireworks show afterward. Some supporters even chanted Lionel Messi ’s name, remembering the golden era he owned on this very pitch.But the new Camp Nou is still far from its final form. Large cranes tower above the incomplete upper tier, which remains an exposed frame of concrete and steel. Many parts of the ground still resemble an active construction zone. Once finished, the stadium is projected to hold 105,000 spectators.There were also positive notes on the injury front. Joan García returned in goal, while Raphinha made a late appearance, both stepping back onto the pitch after nearly two months out with leg injuries.The victory lifted Barcelona level on points with leaders Real Madrid, who travel to Elche on Sunday. Up next for Xavi’s side is a Champions League visit to Chelsea on Tuesday.Renovation work began in June 2023 with the aim of modernising and expanding the famed arena, previously seating 99,000. The club raised 1.45 billion euros (about $1.6 billion at the time) through several investors to fund the ambitious overhaul.Barcelona had hoped to return by November 2024 to coincide with its 125th anniversary, but the target was pushed back multiple times. The club has yet to announce a new completion date and plans to request permission to open additional sections as progress continues.More than 20,000 fans recently attended Barcelona’s first open training session back at the stadium, and this week UEFA cleared the club to host Eintracht Frankfurt at Camp Nou on 9 December.Villarreal remained just two points behind the leaders after Tani Oluwaseyi struck an 83rd-minute winner in a 2-1 victory against Mallorca. The Canadian forward, formerly of Major League Soccer, secured all three points late on.Real Sociedad produced a dramatic second-half turnaround in their 3-1 win over Osasuna, capped by a spectacular goal from Ander Barrenetxea. Spotting goalkeeper Sergio Herrera off his line, the forward launched a lob from inside the centre circle. Herrera managed to get a hand to it, but not enough to prevent the ball from dropping into the net. It was Sociedad’s first away victory of the campaign.Elsewhere, Iago Aspas converted a second-half penalty to give Celta Vigo a narrow 1-0 win away to Alaves.","Barcelona beat Athletic Bilbao 4-0 at Camp Nou.

Jonty Rhodes on India's challenge vs spin, domestic cricket and fixed Test centres

“It’s about time. It’s been so long!”That was manager Mikel Arteta’s response when quizzed about Arsenal’s long-wait for a fourth Premier League title. And this was three years ago! The wait has only grown longer for a club who were last crowned English champions in 2004.With the Spaniard now into his sixth full season since taking charge of the Gunners, the “it’s about time” sentiment has only increased among, not just critics, but club icons too. Back in May, Thierry Henry, the club’s record goalscorer conceded that Arsenal should have had some silverware to show for their efforts, considering how close they have come on a couple of occasions within the last three years.Also Watch:Three months into the new season, they have got off to a start which once again has their long suffering fans brimming with hope. Ahead of Sunday’s eagerly-anticipated North London derby against Tottenham Hotspur, Arsenal sit four points clear at the top of the table with 11 games played. It’s the sort of situation that’s bound to generate ‘a lot of noise’, as the club’s star midfielder Declan Rice pointed out.“I think it's just one of those things that there's always going to be talk around us because we have such a good manager, we have such good players, and obviously with the start we've had this season,” Rice told The Times of India in an interview facilitated by JioHotstar this week.“We've been top of the table going into the last two international breaks, so that creates a lot of noise. But it's important for us that we block that out, which we have been doing.“We take no notice of it and we just keep doing what we've been doing, because in the Premier League, anything can happen at any time, and we just need to stay focused and take one game at a time. We're doing well at just focusing on ourselves at the minute, which is good.”A big reason behind Arsenal’s march is Rice. In the build-up to Sunday’s big clash at the Emirates, the league shared a one-minute clip on one of its official social media accounts, highlighting the England international’s all-round impact. From scoring goals to creating chances, Rice “can do it all”, the caption stated.The 26-year-old believes he can do even more, as he spoke of how his mental approach to the game has transformed since becoming a club-record signing for Arsenal two seasons ago. “In my earlier days, I wasn't really bothered about scoring or assisting. I just wanted to just play well for the team and get three points. But on top of that, now I've got that hunger and obsession with helping the team out, knowing that my goal and my assist has helped us to win. So if I can score or assist, that makes me really happy.“But I've still got so much room for improvement in that area as well. I think I can score way more and can assist more as well. So we're going to keep pushing for that.”Rice, of course, is not just integral to Arsenal’s objectives but to the national team’s as well, in a season leading into the Fifa World Cup . And the Three Lions shirt carries its own weight of expectations from a football-mad nation desperate to end a major trophy drought that makes Arsenal’s wait seem much lighter in comparison. Rice spoke of the challenge of juggling responsibilities with club and country.“Obviously, when we have our club games, we're fully 100% committed and focused on that. But then when we go away with England, you need to put 100% energy into that as well. Because if you turn up to England and don't have 100% energy or you don't apply yourself in the right way, then you're not going to have the results that we've just had,” he said, referring to England’s historic World Cup qualifying campaign which saw Thomas Tuchel’s side finish with a perfect record of eight wins from as many matches and no goals conceded.“So when you go away, you have to park the club part to the side for a week or 10 days, for however long you’re away. And as soon as you're back with Arsenal, then you get back into the swing of things.“Even Tuchel, the manager, speaks about it in terms of us just being together and everyone pulling in the right direction. It’s like, ‘don’t bring your club stuff into England’ and it just keeps it really fresh.”In last season’s Champions League quarterfinal first leg against record 15-time winners Real Madrid, Rice served notice of his ability in dead-ball situations, scoring two magical free kicks in a 3-0 win for Arsenal. The second of those two stunners has earned him a nomination for the FIFA Puskas Award (best goal of the year), the mention of which brings a wide smile to his face. Asked if there was a dead-ball specialist who helped shape his own style and Rice would name a famous compatriot.“Free kicks, I think the most iconic ones, obviously (David) Beckham, just because of how many he scored, the way he took them. We obviously have a completely different run up, but it's just iconic the way he took free kicks and how many he scored. I've only scored two. They've been two good ones, but I need to score some more now.”Beware Tottenham!(Watch Arsenal vs Tottenham Hotspur in the Premier League on Nov 23, Live & exclusive on Star Sports Network and JioHotstar)",Arsenal sit four points clear at the top of the Premier League with 11 games played.

Liverpool’s Premier League campaign continued its downward spiral on Saturday as the defending champions suffered a 3-0 home defeat to Nottingham Forest. Meanwhile, Manchester City’s pursuit of Arsenal was stalled by a 2-1 loss at Newcastle.Liverpool’s sixth defeat of the season leaves them 11th in the table, eight points behind leaders Arsenal, with a game in hand. Coach Arne Slot described the result as “very, very, very bad” and admitted he could offer no excuses for the team’s worrying form.“That is far from good enough, and I’m responsible for that,” Slot said after Murillo, Nicolo Savona, and Morgan Gibbs-White’s goals at Anfield handed Liverpool six losses in their last seven league games. To put it in perspective, last season’s title-winning team lost only four matches all campaign.Arsenal benefited from the slip-ups of its main rivals without taking the field. City suffered their fourth defeat as Harvey Barnes scored twice for Newcastle at St James’ Park. Chelsea moved up to second, closing to within three points of Arsenal with a 2-0 win over Burnley. Arsenal faces Tottenham on Sunday.Elsewhere, Crystal Palace beat Wolves 2-0, Fulham edged Sunderland 1-0, Brighton recovered from a goal down to beat Brentford 2-1, and Bournemouth came back from 2-0 down to draw 2-2 with West Ham.Forest’s victory marked the second consecutive season they’ve beaten Liverpool at Anfield and lifted Sean Dyche’s side out of the relegation zone. It was also Forest’s first back-to-back wins this season under their third coach, following the dismissals of Nuno Espirito Santo and Ange Postecoglou.Liverpool has managed just one league win since September 20. The latest defeat could have been heavier, as Igor Jesus saw a first-half goal disallowed for handball. Murillo opened the scoring in the 33rd minute, with Savona doubling Forest’s advantage immediately after the break. Gibbs-White wrapped up the 3-0 win in the 78th minute.Even the return of Alisson and Alexander Isak, who started his first league match in a month, failed to lift Liverpool’s fortunes. Isak was substituted after 68 minutes, extending his goalless streak to six games this season. Captain Virgil van Dijk said: “Everyone is disappointed, like they should be, because losing at home against Nottingham Forest is very bad.”Manchester City had the chance to draw level with Arsenal but were undone by Newcastle. Harvey Barnes scored in the 63rd minute, Ruben Dias equalised for City shortly after, only for Barnes to flick in the winner seven minutes later. City now sit third, four points behind Arsenal. Pep Guardiola insisted, “There is a long, long, long way to go.”Chelsea moved up to second thanks to goals from Pedro Neto and Enzo Fernandez at Burnley. Neto opened the scoring in the 37th minute, with Fernandez sealing the 2-0 win in the 88th. Burnley slipped into the relegation zone, while West Ham squandered a 2-0 lead at Bournemouth, letting Marcus Tavernier and Enes Unal secure a 2-2 draw.Crystal Palace defeated Wolves 2-0, with goals from Daniel Munoz and Yeremy Pino in quick succession, leaving Wolves still without a win in 12 matches. Brighton maintained their momentum with Danny Welbeck scoring his seventh goal in eight games to help the Seagulls overturn Brentford 2-1.

CHENNAI: Republic of Ireland’s toothless performances in the first half of their FIFA World Cup qualifying campaign caused ire among the national team’s faithfuls.After Ireland picked up only a solitary point from their first three group F matches, some even went to the extent of mocking head coach Heimir Hallgrimsson, questioning how a ‘tooth fixer’ could solve their aggravating problems. But Hallgrimsson, also a qualified dentist hailing from Iceland, stuck to his methods to eventually make his once doubters grin from ear to ear.Thanks to a tooth-and-nail fight in the all-important 3-2 victory over Hungary, led by hat-trick hero Troy Parrott who successfully completed the operation, the ‘Boys in Green’ are now just two steps away from the global extravaganza.“Of course, I am biased but, in my opinion, we have been steadily improving,” Hallgrimsson told TOI after steering Ireland to the WC playoffs, a run that also included a famous win against Portugal. “We have had performances, but we cannot always turn performances into wins. It takes time for the players to do it, not only to believe in what we are doing but also to believe in each other. I felt that this (three-match winning streak) was coming and I could smell it. ”In a chat arranged by Sports For Life, a platform for grassroots sports development, Hallgrimsson said that he learned from those around him that consistency is the most important part of a national team.“We just have to stick to what we believe will get us the results. There has been consistency in the way we speak to the players and the way they train and play. We never stopped believing. When you never stop believing, you always have a chance to score a lucky goal, if you can term it that,” said the former Iceland coach.While the Irish football community is basking in the moment and buzzing with excitement, Hallgrimsson is focused on accomplishing the mission. In the playoffs in March, Ireland will cross swords with Czech Republic, and if they get past that hurdle, will face either Denmark or North Macedonia in what Hallgrimsson described as a ‘cup final’.“The nation is with us, but I hope that they do not go overboard. We must grow to keep on winning because the task ahead is always bigger. I believe that we have a psychological edge (of having been in the same situation in the past).”Learnings from dentistry: Hallgrimsson’s learnings from dentistry have come in handy during his football managerial career, with the coach saying that it has helped him better understand the psychological characteristics of his players.“When you are a dentist, you always need to approach the person on the dental chair. A lot of people are afraid to sit on it, so I need to adjust to the people who are coming. You need to calm down some of them; you need to cheer up some of them. It is the same with football players. They have different characteristics, so I need to adapt. I need to speak in one way to one player and in a different way to some other player. It is something that has helped me, probably more than education in medicine, sickness etc,” he said.","Heimir Hallgrimsson says consistency is the most important part of a national team. The Iceland-born coach believes that his players have never stopped believing. Ireland will face Czech Republic in the World Cup playoffs in March. If they get past that hurdle, they will face either Denmark or North Macedonia.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125510643,imgsize-1108750,width-400,resizemode-4/resizecom_ic.jpg"

Quinshon Judkins turned an 11 yard run into the most concerning moment for the Cleveland Browns

The Cleveland Browns have been on a quest for hope this season, and they discovered it in Quinshon Judkins, a rookie running back who injected power, calmness, and reliability into a team in desperate need of stability. Week after week, he bulldozed through defenders, led the offense, and performed like a seasoned pro. So when he fell on Sunday after his head hit the ground, the immediate reaction from fans was one of deep concern.He attempted to lift himself up, but it was clear he was struggling. Trainers rushed in to assist him in standing and took him directly to the blue medical tent. Initial indications suggested a concussion evaluation. Soon enough, online media confirmed the fans' worries. Justin David Kish reported that Judkins was taken to the tent for a more thorough check-up. Tom Christ shared a video that showed the precise moment his head struck the ground, emphasizing the reason for the cautious approach of the medical team.The big moment happened in the third quarter when the Browns were looking to build on their lead. During a standard run up the middle, Judkins received a handoff and pushed ahead for an 11-yard gain.Demonstrating the determination that has characterized his rookie season, he powered through the first hit, breaking tackles and battling for additional yards.As the Raiders' defenders closed in, Judkins took a tough hit. His head jerked back and forth sharply before hitting the ground hard. He lay there for a while, causing worry among his teammates, officials, and medical personnel. This kind of hit definitely raises alarms in the NFL today, where keeping players safe is crucial.What caused the injury? It was a direct result of Judkins' physical playing style. His low center of gravity and aggressive running straight ahead make him tough to tackle, but they also put him at risk for hard hits. In this instance, the force from getting past blockers made him susceptible when the pile fell apart, resulting in an awkward head-first fall. These kinds of situations happen frequently for running backs who navigate the tight spaces, but Judkins' youth and lack of experience heightened the concern.Once on the field, Judkins was slow to get up and trainers had to help him to the sideline. He went straight into the blue medical tent for an evaluation, with early reports indicating a potential concussion protocol check due to the head impact.When the fourth quarter began, Judkins made a move to return, jogging back onto the field to the applause of Browns fans watching from a distance. However, the officials swiftly intervened, leading him off and back to the tent for a check-up which is a routine measure to avoid any early re-entry in line with concussion protocols.Social media was alive with updates from reporters on the scene. Sports journalist Justin David Kish tweeted: ""NFL Injury Report (Browns): Cleveland Browns rookie RB Quinshon Judkins has gone to the sideline during the Browns' drive and is now heading to the blue medical tent for further evaluation. Stay tuned for more updates. #NFL"" Injury analyst Tom Christ added a video clip, noting: ""Quinshon Judkins #browns Head slams into the ground as he gets tackled. Stayed down for a while, presumably will be getting a concussion screen.""Relief came soon after. Judkins cleared the necessary checks and re-entered the game, finishing strong. He ended the day with 15 carries for 38 yards and his two earlier touchdowns—solid production despite the abbreviated third quarter. His return not only eased concerns but also helped seal the win, as Cleveland's ground game chewed up the clock in the final frame.Also Read: Bryce Dunlap cause of death.

Aaron Rodgers’ injury update and Steelers playoff hopes



Aaron Rodgers’ fractured left wrist kept him off the field in Sunday’s tight 31-28 loss to the Bears, but Mike Tomlin’s message afterward was clear and confident. He sees Rodgers returning against the Buffalo Bills in seven days, a belief that steadied both the locker room and the fan base after another deflating defeat. The Steelers need momentum, and Tomlin seems convinced that their veteran quarterback will deliver it. “I anticipate him being ready for next week,” Tomlin said after the game, planting a firm line of hope.Rodgers injured his wrist during last week’s win over the Bengals and spent much of the week focused on rehab. He missed Wednesday’s session, eased into limited work on Thursday and Friday with a stabilizing brace, and was listed as questionable right up until Sunday morning. It was a week of uncertainty, not only for Rodgers himself but for how the offense would adjust.When the Steelers finally turned to Mason Rudolph as the starter, it wasn’t a sudden call. The backup learned of the decision on Saturday. Tomlin explained, “It was a prudent decision to make. Certainly, it wasn’t a fluid week for (Rodgers). It was a fluid week for Mason (Rudolph) in terms of reps and so forth. I think it’ll be in our rear view as we move forward.”Rudolph responded by completing 24 of 31 passes for 171 yards, a touchdown, one interception and losing a fumble. Chicago punished those miscues, converting them into fourteen points that proved costly.Earlier in the week, Tomlin insisted Rodgers did not need heavy practice reps, given his experience. By Sunday, that tune shifted as the coach emphasized that increased workload would be key in the coming days. When asked what will change by next week for a wrist injury that still requires time to heal, he answered, “Just on the surface level, the amount that he will be able to work next week.”The Steelers now sit at 6 and 5, slipping in a crowded AFC North where the Ravens hold the advantage due to tiebreakers. To keep playoff hopes alive, Pittsburgh needs Rodgers not just active but productive. Tomlin is betting on exactly that. And for now, the city watches Wednesday’s practice report with renewed anticipation.Also Read: Will Aaron Rodgers play against Chicago Bears today?

Jordon Hudson launches lawsuit against Pablo Torre while turning media battle into a public power move,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/jordon-hudson-launches-lawsuit-against-pablo-torre-while-turning-media-battle-into-a-public-power-move/articleshow/125528659.cms,"Jordon Hudson is taking legal action against sports commentator Pablo Torre, filing a lawsuit with a defiant social media post featuring Taylor Swift lyrics. This move escalates a months-long dispute over Torre's reporting on Hudson and her relationship with Bill Belichick, shifting the narrative from media subject to active agent.

Jordon Hudson uses Taylor Swift lyrics while reviving months-long conflict with Pablo Torre

Jordon Hudson isn’t just brushing off criticism, she’s going on offense. The 23-year-old girlfriend of longtime coaching legend Bill Belichick has stepped into a spotlight she never actively chased, and instead of bowing out, she’s leveraging it. On Sunday, Hudson filed a lawsuit against sports commentator Pablo Torre, doing so with swagger, social savvy, and a carefully chosen Taylor Swift lyrical burn.Her message wasn’t the reaction of someone embarrassed or intimidated, it came from a woman crafting her own narrative, equal parts defiant and performative. And in doing so, she turned a media dispute into a larger cultural moment about ownership of image, reputation, and control.Hudson didn’t announce the lawsuit with legal jargon, she used symbolism. In her Instagram post, she displayed an “all access” badge emblazoned with her name and a necklace reading “banned,” tagging Pablo Torre along with it.She layered the post with the Taylor Swift track “Actually Romantic” from “The Life of a Showgirl,” highlighting the third-verse barb, ""And I know you think it comes off vicious. But it's precious, adorable like a toy chihuahua barking at me from a tiny purse. That's how much it hurts. How many times has your boyfriend said, 'Why are we always talking 'bout her?'""The tension between Hudson and Torre began in May after Torre claimed UNC had barred Hudson from team facilities, an allegation the school denied.Things resurfaced when Apple Podcasts later recognized Torre’s show, and Hudson quipped on X: “You’re welcome,” a sharp reminder that episodes involving her and Belichick, generated some of Torre’s highest engagement.Torre’s coverage also included commentary on leaked Airbnb camera footage showing Belichick, prompting Hudson to publicly call Torre’s reporting “factually incorrect, slanderous, defamatory and targeted.”Hudson’s lawsuit marks a turning point. Instead of simply arguing online, she’s choosing legal recourse. Whether one views her as strategically assertive or theatrically reactive, one reality stands out: Hudson has now shifted from being a subject of the conversation to being an active agent shaping it.Also Read: Brittany Mahomes turns Arrowhead into a runway with radiant red game-day style and heartfelt support for Patrick Mahomes","Jordon Hudson filed a lawsuit against sports commentator Pablo Torre on Sunday.

What record did Dak Prescott break? Inside the moment the Cowboys QB became the franchise’s all-time passing leader,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/what-record-did-dak-prescott-break-inside-the-moment-the-cowboys-qb-became-the-franchises-all-time-passing-leader/articleshow/125528174.cms,"Dak Prescott has officially become the most prolific passer in Dallas Cowboys history, surpassing Tony Romo's long-standing yardage record. This milestone highlights Prescott's tenure, durability, and the organization's belief in him, adding to his existing franchise records for completions, completion percentage, and passer rating. The achievement solidifies his place in the team's historical narrative.

Dak Prescott’s milestone underscores his growth, efficiency, and enduring leadership

Dak Prescott’s legacy with the Dallas Cowboys may have already been cemented by his leadership and steady production, but this season it became official: he is now the most prolific passer in Cowboys history. His third-quarter, nine-yard completion to George Pickens wasn’t just a routine gain, it was the throw that lifted Prescott beyond the long-standing yardage total set by Tony Romo.While the moment may have been brief in real time, its significance stretches across decades of Cowboys football. For a quarterback once questioned, doubted, and scrutinized beyond reason, this record feels like more than a statistic. It’s a marker of tenure, durability, and belief, both in himself and from an organization that put its future in his hands.Passing Romo’s mark of 34,183 career yards is more than a symbolic handoff between eras; it reflects Prescott’s evolution into a modern quarterback who blends accuracy with resilience.Prescott already holds the franchise record for most completions, highest completion percentage, and best passer rating, and now he adds the yardage crown to that résumé.These achievements don’t exist in isolation, they speak to a QB who consistently elevates his offense through rhythm, positioning, and trust in his receivers.Even in the midst of a tough contest against the Philadelphia Eagles, where the Cowboys trailed 21–14 entering the final quarter, Prescott showcased that trademark composure. By that point, he was 18 of 26 for 254 yards with two touchdowns and one pick, numbers that reflect not just ability but poise under scoreboard pressure.What’s particularly compelling is the generational shift this milestone represents. For many fans, Romo was the face of the Cowboys, brilliant in flashes, dogged by injuries, and forever one step short of postseason destiny. Prescott’s journey couldn’t be more different. From a fourth-round draft pick to a franchise cornerstone, he has redefined expectations while adding a steadier, more efficient statistical footprint.This record doesn’t guarantee championships, but it does solidify Prescott’s name in the Cowboys’ historical narrative. Whether he ultimately delivers Dallas another Lombardi Trophy remains the defining question. But for now, in the story of Cowboys quarterbacks, Dak Prescott has undeniably claimed a record that speaks volumes about both his performance and his permanence.Also Read: Brittany Mahomes turns Arrowhead into a runway with radiant red game-day style and heartfelt support for Patrick Mahomes","Dak Prescott has officially become the most prolific passer in Dallas Cowboys history, surpassing Tony Romo's long-standing yardage record.

She openly discusses managing the emotional load of the NFL season, allowing Patrick to focus on his career.

Brittany’s game-day fashion and quiet leadership behind Patrick’s success

Brittany Mahomes didn’t just show up to the Kansas City Chiefs’ home game against the Colts, she arrived. In a sea of fans layered in team merch and winter gear, Brittany glowed in a bold cherry-red windbreaker that instantly signaled energy, confidence, and Chiefs pride. She greeted Patrick Mahomes on the sideline with a quick, affectionate moment that was more than a cute exchange, it was a glimpse into a long-standing partnership built on consistency, loyalty, and mutual drive.The couple, who started dating in high school, have built a life that balances NFL pressure with genuine family presence, and Brittany’s visibility at games has evolved into its own cultural touchpoint in Chiefs fandom.What makes Brittany Mahomes so compelling isn’t just her fashion, it’s her function. She has organically grown into a powerhouse figure in the Mahomes family dynamic. On and off-camera, she’s talked openly about carrying the emotional load of the NFL season.As she shared on the “WHOOP” podcast: “I understand that, during football season, Patrick’s with football and so I take on a lot of the things that I can just to make his life a little bit stressful outside of football.”That intentional effort is echoed by Patrick himself, who has publicly acknowledged her role in keeping him steady and focused. On “Impaulsive,” he praised her work ethic and heart: “I think people don’t even realize how much she does… [She’s] a Hall of Fame mom and a Hall of Fame wife.”Brittany’s game-day appearances mirror her larger influence: she is a brand builder, a mom of three, a businesswoman, and increasingly, a style icon for NFL culture. She doesn’t just dress for the camera, she dresses for identity.Whether in custom Kristin Juszczyk jacket designs or simplistic jeans-and-tank outfits, Brittany’s choices always nod back to Patrick’s No. 15 and their family legacy. Her friendship with Taylor Swift only elevated that visibility, but the core of her role remains unchanged: she shows up, she supports, and she amplifies the family name with grace and boldness.Also Read: “Not be able to walk”: Patrick Mahomes’ mom Randi shares emotional health confession after completing challenging Colorado hike","Brittany Mahomes has become a significant figure in Chiefs fandom.

Taylor Swift’s disappearing act at Chiefs games—and why it’s completely intentional,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/taylor-swifts-disappearing-act-at-chiefs-gamesand-why-its-completely-intentional/articleshow/125527710.cms,"Taylor Swift's discreet presence at NFL games is a deliberate strategy to reclaim personal autonomy amidst intense media scrutiny. She prioritizes supporting Travis Kelce over being a broadcast spectacle, demonstrating a new approach to public relationships by controlling her visibility. This selective presence sends a powerful message about maintaining boundaries.

Taylor Swift’s low-profile approach shows how fame control and personal boundaries coexist

Taylor Swift’s absence from the camera’s gaze at the Kansas City Chiefs’ home game against the Indianapolis Colts isn’t a sign of disengagement, it’s a strategic withdrawal. Over the past year, Swift has shifted from being visibly present in luxury suites to becoming nearly invisible, even when she’s physically in the stadium.This is not about secrecy for secrecy’s sake, it’s about reclaiming autonomy in a world where her facial expression during a third-down play can dominate social media. Swift has demonstrated that she’s not interested in being the NFL ’s weekly broadcast attraction; she’s focused on being Travis Kelce’s partner first, not involuntary halftime entertainment. And with increasing scrutiny, she’s decided that not being seen sends its own message.Swift’s quiet game-day presence began by design. A source previously shared she aimed to stay more discreet because the attention had been “getting too excessive.” But Swift herself has openly acknowledged her ability to keep a low profile.During one BBC Radio 2 interview, she joked about her near-superhuman stealth: “Just put me in a garbage can, roll me, I don’t care. Honestly, I can fit in like, a purse. Sometimes I just can’t deal with it [the paparazzi and attention] and in those times, I won’t deal with it.I’m just digging tunnels under every building I go into, airlifting in through the skylight.”Her philosophy isn’t new. In Time, she explained how unpredictable broadcasts are: “I don’t know how they know what suite I’m in,” adding that she has “no awareness of if I’m being shown too much and pissing off a few dads, Brads, and Chads.”Ultimately, Swift’s game-day presence has never been a branding exercise. As she clarified: “I’m just there to support Travis.” That distinction matters. It suggests she’s redefining what it means to be a sports partner in the public eye, visible enough to show love, but invisible enough to keep control. And if she was at Arrowhead and simply went unseen? That may not be a disappearance, but a masterclass in selective visibility.Also Read: “Making her teenage dream…come true”: Taylor Swift’s lavish floral wedding vision with Travis Kelce includes $1.2 million mansion makeover",Taylor Swift’s low-profile approach shows how fame control and personal boundaries coexist.

Beyond the shock, a wave of compassion has emerged, with teammates and rivals uniting to honor his memory and promote mental health awareness. His legacy now calls for greater understanding and support for athletes' well-being.

Fresh reflections on the life and tragic final hours of Marshawn Kneeland

The loss of Dallas Cowboys defensive end Marshawn Kneeland has shaken the NFL community at a deeply human level. While the initial shock centered on the abruptness of his passing, the days that followed brought a clearer picture of a young athlete wrestling silently with overwhelming emotional pain.The tragedy isn’t just about a vehicle chase or the final locations captured on cameras, it is about a 24-year-old man who wasn’t just a player, but a soon-to-be father, a teammate, and someone who clearly left a lasting impact on those around him. His story forces a difficult but necessary conversation about the mental strain placed on athletes, especially in high-pressure environments like the NFL.What stands out most in the aftermath is not the chaos of the final hours, but the outpouring of compassion since. From the front office down to fans, there’s a collective shift toward celebrating who Kneeland was rather than how he died. The Cowboys leadership made it clear that they “take care of their own,” offering support for the family and ensuring that Kneeland’s memory isn’t reduced to headlines.His girlfriend’s heartfelt appeal ,“As I continue honoring Marshawn’s memory, I’m trying to gather as many photos and memories of him as possible…”, became a rallying point for the public to share stories and snapshots of joy, not tragedy.On the field, his fellow players carried his face across their warm-up shirts, while Raiders players highlighted a suicide-prevention helpline on their jerseys, symbolizing unity beyond rivalry.Dak Prescott, who has personally faced emotional adversity, voiced what many felt: “It was a blessing to be out here, this is where the healing happens for me. We love Marshawn, we’re going to continue to shine a light for him and we’re blessed to continue his light for him.”Kneeland’s death leaves behind more than grief, it leaves a reminder that behind every jersey number is a human story. In remembering him, the NFL community has an opportunity to push forward conversations on emotional well-being, support systems, and the pressures that young athletes navigate. His legacy now becomes not just his talent on the field, but the call to recognize vulnerability, connection, and compassion off of it.Also Read; “Please pray for my girl”: Prayers pour in for Cowboys icon Michael Irvin after heartbreaking and emotional personal update","Dallas Cowboys defensive end Marshawn Kneeland, 24, was killed in a car chase.

Initially conforming to industry demands, she later embraced clothing that aligned with her values of health, autonomy, and well-being. From iconic, revealing moments to comfortable, movement-focused attire, her fashion choices now authentically express her life, marking a significant shift towards self-expression and empowerment.

Gisele Bündchen’s personal style reflects a shift from being dressed by the industry to dressing for herself

Gisele Bündchen’s career has always appeared effortless from the outside, a golden-haired supermodel gliding down runways and fronting major campaigns. But behind that public image was a young woman learning to navigate an unforgiving fashion world, often forced into aesthetics and expectations that didn’t align with her personal comfort. Her style didn’t just evolve with trends, it evolved with her values.From denim-clad beginnings in São Paulo to the confident, movement-focused wardrobe of her life today, Bündchen’s fashion timeline mirrors her transformation as a person, not just as a model. Her clothing choices reveal a journey toward agency, body autonomy, health, and emotional grounding, a story that deepens our understanding of a global fashion icon.Early in her career, Bündchen wore what she was told, sometimes proudly, sometimes painfully. The most striking example was the McQueen runway moment when she walked nearly nude, crying backstage as makeup artists painted fake tears to hide her real ones. That moment marked a lasting internal shift: the realization that being “chosen” didn’t mean being understood.The Victoria’s Secret contract ensured financial stability, but Bündchen later acknowledged that “I felt less and less at ease being photographed walking the runway wearing just a bikini or a thong.”Her eventual refusal to renew the contract wasn’t rebellion, it was release.As she stepped into motherhood, health and purpose began shaping her daily outfits; soft knits, denim, breathable athletic wear. She stopped dressing for spectacle and started dressing for living. Her 2015 return to denim at her final runway show was more than nostalgic, it was symbolic.It honored the girl she was and validated the woman she became. Today, when Bündchen hikes in leggings or shares yoga clips captioned “Movement is medicine,” her clothes are no longer costumes, they’re authentic extensions of her life.Also Read: Tom Brady's ex-wife Gisele Bündchen debuts a Gen Z–favorite hairstyle while sharing a rare, heartfelt glimpse into life with Joaquim Valente","Gisele Bündchen’s career has always appeared effortless from the outside, a golden-haired supermodel gliding down runways.

When will Taylor Swift release the ‘Opalite’ music video? Is Travis Kelce one of the rumored cameos?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/when-will-taylor-swift-release-the-opalite-music-video-is-travis-kelce-one-of-the-rumored-cameos/articleshow/125520800.cms,"Taylor Swift is preparing a grand Christmas surprise with her ""Opalite"" music video. Filmed secretly in London, the project features festive decorations and potential celebrity guests. The video, inspired by Travis Kelce, is set to be a major cultural moment. It aims to capture the holiday spirit and could rival established Christmas traditions.

Why Taylor Swift’s “Opalite” Christmas launch could be one of her biggest cultural plays

Taylor Swift’s upcoming “Opalite” music video is shaping up to be one of her most ambitious visual projects yet and one of the most tightly guarded. During a discreet week-long stay in London, Swift reportedly executed an entire multi-location shoot without a single photographed sighting, despite flying more than 3,500 miles by private jet and working across busy neighborhoods.What’s fascinating isn’t just the secrecy, it’s the sense that “Opalite” isn’t simply a music video, but a carefully crafted holiday moment. With its romantic tone, Christmas aesthetics, and rumored celebrity cameos, Swift appears to be building not just anticipation but a seasonal cultural event that could challenge even Mariah Carey’s annual holiday dominance.According to local accounts, production kicked off at the Mildmay Club in Stoke Newington, where extras were seen in retro outfits alongside holiday props; trees, tinsel, and even glitter cannons. To maintain continuity and precision on camera, banana milkshake was used instead of eggnog, and grape juice replaced champagne. These details suggest a polished, cinematic vision rather than a traditional glossy pop video.Filming later moved to Croydon’s Whitgift Centre, with Swift’s team reportedly renting half the derelict mall and blocking public views with screens. One witness described the operation as “military-level,” emphasizing how swiftly equipment was moved and how businesses were asked not to speak about the shoot.Fans have honed in on the possibility of cameos from Lewis Capaldi and Domhnall Gleeson, who appeared with Swift on The Graham Norton Show. Their involvement reportedly “fits the playful holiday energy of the video,” and would continue Swift’s pattern of cross-Atlantic creative partnerships.“Opalite” itself carries emotional symbolism, the track was inspired by Travis Kelce, whose birthstone is opal. Insiders say the video leans heavily into the song’s romantic core, paired with subtle Christmas instrumentation.Post-production is underway, and indications suggest Swift plans to drop the video on or before Christmas. With confidentiality agreements reportedly stricter than usual and decoy vehicles used to protect Swift’s anonymity, it’s clear this rollout is meant to culminate in “a proper Christmas surprise” for fans, one that could dominate streaming, headlines, and the holiday charts.Also Read: “Making her teenage dream…come true”: Taylor Swift’s lavish floral wedding vision with Travis Kelce includes $1.2 million mansion makeover","Taylor Swift is preparing a grand Christmas surprise with her ""Opalite"" music video.

What made Tom Brady tear up regarding his parenthood

A 2022 video of Tom Brady getting emotional was quite talked about at one point and also became meme fodder. However, fans have consistently defended their idol and have said that the context of the video was truly emotional, and they had a heartfelt response to it.Despite what social media said, in reality, the clip is deeply earnest as the NFL’s greatest quarterback speaks openly about his life, his children, and the challenges of fatherhood. The footage has recently gone viral again.Tom Brady, who won seven Super Bowls along with five Super Bowl MVPs, three NFL MVPs, and 15 Pro Bowl selections, has a staggering fan following. The resurfaced video shows him choking up as he admits he doesn’t feel he measures up to his own father and says he feels “haunted” by that.Brady shares three children with ex-wife Gisele Bündchen and former partner Bridget Moynahan. He originally discussed these emotions in a candid 2022 interview.""When I think about being a dad, I think about him because of what my dad meant to me. And I know I'm not as good a father to my kids as my dad was to me,"" Brady says in the video.Earlier this year, Gisele, who shares parenting responsibilities for her two children with Tom Brady, was reportedly “infuriated” after her ex-husband made what was described as a “petty” dig at her parenting, according to a report.It’s no secret that Gisele’s frustration mainly stemmed from Tom’s decision to reverse his retirement and play for the Buccaneers late in his career and it’s possible that Tom took a swipe at Gisele in his newsletter.'I think part of being a great father is being a great example of doing what it takes to take care of your family,' Brady wrote. 'I chose to do it by playing football.'He continued, 'My dedication to the sport, the hours of practice, the moments when I was laser focused - those were times when I believe I was doing the best possible thing for my family and my kids, by prioritizing my profession and teaching, by example, what it takes to be really good at your job, what it takes to follow through on commitments, what it takes to be a great teammate; and showing them, also by example, that work is a big part of all of our lives. '",Brady shares three children with ex-wife Gisele Bündchen and former partner Bridget Moynahan.

While Paige Beuckers secured Rookie of the Year, the teams as a whole had one of the worst seasons last year, with a record of 10-34. Having won the lottery now, the Wings have a chance to pair a strong and fresh talent with Paige Bueckers and lead the team to new heights.The teams that came next in the list are the Minnesota Lynx, the Seattle Storm, the Washington Mystics and the Chicago Sky. Even though the list of prospects is not a star-studded one this time, however, some potential athletes could turn the tables for the team. Some of these athletes are Azzi Fudd, Awa Fam, Olivia Miles and Lauren Betts.The Dallas Wings came first with 42% chances for the No.1 pick. Following up, it was the Minnesota Lynx with 26.1% chances and the Seattle Storm with 16.7% chances. This is the second time the Wings have come on top for the second consecutive time. Now that all these teams are ready for their picks, the list of top prospects is also ready. Lauren Betts is leading the list. The 6-foot-7 UCLA, with her unique footwork and dunk skills, has left a mark in her college career.She averaged 20.5 points, 9.2 rebounds and 2.5 blocks.Next in the list is UConn’s Azzi Fudd. The 5-foot-11 athlete is one of the cleanest shooters. However, the lack of consistency in delivering results due to her health issues is a major disadvantage for the player. Azzi decided to improve her pro-game and had opted for an additional year at UConn. It seems like now the player is ready.Other noted players in the list include Olivia Miles and Awa Fam. Miles is a TCU transfer from Notre Dame. The 5-10 point guard has improved her game as a perimeter shooter. Awa is from Spain and has played since she was 15 years old. Her average stands at 8.7 points and 4.2 rebounds during Spain’s run at the Eurobasket Finals. With the teams being in place and the players list ready, fans will now have to wait and see which player goes where.","The WNBA draft lottery 2026 took place on November 23, 2025.

With standout acting roles in A Low Down Dirty Shame and the long-running sci-fi series Eureka, she transitioned into directing and producing with remarkable success.The Emmy-nominated filmmaker continues to expand her impact, steering major projects like HBO’s upcoming Task starring Mark Ruffalo. She’s also returning to direct the final episodes of The Gilded Age Season 3.Her résumé reflects decades of versatility, from Luke Cage and The Wheel of Time to Scandal, American Gods, and SEE.

Shaunie Henderson said her marriage with Shaquille O’Neal “began to crumble”

Shaquille O’Neal accepted responsibility for their fractured relationship



Shaunie Henderson’s memoir offered a rare look back at a marriage that once captivated the sports world, revealing how her relationship with Shaquille O’Neal had begun to deteriorate long before their divorce in 2011. What fans saw as a glamorous partnership, she recalled as a union quietly weakening under the weight of distance, rumors, and emotional gaps she didn’t recognize at first. While raising their blended family and navigating the fast pace of NBA life, Henderson believed she was protecting the home they had built. In reality, she wrote, the earliest signs of strain had already taken root.In her memoir, Undefeated: Changing the Rules and Winning on My Own Terms, Shaunie Henderson reflected on the subtle shifts that marked the beginning of the end. Her days were filled with raising their children and managing life around O’Neal’s superstar career, but she sensed something changing. She said the problems started like faint symptoms she ignored until they grew harder to overlook.One issue, she wrote, was O’Neal’s habit of “going missing,” even though staff handled the daily responsibilities at home. When the Lakers sent him to Miami, she heard whispers about a condo in Miami Beach.“When we moved to Miami, I even heard a rumor that he had a condo in Miami Beach. I started to get suspicious, but he always had an answer, and I could never prove anything. Eventually, I was forced to admit that my family life wasn’t as blissful or perfect as I wanted to believe. ”The children, she later discovered, had grown used to their father’s absence because of his demanding schedule. When she finally pursued divorce, she expected turmoil, only to learn they had adapted to a home where emotional presence had already been uneven. That realization, she said, shaped how she viewed those final years of the marriage.Shaquille O’Neal had long acknowledged that the marriage failed because of his own behavior. In his memoir Shaq Uncut: My Story, he admitted he “was a guy with too many options,” and in later interviews, he said he “was bad… It was all me.” After Henderson’s latest revelations surfaced, he didn’t dispute her version of events. Instead, he posted, “I understand… I wouldn’t have been in love with me either. Wishing you all the best… All love, Shaq. ”Their separation played out over several years. O’Neal filed for divorce in 2007, they reconciled, then split again before finalizing their divorce in 2011. Henderson said she stayed longer because she valued family above everything and feared the emotional impact on their children.Henderson later built her own financial independence through Basketball Wives and eventually remarried in 2022. O’Neal publicly wished her well, saying, “Shaunie was also a perfect woman and I messed it up… I will always protect, provide and love for her — married or not.”Also Read: ""It can be challenging sometimes”: Stephen Curry's wife Ayesha Curry opens up about their marriage and their challenging lifestyle",Shaunie Henderson said her marriage with Shaquille O’Neal “began to crumble” She said the problems started like faint symptoms she ignored until they grew harder to overlook.

Tristan Thompson and Khloe Kardashian ended their relationship in 2021. However, the duo have not cut off ties entirely. They continue to co-parent their children together. Khloe and Tristan were spotted together in several instances, and Kim Kardashian’s comment during a recent podcast fueled speculation about the duo reuniting. Khloe decided to clear the air once and for all during the recent “Ask me anything” episode of Khloe in Wonderland.According to Kim’s statement, Tristan used to visit Khloe’s home and “tuck in” the kids during the offseason. The question in Khloe in Wonderland was a deep dive into Khloe's journey of healing and getting herself to a place where she could face Tristan without any breakdowns. Khloe continued to explain the process while also clearing the rumor about the duo being back together.During the “Ask Me Anything” episode of Khloe in Wonderland, the American socialite narrated her healing journey. It took a lot for her to develop a good co-parenting relationship with Tristan Thompson. She started off saying, “Tristan and I, we have a good co-parenting relationship. I think what I find funny is that people are always like, ‘How did you let Tristan back in?’ Well, Tristan is not back in.” Khloe decided to come clean about the nature of the relationship she shared with the Canadian basketball player.She further continued, “He is just the father of my kids. So he is going around to be around his kids, and I am really grateful that he is. I love that he has a great relationship with his kids. He wants to be with his kids and they want to be with him. I think that’s a beautiful blessing. I am never going to get in the way of that.” Khloe further added, “It is so important for that relationship to maintain and be as strong as possible. And because we live close, it is easy for him to come over and do those things.”Khloe explained how Tristan would come over only for the kids and would leave once they were asleep. It took a lot of therapy and self-healing sessions for her to reach to this stage. The American Socialite is no longer attached to Tristan, and hence it is easier for her to see the man inside their house. Khloe also added how Tristan’s NBA schedule also helped her in the journey, because then the athlete would get only 3 months in a year to visit his children.","Tristan Thompson and Khloe Kardashian ended their relationship in 2021.

What did Michael Porter Jr. say about Sophie Cunningham? WNBA star's candid admission sparks surprising twist in NBA star's viral claim,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nba/top-stories/what-did-michael-porter-jr-say-about-sophie-cunningham-wnba-stars-candid-admission-sparks-surprising-twist-in-nba-stars-viral-claim/articleshow/125527337.cms,"Michael Porter Jr. and Sophie Cunningham are good friends (Image via Instagram / @curiousmike)

Sophie Cunningham’s unusually honest take adds a surprising new dimension to Michael Porter Jr.’s controversial claim

Sophie Cunningham recently responded to Michael Porter Jr.'s most recent contentious opinion of her. She publicly addressed and rejected his now-viral opinion that a squad of WNBA All-Stars might be defeated by an eighth-grade boys' team. The Indiana Fever shooter acknowledged that she is aware of the Brooklyn Nets forward remarks during Show Me Something's most recent episode.Cunningham's comment came after NBA star Michael Porter Jr. made a number of divisive remarks about his belief that the world's top women's basketball players couldn't compete with top high school men's basketball players. After his remarks on this week's ""Ball in the Family"" podcast regarding the NBA vs. WNBA dispute, Michael Porter Jr. became the focus of social media attention.During the same podcast, Porter claimed that he could succeed in the WNBA as an eighth-grade version of himself. He used his sister's University of Missouri squad to support his claim. Sophie Cunningham and other players who would later join the WNBA were on that team, which Porter claimed he totally dominated.Cunningham then addressed Porter's remarks on her podcast, Show Me Something.She said that eighth-grade boys frequently have a physical advantage over adult ladies while speaking with West Wilson.Cunningham also wondered why the subject continues to come up. She then said:“So I would say that’s like probably true. I mean, it’s probably true. I don’t want to be like unrealistic or delusional, like men are just stronger, bigger, athletic. Like they just are a different build. And if so, if you put them up against females, well, yeah, they’re going to win.”Cunningham then said that Porter was taken out of context and his major point is rather clear. She added:""If you are a professional football player, basketball player, really any sport... If you're in that elite level group, yeah, you should be able to beat the girls.. I'm not surprised by that. I just don't get why it's continuing to get brought up.""She further said that by the time future NBA players are in eighth grade, they are already well on their way to developing pro-ready bodies and skillsets. She suspects that Porter is right from the standpoint that a pro player could beat a high school girls' player -- and as the players age, the advantages for males remain clear, even if female players can ""outshoot"" or ""pass the s— out of"" the ball. She continued:""If women are saying, 'He couldn't beat them,' yeah, he could. Any NBA star could beat a female in high school. ... I don't want to be unrealistic or delusional, Like, men are just stronger, bigger, athletic. They just are a different build. So if you put them up against females, yeah, they're gonna win.""Nevertheless, of of now, after Soph’s comment, Michael Porter Jr. hasn’t addressed the remark as of yet.Also read: Are Michael Porter Jr. and Sophie Cunningham?

A perfectly timed celestial illusion turns Stephen Curry’s new book launch into an unexpectedly magical

NBA icon Stephen Curry's book ""Shot Ready,"" was released in September and has gotten very positive reviews. Amazon immediately placed it at the top of its sports book charts and among its top 10 current best-sellers. It has further received a lot of traction.Now, after almost two months, ad agency the Known team brought Steph Curry's game to life by timing an OUTFRONT Media billboard to coincide with November's supermoon. It gave the impression that he was actually shooting the moon. The billboard came after he launched his New York Times Best Seller Shot Ready with Penguin Random House.The promotional billboard for his book, ""Shot Ready,"" was timed to coincide with the supermoon in November 2025, giving the impression that Curry was actually shooting the moon. The advertising firm Known, Penguin Random House, and photographer Squint collaborated creatively on this campaign.Known combined Squint's powerful photography with science by mapping the supermoon's position and elevation with an internal astrophysicist. Their page has described the whole idea as:“It transforms timing into the medium. A simple, iconic visual—Steph releasing a shot—meets a celestial moment the whole city can witness. The result is pure OOH logic: big, bold, instantly legible, and built for the camera roll…”Additionally, as per the caption of the ad agency’s Instagram post:“To help promote Steph Curry’s New York Times Best Seller “Shot Ready” for our partners at Penguin Random House, we set out to bring his game-defining philosophy to life…”It continued”“Working with legendary photographer Squint’s powerful imagery, our Known team combined a big creative idea with science, including our own staff astrophysicist and media experts, to time an OUTFRONT Media billboard installation with November’s supermoon - aligning Steph’s image so it appears he’s shooting the moon itself…”With almost 400 pages and over 100 photos, the star guard for the Golden State Warriors stated that he is merely attempting to provide fans with a fresh perspective on his thoughts and methods. Curry said:“We wanted to have something tangible, not just from a sports perspective but from a life perspective and show all the different highs and lows that I’ve been through and what people have instilled in me..It just made sense, especially while I’m still under the bright lights on the court playing. It’s a moment of reflection but also for me, it’s a moment to motivate me to keep going and get everything else I can out of this game. ”The book is the most recent addition to Curry's expanding empire. He owns his Curry brand with Under Armor, runs a multimedia company, and is currently involved in the bourbon industry. He recently revealed plans for a restaurant, is attempting to expand golf by making it more accessible, and has a nonprofit with his wife, Ayesha Curry, that is primarily focused on giving meals and educational opportunities to underprivileged kids.Also read: ""I will be watching""- Los Angeles Lakers legend LeBron James’ cryptic Olympic hint sparks surprising future twist with Stephen Curry","Steph Curry's new book, ""Shot Ready,"" was released in September.
